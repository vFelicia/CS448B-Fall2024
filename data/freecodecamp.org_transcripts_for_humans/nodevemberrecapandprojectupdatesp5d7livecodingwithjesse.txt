00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and today i have a
00:09 - lot of stuff to talk about
00:11 - we probably won't be doing that much
00:13 - coding so i hope that's all right but
00:16 - i want to give you a little recap of how
00:19 - things were at november
00:21 - and then
00:23 - we have a lot of stuff coming up
00:26 - this month and in in january so i want
00:29 - to give you all an overview of all the
00:30 - different things that we'll be working
00:32 - on
00:33 - and then if you'd like to
00:34 - you know help work on some of those
00:36 - things
00:38 - that'd be great i'll probably make repos
00:41 - for everything that i talk about today
00:43 - soon if there aren't already repos for
00:45 - them and then we can you know start
00:48 - opening issues and pull requests
00:50 - some of these projects can be really fun
00:52 - uh technologies we haven't worked with
00:54 - before
00:55 - so i'm
00:56 - hoping that
00:59 - i'm hoping this will be exciting to hear
01:01 - all this news and it'll make up for the
01:03 - lack of of code
01:06 - so first off uh let me talk
01:09 - about
01:12 - november
01:13 - sorry
01:14 - okay there we go the analytics on
01:17 - youtube were saying that no one was
01:19 - watching for a long time so just
01:21 - checking
01:22 - so november was really really fun and i
01:27 - i talked about
01:29 - my experience with with this stream with
01:32 - with live coding and i got a
01:34 - just so many positive comments
01:36 - afterwards
01:38 - uh it was amazing it went you know
01:40 - better than i could have hoped for
01:42 - uh so the video of my talk is on my
01:45 - youtube channel so it's the first video
01:48 - on the channel right now
01:50 - i can paste in a link for you all
01:53 - let me do that now
01:57 - and
01:58 - that way you can check it out if you
01:59 - want uh maybe i'll put a link in the
02:02 - description for those of you who are
02:03 - watching the recording hopefully i
02:05 - remember to do that and we'll put it in
02:07 - i don't always remember to put in the
02:09 - links when i say i'm going to
02:12 - all right so here's the link now in the
02:16 - live chat
02:18 - and um
02:19 - of course you're probably not going to
02:20 - want to watch it right now if you missed
02:22 - the stream
02:24 - um
02:26 - but uh
02:30 - oh okay cool it looks like uh rook
02:32 - already watched it
02:33 - um
02:34 - do you like the humble joke cool i
02:39 - yeah i i thought it was cool i thought
02:40 - it was funny
02:43 - i'm drinking the worst coffee i've ever
02:45 - had in my life right now
02:48 - i don't know how long had been sitting
02:50 - in the pot right because i was gone in
02:52 - nashville for the last three days so
02:54 - it's entirely possible that coffee's
02:56 - been sitting there for more than a day
02:58 - i just warmed it up the microwave for a
03:00 - long time hoping to kill any bacteria
03:04 - and it's really bad
03:07 - but um i didn't have time to actually
03:09 - make fresh coffee because the stream was
03:11 - starting
03:12 - so
03:14 - alright so let me talk a little bit
03:16 - about
03:17 - uh the cool things at november
03:19 - and and then we'll get to the project so
03:21 - if anybody happens to be watching the
03:23 - stream and you're at november uh say hi
03:26 - in the live chat
03:27 - if you can
03:29 - and that'd be really cool
03:34 - so
03:35 - just some of the highlights and if
03:37 - anybody's watching and you're a speaker
03:39 - or i talk to you in november and i
03:41 - forget to bring up bring you up is one
03:43 - of the highlights i apologize
03:46 - but it's hard to remember things being
03:48 - on the spot live
03:49 - so
03:50 - uh cool thing
03:51 - gabrielle from microsoft
03:54 - she did a
03:57 - node robotics workshop that was amazing
04:01 - we actually built
04:03 - a
04:04 - a node bot that was a little car that
04:06 - you could control
04:08 - with node from your keyboard so the code
04:10 - was literally like
04:13 - um you know when you press the right
04:15 - arrow key
04:16 - uh then
04:18 - the node bot will go right so it was
04:20 - controlling uh the wheels based on
04:24 - uh like we had a little battery pack and
04:26 - this little thing called a photon which
04:28 - is kind of like an arduino i mean it was
04:30 - really cool a little motor
04:33 - so cool um so and i actually got to keep
04:36 - the stuff for the nodebot
04:39 - so i think i took it apart to bring it
04:41 - home and i think i'm going to make it
04:42 - with my kids so
04:44 - that was a really kind of cool highlight
04:47 - don't know that i'll use it for my job
04:49 - here
04:51 - but
04:52 - it was it was fun to see how that works
04:55 - and maybe i'll find some some practical
04:57 - use for it around here
04:59 - um also
05:01 - uh there was a great talk um
05:06 - about the one of the keynotes from ben
05:09 - ben alegbedu
05:10 - uh gave a talk on why eventbrite
05:13 - switched to react uh so he wrote this
05:15 - really long like 19 page paper
05:18 - convincing everyone at eventbrite why
05:20 - react was the way to go and they were
05:22 - switching from backbone and there were a
05:24 - lot of cool things in there that i had
05:26 - never considered that was a good reason
05:28 - to go with react so i i really like that
05:32 - uh let me think what else um there is a
05:35 - cool presentation from someone at github
05:38 - uh her name was
05:41 - shelley so shelly from github
05:43 - gave a presentation on async await which
05:46 - was really cool because we've started
05:47 - using that in some of our projects and
05:50 - it was cool to learn about
05:53 - she basically went through the history
05:54 - of how you do things like that so from
05:57 - callbacks uh to promises talked a little
06:00 - bit about generators and then onto async
06:02 - await so it gave me like a nice overview
06:04 - of how that sort of thing has been
06:07 - handled in javascript
06:09 - so
06:11 - very useful
06:12 - and i know i'm forgetting so many other
06:14 - things but i mean really the biggest
06:16 - highlight was meeting so many developers
06:18 - from all over um really all over the
06:21 - united states from so many different
06:22 - companies um from big companies like
06:25 - microsoft i actually met um and got to
06:28 - talk to marie from microsoft who works
06:31 - on the
06:33 - um
06:34 - office uh was it the outlook app
06:38 - uh she builds micro services for the
06:39 - outlook app which is cool all the way to
06:42 - like local um
06:44 - small companies that were local in
06:46 - nashville that talk from you know devs
06:48 - from there
06:49 - uh just really cool i got to talk to
06:51 - some people from heroku
06:53 - and um
06:55 - netlify
06:57 - and that's actually gonna i'm gonna
06:59 - bring that up later when we talk about
07:01 - our projects because i think we're going
07:02 - to do some stuff with netlify and
07:03 - possibly with heroku as well
07:07 - so anyway if anybody from
07:10 - november happens to be watching now or
07:13 - later on you watch the recording
07:15 - um
07:16 - you all were awesome especially anybody
07:18 - who i talked to
07:20 - um
07:21 - you're awesome i enjoyed so much you
07:24 - know meeting everyone and talking
07:25 - everybody was just so nice
07:27 - and
07:28 - um so hopefully some of those people
07:31 - from november will start watching the
07:32 - stream occasionally and we can keep in
07:34 - touch
07:36 - all right so let me check the live chat
07:38 - quickly to see if there's any node
07:39 - member related questions uh and then
07:42 - we'll move on um
07:44 - also i guess one other thing
07:47 - the uh the free stuff at november was
07:50 - awesome i got
07:52 - cool t-shirts i'm wearing i don't know
07:54 - how i can show you i'm not i'm not gonna
07:56 - try to show you but i'm wearing heroku
07:58 - socks right now which look really cool
08:01 - i've got a bunch of stickers
08:03 - um
08:04 - free time uh on heroku so um
08:08 - 500 free dino hours on heroku
08:11 - i did get a cool fidget spinner um from
08:15 - oh no it doesn't say the the company
08:17 - name i'm sorry i really wanted to give
08:19 - him a shout out but it doesn't say the
08:20 - name i got
08:23 - a cool water bottle that is branded for
08:25 - november so anyway
08:26 - [Music]
08:28 - highly recommend going to november if
08:30 - you can uh for 2018.
08:32 - i'll try to go back there if i can it
08:34 - was really cool um maybe they want me to
08:37 - speak again i don't know i have to come
08:38 - up with something different to talk
08:39 - about
08:42 - um
08:44 - so
08:45 - as we said let's see
08:48 - how brett said jesse you deserve a fresh
08:50 - cup every day fresh cup of coffee
08:52 - thanks for that
08:54 - um
08:58 - oh cool john says i'm a natural at
09:00 - talking yeah that's
09:03 - yeah it seems like i have the talking
09:04 - down i just need to talk less in code
09:06 - more right that's the
09:09 - that's what everyone says
09:17 - street fighter motorcycles says i look
09:19 - at the screen i have a notification from
09:21 - you i push the button and you're talking
09:22 - about this thing
09:24 - drinking bad coffee what are you talking
09:26 - about i'm worried now my blood pressure
09:28 - is up
09:31 - uh i got a hard thing please i need to
09:33 - know if the coffee is good i'm worried
09:36 - the coffee is terrible
09:41 - that's what i get for trying to warm up
09:43 - old coffee i have no idea how old it is
09:46 - um
09:48 - shri count says tell us about tell us
09:50 - something about november i'm new to your
09:52 - channel um oh yeah if you're not i keep
09:54 - saying november i didn't explain
09:56 - anything about what it was it's a
09:57 - javascript conference uh specifically
09:59 - geared around
10:01 - node but there were a lot of talks about
10:03 - front-end stuff as well uh node.js being
10:06 - javascript that can run on the
10:09 - on the server
10:11 - uh so
10:12 - really good conference it was in
10:13 - nashville tennessee a lot of the talks
10:16 - were about react um or like somewhat
10:19 - react related stuff like graphql which
10:22 - is frequently used with react
10:25 - but then there was other stuff like the
10:27 - nodebot thing
10:28 - that had nothing to do with react
10:31 - just you know reacts just really popular
10:33 - now so anyway so i got a lot from it
10:36 - because we work with react and um
10:39 - so there are a lot of things
10:41 - you know that i
10:43 - can apply now to our projects
10:48 - all right
10:49 - oh i guess someone from argentina hey
10:51 - how's it going also from new york great
10:54 - and um
10:55 - actually i met
10:57 - three people in november from the
10:59 - dominican republic which was awesome
11:00 - because i've never met anyone from the
11:02 - dominican republic before
11:04 - and then now within like two days i met
11:06 - three people and they're all really
11:08 - really nice awesome people so
11:11 - if anybody's from the dominican republic
11:13 - watching uh
11:14 - say hi
11:16 - and um
11:17 - let's see
11:19 - oh someone from brazil from bosnia
11:21 - awesome yeah people from all over i love
11:24 - it
11:25 - uh okay so now let me move into some of
11:29 - our projects
11:31 - i'm gonna throw a lot of stuff at you
11:34 - oh cool we got someone from dominican
11:36 - republic
11:39 - great
11:43 - let me angel eduardo rodriguez felix
11:50 - awesome hey i'm from dominican republic

11:54 - from dominican republic here
11:58 - all right we have some from india i
11:59 - always have people from india india is
12:01 - well represented i think in the uh in
12:04 - the streams it's awesome and i always am
12:06 - like amazed that you all in india stay
12:08 - up so late to watch this and uh thanks
12:11 - thank you for that that's like
12:13 - it's amazing to me that that you are
12:15 - willing to stay up
12:17 - um
12:19 - oh kenya awesome if someone from kenya
12:23 - all right so i'm going to throw a lot at
12:24 - you with these projects now so
12:28 - um
12:31 - i'm not going to go in depth into any
12:33 - one of them because i want to make sure
12:34 - i get them all in and then if there's
12:36 - questions you have about any of the
12:38 - projects let me know and then i'll talk
12:40 - more about the projects that you are
12:42 - more interested in and i'll just kind of
12:44 - go quickly through the stuff that maybe
12:46 - is not so interesting to you
12:49 - let's see uh
12:51 - from the ukraine we have algeria norway
12:55 - awesome
12:57 - yeah urine from from norway i i remember
13:01 - thank you for reminding me
13:03 - um
13:06 - because i remember i had trouble
13:07 - pronouncing that at one time so
13:10 - um
13:11 - okay so let's talk about let's talk
13:14 - first about the project we've been
13:15 - working on right because i did uh say
13:18 - that this was still part of project five
13:21 - so i want to make sure we talk about
13:23 - project five so it's not misleading
13:26 - so that's this main website that we've
13:28 - been building we started in gatsby and
13:30 - then we switched to react but we kept
13:32 - our gatsby branch open
13:34 - so here's what i'm thinking all right i
13:36 - had i merged some pull requests in so
13:38 - thank you for everybody for the pull
13:40 - request
13:41 - and um i will maybe i'll go over that
13:43 - and at some point today or tomorrow
13:47 - we had a cup at least one person it was
13:49 - their first pull request i think so
13:50 - congratulations on that
13:53 - but
13:54 - i talked to
13:57 - some people
13:59 - who know
14:01 - a lot more about gatsby than i do
14:04 - and
14:06 - i think
14:08 - that it will be
14:10 - very doable
14:13 - to do this site
14:15 - in gatsby
14:17 - before
14:18 - i was kind of not sure about it
14:20 - you know
14:22 - partly because i i'd never used gatsby
14:23 - before so i i really just had no idea no
14:26 - experience as to whether or not what we
14:28 - wanted to accomplish would be best
14:30 - accomplished with gatsby
14:33 - and i think
14:36 - that it we can and i think it may end up
14:38 - being faster so here's what i'd like to
14:40 - do
14:41 - i'd like to build out
14:44 - the sites both sites the next version
14:46 - and the gatsby version just a little bit
14:49 - more
14:50 - to the point where we're actually
14:51 - pulling some data from a
14:54 - like a test uh wordpress
14:57 - installation
14:58 - i will try to pull it with graphql
15:00 - and
15:02 - i'd like to set up both of them
15:05 - in a production environment
15:07 - and then test the speed
15:10 - and potentially to even test like the
15:12 - load on servers if we can
15:14 - from what i've heard at november
15:18 - gatsby
15:19 - should be faster
15:22 - if we set it up the way that i was i was
15:24 - talking about so
15:26 - um
15:28 - i think
15:32 - i i know this is crazy to keep trying to
15:34 - develop these well you know we're we're
15:36 - not that far into the development of
15:37 - this site
15:39 - so
15:42 - i don't know let me know what you all
15:44 - think about it but
15:47 - it just seems like
15:51 - it seems like the speed advantage is
15:53 - going to be significant
15:55 - um so in particular i do i want to thank
15:59 - uh brian douglas from netlify
16:02 - so i you know i doubt who he'll ever
16:05 - watch this or anything but i just want
16:07 - to thank him for taking the time to go
16:09 - through explaining a lot about how
16:12 - gatsby and netlify handle sites like
16:16 - this like where we're pulling data from
16:17 - the api
16:19 - um and how the rebuilds work and and all
16:22 - that so
16:26 - so that is the big
16:29 - the big kind of change for this project
16:32 - that will i th that we'll do it will try
16:35 - to do so if anybody is more interested
16:38 - in working with gatsby than you are with
16:39 - next
16:40 - feel free to start working on the branch
16:43 - what i'd like to do is keep them as
16:44 - similar as possible so in terms of ui
16:48 - it's they're going to be identical
16:50 - which should make it a little bit easier
16:52 - is you know all the ui stuff can pretty
16:54 - much just be copied
16:56 - and then the only things that will
16:58 - really change
16:59 - is um
17:01 - kind of our server setup right because
17:03 - the routing with gatsby was similar
17:05 - right it was just the stuff that's in
17:06 - the pages file i believe
17:09 - uh the pages folder i mean
17:11 - so anyway we'll have to take a closer
17:14 - look at that and work on it
17:16 - um but i have a much at least i think i
17:19 - have a much better understanding of how
17:21 - that would actually work
17:23 - uh so
17:24 - anyway
17:26 - that's big change number one
17:30 - we're gonna most likely go back and be
17:32 - doing some updates on our very first
17:34 - project that we did on the stream that
17:36 - catechetical institute website that we
17:38 - built with next wordpress the wordpress
17:40 - api
17:41 - uh we did server-side rendering a lot of
17:43 - caching in there we're doing load
17:45 - balancing on that
17:47 - so
17:48 - if you weren't with us during that
17:50 - project you know check out the repo for
17:52 - it
17:53 - uh if you go to the repo with all the
17:55 - other projects i think it's called ci
17:58 - react
18:01 - so i'm gonna probably open up some
18:02 - issues in that repository for the new
18:05 - things but just to give you a heads up
18:09 - i'm gonna have a meeting i think next
18:11 - week or the week after i can't remember
18:13 - the date with the people who are in
18:15 - charge of that that project uh the
18:18 - catechetical institute
18:20 - some of the things they've requested are
18:22 - um
18:24 - basically a
18:27 - a space kind of above the fold on the
18:30 - home page for
18:33 - uh new
18:34 - like news and and stuff so that they can
18:36 - kind of
18:38 - pin it to the top all this new stuff so
18:41 - we already have that section at the
18:42 - bottom
18:44 - so there's going to have to be some
18:45 - discussion on what this is going to look
18:47 - like
18:48 - since we already have a section that
18:49 - does exactly that
18:52 - could could we just move the section up
18:54 - and maybe redesign it so that it's not
18:56 - quite as big i don't know we'll have to
18:57 - discuss it but if you all have any
18:59 - suggestions for that let me know and
19:01 - then i could bring it up in the meeting
19:05 - or also we're going to add some new
19:06 - sections that'll basically be
19:09 - identical to some existing sections so
19:11 - that's not really even worth discussing
19:14 - um
19:16 - they'd like to
19:17 - maybe update that find a nearby event
19:20 - section that we already had the
19:22 - geolocation in but we just need to build
19:24 - out the ui so that it's obvious that you
19:26 - can use the geo location
19:29 - so we had never finished
19:31 - finished that before
19:33 - so we'll get to that
19:35 - so if anybody has any ideas for you know
19:38 - kind of an intuitive way
19:40 - uh to
19:41 - basically for a user to know that these
19:43 - fields are clickable and they could sort
19:45 - by them
19:48 - in a way that looks nice you know mobile
19:50 - desktop uh and it's pretty obvious and
19:53 - fits with the overall material design
19:55 - scheme and the particular color scheme
19:57 - for that site
20:00 - um let's see
20:03 - oh we're gonna have to do some forms
20:05 - most likely so
20:07 - it's not like we haven't done anything
20:09 - like this before but we currently don't
20:10 - have any forms
20:12 - on that site so we're gonna have
20:15 - probably two forms
20:18 - and uh so it's not gonna be a big deal i
20:21 - don't think we need file uploads at all
20:23 - so it's gonna be pretty basic but
20:26 - you know we'll need some form elements
20:28 - we'll need some
20:30 - um
20:32 - the word just slipped my mind when you
20:34 - check
20:35 - form validation that's it so we need
20:37 - some form validation
20:40 - um
20:42 - let's see
20:44 - okay they're not happy with the font
20:46 - size so they think the font size is too
20:48 - large
20:50 - so um
20:53 - we'll see we'll see
20:55 - i'm i'm more likely i like to have a
20:58 - larger font for readability uh so
21:01 - i'll have to let you know how that goes
21:03 - um
21:06 - that will be hard to change though
21:11 - and uh good news is that resource page
21:14 - that we spent so much time building they
21:16 - love the resource page and they thanked
21:19 - us they thanked me for all the hard work
21:21 - but i know that you all did a lot of the
21:23 - work too so i'm going to extend that
21:25 - thanks to you all
21:27 - for that
21:29 - and we may end up adding an entirely new
21:31 - page to the site
21:33 - that would be a place to submit advice
21:36 - and then also have that advice displayed
21:39 - for everyone so
21:41 - that's a possibility uh that's listed as
21:44 - something that would come in the future
21:45 - that we might not have to work on um you
21:48 - know this month or even next month so
21:51 - uh i'm gonna check the live chat see if
21:53 - there's any questions about some of the
21:55 - updates that i just talked about before
21:57 - i move on
22:00 - and uh let me know too if you if you'd
22:03 - like to see like something else on the
22:04 - screen besides me i can switch back to
22:06 - the view where you see the code uh i
22:08 - don't have a lot of code to show you
22:10 - right now but
22:12 - um i'm happy to switch it if you uh if
22:16 - you like
22:19 - okay
22:22 - okay uh
22:24 - the wall says uh so are your past
22:27 - projects on mirn stack
22:30 - um
22:34 - what is that so mirn is what like exp
22:37 - help me out on mern i can't remember
22:38 - what the m is
22:40 - is the m [ __ ]
22:46 - is it [ __ ] x
22:50 - express reacts
22:53 - nginx
22:56 - okay so them is [ __ ]
22:57 - well yeah well we're somewhat on the
23:00 - mern stack we haven't really used [ __ ]
23:02 - uh very much
23:04 - did we use i think one of the projects
23:06 - that we haven't launched yet uses [ __ ]
23:08 - uh that bulletin project we got some
23:11 - updates for that too so we'll get to
23:13 - that
23:14 - i hope i don't forget because those are
23:15 - really exciting
23:18 - but basically all our projects we've
23:20 - used react
23:21 - if we need to do stuff like custom
23:23 - server stuff we're also doing some some
23:26 - things with
23:27 - with express obviously node
23:31 - we've used
23:33 - yeah so we have the urn of the mirn
23:36 - stack we have the ern
23:38 - um
23:41 - that's uh that's who yeah so thank
23:43 - thanks for the
23:44 - in the live chat thank you for uh
23:46 - letting me know what what the everything
23:48 - in mirn was so i had i had some of it
23:50 - right i forgot about the manga
23:52 - um
23:55 - yeah so basically we have everything
23:57 - except the [ __ ]
24:01 - all right let's
24:02 - see all right a lot of people saying
24:05 - hello there's somebody from birmingham
24:07 - uh uk
24:08 - there's a birmingham in the united
24:10 - states too so
24:11 - make sure you want to specify
24:14 - from romania but living in birmingham
24:15 - awesome
24:16 - albania
24:20 - cool um
24:23 - oh there's a new react update so john
24:25 - hanson mentioned react update 16.2
24:28 - no more div around divs or using an
24:32 - array of components with named keys and
24:34 - commas
24:35 - uh react fragment is here awesome i'll
24:38 - have to check that out
24:39 - maybe um if if possible i'll try to use
24:42 - that feature in an upcoming stream i
24:44 - think that'd be really cool to you know
24:46 - try it out live as soon as we can
24:48 - um
24:50 - cool jordan says hey from ann arbor
24:52 - michigan
24:53 - awesome
24:56 - um
24:57 - all right
24:58 - let me move on to i think the most
25:01 - exciting things that we're going to work
25:03 - on
25:04 - so
25:05 - let me let me set up this scenario for
25:07 - you all
25:08 - to ex so that you all know why i think
25:11 - we should do this
25:13 - so as some of you may know recall
25:16 - i try my best to not complain on the
25:19 - stream but you may have heard me
25:21 - complain about
25:23 - the amount of
25:28 - support i have to provide for things
25:30 - like the bulletin or the resource center
25:33 - for the bulletin in particular the login
25:36 - process
25:37 - people just um almost always the problem
25:40 - is old browsers
25:42 - but occasionally there's some weird
25:44 - things with emails not being sent
25:46 - uh it's not really from our end the
25:48 - emails do get sent from ion they just
25:50 - don't get picked up by
25:52 - they get blocked basically
25:55 - i don't even want to say block because i
25:56 - don't even get a message that they're
25:57 - blocked they just get lost somewhere
25:59 - along the way i don't know why but
26:00 - anyway
26:02 - we have that problem and then in the
26:04 - resource center we have the problem with
26:06 - older browsers not accepting the forms
26:08 - being submitted so right now we have a
26:10 - disclaimer on our one of our forms
26:13 - that it does not work with older
26:15 - browsers
26:16 - but i think
26:19 - i figured out a way where we can just
26:20 - totally avoid all of that browser
26:23 - compatibility stuff
26:25 - and i was inspired to do this uh when i
26:28 - was talking
26:29 - uh with
26:31 - um
26:32 - shelly from github i cannot remember her
26:34 - last name so sorry um but shelly from
26:37 - github who is a speaker at november
26:39 - works on the electron team
26:43 - so if you're not familiar with electron
26:45 - it's a way to build um
26:47 - desktop apps
26:49 - for
26:50 - windows and
26:52 - mac
26:53 - i think also
26:55 - also linux i'm pretty sure that it works
26:57 - for linux too
26:59 - but you can build that
27:01 - in javascript html and css and it will
27:04 - run
27:05 - or as a desktop app so some examples of
27:08 - this are atom
27:10 - visual studio code
27:11 - slack
27:13 - maybe spotify i can't remember a spotify
27:16 - the desktop app runs on that or not but
27:18 - for sure the first three that i said
27:21 - so i think we should make the bulletin
27:25 - and
27:27 - the um
27:29 - the resource center
27:31 - desktop
27:33 - apps and mobile apps
27:37 - so we're going to be using react native
27:38 - for mobile
27:39 - and then
27:41 - is there a name for making electron apps
27:43 - with react does it have a special name
27:45 - or are we just
27:46 - is it just called electron and we'll
27:48 - just use react i don't know if there's a
27:50 - special name let me know
27:52 - um
27:54 - but i think that'll be so cool because
27:55 - we've never done anything with electron
27:57 - before
27:58 - and we've just kind of briefly looked at
28:01 - one of my projects
28:03 - that i did with
28:05 - um react native
28:08 - but i was just kind of showing you all
28:10 - how
28:10 - you know kind of the final result we
28:12 - didn't really work on it together
28:16 - so
28:17 - these are going to be like side projects
28:19 - that we'll do in parallel so i'll create
28:20 - repos for them
28:22 - i'll set up like the boilerplate so i'll
28:25 - use create react native app
28:28 - and get it started just to set up the
28:29 - repo and then i'm going to need to do my
28:31 - research on electron because i've never
28:33 - done anything with electron so whatever
28:35 - is the easiest way to just get something
28:37 - started we'll do that and then the
28:39 - process will simply be taking what we
28:41 - already have for those projects so the
28:44 - um resource center is already live and
28:46 - it's at a completed stage
28:48 - we'll we'll port those over
28:51 - uh to react native and to electron and
28:54 - then
28:55 - for the
28:56 - bulletin
28:58 - there's a little bit more we have to do
29:00 - for the bulletin to get it to a
29:01 - completed stage but we'll also
29:05 - have repos open for those
29:07 - so that when i have time i'll work on it
29:09 - when i can
29:11 - but as as you all
29:13 - may know
29:14 - my number one priority now is that main
29:16 - website that we're working on at project
29:18 - five
29:19 - so
29:20 - as i can i'll work on them but
29:23 - if any of you are really interested in
29:25 - learning more about
29:26 - react native or electron and you're
29:29 - you're kind of looking for a project
29:31 - then
29:32 - uh you know go ahead with this i'll try
29:34 - to do my best to keep up with pull
29:35 - requests and open up issues
29:38 - but the cool thing is is you all already
29:41 - know exactly what's expected from this
29:43 - because you can just check out what
29:44 - we've done on the just normal react
29:47 - versions of both of these
29:49 - uh so
29:52 - yeah so and these are some things that
29:54 - they don't need to be done there's no
29:55 - due date on these this is just kind of
29:57 - my idea i ran it by my boss this morning
30:00 - and he thought it was a great idea so
30:03 - you know i i we're gonna do them and
30:06 - it'll happen sometime but there's no due
30:08 - date on these so
30:11 - uh we'll just work when we can
30:13 - i think
30:16 - i think that's all
30:18 - uh the only other thing that i want
30:20 - everybody to still keep in mind
30:22 - is i'm looking for a good javascript cms
30:27 - that is as easy
30:29 - for a user to work with as wordpress in
30:32 - terms of being able to
30:34 - upload um data what i don't want is i
30:38 - know there are some cms's out there that
30:41 - are like you you pay for like monthly i
30:43 - don't want something like that i want
30:44 - something that is preferably entirely
30:47 - open source and can be self-hosted just
30:49 - like you know wordpress can be
30:51 - self-hosted
30:53 - but i'd love for it to be javascript so
30:54 - we don't have to mess with any php
30:57 - i mean obviously it needs to be very
30:59 - easily
31:00 - you know compatible with graphql
31:03 - netlify has a cms that i haven't looked
31:06 - into at all i just heard about
31:08 - uh i don't think that it will work for
31:11 - our use case
31:12 - but
31:14 - you know we we don't need to decide on
31:16 - that yet so i'm still kind of testing
31:17 - things out if we need to to get some
31:20 - data just to test things we'll use
31:22 - wordpress with graphql
31:24 - and that'll be fine because we could
31:26 - always plug in a different source of
31:27 - data later on
31:30 - all right
31:31 - i think that's
31:32 - all that i had in terms of
31:36 - new announcements if i think of
31:38 - something
31:39 - i i'll let you know
31:43 - um but
31:45 - i will
31:46 - um
31:48 - so hey
31:49 - i just got all these messages uh so just
31:52 - distracting me for a second
32:00 - um the really cool thing about the
32:02 - november conference as well is i made so
32:04 - many uh met so many new people and then
32:08 - the fact that you can just add people on
32:10 - twitter right away is great because
32:12 - then i can contact i love that we're not
32:14 - like exchanging business cards anymore
32:17 - right like
32:18 - it's just like okay what's your what's
32:20 - your twitter name
32:22 - you know right there
32:23 - and um
32:25 - now we can you know communicate like
32:27 - that
32:31 - anyway
32:33 - let me check the live chat quickly
32:34 - before we move on to something so i can
32:36 - answer any questions
32:42 - um
32:43 - street fighter says jess has the coffee
32:46 - gotten any better with age no
32:48 - it says if not i suggest instant coffee
32:50 - sticks i recommend them personally they
32:52 - are amazing
32:54 - an instant coffee stick would be an
32:56 - improvement on what i have right now
32:58 - um it definitely keeps me awake just
33:00 - from like the flavor in my mouth it's
33:02 - just
33:03 - awful
33:05 - i don't know why i keep drinking it i
33:06 - need to put it far away from me so i
33:08 - don't drink it anymore
33:11 - um
33:14 - let's see okay so um electron does work
33:17 - on all platforms thanks
33:19 - uh so
33:21 - angel
33:23 - do you pronounce your name angel or
33:27 - some other i mean because you're from
33:28 - dominican republic so i'm assuming
33:30 - that's not how you pronounce it let me
33:32 - know how you pronounce it i'm not going
33:33 - to try to guess and mess it up i want to
33:35 - know how you pronounce it so i can i can
33:37 - get it right
33:39 - uh world boss asks if i'm a freelancer
33:42 - um
33:43 - i am not a freelancer i was a freelancer
33:45 - for three years
33:47 - uh but now i am uh
33:50 - employed full-time as a front-end
33:52 - developer
33:54 - i do some freelance work on the side
33:56 - still i'm currently not i sh well i take
33:58 - that back i'm currently doing like very
34:00 - minimal freelance work i have someone
34:02 - who's um
34:04 - like a friend of the family
34:06 - and i keep their wordpress blog up to
34:08 - date uh i upload some post form twice a
34:11 - month and uh twice a month i go and
34:13 - update plugins
34:16 - so it's really minimal i mean
34:18 - literally i make 15 a month off of them
34:21 - it's like
34:23 - super minimal
34:24 - um it's insane because
34:27 - i spend like way less than an hour a
34:29 - month
34:30 - uh on that site and i gave them a very
34:33 - good price because uh because of
34:36 - the connection the family connection
34:39 - uh anyway i am interested in doing
34:41 - freelance work so i don't want to be
34:43 - always doing something because it's hard
34:45 - on my family but
34:47 - if anybody ever has any projects and you
34:49 - know you'd like some help with them
34:52 - uh i'm open to that
34:54 - i'm really picky about what projects i
34:56 - do so i'm not going to guarantee that i
34:58 - will say yes to doing that but
35:00 - i i do like if it's a technology that
35:03 - i'm interested in that sounds fun
35:05 - then
35:06 - and and potentially if the if the price
35:09 - is right as well uh then i'm i'm
35:11 - definitely interested in
35:13 - in doing that
35:14 - um
35:15 - let's see
35:16 - of a few other questions
35:19 - john hanson says uh jesse i wonder if
35:23 - some of the email delivery issue comes
35:25 - from
35:27 - dkim and spf pass in the header of the
35:30 - message this is a server-side setting it
35:32 - needs to be in place from the web
35:34 - hosting servers
35:36 - all right
35:37 - i honestly have i i don't know anything
35:40 - about um those issues i've never heard
35:43 - about that before um so you may be right
35:47 - but
35:48 - i don't even know how to check that
35:50 - so
35:52 - so anyway john if
35:54 - you have more info about that can give
35:56 - me some more direction i can try to
35:57 - check into it i assume that it was a
36:00 - problem with the university's email
36:02 - servers
36:03 - since
36:04 - basically i can trace it through
36:06 - sendgrid and sendgrid says that it's
36:08 - delivered
36:10 - um
36:12 - but they still don't see it and i know
36:14 - other people have had similar issues
36:16 - with other things other than sendgrid
36:19 - um i'm hoping so at the end of the month
36:22 - we're going to switch over to use
36:24 - instead of group wise we're gonna use
36:27 - outlook
36:28 - i was hoping that with that switch it
36:29 - might help things that's why i haven't
36:32 - really been like digging too far into it
36:34 - because i thought it may end up being a
36:36 - waste
36:38 - but i'm i i don't know that much about
36:42 - email servers and things like that so
36:44 - i'm definitely open to any advice you
36:45 - all have
36:55 - okay so the spanish pronunciation of
36:58 - angels different
36:59 - um
37:01 - so what would you say so is it like
37:03 - angel or something like that i don't
37:06 - know
37:07 - all right you know what
37:08 - let's look this up right now
37:20 - all right so
37:26 - i got it
37:28 - oh man this is killing me i have to
37:30 - watch a commercial to watch a five
37:32 - second video on how to pronounce it
37:55 - according to youtube that's it all right
37:57 - and that's cool okay so on on hill says
38:00 - yes that's good all right
38:02 - awesome i think it's important to do my
38:05 - best to pronounce uh your names
38:08 - correctly so
38:10 - anyway
38:12 - um
38:15 - all right
38:23 - uh brett says possibly starting a job
38:26 - right next to blue bottle coffee in
38:27 - oakland california have you tried blue
38:29 - bottle i have not tried a blue bottle
38:33 - um
38:37 - is it really good i'm not sure if i can
38:39 - get blue bottle coffee out here in
38:42 - eastern ohio
38:44 - oh cool street fighter says shelley from
38:46 - github is an amazing person i've never
38:48 - met her but i've listened to people who
38:50 - have
38:51 - um yeah like i only talked with her uh
38:54 - we were both um
38:56 - in the
38:58 - speaker's lounge

39:11 - yeah she seemed really amazing i mean
39:14 - and she's not even out of college yet
39:16 - and she's already working for github and
39:18 - and doing cool work with electron a lot
39:21 - of c-plus plus work

40:09 - the bat when we were looking at this um
40:12 - where are we at it's more chromes
40:15 - franciscan react
40:18 - yeah this is it franciscan reacts
40:23 - okay
40:25 - so
40:26 - this this repo so the uh it is in the
40:28 - fus marcom organization and then the
40:31 - franciscan react site so we have
40:34 - branches right now so we have a gatsby
40:37 - branch and we have our master branch we
40:39 - also had a next branch but that was
40:41 - merged into master and it's no longer
40:43 - being updated
40:44 - um so the master right now is next
40:47 - and then we have that gatsby branch what
40:49 - i'd like to do is
40:51 - uh puts
40:53 - basically i want to pull in data into
40:54 - the master so that we can run a test of
40:58 - being able to pull in data from graphql
41:00 - from
41:02 - probably wordpress
41:05 - server side rendering that and then
41:06 - serving that
41:08 - and then doing the same thing with
41:10 - gatsby but instead of server-side
41:11 - rendering it will build a static site
41:14 - um and then push that to the client
41:17 - so i'd like to get them to the same
41:19 - point with just like minimal ui
41:22 - and bringing in the same data and then
41:24 - just do some testing on it to see like
41:27 - which one's easier to deploy and work
41:29 - with
41:31 - which one
41:32 - is faster uh i think it would be cool i
41:36 - know there's articles and people have
41:38 - already done stuff like this but i think
41:39 - it would be really cool to do it live on
41:41 - the stream
41:43 - uh
41:45 - i don't know i think there's value in
41:46 - that if you guys uh if you all think
41:49 - that
41:50 - that's kind of a waste of time let me
41:52 - know but
41:54 - uh sometimes it's just cool to you know
41:56 - try it and
41:58 - see the results being able to like tweak
42:01 - things on our own you know and and see
42:03 - how it changes uh the the load times and
42:06 - things
42:08 - uh also you know being able to see like
42:10 - what's the size
42:12 - of the the files that get sent to the
42:14 - client you know will one give us
42:17 - you know less that needs to be sent
42:20 - because that's you know ideal
42:23 - um anyway so that's the plan
42:28 - and while i'm in here on github i'll
42:29 - just so that we're clear on the other
42:31 - things
42:32 - um
42:34 - let me make this biggest this one okay
42:36 - so
42:37 - we're gonna do
42:40 - this resource center here
42:42 - the resource center repo we're going to
42:44 - make another repo that'll probably be
42:47 - resource center
42:49 - uh react native and then we'll have a
42:51 - resource center electron
42:54 - and we'll build it out react native
42:55 - build it out an electron
42:57 - i do want to make sure when we build out
42:59 - with react native we use the proper
43:01 - components so that it will work on ios
43:04 - and android if you've never used react
43:06 - native that might be confusing but there
43:08 - are some components that only work on
43:11 - android
43:12 - so we don't want to use those if we do
43:15 - use those we definitely want to have a
43:16 - check first like a ternary and if
43:19 - statement saying you know if it's not
43:21 - ios then use this
43:24 - so
43:24 - i'm okay with that as long as we account
43:27 - for that so
43:28 - um
43:30 - i mean i'll talk about it more when we
43:32 - actually make those repos and everything
43:34 - but
43:34 - uh just keep that in mind and then on
43:37 - this bulletin react which isn't finished
43:39 - yet we're going to also have an electron
43:42 - version of this that'll be a separate
43:43 - repo and a react native version that'll
43:45 - be a separate repo and again if you
43:47 - weren't here uh when i discussed this
43:49 - the reason behind this is that i'm
43:51 - having a lot of trouble with people with
43:53 - really old browsers trying to view this
43:56 - and uh it's it's causing me a lot of
43:59 - time
44:00 - to have to uh handle
44:03 - that kind of thing
44:05 - and it's so i
44:06 - usually the complaint comes in to
44:08 - someone else in my department they have
44:10 - to handle it then i have to handle it
44:12 - and then what i usually have to do is go
44:15 - over check it out because often at times
44:17 - they don't know what browser they have
44:19 - and then i don't have the um
44:23 - the access to be able to update their
44:24 - browser i need an admin password for
44:26 - that and i don't have like kind of the
44:29 - universal admin password so then i have
44:31 - to get in contact with somebody from the
44:33 - i t department
44:34 - and then hope that they get over there
44:37 - and upgrade everything correctly
44:39 - so
44:41 - you can see it
44:42 - for each time that happens it takes a
44:44 - lot of time out so the solution i'm i'm
44:47 - thinking is
44:50 - have electron which if they're using
44:52 - electron
44:54 - right
44:55 - then they're automatically getting a
44:57 - version of of chrome a version of
44:59 - chromium um
45:01 - that
45:02 - will work
45:04 - so they won't realize it but they're
45:06 - essentially downloading the browser that
45:08 - they need to run it properly
45:11 - so
45:12 - i and i believe i need to test this out
45:17 - on windows but on a mac
45:19 - even if you don't have an admin password
45:21 - you can still download electron apps and
45:23 - they work
45:24 - so i have done that before
45:27 - um
45:28 - on a mac that i didn't have an admin
45:29 - password for so assuming that it also
45:32 - works with
45:34 - windows then that would be really great
45:37 - so
45:38 - anyway
45:39 - uh also i think it'll just be really
45:41 - cool and a great experience for for me
45:43 - and for all of you
45:45 - to be able to build ios app an android
45:47 - app and a desktop app that will work
45:50 - cross-platform
45:52 - to build all that together i think it'll
45:54 - be some great skills uh that
45:57 - can be in in your portfolio uh and some
46:00 - great skills you know be able to take
46:02 - like our starting point and then you all
46:05 - can use that and modify it to make your
46:07 - own apps or your own
46:09 - uh you know desktop apps with electron
46:14 - i just i think it'd be really fun
46:22 - okay john hanson uh talking again about
46:25 - the email thing says once you look up
46:27 - these two items dkim and spf and get
46:31 - them set it can mean a difference of
46:33 - mail taking hours days not at all versus
46:36 - the mail going through in seconds
46:37 - contact the web hosting service
46:40 - okay cool i'll have to i'll probably
46:43 - have to talk to the it department then
46:48 - i'll look it up though because i'm not
46:51 - i'm still not 100 sure whether that'd be
46:53 - something on the email sending or the
46:56 - receiving side
46:57 - uh so
47:00 - i will have to um look that up i'm still
47:03 - hopeful that maybe it'll be fixed when
47:05 - we switch to outlook
47:11 - okay cool angel says i think if we have
47:13 - time to do all that uh
47:16 - that test the performance it'll be good
47:18 - and we will learn more on the run yeah
47:20 - you know what
47:21 - that's a good point if we have time to
47:23 - do that if you remember we still need to
47:25 - have this done by
47:26 - mid-february preferably early february
47:30 - so we can have more time for testing and
47:31 - this thing needs to launch by the end of
47:33 - february
47:34 - so you're right we need to keep that in
47:36 - mind
47:38 - so
47:39 - this testing needs to happen soon
47:42 - like
47:43 - let's try to get
47:44 - both of the branches to the point where
47:46 - we can get a decent test
47:48 - within the next week
47:50 - and then we'll make our decision and
47:52 - there's no more second guessing and it's
47:54 - me that's doing all the second guessing
47:56 - so
47:57 - i'm gonna promise to no more second
47:59 - guessing whatever we pick at that point
48:00 - we're gonna stick with it
48:02 - and we're not gonna switch at least not
48:04 - for months and months so
48:07 - that'll be the goal before the end of
48:09 - next week we'll make a final decision
48:12 - based on our testing
48:18 - matt robinson didn't know you were going
48:19 - to be in my neck of the woods oh so or
48:21 - matt are you um from around nashville
48:24 - then
48:26 - if so yeah i wish i wish um
48:29 - we could have connected i actually had
48:30 - very little time the one thing about
48:32 - november that was good or bad depending
48:34 - on how you look at it is it was
48:37 - just packed with stuff
48:39 - uh breakfast for the conference started
48:41 - at 8 am
48:42 - and then the keynotes were over at 6 00
48:44 - pm and then after that every single
48:47 - night there was some type of event
48:51 - so
48:51 - you know really you could go from 8 a.m
48:54 - to 8 p.m or later
48:56 - pretty much every day of the conference
48:58 - so
49:00 - it was packed with stuff i had hoped to
49:02 - get some pull requests merged and things
49:03 - at the conference but i i had no time
49:06 - when i did have any time i was like
49:08 - taking a nap because
49:10 - um
49:11 - it was it was exhausting but good it was
49:13 - it was good exhausting
49:18 - all right
49:20 - let's see i am on time 250.
49:25 - let's see
49:27 - okay
49:29 - so i think that's all i wanted to say in
49:32 - terms of updates
49:37 - just checking briefly
49:44 - yeah
49:45 - that's it in terms of the update so we
49:47 - got a lot of stuff uh kind of planned
49:49 - out
49:50 - and
49:51 - i guess we could
49:55 - i tell you what
49:59 - we still have we've only we've been
50:01 - streaming for less than an hour so i
50:02 - usually go longer than this
50:04 - let's do one pomodoro cycle of setting
50:07 - up the react native repo for
50:10 - let's say
50:12 - let's do one for the resource center
50:14 - since the resource center's already
50:15 - finished so i'm going to go through the
50:17 - setup process we're going to use create
50:19 - react native app
50:20 - and then we'll set up the repo and then
50:22 - that way we'll have at least one of the
50:24 - repos that we need to set up so one out
50:27 - of the four new ones that we're going to
50:29 - have
50:31 - uh i don't think we've yeah we've
50:33 - definitely not done this on a stream
50:35 - so if you've never used react native
50:38 - before hopefully this will be beneficial
50:40 - to you
50:41 - and
50:43 - where's my pomodoro
50:48 - i have it somewhere all right let's use
50:50 - this pomodoro clock
50:52 - and
50:55 - let me pull over my
51:00 - my terminal
51:07 - okay
51:11 - let me make this big enough so that you
51:13 - all can see it
51:16 - okay so first thing i'm going to do is
51:19 - cd in my into my projects folder
51:24 - and
51:27 - so
51:28 - here's what i'm gonna do
51:31 - i will be going to the create react
51:34 - native app
51:36 - github page
51:43 - and following the instructions for that
51:52 - and you all can follow along if you want
51:53 - if you just search for create react
51:55 - native app
51:56 - for me on google the very first uh
52:00 - result that came up was the github page
52:05 - so
52:06 - we're going to install that globally
52:11 - here i'm just going to copy over what's
52:13 - on there just to save time
52:16 - so
52:21 - let's install
52:34 - is that is it over already that was like
52:36 - super fast
52:43 - amazing all right cool um
52:47 - all right so i'm in the projects folder
52:48 - and i'm going to say create react native
52:50 - app and then we're going to give it a
52:51 - name so this is our resource center so
52:53 - let's call it
52:57 - our
53:02 - i'm gonna call it rc
53:09 - rc native
53:15 - i read somewhere that there was some
53:17 - weird issue where you can't use
53:19 - camelcase or hyphens i can't remember
53:22 - exactly what the issue was but that's
53:24 - why i'm going to make it like this which
53:25 - is a little weird
53:27 - but just so that we don't run into that
53:28 - issue that's that's why i'm doing this
53:31 - every time i've ever used this which was
53:33 - once
53:34 - i just had one word and it was all
53:36 - lowercase so i've never dealt with that
53:38 - issue
53:44 - so what this is going to do is uh give
53:47 - us kind of a starting point
53:49 - for react native app
53:53 - and
53:54 - when it goes when it's all done we'll
53:56 - have a new folder named rc native
54:00 - that we'll be able to go into and we
54:02 - should be able to see
54:04 - basically it'll be a
54:06 - working app
54:16 - let's see while it's going through its
54:17 - thing i'm going to check the live chat
54:28 - john hanson says does this mean i'm
54:30 - personally soon going to be building a
54:32 - react native app i'm just getting used
54:34 - to create react app blaming all of it on
54:36 - you
54:37 - jk
54:38 - yeah yeah
54:41 - we're gonna do react native
54:43 - um
54:45 - don't worry if you are intimidated
54:47 - that's exactly how i felt before i made
54:50 - my first one it's so much easier than
54:53 - than you might think
54:55 - all right so yarn starts
54:59 - and the expo
55:07 - all right so let's cd
55:08 - rc native which it gives you nice
55:10 - instructions right there
55:12 - uh and then let's let's yarn start
55:14 - i don't know if i have everything i need
55:17 - on this computer i do have my laptop
55:22 - i thought i downloaded everything i need
55:24 - we'll see
55:27 - i do have
55:29 - so on your phones
55:31 - you
55:32 - will need to download if you want to
55:33 - work on this an app called expo that's
55:36 - e-x-p-o
55:38 - so you can see you're talking about expo
55:40 - here and that'll allow you to preview
55:43 - what's going on directly on your phone
55:45 - uh which is awesome
55:48 - and uh so
55:50 - i'm gonna go
55:52 - uh here in my search bar
55:54 - and and and expo now
55:57 - i could potentially um
56:00 - i'm trying to think if this always runs
56:04 - i don't remember if this always runs
56:06 - over wi-fi or if you can plug in your
56:08 - phone and have it run like that but this
56:10 - should work as long as i'm on the same
56:12 - network
56:14 - which
56:15 - let me double check that i am on the
56:17 - same network
56:20 - i am cool
56:21 - um
56:22 - let's see let me open up expo
56:26 - and
56:26 - maybe i'll uh make my screen bigger just
56:28 - to show you all you can also use um the
56:32 - emulator so let me open up the
56:34 - ios emulator
56:39 - so you can see it there
56:48 - oh i could just scan the qr code what am
56:50 - i thinking similar because of a problem
56:54 - all right so it looks like i could not
56:56 - open it
57:01 - q let me display that qr code again
57:10 - it's way too big i need to make this
57:12 - smaller so i can
57:16 - see it oh okay cool it worked now
57:19 - um yeah so let me make my screen
57:22 - my camera bigger so you can see some of
57:24 - this
57:26 - it's all right i'll let you see it when
57:28 - it actually gets finished
57:31 - it does take a minute
57:40 - oh shoot
57:42 - what happened
57:43 - sorry
57:44 - try to scan this again
57:46 - all right almost done now
57:50 - if i was thinking properly i would have
57:52 - put up i would have used visors you can
57:54 - see this on the screen but i wasn't
57:55 - planning on doing this
57:57 - oh what the heck happened
58:01 - dismissed
58:10 - come on
58:22 - if you shake it
58:24 - you can reload
58:26 - so you can see i shook it and hit reload
58:30 - hmm
58:31 - unidentified is not an object evaluating
58:34 - native version major
58:36 - all right i'm not exactly sure
58:42 - um
58:45 - i'm not sure what the problem is i'm
58:47 - currently getting an error message and
58:49 - the glares you probably can't see
58:50 - because of the glare
58:53 - so that's odd i've never gotten an error
58:55 - message right away
58:57 - what i do want to do though
58:59 - is
59:02 - duplicate this tab quickly and then
59:06 - open up atom just to show you the file
59:08 - structure
59:18 - all right
59:19 - um see we have all our
59:23 - node modules which is always
59:25 - a lot
59:27 - um let's see our app.js
59:33 - there we go
59:34 - okay so check this out
59:36 - this looks almost exactly like the
59:39 - regular react uh that we're used to
59:42 - using uh i'm still on me sorry
59:45 - there we go check this out now
59:48 - um
59:49 - look at this we're importing react from
59:51 - react and then we're importing a couple
59:53 - of components from react native right
59:56 - export default class right this is all
59:59 - familiar
60:00 - and then we're rendering
60:02 - return we have a view
60:04 - which
60:05 - when you see view and react native think
60:07 - div
60:08 - okay and then when you see text
60:10 - instead of p tags
60:12 - or even h tags
60:14 - we have our text tags
60:17 - so
60:18 - and look at our style sheet so we have
60:20 - our styles here we're using flexbox we
60:23 - have a background color right so without
60:25 - i know i can't get this to show up but
60:27 - we already know exactly what this is
60:29 - going to look like
60:31 - right
60:31 - we have our container that's going to
60:33 - have a white background we're using flex
60:36 - all right it's going to take up the full
60:37 - screen we're going to center it
60:40 - so the items will be centered both
60:41 - vertically and horizontally and all
60:43 - we're going to have are three lines of
60:45 - text and it's going to say this
60:47 - right just like we have in there
60:49 - so so easy
60:52 - we could check out our package json and
60:54 - see
60:55 - it's just simple now of course this is
60:57 - the create react native app right if we
60:59 - ejected
61:01 - it would be way more
61:03 - complicated but for now
61:05 - this is what we have
61:09 - we run start
61:11 - when we're um
61:13 - when we're in development mode
61:15 - and i believe
61:17 - if we want to make an android app we
61:20 - type android and it creates all the
61:22 - files we need
61:23 - and then
61:24 - if we want to do with ios it says
61:27 - we just type ios so npm start ios or
61:32 - or i'm sorry npm run ios or we could
61:34 - just do yarn ios
61:36 - um
61:39 - yeah super easy
61:42 - and that's it and this is
61:44 - i i still i have no idea what the issue
61:47 - is with the um
61:50 - with the error that i'm getting
61:56 - but
61:59 - maybe i'll just
62:01 - i'll try one more time to restart this
62:03 - and then if it still doesn't work
62:06 - then
62:07 - i'm not going to try it again
62:29 - alright so in the live chat
62:33 - oh blake got in here late it's cool
62:34 - blake
62:35 - um
62:39 - no actually blake this is an electron
62:41 - right now this is react native
62:43 - so we will be working with electron in
62:45 - the future uh but right now i was trying
62:48 - to set up react native
62:50 - but i keep getting an error saying
62:51 - undefined is not an object
62:54 - evaluating native version major dot
62:57 - major and node modules
63:05 - oh man
63:07 - yeah um don't know why this is not
63:10 - working
63:12 - see you might have been getting started
63:28 - hmm
63:36 - that's my npm version
63:51 - okay i have the the right version that
63:54 - should work
63:55 - um let's see
64:06 - i did
64:08 - let me double check i did check on the
64:10 - network so on hill says
64:13 - check the network
64:19 - yeah it is the the correct network
64:29 - hmm
64:31 - let me um
64:38 - it's already up to date okay
65:03 - all right let me
65:05 - i just totally turned off um
65:10 - that
65:11 - instance of the app that i was trying to
65:12 - run an expo and now i restarted the
65:15 - server and now i'm going to try
65:18 - to open it again
65:19 - and see if
65:22 - something happened maybe i'm like gonna
65:23 - flush out
65:24 - yay it worked awesome okay
65:28 - i don't know what happened at first but
65:29 - once i
65:31 - i turned it off and turned it back on
65:32 - and then that fixed it so
65:34 - um let me show you i know it's going to
65:37 - be hard to see
65:39 - and like again i'm sorry i didn't set it
65:40 - up so i could show it on my screen
65:42 - um
65:44 - but here's our
65:46 - uh trying to get out of the glare you
65:48 - can probably maybe barely see it
65:51 - depending on what your screen resolution
65:53 - is but there's the text
65:55 - that we had
65:56 - um
65:58 - open up app it's all backwards for me
66:01 - who's trying to look at it
66:02 - uh open up app.js to start working on
66:06 - your app
66:07 - so there we go
66:08 - so
66:09 - essentially in just a few minutes it
66:12 - would have been shorter if i would have
66:13 - just restarted it right off the bat
66:15 - um
66:16 - and got it working
66:19 - but in just a few minutes
66:21 - we actually have an android app that
66:23 - works now we didn't bundle this all in
66:25 - the correct file format or anything like
66:27 - that so
66:29 - i mean i guess technically it's not
66:31 - exactly like an android app
66:34 - but you know we have it running
66:37 - via expo
66:39 - uh on an android phone right now and if
66:42 - i had an ios
66:44 - device it would i could do the same
66:46 - thing
66:50 - so
66:50 - last thing i want to do which i think i
66:52 - still have time yeah we have about nine
66:54 - minutes left in this pomodoro session so
66:57 - what i'd like to do now
66:58 - is
67:00 - make a github repo for this just bare
67:03 - minimum github repo i'm just going to
67:05 - change just a bit
67:07 - and let's say
67:22 - i don't want to say mobile app i'm going
67:23 - to say react native
67:36 - oh my typing is terrible today
67:39 - okay
67:42 - remove these
67:44 - and save that
67:46 - and
67:47 - now we're going to make a get repo out
67:49 - of this and then push that up it'll be
67:51 - in there obviously there's like so much
67:53 - we want to do this is the bare minimum
67:55 - of
67:58 - of apps that we could make right now
68:01 - oh no
68:03 - i didn't have my screen on
68:05 - i'm i'm really bad at that
68:07 - at having my screen
68:10 - um
68:14 - switch back over so you all can see
68:17 - what i'm doing
68:18 - okay um so
68:21 - what we need to do first is a git init
68:25 - all right so we are in the folder right
68:28 - our project folder we're going to do a
68:29 - get init
68:32 - um
68:34 - let's see
68:36 - yeah
68:40 - okay great
68:42 - um
68:43 - git commit
68:47 - uh let me make sure i have a um
68:50 - a get ignore file yes i do awesome
68:54 - i thought it came automatically but
68:56 - i just wanted to be sure
68:58 - so we're going to git commit
69:07 - and it's
69:10 - uh get
69:12 - in it and
69:15 - so i
69:16 - commit
69:18 - a um
69:32 - there we go
69:33 - so after my silliness there i had to add
69:36 - the files first before i could commit
69:38 - them obviously
69:40 - um
69:41 - sorry about that
69:42 - okay now we have our repository let's go
69:45 - ahead and create a repository in github
69:47 - and then link the two up and then we can
69:49 - push what we have so far up to github
69:52 - and then now if anybody wants to take a
69:53 - look at it or mess with it or anything
69:56 - then then you'll have that
69:59 - let's see
70:00 - github
70:06 - and we're going to
70:08 - create a new repository
70:11 - we're going to do it under the fus
70:13 - marcom organization and we're going to
70:15 - call this rrc native
70:26 - um
70:39 - make that public and i don't want to add
70:42 - anything right now we can add in our
70:44 - license and we already have a git ignore
70:47 - we can add in the readme later actually
70:50 - we already have a readme we'll just have
70:51 - to edit it
70:53 - so let's create
71:00 - okay
71:02 - so now
71:04 - we already have a repository so we're
71:06 - just going to copy
71:09 - each of these lines
71:11 - i never tried copying both the lines at
71:13 - once would that work
71:16 - i guess it would but in this one we're
71:18 - gonna
71:19 - oops
71:20 - you all probably can't see that huh
71:23 - there we go
71:24 - um we're gonna add
71:28 - right this is our like ssh address for a
71:32 - repo so we're gonna add that
71:36 - and then our next one
71:41 - we're going to actually push
71:45 - to the repo that we've just linked to
71:55 - great
71:57 - now
72:00 - we
72:01 - should be able to see
72:04 - that code that we just had
72:06 - yep so here we go um
72:09 - here's our
72:12 - there we go there's our code
72:14 - and there's our text that we edited
72:18 - all right so that's that's ready to go
72:21 - so now we have a repo to work out of
72:23 - like i said earlier i'm not going to be
72:25 - working primarily on this or any of our
72:27 - other electron or native things that
72:29 - we're going to do
72:30 - because that's not that's not a priority
72:33 - right now for me um
72:35 - it's just something that will be helpful
72:38 - and that i really like to work on but
72:41 - i will keep up with the pull requests or
72:43 - at least i'll do my best to keep up with
72:44 - them and i'll bring them up from time to
72:47 - time you know if things change and if we
72:49 - do work on some of these things
72:52 - all right and my cycle yeah the palm
72:54 - door cycle is almost over so i'm going
72:56 - to go back to the live chat i'm going to
72:58 - answer any questions that you all have
73:00 - and
73:01 - after i get to the bottom of the live
73:03 - chat we'll finish up the stream for
73:05 - today
73:20 - oh okay on hill said i could also check
73:22 - out if there uh if there's a new version
73:24 - of expo
73:25 - um that's a good idea
73:27 - i mean we got it to work but that's
73:29 - still a good idea to make sure
73:30 - everything is is up to date
73:42 - uh john hanson says looks easy yeah
73:44 - right yes it looks familiar what is the
73:47 - trigger or logic to call the app to
73:49 - render on a device as opposed to
73:53 - a desktop create react app
73:55 - um
74:00 - it should be it's it's the same so
74:02 - essentially
74:03 - in terms of what's going on in the
74:05 - background i have no idea right i it's
74:09 - and it's working differently depending
74:11 - on if it's ios or android but in terms
74:14 - of you know as a developer what we have
74:17 - to do
74:18 - um the triggering the render works the
74:20 - same way everything is controlled by the
74:22 - state
74:24 - right so you you never
74:26 - um just like in uh normal react you
74:30 - never manipulate manipulate the dom
74:32 - directly it's the same thing here even
74:34 - though we don't even have a dom
74:37 - um
74:38 - you change the state
74:40 - and then things are you know here in the
74:42 - state so just for instance
74:50 - let's just say
75:01 - oops
75:03 - so we could do this and
75:06 - we say
75:10 - i can't believe i'm losing my mind where
75:12 - do i put state up here right
75:16 - um
75:20 - so our state
75:21 - uh is going to be display
75:29 - display text
75:32 - it's false
75:33 - we're going to say it's false right now
75:36 - um oops not that this latex is false
75:41 - and so we would do something like this
75:44 - right
75:45 - um
75:50 - display text
75:55 - where's my
76:01 - hopefully this is
76:02 - answering your question and i'm not like
76:04 - totally missing the point here
76:07 - okay so
76:09 - um
76:10 - if we save that
76:14 - i get i'll get an error can't find oops
76:17 - sorry state
76:19 - this state
76:21 - the display text
76:32 - okay so our state is false and let's see
76:37 - if i can open
76:39 - debug.js remotely
76:43 - let's try to open up this remote
76:45 - debugger
76:50 - and i have no idea where this is gonna
76:52 - open up at
76:56 - i have too many screens open and i can't
76:58 - find the debugger
77:01 - there it is
77:09 - all right so let's inspect
77:12 - and uh let's let's pop this out
77:18 - and make it bigger
77:21 - here's our debugger
77:24 - oh goodness
77:27 - all right let's go to our react
77:30 - oh no do we not even
77:32 - do we not have the react debugger
77:37 - well this is not
77:41 - this is not good why do i not have the
77:42 - react debugger
77:55 - oh well i can't do what i wanted to do
77:57 - all right
78:01 - let's get rid of that we'll just add
78:03 - something this thing
78:05 - all right so let's do
78:12 - is that how it is
78:17 - i think that's what it is in react
78:19 - native um
78:36 - a little touch
78:53 - this set state
78:55 - uh and then we'll just do
78:57 - um display
78:59 - text
79:02 - true
79:05 - so i have to do
79:13 - it's crazy i haven't coded anything for
79:15 - a week and now i'm like forgetting
79:16 - everything
79:18 - um all right let's just save see if i
79:20 - get an error
79:29 - all right not working
79:36 - all right so i'm
79:37 - i'm not gonna uh
79:39 - try to work with this anymore because
79:41 - obviously i'm i'm forgetting too much it
79:43 - has been
79:47 - over a month since i did anything with
79:49 - react native so
79:51 - i'm
79:52 - messing something up but
79:55 - i guess i can just do this
80:00 - just to even see if
80:03 - my code is correct at all there we go um
80:06 - so we can see the state is true
80:10 - um really small there uh so you could
80:13 - probably see that we have two lines you
80:15 - can't really read it but
80:17 - anyway
80:18 - um
80:22 - sorry i just went through all that and i
80:23 - couldn't get it to work i'm guessing
80:25 - that my issue is
80:27 - i i don't know what um
80:30 - what the right handler is here i don't
80:32 - think you can do it on click because
80:34 - you're not clicking but i can't remember
80:36 - what what you're supposed to do
80:48 - and hill says uh you can set up an
80:49 - android simulator on your window or
80:52 - iphone simulator on ios to work with
80:54 - expo yeah so i that's true um so i don't
80:58 - have it set up you can actually set up
81:00 - the android thing on ios 2 but
81:04 - last time i checked it was just more
81:05 - complicated than i wanted to do since i
81:07 - already have an android device it's
81:08 - easier just to run it on there
81:11 - i tried to get the simulator to come up
81:13 - but i got an error so i just didn't
81:16 - really feel like trying to
81:18 - fix it you know on the stream but if we
81:20 - do start working with it a lot on the
81:22 - stream i'll make sure i get the
81:24 - simulator
81:25 - at very least for ios up and running
81:31 - um
81:32 - let's see
81:37 - all right so native w01
81:40 - says jesse have you tried the new
81:43 - version of firefox it's called firefox
81:44 - quantum and it's pretty dang good just
81:46 - made the switch from chromium or from
81:48 - chrome today
81:49 - i have not tried it yet but i've heard
81:52 - really good things about it so um i may
81:54 - have to try that soon
81:57 - um has anyone else used it like i
82:00 - everybody's saying it's super fast
82:05 - i know it says are you going to create
82:06 - some issues i will
82:08 - create some issues
82:10 - uh i'll do my best to create them soon
82:13 - let me think what i have
82:17 - i gotta think about what else i need to
82:19 - do that like needs done right now if so
82:21 - if i have time today maybe i'll try to
82:23 - do some issues otherwise i'll try to get
82:26 - them in there sometime soon
82:35 - blake says i use ssh to pull repo once
82:37 - and every minute it would ask me for my
82:40 - ssh password while
82:42 - i was working on it
82:48 - how
82:58 - i'm trying to think how i set it up
83:00 - you should be able to set it up so that
83:02 - you don't
83:05 - you don't need to
83:07 - it won't ask you for your ssh password
83:11 - actually you know what i do see if this
83:13 - works all right so blake the next time
83:15 - you um use ssh to pull rebo
83:19 - do this
83:20 - and see if it works uh
83:23 - yeah so do ssh
83:26 - add
83:29 - so ssh hyphen add hit enter it'll ask
83:32 - for uh your passphrase
83:36 - and then enter it in there and then you
83:38 - should need to enter it in again
83:41 - i don't have to enter in again until i
83:42 - restart my computer which is
83:44 - infrequently so
83:49 - once you do that
83:51 - as long as you don't restart things
83:53 - then you won't need to put in
83:55 - uh your password again
84:10 - uh alex b says jesse i'm new to free
84:12 - code camp i saw you uh did a lot of
84:14 - videos with multiple technologies can
84:16 - you recommend me a playlist a series to
84:20 - start from
84:22 - um
84:24 - i guess at this point
84:28 - it does depend a little bit about what
84:29 - you're interested in but most of our
84:31 - projects have used react
84:34 - um
84:37 - so
84:38 - it might
84:39 - maybe you want to start with project
84:41 - five day one
84:43 - and because it'd be really easy for you
84:45 - to catch up because we're not that far
84:46 - into the project
84:47 - if you're not worried about catching up
84:49 - with the live stream
84:50 - then
84:52 - i would go with
84:57 - maybe project
85:00 - three or four
85:02 - i'm trying to think what was project
85:04 - three
85:07 - maybe project four then
85:09 - uh
85:10 - because those are kind of simple to get
85:12 - started with we're using create react
85:14 - app
85:16 - to start with one of those i don't
85:18 - recommend starting with project one
85:19 - anymore because
85:21 - it's already kind of out of date we
85:23 - started that months ago they're already
85:25 - we use next they're already new versions
85:27 - of next
85:28 - and we use jquery with
85:32 - um
85:33 - with react which i don't recommend doing
85:35 - so
85:36 - yeah so start with
85:38 - you can start with really any of the
85:40 - projects but i would not recommend
85:42 - starting with project one
85:44 - project five is the best if you want to
85:47 - catch up to the live stream quickly
86:07 - oh okay uh michael is saying you should
86:10 - use touchable opacity and on press
86:13 - okay
86:14 - let's let's try that
86:16 - um
86:29 - let's do that
86:57 - all right cool
86:59 - let me try this
87:05 - kind of chosen
87:21 - oops
87:22 - i might have to put text in
87:32 - for some of the uh buttons in react
87:34 - native you have to put text inside and
87:36 - for some of them you don't
87:38 - i can't remember which ones you do and
87:40 - don't so
87:41 - yep i think that was it
87:43 - great all right cool
87:47 - so let me uh reload this and just show
87:50 - you
87:53 - um
87:54 - let me move my
87:57 - camera
87:58 - okay all right so this is going to be
88:01 - really small so right now i know it's
88:03 - hard to see but
88:04 - if we have our click me button there
88:06 - it's just text
88:08 - and if i click it
88:10 - now we have the more text right the
88:13 - state is true so in terms of like
88:15 - rendering
88:16 - telling it when to render it's exactly
88:18 - the same right we just have the
88:20 - equivalent of an on click handler
88:22 - and that does not directly do anything
88:26 - uh to anything that's on the screen but
88:29 - what it does do is it changes the state
88:32 - every time there's a state change that
88:34 - triggers the re-render
88:36 - um so that's that's still how we're how
88:39 - we're handling things thanks again uh
88:41 - michael for setting me straight on
88:45 - how i needed to do that
89:03 - all right cool blake says uh the new
89:05 - version of firefox is good but i just
89:07 - prefer chrome
89:09 - john says the new firefox is good but
89:11 - just a day after chrome really pumped up
89:14 - their dev tools sticking with chrome
89:16 - here
89:16 - yeah that's what i'm wondering my my big
89:18 - question with the new firefox is how are
89:21 - the dev tools because i like chrome's
89:23 - devtools so for me it doesn't really
89:25 - matter how fast
89:28 - firefox is
89:29 - if chrome has better devtools i'm
89:31 - sticking with chrome at least for dev
89:33 - if i'm just looking on the internet for
89:35 - something else then i'll go with firefox
89:38 - but
89:40 - actually to be honest with you if i'm
89:41 - just browsing online
89:43 - i'm using my phone
89:45 - if i'm on a laptop or a desktop i'm most
89:48 - likely working so
89:50 - i'm still gonna try it obviously but
89:53 - that's gonna be the deciding factor for
89:55 - me is the dev tools
90:03 - okay
90:04 - so that's the end of the live chat no
90:07 - more questions or comments uh so it's
90:10 - we actually ended up getting more coding
90:12 - done than i thought we would
90:14 - uh so a lot of new exciting things
90:16 - happening
90:17 - and
90:19 - i'll be setting up some more repos and
90:21 - hopefully adding some more issues to
90:22 - those repo so whether you're interested
90:25 - in
90:26 - regular react
90:28 - react with gatsby react with
90:31 - next create react app react native
90:36 - or
90:37 - using react with electron
90:39 - there will be something for you
90:41 - to learn from and contribute to so i'm
90:44 - really excited about that it feels like
90:45 - we're we're covering like all the react
90:48 - areas now we just need something with
90:50 - redux i think and then we'll really be
90:52 - like hitting all the major things
90:56 - but those will all be available we'll be
90:58 - talking about all those uh in the in the
91:00 - coming month

91:07 - we are going to branch out a bit and uh
91:09 - this will be cool i hope we have some
91:11 - more people you know contributing to the
91:13 - code
91:14 - and helping
91:15 - helping you to learn and build up your
91:17 - portfolios
91:19 - um
91:21 - cool all right so i will stream tomorrow
91:23 - i'm gonna
91:24 - i'm gonna try my best to stream tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i have a lot of stuff to talk about we probably won't be doing that much coding so i hope that's all right but i want to give you a little recap of how things were at november and then we have a lot of stuff coming up this month and in in january so i want to give you all an overview of all the different things that we'll be working on and then if you'd like to you know help work on some of those things that'd be great i'll probably make repos for everything that i talk about today soon if there aren't already repos for them and then we can you know start opening issues and pull requests some of these projects can be really fun uh technologies we haven't worked with before so i'm hoping that i'm hoping this will be exciting to hear all this news and it'll make up for the lack of of code so first off uh let me talk about november sorry okay there we go the analytics on youtube were saying that no one was watching for a long time so just checking so november was really really fun and i i talked about my experience with with this stream with with live coding and i got a just so many positive comments afterwards uh it was amazing it went you know better than i could have hoped for uh so the video of my talk is on my youtube channel so it's the first video on the channel right now i can paste in a link for you all let me do that now and that way you can check it out if you want uh maybe i'll put a link in the description for those of you who are watching the recording hopefully i remember to do that and we'll put it in i don't always remember to put in the links when i say i'm going to all right so here's the link now in the live chat and um of course you're probably not going to want to watch it right now if you missed the stream um but uh oh okay cool it looks like uh rook already watched it um do you like the humble joke cool i yeah i i thought it was cool i thought it was funny i'm drinking the worst coffee i've ever had in my life right now i don't know how long had been sitting in the pot right because i was gone in nashville for the last three days so it's entirely possible that coffee's been sitting there for more than a day i just warmed it up the microwave for a long time hoping to kill any bacteria and it's really bad but um i didn't have time to actually make fresh coffee because the stream was starting so alright so let me talk a little bit about uh the cool things at november and and then we'll get to the project so if anybody happens to be watching the stream and you're at november uh say hi in the live chat if you can and that'd be really cool so just some of the highlights and if anybody's watching and you're a speaker or i talk to you in november and i forget to bring up bring you up is one of the highlights i apologize but it's hard to remember things being on the spot live so uh cool thing gabrielle from microsoft she did a node robotics workshop that was amazing we actually built a a node bot that was a little car that you could control with node from your keyboard so the code was literally like um you know when you press the right arrow key uh then the node bot will go right so it was controlling uh the wheels based on uh like we had a little battery pack and this little thing called a photon which is kind of like an arduino i mean it was really cool a little motor so cool um so and i actually got to keep the stuff for the nodebot so i think i took it apart to bring it home and i think i'm going to make it with my kids so that was a really kind of cool highlight don't know that i'll use it for my job here but it was it was fun to see how that works and maybe i'll find some some practical use for it around here um also uh there was a great talk um about the one of the keynotes from ben ben alegbedu uh gave a talk on why eventbrite switched to react uh so he wrote this really long like 19 page paper convincing everyone at eventbrite why react was the way to go and they were switching from backbone and there were a lot of cool things in there that i had never considered that was a good reason to go with react so i i really like that uh let me think what else um there is a cool presentation from someone at github uh her name was shelley so shelly from github gave a presentation on async await which was really cool because we've started using that in some of our projects and it was cool to learn about she basically went through the history of how you do things like that so from callbacks uh to promises talked a little bit about generators and then onto async await so it gave me like a nice overview of how that sort of thing has been handled in javascript so very useful and i know i'm forgetting so many other things but i mean really the biggest highlight was meeting so many developers from all over um really all over the united states from so many different companies um from big companies like microsoft i actually met um and got to talk to marie from microsoft who works on the um office uh was it the outlook app uh she builds micro services for the outlook app which is cool all the way to like local um small companies that were local in nashville that talk from you know devs from there uh just really cool i got to talk to some people from heroku and um netlify and that's actually gonna i'm gonna bring that up later when we talk about our projects because i think we're going to do some stuff with netlify and possibly with heroku as well so anyway if anybody from november happens to be watching now or later on you watch the recording um you all were awesome especially anybody who i talked to um you're awesome i enjoyed so much you know meeting everyone and talking everybody was just so nice and um so hopefully some of those people from november will start watching the stream occasionally and we can keep in touch all right so let me check the live chat quickly to see if there's any node member related questions uh and then we'll move on um also i guess one other thing the uh the free stuff at november was awesome i got cool tshirts i'm wearing i don't know how i can show you i'm not i'm not gonna try to show you but i'm wearing heroku socks right now which look really cool i've got a bunch of stickers um free time uh on heroku so um 500 free dino hours on heroku i did get a cool fidget spinner um from oh no it doesn't say the the company name i'm sorry i really wanted to give him a shout out but it doesn't say the name i got a cool water bottle that is branded for november so anyway highly recommend going to november if you can uh for 2018. i'll try to go back there if i can it was really cool um maybe they want me to speak again i don't know i have to come up with something different to talk about um so as we said let's see how brett said jesse you deserve a fresh cup every day fresh cup of coffee thanks for that um oh cool john says i'm a natural at talking yeah that's yeah it seems like i have the talking down i just need to talk less in code more right that's the that's what everyone says street fighter motorcycles says i look at the screen i have a notification from you i push the button and you're talking about this thing drinking bad coffee what are you talking about i'm worried now my blood pressure is up uh i got a hard thing please i need to know if the coffee is good i'm worried the coffee is terrible that's what i get for trying to warm up old coffee i have no idea how old it is um shri count says tell us about tell us something about november i'm new to your channel um oh yeah if you're not i keep saying november i didn't explain anything about what it was it's a javascript conference uh specifically geared around node but there were a lot of talks about frontend stuff as well uh node.js being javascript that can run on the on the server uh so really good conference it was in nashville tennessee a lot of the talks were about react um or like somewhat react related stuff like graphql which is frequently used with react but then there was other stuff like the nodebot thing that had nothing to do with react just you know reacts just really popular now so anyway so i got a lot from it because we work with react and um so there are a lot of things you know that i can apply now to our projects all right oh i guess someone from argentina hey how's it going also from new york great and um actually i met three people in november from the dominican republic which was awesome because i've never met anyone from the dominican republic before and then now within like two days i met three people and they're all really really nice awesome people so if anybody's from the dominican republic watching uh say hi and um let's see oh someone from brazil from bosnia awesome yeah people from all over i love it uh okay so now let me move into some of our projects i'm gonna throw a lot of stuff at you oh cool we got someone from dominican republic great let me angel eduardo rodriguez felix awesome hey i'm from dominican republic 2. all right cool we have two people from dominican republic here all right we have some from india i always have people from india india is well represented i think in the uh in the streams it's awesome and i always am like amazed that you all in india stay up so late to watch this and uh thanks thank you for that that's like it's amazing to me that that you are willing to stay up um oh kenya awesome if someone from kenya all right so i'm going to throw a lot at you with these projects now so um i'm not going to go in depth into any one of them because i want to make sure i get them all in and then if there's questions you have about any of the projects let me know and then i'll talk more about the projects that you are more interested in and i'll just kind of go quickly through the stuff that maybe is not so interesting to you let's see uh from the ukraine we have algeria norway awesome yeah urine from from norway i i remember thank you for reminding me um because i remember i had trouble pronouncing that at one time so um okay so let's talk about let's talk first about the project we've been working on right because i did uh say that this was still part of project five so i want to make sure we talk about project five so it's not misleading so that's this main website that we've been building we started in gatsby and then we switched to react but we kept our gatsby branch open so here's what i'm thinking all right i had i merged some pull requests in so thank you for everybody for the pull request and um i will maybe i'll go over that and at some point today or tomorrow we had a cup at least one person it was their first pull request i think so congratulations on that but i talked to some people who know a lot more about gatsby than i do and i think that it will be very doable to do this site in gatsby before i was kind of not sure about it you know partly because i i'd never used gatsby before so i i really just had no idea no experience as to whether or not what we wanted to accomplish would be best accomplished with gatsby and i think that it we can and i think it may end up being faster so here's what i'd like to do i'd like to build out the sites both sites the next version and the gatsby version just a little bit more to the point where we're actually pulling some data from a like a test uh wordpress installation i will try to pull it with graphql and i'd like to set up both of them in a production environment and then test the speed and potentially to even test like the load on servers if we can from what i've heard at november gatsby should be faster if we set it up the way that i was i was talking about so um i think i i know this is crazy to keep trying to develop these well you know we're we're not that far into the development of this site so i don't know let me know what you all think about it but it just seems like it seems like the speed advantage is going to be significant um so in particular i do i want to thank uh brian douglas from netlify so i you know i doubt who he'll ever watch this or anything but i just want to thank him for taking the time to go through explaining a lot about how gatsby and netlify handle sites like this like where we're pulling data from the api um and how the rebuilds work and and all that so so that is the big the big kind of change for this project that will i th that we'll do it will try to do so if anybody is more interested in working with gatsby than you are with next feel free to start working on the branch what i'd like to do is keep them as similar as possible so in terms of ui it's they're going to be identical which should make it a little bit easier is you know all the ui stuff can pretty much just be copied and then the only things that will really change is um kind of our server setup right because the routing with gatsby was similar right it was just the stuff that's in the pages file i believe uh the pages folder i mean so anyway we'll have to take a closer look at that and work on it um but i have a much at least i think i have a much better understanding of how that would actually work uh so anyway that's big change number one we're gonna most likely go back and be doing some updates on our very first project that we did on the stream that catechetical institute website that we built with next wordpress the wordpress api uh we did serverside rendering a lot of caching in there we're doing load balancing on that so if you weren't with us during that project you know check out the repo for it uh if you go to the repo with all the other projects i think it's called ci react so i'm gonna probably open up some issues in that repository for the new things but just to give you a heads up i'm gonna have a meeting i think next week or the week after i can't remember the date with the people who are in charge of that that project uh the catechetical institute some of the things they've requested are um basically a a space kind of above the fold on the home page for uh new like news and and stuff so that they can kind of pin it to the top all this new stuff so we already have that section at the bottom so there's going to have to be some discussion on what this is going to look like since we already have a section that does exactly that could could we just move the section up and maybe redesign it so that it's not quite as big i don't know we'll have to discuss it but if you all have any suggestions for that let me know and then i could bring it up in the meeting or also we're going to add some new sections that'll basically be identical to some existing sections so that's not really even worth discussing um they'd like to maybe update that find a nearby event section that we already had the geolocation in but we just need to build out the ui so that it's obvious that you can use the geo location so we had never finished finished that before so we'll get to that so if anybody has any ideas for you know kind of an intuitive way uh to basically for a user to know that these fields are clickable and they could sort by them in a way that looks nice you know mobile desktop uh and it's pretty obvious and fits with the overall material design scheme and the particular color scheme for that site um let's see oh we're gonna have to do some forms most likely so it's not like we haven't done anything like this before but we currently don't have any forms on that site so we're gonna have probably two forms and uh so it's not gonna be a big deal i don't think we need file uploads at all so it's gonna be pretty basic but you know we'll need some form elements we'll need some um the word just slipped my mind when you check form validation that's it so we need some form validation um let's see okay they're not happy with the font size so they think the font size is too large so um we'll see we'll see i'm i'm more likely i like to have a larger font for readability uh so i'll have to let you know how that goes um that will be hard to change though and uh good news is that resource page that we spent so much time building they love the resource page and they thanked us they thanked me for all the hard work but i know that you all did a lot of the work too so i'm going to extend that thanks to you all for that and we may end up adding an entirely new page to the site that would be a place to submit advice and then also have that advice displayed for everyone so that's a possibility uh that's listed as something that would come in the future that we might not have to work on um you know this month or even next month so uh i'm gonna check the live chat see if there's any questions about some of the updates that i just talked about before i move on and uh let me know too if you if you'd like to see like something else on the screen besides me i can switch back to the view where you see the code uh i don't have a lot of code to show you right now but um i'm happy to switch it if you uh if you like okay okay uh the wall says uh so are your past projects on mirn stack um what is that so mirn is what like exp help me out on mern i can't remember what the m is is the m [ __ ] is it [ __ ] x express reacts nginx okay so them is [ __ ] well yeah well we're somewhat on the mern stack we haven't really used [ __ ] uh very much did we use i think one of the projects that we haven't launched yet uses [ __ ] uh that bulletin project we got some updates for that too so we'll get to that i hope i don't forget because those are really exciting but basically all our projects we've used react if we need to do stuff like custom server stuff we're also doing some some things with with express obviously node we've used yeah so we have the urn of the mirn stack we have the ern um that's uh that's who yeah so thank thanks for the in the live chat thank you for uh letting me know what what the everything in mirn was so i had i had some of it right i forgot about the manga um yeah so basically we have everything except the [ __ ] all right let's see all right a lot of people saying hello there's somebody from birmingham uh uk there's a birmingham in the united states too so make sure you want to specify from romania but living in birmingham awesome albania cool um oh there's a new react update so john hanson mentioned react update 16.2 no more div around divs or using an array of components with named keys and commas uh react fragment is here awesome i'll have to check that out maybe um if if possible i'll try to use that feature in an upcoming stream i think that'd be really cool to you know try it out live as soon as we can um cool jordan says hey from ann arbor michigan awesome um all right let me move on to i think the most exciting things that we're going to work on so let me let me set up this scenario for you all to ex so that you all know why i think we should do this so as some of you may know recall i try my best to not complain on the stream but you may have heard me complain about the amount of support i have to provide for things like the bulletin or the resource center for the bulletin in particular the login process people just um almost always the problem is old browsers but occasionally there's some weird things with emails not being sent uh it's not really from our end the emails do get sent from ion they just don't get picked up by they get blocked basically i don't even want to say block because i don't even get a message that they're blocked they just get lost somewhere along the way i don't know why but anyway we have that problem and then in the resource center we have the problem with older browsers not accepting the forms being submitted so right now we have a disclaimer on our one of our forms that it does not work with older browsers but i think i figured out a way where we can just totally avoid all of that browser compatibility stuff and i was inspired to do this uh when i was talking uh with um shelly from github i cannot remember her last name so sorry um but shelly from github who is a speaker at november works on the electron team so if you're not familiar with electron it's a way to build um desktop apps for windows and mac i think also also linux i'm pretty sure that it works for linux too but you can build that in javascript html and css and it will run or as a desktop app so some examples of this are atom visual studio code slack maybe spotify i can't remember a spotify the desktop app runs on that or not but for sure the first three that i said so i think we should make the bulletin and the um the resource center desktop apps and mobile apps so we're going to be using react native for mobile and then is there a name for making electron apps with react does it have a special name or are we just is it just called electron and we'll just use react i don't know if there's a special name let me know um but i think that'll be so cool because we've never done anything with electron before and we've just kind of briefly looked at one of my projects that i did with um react native but i was just kind of showing you all how you know kind of the final result we didn't really work on it together so these are going to be like side projects that we'll do in parallel so i'll create repos for them i'll set up like the boilerplate so i'll use create react native app and get it started just to set up the repo and then i'm going to need to do my research on electron because i've never done anything with electron so whatever is the easiest way to just get something started we'll do that and then the process will simply be taking what we already have for those projects so the um resource center is already live and it's at a completed stage we'll we'll port those over uh to react native and to electron and then for the bulletin there's a little bit more we have to do for the bulletin to get it to a completed stage but we'll also have repos open for those so that when i have time i'll work on it when i can but as as you all may know my number one priority now is that main website that we're working on at project five so as i can i'll work on them but if any of you are really interested in learning more about react native or electron and you're you're kind of looking for a project then uh you know go ahead with this i'll try to do my best to keep up with pull requests and open up issues but the cool thing is is you all already know exactly what's expected from this because you can just check out what we've done on the just normal react versions of both of these uh so yeah so and these are some things that they don't need to be done there's no due date on these this is just kind of my idea i ran it by my boss this morning and he thought it was a great idea so you know i i we're gonna do them and it'll happen sometime but there's no due date on these so uh we'll just work when we can i think i think that's all uh the only other thing that i want everybody to still keep in mind is i'm looking for a good javascript cms that is as easy for a user to work with as wordpress in terms of being able to upload um data what i don't want is i know there are some cms's out there that are like you you pay for like monthly i don't want something like that i want something that is preferably entirely open source and can be selfhosted just like you know wordpress can be selfhosted but i'd love for it to be javascript so we don't have to mess with any php i mean obviously it needs to be very easily you know compatible with graphql netlify has a cms that i haven't looked into at all i just heard about uh i don't think that it will work for our use case but you know we we don't need to decide on that yet so i'm still kind of testing things out if we need to to get some data just to test things we'll use wordpress with graphql and that'll be fine because we could always plug in a different source of data later on all right i think that's all that i had in terms of new announcements if i think of something i i'll let you know um but i will um so hey i just got all these messages uh so just distracting me for a second um the really cool thing about the november conference as well is i made so many uh met so many new people and then the fact that you can just add people on twitter right away is great because then i can contact i love that we're not like exchanging business cards anymore right like it's just like okay what's your what's your twitter name you know right there and um now we can you know communicate like that anyway let me check the live chat quickly before we move on to something so i can answer any questions um street fighter says jess has the coffee gotten any better with age no it says if not i suggest instant coffee sticks i recommend them personally they are amazing an instant coffee stick would be an improvement on what i have right now um it definitely keeps me awake just from like the flavor in my mouth it's just awful i don't know why i keep drinking it i need to put it far away from me so i don't drink it anymore um let's see okay so um electron does work on all platforms thanks uh so angel do you pronounce your name angel or some other i mean because you're from dominican republic so i'm assuming that's not how you pronounce it let me know how you pronounce it i'm not going to try to guess and mess it up i want to know how you pronounce it so i can i can get it right uh world boss asks if i'm a freelancer um i am not a freelancer i was a freelancer for three years uh but now i am uh employed fulltime as a frontend developer i do some freelance work on the side still i'm currently not i sh well i take that back i'm currently doing like very minimal freelance work i have someone who's um like a friend of the family and i keep their wordpress blog up to date uh i upload some post form twice a month and uh twice a month i go and update plugins so it's really minimal i mean literally i make 15 a month off of them it's like super minimal um it's insane because i spend like way less than an hour a month uh on that site and i gave them a very good price because uh because of the connection the family connection uh anyway i am interested in doing freelance work so i don't want to be always doing something because it's hard on my family but if anybody ever has any projects and you know you'd like some help with them uh i'm open to that i'm really picky about what projects i do so i'm not going to guarantee that i will say yes to doing that but i i do like if it's a technology that i'm interested in that sounds fun then and and potentially if the if the price is right as well uh then i'm i'm definitely interested in in doing that um let's see of a few other questions john hanson says uh jesse i wonder if some of the email delivery issue comes from dkim and spf pass in the header of the message this is a serverside setting it needs to be in place from the web hosting servers all right i honestly have i i don't know anything about um those issues i've never heard about that before um so you may be right but i don't even know how to check that so so anyway john if you have more info about that can give me some more direction i can try to check into it i assume that it was a problem with the university's email servers since basically i can trace it through sendgrid and sendgrid says that it's delivered um but they still don't see it and i know other people have had similar issues with other things other than sendgrid um i'm hoping so at the end of the month we're going to switch over to use instead of group wise we're gonna use outlook i was hoping that with that switch it might help things that's why i haven't really been like digging too far into it because i thought it may end up being a waste but i'm i i don't know that much about email servers and things like that so i'm definitely open to any advice you all have okay so the spanish pronunciation of angels different um so what would you say so is it like angel or something like that i don't know all right you know what let's look this up right now all right so i got it oh man this is killing me i have to watch a commercial to watch a five second video on how to pronounce it according to youtube that's it all right and that's cool okay so on on hill says yes that's good all right awesome i think it's important to do my best to pronounce uh your names correctly so anyway um all right uh brett says possibly starting a job right next to blue bottle coffee in oakland california have you tried blue bottle i have not tried a blue bottle um is it really good i'm not sure if i can get blue bottle coffee out here in eastern ohio oh cool street fighter says shelley from github is an amazing person i've never met her but i've listened to people who have um yeah like i only talked with her uh we were both um in the speaker's lounge like prepping for our speeches at this our talks at the same time so just kind of like you know occasionally talking uh but yeah she seemed really amazing i mean and she's not even out of college yet and she's already working for github and and doing cool work with electron a lot of cplus plus work yeah really cool so i think i mean she's gonna be like i think an amazing programmer already right you know being so young and already um you know doing such great work so um yeah so it was really cool to get to meet her all right brett says so we are swapping next js for gatsy gatsby on uh fus marcom no not on fus let me you know what let me switch uh my screen and bring up the repo just so that uh we're 100 on the same page i should have done this right off the bat when we were looking at this um where are we at it's more chromes franciscan react yeah this is it franciscan reacts okay so this this repo so the uh it is in the fus marcom organization and then the franciscan react site so we have branches right now so we have a gatsby branch and we have our master branch we also had a next branch but that was merged into master and it's no longer being updated um so the master right now is next and then we have that gatsby branch what i'd like to do is uh puts basically i want to pull in data into the master so that we can run a test of being able to pull in data from graphql from probably wordpress server side rendering that and then serving that and then doing the same thing with gatsby but instead of serverside rendering it will build a static site um and then push that to the client so i'd like to get them to the same point with just like minimal ui and bringing in the same data and then just do some testing on it to see like which one's easier to deploy and work with which one is faster uh i think it would be cool i know there's articles and people have already done stuff like this but i think it would be really cool to do it live on the stream uh i don't know i think there's value in that if you guys uh if you all think that that's kind of a waste of time let me know but uh sometimes it's just cool to you know try it and see the results being able to like tweak things on our own you know and and see how it changes uh the the load times and things uh also you know being able to see like what's the size of the the files that get sent to the client you know will one give us you know less that needs to be sent because that's you know ideal um anyway so that's the plan and while i'm in here on github i'll just so that we're clear on the other things um let me make this biggest this one okay so we're gonna do this resource center here the resource center repo we're going to make another repo that'll probably be resource center uh react native and then we'll have a resource center electron and we'll build it out react native build it out an electron i do want to make sure when we build out with react native we use the proper components so that it will work on ios and android if you've never used react native that might be confusing but there are some components that only work on android so we don't want to use those if we do use those we definitely want to have a check first like a ternary and if statement saying you know if it's not ios then use this so i'm okay with that as long as we account for that so um i mean i'll talk about it more when we actually make those repos and everything but uh just keep that in mind and then on this bulletin react which isn't finished yet we're going to also have an electron version of this that'll be a separate repo and a react native version that'll be a separate repo and again if you weren't here uh when i discussed this the reason behind this is that i'm having a lot of trouble with people with really old browsers trying to view this and uh it's it's causing me a lot of time to have to uh handle that kind of thing and it's so i usually the complaint comes in to someone else in my department they have to handle it then i have to handle it and then what i usually have to do is go over check it out because often at times they don't know what browser they have and then i don't have the um the access to be able to update their browser i need an admin password for that and i don't have like kind of the universal admin password so then i have to get in contact with somebody from the i t department and then hope that they get over there and upgrade everything correctly so you can see it for each time that happens it takes a lot of time out so the solution i'm i'm thinking is have electron which if they're using electron right then they're automatically getting a version of of chrome a version of chromium um that will work so they won't realize it but they're essentially downloading the browser that they need to run it properly so i and i believe i need to test this out on windows but on a mac even if you don't have an admin password you can still download electron apps and they work so i have done that before um on a mac that i didn't have an admin password for so assuming that it also works with windows then that would be really great so anyway uh also i think it'll just be really cool and a great experience for for me and for all of you to be able to build ios app an android app and a desktop app that will work crossplatform to build all that together i think it'll be some great skills uh that can be in in your portfolio uh and some great skills you know be able to take like our starting point and then you all can use that and modify it to make your own apps or your own uh you know desktop apps with electron i just i think it'd be really fun okay john hanson uh talking again about the email thing says once you look up these two items dkim and spf and get them set it can mean a difference of mail taking hours days not at all versus the mail going through in seconds contact the web hosting service okay cool i'll have to i'll probably have to talk to the it department then i'll look it up though because i'm not i'm still not 100 sure whether that'd be something on the email sending or the receiving side uh so i will have to um look that up i'm still hopeful that maybe it'll be fixed when we switch to outlook okay cool angel says i think if we have time to do all that uh that test the performance it'll be good and we will learn more on the run yeah you know what that's a good point if we have time to do that if you remember we still need to have this done by midfebruary preferably early february so we can have more time for testing and this thing needs to launch by the end of february so you're right we need to keep that in mind so this testing needs to happen soon like let's try to get both of the branches to the point where we can get a decent test within the next week and then we'll make our decision and there's no more second guessing and it's me that's doing all the second guessing so i'm gonna promise to no more second guessing whatever we pick at that point we're gonna stick with it and we're not gonna switch at least not for months and months so that'll be the goal before the end of next week we'll make a final decision based on our testing matt robinson didn't know you were going to be in my neck of the woods oh so or matt are you um from around nashville then if so yeah i wish i wish um we could have connected i actually had very little time the one thing about november that was good or bad depending on how you look at it is it was just packed with stuff uh breakfast for the conference started at 8 am and then the keynotes were over at 6 00 pm and then after that every single night there was some type of event so you know really you could go from 8 a.m to 8 p.m or later pretty much every day of the conference so it was packed with stuff i had hoped to get some pull requests merged and things at the conference but i i had no time when i did have any time i was like taking a nap because um it was it was exhausting but good it was it was good exhausting all right let's see i am on time 250. let's see okay so i think that's all i wanted to say in terms of updates just checking briefly yeah that's it in terms of the update so we got a lot of stuff uh kind of planned out and i guess we could i tell you what we still have we've only we've been streaming for less than an hour so i usually go longer than this let's do one pomodoro cycle of setting up the react native repo for let's say let's do one for the resource center since the resource center's already finished so i'm going to go through the setup process we're going to use create react native app and then we'll set up the repo and then that way we'll have at least one of the repos that we need to set up so one out of the four new ones that we're going to have uh i don't think we've yeah we've definitely not done this on a stream so if you've never used react native before hopefully this will be beneficial to you and where's my pomodoro i have it somewhere all right let's use this pomodoro clock and let me pull over my my terminal okay let me make this big enough so that you all can see it okay so first thing i'm going to do is cd in my into my projects folder and so here's what i'm gonna do i will be going to the create react native app github page and following the instructions for that and you all can follow along if you want if you just search for create react native app for me on google the very first uh result that came up was the github page so we're going to install that globally here i'm just going to copy over what's on there just to save time so let's install is that is it over already that was like super fast amazing all right cool um all right so i'm in the projects folder and i'm going to say create react native app and then we're going to give it a name so this is our resource center so let's call it our i'm gonna call it rc rc native i read somewhere that there was some weird issue where you can't use camelcase or hyphens i can't remember exactly what the issue was but that's why i'm going to make it like this which is a little weird but just so that we don't run into that issue that's that's why i'm doing this every time i've ever used this which was once i just had one word and it was all lowercase so i've never dealt with that issue so what this is going to do is uh give us kind of a starting point for react native app and when it goes when it's all done we'll have a new folder named rc native that we'll be able to go into and we should be able to see basically it'll be a working app let's see while it's going through its thing i'm going to check the live chat john hanson says does this mean i'm personally soon going to be building a react native app i'm just getting used to create react app blaming all of it on you jk yeah yeah we're gonna do react native um don't worry if you are intimidated that's exactly how i felt before i made my first one it's so much easier than than you might think all right so yarn starts and the expo all right so let's cd rc native which it gives you nice instructions right there uh and then let's let's yarn start i don't know if i have everything i need on this computer i do have my laptop i thought i downloaded everything i need we'll see i do have so on your phones you will need to download if you want to work on this an app called expo that's expo so you can see you're talking about expo here and that'll allow you to preview what's going on directly on your phone uh which is awesome and uh so i'm gonna go uh here in my search bar and and and expo now i could potentially um i'm trying to think if this always runs i don't remember if this always runs over wifi or if you can plug in your phone and have it run like that but this should work as long as i'm on the same network which let me double check that i am on the same network i am cool um let's see let me open up expo and maybe i'll uh make my screen bigger just to show you all you can also use um the emulator so let me open up the ios emulator so you can see it there oh i could just scan the qr code what am i thinking similar because of a problem all right so it looks like i could not open it q let me display that qr code again it's way too big i need to make this smaller so i can see it oh okay cool it worked now um yeah so let me make my screen my camera bigger so you can see some of this it's all right i'll let you see it when it actually gets finished it does take a minute oh shoot what happened sorry try to scan this again all right almost done now if i was thinking properly i would have put up i would have used visors you can see this on the screen but i wasn't planning on doing this oh what the heck happened dismissed come on if you shake it you can reload so you can see i shook it and hit reload hmm unidentified is not an object evaluating native version major all right i'm not exactly sure um i'm not sure what the problem is i'm currently getting an error message and the glares you probably can't see because of the glare so that's odd i've never gotten an error message right away what i do want to do though is duplicate this tab quickly and then open up atom just to show you the file structure all right um see we have all our node modules which is always a lot um let's see our app.js there we go okay so check this out this looks almost exactly like the regular react uh that we're used to using uh i'm still on me sorry there we go check this out now um look at this we're importing react from react and then we're importing a couple of components from react native right export default class right this is all familiar and then we're rendering return we have a view which when you see view and react native think div okay and then when you see text instead of p tags or even h tags we have our text tags so and look at our style sheet so we have our styles here we're using flexbox we have a background color right so without i know i can't get this to show up but we already know exactly what this is going to look like right we have our container that's going to have a white background we're using flex all right it's going to take up the full screen we're going to center it so the items will be centered both vertically and horizontally and all we're going to have are three lines of text and it's going to say this right just like we have in there so so easy we could check out our package json and see it's just simple now of course this is the create react native app right if we ejected it would be way more complicated but for now this is what we have we run start when we're um when we're in development mode and i believe if we want to make an android app we type android and it creates all the files we need and then if we want to do with ios it says we just type ios so npm start ios or or i'm sorry npm run ios or we could just do yarn ios um yeah super easy and that's it and this is i i still i have no idea what the issue is with the um with the error that i'm getting but maybe i'll just i'll try one more time to restart this and then if it still doesn't work then i'm not going to try it again alright so in the live chat oh blake got in here late it's cool blake um no actually blake this is an electron right now this is react native so we will be working with electron in the future uh but right now i was trying to set up react native but i keep getting an error saying undefined is not an object evaluating native version major dot major and node modules oh man yeah um don't know why this is not working see you might have been getting started hmm that's my npm version okay i have the the right version that should work um let's see i did let me double check i did check on the network so on hill says check the network yeah it is the the correct network hmm let me um it's already up to date okay all right let me i just totally turned off um that instance of the app that i was trying to run an expo and now i restarted the server and now i'm going to try to open it again and see if something happened maybe i'm like gonna flush out yay it worked awesome okay i don't know what happened at first but once i i turned it off and turned it back on and then that fixed it so um let me show you i know it's going to be hard to see and like again i'm sorry i didn't set it up so i could show it on my screen um but here's our uh trying to get out of the glare you can probably maybe barely see it depending on what your screen resolution is but there's the text that we had um open up app it's all backwards for me who's trying to look at it uh open up app.js to start working on your app so there we go so essentially in just a few minutes it would have been shorter if i would have just restarted it right off the bat um and got it working but in just a few minutes we actually have an android app that works now we didn't bundle this all in the correct file format or anything like that so i mean i guess technically it's not exactly like an android app but you know we have it running via expo uh on an android phone right now and if i had an ios device it would i could do the same thing so last thing i want to do which i think i still have time yeah we have about nine minutes left in this pomodoro session so what i'd like to do now is make a github repo for this just bare minimum github repo i'm just going to change just a bit and let's say i don't want to say mobile app i'm going to say react native oh my typing is terrible today okay remove these and save that and now we're going to make a get repo out of this and then push that up it'll be in there obviously there's like so much we want to do this is the bare minimum of of apps that we could make right now oh no i didn't have my screen on i'm i'm really bad at that at having my screen um switch back over so you all can see what i'm doing okay um so what we need to do first is a git init all right so we are in the folder right our project folder we're going to do a get init um let's see yeah okay great um git commit uh let me make sure i have a um a get ignore file yes i do awesome i thought it came automatically but i just wanted to be sure so we're going to git commit and it's uh get in it and so i commit a um there we go so after my silliness there i had to add the files first before i could commit them obviously um sorry about that okay now we have our repository let's go ahead and create a repository in github and then link the two up and then we can push what we have so far up to github and then now if anybody wants to take a look at it or mess with it or anything then then you'll have that let's see github and we're going to create a new repository we're going to do it under the fus marcom organization and we're going to call this rrc native um make that public and i don't want to add anything right now we can add in our license and we already have a git ignore we can add in the readme later actually we already have a readme we'll just have to edit it so let's create okay so now we already have a repository so we're just going to copy each of these lines i never tried copying both the lines at once would that work i guess it would but in this one we're gonna oops you all probably can't see that huh there we go um we're gonna add right this is our like ssh address for a repo so we're gonna add that and then our next one we're going to actually push to the repo that we've just linked to great now we should be able to see that code that we just had yep so here we go um here's our there we go there's our code and there's our text that we edited all right so that's that's ready to go so now we have a repo to work out of like i said earlier i'm not going to be working primarily on this or any of our other electron or native things that we're going to do because that's not that's not a priority right now for me um it's just something that will be helpful and that i really like to work on but i will keep up with the pull requests or at least i'll do my best to keep up with them and i'll bring them up from time to time you know if things change and if we do work on some of these things all right and my cycle yeah the palm door cycle is almost over so i'm going to go back to the live chat i'm going to answer any questions that you all have and after i get to the bottom of the live chat we'll finish up the stream for today oh okay on hill said i could also check out if there uh if there's a new version of expo um that's a good idea i mean we got it to work but that's still a good idea to make sure everything is is up to date uh john hanson says looks easy yeah right yes it looks familiar what is the trigger or logic to call the app to render on a device as opposed to a desktop create react app um it should be it's it's the same so essentially in terms of what's going on in the background i have no idea right i it's and it's working differently depending on if it's ios or android but in terms of you know as a developer what we have to do um the triggering the render works the same way everything is controlled by the state right so you you never um just like in uh normal react you never manipulate manipulate the dom directly it's the same thing here even though we don't even have a dom um you change the state and then things are you know here in the state so just for instance let's just say oops so we could do this and we say i can't believe i'm losing my mind where do i put state up here right um so our state uh is going to be display display text it's false we're going to say it's false right now um oops not that this latex is false and so we would do something like this right um display text where's my hopefully this is answering your question and i'm not like totally missing the point here okay so um if we save that i get i'll get an error can't find oops sorry state this state the display text okay so our state is false and let's see if i can open debug.js remotely let's try to open up this remote debugger and i have no idea where this is gonna open up at i have too many screens open and i can't find the debugger there it is all right so let's inspect and uh let's let's pop this out and make it bigger here's our debugger oh goodness all right let's go to our react oh no do we not even do we not have the react debugger well this is not this is not good why do i not have the react debugger oh well i can't do what i wanted to do all right let's get rid of that we'll just add something this thing all right so let's do is that how it is i think that's what it is in react native um a little touch this set state uh and then we'll just do um display text true so i have to do it's crazy i haven't coded anything for a week and now i'm like forgetting everything um all right let's just save see if i get an error all right not working all right so i'm i'm not gonna uh try to work with this anymore because obviously i'm i'm forgetting too much it has been over a month since i did anything with react native so i'm messing something up but i guess i can just do this just to even see if my code is correct at all there we go um so we can see the state is true um really small there uh so you could probably see that we have two lines you can't really read it but anyway um sorry i just went through all that and i couldn't get it to work i'm guessing that my issue is i i don't know what um what the right handler is here i don't think you can do it on click because you're not clicking but i can't remember what what you're supposed to do and hill says uh you can set up an android simulator on your window or iphone simulator on ios to work with expo yeah so i that's true um so i don't have it set up you can actually set up the android thing on ios 2 but last time i checked it was just more complicated than i wanted to do since i already have an android device it's easier just to run it on there i tried to get the simulator to come up but i got an error so i just didn't really feel like trying to fix it you know on the stream but if we do start working with it a lot on the stream i'll make sure i get the simulator at very least for ios up and running um let's see all right so native w01 says jesse have you tried the new version of firefox it's called firefox quantum and it's pretty dang good just made the switch from chromium or from chrome today i have not tried it yet but i've heard really good things about it so um i may have to try that soon um has anyone else used it like i everybody's saying it's super fast i know it says are you going to create some issues i will create some issues uh i'll do my best to create them soon let me think what i have i gotta think about what else i need to do that like needs done right now if so if i have time today maybe i'll try to do some issues otherwise i'll try to get them in there sometime soon blake says i use ssh to pull repo once and every minute it would ask me for my ssh password while i was working on it how i'm trying to think how i set it up you should be able to set it up so that you don't you don't need to it won't ask you for your ssh password actually you know what i do see if this works all right so blake the next time you um use ssh to pull rebo do this and see if it works uh yeah so do ssh add so ssh hyphen add hit enter it'll ask for uh your passphrase and then enter it in there and then you should need to enter it in again i don't have to enter in again until i restart my computer which is infrequently so once you do that as long as you don't restart things then you won't need to put in uh your password again uh alex b says jesse i'm new to free code camp i saw you uh did a lot of videos with multiple technologies can you recommend me a playlist a series to start from um i guess at this point it does depend a little bit about what you're interested in but most of our projects have used react um so it might maybe you want to start with project five day one and because it'd be really easy for you to catch up because we're not that far into the project if you're not worried about catching up with the live stream then i would go with maybe project three or four i'm trying to think what was project three maybe project four then uh because those are kind of simple to get started with we're using create react app to start with one of those i don't recommend starting with project one anymore because it's already kind of out of date we started that months ago they're already we use next they're already new versions of next and we use jquery with um with react which i don't recommend doing so yeah so start with you can start with really any of the projects but i would not recommend starting with project one project five is the best if you want to catch up to the live stream quickly oh okay uh michael is saying you should use touchable opacity and on press okay let's let's try that um let's do that all right cool let me try this kind of chosen oops i might have to put text in for some of the uh buttons in react native you have to put text inside and for some of them you don't i can't remember which ones you do and don't so yep i think that was it great all right cool so let me uh reload this and just show you um let me move my camera okay all right so this is going to be really small so right now i know it's hard to see but if we have our click me button there it's just text and if i click it now we have the more text right the state is true so in terms of like rendering telling it when to render it's exactly the same right we just have the equivalent of an on click handler and that does not directly do anything uh to anything that's on the screen but what it does do is it changes the state every time there's a state change that triggers the rerender um so that's that's still how we're how we're handling things thanks again uh michael for setting me straight on how i needed to do that all right cool blake says uh the new version of firefox is good but i just prefer chrome john says the new firefox is good but just a day after chrome really pumped up their dev tools sticking with chrome here yeah that's what i'm wondering my my big question with the new firefox is how are the dev tools because i like chrome's devtools so for me it doesn't really matter how fast firefox is if chrome has better devtools i'm sticking with chrome at least for dev if i'm just looking on the internet for something else then i'll go with firefox but actually to be honest with you if i'm just browsing online i'm using my phone if i'm on a laptop or a desktop i'm most likely working so i'm still gonna try it obviously but that's gonna be the deciding factor for me is the dev tools okay so that's the end of the live chat no more questions or comments uh so it's we actually ended up getting more coding done than i thought we would uh so a lot of new exciting things happening and i'll be setting up some more repos and hopefully adding some more issues to those repo so whether you're interested in regular react react with gatsby react with next create react app react native or using react with electron there will be something for you to learn from and contribute to so i'm really excited about that it feels like we're we're covering like all the react areas now we just need something with redux i think and then we'll really be like hitting all the major things but those will all be available we'll be talking about all those uh in the in the coming month and uh our main project is still going to be project five so that'll get the most attention but we are going to branch out a bit and uh this will be cool i hope we have some more people you know contributing to the code and helping helping you to learn and build up your portfolios um cool all right so i will stream tomorrow i'm gonna i'm gonna try my best to stream tomorrow i may have to attend a three hour long training session on leadership i would rather not but it's not up to me so that's going to take out a big chunk of my day i'll let you know if and when i can stream on twitter tomorrow and of course i will schedule a stream so you should get a notification if you're subscribed to the free code camp channel just in case i don't stream if you still want to see me you can check out on my channel my personal channel which is linked in the description i believe you can check out my talk from november that i just gave on tuesday afternoon about live streaming and live coding so uh so you can still watch me somewhat live um if you watch this that was like a shameless plug wasn't it but um anyway you guys might like it or you all might like it because i talk about you in a very good way uh in my um my talk from november so check that out if you get a minute it's only 30 minutes long a little less than 30 minutes uh all right so until then like i said hopefully i see you all tomorrow i really really hope i can because i haven't streamed for a while and i miss it um but if not i guess i'll see you uh ceo on monday but uh either way have a great day and i will be back soon
