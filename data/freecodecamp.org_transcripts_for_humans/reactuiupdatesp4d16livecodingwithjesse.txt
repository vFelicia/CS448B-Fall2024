00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:09 - with jesse
00:11 - today we're gonna
00:13 - handle some ui stuff in particular
00:17 - the first thing i'd like to
00:20 - go over
00:24 - is this uh search input here
00:27 - so
00:29 - i'd like to add
00:31 - a
00:32 - little icon
00:34 - so that a user could close
00:37 - the search
00:39 - uh let's see
00:41 - we had something like this on another
00:43 - project
00:45 - let me show you what i'm what i'm
00:47 - thinking about
00:54 - yes
00:57 - um so i think it'd be something like
00:59 - this uh you know what i think we have a
01:01 - bug right now but you'll be able to see
01:03 - it
01:03 - maybe
01:04 - no
01:07 - oh well basically
01:10 - what i'd like to happen is you click
01:12 - this it pops out
01:14 - and then
01:15 - there's an icon to close it
01:18 - and you can also click on the search
01:20 - icon and that will initiate a search
01:24 - so that's the idea
01:31 - all right so we don't need
01:33 - that project up right now
01:35 - let's get that out of the way
01:37 - um
01:38 - we do have a getter channel now so if
01:41 - you're interested in that um
01:45 - check out i don't know what link to give
01:49 - i guess
01:50 - let me give you this link i think
01:52 - that'll work i'm gonna paste this in the
01:54 - live chat now
01:57 - oh
02:00 - all right see now the uh the camera's
02:02 - frozen from uh
02:04 - goodness
02:05 - all right let's move that out of the way
02:07 - let me grab this one
02:10 - which is way too big let's see if we can
02:12 - shrink it
02:18 - i must have uh i think i was messing
02:20 - with this at some point
02:22 - and got the
02:24 - dimensions all messed up
02:29 - it's kind of odd that it just started
02:31 - happening
02:36 - it hasn't happened in a really long time
02:38 - wow
02:43 - oh well
02:44 - um
02:46 - so we'll have to make do with this
02:47 - camera angle i'll try to remember to
02:49 - look
02:50 - uh over here
02:52 - if i can
02:54 - um
02:58 - but
03:00 - here let me i'm gonna have to sit in a
03:02 - different spot
03:03 - okay
03:04 - um
03:06 - all right so that camera and that's
03:08 - that's too big
03:10 - let's try to shrink that a bit
03:15 - maybe
03:19 - okay
03:20 - all right that looks
03:22 - better
03:24 - um
03:26 - okay cool so
03:28 - anyway i pasted the link to that getter
03:30 - channel
03:31 - uh in the
03:33 - in the live chat
03:35 - if i remember i'm gonna have to put that
03:37 - in the description i keep forgetting to
03:38 - do that
03:40 - but in case you're watching and you
03:41 - can't see the link you're maybe you're
03:43 - watching later on or uh just listening
03:46 - it's
03:47 - getter.i am
03:49 - slash live coding with jesse
03:54 - oh i'm sorry it's live coding with jesse
03:56 - free code camp so
03:59 - all of that
04:01 - all right and um
04:03 - just want to show you before we get
04:05 - started a project that one of you made
04:08 - so harshit who is
04:11 - a frequent contributor so i don't know
04:14 - what maybe for the last month or so very
04:16 - frequent contributor
04:18 - and uh so
04:20 - he has made a pomodoro timer you all
04:23 - know that i um
04:24 - that i use a pomodoro timer
04:28 - and
04:30 - i use the tomato timer well he's made
04:34 - the same functionality if not more than
04:36 - the tomato timer
04:38 - and he's done it in react with gatsby
04:41 - and then published it with now
04:44 - which uh if you're not familiar with now
04:46 - it's it's from the same people that made
04:49 - next uh
04:51 - js so i think it's i think it's zeit is
04:54 - the company anyway
04:57 - really really useful probably
05:01 - i can't really think of an easier way
05:05 - aside from github pages to deploy
05:08 - something get up pages is somewhat
05:10 - limited but
05:12 - now it's just a super super easy way to
05:15 - do it
05:16 - and
05:17 - anyway
05:18 - so if you haven't
05:20 - used that before i recommend it anyway
05:24 - uh so you can see pomodoro timer can
05:27 - start it stop it take long breaks reset
05:30 - right so it's pretty cool
05:32 - pretty cool so anyway thanks for sharing
05:34 - that hardship and also the uh repo is
05:38 - available
05:39 - um
05:41 - so
05:42 - everybody wants to check that out um
05:45 - pomodoro
05:47 - hyphen gatsby is the name of the
05:50 - repo but looks pretty cool the file that
05:53 - has most of the
05:56 - the most stuff going on is the timer.js
05:59 - so that's that's where all the
06:01 - the logic is i suppose anyway really
06:04 - cool so maybe uh let's use harshet's
06:06 - timer today
06:09 - shrink it down a bit
06:11 - and
06:12 - put it up here in the corner
06:15 - and since we've started here
06:17 - may as well get started we're going to
06:19 - do two pomodoro sessions today and then
06:22 - questions after
06:24 - um
06:26 - yeah we'll
06:28 - actually we'll see
06:30 - i need to be done
06:33 - in about an hour or so
06:36 - so i can go to a meeting
06:39 - and
06:41 - i keep forgetting that i'm on a
06:43 - different uh screen now
06:46 - let me see
06:49 - trying to let me aim this
06:52 - camera better there we go
06:54 - all right that's
06:56 - more centered
06:58 - okay
06:59 - um
07:11 - okay well i am getting a call so
07:14 - sorry about this hold on
07:17 - hello
07:19 - yes
17:30 - all right
17:31 - sorry about that
17:33 - uh
17:34 - now's a great time to
17:37 - give my disclaimer about this i haven't
17:40 - given this in a long time but
17:42 - live coding with jesse is all about
17:44 - showing what my day-to-day life is like
17:46 - as a front-end developer so mistakes
17:49 - included interruptions included
17:52 - so sometimes i will have somebody knock
17:54 - on my door at my office and i have to go
17:56 - talk to him or i'll get a phone call
17:59 - so
18:00 - that happens i really don't like
18:02 - when it's that long of a delay because
18:05 - that's no fun for for you all
18:08 - but
18:09 - is a good indication uh so
18:12 - i'm going to take a minute and just
18:13 - explain why i think
18:16 - this phone call was actually ended up
18:17 - being a good thing
18:19 - so that phone call
18:21 - which took
18:23 - i don't know 10 minutes maybe
18:26 - was all about the login system for the
18:28 - bulletin
18:30 - so
18:31 - one of the reasons why we're redoing the
18:34 - bulletin
18:35 - so we're redoing this and we have a new
18:39 - hopefully better login system and
18:41 - eventually we we may even tie it in with
18:43 - the single sign-on system for the
18:45 - university so it should be even better
18:48 - is because i get calls like that
18:52 - and trying to walk people through
18:54 - how to sign in in this case
18:57 - it was an old version of internet
18:59 - explorer that was the problem
19:02 - but then even when switching to chrome
19:04 - there was still some confusion
19:06 - and that's why it took so long
19:08 - so i think um
19:11 - my my co-worker here who is trying to
19:13 - access the bulletin can access it now
19:16 - but i'm still
19:18 - there there was some trouble so i'm
19:19 - still going to set up a time tomorrow or
19:22 - the next day to go over and check out
19:24 - her computer so you could see how a lot
19:27 - of my time ends up being spent
19:30 - on that that login so i think it
19:32 - definitely merits a
19:35 - a redo of the bulletin and this has been
19:37 - out for a year now
19:39 - uh just about a year
19:41 - and so for the whole year i've been
19:44 - you know getting these
19:46 - these types of calls so there were a lot
19:48 - more when it first came out so i'd say
19:50 - the first six months there were a lot
19:52 - more calls than this last six months but
19:55 - still
19:56 - um
19:57 - you know certainly interrupts the
19:58 - whatever i'm working on
20:00 - and
20:01 - and can take up a lot of a lot of time
20:04 - uh so
20:07 - anyway
20:09 - i guess the
20:11 - [Music]
20:12 - the
20:15 - the moral of the story is
20:18 - if you do things right the first time
20:20 - it'll save you a lot of time in the long
20:21 - run not that i did it wrong i don't
20:24 - think it's just i
20:26 - i guess at the time i didn't realize how
20:28 - many people on campus were using
20:30 - very old versions of browsers
20:34 - so
20:36 - that was
20:37 - most of the calls that i get the
20:38 - solution is simply well
20:42 - don't use internet explorer 8 anymore or
20:44 - something like that or firefox 4
20:47 - so anyway
20:52 - all right so let's um
20:56 - let's get started
21:02 - all right someone had said turn the mic
21:04 - on
21:07 - is you all can hear me now right i did
21:09 - turn the mic on
21:12 - um
21:18 - yeah i thought about leaving the mic on
21:20 - for that call but then i thought well
21:22 - maybe this person wouldn't want their
21:24 - conversation here but
21:26 - uh
21:27 - i actu i could have actually there is
21:29 - not really anything that
21:31 - i said that
21:33 - would have even given away
21:35 - uh
21:36 - any secrets you know
21:38 - okay cool okay so the mic my mic is on
21:41 - now so i just wanted to verify before i
21:43 - did anything important
21:49 - all right i tell you what next time i
21:51 - get a call if it's a call like that
21:54 - i'll turn the mic
21:56 - on
21:57 - and uh then you all can hear
22:00 - uh how i
22:03 - how i deal with um
22:05 - i guess troubleshooting
22:08 - uh issues over the phone
22:10 - all right so let's go in now
22:13 - and uh let's go into our code and figure
22:16 - out
22:17 - where this component is
22:20 - and let's try to get some of that
22:22 - functionality like i was explaining uh
22:24 - earlier
22:25 - so
22:28 - uh here in
22:30 - what is this at bar dot js
22:33 - and app.js.js
22:35 - we have
22:37 - we're bringing in this icon button
22:43 - and that's our search icon
22:46 - okay and then we have a
22:49 - handle search toggle
22:51 - okay and that happens
22:56 - when that happens let's see
23:04 - let's see if this
23:06 - handle search toggle there we go
23:08 - okay so here's where it comes up so
23:11 - if you're not familiar uh with this in
23:14 - react uh if you're not familiar with
23:16 - react at all or maybe you're just
23:17 - starting out with react
23:19 - one of the i think it's a cool thing but
23:21 - it's also can sometimes be a confusing
23:23 - thing is that you can actually pass up
23:26 - actions up to parent components
23:30 - and then have the functions
23:33 - that you'd like
23:34 - to be called on that action actually
23:36 - reside in an entirely different
23:38 - component and that's what we have going
23:40 - on here
23:41 - so we had
23:43 - in an app bar
23:46 - right we have on click
23:48 - handle search toggle but when we try to
23:51 - find handle search toggle
23:53 - right the only other place on the page
23:55 - where we have that is where we're
23:56 - passing in
23:58 - right all of this
24:01 - so
24:03 - and actually
24:06 - that might be is is that a style for
24:08 - search title
24:12 - or these are our profs
24:17 - i think actually these are our props
24:18 - okay
24:21 - so
24:23 - it's just a prop
24:24 - we need to go up to the parent component
24:26 - which in this case is index.js for our
24:29 - layout folder
24:31 - and
24:37 - we have
24:38 - you can see our top bar component
24:41 - so in our for our top bar component
24:46 - we're passing down
24:50 - right this function and
24:52 - let's see where we have
24:55 - handle
24:56 - [Music]
24:59 - handle search toggle so this is what
25:01 - really gets called even though it
25:03 - doesn't actually live in that um
25:06 - component
25:07 - um okay harsh destructuring that's the
25:10 - word for it
25:11 - uh i always forget that that's the word
25:13 - for it so when you break down the props
25:16 - like we just saw
25:17 - um so you don't basically you don't have
25:19 - to pre type in this props and then the
25:22 - prop name every single time it's really
25:24 - useful if you have a lot of props uh you
25:26 - can just
25:28 - destructure
25:30 - and
25:31 - have all the props get passed into the
25:33 - component you don't have to worry about
25:36 - using this props so
25:38 - uh
25:40 - very useful but here's basically what
25:43 - what happens and this is really what we
25:45 - want to um what we want to work on
25:49 - so
25:52 - we change the
25:55 - styles for
25:58 - our search icon and our search styles
26:04 - let's see so
26:06 - let's check out our
26:08 - state here's our search styles search
26:12 - icon styles
26:14 - so
26:16 - in this case
26:17 - this says
26:26 - so we start out with
26:29 - display non-display block okay
26:32 - and
26:36 - let's let's go back let's let's see it
26:39 - in action all right so
26:42 - we're going to inspect now i have
26:44 - um
26:46 - the react dev tools
26:53 - there we go
26:55 - okay
26:56 - so
26:57 - with our dev tools let's go to this
26:59 - component which was okay this was our
27:01 - index component
27:03 - so we should be able to go
27:06 - can we go top bar
27:10 - oh no we want to go up
27:19 - state
27:22 - there we go
27:23 - okay so here's is our state right now so
27:26 - hopefully you can see that over here in
27:27 - the corner let me make sure i'm not
27:28 - covering it up okay i'm not all right so
27:31 - just check this out so in real time we
27:34 - can see what our state is
27:36 - on that
27:37 - that top component all right it's not
27:40 - in terms of the layout folder it's the
27:42 - root component
27:44 - so we can see our search icon styles and
27:47 - then our search styles
27:49 - okay and we can watch them change
27:51 - actually i should
27:53 - uh
27:55 - let's see if i can get him to change by
27:57 - clicking
27:58 - there we go
27:59 - okay
28:00 - so
28:05 - let's
28:06 - inspect
28:08 - again and go to
28:11 - correct
28:12 - i have to go down a bit
28:17 - oh yeah
28:20 - am i too far down
28:22 - route
28:24 - stay
28:26 - all right let's go back to the
28:28 - it was home page
28:29 - simpler there
28:31 - okay
28:33 - there we go it's fine apollo
28:38 - home
28:46 - yeah there we go so we're in layout i
28:49 - probably could have found it on the
28:50 - other one i just wasn't patient enough
28:51 - to click through
28:53 - uh if anybody knows of an easier way to
28:55 - open all this stuff and get down to a
28:57 - component let me know
28:59 - is search the the only way that's really
29:02 - easy to
29:03 - do that i know i've i have used a search
29:05 - before
29:06 - but
29:09 - i mean i guess i could find it down here
29:11 - oh well um
29:13 - okay so now let's let's see the change
29:15 - happen
29:17 - so right now search icon styles this
29:19 - display block search styles display none
29:22 - and then when we click this
29:24 - right they flip okay so
29:28 - that's that's how we do that transition
29:30 - in in react right
29:33 - um so
29:37 - let's see
29:39 - let's go back here
29:42 - and
29:48 - let's go to
29:52 - first thing we need to do i guess is put
29:54 - in those elements that we want right no
29:56 - sense in putting in a new state and
29:59 - everything if
30:00 - there's nothing for it to change
30:04 - see gps icon
30:06 - so let me check this
30:09 - where are we at
30:10 - top left okay
30:16 - this is
30:22 - is this what you are talking about
30:26 - this icon select the rack element in the
30:28 - page to inspect it
30:32 - cool and it takes you right to it
30:35 - i like that
30:37 - cool i never knew that awesome
30:39 - thanks for the advice uh harshit and
30:42 - john
30:43 - that's really cool so if you want to
30:45 - just be able to click something and go
30:47 - right to it and
30:49 - react
30:50 - you can click the target
30:53 - and then
30:55 - let's go up to here this one and then
30:58 - click right on that element and it'll
31:00 - take you right to it
31:02 - really cool
31:05 - let's see
31:08 - okay so let's go into our
31:12 - at bar dot js
31:16 - and now we want to
31:20 - we want to add in
31:28 - we need to add in a close
31:31 - icon
31:35 - and we're going to need to change some
31:36 - of the styles for the search icon
31:39 - okay
31:40 - so let me see
31:43 - switch please
31:56 - okay my timer ran out uh thanks for
31:58 - reminding me to check the timer so
32:00 - um so any so harsh it on on your timer i
32:04 - guess you don't have a sound
32:06 - i wasn't prompted to allow
32:09 - allow sounds or anything
32:12 - or allow notifications
32:17 - yeah so i didn't hear any audio it's
32:19 - possible that i just i missed it i
32:21 - wasn't paying attention
32:23 - um
32:24 - but uh
32:26 - okay so let's take a short break right
32:28 - now
32:29 - um
32:30 - in between coding sessions we take a
32:32 - five minute break and i go in the live
32:34 - chat and answer questions and then at
32:35 - the end i answer anything that i wasn't
32:38 - able to get to
32:39 - in our little five minute session so
32:43 - let me scroll through
32:46 - and
32:48 - let's see
32:54 - oh rob was able to make it uh awesome
32:57 - so
32:58 - i'm really glad that you could make it
33:00 - um rob had commented earlier on one of
33:03 - the videos about not not being able to
33:05 - make it for the live uh stream so
33:08 - really awesome that you you did get to
33:10 - make it
33:12 - uh let's see
33:25 - oh okay so on harsh it's
33:28 - i'm assuming with the pomodoro clock
33:29 - you're talking about uh has a bug with
33:32 - github pages that it it redirects um
33:37 - to the main page
33:39 - uh redirects request the main profile
33:41 - which causes conflicts
33:43 - okay
33:44 - yeah there are actually i there is a
33:47 - it's a little weird
33:48 - when you're trying to use some some
33:51 - types of things with like some types of
33:54 - sites with github pages
33:56 - i've had some issues before i
33:59 - i believe i've found some workarounds
34:03 - for that
34:07 - but um
34:08 - yeah it's not 100 straightforward
34:18 - let's see her should ask if anyone has
34:19 - ever has tried firefox developer edition
34:22 - says it's really very cool i actually
34:24 - haven't i haven't tried that so
34:27 - maybe i'll have to try that out
34:35 - okay so uh anthony asks what are the
34:37 - topics on this live stream and uh some
34:40 - of the responses where material ui and
34:42 - react node.js
34:44 - um
34:46 - express
34:48 - yeah yeah definitely i mean that pretty
34:50 - much covers it um but i guess we use
34:53 - create react app to
34:55 - you know scaffold the thing but
34:57 - um other than that i think that does
34:59 - cover everything eventually when we make
35:01 - this live uh it's gonna sit behind um
35:04 - engine x acting as a reverse proxy so
35:08 - we may do
35:09 - a little bit of configuration with nginx
35:11 - but just very minimal
35:26 - let's see
35:28 - uh josh modian says do you use visual
35:30 - studio code i do use visual studio code
35:33 - sometimes
35:35 - did i never actually start this
35:38 - no i didn't
35:43 - uh oh
35:44 - i did something
35:49 - okay now it's working i mean obviously
35:51 - i've already taken up several minutes
35:53 - but
35:54 - um
36:06 - okay cool harsh is saying we just
36:07 - swapped the displays yeah i just i kind
36:09 - of wanted to show um show it like in the
36:13 - react dev tools just
36:15 - number one just in case somebody's never
36:17 - used them
36:18 - uh but then also just to get the idea
36:21 - for people coming from like a um like a
36:24 - jquery mentality
36:26 - more to react that
36:28 - like we're not
36:30 - we're not directly manipulating the
36:32 - stuff on the page like we're changing
36:33 - state and then based on that state react
36:35 - does its thing so
36:37 - um i know when i was first starting with
36:41 - react that was
36:42 - a shift like i i had to get used to that
36:45 - so
36:46 - anyway so i mean hopefully it was it was
36:49 - helpful
37:03 - uh josh rhodey and what program do you
37:05 - use oh um right now i'm using adam as my
37:09 - editor
37:33 - uh joshua says what do you mainly use i
37:36 - mainly use adam so right right now
37:38 - adam's my primary editor and then
37:41 - sometimes visual studio code
37:44 - uh so i i keep thinking about switching
37:47 - to being having visual studio code be my
37:50 - primary one i just haven't made that
37:52 - switch yet
37:53 - um so
37:55 - it's possibility it might happen
38:02 - let's see
38:03 - okay so i've gotten through everything
38:05 - in the live chat right now and i've
38:07 - probably gone over my five minutes at
38:09 - this point i'm not sure because
38:11 - this this isn't the
38:13 - the right time
38:14 - so uh i'm gonna go back now
38:19 - okay so it's about nine minutes after 2
38:21 - p.m
38:22 - my time
38:24 - uh so
38:27 - yeah so let's do one
38:31 - i guess we'll try to get in one more
38:32 - pomodoro session
38:40 - um
38:46 - okay
38:48 - uh
38:50 - let's go back here and
38:53 - okay so we need to bring in a search
38:55 - icon or i'm sorry a close icon
38:59 - uh where are we bringing in our icons
39:01 - okay
39:06 - let's just import another one here
39:10 - and i'm just gonna guess and say close
39:18 - and we'll see if it works if anybody
39:20 - else happens to know what the real name
39:22 - is let me know otherwise we might be
39:24 - able to save a few minutes by just
39:26 - putting that in and uh
39:29 - let's see
39:32 - oh we have one more question so matt
39:34 - matt
39:36 - correct me if i'm pronouncing this wrong
39:38 - is it matija
39:40 - or matija i don't know uh let me know i
39:42 - really want to get it right so jesse
39:44 - will wrap you here in the future what do
39:45 - you personally think
39:47 - um if if by future you mean the next
39:50 - like three years
39:53 - one to three years then yes definitely
39:56 - if we're talking more like
39:58 - five years
40:00 - probably
40:01 - uh but five to ten years
40:04 - who knows right i mean it's that's just
40:06 - in computer time it's just way
40:09 - um
40:10 - way too long
40:13 - so
40:14 - harsh is saying reload the timer page i
40:16 - did
40:17 - i reloaded it and started again oh you
40:19 - know what maybe it's the delay in the
40:21 - video so you might be seeing
40:23 - you might not have seen it yet so
40:25 - uh sorry about that
40:28 - let's see
40:30 - i lost my train of thought oh okay we
40:31 - have that icon so let's throw this icon
40:33 - in
40:35 - and
40:40 - [Music]
40:42 - now we're just gonna see if this this
40:45 - even does anything if it even works
40:50 - so yep it did great so it was named
40:54 - close awesome okay so we now have that
40:57 - close icon and the search icon we don't
40:59 - want the close icon to be visible by
41:01 - default though
41:03 - so what we need to do
41:06 - let's see how we're doing this style
41:08 - switch icon styles
41:12 - and then we have
41:21 - okay it was matia
41:23 - awesome
41:26 - i'm glad i got it right
41:30 - uh all right
41:32 - and that goes for anybody if ever if i
41:34 - ever pronounce any of your names wrong
41:35 - please uh call me out on it let me know
41:43 - all right so
41:45 - sorry for kind of looking around on this
41:47 - harshit actually made this part i
41:49 - believe yeah you did the search right
41:51 - harshi
41:52 - um so harsha did this so
41:55 - i've seen this only once whenever i
41:58 - reviewed the pull request
42:00 - and that was a little while ago
42:04 - should apply input styles
42:07 - see an input okay
42:09 - um
42:14 - yeah
42:15 - where's our input
42:19 - here it is
42:24 - search styles
42:26 - okay
42:28 - so let's go
42:32 - can i throw this style right let's try
42:34 - to throw it right on the icon
42:38 - oh okay so matthias uh it's croatian
42:42 - okay cool
42:46 - i don't think i've had any experience
42:47 - with uh with croatian before
42:50 - so uh
42:51 - that's really it's really cool
42:53 - um
42:55 - style
42:57 - okay so
42:58 - i i know i've said this before but in
43:00 - case you you haven't been around or
43:02 - you know to hear this there are many
43:04 - ways to handle styles in react so this
43:07 - is one of the ways that we're doing it
43:10 - we're passing around styles like they're
43:12 - variables uh we're bringing them into
43:14 - our components so we certainly could
43:16 - style with regular css like we're doing
43:19 - here
43:20 - all right but we're choosing to do it
43:22 - another way
43:23 - and um
43:24 - i don't know that it's settled
43:27 - that there is a number one best way to
43:29 - do styles yet and react it's still
43:32 - kind of wide open so
43:34 - um which is fun it's it's fun we get to
43:37 - try a lot of different things
43:40 - there's a lot of different opinions on
43:42 - on how to do it search icon style nope
43:46 - that's not what i wanted i wanted search
43:48 - styles
43:50 - there we go
43:51 - all right let's save that we'll go back
43:53 - here and
43:55 - check it out we should see yep we see
43:57 - that let's open it
44:00 - okay and we now have i believe
44:02 - conflicting
44:03 - styles so let's
44:06 - let's actually remove this it makes
44:08 - sense to remove this
44:11 - and
44:12 - you know what let's just
44:14 - let's copy all of this
44:18 - all right and
44:22 - put it here
44:25 - and
44:26 - what we want
44:27 - is to change this to
44:30 - search styles
44:32 - and
44:34 - i'm going to leave this on click for now
44:41 - but we we may end up changing that
44:44 - and then we're going to add our close
44:46 - icon here
44:50 - and let me get rid of some of this space
44:52 - because it just annoys me
44:55 - and um
44:58 - there we go oops that's all right okay
45:02 - all right so let's check out uh what it
45:04 - looks like now
45:07 - we should be able to see the close icon
45:10 - yes we can all right the placement of
45:12 - that icon is actually not bad
45:14 - i had envisioned it as
45:17 - being
45:18 - on the line here so i guess within the
45:21 - input
45:23 - but
45:25 - that works
45:26 - and we can certainly take care of that
45:29 - as well
45:30 - with a little bit of positioning
45:34 - um
45:35 - yeah but for now just trying to get the
45:37 - functionality what we want to happen
45:39 - when we click that oh is it already in
45:41 - there
45:42 - yes
45:44 - i wondered if that would happen
45:47 - i i was hopeful i didn't want to say it
45:49 - because i didn't want to sound
45:52 - even more like i don't know what i'm
45:53 - talking about
45:54 - uh but
45:57 - i was hopeful that the way harshit made
46:00 - the
46:01 - handle search toggle
46:04 - that it would just
46:06 - do the opposite right of the styles
46:08 - which is
46:09 - exactly what he did so that was awesome
46:13 - and look at that so this is the
46:14 - functionality that we want
46:16 - the only other thing that i'm thinking
46:18 - about and i'm not sure about but let me
46:19 - run it by you all and let me know what
46:21 - you think
46:22 - um
46:23 - previously on some of my projects i've
46:25 - included a search icon
46:27 - sometimes on this side sometimes on this
46:30 - side i can't remember which which side i
46:33 - usually do but i include a search icon
46:36 - uh my thinking being
46:39 - uh
46:40 - someone may
46:43 - want to click especially on mobile maybe
46:45 - they would prefer to to try to click
46:48 - some sort of icon
46:51 - do you think that's a reasonable
46:54 - um
46:56 - do you think it's a reasonable thing to
46:57 - think or
46:59 - am i just trying to build in things that
47:01 - are unnecessary here
47:03 - um
47:05 - i uh
47:06 - i want to hear what you all think
47:08 - because
47:11 - i wouldn't want to add anything into the
47:13 - ui and add functionality that is not
47:15 - going to improve what we have
47:18 - right then it just complicates things so
47:20 - i
47:21 - i'm
47:22 - kind of really
47:23 - lean towards minimalistic you know is
47:25 - that everything there should have a
47:27 - purpose
47:28 - it for being there and it should be
47:30 - useful to the user
47:32 - so um
47:35 - anyway
47:36 - uh so i'll um i'll just keep checking
47:39 - the live chat to see if anyone has any
47:41 - um any input
47:45 - let's see
47:48 - okay so
47:50 - dessal rollo de serolo
47:54 - uh says
47:56 - i think it's not necessary okay
48:00 - actually let me change before i forget i
48:02 - just forgot to change the title
48:04 - for this uh
48:06 - oops
48:08 - um
48:10 - this is gonna be
48:13 - close
48:20 - search
48:24 - close search
48:25 - yeah
48:28 - let's do
48:30 - let's say close search
48:32 - um
48:33 - i would i would much rather be more
48:35 - specific here i don't i don't want
48:37 - anyone thinking that if they click it it
48:39 - would close everything out
48:41 - uh because you know we we do have a lot
48:43 - of people that uh that view the bulletin
48:45 - that are
48:46 - very unfamiliar with computers so i'd
48:49 - like to be as
48:51 - specific as i can
48:53 - actually now what i think about it
48:57 - i want to change the font size for those
48:58 - tool tips
49:00 - because the people who really need those
49:02 - tooltips
49:04 - probably also need larger font sizes so
49:07 - we'll have to look up in uh material ui
49:11 - if they've already thought of some way
49:12 - like to pass a prop or something if not
49:15 - we can just change it with css
49:17 - but i really i think it could be
49:20 - be a little
49:21 - larger
49:23 - okay let's see
49:26 - definitely
49:29 - oh okay so blake's in favor of the
49:31 - search icon
49:35 - oh okay rook rook mentions uh auto focus
49:39 - on the search bar that's a great idea
49:49 - let's see
49:51 - okay john hanson says mobile logic for
49:53 - ui can be tricky only way to really know
49:56 - if a button or icon to click
50:00 - for a function is by using something
50:02 - like google tag manager actually yeah i
50:04 - mean we could
50:07 - we could put click handlers
50:11 - uh um
50:12 - click tracking
50:16 - on there just to see we put uh on that
50:18 - resource center project that we we did
50:20 - before this
50:21 - i put uh click tracking
50:24 - i think i did it it could have been
50:26 - somebody a pull request if so uh sorry
50:28 - i've i i'm not giving you credit here um
50:31 - but i think i put click tracking through
50:34 - google analytics on everything and it
50:35 - was pretty simple
50:37 - um actually i was just checking the
50:39 - analytics
50:40 - earlier today and we got a lot of good
50:42 - data on clicks and things
50:45 - uh
50:46 - our says will you set up analytics
50:48 - for this yeah we'll definitely set up
50:50 - analytics for this so my the head of my
50:52 - department has to go to
50:54 - sometimes to the president of the the
50:56 - college the president university or just
50:59 - in general like the board
51:01 - and
51:02 - report on how these websites are doing
51:05 - so she really likes to have data like
51:08 - this like how many people clicked to
51:09 - download this and how many people went
51:11 - here right so
51:14 - so i always try to
51:17 - give as much data as i can sometimes i
51:20 - never use the data but it's good if i
51:22 - have it if she comes into my office and
51:24 - says hey i got a meeting in 10 minutes
51:26 - can i have this data then i have it and
51:29 - it makes me look good and it makes her
51:30 - look good so
51:32 - we're definitely going to do
51:34 - analytics right so auto focus search
51:37 - icon autofocus tricky sometimes before
51:39 - you scroll ahead somewhere you don't
51:41 - want
51:43 - add placeholder
51:46 - okay all right so we have a a lot of
51:48 - good ideas let me try to get them all
51:49 - here and just explain it so
51:52 - uh a placeholder when you open this up
51:56 - that definitely makes sense
51:58 - i have a placeholder here i like that
52:01 - we have some conflicting opinions on
52:03 - whether or not we should put a search
52:04 - icon in there so let's save that for
52:07 - last we may not even have time to do it
52:10 - no matter what uh for today's stream but
52:12 - let's save that for last since we're
52:13 - still
52:14 - somewhat undecided on it
52:17 - and then also we're talking about auto
52:19 - focus which there's some discussion
52:21 - about auto focus as well
52:23 - because
52:25 - it can mess up the scroll sometimes
52:28 - i really do like the idea of auto focus
52:31 - because you know you have to click you
52:33 - click search and then you have to click
52:34 - here
52:36 - i i tell you what i'm going to go with
52:39 - auto focus but i'm going to keep in mind
52:41 - when we're testing
52:42 - and try to make sure that it's not
52:44 - messing up the scroll
52:47 - but i
52:48 - i know i would really appreciate in auto
52:51 - focus because if i'm clicking that
52:53 - search icon i want to search
52:55 - so auto focus would be great
52:58 - so let's do that let's
53:00 - so we'll do two things for sure
53:03 - assuming we have time we'll set up auto
53:05 - focus on click
53:08 - and then we will
53:10 - put in some placeholder text there okay
53:14 - let's see and i actually want to
53:17 - i may just check this out on my other
53:19 - screen quickly
53:22 - i just want to look at what the search
53:24 - thing looks like currently on the
53:25 - current bulletin and it looks like
53:29 - okay we actually do let me let me just
53:31 - show you this now i guess
53:33 - so in the current bulletin
53:35 - when you click the search icon
53:38 - so we actually
53:39 - we change the entire
53:41 - uh nav to the search but we do actually
53:44 - have a search icon
53:46 - and a close i wonder
53:50 - you know what
53:51 - i think my search icon isn't even
53:53 - clickable
53:57 - i don't think it's clickable
54:00 - so i think if we just put a placeholder
54:01 - that says search
54:03 - that'll be fine
54:05 - i don't think we need the icon now
54:07 - we do obviously include the close but
54:10 - the search happens
54:12 - when the user stops typing or sometimes
54:14 - even as they're typing depending on how
54:15 - fast they're typing so
54:19 - i just want it to be familiar to the
54:21 - users who are used to that search so the
54:24 - look of it is going to be slightly
54:25 - different because we're not going with
54:27 - this huge
54:28 - search bar that changes the whole nav
54:31 - but i'd like the functionality to be
54:34 - you know identical if possible if not at
54:36 - least as close as possible
54:38 - just to make the transition
54:41 - you know a little bit more smooth
54:44 - all right so let's add
54:47 - where's our text field
54:50 - let's see if we can just say placeholder
54:52 - i don't know
54:59 - i don't know what it is for material ui
55:02 - um which is the the ui framework that
55:04 - we're using
55:06 - but let's try placeholder because that
55:08 - makes sense
55:10 - if it works then we don't have to look
55:11 - it up and save some time
55:21 - yay that works okay so we have the
55:23 - placeholder it goes away
55:25 - when you type perfect and it comes back
55:28 - we don't type excellent all right that
55:30 - was a great idea i think it was hardship
55:32 - that had the idea for the placeholder so
55:34 - awesome
55:37 - um
55:38 - let's see
55:41 - so that was easy it didn't take very
55:43 - much time what was the other
55:45 - autofocus so autofocus may take a bit
55:49 - more time i don't know that i've ever
55:50 - done auto focus and react no i take that
55:52 - back i did
55:54 - i have done it before but it's been
55:57 - i think i did it in
55:58 - march so it's been quite a while so i
56:01 - will have to look that up
56:07 - so let me
56:09 - i'll look this up
56:13 - and
56:19 - all right let's see
56:20 - let me see if anyone has anything to say
56:25 - about the autofocus
56:27 - okay if anyone has implemented autofocus
56:30 - recently in react uh any help would be
56:33 - appreciated otherwise i'm going to try
56:34 - to look it up
56:35 - um
56:36 - let's see also he said uh so we have now
56:40 - let me know if i'm pronouncing your name
56:42 - wrong because it's written in characters
56:43 - i'm not familiar with
56:45 - so i'm arabic i think
56:48 - but is it uh
56:50 - ibrahim
56:52 - so let me know if that's wrong but i
56:54 - think it's ibrahim
56:56 - um but like i said the characters are in
56:59 - arabic so i i could definitely be
57:01 - mistaken but anyway abraham says i love
57:03 - your channel it's very active
57:06 - uh and then have a heart on there so
57:08 - awesome i'm really glad you you love the
57:10 - channel
57:11 - and uh thanks for watching and joining
57:13 - in in the live chat
57:17 - okay so harshit says we could just make
57:19 - a ref and call focus on click
57:26 - oh okay
57:28 - rook that's a that's a good idea so
57:30 - harshit's suggestion will definitely
57:32 - work
57:33 - rook has another idea that could save us
57:35 - a lot of time uh auto focus as a prop so
57:38 - let's try to put autofocus as a prop on
57:40 - the search bar rook saying because it
57:43 - only appears when you click the search
57:44 - icon it should be fine right um
57:47 - yeah
57:49 - yeah you're right it should be fine
57:50 - because it it won't exist in the dom at
57:53 - all until you click so there's no real
57:57 - danger of it accidentally being auto
57:59 - focused and not visible all right let's
58:01 - try that
58:09 - all right
58:11 - it could work it's it's such an easy fix
58:13 - it's worth a try even if it doesn't work
58:16 - okay so it didn't work
58:18 - um but still
58:22 - that was good thinking though
58:29 - uh eunice says how did you learn arabic
58:32 - i didn't google translate learned arabic
58:36 - so
58:38 - i just think it's polite to try to
58:40 - figure out someone's name even if i
58:42 - don't know the characters so
58:44 - um
58:46 - i know for me it would i would feel good
58:49 - if somebody took the time to do that so
58:51 - anyway so i think it's worth it so on my
58:53 - other screen i google translated it so
58:56 - unfortunately i i don't know arabic
58:59 - um
59:01 - oh harsh it you're right you're right um
59:04 - my mistake i missed i mistakenly said
59:07 - that this wouldn't exist
59:09 - but it in fact it does because
59:12 - um
59:13 - the way harsh it made it it's it's only
59:15 - using display none it's not actually
59:18 - um
59:19 - removing a component so my mistake i
59:23 - usually do stuff like that uh where i i
59:27 - make the components actually
59:29 - completely be gone you know be rendered
59:32 - or not rendered based on on the prop so
59:35 - anyway
59:37 - so yeah so
59:39 - that might be an issue
59:42 - but let's try i guess
59:45 - i guess it's worth the shot just to
59:47 - check material ui
59:50 - and see if they have some built-in way
59:52 - of handling something like this
59:55 - it could save us some time
59:57 - um
60:00 - let's try it out
60:02 - text
60:03 - field
60:10 - let's see
60:12 - that's what we're using right
60:15 - text field yes okay
60:20 - auto focus oh okay um
60:26 - cool
60:26 - so autofocus does work
60:29 - we just needed to camel case it
60:32 - so
60:37 - let's see
60:39 - let's try this again
60:46 - auto focus
60:57 - you know what that's not going to work
60:59 - because it auto focuses when the
61:01 - component mounts but then i'm clicking
61:03 - away
61:04 - so that should that will undo the focus
61:07 - so
61:08 - actually let's let's see i wonder if
61:11 - this will work
61:15 - no it didn't i was wondering if when i
61:17 - typed it would actually go in here
61:20 - um
61:20 - even before so let's
61:23 - let's switch this up a bit
61:25 - um
61:27 - no i'm not gonna have time for this
61:29 - shoot
61:30 - okay
61:30 - so
61:32 - in case i don't do this on the stream
61:35 - and i do it before tomorrow stream um
61:38 - actually i'm not going to stream
61:39 - tomorrow i'll give you more info about
61:41 - that in a second
61:43 - i'm not going to have enough time before
61:45 - my meeting to implement this but here's
61:46 - my plan
61:48 - right now
61:50 - when you do handle search toggle when
61:52 - when you click uh a button that fires
61:55 - off handle search toggle it's just
61:57 - changing uh the css from display block
62:00 - to display none
62:02 - you know back and forth
62:04 - what i want to have happen
62:07 - instead
62:10 - is that this text field
62:13 - actually renders
62:17 - on you know on uh on click so what we'll
62:20 - end up having
62:22 - and we'll have to pass down
62:25 - let's see
62:28 - we'll have to change up a little bit
62:29 - about what's going on with our state and
62:31 - then make sure we pass it down like
62:32 - we're doing with these search styles
62:36 - and then we're going to have to adjust
62:37 - our handle search toggle function that
62:40 - resides in our index.js within our
62:43 - layout folder
62:45 - but the end result is going to be that
62:47 - we're going to end up having some sort
62:49 - of uh ternary
62:51 - that is going to check the state
62:53 - which the state and might end up being
62:56 - like show show search um input or
62:59 - something which would just be a boolean
63:01 - and
63:02 - so we'll end up having something like
63:08 - show search
63:10 - um
63:14 - and then if we are showing search
63:17 - we'll put
63:20 - all of that in here
63:22 - right we'll show this
63:24 - otherwise we'll show this so actually i
63:25 - won't do it like this i'll end up doing
63:27 - it like
63:28 - uh
63:29 - question mark
63:31 - okay i am hearing the beeping sound now
63:34 - so my pomodoro session is up and then
63:37 - we'll put
63:38 - this in
63:41 - i actually might have time to do this uh
63:44 - so this is what'll end up happening
63:46 - and
63:48 - so right now
63:51 - it's going to break because i don't
63:53 - actually have so
63:55 - show search being passed down as a prop
63:58 - but what we'll end up doing is
64:01 - in index
64:03 - we'll add
64:11 - show search by default it's going to be
64:16 - false
64:19 - okay so
64:21 - and then
64:22 - where we have our
64:24 - top bar we're going to pass on
64:29 - so show search
64:32 - equals
64:34 - this dot state dot
64:37 - show search
64:39 - and then now
64:44 - what's this video
64:50 - uh tool to title a closed search
64:55 - uh we gotta wrap it
64:57 - um
64:59 - yes we can't have this so let's just
65:00 - wrap this in a div
65:07 - oops
65:11 - and this should be good yeah
65:14 - sure it's just not defined and i didn't
65:16 - bring it in here so let's let's
65:18 - destructure a little bit here
65:22 - show search
65:24 - all right now it should work
65:32 - okay
65:34 - so we had something happen which i'm
65:36 - going to take as a win right now since i
65:38 - just
65:39 - tried to do that as fast as i possibly
65:41 - could
65:42 - um
65:46 - yeah which should happen so this is
65:49 - search
65:58 - yeah i don't know what went wrong but i
65:59 - don't have time to check it out right
66:00 - now but you can see basically the the
66:02 - concept that i'm trying to go for
66:05 - um and the reason being i think we could
66:08 - get this auto focus to work
66:11 - if
66:12 - um
66:15 - if we can have this actually
66:18 - this component render
66:20 - when you click the search icon
66:23 - because i believe this auto focus fires
66:26 - when the component mounts
66:28 - so we want to delay the mounting until
66:30 - the user actually clicks on that icon
66:34 - so anyway
66:35 - that's the idea
66:37 - obviously something's weird about it
66:39 - right now since it's not showing at all
66:42 - but we'll get that fixed it could be
66:44 - something as simple as wrapping it in a
66:46 - div somehow change the styles
66:49 - not sure
66:50 - okay
66:51 - uh let me try
66:54 - quickly to go through the live chat
66:56 - and answer all your
66:58 - questions and let's see
67:04 - i'm
67:05 - trying to find where i left off
67:23 - okay so hardship has pasted a link to a
67:27 - gist
67:28 - that's has a debate
67:30 - about
67:34 - css uh and react and and how to use it
67:38 - so
67:39 - anyway it looks really really helpful
67:41 - let's check
67:42 - and bring it over here
67:44 - so
67:48 - i'll i'll paste the link
67:50 - in the chat as well so it's clickable
67:52 - for you all
67:54 - it's way too long of a link for me to
67:56 - actually read out to anybody that that
67:58 - can't see the live chat so sorry for
68:00 - that
68:01 - um
68:03 - if someone wants to put in a comment to
68:05 - the video that would be awesome
68:07 - um
68:08 - i'll make sure it gets approved a lot of
68:10 - times uh if you try to paste a link in a
68:12 - comment to a video it gets
68:14 - flagged as spam but i'll go in and
68:16 - approve it
68:18 - okay so look at all the different
68:23 - ways to do this so
68:25 - really cool
68:26 - thanks for sharing that harshit
68:32 - uh
68:34 - abstract cats says this seems like a
68:37 - cool learn session as well
68:40 - for those of us just learning i started
68:41 - learning web design about 10 years ago
68:43 - and got distracted but now going full
68:45 - steam ahead awesome
68:47 - awesome that's that that kind of sounds
68:50 - like like me as well um
68:53 - i learned uh
68:54 - some some web development in um in high
68:58 - school
68:59 - and then didn't really do that much with
69:01 - it
69:02 - until
69:03 - too much later on
69:05 - so i'm trying to think
69:07 - actually 10 years might be it might be
69:09 - about the same 10 years so
69:12 - uh yeah well hopefully you learn stuff i
69:14 - do my best to try to explain things that
69:16 - i think might be confusing to people who
69:18 - are just starting out or not familiar
69:20 - with react so you know i don't always
69:22 - i'm sure i i just skip over some things
69:24 - and don't realize that it's i should
69:26 - probably explain but when i when i
69:28 - remember i really uh try to explain as
69:31 - well as i can
69:34 - please
69:56 - all right let's see
70:04 - i'm scrolling through the chat here
70:06 - there's not a whole lot of questions
70:07 - there's a lot of um a lot of stuff i
70:10 - already kind of went over when we were
70:11 - um
70:12 - kind of going back and forth trying to
70:14 - find solutions to this auto focus thing
70:28 - josh modian says for the closed search
70:30 - you could try to make it so that when
70:31 - the user clicks off it closes
70:34 - um
70:37 - yeah yeah definitely i think that's um
70:40 - i actually have thought about that
70:45 - i'm gonna think when i was thinking
70:47 - about it earlier and uh i there was some
70:50 - reason why i thought maybe i shouldn't
70:51 - do it and i can't remember now
70:56 - i can't believe i can't remember i've
70:57 - just tried to think about it but that's
70:59 - that's actually not a bad idea
71:03 - um
71:06 - let's see
71:14 - oh harsha said it it should have played
71:15 - the audio it did it did play the audio
71:17 - this time so that that pomodoro timer i
71:20 - i heard it
71:22 - um
71:26 - oh okay john b says try auto focus true
71:31 - i could try that yeah i mean i
71:33 - i assumed that i could just put it in
71:35 - there and it would automatically be true
71:38 - um
71:39 - usually you can do that
71:41 - uh
71:42 - okay yeah so
71:45 - maybe uh um
71:48 - i'll try that out
71:50 - probably sometime tomorrow
71:52 - um
71:54 - let's see immediately
72:00 - i click a post
72:02 - all right harsha says commit this
72:06 - pr immediately so have you did you
72:08 - submit a pull request now
72:16 - no
72:19 - let's see what time it is okay
72:22 - um
72:23 - philip says i haven't started i started
72:26 - learning javascript but went probably
72:28 - too fast since i missed a lot of the
72:30 - vanilla javascript
72:32 - um
72:35 - but i work full-time with react now
72:37 - should i fill my missing basic
72:40 - javascript knowledge
72:41 - um
72:44 - yeah i i think it's it's always good to
72:47 - have a good knowledge of of javascript
72:50 - um
72:52 - so if you
72:54 - if you can get your work done and it's
72:56 - good work then i wouldn't make it you
72:59 - know a huge priority to fill that in
73:01 - but it might not be a bad idea to just
73:04 - go through some of the basics a little
73:06 - bit every day
73:07 - even if it's only a few minutes
73:11 - i think that
73:12 - you know that would be good because you
73:14 - never know react is is certainly
73:16 - relevant now and i think it will be for
73:19 - at least a few more years but you never
73:22 - know what will happen in the future and
73:23 - the more
73:24 - javascript plain vanilla javascript you
73:26 - know
73:27 - uh the better you'll be able to adapt to
73:30 - any javascript based system that that
73:33 - comes up
73:34 - uh so
73:36 - yeah so probably don't need to learn it
73:38 - right now you know not this month or not
73:40 - even this year but if you do a little
73:42 - bit at a time you i think you'll set
73:43 - yourself up to
73:45 - be able to
73:46 - to adapt uh to changes and make sure
73:49 - that you know you could still do good
73:51 - work
73:52 - uh no matter what happens
73:55 - oh okay how should i get it harsh is
73:57 - saying i should commit this okay cool um
74:03 - yeah let me commit this then and
74:06 - um
74:07 - then i'm gonna have to wrap things up
74:08 - because i have to go to my meeting
74:10 - but
74:26 - um okay that looks good
74:29 - tomorrow i'm not gonna stream so i was
74:32 - looking at my calendar earlier and uh i
74:35 - just have so many meetings tomorrow
74:38 - uh that
74:39 - in and they're spaced out so that i have
74:42 - like an hour between meetings
74:44 - so
74:46 - there's not really a great time
74:48 - for me to uh to do a stream i mean the
74:51 - only possibility would be if somehow i
74:53 - got into work really early and then did
74:55 - a morning stream
74:57 - i don't think that's gonna happen
74:59 - um
75:01 - so on the off chance that i do get in
75:03 - really early maybe i'll do that
75:05 - otherwise most likely not gonna stream
75:07 - but wednesday is looking good for a
75:09 - stream i currently have no meetings
75:11 - scheduled
75:13 - so
75:14 - i think wednesday's like
75:18 - nearly for sure there's going to be a
75:19 - stream
75:20 - unless something weird happens but
75:22 - tomorrow probably no stream
75:26 - uh and if there is one it will probably
75:28 - be in early morning eastern time
75:33 - so
75:34 - anyway i have to go
75:36 - take
75:43 - okay
75:46 - harsha just said get push origin master
75:51 - thanks
75:52 - i i may have forgotten that actually
75:58 - i probably would have just immediately
75:59 - gone right to my meeting and forgotten
76:01 - to push that so
76:03 - um
76:08 - oh cool um all right gideon's back uh so
76:12 - gideon says been away for a while it's
76:14 - not easy meeting up with internet
76:16 - connection and consistencies i missed
76:18 - everyone but it's good to be back home
76:21 - uh awesome
76:23 - hey
76:24 - uh
76:24 - really glad to see you uh in the chat i
76:27 - hope everything's going well for you
76:29 - um
76:30 - okay
76:32 - so now i do have to go i have to go to a
76:34 - meeting in a few minutes but i really
76:36 - enjoyed uh this live stream um it was
76:39 - really cool definitely um a lot of new
76:41 - people in the chat that i haven't gotten
76:43 - to talk to yet so i'm really excited
76:46 - about that
76:47 - and
76:49 - uh yeah so hopefully
76:52 - you learned something and uh i
76:55 - we got some cool stuff done
76:57 - um
76:58 - so
77:00 - yeah so i guess i'll see you
77:02 - most likely on wednesday
77:05 - and uh until then have a great
77:07 - two days

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse today we're gonna handle some ui stuff in particular the first thing i'd like to go over is this uh search input here so i'd like to add a little icon so that a user could close the search uh let's see we had something like this on another project let me show you what i'm what i'm thinking about yes um so i think it'd be something like this uh you know what i think we have a bug right now but you'll be able to see it maybe no oh well basically what i'd like to happen is you click this it pops out and then there's an icon to close it and you can also click on the search icon and that will initiate a search so that's the idea all right so we don't need that project up right now let's get that out of the way um we do have a getter channel now so if you're interested in that um check out i don't know what link to give i guess let me give you this link i think that'll work i'm gonna paste this in the live chat now oh all right see now the uh the camera's frozen from uh goodness all right let's move that out of the way let me grab this one which is way too big let's see if we can shrink it i must have uh i think i was messing with this at some point and got the dimensions all messed up it's kind of odd that it just started happening it hasn't happened in a really long time wow oh well um so we'll have to make do with this camera angle i'll try to remember to look uh over here if i can um but here let me i'm gonna have to sit in a different spot okay um all right so that camera and that's that's too big let's try to shrink that a bit maybe okay all right that looks better um okay cool so anyway i pasted the link to that getter channel uh in the in the live chat if i remember i'm gonna have to put that in the description i keep forgetting to do that but in case you're watching and you can't see the link you're maybe you're watching later on or uh just listening it's getter.i am slash live coding with jesse oh i'm sorry it's live coding with jesse free code camp so all of that all right and um just want to show you before we get started a project that one of you made so harshit who is a frequent contributor so i don't know what maybe for the last month or so very frequent contributor and uh so he has made a pomodoro timer you all know that i um that i use a pomodoro timer and i use the tomato timer well he's made the same functionality if not more than the tomato timer and he's done it in react with gatsby and then published it with now which uh if you're not familiar with now it's it's from the same people that made next uh js so i think it's i think it's zeit is the company anyway really really useful probably i can't really think of an easier way aside from github pages to deploy something get up pages is somewhat limited but now it's just a super super easy way to do it and anyway so if you haven't used that before i recommend it anyway uh so you can see pomodoro timer can start it stop it take long breaks reset right so it's pretty cool pretty cool so anyway thanks for sharing that hardship and also the uh repo is available um so everybody wants to check that out um pomodoro hyphen gatsby is the name of the repo but looks pretty cool the file that has most of the the most stuff going on is the timer.js so that's that's where all the the logic is i suppose anyway really cool so maybe uh let's use harshet's timer today shrink it down a bit and put it up here in the corner and since we've started here may as well get started we're going to do two pomodoro sessions today and then questions after um yeah we'll actually we'll see i need to be done in about an hour or so so i can go to a meeting and i keep forgetting that i'm on a different uh screen now let me see trying to let me aim this camera better there we go all right that's more centered okay um okay well i am getting a call so sorry about this hold on hello yes all right sorry about that uh now's a great time to give my disclaimer about this i haven't given this in a long time but live coding with jesse is all about showing what my daytoday life is like as a frontend developer so mistakes included interruptions included so sometimes i will have somebody knock on my door at my office and i have to go talk to him or i'll get a phone call so that happens i really don't like when it's that long of a delay because that's no fun for for you all but is a good indication uh so i'm going to take a minute and just explain why i think this phone call was actually ended up being a good thing so that phone call which took i don't know 10 minutes maybe was all about the login system for the bulletin so one of the reasons why we're redoing the bulletin so we're redoing this and we have a new hopefully better login system and eventually we we may even tie it in with the single signon system for the university so it should be even better is because i get calls like that and trying to walk people through how to sign in in this case it was an old version of internet explorer that was the problem but then even when switching to chrome there was still some confusion and that's why it took so long so i think um my my coworker here who is trying to access the bulletin can access it now but i'm still there there was some trouble so i'm still going to set up a time tomorrow or the next day to go over and check out her computer so you could see how a lot of my time ends up being spent on that that login so i think it definitely merits a a redo of the bulletin and this has been out for a year now uh just about a year and so for the whole year i've been you know getting these these types of calls so there were a lot more when it first came out so i'd say the first six months there were a lot more calls than this last six months but still um you know certainly interrupts the whatever i'm working on and and can take up a lot of a lot of time uh so anyway i guess the the the moral of the story is if you do things right the first time it'll save you a lot of time in the long run not that i did it wrong i don't think it's just i i guess at the time i didn't realize how many people on campus were using very old versions of browsers so that was most of the calls that i get the solution is simply well don't use internet explorer 8 anymore or something like that or firefox 4 so anyway all right so let's um let's get started all right someone had said turn the mic on is you all can hear me now right i did turn the mic on um yeah i thought about leaving the mic on for that call but then i thought well maybe this person wouldn't want their conversation here but uh i actu i could have actually there is not really anything that i said that would have even given away uh any secrets you know okay cool okay so the mic my mic is on now so i just wanted to verify before i did anything important all right i tell you what next time i get a call if it's a call like that i'll turn the mic on and uh then you all can hear uh how i how i deal with um i guess troubleshooting uh issues over the phone all right so let's go in now and uh let's go into our code and figure out where this component is and let's try to get some of that functionality like i was explaining uh earlier so uh here in what is this at bar dot js and app.js.js we have we're bringing in this icon button and that's our search icon okay and then we have a handle search toggle okay and that happens when that happens let's see let's see if this handle search toggle there we go okay so here's where it comes up so if you're not familiar uh with this in react uh if you're not familiar with react at all or maybe you're just starting out with react one of the i think it's a cool thing but it's also can sometimes be a confusing thing is that you can actually pass up actions up to parent components and then have the functions that you'd like to be called on that action actually reside in an entirely different component and that's what we have going on here so we had in an app bar right we have on click handle search toggle but when we try to find handle search toggle right the only other place on the page where we have that is where we're passing in right all of this so and actually that might be is is that a style for search title or these are our profs i think actually these are our props okay so it's just a prop we need to go up to the parent component which in this case is index.js for our layout folder and we have you can see our top bar component so in our for our top bar component we're passing down right this function and let's see where we have handle handle search toggle so this is what really gets called even though it doesn't actually live in that um component um okay harsh destructuring that's the word for it uh i always forget that that's the word for it so when you break down the props like we just saw um so you don't basically you don't have to pre type in this props and then the prop name every single time it's really useful if you have a lot of props uh you can just destructure and have all the props get passed into the component you don't have to worry about using this props so uh very useful but here's basically what what happens and this is really what we want to um what we want to work on so we change the styles for our search icon and our search styles let's see so let's check out our state here's our search styles search icon styles so in this case this says so we start out with display nondisplay block okay and let's let's go back let's let's see it in action all right so we're going to inspect now i have um the react dev tools there we go okay so with our dev tools let's go to this component which was okay this was our index component so we should be able to go can we go top bar oh no we want to go up state there we go okay so here's is our state right now so hopefully you can see that over here in the corner let me make sure i'm not covering it up okay i'm not all right so just check this out so in real time we can see what our state is on that that top component all right it's not in terms of the layout folder it's the root component so we can see our search icon styles and then our search styles okay and we can watch them change actually i should uh let's see if i can get him to change by clicking there we go okay so let's inspect again and go to correct i have to go down a bit oh yeah am i too far down route stay all right let's go back to the it was home page simpler there okay there we go it's fine apollo home yeah there we go so we're in layout i probably could have found it on the other one i just wasn't patient enough to click through uh if anybody knows of an easier way to open all this stuff and get down to a component let me know is search the the only way that's really easy to do that i know i've i have used a search before but i mean i guess i could find it down here oh well um okay so now let's let's see the change happen so right now search icon styles this display block search styles display none and then when we click this right they flip okay so that's that's how we do that transition in in react right um so let's see let's go back here and let's go to first thing we need to do i guess is put in those elements that we want right no sense in putting in a new state and everything if there's nothing for it to change see gps icon so let me check this where are we at top left okay this is is this what you are talking about this icon select the rack element in the page to inspect it cool and it takes you right to it i like that cool i never knew that awesome thanks for the advice uh harshit and john that's really cool so if you want to just be able to click something and go right to it and react you can click the target and then let's go up to here this one and then click right on that element and it'll take you right to it really cool let's see okay so let's go into our at bar dot js and now we want to we want to add in we need to add in a close icon and we're going to need to change some of the styles for the search icon okay so let me see switch please okay my timer ran out uh thanks for reminding me to check the timer so um so any so harsh it on on your timer i guess you don't have a sound i wasn't prompted to allow allow sounds or anything or allow notifications yeah so i didn't hear any audio it's possible that i just i missed it i wasn't paying attention um but uh okay so let's take a short break right now um in between coding sessions we take a five minute break and i go in the live chat and answer questions and then at the end i answer anything that i wasn't able to get to in our little five minute session so let me scroll through and let's see oh rob was able to make it uh awesome so i'm really glad that you could make it um rob had commented earlier on one of the videos about not not being able to make it for the live uh stream so really awesome that you you did get to make it uh let's see oh okay so on harsh it's i'm assuming with the pomodoro clock you're talking about uh has a bug with github pages that it it redirects um to the main page uh redirects request the main profile which causes conflicts okay yeah there are actually i there is a it's a little weird when you're trying to use some some types of things with like some types of sites with github pages i've had some issues before i i believe i've found some workarounds for that but um yeah it's not 100 straightforward let's see her should ask if anyone has ever has tried firefox developer edition says it's really very cool i actually haven't i haven't tried that so maybe i'll have to try that out okay so uh anthony asks what are the topics on this live stream and uh some of the responses where material ui and react node.js um express yeah yeah definitely i mean that pretty much covers it um but i guess we use create react app to you know scaffold the thing but um other than that i think that does cover everything eventually when we make this live uh it's gonna sit behind um engine x acting as a reverse proxy so we may do a little bit of configuration with nginx but just very minimal let's see uh josh modian says do you use visual studio code i do use visual studio code sometimes did i never actually start this no i didn't uh oh i did something okay now it's working i mean obviously i've already taken up several minutes but um okay cool harsh is saying we just swapped the displays yeah i just i kind of wanted to show um show it like in the react dev tools just number one just in case somebody's never used them uh but then also just to get the idea for people coming from like a um like a jquery mentality more to react that like we're not we're not directly manipulating the stuff on the page like we're changing state and then based on that state react does its thing so um i know when i was first starting with react that was a shift like i i had to get used to that so anyway so i mean hopefully it was it was helpful uh josh rhodey and what program do you use oh um right now i'm using adam as my editor uh joshua says what do you mainly use i mainly use adam so right right now adam's my primary editor and then sometimes visual studio code uh so i i keep thinking about switching to being having visual studio code be my primary one i just haven't made that switch yet um so it's possibility it might happen let's see okay so i've gotten through everything in the live chat right now and i've probably gone over my five minutes at this point i'm not sure because this this isn't the the right time so uh i'm gonna go back now okay so it's about nine minutes after 2 p.m my time uh so yeah so let's do one i guess we'll try to get in one more pomodoro session um okay uh let's go back here and okay so we need to bring in a search icon or i'm sorry a close icon uh where are we bringing in our icons okay let's just import another one here and i'm just gonna guess and say close and we'll see if it works if anybody else happens to know what the real name is let me know otherwise we might be able to save a few minutes by just putting that in and uh let's see oh we have one more question so matt matt correct me if i'm pronouncing this wrong is it matija or matija i don't know uh let me know i really want to get it right so jesse will wrap you here in the future what do you personally think um if if by future you mean the next like three years one to three years then yes definitely if we're talking more like five years probably uh but five to ten years who knows right i mean it's that's just in computer time it's just way um way too long so harsh is saying reload the timer page i did i reloaded it and started again oh you know what maybe it's the delay in the video so you might be seeing you might not have seen it yet so uh sorry about that let's see i lost my train of thought oh okay we have that icon so let's throw this icon in and now we're just gonna see if this this even does anything if it even works so yep it did great so it was named close awesome okay so we now have that close icon and the search icon we don't want the close icon to be visible by default though so what we need to do let's see how we're doing this style switch icon styles and then we have okay it was matia awesome i'm glad i got it right uh all right and that goes for anybody if ever if i ever pronounce any of your names wrong please uh call me out on it let me know all right so sorry for kind of looking around on this harshit actually made this part i believe yeah you did the search right harshi um so harsha did this so i've seen this only once whenever i reviewed the pull request and that was a little while ago should apply input styles see an input okay um yeah where's our input here it is search styles okay so let's go can i throw this style right let's try to throw it right on the icon oh okay so matthias uh it's croatian okay cool i don't think i've had any experience with uh with croatian before so uh that's really it's really cool um style okay so i i know i've said this before but in case you you haven't been around or you know to hear this there are many ways to handle styles in react so this is one of the ways that we're doing it we're passing around styles like they're variables uh we're bringing them into our components so we certainly could style with regular css like we're doing here all right but we're choosing to do it another way and um i don't know that it's settled that there is a number one best way to do styles yet and react it's still kind of wide open so um which is fun it's it's fun we get to try a lot of different things there's a lot of different opinions on on how to do it search icon style nope that's not what i wanted i wanted search styles there we go all right let's save that we'll go back here and check it out we should see yep we see that let's open it okay and we now have i believe conflicting styles so let's let's actually remove this it makes sense to remove this and you know what let's just let's copy all of this all right and put it here and what we want is to change this to search styles and i'm going to leave this on click for now but we we may end up changing that and then we're going to add our close icon here and let me get rid of some of this space because it just annoys me and um there we go oops that's all right okay all right so let's check out uh what it looks like now we should be able to see the close icon yes we can all right the placement of that icon is actually not bad i had envisioned it as being on the line here so i guess within the input but that works and we can certainly take care of that as well with a little bit of positioning um yeah but for now just trying to get the functionality what we want to happen when we click that oh is it already in there yes i wondered if that would happen i i was hopeful i didn't want to say it because i didn't want to sound even more like i don't know what i'm talking about uh but i was hopeful that the way harshit made the handle search toggle that it would just do the opposite right of the styles which is exactly what he did so that was awesome and look at that so this is the functionality that we want the only other thing that i'm thinking about and i'm not sure about but let me run it by you all and let me know what you think um previously on some of my projects i've included a search icon sometimes on this side sometimes on this side i can't remember which which side i usually do but i include a search icon uh my thinking being uh someone may want to click especially on mobile maybe they would prefer to to try to click some sort of icon do you think that's a reasonable um do you think it's a reasonable thing to think or am i just trying to build in things that are unnecessary here um i uh i want to hear what you all think because i wouldn't want to add anything into the ui and add functionality that is not going to improve what we have right then it just complicates things so i i'm kind of really lean towards minimalistic you know is that everything there should have a purpose it for being there and it should be useful to the user so um anyway uh so i'll um i'll just keep checking the live chat to see if anyone has any um any input let's see okay so dessal rollo de serolo uh says i think it's not necessary okay actually let me change before i forget i just forgot to change the title for this uh oops um this is gonna be close search close search yeah let's do let's say close search um i would i would much rather be more specific here i don't i don't want anyone thinking that if they click it it would close everything out uh because you know we we do have a lot of people that uh that view the bulletin that are very unfamiliar with computers so i'd like to be as specific as i can actually now what i think about it i want to change the font size for those tool tips because the people who really need those tooltips probably also need larger font sizes so we'll have to look up in uh material ui if they've already thought of some way like to pass a prop or something if not we can just change it with css but i really i think it could be be a little larger okay let's see definitely oh okay so blake's in favor of the search icon oh okay rook rook mentions uh auto focus on the search bar that's a great idea let's see okay john hanson says mobile logic for ui can be tricky only way to really know if a button or icon to click for a function is by using something like google tag manager actually yeah i mean we could we could put click handlers uh um click tracking on there just to see we put uh on that resource center project that we we did before this i put uh click tracking i think i did it it could have been somebody a pull request if so uh sorry i've i i'm not giving you credit here um but i think i put click tracking through google analytics on everything and it was pretty simple um actually i was just checking the analytics earlier today and we got a lot of good data on clicks and things uh our says will you set up analytics for this yeah we'll definitely set up analytics for this so my the head of my department has to go to sometimes to the president of the the college the president university or just in general like the board and report on how these websites are doing so she really likes to have data like this like how many people clicked to download this and how many people went here right so so i always try to give as much data as i can sometimes i never use the data but it's good if i have it if she comes into my office and says hey i got a meeting in 10 minutes can i have this data then i have it and it makes me look good and it makes her look good so we're definitely going to do analytics right so auto focus search icon autofocus tricky sometimes before you scroll ahead somewhere you don't want add placeholder okay all right so we have a a lot of good ideas let me try to get them all here and just explain it so uh a placeholder when you open this up that definitely makes sense i have a placeholder here i like that we have some conflicting opinions on whether or not we should put a search icon in there so let's save that for last we may not even have time to do it no matter what uh for today's stream but let's save that for last since we're still somewhat undecided on it and then also we're talking about auto focus which there's some discussion about auto focus as well because it can mess up the scroll sometimes i really do like the idea of auto focus because you know you have to click you click search and then you have to click here i i tell you what i'm going to go with auto focus but i'm going to keep in mind when we're testing and try to make sure that it's not messing up the scroll but i i know i would really appreciate in auto focus because if i'm clicking that search icon i want to search so auto focus would be great so let's do that let's so we'll do two things for sure assuming we have time we'll set up auto focus on click and then we will put in some placeholder text there okay let's see and i actually want to i may just check this out on my other screen quickly i just want to look at what the search thing looks like currently on the current bulletin and it looks like okay we actually do let me let me just show you this now i guess so in the current bulletin when you click the search icon so we actually we change the entire uh nav to the search but we do actually have a search icon and a close i wonder you know what i think my search icon isn't even clickable i don't think it's clickable so i think if we just put a placeholder that says search that'll be fine i don't think we need the icon now we do obviously include the close but the search happens when the user stops typing or sometimes even as they're typing depending on how fast they're typing so i just want it to be familiar to the users who are used to that search so the look of it is going to be slightly different because we're not going with this huge search bar that changes the whole nav but i'd like the functionality to be you know identical if possible if not at least as close as possible just to make the transition you know a little bit more smooth all right so let's add where's our text field let's see if we can just say placeholder i don't know i don't know what it is for material ui um which is the the ui framework that we're using but let's try placeholder because that makes sense if it works then we don't have to look it up and save some time yay that works okay so we have the placeholder it goes away when you type perfect and it comes back we don't type excellent all right that was a great idea i think it was hardship that had the idea for the placeholder so awesome um let's see so that was easy it didn't take very much time what was the other autofocus so autofocus may take a bit more time i don't know that i've ever done auto focus and react no i take that back i did i have done it before but it's been i think i did it in march so it's been quite a while so i will have to look that up so let me i'll look this up and all right let's see let me see if anyone has anything to say about the autofocus okay if anyone has implemented autofocus recently in react uh any help would be appreciated otherwise i'm going to try to look it up um let's see also he said uh so we have now let me know if i'm pronouncing your name wrong because it's written in characters i'm not familiar with so i'm arabic i think but is it uh ibrahim so let me know if that's wrong but i think it's ibrahim um but like i said the characters are in arabic so i i could definitely be mistaken but anyway abraham says i love your channel it's very active uh and then have a heart on there so awesome i'm really glad you you love the channel and uh thanks for watching and joining in in the live chat okay so harshit says we could just make a ref and call focus on click oh okay rook that's a that's a good idea so harshit's suggestion will definitely work rook has another idea that could save us a lot of time uh auto focus as a prop so let's try to put autofocus as a prop on the search bar rook saying because it only appears when you click the search icon it should be fine right um yeah yeah you're right it should be fine because it it won't exist in the dom at all until you click so there's no real danger of it accidentally being auto focused and not visible all right let's try that all right it could work it's it's such an easy fix it's worth a try even if it doesn't work okay so it didn't work um but still that was good thinking though uh eunice says how did you learn arabic i didn't google translate learned arabic so i just think it's polite to try to figure out someone's name even if i don't know the characters so um i know for me it would i would feel good if somebody took the time to do that so anyway so i think it's worth it so on my other screen i google translated it so unfortunately i i don't know arabic um oh harsh it you're right you're right um my mistake i missed i mistakenly said that this wouldn't exist but it in fact it does because um the way harsh it made it it's it's only using display none it's not actually um removing a component so my mistake i usually do stuff like that uh where i i make the components actually completely be gone you know be rendered or not rendered based on on the prop so anyway so yeah so that might be an issue but let's try i guess i guess it's worth the shot just to check material ui and see if they have some builtin way of handling something like this it could save us some time um let's try it out text field let's see that's what we're using right text field yes okay auto focus oh okay um cool so autofocus does work we just needed to camel case it so let's see let's try this again auto focus you know what that's not going to work because it auto focuses when the component mounts but then i'm clicking away so that should that will undo the focus so actually let's let's see i wonder if this will work no it didn't i was wondering if when i typed it would actually go in here um even before so let's let's switch this up a bit um no i'm not gonna have time for this shoot okay so in case i don't do this on the stream and i do it before tomorrow stream um actually i'm not going to stream tomorrow i'll give you more info about that in a second i'm not going to have enough time before my meeting to implement this but here's my plan right now when you do handle search toggle when when you click uh a button that fires off handle search toggle it's just changing uh the css from display block to display none you know back and forth what i want to have happen instead is that this text field actually renders on you know on uh on click so what we'll end up having and we'll have to pass down let's see we'll have to change up a little bit about what's going on with our state and then make sure we pass it down like we're doing with these search styles and then we're going to have to adjust our handle search toggle function that resides in our index.js within our layout folder but the end result is going to be that we're going to end up having some sort of uh ternary that is going to check the state which the state and might end up being like show show search um input or something which would just be a boolean and so we'll end up having something like show search um and then if we are showing search we'll put all of that in here right we'll show this otherwise we'll show this so actually i won't do it like this i'll end up doing it like uh question mark okay i am hearing the beeping sound now so my pomodoro session is up and then we'll put this in i actually might have time to do this uh so this is what'll end up happening and so right now it's going to break because i don't actually have so show search being passed down as a prop but what we'll end up doing is in index we'll add show search by default it's going to be false okay so and then where we have our top bar we're going to pass on so show search equals this dot state dot show search and then now what's this video uh tool to title a closed search uh we gotta wrap it um yes we can't have this so let's just wrap this in a div oops and this should be good yeah sure it's just not defined and i didn't bring it in here so let's let's destructure a little bit here show search all right now it should work okay so we had something happen which i'm going to take as a win right now since i just tried to do that as fast as i possibly could um yeah which should happen so this is search yeah i don't know what went wrong but i don't have time to check it out right now but you can see basically the the concept that i'm trying to go for um and the reason being i think we could get this auto focus to work if um if we can have this actually this component render when you click the search icon because i believe this auto focus fires when the component mounts so we want to delay the mounting until the user actually clicks on that icon so anyway that's the idea obviously something's weird about it right now since it's not showing at all but we'll get that fixed it could be something as simple as wrapping it in a div somehow change the styles not sure okay uh let me try quickly to go through the live chat and answer all your questions and let's see i'm trying to find where i left off okay so hardship has pasted a link to a gist that's has a debate about css uh and react and and how to use it so anyway it looks really really helpful let's check and bring it over here so i'll i'll paste the link in the chat as well so it's clickable for you all it's way too long of a link for me to actually read out to anybody that that can't see the live chat so sorry for that um if someone wants to put in a comment to the video that would be awesome um i'll make sure it gets approved a lot of times uh if you try to paste a link in a comment to a video it gets flagged as spam but i'll go in and approve it okay so look at all the different ways to do this so really cool thanks for sharing that harshit uh abstract cats says this seems like a cool learn session as well for those of us just learning i started learning web design about 10 years ago and got distracted but now going full steam ahead awesome awesome that's that that kind of sounds like like me as well um i learned uh some some web development in um in high school and then didn't really do that much with it until too much later on so i'm trying to think actually 10 years might be it might be about the same 10 years so uh yeah well hopefully you learn stuff i do my best to try to explain things that i think might be confusing to people who are just starting out or not familiar with react so you know i don't always i'm sure i i just skip over some things and don't realize that it's i should probably explain but when i when i remember i really uh try to explain as well as i can please all right let's see i'm scrolling through the chat here there's not a whole lot of questions there's a lot of um a lot of stuff i already kind of went over when we were um kind of going back and forth trying to find solutions to this auto focus thing josh modian says for the closed search you could try to make it so that when the user clicks off it closes um yeah yeah definitely i think that's um i actually have thought about that i'm gonna think when i was thinking about it earlier and uh i there was some reason why i thought maybe i shouldn't do it and i can't remember now i can't believe i can't remember i've just tried to think about it but that's that's actually not a bad idea um let's see oh harsha said it it should have played the audio it did it did play the audio this time so that that pomodoro timer i i heard it um oh okay john b says try auto focus true i could try that yeah i mean i i assumed that i could just put it in there and it would automatically be true um usually you can do that uh okay yeah so maybe uh um i'll try that out probably sometime tomorrow um let's see immediately i click a post all right harsha says commit this pr immediately so have you did you submit a pull request now no let's see what time it is okay um philip says i haven't started i started learning javascript but went probably too fast since i missed a lot of the vanilla javascript um but i work fulltime with react now should i fill my missing basic javascript knowledge um yeah i i think it's it's always good to have a good knowledge of of javascript um so if you if you can get your work done and it's good work then i wouldn't make it you know a huge priority to fill that in but it might not be a bad idea to just go through some of the basics a little bit every day even if it's only a few minutes i think that you know that would be good because you never know react is is certainly relevant now and i think it will be for at least a few more years but you never know what will happen in the future and the more javascript plain vanilla javascript you know uh the better you'll be able to adapt to any javascript based system that that comes up uh so yeah so probably don't need to learn it right now you know not this month or not even this year but if you do a little bit at a time you i think you'll set yourself up to be able to to adapt uh to changes and make sure that you know you could still do good work uh no matter what happens oh okay how should i get it harsh is saying i should commit this okay cool um yeah let me commit this then and um then i'm gonna have to wrap things up because i have to go to my meeting but um okay that looks good tomorrow i'm not gonna stream so i was looking at my calendar earlier and uh i just have so many meetings tomorrow uh that in and they're spaced out so that i have like an hour between meetings so there's not really a great time for me to uh to do a stream i mean the only possibility would be if somehow i got into work really early and then did a morning stream i don't think that's gonna happen um so on the off chance that i do get in really early maybe i'll do that otherwise most likely not gonna stream but wednesday is looking good for a stream i currently have no meetings scheduled so i think wednesday's like nearly for sure there's going to be a stream unless something weird happens but tomorrow probably no stream uh and if there is one it will probably be in early morning eastern time so
