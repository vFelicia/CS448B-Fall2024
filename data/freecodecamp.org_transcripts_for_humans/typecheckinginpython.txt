00:00 - the best way for type checking in Python
00:02 - is by using is instance this is the
00:05 - traditional way of checking the type of
00:07 - a particular variable in python as you
00:09 - can see we have to use the type function
00:11 - and check if it's equals to a particular
00:14 - data type then we can print whatever we
00:16 - want to print but a better and more
00:17 - reliable way of doing this is by using
00:20 - this instance all you need to do is say
00:22 - if is instance then you need to pass in
00:25 - the value and the data type that you
00:27 - want to check and do whatever you want
00:30 - to do if this condition is true so if I
00:32 - run this you can see that both of them
00:34 - says value is an integer but this is a
00:38 - better and more reliable way of doing
00:40 - this
