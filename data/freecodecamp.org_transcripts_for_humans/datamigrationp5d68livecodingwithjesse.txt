00:01 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:03 - jesse i'm jesse and today
00:06 - we're going to migrate some more data so
00:08 - a little while ago we had a similar
00:10 - stream
00:11 - uh so the plan is
00:15 - i have
00:16 - a spreadsheet
00:18 - and each row in the spreadsheet
00:19 - represents
00:21 - a piece of data that we'd like to
00:23 - migrate from
00:25 - a sql server database to a mysql
00:27 - database and to get from one database to
00:30 - the other
00:31 - we're using
00:32 - two tools to help us out a little node
00:35 - script
00:37 - so node.js is
00:40 - it's a way to run javascript server side
00:43 - and then we're also using the wordpress
00:46 - rest api
00:48 - to get the data the rest of the way so
00:50 - node pulls the data out of the sql
00:53 - server database and then
00:56 - the wordpress api puts the data into
01:00 - the
01:02 - my sql database i might mess that up so
01:04 - sql server to my sequel but
01:07 - um that's the plan
01:10 - i'm i'm gonna win you ahead of time it's
01:12 - not the most exciting thing in the world
01:15 - but uh i think it's a
01:19 - an okay example of
01:22 - some things that may have to happen when
01:24 - you're migrating from an old system to a
01:26 - new system and
01:28 - you can't just write one script and have
01:30 - everything come over it just doesn't
01:32 - work like that all the time
01:36 - so we're gonna have to kind of pick
01:37 - through the data try to bring it over
01:40 - and in as big a chunks as we possibly
01:42 - can but we still need to bring it over
01:45 - in a way that
01:46 - we're going to be able to make sense of
01:47 - it all and and use it
01:50 - so
01:51 - we're going to switch back and forth
01:52 - between the
01:55 - the data table we're gonna modify our
01:58 - our node script
02:00 - uh and run it
02:01 - and then we're also gonna check on this
02:04 - is a website
02:05 - uh that we're ultimately building here
02:07 - so we're going to check on the old
02:09 - version of the website
02:10 - to try to figure out like
02:12 - is this data even live do we need it
02:15 - um and if it's still there in the
02:18 - website like what's the context of this
02:20 - data to give us a better idea of
02:23 - where we should put it in the new
02:24 - database
02:27 - [Music]
02:28 - so that's the plan
02:36 - my wife is messaging me uh on my other
02:39 - screen
02:40 - and um
02:42 - she's doing some coding she's doing the
02:44 - udacity front-end nanodegree
02:47 - so she's messed she's sending me
02:49 - screenshots of her code and messaging me
02:57 - she must not know i'm streaming
03:04 - all right so let me switch over
03:07 - to my screen here you can see this is
03:09 - what i was working on
03:13 - right before i started
03:15 - let me adjust this a little bit
03:18 - okay
03:20 - um
03:22 - i'm gonna check the live chat and then
03:23 - we'll get started
03:25 - hey everyone
03:27 - um
03:35 - all right cool looks like
03:36 - you're talking about a race that
03:38 - happened uh this weekend
03:40 - um oh matthew asked if she started the
03:42 - memory project yet she's on the memory
03:44 - project right now that's the one she's
03:46 - working on
03:47 - so um
03:48 - she's working on some some click
03:50 - handlers for the cards
03:52 - and that was it actually works for her
03:55 - in codepen but not locally on her
03:58 - machine so
04:01 - anyway
04:02 - uh
04:03 - i think
04:04 - she'll probably be able to figure it out
04:06 - and
04:08 - uh
04:10 - she's been doing a pretty good job of
04:11 - getting getting through it
04:14 - okay so
04:17 - i brought over
04:19 - here let me start my pomodoro session
04:22 - i'm gonna do 25 minutes of coding in
04:25 - this case data migration and then five
04:28 - minutes a question and answer and we're
04:30 - going to go back and forth i do have a
04:33 - meeting in
04:34 - less than an hour and a half now
04:36 - so
04:38 - if we get a ton of questions i may not
04:40 - be able to answer them all
04:43 - but
04:44 - we're well within our normal time range
04:47 - here of around an hour for a stream
04:51 - uh someone asked for the website for
04:53 - this pomodoro timer so i'm going to copy
04:55 - and paste it into the chat here if you
04:57 - click it and it doesn't work then please
04:59 - try copying and pasting it
05:04 - all right
05:05 - so
05:06 - i i found some data here's the data that
05:09 - i found here i did this is really small
05:11 - i kind of need to keep it small to be
05:13 - able to see the range but i'm
05:16 - i'm just going to explain a little bit
05:18 - about what's going on here i found some
05:20 - data here that has to do with um
05:24 - residence life so like the dorm rooms on
05:27 - campus where students live and things
05:28 - like that so
05:30 - i assume you know this may be able to be
05:32 - like its own section its own post type
05:35 - in the in the wordpress and in the
05:37 - database or maybe we can just tag it in
05:40 - with with something else but i need to
05:42 - know
05:43 - what category this goes in so that's why
05:46 - i i just searched for it here
05:48 - and i could see hey this is residence
05:50 - life so let's click it
05:53 - and see all right what section does this
05:56 - fall under so it actually looks like
05:59 - uh
06:00 - this is kind of its own section it it's
06:03 - uh like a top level here
06:05 - so it's dot edu slash residence life so
06:10 - um it we may be able to put this in its
06:12 - own section
06:14 - uh just want to
06:17 - see if we have it if it's even a kind of
06:20 - a top level link here
06:24 - because i'm not sure where it's linked
06:25 - from
06:27 - um
06:33 - i'm guessing it would be student life
06:34 - where it's linked from so
06:36 - i'm clicking in here if you know i might
06:39 - be able to put it under the student life
06:42 - like in the section with all that data
06:44 - that we brought over
06:51 - residence life does that guy take us to
06:53 - the same spot
06:54 - oh it does it does
06:57 - interesting
06:59 - maybe we'll do that then
07:01 - this would be a little bit easier uh
07:03 - than making a completely new
07:05 - new post type uh so
07:07 - what we'll do is
07:09 - we already have a section for stuff like
07:12 - this under student life
07:14 - and let me let me pull up the wordpress
07:20 - did i make this
07:22 - yeah i think this is it
07:25 - all right so we have a wordpress
07:26 - installation we've been putting all this
07:28 - data into
07:30 - and we can see i will make this a bit
07:32 - bigger for you all to see
07:34 - so we have all these different data
07:36 - types
07:37 - to keep things straight for us here
07:40 - and
07:41 - we need to find the one that's student
07:43 - life
07:43 - now the users who are going to be in
07:45 - charge of editing this very few users
07:47 - are going to see all of this it's it's a
07:48 - bit much right
07:50 - so most people only see maybe one or two
07:52 - types so it'll be much cleaner easier to
07:55 - edit
07:57 - i thought i had student life stuff
07:59 - student profile pages
08:01 - where we had
08:03 - student life pages there we are
08:06 - okay so we already have a bunch of
08:07 - student life pages
08:10 - and wow we we have quite a few we have
08:13 - three pages of student life pages
08:18 - looks like these are a lot of the
08:20 - student organizations
08:22 - okay wonderful i think this will fit
08:24 - well in there
08:28 - so here's what we need to do we need a
08:29 - few pieces of of information in order to
08:32 - make this script work so we need to know
08:35 - what the folder id is that this data
08:37 - lives in
08:38 - and we also need to know what the post
08:41 - type the slug is right for so it's like
08:44 - a unique identifier for that post type
08:47 - in this case it's going to be i student
08:50 - life
08:51 - page i believe it will be
08:54 - student life
08:56 - pages
08:58 - i think that's it we'll find out if i
09:00 - run it and it doesn't work then i'll
09:02 - know that's the wrong one
09:04 - and uh we need this
09:06 - id is 486.
09:09 - so let's plug in 486
09:14 - we're going to save that uh quickly i'll
09:17 - just go over this uh basically we're
09:19 - using uh the sqlize
09:23 - to
09:24 - all right this doesn't
09:26 - we're all importing the stuff right so
09:27 - this doesn't come
09:30 - with
09:30 - um node.js by default right
09:33 - uh so we're using sqlize to help us
09:36 - interact with a sql database a little
09:38 - bit easier right and then we have our
09:42 - our sql query
09:44 - if it's a little bit different than
09:45 - you're used to uh sql has kind of
09:48 - different flavors depending on the type
09:49 - of sql database so a query for my sql
09:53 - may look slightly different than sql
09:54 - server
09:55 - but
09:56 - you can kind of figure out what's going
09:58 - on if you are familiar with sql
09:59 - basically we're just getting
10:01 - a little bit of
10:03 - we're specifying um
10:05 - what data we want
10:07 - from from where we want it so from what
10:10 - section of the database we wanted
10:13 - and this data length greater than zero
10:16 - just means i don't even want to bother
10:17 - pulling in any data that is is empty
10:20 - right it doesn't have any content at all
10:23 - right and in our case our contents html
10:25 - markup if it doesn't have markup i don't
10:27 - really want it
10:30 - and that's pretty much it then down here
10:32 - we're basically taking that data we're
10:34 - getting and we are
10:37 - creating
10:38 - posts in wordpress and then having them
10:41 - put into my sql database
10:43 - um and
10:45 - we're
10:47 - taking the the data that has a certain
10:49 - name in the mysql database and we're
10:51 - giving it a name that is more
10:53 - appropriate
10:55 - or i'm sorry in our sql server database
10:57 - we're giving it a name that's more
10:58 - appropriate for wordpress and my sequel
11:02 - and in fact i do want to get rid of this
11:07 - that was uh for a previous thing we were
11:08 - working on
11:10 - all right great that that looks uh oops
11:14 - accidentally hit a key that looks
11:16 - perfect
11:17 - let's now run this so we need to run
11:20 - um
11:24 - migrate.js
11:28 - all right it's doing something
11:30 - and let's stop that
11:32 - and we're going to check to to make sure
11:35 - that these got inserted so right now we
11:36 - have 50 items if i refresh and it's more
11:38 - than 50 then it works
11:43 - nope it didn't work
11:47 - all right so why did it not work
11:49 - probably because i put in
11:51 - the wrong
11:52 - post type
11:54 - so
11:56 - student life pages
11:59 - what did i put in wrong
12:06 - all right let's check what the post type
12:09 - is
12:12 - you know actually it may tell it may
12:14 - tell me here in the slug student life
12:16 - pages
12:17 - hmm that looks right
12:23 - so what did i do
12:25 - s-t-u-d-n-t
12:28 - live
12:29 - pages
12:32 - oh you know what i don't think it's
12:34 - plural anything it needs to be singular
12:35 - student life page
12:37 - right because each one of these is a
12:39 - post so i'm creating a new student life
12:41 - page
12:42 - that's that's the problem
12:49 - all right now let's check
12:55 - there we go now we have 67 items so we
12:57 - went from 50 to 67 that's our extra 17
13:00 - items that we just added
13:02 - okay and
13:03 - so here we go these uh this
13:07 - it's it's supposed to be short for
13:08 - assisi heights so definitely gonna
13:10 - change that title before it shows up in
13:12 - uh anyone's search
13:14 - but
13:15 - uh that's uh that's basically
13:18 - the process that we go through now
13:20 - i can go in here i have all these
13:23 - selected and i'm going to remove it from
13:25 - the table
13:26 - don't worry though i have a copy of this
13:30 - this
13:31 - spreadsheet
13:33 - in case i accidentally remove stuff that
13:34 - i shouldn't but for this one trying to
13:37 - get rid of everything as soon as we pull
13:38 - it over and that way just visually it'll
13:40 - be very easy for me to see the progress
13:43 - uh and the rows go down and down and
13:45 - down
13:47 - okay i do i see a few questions in the
13:49 - chat so
13:50 - um if if any of you are new uh please be
13:53 - patient i'll i have a timer on right now
13:56 - when the timer goes off then i will go
13:58 - back to the chat and answer your
14:00 - questions
14:01 - okay here we we have some more things
14:04 - here i'm going to try to find something
14:05 - that doesn't require me to create a
14:07 - custom post type
14:09 - ah let's see
14:12 - these look like people
14:15 - lots of people
14:16 - and
14:17 - they don't work here
14:19 - are they alumni
14:23 - are they speakers yeah i don't think
14:27 - i think these may have been speakers
14:30 - distinguished speakers series okay
14:36 - i'm not sure where i want to put that
14:39 - right now
14:40 - and i know you probably can't see how
14:42 - small this is so i'm trying to read it
14:43 - out a bit
14:46 - um
14:49 - i can delete this
14:55 - some of these are just tiny
14:57 - they're just such tiny fragments of
15:01 - pieces of data we just don't need them
15:05 - let's see
15:16 - okay these look like residence halls
15:20 - residence life staff
15:22 - [Music]
15:24 - okay um is this what contact information
15:28 - or just general information so i think
15:31 - this can go in the same spot that we
15:34 - wanted in let's just verify
15:36 - uh and see here do we have information
15:40 - about residence halls here
15:44 - residence life residence halls
15:48 - yep
15:49 - so that's where these are each one of
15:51 - these residence halls
15:52 - will have its own page and some info and
15:54 - i believe that's where this is coming
15:56 - from
16:00 - okay
16:01 - great
16:04 - uh yeah so let's take this
16:06 - and
16:08 - grab this data and
16:10 - since we're going to send it to the same
16:12 - place
16:13 - all we need to do
16:15 - is
16:18 - change that folder id so this will be
16:20 - 537 so let's go up in here
16:27 - five three seven
16:30 - we'll save it
16:34 - nothing else needs to change and we'll
16:35 - run this again
16:39 - oh 20 of them
16:41 - the more i can get in per query the
16:43 - better
16:45 - once i did a query and we got like i
16:47 - don't know around 500 at once and that
16:49 - was that was awesome
16:51 - i think that was the biggest one that
16:52 - i've done so far
16:54 - all right great so we have those uh we
16:56 - should
16:57 - i know this will work but it's always
16:59 - good to verify
17:00 - uh
17:02 - not great to just you know get ahead of
17:03 - it yep now we're up to 87 items
17:06 - wonderful
17:08 - and so now we can remove these
17:12 - let's see
17:14 - yeah we can remove these from here
17:19 - i um i was not employed here at this
17:23 - university whenever uh the old site was
17:25 - built so i'm learning so much about the
17:28 - website now as i go through and get all
17:31 - this content
17:32 - there were like whole sections that i
17:34 - didn't even know existed
17:36 - uh let's see it looks like these are
17:38 - some more
17:39 - uh this these are more information are
17:42 - these
17:44 - guys
17:51 - all right these are just image galleries
17:55 - i'm gonna bring these over
17:57 - i'm not exactly sure we'll keep them i
17:59 - know some of the older images aren't
18:01 - great quality so we may want to replace
18:03 - them but
18:04 - uh better just to bring it over
18:09 - uh and this is three
18:13 - 539 is the section
18:16 - 539
18:18 - so let's let's change that
18:20 - over here
18:22 - um
18:23 - 537.
18:25 - i brought 537
18:29 - 530 it looks like 536 could come over
18:32 - too
18:38 - i think i'll bring over 536 as well
18:42 - so let's do 539
18:45 - save that
18:47 - run it
18:51 - and i'll do 536
18:54 - as well
18:55 - save that
18:57 - run it
18:59 - wonderful
19:01 - we'll verify
19:04 - 97 items great
19:06 - now
19:08 - we can just delete all of this
19:12 - wonderful okay so this is the pattern
19:14 - this is what i i do
19:16 - when i'm on campus
19:18 - uh so usually i'm on campus two days a
19:20 - week in my office my pattern of working
19:23 - for the last few weeks has been try to
19:25 - squeeze in all my meetings into those
19:27 - two days a week so that takes up a lot
19:30 - of my time uh and then when i'm not
19:32 - doing that or taking care of like other
19:35 - tasks like paperwork and things that i
19:37 - usually only do in the office
19:40 - i'm doing this over and over again
19:43 - so
19:44 - i'm almost through
19:46 - i'm getting pretty happy about that
19:50 - so it probably doesn't really make for a
19:52 - great live stream to do this i hope you
19:54 - know i don't know maybe you get just
19:56 - kind of an appreciation for
19:58 - a way that you could handle something
20:00 - like this
20:02 - um but i'll do let me see what time it
20:05 - is
20:07 - all right so i'll do this for a few more
20:09 - minutes uh and then i'll see what kind
20:11 - of questions we have and then we'll go
20:13 - from there and you all let me know
20:16 - if you really want to see any more of
20:17 - this or you'd rather me get kind of go
20:19 - to questions keep it a shorter stream
20:22 - uh i would love
20:24 - i'd like right now to find some more
20:26 - student life things and just try to like
20:29 - chunk it together so we don't have to
20:31 - change every uh you know both pieces of
20:34 - data but
20:36 - uh
20:37 - i'm also not going to spend a bunch of
20:39 - time scrolling through here to try to
20:41 - find
20:42 - some data
20:44 - so let's see we have
20:46 - a baccalaureate 2015 image gallery
20:49 - i don't think we need that these are old
20:52 - 2015
20:53 - and uh
20:55 - 2017
20:57 - 2015. so it looks like we have some
21:00 - things in here that we just we don't
21:02 - need to
21:04 - uh bring over
21:06 - these are all old
21:08 - so let's get rid of them this is 2016
21:12 - 2016 2014.
21:15 - actually let me
21:17 - yeah these are all
21:20 - together here for sure
21:24 - commencement general info
21:26 - yeah let's get rid of that
21:30 - commencement information
21:32 - yeah i don't need that
21:34 - because that's
21:37 - oops
21:39 - there we go
21:40 - yeah
21:41 - let's delete that
21:44 - um
21:45 - these conferences
21:52 - i'm not sure if they if they want these
21:54 - conferences like the details from past
21:57 - conferences or not
22:00 - maybe i'll just leave them for now and
22:02 - i'll ask my boss about it
22:08 - okay these
22:12 - all right so i recognize some of these
22:14 - names as people that work here
22:19 - okay
22:22 - i don't really want to try to sort out
22:24 - where all these people work and get them
22:26 - in the right spots so let's just keep on
22:27 - going
22:31 - oh conspiracy theories that sounds like
22:33 - a cool course
22:36 - that's crazy that's actually a course
22:39 - um
22:41 - let me see uh it's possible
22:44 - that these courses
22:45 - what happened
22:46 - i lost it
22:48 - um
22:50 - it's possible that those courses might
22:53 - be
22:55 - old and we can get rid of them
23:01 - oh you know what these are a bunch of
23:03 - old events
23:08 - as well
23:12 - i i don't know if the theater department
23:14 - would want to keep some old events uh
23:16 - just for students prospective students
23:18 - to see
23:19 - so maybe we'll i'll ask about those as
23:22 - well
23:24 - let's see
23:39 - all right looks like i can remove some
23:41 - of these two
23:42 - this makes me happy when i can just get
23:44 - rid of stuff because we're not going to
23:46 - bring it over
23:47 - uh let's see
23:50 - four six seven yeah all of these looks
23:52 - like they are uh listings for events
23:55 - that have happened
23:57 - at least a year ago
24:01 - get rid of it all
24:05 - i'm sure it doesn't matter to you and it
24:07 - seems boring but it feels amazing when i
24:09 - can just get rid of those because that
24:10 - means i don't even i don't have to do
24:12 - anything i don't have to create post
24:14 - types i don't have to migrate the data
24:15 - like it's just like hey it's it's done
24:19 - uh okay great
24:22 - you know maybe i might make this just a
24:24 - bit bigger because i know it's going to
24:26 - be hard for you all to see and it's most
24:28 - definitely
24:30 - um difficult for me to see
24:35 - let's see if i can just make this bigger
24:38 - in bulk
24:40 - come on
24:43 - let's get a 16.
24:45 - yay that's so much bigger and
24:50 - let me get a font that i like better
24:54 - you know what we we use roboto for
24:55 - everything we may as well use it for our
24:57 - spreadsheets right
25:02 - uh okay
25:04 - cool
25:04 - a little bit better i can still see all
25:07 - the data that i need so this is fine
25:11 - um
25:12 - so here we are
25:14 - academic organizations
25:17 - student clubs
25:21 - pilgrimage
25:25 - so this 469
25:27 - looks like this could also go
25:35 - in that student life
25:37 - so let's let's pull that in
25:40 - uh
25:41 - six nine
25:45 - so 469 we're going to save that
25:48 - run it
25:51 - and verify so we're going to from 97 it
25:54 - should say 99 yep 99 awesome
25:59 - and this isn't the end of it like after
26:01 - i would do this
26:03 - i would then have to go in
26:05 - and
26:06 - make sure like
26:08 - are the titles okay you know a lot of
26:10 - the titles contain abbreviations and
26:12 - things that nobody's gonna understand so
26:14 - i gotta clean up the titles gotta make
26:16 - sure the slugs for the post types are uh
26:19 - are something that we can actually work
26:21 - with uh and fit nicely in a url
26:25 - uh sometimes one
26:27 - there'll be multiple posts and really we
26:29 - could condense it down into one so
26:31 - there's a lot of cleanup that happens as
26:33 - well afterwards
26:35 - this is just kind of the first step
26:40 - and
26:41 - let's see all right counseling
26:44 - looks like we got a nice chunk of data
26:46 - here for counseling
26:48 - health center
26:51 - all right let's do that i do you know
26:53 - what i i want to see
26:56 - counseling service i want to see what
26:58 - part of the website this is on so let's
27:00 - check the website again
27:02 - um i gotta go to the search
27:11 - i can never remember how to spell
27:12 - accounts c-o-u and s-e-l
27:20 - counseling service
27:22 - i just i don't want to get the wrong
27:24 - info because we have a counseling
27:25 - program where we teach people about
27:26 - counseling but we also have counseling
27:28 - services
27:30 - there we go wellness center
27:34 - my mother-in-law is actually a counselor
27:36 - here at the same university as i am
27:39 - counseling service is under wellness
27:42 - center
27:43 - okay
27:45 - and i bet the wellness center
27:51 - pages are under
27:55 - student life
27:58 - let's
28:00 - see is like health services
28:08 - counseling services
28:10 - yeah it's under student life so let's
28:12 - throw it let's throw it in there with
28:13 - student life
28:15 - 481
28:17 - is what we want
28:23 - 481
28:25 - and
28:26 - let's migrate it
28:28 - down the road if we ever
28:30 - you know end up seeing like wow this
28:32 - this post type
28:34 - has way too many posts in it it's huge
28:37 - we can always break it out into into
28:39 - separate ones but
28:40 - right we don't want to optimize too much
28:43 - early right it's it can be at you know
28:46 - kind of a waste of time to do it too
28:48 - early and
28:49 - it may not even be necessary
28:52 - at all you know ever so
28:55 - we want to try to avoid that
28:57 - if we can
28:59 - so let's double check we'll verify and
29:01 - my timer is almost up so we'll do some
29:03 - question and answer here in just a few
29:06 - seconds
29:08 - all right awesome so that worked and the
29:10 - last thing we want to do before we
29:11 - forget
29:13 - is remove all of these posts that were
29:16 - um
29:17 - in that
29:18 - folder with the id of 481
29:24 - all right delete
29:26 - great
29:27 - okay
29:30 - so
29:35 - i'm gonna set a five minute timer uh but
29:37 - i'm not sure i'm gonna go back and do
29:39 - another
29:40 - pomodoro session of just data migration
29:43 - you all let me know like how valuable
29:46 - this is to you i kind of i have to do
29:49 - this it's getting down like i can't put
29:51 - this off any longer i got to get the
29:52 - rest of the data in so i really need to
29:55 - make sure i get this done
29:58 - otherwise i would probably be
30:00 - streaming me doing something else maybe
30:02 - a little bit more fun
30:04 - uh so
30:06 - if you have a question please put it in
30:07 - the live chat now i just want to mention
30:09 - everyone
30:10 - uh i'm gonna go to the revolution
30:13 - conference in virginia beach
30:15 - uh later this week so i'll stream

30:21 - most likely will not be able to stream
30:23 - the rest of the week so wednesday
30:25 - thursday friday no streams
30:27 - if for some reason like maybe i can find
30:30 - some really good internet when i'm there
30:32 - then maybe i can do a stream
30:34 - but i i don't know beforehand so i can't
30:37 - really guarantee anything

32:17 - nervous and um
32:19 - like like i don't know
32:21 - nervous slash excited
32:24 - about launching the site so
32:27 - um
32:28 - that's how it's going for me
32:30 - how are you doing
32:32 - hey ann is here hey anna how's it going
32:35 - uh chris asked if i've tried out css
32:38 - grid yet i've done really minimal work
32:41 - with css grid so i don't
32:44 - honestly at this point
32:46 - my knowledge of css grade is so little
32:48 - like i i don't even want to try to
32:50 - explain anything about it to anyone yet
32:52 - because i i would probably mess it up
32:54 - but it's something i really do want to
32:56 - learn more about
32:57 - um there's so many tutorials and things
33:00 - that i'd like to do right now i just
33:01 - like since it's getting close to launch
33:04 - time for the site i'm everything is
33:06 - focused on that
33:09 - so i've i haven't even been like doing
33:11 - my usual i usually try to learn new
33:14 - things as i'm working like even if it's
33:16 - just a half hour a day but i've even cut
33:19 - that out so
33:21 - uh hopefully afterwards uh after it
33:24 - launches uh on june 4th hopefully i'll
33:27 - have a little bit more time for learning
33:33 - uh christian says jesse it is nice to
33:35 - see the real work you do also all right
33:37 - cool yeah i mean pretty much everything
33:39 - i stream is
33:40 - i mean it is things that i'm doing but
33:43 - i try to save the things that i think
33:45 - will be most exciting or uh like
33:48 - informative
33:50 - or helpful for you all uh so
33:53 - but i guess there's value in showing
33:55 - kind of like the tedious boring stuff
33:57 - sometimes too
34:00 - all right john's here
34:06 - he says hail uh of the finer repetitive
34:08 - details the doing is not so pretty the
34:11 - end product is the gem
34:13 - yeah i hope
34:18 - uh
34:19 - swadisi says good luck for that i i
34:21 - guess you're talking about my trip so
34:24 - thanks
34:25 - austin says i live in virginia beach
34:27 - come use my internet oh awesome awesome
34:30 - uh austin like if if you want
34:33 - i mean i you don't have to let me use
34:34 - your internet but if you're going to be
34:36 - in virginia beach if you're interested
34:38 - in trying like meeting up getting a
34:39 - coffee or something at some point um
34:43 - let me know uh you can i think my link
34:46 - to my twitter is in the description
34:49 - you know you can dm me if you want or
34:50 - whatever um
34:53 - you know so that that might be kind of
34:55 - cool if we could find a coffee shop that
34:57 - has decent wi-fi we might be able to
35:00 - do a little stream or something
35:03 - i don't know sometimes coffee shops
35:05 - aren't great for a stream if there's a
35:06 - lot of people the background noise is
35:08 - insane
35:09 - but um
35:10 - anyway i
35:12 - i'm down to hang out i don't know how
35:14 - much time i'll have because it will be
35:15 - conference stuff all the time but
35:18 - uh i'll i will try to work it out
35:22 - all right we have greetings from ukraine
35:25 - and you know let me grab
35:28 - uh that's in um cyrillic but i'm gonna
35:31 - use google translate
35:35 - to figure out what that is
35:43 - ivan okay so ivan says greetings from
35:46 - ukraine greetings ivan thank you and
35:48 - thanks for watching
35:50 - uh and it says any news um
35:54 - i guess if
35:55 - i'm assuming you were here when i talked
35:57 - about the conference i'm going to so i
35:59 - won't repeat that but other than that
36:03 - i don't think any news
36:04 - not really
36:06 - i i mentioned before i've been on a diet
36:09 - and i've been trying to exercise and
36:11 - that's going well i'm continuing to lose
36:13 - weight so
36:15 - i'm happy about that i have a lot more
36:17 - energy
36:20 - yeah so that's that's pretty good
36:29 - all right how many says i'm doing fine
36:31 - thanks i have started learning es6
36:34 - uh or is it still early
36:42 - um i'm not i'm not here are you asking
36:45 - me if i started learning es6 or if you
36:48 - should start learning es6 uh i guess i
36:50 - can answer both
36:53 - so i do know quite a bit of es6 uh i
36:56 - don't i don't really use all of es6 all
36:59 - the time so i
37:01 - you forget what you don't use right but
37:03 - um
37:04 - you know there are some parts of es6
37:06 - that i use
37:07 - like every day like arrow functions oh
37:09 - how memes is both of us okay cool
37:12 - yeah like i mean even especially when
37:14 - we're doing react like we're using arrow
37:16 - functions all the time uh i believe like
37:19 - map filter
37:21 - sort those things i think are es6 uh
37:24 - template literals
37:25 - love template literal syntax use that a
37:27 - lot let cons those are es6
37:30 - uh so yeah so i mean
37:33 - there is
37:34 - a good chunk of es6 that
37:37 - you know i we use all the time
37:40 - um but there are certainly some things
37:42 - that you know we don't use trying what
37:44 - else um
37:46 - object destructuring
37:49 - so i mean there's
37:51 - their thing i think it's getting to the
37:52 - point now where people
37:54 - could potentially be using es6 and not
37:57 - even realize that it's es6 because it's
37:59 - just getting so um kind of
38:02 - blended in with what people are doing
38:04 - tutorials are using it so which is good
38:06 - right
38:07 - i mean we're already on es8 es6 been
38:09 - around for a while like i i think it
38:12 - will start to get even more and more
38:14 - like normal
38:15 - browser support a lot of it now so
38:18 - um
38:21 - anyway i i love
38:23 - uh all the parts of es6 that i use
38:25 - frequently are just
38:27 - there's just very helpful
38:30 - if you're not sure what es6 is it's also
38:32 - called es2015 there are some new
38:34 - features that were added to
38:36 - the javascript language
38:38 - um way back in
38:42 - uh like 2015 i don't know exactly when
38:44 - they were added but around there and uh
38:46 - you know with with transpilers you know
38:48 - people started using them before they
38:50 - were even official um
38:52 - so
38:54 - anyway that's what we talked about when
38:56 - we're saying yes es6 and yes 2015. so if
38:59 - you want to know what those what exactly
39:01 - was added you know try searching es6 uh
39:04 - i you should be able to find something
39:07 - probably on that first page of results
39:08 - that'll go through it
39:12 - uh let's see
39:14 - phoenix says hey jesse just wanted to
39:16 - ask what average salary can a guy in
39:19 - india expect for remote work in u.s
39:21 - let's consider a full-time front-end
39:23 - developer job
39:24 - all right well that's it's going to be a
39:26 - little bit hard for me to answer that
39:28 - because
39:30 - you know certainly
39:32 - i would think like a com companies here
39:34 - in the united states
39:36 - uh when they look at
39:38 - how to to compensate a remote worker
39:41 - what they usually do at least here in
39:43 - the united states is they say okay what
39:45 - is a fair wage for where that person
39:48 - lives
39:49 - so for instance uh in the united states
39:51 - in san francisco
39:53 - cost of living is really really high
39:56 - like
39:57 - amazingly high it's just astounding to
39:59 - me how much you know uh for instance
40:01 - like houses cost out there
40:04 - so
40:05 - let's just say i'm i'm just kind of
40:07 - making these numbers up
40:08 - let's just say the average front-end
40:10 - developer in san francisco makes 150 000
40:14 - a year
40:16 - if i were to get a job with a company
40:18 - but stay where i'm at and work remotely
40:20 - even if that company's headquartered in
40:22 - san francisco they're going to look at
40:23 - my market and they're going to say wow
40:26 - um
40:27 - that's a really economically depressed
40:29 - area
40:30 - you can make a living off you know much
40:33 - les
40:34 - excuse me much it takes much less to you
40:38 - know raise a family and get a house and
40:39 - everything where i'm at so they made say
40:42 - like okay we're going to pay you 80 000
40:44 - a year
40:45 - um
40:47 - so you got to take that into
40:48 - consideration so i don't know what they
40:51 - would do they might take into account
40:53 - your standard of living
40:55 - i would imagine you could probably end
40:57 - up getting a little bit more
40:59 - um
41:00 - you know
41:01 - a company i think that's headquartered
41:03 - in an expensive area is still most
41:06 - likely going to be a bit more willing
41:09 - to pay more because they're used to
41:10 - paying more
41:12 - for you know their employees where
41:14 - they're at
41:16 - but in terms of giving a number
41:19 - i don't really know i know um
41:22 - like in in pittsburgh the closest big
41:24 - city to me is pittsburgh
41:26 - and i know in pittsburgh for um
41:30 - like uh the front end full stack um
41:34 - engineer
41:36 - you're looking at
41:38 - like minimum
41:40 - basically like i i would never take a
41:43 - job for less than like 75 000 a year in
41:47 - pittsburgh anything below that it's kind
41:49 - of like
41:50 - i just wonder if the company is really
41:52 - willing to put forth resources to make a
41:54 - good product if that's what they're
41:55 - willing they either one like have no
41:57 - idea what developers are worth
42:00 - um or
42:01 - which is bad or two
42:04 - they they don't care enough or don't
42:06 - have enough money to really put into a
42:08 - project to make it succeed
42:10 - so either way i don't really want to be
42:11 - working there uh so i my bare minimum
42:15 - would be like 75 000 a year and um
42:19 - then i would consider something like in
42:22 - the 90s would be a good offer
42:24 - uh you know so anything over 90 000
42:27 - would what i would consider to be a
42:28 - really good offer and so the kind of the
42:31 - mid-range would be between 75 and
42:34 - 90.
42:35 - uh and that's u.s dollars per year
42:41 - and if we're talking so that's
42:43 - pittsburgh if we're talking san
42:45 - francisco
42:46 - i don't know add like
42:48 - 30 000 on to
42:50 - those figures
42:52 - because it's it's much more expensive
42:58 - new york's pretty expensive uh san
43:00 - francisco as far as i know is the most
43:01 - expensive place in the u.s
43:03 - um new york's also up there as being
43:06 - pretty expensive as well
43:17 - i'm not sure how to pronounce that
43:18 - please correct me uh if i'm pronouncing
43:20 - it wrong but anyway they say hey i'm
43:23 - learning i'm new to learning node i want
43:26 - to show data from the console to web
43:28 - page using body parser but i can't
43:32 - hmm
43:35 - all right so let me check my time
43:39 - see how i can answer this
43:42 - let's tell you truth
43:44 - i'm not sure right off the bat with the
43:46 - answer the only time i use body parser
43:48 - is uh when i'm grabbing data from um an
43:52 - html form and i want to do things with
43:55 - that data in node
43:57 - um so i've never dealt with that
43:59 - specific use case
44:02 - i'm trying to uh
44:04 - i'm trying to get some resources i could
44:06 - uh maybe point you to
44:10 - i'm not sure
44:12 - if anybody in here has worked with
44:14 - something similar a node please let us
44:16 - know in the live chat
44:17 - uh otherwise i'm gonna try to keep
44:18 - thinking of it if i could think of
44:20 - something before the stream's over i
44:21 - would definitely mention it
44:25 - but like i said i i haven't dealt with a
44:27 - specific situation so i'm not i'm not
44:29 - exactly sure
44:36 - okay how many says i'm doing a course on
44:38 - udemy that focuses a lot on es6 okay so
44:41 - that was why the the other question with
44:43 - the es6
44:44 - uh it says it's called mobile web
44:46 - specialists and focuses also on service
44:48 - workers all right cool service workers
44:50 - are amazing um
44:52 - we're working with service workers in
44:54 - this project as well but a lot of it is
44:57 - set up behind the scenes already by uh
45:00 - by next js which we're using so we don't
45:02 - have to directly deal with them but it
45:05 - it a service worker can
45:08 - sit between the client and the server
45:11 - and intercept network data and
45:15 - do things with it so
45:17 - it could essentially
45:18 - it could cache data
45:20 - and then the client
45:23 - uh client's network call goes out like
45:24 - normal but it doesn't go any further
45:26 - because the service worker will say oh
45:28 - they want this data we already have a
45:29 - cache just send it back
45:31 - and then you have like zero second load
45:33 - times because the data is right there
45:35 - because the service worker actually
45:36 - lives in the browser
45:38 - right
45:39 - so it doesn't have to go anywhere it
45:40 - doesn't even have to leave the browser
45:42 - so really cool
45:43 - um really cool things you can also do
45:45 - things like um calculations that would
45:48 - normally like crush uh your
45:51 - uh performance like in the dom you know
45:53 - scrolling and if you make everything all
45:55 - janky you could offload it to a service
45:57 - worker do all the calculations there and
46:00 - not uh mess up
46:02 - uh you know your flow
46:04 - um basically it wouldn't render block at
46:07 - all it wouldn't block the normal stuff
46:09 - that needs to happen on the page
46:11 - so that would that'd be pretty cool if
46:13 - you were going to do like i don't know
46:14 - like image processing somebody uploads
46:16 - an image you want to do some really like
46:19 - uh intense intent uh resource intensive
46:22 - things to it
46:23 - uh handle that in a service worker and
46:25 - then the user can still scroll around
46:27 - your page
46:28 - while that's doing its thing
46:35 - okay nikki says es6 is the language
46:38 - itself now meaning javascript
46:40 - it's in the official spec when learning
46:42 - javascript you also learn es6 now
46:44 - automatically unless you're learning old
46:46 - material okay that's that's pretty cool
46:48 - i didn't even think about that but yeah
46:49 - i mean when i went through the basic
46:51 - tutorials of javascript
46:53 - es6 was still
46:55 - um well early on it wasn't out yet and
46:58 - then later on it was still really kind
47:00 - of new so you didn't it just wasn't
47:01 - there
47:03 - uh but that's cool that it's a part of
47:05 - the tutorials now i mean that's i think
47:07 - as it should be right because there are
47:09 - some things that were a lot harder to do
47:11 - before es6
47:12 - uh and i
47:14 - i don't see that much value in making a
47:16 - new
47:17 - uh you know learner
47:19 - do it the harder way when
47:22 - you know not even the advanced people
47:23 - are doing it like that anymore uh so
47:26 - yeah i i think that's good that they're
47:28 - teaching it like that
47:33 - um
47:35 - ivan says
47:37 - asks if i'm using something else other
47:39 - than react in the front end
47:41 - or if i now i mean
47:43 - i've been using react for most of the
47:45 - projects uh it's it's not that i have
47:47 - anything against the other stuff it's
47:49 - just um
47:52 - i'm kind of taking the approach right
47:53 - now that i'd rather get really good at
47:55 - one thing than try to know a little bit
47:57 - about all the things
47:59 - um
48:00 - so i i have to give up on some things
48:03 - that i think are really cool
48:05 - but it's it's for the sake of trying to
48:07 - make ultimately a better product so i've
48:10 - chosen react
48:11 - and so for the time being i'm pretty
48:13 - much just building things in react and
48:16 - if i'm not using react that means it's
48:18 - simple enough that i can just build it
48:19 - with just plain javascript
48:21 - um
48:24 - yeah so that's where i'm at right now
48:26 - we do have some other videos on the free
48:28 - code camp channel using things like vue
48:30 - and angular so
48:31 - you could check the the backlog of
48:33 - videos and uh and see some other things
48:35 - as well
48:37 - so we're not
48:38 - we're not like just just react but for
48:41 - me personally i'm
48:43 - using a lot of react
48:49 - i've been asked if i'm the creator of
48:51 - free code camp no uh so quincy
48:54 - uh i y'all know i don't know if you all
48:56 - know quincy um so quincy created uh
49:00 - free code camp he is the founder and he
49:03 - is um
49:05 - the i don't know what is his title
49:07 - president
49:08 - i'm not
49:09 - let me look him up on twitter
49:14 - to see what his title is because i'm not
49:16 - sure
49:19 - quincy's so humble his twitter says
49:22 - teacher at free code cam he's in charge
49:24 - of it all so
49:26 - um anyway
49:27 - quincy larson uh is
49:30 - who you want so if you want to follow
49:32 - him on twitter it's at aussia o-s-s-i-a
49:37 - uh anyway he's very very awesome guy
49:40 - um so yeah he's the one that started i
49:44 - my involvement with free code camp is
49:46 - pretty limited to these live streams on
49:48 - youtube i've talked with some of the
49:50 - other people from free code camp and had
49:52 - some like video chats and things but
49:55 - uh there are a ton of other people that
49:57 - work on various areas of free code camp
50:01 - so
50:03 - uh there's a lot of people behind the
50:05 - scenes that nobody even knows about that
50:06 - are making this happen and uh
50:09 - working for free too i mean
50:11 - almost all the stuff that gets done on
50:13 - free code camp is is from volunteer time
50:20 - let's see
50:25 - um
50:27 - ed
50:28 - edison so edi cson says
50:32 - hi there i'm 28 am i too old to be a
50:35 - programmer what do you think
50:37 - uh no definitely not too old uh
50:40 - not so you're never too old to be a
50:42 - programmer i've seen stories of people a
50:45 - lot older switching careers
50:48 - learning how to become a programmer and
50:50 - get having successful programming
50:52 - careers so i am 32 years old
50:56 - uh i taught high school for for a little
50:59 - while in my mid-20s and um
51:02 - then i switched into programming in my
51:04 - late 20s
51:06 - so i had i learned a little bit before
51:09 - that but i really kind of got serious
51:11 - about it and switched into it late 20s
51:13 - and i'm employed now as a full-time
51:15 - front-end developer uh i i don't know
51:17 - how successful you would consider me but
51:20 - i make enough money to support my family
51:22 - and pay my bills
51:24 - uh so
51:26 - um i mean i have four kids i have a wife
51:29 - so i i'd
51:30 - say that's uh
51:32 - you know it's pretty successful right i
51:34 - mean i'm not um
51:37 - not making millions or anything but
51:40 - i certainly can support myself and my
51:42 - family
51:44 - so yeah 28
51:46 - definitely not too old
51:52 - let's see
51:54 - uh mert says hi
51:56 - says i love free code cam awesome
51:59 - awesome thank you i love it too
52:01 - that's why i do this stuff uh so i mean
52:04 - i do have my own youtube channel i do
52:06 - some videos on there but as you all know
52:08 - like the
52:09 - the majority of my hours spent doing
52:11 - youtube software are spent with free
52:12 - code camp
52:14 - um
52:15 - so i think it's i think it's something
52:16 - special i think it helps people
52:20 - uh edison says i studied three years in
52:22 - my country but then i came to the us and
52:24 - i had been working uh
52:27 - as a barber
52:28 - uh i love these two professions
52:31 - oh cool i have a lot of family members
52:33 - that are are barbers and hairdressers
52:35 - actually so i've got
52:38 - one uncle two great uncles
52:41 - and
52:42 - two cousins
52:44 - first cousins that are all
52:47 - barbers or and or hairdressers so
52:51 - uh
52:52 - definitely appreciate uh what it takes
52:55 - to do that job
52:58 - all right
52:59 - uh francis says
53:02 - have you tried php what can you say
53:04 - about it i have tried php uh and for
53:08 - this project in particular i've done a
53:10 - little php so all those custom post
53:12 - types you saw in in wordpress i created
53:15 - a plugin in php
53:17 - that
53:18 - creates those and some custom taxonomies
53:20 - as well
53:22 - so
53:23 - i
53:24 - i don't have a lot to say about php
53:27 - i can do a little bit when i need to in
53:29 - php it's not my preferred language
53:31 - but i mean like any language i think
53:34 - whatever language you work with the most
53:36 - is usually the one you're most
53:37 - comfortable with so i'm not that
53:39 - comfortable with it because i don't do
53:40 - that much um and i think you know from
53:43 - most languages can do most things right
53:46 - uh most your major languages so
53:49 - um it seems like the strengths and
53:50 - weaknesses of those languages are mostly
53:53 - felt kind of at the extremes uh where
53:56 - like you really need performance uh and
53:59 - then you you could start to see some
54:01 - differences
54:02 - um
54:04 - but for most things
54:06 - i think you know php is
54:08 - is as good as
54:10 - you know as good as anything else
54:12 - for me personally if i was getting into
54:14 - web development which i am in it now but
54:17 - you know if i was trying to pick you
54:18 - know as a beginner and trying to pick
54:19 - what to learn i personally would go with
54:22 - full stack javascript because my view on
54:24 - it is you only have so many
54:27 - you know hours in the day to learn
54:29 - um
54:31 - why not learn one language and be able
54:33 - to do two things with it right front end
54:35 - and back end
54:36 - then learn two different languages and
54:38 - since you got to know javascript for web
54:40 - development anyway
54:41 - why not just stick with it so and that's
54:43 - nothing against php
54:45 - uh it's just kind of a being really
54:48 - practical about it and trying to be as
54:50 - efficient as possible with my learning
54:53 - but if you do want to work with anything
54:55 - like wordpress which a ton of websites
54:57 - run on wordpress so there's definitely a
54:59 - market there
55:00 - then you're probably going to want to
55:01 - know php because that's what it's built
55:03 - on uh also if you want to work on drupal
55:06 - or joomla which are
55:09 - not as popular as wordpress but you
55:11 - still see them a lot uh those also run
55:14 - off php so it's definitely still
55:16 - valuable
55:17 - to learn
55:21 - let's see
55:26 - lawrence says uh do you know scratch and
55:29 - is it good oh yeah scratch um for those
55:32 - who don't know scratches it's like a
55:34 - visual programming language i believe it
55:37 - was developed at mit uh
55:40 - mainly to help teach kids programming so
55:43 - you have these tiny little colored
55:45 - blocks that represent different actions
55:47 - you can take in code so you have one for
55:49 - like a for loop
55:51 - um you have ones that represent
55:53 - variables um like iterators like you
55:56 - know different basic things uh while
55:58 - loops and you just
56:00 - click and drag the blocks over to where
56:03 - your code lives
56:05 - and um so you build the code like that
56:07 - instead of typing it out you click and
56:09 - drag these different colors so it's it's
56:11 - kind of easier for kids with little
56:13 - fingers you know and not quite uh don't
56:17 - really have the dexterity yet for a lot
56:18 - of typing
56:20 - um
56:21 - or the spelling skills really can still
56:24 - make some cool things in scratch and um
56:27 - there have been some people to do some
56:28 - pretty advanced things in scratch like
56:31 - usually like games and things
56:34 - so it's um
56:36 - i mean i i wouldn't do
56:38 - like a real project in scratch for a
56:41 - client or anything
56:42 - it's not a programming language like
56:44 - that but
56:45 - it's it's just another layer of
56:47 - abstraction uh geared towards making
56:50 - programming easier for
56:52 - uh for children so uh if you're just
56:55 - starting out
56:56 - starting with scratch is not a bad idea
56:59 - even if you're older
57:01 - i know harvard's computer science 50
57:03 - course starts you out in scratch the
57:05 - first assignment for that course
57:08 - is scratch and that course is geared
57:09 - towards people who are 18
57:12 - 19 20 like around that age range so
57:15 - um
57:17 - scratch is just a cool place to start to
57:19 - get an understanding of what are loops
57:21 - what are if statements and things like
57:23 - that
57:24 - without having to get having to get
57:25 - bogged down by all this syntax right so
57:29 - definitely awesome for kids but also
57:30 - awesome for adults who are just starting
57:33 - out in programming
57:35 - and it's just kind of fun right it's
57:37 - like if you just want to mess around and
57:38 - do something scratch is fun
57:48 - hammy says
57:49 - it's really good to see these people
57:51 - with different cultures gathered
57:52 - together by enthusiasm for coding
57:55 - um
57:56 - yeah definitely definitely i i know i'm
57:59 - i've talked about this before i'm sure
58:00 - but
58:01 - uh i think
58:03 - i think that there's really something
58:05 - special going on here with free code
58:07 - camp and with these live streams um
58:11 - in that
58:12 - like there's there's a community that's
58:14 - grown so like not everybody attends
58:17 - every live stream and that's fine
58:18 - because everybody has their own lives
58:20 - and priorities and i you know that's
58:22 - that's totally fine but like
58:24 - you know in general
58:26 - there's quite there are quite a few
58:28 - people who are regulars you know who you
58:30 - see
58:30 - you know from time to time in here that
58:32 - start to know each other that even start
58:34 - to work on projects together outside of
58:37 - this live stream
58:39 - that help each other out
58:41 - and
58:43 - that's awesome you know people have come
58:45 - into the chat and watched the streams
58:47 - and
58:48 - just been learning
58:49 - and then they've gone on interviews and
58:52 - then they've gotten job offers and
58:53 - started working and have kind of checked
58:56 - in throughout this whole process and
58:58 - updated us in in the chat so
59:01 - um
59:02 - i think that's cool people have shared
59:04 - like i i know i share a lot of my
59:05 - struggles with um
59:08 - uh with mental health and you know even
59:10 - physical health and things uh and i know
59:12 - some of you have shared as well so i
59:15 - and i know there are people from
59:16 - everywhere um
59:18 - a lot of different countries different
59:20 - cultures different uh religions
59:22 - different you know
59:24 - everything that you can be that's
59:25 - different
59:27 - from each other i i think we've seen it
59:29 - here and we all get along i mean i
59:32 - i almost never have to block someone or
59:36 - delete a comment or anything i i think
59:38 - it's
59:40 - i think it's amazing right there's a lot
59:41 - of haters on the internet and a lot of
59:43 - trolls but they don't they're not here
59:46 - they're not here they're good people
59:47 - here you are good people so um i
59:50 - appreciate that and it makes me want to
59:52 - keep doing this uh it makes me want to
59:54 - learn more so that this is useful for
59:56 - you all
59:57 - uh and and i can keep doing this so
60:02 - anyway
60:03 - anyway i'll keep going i'm not gonna
60:04 - dwell on it too much i just i i really
60:07 - appreciate this this community
60:13 - let's see
60:15 - um
60:18 - leandro says hi i'm uh from brazil i
60:21 - love free code cam awesome
60:23 - awesome
60:24 - uh that's cool they said free code camp
60:27 - is a huge thing we're doing a lot of
60:29 - stuff i'm just a very small part of that
60:35 - santiago says
60:37 - greetings from venezuela
60:39 - awesome
60:41 - thanks for watching
60:46 - my mommy says in the field of coding the
60:48 - journey of knowledge just never ends so
60:51 - true that's what i love about it
60:56 - uh phoenix says also uh you know
60:58 - right that hayley jones uh on twitter
61:01 - will put up her portfolio tomorrow oh
61:04 - okay awesome yeah i do i follow haley
61:06 - jones on twitter so
61:08 - really cool
61:13 - uh lauren says thanks for the answer but
61:15 - scratch is a good way to begin uh
61:19 - but is scratch a good way to begin
61:21 - javascript because uh i do it for two
61:23 - years now i don't really know
61:26 - two years i'm not sure if that's years
61:28 - or not but
61:29 - i don't really know how to go from
61:31 - scratch to java i did download
61:33 - grasshopper the new learn app i haven't
61:35 - had a chance to
61:37 - try grasshopper yet and
61:39 - by grasshopper that is the new app from
61:42 - google that helps you learn javascript
61:43 - correct
61:44 - um somebody let me know if i'm wrong on
61:46 - that uh
61:48 - i haven't tried it yet like i mentioned
61:50 - earlier i've just been kind of
61:52 - um
61:54 - in in rush mode here for this website
61:56 - launch so i haven't done anything on the
61:59 - side but i'd love to try it i think i've
62:01 - heard a lot of good things about it
62:02 - though so i think that may be a good way
62:04 - to go
62:06 - to get into javascript also
62:08 - you go through the free code camp
62:09 - curriculum so if you go to
62:11 - freecodecamp.org and you start it on
62:13 - that it'll start you out with html and
62:14 - css but
62:16 - then it'll ease you into javascript so
62:19 - that's a great way to learn as well it's
62:20 - not the only resource there are a lot of
62:22 - other resources out there but
62:24 - it's one that i myself went through i
62:26 - didn't finish all the free code camp but
62:28 - i did go through
62:29 - a bit of it and it definitely helped
62:34 - um
62:35 - lauren says uh i'm from belgium awesome
62:39 - awesome nikki's in belgium too
62:42 - uh great
62:44 - i love it i love having people from all
62:46 - over

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to migrate some more data so a little while ago we had a similar stream uh so the plan is i have a spreadsheet and each row in the spreadsheet represents a piece of data that we'd like to migrate from a sql server database to a mysql database and to get from one database to the other we're using two tools to help us out a little node script so node.js is it's a way to run javascript server side and then we're also using the wordpress rest api to get the data the rest of the way so node pulls the data out of the sql server database and then the wordpress api puts the data into the my sql database i might mess that up so sql server to my sequel but um that's the plan i'm i'm gonna win you ahead of time it's not the most exciting thing in the world but uh i think it's a an okay example of some things that may have to happen when you're migrating from an old system to a new system and you can't just write one script and have everything come over it just doesn't work like that all the time so we're gonna have to kind of pick through the data try to bring it over and in as big a chunks as we possibly can but we still need to bring it over in a way that we're going to be able to make sense of it all and and use it so we're going to switch back and forth between the the data table we're gonna modify our our node script uh and run it and then we're also gonna check on this is a website uh that we're ultimately building here so we're going to check on the old version of the website to try to figure out like is this data even live do we need it um and if it's still there in the website like what's the context of this data to give us a better idea of where we should put it in the new database so that's the plan my wife is messaging me uh on my other screen and um she's doing some coding she's doing the udacity frontend nanodegree so she's messed she's sending me screenshots of her code and messaging me she must not know i'm streaming all right so let me switch over to my screen here you can see this is what i was working on right before i started let me adjust this a little bit okay um i'm gonna check the live chat and then we'll get started hey everyone um all right cool looks like you're talking about a race that happened uh this weekend um oh matthew asked if she started the memory project yet she's on the memory project right now that's the one she's working on so um she's working on some some click handlers for the cards and that was it actually works for her in codepen but not locally on her machine so anyway uh i think she'll probably be able to figure it out and uh she's been doing a pretty good job of getting getting through it okay so i brought over here let me start my pomodoro session i'm gonna do 25 minutes of coding in this case data migration and then five minutes a question and answer and we're going to go back and forth i do have a meeting in less than an hour and a half now so if we get a ton of questions i may not be able to answer them all but we're well within our normal time range here of around an hour for a stream uh someone asked for the website for this pomodoro timer so i'm going to copy and paste it into the chat here if you click it and it doesn't work then please try copying and pasting it all right so i i found some data here's the data that i found here i did this is really small i kind of need to keep it small to be able to see the range but i'm i'm just going to explain a little bit about what's going on here i found some data here that has to do with um residence life so like the dorm rooms on campus where students live and things like that so i assume you know this may be able to be like its own section its own post type in the in the wordpress and in the database or maybe we can just tag it in with with something else but i need to know what category this goes in so that's why i i just searched for it here and i could see hey this is residence life so let's click it and see all right what section does this fall under so it actually looks like uh this is kind of its own section it it's uh like a top level here so it's dot edu slash residence life so um it we may be able to put this in its own section uh just want to see if we have it if it's even a kind of a top level link here because i'm not sure where it's linked from um i'm guessing it would be student life where it's linked from so i'm clicking in here if you know i might be able to put it under the student life like in the section with all that data that we brought over residence life does that guy take us to the same spot oh it does it does interesting maybe we'll do that then this would be a little bit easier uh than making a completely new new post type uh so what we'll do is we already have a section for stuff like this under student life and let me let me pull up the wordpress did i make this yeah i think this is it all right so we have a wordpress installation we've been putting all this data into and we can see i will make this a bit bigger for you all to see so we have all these different data types to keep things straight for us here and we need to find the one that's student life now the users who are going to be in charge of editing this very few users are going to see all of this it's it's a bit much right so most people only see maybe one or two types so it'll be much cleaner easier to edit i thought i had student life stuff student profile pages where we had student life pages there we are okay so we already have a bunch of student life pages and wow we we have quite a few we have three pages of student life pages looks like these are a lot of the student organizations okay wonderful i think this will fit well in there so here's what we need to do we need a few pieces of of information in order to make this script work so we need to know what the folder id is that this data lives in and we also need to know what the post type the slug is right for so it's like a unique identifier for that post type in this case it's going to be i student life page i believe it will be student life pages i think that's it we'll find out if i run it and it doesn't work then i'll know that's the wrong one and uh we need this id is 486. so let's plug in 486 we're going to save that uh quickly i'll just go over this uh basically we're using uh the sqlize to all right this doesn't we're all importing the stuff right so this doesn't come with um node.js by default right uh so we're using sqlize to help us interact with a sql database a little bit easier right and then we have our our sql query if it's a little bit different than you're used to uh sql has kind of different flavors depending on the type of sql database so a query for my sql may look slightly different than sql server but you can kind of figure out what's going on if you are familiar with sql basically we're just getting a little bit of we're specifying um what data we want from from where we want it so from what section of the database we wanted and this data length greater than zero just means i don't even want to bother pulling in any data that is is empty right it doesn't have any content at all right and in our case our contents html markup if it doesn't have markup i don't really want it and that's pretty much it then down here we're basically taking that data we're getting and we are creating posts in wordpress and then having them put into my sql database um and we're taking the the data that has a certain name in the mysql database and we're giving it a name that is more appropriate or i'm sorry in our sql server database we're giving it a name that's more appropriate for wordpress and my sequel and in fact i do want to get rid of this that was uh for a previous thing we were working on all right great that that looks uh oops accidentally hit a key that looks perfect let's now run this so we need to run um migrate.js all right it's doing something and let's stop that and we're going to check to to make sure that these got inserted so right now we have 50 items if i refresh and it's more than 50 then it works nope it didn't work all right so why did it not work probably because i put in the wrong post type so student life pages what did i put in wrong all right let's check what the post type is you know actually it may tell it may tell me here in the slug student life pages hmm that looks right so what did i do studnt live pages oh you know what i don't think it's plural anything it needs to be singular student life page right because each one of these is a post so i'm creating a new student life page that's that's the problem all right now let's check there we go now we have 67 items so we went from 50 to 67 that's our extra 17 items that we just added okay and so here we go these uh this it's it's supposed to be short for assisi heights so definitely gonna change that title before it shows up in uh anyone's search but uh that's uh that's basically the process that we go through now i can go in here i have all these selected and i'm going to remove it from the table don't worry though i have a copy of this this spreadsheet in case i accidentally remove stuff that i shouldn't but for this one trying to get rid of everything as soon as we pull it over and that way just visually it'll be very easy for me to see the progress uh and the rows go down and down and down okay i do i see a few questions in the chat so um if if any of you are new uh please be patient i'll i have a timer on right now when the timer goes off then i will go back to the chat and answer your questions okay here we we have some more things here i'm going to try to find something that doesn't require me to create a custom post type ah let's see these look like people lots of people and they don't work here are they alumni are they speakers yeah i don't think i think these may have been speakers distinguished speakers series okay i'm not sure where i want to put that right now and i know you probably can't see how small this is so i'm trying to read it out a bit um i can delete this some of these are just tiny they're just such tiny fragments of pieces of data we just don't need them let's see okay these look like residence halls residence life staff okay um is this what contact information or just general information so i think this can go in the same spot that we wanted in let's just verify uh and see here do we have information about residence halls here residence life residence halls yep so that's where these are each one of these residence halls will have its own page and some info and i believe that's where this is coming from okay great uh yeah so let's take this and grab this data and since we're going to send it to the same place all we need to do is change that folder id so this will be 537 so let's go up in here five three seven we'll save it nothing else needs to change and we'll run this again oh 20 of them the more i can get in per query the better once i did a query and we got like i don't know around 500 at once and that was that was awesome i think that was the biggest one that i've done so far all right great so we have those uh we should i know this will work but it's always good to verify uh not great to just you know get ahead of it yep now we're up to 87 items wonderful and so now we can remove these let's see yeah we can remove these from here i um i was not employed here at this university whenever uh the old site was built so i'm learning so much about the website now as i go through and get all this content there were like whole sections that i didn't even know existed uh let's see it looks like these are some more uh this these are more information are these guys all right these are just image galleries i'm gonna bring these over i'm not exactly sure we'll keep them i know some of the older images aren't great quality so we may want to replace them but uh better just to bring it over uh and this is three 539 is the section 539 so let's let's change that over here um 537. i brought 537 530 it looks like 536 could come over too i think i'll bring over 536 as well so let's do 539 save that run it and i'll do 536 as well save that run it wonderful we'll verify 97 items great now we can just delete all of this wonderful okay so this is the pattern this is what i i do when i'm on campus uh so usually i'm on campus two days a week in my office my pattern of working for the last few weeks has been try to squeeze in all my meetings into those two days a week so that takes up a lot of my time uh and then when i'm not doing that or taking care of like other tasks like paperwork and things that i usually only do in the office i'm doing this over and over again so i'm almost through i'm getting pretty happy about that so it probably doesn't really make for a great live stream to do this i hope you know i don't know maybe you get just kind of an appreciation for a way that you could handle something like this um but i'll do let me see what time it is all right so i'll do this for a few more minutes uh and then i'll see what kind of questions we have and then we'll go from there and you all let me know if you really want to see any more of this or you'd rather me get kind of go to questions keep it a shorter stream uh i would love i'd like right now to find some more student life things and just try to like chunk it together so we don't have to change every uh you know both pieces of data but uh i'm also not going to spend a bunch of time scrolling through here to try to find some data so let's see we have a baccalaureate 2015 image gallery i don't think we need that these are old 2015 and uh 2017 2015. so it looks like we have some things in here that we just we don't need to uh bring over these are all old so let's get rid of them this is 2016 2016 2014. actually let me yeah these are all together here for sure commencement general info yeah let's get rid of that commencement information yeah i don't need that because that's oops there we go yeah let's delete that um these conferences i'm not sure if they if they want these conferences like the details from past conferences or not maybe i'll just leave them for now and i'll ask my boss about it okay these all right so i recognize some of these names as people that work here okay i don't really want to try to sort out where all these people work and get them in the right spots so let's just keep on going oh conspiracy theories that sounds like a cool course that's crazy that's actually a course um let me see uh it's possible that these courses what happened i lost it um it's possible that those courses might be old and we can get rid of them oh you know what these are a bunch of old events as well i i don't know if the theater department would want to keep some old events uh just for students prospective students to see so maybe we'll i'll ask about those as well let's see all right looks like i can remove some of these two this makes me happy when i can just get rid of stuff because we're not going to bring it over uh let's see four six seven yeah all of these looks like they are uh listings for events that have happened at least a year ago get rid of it all i'm sure it doesn't matter to you and it seems boring but it feels amazing when i can just get rid of those because that means i don't even i don't have to do anything i don't have to create post types i don't have to migrate the data like it's just like hey it's it's done uh okay great you know maybe i might make this just a bit bigger because i know it's going to be hard for you all to see and it's most definitely um difficult for me to see let's see if i can just make this bigger in bulk come on let's get a 16. yay that's so much bigger and let me get a font that i like better you know what we we use roboto for everything we may as well use it for our spreadsheets right uh okay cool a little bit better i can still see all the data that i need so this is fine um so here we are academic organizations student clubs pilgrimage so this 469 looks like this could also go in that student life so let's let's pull that in uh six nine so 469 we're going to save that run it and verify so we're going to from 97 it should say 99 yep 99 awesome and this isn't the end of it like after i would do this i would then have to go in and make sure like are the titles okay you know a lot of the titles contain abbreviations and things that nobody's gonna understand so i gotta clean up the titles gotta make sure the slugs for the post types are uh are something that we can actually work with uh and fit nicely in a url uh sometimes one there'll be multiple posts and really we could condense it down into one so there's a lot of cleanup that happens as well afterwards this is just kind of the first step and let's see all right counseling looks like we got a nice chunk of data here for counseling health center all right let's do that i do you know what i i want to see counseling service i want to see what part of the website this is on so let's check the website again um i gotta go to the search i can never remember how to spell accounts cou and sel counseling service i just i don't want to get the wrong info because we have a counseling program where we teach people about counseling but we also have counseling services there we go wellness center my motherinlaw is actually a counselor here at the same university as i am counseling service is under wellness center okay and i bet the wellness center pages are under student life let's see is like health services counseling services yeah it's under student life so let's throw it let's throw it in there with student life 481 is what we want 481 and let's migrate it down the road if we ever you know end up seeing like wow this this post type has way too many posts in it it's huge we can always break it out into into separate ones but right we don't want to optimize too much early right it's it can be at you know kind of a waste of time to do it too early and it may not even be necessary at all you know ever so we want to try to avoid that if we can so let's double check we'll verify and my timer is almost up so we'll do some question and answer here in just a few seconds all right awesome so that worked and the last thing we want to do before we forget is remove all of these posts that were um in that folder with the id of 481 all right delete great okay so i'm gonna set a five minute timer uh but i'm not sure i'm gonna go back and do another pomodoro session of just data migration you all let me know like how valuable this is to you i kind of i have to do this it's getting down like i can't put this off any longer i got to get the rest of the data in so i really need to make sure i get this done otherwise i would probably be streaming me doing something else maybe a little bit more fun uh so if you have a question please put it in the live chat now i just want to mention everyone uh i'm gonna go to the revolution conference in virginia beach uh later this week so i'll stream probably tomorrow if i can but then i i most likely will not be able to stream the rest of the week so wednesday thursday friday no streams if for some reason like maybe i can find some really good internet when i'm there then maybe i can do a stream but i i don't know beforehand so i can't really guarantee anything if anybody is in the virginia beach area and uh is either going to the conference that you know come come find me let me know that'd be awesome or if you're just in the area even if you're not going to the conference uh if you if you'd like to hang out or something let me know uh all right so i started i'm starting right at the top of the live chat i'm just going to scroll down try to answer the questions as they came in phoenix says hey hey how's it going phoenix good to see you see ezekiel says everyone something is going on with me okay ezekiel what's up what's going on all right teresa says thanks was it theresa that asks yeah all right theresa asked for the website though is it teresa am i pronouncing that right if not please let me know but anyway teresa you're welcome abdul aziz is here how's it going thanks for watching let's see her mommy says hi how's it going uh not bad no i'm i'm starting to get a little nervous and um like like i don't know nervous slash excited about launching the site so um that's how it's going for me how are you doing hey ann is here hey anna how's it going uh chris asked if i've tried out css grid yet i've done really minimal work with css grid so i don't honestly at this point my knowledge of css grade is so little like i i don't even want to try to explain anything about it to anyone yet because i i would probably mess it up but it's something i really do want to learn more about um there's so many tutorials and things that i'd like to do right now i just like since it's getting close to launch time for the site i'm everything is focused on that so i've i haven't even been like doing my usual i usually try to learn new things as i'm working like even if it's just a half hour a day but i've even cut that out so uh hopefully afterwards uh after it launches uh on june 4th hopefully i'll have a little bit more time for learning uh christian says jesse it is nice to see the real work you do also all right cool yeah i mean pretty much everything i stream is i mean it is things that i'm doing but i try to save the things that i think will be most exciting or uh like informative or helpful for you all uh so but i guess there's value in showing kind of like the tedious boring stuff sometimes too all right john's here he says hail uh of the finer repetitive details the doing is not so pretty the end product is the gem yeah i hope uh swadisi says good luck for that i i guess you're talking about my trip so thanks austin says i live in virginia beach come use my internet oh awesome awesome uh austin like if if you want i mean i you don't have to let me use your internet but if you're going to be in virginia beach if you're interested in trying like meeting up getting a coffee or something at some point um let me know uh you can i think my link to my twitter is in the description you know you can dm me if you want or whatever um you know so that that might be kind of cool if we could find a coffee shop that has decent wifi we might be able to do a little stream or something i don't know sometimes coffee shops aren't great for a stream if there's a lot of people the background noise is insane but um anyway i i'm down to hang out i don't know how much time i'll have because it will be conference stuff all the time but uh i'll i will try to work it out all right we have greetings from ukraine and you know let me grab uh that's in um cyrillic but i'm gonna use google translate to figure out what that is ivan okay so ivan says greetings from ukraine greetings ivan thank you and thanks for watching uh and it says any news um i guess if i'm assuming you were here when i talked about the conference i'm going to so i won't repeat that but other than that i don't think any news not really i i mentioned before i've been on a diet and i've been trying to exercise and that's going well i'm continuing to lose weight so i'm happy about that i have a lot more energy yeah so that's that's pretty good all right how many says i'm doing fine thanks i have started learning es6 uh or is it still early um i'm not i'm not here are you asking me if i started learning es6 or if you should start learning es6 uh i guess i can answer both so i do know quite a bit of es6 uh i don't i don't really use all of es6 all the time so i you forget what you don't use right but um you know there are some parts of es6 that i use like every day like arrow functions oh how memes is both of us okay cool yeah like i mean even especially when we're doing react like we're using arrow functions all the time uh i believe like map filter sort those things i think are es6 uh template literals love template literal syntax use that a lot let cons those are es6 uh so yeah so i mean there is a good chunk of es6 that you know i we use all the time um but there are certainly some things that you know we don't use trying what else um object destructuring so i mean there's their thing i think it's getting to the point now where people could potentially be using es6 and not even realize that it's es6 because it's just getting so um kind of blended in with what people are doing tutorials are using it so which is good right i mean we're already on es8 es6 been around for a while like i i think it will start to get even more and more like normal browser support a lot of it now so um anyway i i love uh all the parts of es6 that i use frequently are just there's just very helpful if you're not sure what es6 is it's also called es2015 there are some new features that were added to the javascript language um way back in uh like 2015 i don't know exactly when they were added but around there and uh you know with with transpilers you know people started using them before they were even official um so anyway that's what we talked about when we're saying yes es6 and yes 2015. so if you want to know what those what exactly was added you know try searching es6 uh i you should be able to find something probably on that first page of results that'll go through it uh let's see phoenix says hey jesse just wanted to ask what average salary can a guy in india expect for remote work in u.s let's consider a fulltime frontend developer job all right well that's it's going to be a little bit hard for me to answer that because you know certainly i would think like a com companies here in the united states uh when they look at how to to compensate a remote worker what they usually do at least here in the united states is they say okay what is a fair wage for where that person lives so for instance uh in the united states in san francisco cost of living is really really high like amazingly high it's just astounding to me how much you know uh for instance like houses cost out there so let's just say i'm i'm just kind of making these numbers up let's just say the average frontend developer in san francisco makes 150 000 a year if i were to get a job with a company but stay where i'm at and work remotely even if that company's headquartered in san francisco they're going to look at my market and they're going to say wow um that's a really economically depressed area you can make a living off you know much les excuse me much it takes much less to you know raise a family and get a house and everything where i'm at so they made say like okay we're going to pay you 80 000 a year um so you got to take that into consideration so i don't know what they would do they might take into account your standard of living i would imagine you could probably end up getting a little bit more um you know a company i think that's headquartered in an expensive area is still most likely going to be a bit more willing to pay more because they're used to paying more for you know their employees where they're at but in terms of giving a number i don't really know i know um like in in pittsburgh the closest big city to me is pittsburgh and i know in pittsburgh for um like uh the front end full stack um engineer you're looking at like minimum basically like i i would never take a job for less than like 75 000 a year in pittsburgh anything below that it's kind of like i just wonder if the company is really willing to put forth resources to make a good product if that's what they're willing they either one like have no idea what developers are worth um or which is bad or two they they don't care enough or don't have enough money to really put into a project to make it succeed so either way i don't really want to be working there uh so i my bare minimum would be like 75 000 a year and um then i would consider something like in the 90s would be a good offer uh you know so anything over 90 000 would what i would consider to be a really good offer and so the kind of the midrange would be between 75 and 90. uh and that's u.s dollars per year and if we're talking so that's pittsburgh if we're talking san francisco i don't know add like 30 000 on to those figures because it's it's much more expensive new york's pretty expensive uh san francisco as far as i know is the most expensive place in the u.s um new york's also up there as being pretty expensive as well i'm not sure how to pronounce that please correct me uh if i'm pronouncing it wrong but anyway they say hey i'm learning i'm new to learning node i want to show data from the console to web page using body parser but i can't hmm all right so let me check my time see how i can answer this let's tell you truth i'm not sure right off the bat with the answer the only time i use body parser is uh when i'm grabbing data from um an html form and i want to do things with that data in node um so i've never dealt with that specific use case i'm trying to uh i'm trying to get some resources i could uh maybe point you to i'm not sure if anybody in here has worked with something similar a node please let us know in the live chat uh otherwise i'm gonna try to keep thinking of it if i could think of something before the stream's over i would definitely mention it but like i said i i haven't dealt with a specific situation so i'm not i'm not exactly sure okay how many says i'm doing a course on udemy that focuses a lot on es6 okay so that was why the the other question with the es6 uh it says it's called mobile web specialists and focuses also on service workers all right cool service workers are amazing um we're working with service workers in this project as well but a lot of it is set up behind the scenes already by uh by next js which we're using so we don't have to directly deal with them but it it a service worker can sit between the client and the server and intercept network data and do things with it so it could essentially it could cache data and then the client uh client's network call goes out like normal but it doesn't go any further because the service worker will say oh they want this data we already have a cache just send it back and then you have like zero second load times because the data is right there because the service worker actually lives in the browser right so it doesn't have to go anywhere it doesn't even have to leave the browser so really cool um really cool things you can also do things like um calculations that would normally like crush uh your uh performance like in the dom you know scrolling and if you make everything all janky you could offload it to a service worker do all the calculations there and not uh mess up uh you know your flow um basically it wouldn't render block at all it wouldn't block the normal stuff that needs to happen on the page so that would that'd be pretty cool if you were going to do like i don't know like image processing somebody uploads an image you want to do some really like uh intense intent uh resource intensive things to it uh handle that in a service worker and then the user can still scroll around your page while that's doing its thing okay nikki says es6 is the language itself now meaning javascript it's in the official spec when learning javascript you also learn es6 now automatically unless you're learning old material okay that's that's pretty cool i didn't even think about that but yeah i mean when i went through the basic tutorials of javascript es6 was still um well early on it wasn't out yet and then later on it was still really kind of new so you didn't it just wasn't there uh but that's cool that it's a part of the tutorials now i mean that's i think as it should be right because there are some things that were a lot harder to do before es6 uh and i i don't see that much value in making a new uh you know learner do it the harder way when you know not even the advanced people are doing it like that anymore uh so yeah i i think that's good that they're teaching it like that um ivan says asks if i'm using something else other than react in the front end or if i now i mean i've been using react for most of the projects uh it's it's not that i have anything against the other stuff it's just um i'm kind of taking the approach right now that i'd rather get really good at one thing than try to know a little bit about all the things um so i i have to give up on some things that i think are really cool but it's it's for the sake of trying to make ultimately a better product so i've chosen react and so for the time being i'm pretty much just building things in react and if i'm not using react that means it's simple enough that i can just build it with just plain javascript um yeah so that's where i'm at right now we do have some other videos on the free code camp channel using things like vue and angular so you could check the the backlog of videos and uh and see some other things as well so we're not we're not like just just react but for me personally i'm using a lot of react i've been asked if i'm the creator of free code camp no uh so quincy uh i y'all know i don't know if you all know quincy um so quincy created uh free code camp he is the founder and he is um the i don't know what is his title president i'm not let me look him up on twitter to see what his title is because i'm not sure quincy's so humble his twitter says teacher at free code cam he's in charge of it all so um anyway quincy larson uh is who you want so if you want to follow him on twitter it's at aussia ossia uh anyway he's very very awesome guy um so yeah he's the one that started i my involvement with free code camp is pretty limited to these live streams on youtube i've talked with some of the other people from free code camp and had some like video chats and things but uh there are a ton of other people that work on various areas of free code camp so uh there's a lot of people behind the scenes that nobody even knows about that are making this happen and uh working for free too i mean almost all the stuff that gets done on free code camp is is from volunteer time let's see um ed edison so edi cson says hi there i'm 28 am i too old to be a programmer what do you think uh no definitely not too old uh not so you're never too old to be a programmer i've seen stories of people a lot older switching careers learning how to become a programmer and get having successful programming careers so i am 32 years old uh i taught high school for for a little while in my mid20s and um then i switched into programming in my late 20s so i had i learned a little bit before that but i really kind of got serious about it and switched into it late 20s and i'm employed now as a fulltime frontend developer uh i i don't know how successful you would consider me but i make enough money to support my family and pay my bills uh so um i mean i have four kids i have a wife so i i'd say that's uh you know it's pretty successful right i mean i'm not um not making millions or anything but i certainly can support myself and my family so yeah 28 definitely not too old let's see uh mert says hi says i love free code cam awesome awesome thank you i love it too that's why i do this stuff uh so i mean i do have my own youtube channel i do some videos on there but as you all know like the the majority of my hours spent doing youtube software are spent with free code camp um so i think it's i think it's something special i think it helps people uh edison says i studied three years in my country but then i came to the us and i had been working uh as a barber uh i love these two professions oh cool i have a lot of family members that are are barbers and hairdressers actually so i've got one uncle two great uncles and two cousins first cousins that are all barbers or and or hairdressers so uh definitely appreciate uh what it takes to do that job all right uh francis says have you tried php what can you say about it i have tried php uh and for this project in particular i've done a little php so all those custom post types you saw in in wordpress i created a plugin in php that creates those and some custom taxonomies as well so i i don't have a lot to say about php i can do a little bit when i need to in php it's not my preferred language but i mean like any language i think whatever language you work with the most is usually the one you're most comfortable with so i'm not that comfortable with it because i don't do that much um and i think you know from most languages can do most things right uh most your major languages so um it seems like the strengths and weaknesses of those languages are mostly felt kind of at the extremes uh where like you really need performance uh and then you you could start to see some differences um but for most things i think you know php is is as good as you know as good as anything else for me personally if i was getting into web development which i am in it now but you know if i was trying to pick you know as a beginner and trying to pick what to learn i personally would go with full stack javascript because my view on it is you only have so many you know hours in the day to learn um why not learn one language and be able to do two things with it right front end and back end then learn two different languages and since you got to know javascript for web development anyway why not just stick with it so and that's nothing against php uh it's just kind of a being really practical about it and trying to be as efficient as possible with my learning but if you do want to work with anything like wordpress which a ton of websites run on wordpress so there's definitely a market there then you're probably going to want to know php because that's what it's built on uh also if you want to work on drupal or joomla which are not as popular as wordpress but you still see them a lot uh those also run off php so it's definitely still valuable to learn let's see lawrence says uh do you know scratch and is it good oh yeah scratch um for those who don't know scratches it's like a visual programming language i believe it was developed at mit uh mainly to help teach kids programming so you have these tiny little colored blocks that represent different actions you can take in code so you have one for like a for loop um you have ones that represent variables um like iterators like you know different basic things uh while loops and you just click and drag the blocks over to where your code lives and um so you build the code like that instead of typing it out you click and drag these different colors so it's it's kind of easier for kids with little fingers you know and not quite uh don't really have the dexterity yet for a lot of typing um or the spelling skills really can still make some cool things in scratch and um there have been some people to do some pretty advanced things in scratch like usually like games and things so it's um i mean i i wouldn't do like a real project in scratch for a client or anything it's not a programming language like that but it's it's just another layer of abstraction uh geared towards making programming easier for uh for children so uh if you're just starting out starting with scratch is not a bad idea even if you're older i know harvard's computer science 50 course starts you out in scratch the first assignment for that course is scratch and that course is geared towards people who are 18 19 20 like around that age range so um scratch is just a cool place to start to get an understanding of what are loops what are if statements and things like that without having to get having to get bogged down by all this syntax right so definitely awesome for kids but also awesome for adults who are just starting out in programming and it's just kind of fun right it's like if you just want to mess around and do something scratch is fun hammy says it's really good to see these people with different cultures gathered together by enthusiasm for coding um yeah definitely definitely i i know i'm i've talked about this before i'm sure but uh i think i think that there's really something special going on here with free code camp and with these live streams um in that like there's there's a community that's grown so like not everybody attends every live stream and that's fine because everybody has their own lives and priorities and i you know that's that's totally fine but like you know in general there's quite there are quite a few people who are regulars you know who you see you know from time to time in here that start to know each other that even start to work on projects together outside of this live stream that help each other out and that's awesome you know people have come into the chat and watched the streams and just been learning and then they've gone on interviews and then they've gotten job offers and started working and have kind of checked in throughout this whole process and updated us in in the chat so um i think that's cool people have shared like i i know i share a lot of my struggles with um uh with mental health and you know even physical health and things uh and i know some of you have shared as well so i and i know there are people from everywhere um a lot of different countries different cultures different uh religions different you know everything that you can be that's different from each other i i think we've seen it here and we all get along i mean i i almost never have to block someone or delete a comment or anything i i think it's i think it's amazing right there's a lot of haters on the internet and a lot of trolls but they don't they're not here they're not here they're good people here you are good people so um i appreciate that and it makes me want to keep doing this uh it makes me want to learn more so that this is useful for you all uh and and i can keep doing this so anyway anyway i'll keep going i'm not gonna dwell on it too much i just i i really appreciate this this community let's see um leandro says hi i'm uh from brazil i love free code cam awesome awesome uh that's cool they said free code camp is a huge thing we're doing a lot of stuff i'm just a very small part of that santiago says greetings from venezuela awesome thanks for watching my mommy says in the field of coding the journey of knowledge just never ends so true that's what i love about it uh phoenix says also uh you know right that hayley jones uh on twitter will put up her portfolio tomorrow oh okay awesome yeah i do i follow haley jones on twitter so really cool uh lauren says thanks for the answer but scratch is a good way to begin uh but is scratch a good way to begin javascript because uh i do it for two years now i don't really know two years i'm not sure if that's years or not but i don't really know how to go from scratch to java i did download grasshopper the new learn app i haven't had a chance to try grasshopper yet and by grasshopper that is the new app from google that helps you learn javascript correct um somebody let me know if i'm wrong on that uh i haven't tried it yet like i mentioned earlier i've just been kind of um in in rush mode here for this website launch so i haven't done anything on the side but i'd love to try it i think i've heard a lot of good things about it though so i think that may be a good way to go to get into javascript also you go through the free code camp curriculum so if you go to freecodecamp.org and you start it on that it'll start you out with html and css but then it'll ease you into javascript so that's a great way to learn as well it's not the only resource there are a lot of other resources out there but it's one that i myself went through i didn't finish all the free code camp but i did go through a bit of it and it definitely helped um lauren says uh i'm from belgium awesome awesome nikki's in belgium too uh great i love it i love having people from all over now mimi says have to go now happy coding hey see ya mommy have a great day glad you could join us all right and i believe that that's it that's uh that's the end of the live chat so uh unless someone sneaks another question in there in the next uh you know 30 seconds or so i think we're going to wrap things up uh thank you all so much for watching i know it was a little bit uh maybe boring with the data stuff so uh hopefully i won't need to do any more streams with that and i'll get all this finished soon uh but anyway um like i mentioned earlier i will try my best to stream tomorrow but then the rest of the week after that i will be at a conference probably won't be able to stream and um let me know if you're in virginia beach uh and so maybe we could you know hang out or something uh wednesday thursday friday of this week i'll be i'll be in virginia beach so at the revolution conference so um i guess i'll see y'all tomorrow and until then have a great day
