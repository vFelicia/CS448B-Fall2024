hey everyone my name is Eric I'm a member here on the scratch team I'm so excited to show you scratch teacher accounts so these are accounts that allow you to more easily manage your class on scratch through a number of new features which we'll show you in this video so we'll start by assuming you've already created a teacher account and remember it can take up to 24 hours for your teacher account to be confirmed so let's go ahead and start by logging into our teacher account so I'll log into mine teach visually okay great so we've landed on the homepage and you'll notice that we have a new purple Banner uh and in this purple Banner we have some helpful resources for teachers that are using scratch so let's start by looking at these three buttons let's start here to the right so we see teacher account frequently asked questions so this is a page that has questions and answers related to sort of anything and everything related to teacher accounts so check that out if you have any questions about sort of teacher account functionalities and things of the like so let's go ahead and check out the next button here which is Educator resources this is a wonderful new page we created that has a bunch of tutorials uh that you can use um for scratch with your students and also stories of folks like you who are using scratch in a variety of educational settings so definitely check out this page for more information great so let's talk about this third and last button here and that is the my classes so my classes is a space where you can find all the teacher features like opening a class managing a class adding students adding Studios and things like that so you can see we've landed on the my class page I've already created two classes here so Dutch 102 and world history but let's go ahead and create another class so I'll go ahead and add a new class by clicking the add new class button we can go ahead and give the class name let's call it scratch 101 and let's just for now write test for this class the class description and we'll go ahead and we'll add the class great and you can see that we successfully added the class and we're presented with a number of options here so we can go ahead and change the icon of the class which will appear on the class page we can change what the class is working on and if we want we can end the class probably doesn't make sense to do that now but what happens is when you end a class students will effectively no longer be able to log into their accounts to access the class but we probably shouldn't do that now but no you can also reopen the class at any point in the future um let's talk about uh adding students to a class because so what is a class without adding students so we'll go ahead to the students tab here uh and you'll be happy to know that with scratch teacher accounts we've added a number of new ways for you to to add students multiple students at a time so we'll talk about the different ways in which you can add multiple students uh let's start with the student signup link so if we click this we can generate a link that our students can follow to create their accounts that will automatically be added to our class so if we go ahead and click that generate button it will create a link for us and then let's go ahead and check out this this link to see what it looks like so again I'll open up a new window here we'll send this over to the students in our class and they'll see something like this which is a signup page uh and then they can say okay do you want to join the scr uh the class scratch 101 sure let's get started they'll put in a username they'll put in a password and they'll continue on to create their account great and another way in which we can add students is through a CSV upload so we click the CSV upload button here and if you're not familiar with the CSV it's just a text file with a list of items uh separated by commas so you can see an example of a CSV file that you would use to create accounts is the uh the username of the account you want to create followed by a comma and then the password of that account uh and so we have an example here that you can download uh and you can start adding your accounts that way if you want I did that earlier and created a CSV let's pull it up so we can see here I have like one account I want to create create is goo loves dancing 5 comma the password for that account so I'm going to create three accounts here I'll go ahead save that file and then we'll go here to choose the file the CSV that we have cool and then I'll hit that big old upload button now let's see uh oh okay so we ran into an error it says Row three username already exists so please update the CSV file so let's go back to our CSV file so Row three one two 3 speak visually so that's actually my account that I own so I I'll go ahead let's remove this row this account uh from our CSV or if we wanted we could change the username uh just make sure that it doesn't already exist on the scratch website so I'll just go ahead and delete that let's just try to add two accounts here so I'll hit save now uh it's already there uploaded so I'll just go ahead and hit upload great and so there we have it we created two accounts uh here uh for our scratch 101 class now there's another way in which you can add students uh you can add them individually so we can hit this button here the new student button to add individual accounts so let's go ahead and say goo loves dancing six okay so we can create this account so you notice we weren't prompted to put in a password this account will take on the password of the teacher's username so in this case it' be capital T teach capital V visually awesome so we have our three accounts here for our scratch one one class let's go ahead and check out some of the account settings uh for our student accounts so you'll notice in this we have multiple ways to help a student sort of change their password one we can manually change the student's password by clicking this button so we can go ahead and give a new password to the student another one is we can have the student's password be reset to your username so in this case it' be teach visually and then they would use that password teach visually to log in and when they log in they would be requested to then create a new password and we also have the ability to remove an icon uh from a student if we so choose so great so those are some of the settings that we have for the students in our class let's go ahead now and check out uh the way in which we can create Studios for our class so we can go ahead and click this tab Studios uh and we can create a new class Studio which is very similar to a studio that you would create on the scratch website except when you create these Studios your students will automatically be added as curators to the studio so we can go ahead create uh a new studio let's call it scratch 101 Week 1 uh and really quickly we'll just have the studio description test uh and then you can see there we have it we created a new class studio and again our students will be curators of that studio cool so we've talked about settings we've talked about how how to add students how to manage students how to create Studios let's peek at this which is activity so this is the activity for the class we noticed we don't have much activity let's go ahead and check out another class that I have that probably has a bit more activity so we can go to the world history class that I have uh let's check out the activity and we can see that uh some of my students have made uh shared projects or made updates to their profile uh and things like that great so let's also talk about some of the other features that we have as a teacher which is we can now actually moderate some of the actions of our students so if we go here it looks like goo loves dancing has uh created created a project and left a common on a project the project name is this is an inappropriate project so let's go ahead and check that out so uh as a scratch teacher account you can actually uh take moderation actions against things like this so uh we see Gobo love dancing said this is an inappropriate comment so we can go ahead if we want we can remove that comment from the website uh as long as it's uh has been left by your students so we can go ahead delete that comment are you sure you want to delete the comment yep so when you delete that comment it'll be removed from the website and the scratch moderation team will also be notified that you did this so they can check on check in and see what's happening uh and sort of similar uh you can do this for projects so if you see a project from one of your students that's inappropriate you can hit the report and unshare button uh and then you can leave a reason uh this project uh is inappropriate whoop I spelled inappropriate wrong not even close uh and so you can go ahead and click that uh and then the project will be unshared from the website but will remain in their my stuff and the scratch moderation team will be alerted so we've been looking at all of this from sort of the teacher point of view but now let's log in as a student to see what looks the same and what looks different so let's go ahead and log out and we'll grab one of our new accounts that we created uh which is Tera loves dance Dan in six uh let's reference our CSV here uh it's actually teror loves dancing 5 and the password is two so password two so you can see uh if I log in for the first time I am asked to sort of get started here I was invited to the class I'll go ahead get started uh It'll ask you for your birth month and date so let's go ahead give that okay and then we'll choose gender and Country great okay and then we'll go to the class let's see what looks any different so we see we've landed on the scratch 101 class page this might be the first time you've seen something like this so this is the the name of the name of the class you see it's a class page this was the uh the about the class what the class is working on this is that studio that we created uh and you can check out all the students here so you can see us there so let's check out one of these student accounts and we can also see that here's a fellow student of mine in in the class and we can see that it is automatically following the teacher and all the other students uh and you can also see here on the student page or on the profile page there's a link uh to the class uh that's one way to get to it you can also go um to this and uh your settings and go to my classes to be led to the class page so that's pretty much the overview of scratch teacher accounts we are so excited to have these launched and to see uh to see what you all do with them uh if you have any questions about scratch teacher accounts I would encourage you to check out the frequently asked questions uh enjoy and scratch on
