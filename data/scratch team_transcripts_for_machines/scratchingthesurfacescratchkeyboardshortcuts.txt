foreign shortcuts are a great way to help us create and work faster in scratch when creating this caterpillar Sprite I can select multiple objects by holding down shift I can use command C and command V on a Mac and Ctrl C and Ctrl V on Windows to copy and paste my selected element but if I wanted to control where the new copy ends up once selected I can hold down option on Mac and ALT on Windows and drag to create a whole new element and place it exactly where we want it to go but if I make a mistake and add too many legs in my caterpillar Sprite I can simply use command Z on Mac or Ctrl Z on Windows to undo my last move we're just scratching the surface of keyboard shortcuts which shortcut will you use next
