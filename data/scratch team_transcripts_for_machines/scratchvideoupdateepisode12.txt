hi everyone welcome to another scratch video update I'm Rick girls also known as for girls on scratch and I am Eric also known as visually on scratch and welcome to episode 12 welcome to episode 12 it's been a while so doesn't episode that is again regrets it isn't as an episode oh and we're a little behind schedule i think y'all were probably expecting this maybe two weeks ago sorry about that all right there but we have an amazing episode fell for you yes so what's that I think the first segment it is love it okay cool i remember that so this is a section where we talk about projects time the white claps projects that we loved in the community and so one that I loved was about it was sort of like an infomercial for a fake product I think it's fake and it's called Rudy pets and potato cat and so it's sort of like I don't know this is pretty cute and so it's essentially a root vegetable that you have so the potato would be that you dress up like a pet and it's like this really compelling threeminute infomercial to buy your own and I think it's wonderful and we shall check it out so I don't think we love is this project by cinnabon girl 13 come it's a thriller dance tutorial so if you're not familiar with driller it's this great music video by michael jackson and there's these zombies coming out and doing this really awesome dances but how to do it no problem because center one girl 13 created a project that takes you stepbystep yeah it shows you what to do with every part of your body and soon you can also join the three they make it easy so i mentioned the first project for a new pet was by users 23 did i mention that i think so just to mention it again anyways two awesome projects they should check out and we have the links here in the forum description well next I'm gonna step back so i always get your face try so we got a lot of things to try a lot a lot of things to try so we're coming up on our of code now what's our account it a global event that happens starting december seven and anyone who's really interested in getting started coding or doing more coding activities can do this hour of code activity and there's different tutorials to try and we created yeah I guess who's jesse is participating so scratch we have created some cool little hour of code activities so one is on the homepage on moda scratch design studio is the Alice in Wonderland 150th year anniversary and so you can go ahead we have some cool sprites you can use that are Alice in Wonderland themed their vector so they're really easy to change and recolor and things like that but you can do whatever you want as long as it's sort of alice and wonderland theme so that's part of our hour of code of stuff another said are sometimes i'm going to seem like animate your name or dance and since we have a new set that fits on the we bare bears okay it's a cartoon from Cartoon Network and install these three bears grizzly Panda I spare and you can create your own hide and seek project using these three bears but also kind of build on and use any of the other excess you crazy absolutely i think there's actually a basketball tutorial with we bare bears as well there's a lot of we bare bears stuff it's a very cute show and I'm so happy that it's part of our code and so that we have a very they're always special but I think this is a very special message from the scratch team and so we're joining you in the middle of members week at the Media Lab and so the media lab I think we might have said this in an early episode episode the Media Lab is sort of a bunch of research groups here at MIT one in which contains lifelong kindergarten where is scratch Christopher educated and we're funded by some awesome companies and those awesome companies come to visit us twice a year and they check out what we're up to and it's a great opportunity to also just find out what's going on around them rigorous and I like to go around as well and we're not a company let's the scrags give you updates company which is which is not in any way we so we took we just have to take along you through a tour of the lab and so there's a few projects that we're going to highlight we did this last time before but we just did a lifelong kindergarten just how we went to different research groups around the lab so with that let's just see in a couple minutes everyone we're in the changing places research group and i'm here with irm tears Lobos project yeah sure happy to so what we have here is a rapid prototyping interface for City Planning and we used tagged Lego objects very lowtech just like us on the bottom there's a color code but if we place it on our table we can detect it in real time and then project information about that building onto the building so what you see here is yellow residential units of this building and in red not office units and you can place it anywhere so over here you see a whole line of residential housing that we built in a row and if we run our simulation you can actually see a heat map that tells us about walkability and in red you see areas where walkability is not so good and in green you see areas where walk abilities is better what you can say about this is if you live here in these green areas you have great you can walk to your job you can walk to your amenities you can get to where you need to without getting in a car but in these areas here if you live here everything's pretty far away so let's see if we can fix that using our little lego model I'm going to put some office buildings nearby and some restaurants and maybe a gym and that makes us housing much more amenable to people going to walk as a primary mode of transportation well thanks for having us i remember i keep walking around castell de again so we're back at home base and lifelong kindergarten and one less thing that we're going to show you is by Jennifer thank you hey guys so I'm working on a tool that makes it easier for you to draw with programming but instead of program with blocks with text we're programming by selecting object so as long as I created by creating relationships between these different shapes and our copy I can do cool things like rotated to get a different take important and go and modify the color one of these objects you know get this gradation in a pattern and I can just experiment with different designs that i like until I get something I think it's cool so this is a easy way to get started using programming to create cool patterns and shapes thank you cool so well anyway you look to it hey oh that's really cool it is so inspiring to see the new things that are happening around the lab absolutely so I think that ends our end of the episode yeah we'll pull you back again and episode 13 whoa for the year ends before the year ends episode 13 get ready hi everyone scratch on
