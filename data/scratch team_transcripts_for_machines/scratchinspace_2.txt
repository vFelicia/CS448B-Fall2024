everyone its feet visually here from the scratch team at MIT and I have something to share with you something pretty cool so imagine this imagine you're creating a scratch project for space so the person playing it is floating around what would you create maybe a game where they float and they collect coins or maybe it's an animation where they're flying through the sky it sounds pretty surreal but here's the thing I have been invited yes this is true I haven't been invited to attend a zero gravity flight where I will experience the weightlessness of those in space so imagine astronauts that are floating in the International Space Station or anyone else in space so I will be floating around on this flight and even cooler I will be able to play scratch projects yes that is right I will be able to play scratch projects as I float around and we're inviting you to create scratch scratch projects for this special event we have a couple things that we want to share with you one is I will not be able to touch the keyboard when I am on this gyro gravity flight so how could you how could you play with a scratch project well we ask that you use video sensing blocks and if you're not familiar those blocks allow someone using the webcam to interact with scratch projects so here's a scratch project where we're using video sensing blocks to save the Lego minifigs as they fall and don't worry if you haven't used many if you haven't used minifigs if you haven't used video sensing before I've created a tutorial that will explain how you might use those blocks second thing to keep in mind is the plane is kind of small that'll be on so I actually only have about five feet of space from left to right to move around about seven feet to go up and down and I'll be about six to eight feet behind the laptop so not a whole bunch of room to move around and play with these scratch projects but a lot of room to I think experiment with and play with the third thing to keep in mind is I will only experience weightlessness in sort of twenty to thirty second chunks of time so when you create a project think about a game or an animation that takes roughly twenty to thirty seconds and so that's the gist of this initiative we are super super super excited to see what you create and if you have any questions check out the studio description or feel free to ask fellow people who are submitting projects to this initiative and we cannot wait to see what you create sketch on
