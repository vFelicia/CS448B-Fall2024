The Loudness Block gives high numbers if I on it while I'm being pretty loud and lower numbers if I'm being quieter. If I go to the Motion Section and get a Set Y Block and put this Loudness Block inside it then when I click on it and I'm being loud my sprite is going to be high up, if I'm being quieter, it's going to go further down. I could also go to the Control Section and get a Forever Block. If I click on this it'll keep updating the Y value based on my loudness. Another thing I can do is go to the Events Section and get this When Loudness is Greater Than Block. Maybe I want this to only run when I'm being pretty loud, greater than 50. And let's say I want the rabbit to change to it's next costume and make a magic sound. Now when I clap my hands... [hand clap] It transforms! What will you create with the Loudness Block?
