I'm pretty sure my first project was about moving from a ball I just made a chicken moving and then after that I made a horse moving and then I slowly started making a little like talking animation one project I'm really working on a lot is it's called hash tag hash browns it's another show I'm making and I got the idea from my friends at school we had food names so my name was like ah be the Acorn I'm right now working on ten projects I'm working on three games and seven animations most of them are from my dream sometimes in my dreams there's something weird happens in it and I just mainly wake up in the night I just write on a piece of paper and then in the morning I would go and scratch and I would like draw some things that I thought was on the paper if everything about scratch is the community because they're really nice and they're really helpful to me even if like the project like you don't really think it's that good everyone would encourage you so that's why I'm always like happy to share em every project that's in my dream you
