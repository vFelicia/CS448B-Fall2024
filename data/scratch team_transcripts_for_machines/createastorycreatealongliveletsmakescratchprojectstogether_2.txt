um okay yes we have 22 viewers now hello everyone uh welcome back in um i think maybe i'll uh pick up now um yeah i think i think we'll just resume here uh like youtube never interrupted our stream but that's that's fine we're all figuring things out here uh so okay where were we uh where we were was that i was telling you that today the prompt of today is uh creating a story uh so the idea is that you can make a a story of any kind i'm not sure when the stream uh broke off so i'm not sure if i'm repeating myself uh so let me you can send me in the google form if uh if i'm repeating myself too much but basically the idea of today is that you can make absolutely any kind of story you could interpret it in any direction the uh making characters talk to each other um making uh uh like uh a character just go between multiple backgrounds it could be a totally random story i'm gonna show you how to do a random story with two uh objects from my house um and uh yeah that is the idea for today um but i will start by uh showing you how to um open up scratch and make a scratch studio um and thank you everyone so much for bearing with the technical difficulties i'm glad we got the stream back going and we've got lots of you here i hope more people will keep joining um so uh edit um all right so uh let me show you how to open up scratch.mit.edu uh so let me switch to uh showing the url so you're gonna go to uh scratch.mit.edu uh and then uh you're going to uh go to uh this link up here that says create uh just click on that and you can also go to this url scratch.mit.edu create i'll keep this url up for a few moments but i will try not to keep it up for too long uh the i know every past time i have forgotten and left the url up it's all the learning process here we're uh we're figuring it all out um so yes scratch.mit.edu create and that will open up uh this page which is the uh scratch editor um so uh the scratch editor in case you haven't seen it before or if it's been a while um i'll give you just a little uh uh explanation of sort of how it works and then i'll show you how to start making a story also if you're already you know ready to get started on your creative story project you could totally do that um but for anybody who would like to here's a little explanation of scratch so in scratch you have these uh characters uh down here right now we have just the one this cat and you have all these blocks over here on the left that you can click on to make the characters do things so this one uh says turn 15 degrees and when i click on it the cat is a turn and a turn um so you can drag these this is sort of like the menu of options you can pick from there's tons of them and you can drag that into here to sort of work with with these blocks so you know here i can click it have the cat turn uh you can try out other ones this one says go to random position click on that and makes the cat go to a random position um and there's all these different categories these uh blocks are in the motion category so they're kind of affecting how the cat moves but there's other stuff like you can affect the looks of the cat so you can go down see what's here there's this one says change size by 10. you could click that and now we have a cat that is getting bigger um you can combine them so there's this block that says change color effect by 25 and so if i i now have attached it to this change size by 10 block and now if i click the both of them it gets bigger change the size by 10 and it changes the color uh by like 25 around the color wheel 25 degrees i think so or something like that so um anyway this great colorful cat we have that's like the basic idea of scratch which is you have all of these blocks that are things for characters to do and then if you have a character you can use the blocks and make them do these things and you can also this cat is the default character it comes with but you can also click on you know what i did that kind of fast and it's going to take a long time to go back because my computer is chugging but um and you know what maybe i hope you all have this link here that um uh scratch.mit.edu create and i will take it down now but if you do need a help still finding link if you join later in the stream uh just write into the google form and i'll put the link back up or i'll i'll tell it to you uh so hiding the link ha ha it's done uh so um the uh you you can hover over this button here that says choose a sprite click on that and add any character that you might like to you know you could add uh this character avery um walking next to this uh very large colorful cat um so you can and now you might wonder oh where did all of those blocks go that we put out for the scratch cat they only apply to the scratch cat so if you click on the scratch cat's little icon here then they didn't go anywhere you can see them right here um but avery we haven't made any any blocks for avery and these if we but if we now that we've clicked on avery if we put out blocks here they'll affect avery so you can drag out this block that says say hello for two seconds now if we click on that avery is the one who says hello so that's the basic basic idea of scratch um now how might one create a story in scratch well we happen to have a tutorial that is pretty useful for this it is actually called create a story um let me open up a new scratch project i'm just gonna go to scratch.mit.edu create to make a new scratch project um and if you're joining just now the stream welcome we had a little bit of technical difficulties but i think we're back on track thank you so much everybody for bearing with us as we learn what youtube does and does not consider a reason to cancel a live stream uh yes very grateful to everyone for bearing with as our uh you know you know this is just we were creating a story today of the story of how we made this live stream happen so you've all been part of the story um so uh yes but if you wanted to create a story in your scratch project open up this scratch project and uh you can click on tutorials this button up here and you'll get all these tutorials we have and right here uh we have create a story you can click on that and then this window will pop up you could watch the video the video will explain some stuff about creating a story um but you can also if you click this green arrow here you can walk through the steps of the tutorial so uh you can so this first step says to add a backdrop and i do think that's a nice uh first step for making a story uh i actually helped make this tutorial so i feel a little uh bad saying that's a great first step but i think it is a pretty good one uh so yeah you can hover over this choose a backdrop button and then uh pick any backdrop you would like if there's one that sort of sparks your imagination and you're like okay i want to tell a back a story where the backdrop is castle 3 or colorful city click on that one uh i'm not sure exactly what story i want to do yet but this one blue sky i feel like is a very good backdrop that could go to many many many kinds of stories um so i'll just pick that for now i like blue sky a lot um and so then you can click the next the arrow here to see the next steps the next one is add a character uh so let us hover over this button and click choose and we can add a character for our story and i think this is uh one place where you can be like okay uh what what kind of story do i want to do uh maybe um let's see uh you can i'll let you do the bat oh and i just saw a question coming in i have no story ideas can you help with prompts yes uh i i will i will help with prompts hi flower uh who sent that in um i will help with prompts uh very soon uh that's a great idea um so uh yes okay so we've added a character um and you know now uh let's go to the next step and so this one has is uh say something where to put this window i think that's an okay place to put it for now um so uh it says to uh okay purple uh say block it's gonna be the looks category because it sort of matches that color so uh say this one says say welcome oh you know what let me make the size a little bit bigger this one says you could have it say welcome to magic school but you can have it say whatever you want and now i have this bat here uh so uh maybe y'all have in the back we've got the bat in the cat uh so maybe i'll have the bat say um uh um how is your day scratch cat um yeah so now that that has a little bit of dialogue and then it also says you can add this uh yellow when green flag clicked block on top so that that matches this color so i will go in and add that and what that does is now uh you can click the green flag to make it happen and this is useful because you could have lots and lots of different characters doing things that start when the green flag is clicked so you can start all of that by just clicking the green flag if you add this uh when green flag clicked block to start the the this same block so that's the the first step of this create a story tutorial that i just wanted to walk through it um oh i just saw a question come in that i can answer pretty quickly that says how can you change the color of the sky it's a great question um and you click on the stage um so yeah the to change the color of the sky uh you can click on the stage here which is like where all the backdrops are stored and then right up here there's this backdrops tab so you can click on that and then you can click on this uh uh this chunk that is the sky and then you can go up here to this color section the color square and then change it to whatever color you want so maybe you want a bit of a more blue blue or maybe it's a sort of a sunset times or so you want like an orange um and yeah basically you can just uh grab any shape and uh and change its color up here so you can also so purple sky you can also click on this fill bucket and change the color so if you want a green sky uh you can do that so yeah that's how you can change the color of the sky make it your own um uh so let me so flower asked um can i help with story prompts yes uh let's see let's think of a few props and actually if you se if you want to send in prompts that you come up with you could send them to the to the google form um let's see you could uh uh tell that you could have uh a character that you love like uh uh maybe like explaining to another character like i i don't know uh their backstory or kind of yeah like their history or uh something like that you could show a flashback um from characters like past uh that's like a prompt idea you could you could i i know i often show this but i think it's it can be nice for just getting ideas going you can click a couple by hovering over this button here you can click uh surprise and create a couple of random characters and you can also add a hover over this choose a backdrop and click uh surprise here oh my gosh oh someone anyways and you can get like random backdrops and you're like okay so why is the knight in the bedroom with giga who looks very very happy um and a scratch cat and a bat that can be a place to get an idea um oh okay uh i've got a couple of story ideas coming in someone said you could make a story about a dog trying to learn how to swim i love that uh and uh story idea it's safe patrick's day and you see a little green hat i love that too uh so yeah oh okay someone says uh do a castle story i am a huge fan of castle stories uh okay someone says i have an idea for a prompt scratch cat accidentally hits a button that teleports them into real life i love that oh my gosh these are all so good uh oh uh tell a story about a unicorn adventure someone says thank you for sending in all these story ideas um uh flower and anybody who is still wondering about an idea i hope uh that you can uh hope these have given you some ideas but i'll keep coming saying more ideas and keep going uh someone also asks uh oh your questions are so wonderful i love answering all these questions someone asks can i make an interactive story yes you totally can um and i uh can show you some ways of of doing that um oh there are such good questions i want to get to them all okay so yeah um uh can you make an interactive story totally let me show you a few ways you could make a story interactive um so and and and maybe in case you're wondering what uh do we mean by like what's an interactive story i guess it's it would be some kind of story where the player can who's watching it uh can kind of affect the story in some way or control when something happens um so uh yeah uh the the the there's a couple sort of quick ways in scratch to make a story interactive so one is this wonderful block uh when space key pressed so right now i'm in the back i did this i did this code for the bat where uh it's it says when green flag clicked say how's your day scratch cat but you could have instead of having that happen happen when the green flag is clicked you could have that when a key is pressed so i could just detach that this from there and put it here and now trust me i'm gonna press the space key every time the player presses the space key this bat will say this um you could also uh have the um you know you you could have uh something a character say something when it is clicked this is another one of my favorite ways to make a story interactive like really easily um so you can uh you can i you know let me get another thing um another block you could have um maybe when the bat is we're still in the bat so when this sprite clicked uh we could have it say um like oh hello there so now every time i click on the bat it says a little thing it's sort of like interactive because it's responding to me um so those are some ways of making it interactive and i'll show one more that i really love um so uh let's let's there is this block in the uh sensing category uh and sensing is basically a category full of lots of blocks that uh can be used to make your project interactive i almost think it would be really fun to do a live stream where i just kind of explain like show lots of ways of using these because they're they're they all have it's really cool stuff they can do but i think until you see it used it can be i i didn't really know how to approach these vlogs but let me show you a way of using one of my favorite ones in this category so uh you can let's let's let's go to uh the scratch cat let's have the scratch cat do this um the scratch cat you can drag out this block um ask make it bigger um ask what's your name and wait uh so the the if once this gets clicked on the scratch cat will say like what's your name and then i can say uh zoey but it doesn't do anything after that but so where did my answer go it is stored in this little round block called answer and you can always click on these rounded blocks to see uh what what that thing is so right now answer is zoe because that's what i wrote but what's cool is you remember those say blocks from earlier you can actually put the answer block into a say block because it has the same rounded shape so it actually fits inside it so i can drag out it saying hello and then i can drag out it's saying it's just put in answer so let's do now so what's your name zoe hello zoe so it it does something sort of responding to what i wrote um so anyway that is another one of my favorite ways of making a project interactive um anyway thanks for the question oh okay couple other questions coming in uh someone asks um how can you make a sprite appear or disappear this is a great question and can be useful in so many stories um let me show you in a new project so i'm going to scratch.mit.edu create um and uh and welcome to anyone joining now uh this is the create a long uh live stream episode three uh we're making story projects in this time together uh so yeah you can make any kind of story um and then you'll be able to share it if you want to at the end um and you can send in your questions if you want any help getting started getting ideas and i'll answer them if i can um so opening up a new project um and this is to show how to make a character disappear or appear so in the we've got the scratch cat here in the looks category we have he scroll down there are these blocks uh let me make this bigger uh show and hide so you can click on them to see what they do if you click hide this character you can see this after this eye turns to being like invisible it can't be seen uh so you can and then if you click the show block it shows up again it's like visible so you can hide and show a character um and make it appear and disappear with these blocks but uh so that's how the blocks you'd use to make a character appear and disappear but possibly even more useful is let me show you how you could use this so um let's let's let's say you want let's say so let's add a couple of backdrops to our project because i'll show you how let's say you wanted the scratch cat to appear in one backdrop and then disappear when you go to another backdrop because say you want it to be in one scene of your story but not the other one i'll show you how to do that right now so to do that let's get a couple of backdrops okay one um you know someone mentioned doing a castle story before i love that so i'm going to add castle 3. um and let's get another backdrop someone also mentioned having a dog who has to learn how to swim and so let me see if there's something that has a pool oh yes yes i remember i knew there had to be a pool background uh so we've got these two backgrounds um and you can you can click on the stage and go to backdrops to uh see the background drops you have you have we have castle three and we have pool and we can we have this blank one but i will delete that so um if let's go back to the scratch cat and go back to the code tab so uh let's say we want you can switch between backdrops with this uh switch you know what make this a tiny bit smaller you can switch between backdrops with this switch backdrop block so you can click right now it says switch backdrop to pool and switch to pool uh and i can actually also let me drag out another one because i can drag this out again and in this one pick castle 3 and then i can this with this i can switch to castle three so this is an extremely useful block for controlling what the backdrop or what the scene of your of your uh story is so you can switch between them like this now let's say let me make this a little smaller again let's say that at the beginning of the project we want uh we'll say the beginning of the project we want the scratch cat to be at the castle and then and we want it to show up with this show block but then once it gets to the pool we want it to hide like let's say the scratch cat is not in the scene at the pool so when the green flag is clicked you can do switch backdrop oh we wanted it to start at the castle so when the green flag is clicked we'll have it start at the castle we'll switch the backdrop to that and then uh we'll and when the green flag is clicked uh you know how's the best way to do this uh maybe when the backdrop switches to the castle we'll have the scratch catch shut so uh it starts the backdrop switches to the castle and because the backdrop switched to the castle the scratch cat shows up and this this block that i just dragged out when backdrop switches to um can also be used to make it hide when we go to another scene so when the backdrop switches to pool we want the scratch cat to hide drag that out and so let's uh say uh so yeah let's just test it out i'm gonna click this and this will switch the backdrop to the pool so we switch to the pool and the scratch cat hides um but then if we if we restart the project and switch because that switches the backdrop to castle 3 then the cat shows because when the backdrop switches to castle 3 it shows up um and then uh let's let's let's just test it all out by having when the project starts it'll wait one second at the castle and then switch the backdrop to the pool so it's gonna should start at the castle wait and then switch the pool and it should it has these instructions that say when it goes to the castle show up and when it switches to the pool hide so let's test it out it starts it's at the castle and it goes to the pool so i hope that helped as a way to make uh the make a character show and hide and how you could use that just to do different scenes um oh okay someone else asks um how to add sound when they talk uh so uh that's a great question uh let me go back to one of the ones where i had a character uh be talking uh so there's this uh bat uh that uh uh um when the space key pressed if you remember in this project when the space key pressed uh this bat says uh how was your day scratch cat so if i press the space key says how's your day scratch cat let's uh show how you would add sound to this uh i'll show how first i'll just show so there's this block start sound which is really great it will start a sound playing and then uh that sound will be playing as the character keeps doing the other stuff you wanted it to do so uh i could drag this start sound block uh when so when the space key is pressed the bat will uh start the sound and then say how's your day scratch cat so i'll press the space key oh wait do i have my volume on okay i'm not sure if you can hear that because it's making this little quiet owl sound but i hope you heard that uh it makes this sort of whoosh owl sound uh because we didn't have a bat sound and we decided owl was the closest thing um so uh the um what i was gonna show you is uh that's one way of um of making a sound play but also you could record yourself saying what you want the character to say and uh and have that play so to do that uh i went through that quickly let me show you more slowly uh click on the sounds tab and then you can go down to this button down here choose a sound and you can go up to here record and uh click record oh i'm gonna allow it to use my microphone and now you can record something so uh how was your day scratch cat how was your day scratch cat okay hope you can hear that so and it seems pretty good save that now saved is recording one and now to make that sound play you just go back to the code tab and uh from this start sound block right now it's selecting owl but you can go down to recording one and now i'm going to press the space key how was your day scratch cat yeah there you go so you could have it be actually saying aloud uh what you wrote for it to say um so yeah that's how you could add um sound to what the characters say um great question uh oh uh someone says uh uh hello hope you are having a great day thank you i am this is seriously the highlight of my week uh i hope you're having a great day too and then they say uh how do you get different sprites uh so it's great question um i'll go back to this scratch this project with the actually you know what i'll just open up a new project so i'm going to scratch.mit.edu slash create i'm just going to say this link every time in case you're joining now uh you go to scratch.mit.edu create uh you can open up a scratch project and start making one and also if you're joining now in the stream but welcome uh so the question was how to add different characters to your project so one way which i i showed in the stream but in case you missed it i'm gonna show it again uh you hover over this button that says choose a sprite and if you click there's a lot of options one is you can say click choose and then you can choose from all these well they all look blank right now okay all these default sprites that we have uh that could just be a a way to just get a character into your project uh so we've got uh you know all these different categories we got animals we got people uh you got fantasy characters uh dance characters uh you know music musical instruments sports all this stuff so that so that's a great way you can add add a character like that and you can add as many as you want you know yeah i'd say i picked the batter uh let's also get um uh um you know the the uh you know come on mom looks cool so you know you can add in you know as many characters as you want that's one way um another way is that you can upload um a picture from your computer so uh yeah you could upload uh if you just click on here upload sprite i don't really have a picture at hand but you can uh you can just bring any picture that you have into the scratch project like that you could take a screenshot of something on the internet and then upload it uh so yeah that's that that'll you know bring a character in like that um yeah so that's that's those are some ways of getting uh different sprites um oh man so many good questions okay um so uh uh oh and you know what i just want to mention we had another uh story prompt idea that came in um in espanol a bat that doesn't know how to fly i love that idea also and we do have a murcielago or bat sprite so you could use that gracias for uh uh questions in spanish are very welcome thank you for the question in spanish um so uh the um uh we oh so okay oh oh my gosh all these great questions okay i'm gonna try to answer them all because they're all really good um the i just love reading all your questions uh so someone asks um uh someone asks how do you animate a sprite and someone also asks how do you get sprites to change costume i think i can uh answer these in one uh in one answer so yes to animate a sprite um the you you could use this uh chain these next costume blocks because in scratch the costumes of a character up here that you can see up here are sort of considered to be different poses for the character pretty often that's usually how we think about it is so this batter has all these different poses and uh some sprites like i'm on i wasn't actually intending this but this is kind of a good example amman only comes with one costume um but i could show you how you could make multiple costumes if you wanted to but first i'll show you on the batter who does come with multiple costumes so a way to animate a sprite is and a way to use the to change costumes and let me make the size bigger is you can use this next costume block to switch between costumes um you can also switch to a specific costume so let me go and see what batter d is okay batter d is this one um and and then you've got like uh batter c is this one so i can switch costume to batter d and then pick out the other specific one i wanted batter c because that kind of looked like like she was hitting ball uh so i can do today uh yes um so anyway uh i thought i just i thought my microphone got unplugged but it did not um so you can switch to uh batter d and then wait one second and then they attach these together and then switch to batter c so she's sort of ready to swing and then swings and you could have that right now i'm just clicking on this to make it happen but you could have that happen uh when the green flag is clicked uh you know so i could just click the green flag to start that um or you could have that happen when the space key is pressed or something like that you can also animate a character so like this character amman who only had one costume you know you can uh you could duplicate that costume and then you could go in and uh you know change something okay i don't want to like uh photoshop this really badly or not photoshop but you know scratch photoshop but here so i could what you could do is you can with this uh selection tool right here you could select a part of the person and then you could drag that around and repose it so you know what i'm gonna count that it's not such a terrible of a scratch photoshop job just don't look at it too closely um so now you know you've got these different costumes as a mod kind of looks like he's flying uh and now you could use the the next costume block to switch between those so do fly and pay no attention to the pixelation um anyway so thanks for questions about animating a character um let's see uh more questions oh um okay uh uh someone asks uh can you import your own design yes totally i think that is wonderful that's one of those i love this about scratch um you can you can either draw your own design by uh hovering over this choose a sprite button and clicking paint uh and then you can draw anything you want you know you could use this paint brush to draw a face that could be your design or maybe your design is different than my design that i just made um and you can you can also uh hover over this choose a sprite button and click upload to upload any design that you have on your computer um so yes you can um uh uh someone asks um uh uh how to use a text to speech block this is a great question i loved seeing uh in last week's studio so many people did projects with text to speech it's so fun for introducing characters and telling stories so let me show you so text to speech uh they're not in any of these categories here they are some other blocks that you can add to scratch by just clicking on this button down here so just click on that and uh just click on uh right here text to speech these are extensions to scratch which just add more blocks that you can use um so uh click on text to speech and then we have these new blocks that you can use to make characters talk so uh you can uh drag out uh one of these uh and click on it hello so the character uh actually speaks a loud and says hello i think the one that's speaking right now is this face uh i'll i'll make uh the i'll make the scratch cat speak it can say that um the you can also control the voice you can have it say different voice you can also add lots of uh speak blocks one after another and just write whatever you want to say um i am the scratch cat hello i am the scratch cat yeah or you could add this squeak voice hello i am the scratch cat and uh and the other thing one other thing i'll show you about texttospeech blocks is um that you can also uh you can add a say block along with it so uh there's this say block that uh says say hello for two seconds and that's uh really useful for uh making it say hello for that period of time but you could also have this there's this block say hello and you might wonder why why are there these two different blocks it's because this one you can uh drag it out and then it will say this thing in this say block until another block comes up to have it say something else so uh i can drag another one of these say blocks here and put it in there and then write i am the scratch cat here because this this these green speak blocks are going to be controlling what the cat is saying out loud but then these say blocks are controlling what it will say in the speech bubble so let me show you how that will go hello i am the scratch cat that went a little fast with the ulta with the squeak voice let me change it to alto um so i am the scratch cat it says hello uh in this box while it's um you know it says hello in the speech bubble and then once it finishes speaking hello it says the next thing so that uh can be a really nice way of using texttospeech and also having speech bubbles along with it um so thanks for the question uh let's see uh someone asks uh you do um how to make the characters move and then talk to other characters it's a great question maybe uh we can show it with a mom um so uh to make a character move uh you'd want to go to this motion category and now there's tons and tons of ways that you could make a character move uh you could have it uh you know uh like so let's let's say we want this to happen when the green flag is clicked it will drag out when green flag clicked um you could have it uh okay so we want to go to this motion category it could be that when the green flag clicked you want it to just move ten steps and move ten steps will just make it move kind of forward in whatever direction it's pointing and right now it's the amount is pointing this way um and so you could move 10 step when the green flag is clicked amon will then move 10 steps oh yeah and the batter is doing this little animation um so uh so that's one way of making a character move um you could also um have let's let's have a mon start over here you can have a character start at one point and then glide to another so let's say start over here uh and and if you drag it to a position you can use this go to block to make it just go to that position so this so this go to block when i'll make him go here so if i drag over here and click that again go back here uh and then you could use a glide block to make him go like here so and because i dragged it out here this glide block will now cause them to glide there so i drag these out this one is so let let me just drag them somewhere random this glide block makes him glide to right there so uh you can attach these together and so then he's the uh elan starts over here where i drag him first and then glides over here so that is one way of care making characters move with these using these goto and glide blocks um and then uh and then to make a character say something there's these you know these say blocks so then uh amman could say hi batter scratch cat and smiley face um so let me move the scratch cat perhaps a little bit out of the way this story is truly truly wonderful um uh so uh so when the green flag is clicked uh amman will like go over here and then uh and then glide over there and talk to the other characters so that's a way you could uh talk have a character move and then talk to other characters so uh oh my gosh there are still so many great questions uh now we only have 10 minutes left so uh in a few moments i am going to start wrapping up and i will show uh how you could make an account in case you don't have an account and i will also show um how you can share your project if you want to uh but you know maybe i have time for one more quick question um uh someone asks um one last quick question someone asks um how can you use multiple backdrops for a story um you can go by hovering over this choose a backdrop button and then clicking choose and then you can uh choose any of these backdrops that you want so there's this colorful city one that i like a lot um and and you can add another one you can add uh let's see there's this nice uh beach um and then you can click uh you can there's this handy block next backdrop that you can drag out to go between them and i see that blank backdrop that i started with there so i can you can get rid of that you can go to the stage click on backdrops and then just hit delete on that uh so anyway so and now and now if you click back on uh amman
