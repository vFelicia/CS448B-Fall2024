hi everyone welcome to another scratch video update I Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on Scratch and I am Eric also known as speak visually on scratch welcome to episode number 13 lucky episode number 13 and happy New Year happy New Year it's been a while since the last update I think it's been we're overdue by a couple weeks so sorry about that but you have been busy since then yes um actually before I jump in where are we we're in the MIT media lab oo this is where we walk in every day there there's also Lego model the media lab super beautiful yes so we've been busy and uh for me I've been traveling to different parts of the world one of which was Tokyo and at Tokyo Japan and while I was there I met scratchers scratch teachers researchers developers all working on Scratch and I got to see some pretty cool projects and meet some new people and we also worked on projects together I'm super jealous I actually went home I was back in Ohio I was not in Tokyo uh and I got a quadcopter and I have no idea how to fly it so if anyone has advice on how to fly the things let me know please but with that let's get to it our first segment love it love it so the love it section is projects that Rick Rose and I found in the community that we love though we love all projects equally um so one project I want to talk about was uh it's project by pixel and it's called when I photobomb people and if you're not familiar with photob bombing it's just when someone like walks in the back of your shot and the person like doesn't know that it's happening and I guess it happens quite often um but anyway so they made a project where a skier comes by and photob bombs their picture it's hilarious but then even cooler is there's like over 600 remixes of people having different people photo bomb them so I really enjoy that project so another project that I loved and a bunch of us also loved it too is this uh pillow fight made by Squig 3 Squig and you can join this project and it's multiplayer you can actually pillow fight with other people from anywhere in scratches using this project and you you you fight with pillows yes crazy it's using Cloud variables for like a real time multiplayer game I think it's one of my favorite Cloud variable projects I actually am res and I did a pel fight and I think he let me win anyways who really wins in a pillow fight everyone wins uh so so with that those are PR we love but we have our other segment you're holding it this time try oops sorry I usually hold it to try mixing it up it's 201 so the things to try are just cool things that are happening in the community I always mention the scratch Design Studios I always cuz there's always a new cool one and this in this case uh we have the uh Happy new year 2016 uh scratch

who helped us design this feature cool hey everyone I am joined with Rachel our special guest to talk about a cool new feature that we have on scratch so Rachel tell us a bit about yourself uh my name is Rachel I'm an MIT student and uh I'm a scratcher I've been scratching for years um and now I'm working with the scratch team in studying computer science cool so tell us about this feature how long you've been working on it what does it do so uh the feature is a feature that you record your project as a video file um I started working on it this summer I worked on it all summer so that was you know 3 months and then since then working on a few little tweaks yeah uh so it's many months in the works and I so happy to now be with Rachel to show us how it works so I'm going to try to do something let's go over to the computer and then you'll show us a bit about how it works okay let's see I have the computer go ahead and show us all right so it's up in the file menu record project video okay uh there's a few different options you can include sound from the microphone if you want to talk about your project while you're recording you can show the mouse pointer in the video um and there's a couple other options like returning uh recording the entire editor if you're interested in you know making a tutorial or something nice well and this one will allow cool then we can see it's counting down now it's going to start recording and you can see you have how many seconds can you record for up to 60 seconds cool so we can then make 60c video now what format does the video come in and should they know about anything about that yeah so it comes in an FLV video format okay um so you may not have a program on your computer that can play that but there's several that you can
