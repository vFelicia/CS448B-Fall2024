Scratch is a online community where people around the world create and share interactive stories, games, and animations. Check out the homepage, where you can see projects created by others in the Scratch community! Click on a project to try it out. Click on the green flag to start the project. To see how this project was made, click “See Inside.” Use the Explore page to browse millions of projects! Make a new project by clicking “Create”! Each new project starts with a cat character, or what we call a “sprite”. You can drag out blocks to tell the cat what to do. Now, each time you click the cat, it changes color. Pull out another block to add sound. In the Tips Window, find out how you can make your own animations, stories, and games. Every Scratch project has its own page. You can name the project, type instructions, and share the project with others in the Scratch community. On any shared project, you can "Love it," "Favorite it" which bookmarks the project, leave a comment, or even remix the project! To remix, “See inside the project” and click the “Remix” button to start adding your own spin to it. Check out the “Tips” page for more ideas on creating Scratch projects. On the “My Stuff” page, you can see a list of all the different projects you’ve created. You can also go to your “Profile Page”, where other Scratchers can see what you’ve been doing in Scratch. What will you create?
