hello everybody good to see you hope this thing is on my name is Eric also known as speak busy on scratch so excited to have you all here for our create along hopefully this is working you might be wondering where is Zoey who is normally the host of the creative long sorry you're stuck with me today Zoey unfortunately lost her voice and is resting it so I'm gonna be walking me all through this next hour where we're going to be working on our own video sensing projects with scratch and so if you're completely new and have never been to a create along the idea is we're gonna for the next hour to work on the project I'll be here answering your questions and we're gonna hopefully there's a lot of tech in front of me right now this is my first time kind of doing this so there's computer here there's computer back there I actually have Zoey in the background and she's helping with the questions giving feedback how the texts working I got Jacy looking at the questions too so shout out to both of them behind the scenes so if you're new welcome and if you've already been here thanks for coming back and so I guess the idea is what we want to start with is just talking a bit about how the cradle longs are sort of a good opportunity for us now that we find ourselves sort of at home I think this is a great opportunity for us to sort of come together and to connect and to share and there's nothing better that I like to do on my downtime think rate with scratched and today I'm going to be showing you some amazing things you can do with video sensing and so to give a quick pitch video sensing is essentially controlling your scratch project without using your keyboard we'll talk more about this it sounds kind of fake but I trust me it's real and we'll do that so what we're going to do now is sort of talk about what the the hour is gonna look like and so I'm gonna pull up two super fancy graphic that we have that is the plan for today I hope that works also everything is mirrored so I have to point the opposite way at the point of things so we'll go ahead and walk through the schedule for today so today we're gonna gather so we've totally done that happy to see it there's 70 people all around the world that's super awesome and then we're going to look at last week's project so last week at our trade along Zoey taught us how to make virtual pets and so we'll check out all the amazing projects that were created then and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna kind of just share the prompt so to get people's I sort of mines going on what they want to do with video sensing and then we'll learn about scratch and create a project and then we'll answer questions live and so I didn't mention this earlier but there's a link right here where you can send in your questions and so please keep them coming in and I'll answer them to the best of my ability but I assure you we will make some mistakes along the way which is just a part of scratch so I can't promise that it can answer every single question so I've been talking kinda fast cuz I'm super excited so I'm gonna slow down a little bit and Wow while this is all happening I would suggest maybe having two windows open so maybe you have the YouTube video in one window and then scratch in another window so you can kind of be following along so if that all sounds good I'm gonna keep going and we'll take a chance to look at some of the past projects so I'm also gonna try to do a pro move here so I'm going to pull up the window and then I'm gonna switch to see if this works okay so hopefully what you can see is the studio with all of our virtual pets from last week and so I wanted to take a second just to cruise through all of these projects check out their thumbnails and so Zoe and a bunch of other folks created animal projects and so we see there's a cat icon creator we see rainbow exercise Cat nyan cat Tara pet hedgehog house dreamy I love this one the scratch Creed along that's an amazing name for a pet and so super excited to see this we'll have a chance today to when we're making our video sensing projects to share those as well to the studio you also might be wondering what this is in the corner of my screen I'm actually using my cat tree too as a laptop stand so if you see my cat jump up here that is because I'm currently using Gus's cat tree as a laptop stand anyways um so we can check out some of these projects I want to pull up one this is from Panda Girl it's about my dog super cute so let's go ahead and play it see if you can hear it so it looks like press space to make it say a word so my name is my dog's name is come you know he loves me and he's cute super cute I love that project so let's check out another one looks like we have the scratch create along love this name again this looks like we have hi my name is scratch dog and then I think what we can do is we can interact and we can drink some water eat some cheesy poof's quite amazing and then let's check out one more so my pet rock looks like this is a story so I think the idea is the pet rock is now gonna go play oh jesus there's a question so I want a small rock okay so now the rock is going to I guess play play ball looking good okay drag me to the ball this is a very complex project I'm pretty amazed by this this is so good okay and then I think there's actually I think if you play music okay well so you can play a little bit of music and then also like me getting very sleepy and going to bed pretty amazing so what a huge shout out to everyone that was creating projects again you'll have an opportunity at the end of this hour to be sharing your projects that you're making with video sensing so I'll share more about that soon so with all of that I think we want to take a chance to talk now about the prompt and so as I mentioned video sensing is the way in which you can not use your keyboard but rather your body to play with projects so what does that even mean because it's just kind of a weird concept and you might have done something like this with like an Xbox Kinect where again like you're dancing or you're you know pressing things on the screen using your hands so let's show what that looks like really quickly with scratch so I'm gonna try to again do my fancy seam switch here and pull up up Jax called eat the cheesy poof's with a windup toy so again I'm in scratch you can see me moving in the background and I'm gonna hit the green flag and we'll see what happens so we see there's some cheesy poof's here so let's see if I were to kind of eat them cool so maybe you've never done that with scratch it's one of my favorite things to do in scratch well eat cheesy poof's and video sensing so we'll get a chance to make our own project using this and that's it turns out that video sensing is quite quite simple and very very powerful so it's again one of my favorite things to do in scratch so let's go ahead and before we sort of dive in to making our project think a bit more about the theme so this is gonna be really important because we don't only want to sort of make a rant well I think making a random scratch project is pretty great but maybe it would be good to think about what kind of project you're interested in making so let me go ahead and exit out of this and find my cursor cool so with video sensing it enables you to make games you can make interactive Ted we could kind of do anything that you can sort of trigger with your hands or any movement or even an object so if you could think for a second about what it is you can do now that you have this superpower so to give you an idea I turned my fridge into a basketball hoop so I would throw a sock at the fridge and then I hit the basketball hoop and then also I turned my bathtub into a kayak and so these are some of the ideas that I had been thinking of and so it'd be good to think about what it is you want to create with video sensing so that said before we even start with video sensing maybe we should just get familiar with scratch and so what I'll do now is I'll pull up the scratch editor and so if you're not familiar with scratch what you're going to want to do is go to scratch.mit.edu so I will pull that up in my browser okay so now I have scratch up and this is the scratch online community you're saying here this is where millions of projects have been shared you can check them out here but I think my favorite part of the scratch community is this create button so if you hit create that pulls up what we call the scratch editor so the scratch editor is kind of where the magic happens this is where you're creating a project and this window right here I'm going to close this for now this is the tutorials window so this is where you have sort of resources to help you produce your project so this is the editor a few things that you want to know about the editor this is what we call this stage so you can kind of think of this one way I think of it on the right here the stage is it's kind of like a stage and a theater or maybe even like a movie theater screen this is kind of where your project will play okay so this is where the project is gonna be playing and then if we go with that metaphor kind of like the cast of characters are down here and we can control this character with coding blocks and the coding blocks are over here in the palette so again think of it sorry scratch cat on stage and then what do we want the scratch cat to do and so what we can do is we can pull out some of these blocks to control scratch cat so I'll go ahead and pull out the move ten steps and I'll zoom in so you can see it so we have scratch cat and I'm gonna hit move ten steps and we'll see what happens okay so the scratch guys kind of move in pretty cool pretty cool what if we had it moved and then maybe say something so we can have it place down meow so I'll connect those two and what's gonna do is gonna play in order it's gonna move ten steps and then play sound meow pretty cool now you notice what I'm doing is I can use my cursor to preview and play the blocks which is cool but if we're making a computer program we're gonna want to trigger it with something so we have these things called event blocks which again are triggers to start your script so we have plenty to choose from so we see here we have wind green flag clicked this a super common block the green flag is kind of like if you start a race it's what you start your project with so let's try that one okay pretty cool but maybe even cooler is this this block when key pressed so now instead of hitting the green flag when I hit this space key it will run my program so this is a super simple program it kind of shows you what it what what scratch is capable of it's an event block followed by sort of a line of sort of commands and code blocks and so that's like the very basic sort of functionality of the coding and so you might be wondering well this fat cat is cool but what about a background well we call these backdrops in scratch and if you want to add a background you just go to the bottom right here and then you click that to add choose a backdrop then say we want scratch cat hanging out like a basketball court I'll go ahead and choose that so now you're starting to sort of make your own story with this right and likewise you can choose other characters too so if I want scratch cat playing basketball with another character I can go ahead choose a sprite something like maybe hanging out with a bat so the bat and cat playing basketball the rhyme sounds nice and you can also add you can also add code to the bat so for instance you see there's no code in the bat but there's still the code that remains from the cat sprite so I'll go ahead and go with the bat when I hit the space key to say hello so now when I hit space key both characters are moving at once so that's super cool that's kind of like the quick intro to scratch please do some questions if that didn't make sense and I think that was kind of an important place for us to start because with video sentencing we're gonna keep it we're gonna keep it very simple and really rely heavily on these event blocks and so without further ado let's go ahead and talk about video sensing so when you're in the editor I'm gonna go ahead and make a new project so if you're in the editor I want us all to quickly pull up the tutorial for video sensing so if you look in the top top left you'll see a tutorials button okay and that's gonna load an array of amazing tutorials I would totally recommend checking out some of these but today we're gonna look at video sensing so we'll scroll down and we'll see video sensing here so I'm gonna go ahead and click that okay so if you've never used a tutorial in scratch this is kind of the general sort of layout is it's gonna start with a video that gives you inspiration let's go ahead and check that video out really quick you can see here we have Zoe who is joining us via the video who is playing a musical instrument we had champ eeka who was petting the cat and then we also had sort of saving these minifigs as they were falling and so you can kind of get a glimpse of what is possible with video sensing and if you were to click the green arrow you'll then see the different steps that show you how it is you can make a video sensing project now fortunately you all have me today so I can help sort of guide you through this tutorial and we don't have to look at the steps but I would highly encourage folks to check out the de toros if you want so I got some feedback here that I should hide the bitly and add the extension yeah that's a really good that's a really good point so the first step that we want to do is to add the extension and so video sensing is what we call an extension and if you're not familiar with extensions extensions can be software so they could live on your computer or if they can be hardware so they can be a robot or some kind of device that you plug into your computer and so this video sensing is going to be a software extensions because it's using our webcam so I'm gonna go ahead and make sure you can see the extensions button so I'm gonna try to grab my cursor don't know where it is there it is Oh oh okay this is the most difficult part of this is finding it so no no you know okay you know what we're gonna we're gonna wing this right now I'm going to try something oh there we go okay so to add the extension step number one to a video sensing project check this out with me so the extensions live in the bottom left of the screen so we're gonna go ahead and click the bottom left this button here and we'll see all the different extensions so you can see we have Hardware extensions and software extensions so let's go ahead and click video sensing okay so we have just turned on video sensing and we noticed a couple of things happened two things one we now see ourselves in the stage which is looking good and two we see a number of new blocks to choose from so let's go ahead and quickly talk about the different blocks sort of introduce ourselves get familiar with the blocks so we can see here video sensing this is a hat block so when video motion exceeds ten this is one of my favorite blocks in scratch and we'll spend some time digging into this block in a second but I also want to show the set video transparency so this is an important block because as you can see you can see myself in in this stage but you notice it's kind of there's a little white haze that's going over my face right now and that's because the transparency of the video on the stage is at fifty percent and so if you don't feel like transparency is like how seethrough something is so I would like you all to see me better so I would like it to be less transparent so if we were to say let's make it twenty you can now see me a bit better so maybe I'll go to ten I like even better and maybe zero so now you can see me there is zero percent transparency I'm coming really clear it's just kind of like a webcam it's looking good I want to show you what 100 looks like okay so 100 you can't see anything right so let's go back to zero looking good all right so there's a couple other there's a couple other blocks here too that I want to check out one is turning the video on so video sensing it's going to turn the video on automatically and if that's not the case make sure that you give permissions in your browser you might have seen when you try to turn on video sensing something that appeared on your computer that said you do allow or disallow access your webcam you want to make sure that you say allow and if you do that it should automatically appear if for some reason during your project you want to turn off the video you could use this this block to turn off the video so I'm going to leave it on and then I thinkwell will pause and not sort of dig into this next box here this is a variable that's gonna store some of the values of video motion but we'll talk about that a bit later so let's dive in to the magic of video sensing and we're gonna hang out for maybe 10 15 minutes just using one one of these blocks and that is I think the most powerful Block in scratch and I'm super excited to share this with you and this I see a question is what's the straightforward definition of video sensing in scratch I hopefully it is hard to define so I'm hoping this can sort of help you understand what video sensing is so this block is saying when video motion exceeds ten so one thing to think about is video motion is the amount of motion that's gonna happen on the screen and it's specifically looking for video motion underneath the sprite so this is our sprite here and it's on a scale of 0 to 100 and so 0 would be no movement behind the sprite and 100 would be as much movement as we could possibly do so using that simple concept when video motion exceeds 10 which is just a light movement something can happen so I'll go ahead and try that so how about we I don't know make the cat meow when we touch it so go ahead grab a play sound meow until done okay so if all goes according to plan when we move oh sorry when we move our hand over the cat with some amount of motion a little bit amount of motion hopefully the Hat block will start the meow sound so let's go ahead and try this okay so this is like a noose it keeps me super powered because this is like a superpower so now you are controlling with your body actions that happen on the computer and you notice it sometimes it'll trigger even though I'm not doing anything and that's because it's somehow is seeing some type of movement on the wall it might be a shadow it might be a change of the light so what you might want to do is change the value to 30 so it's less sensitive let's try it just for the heck of it to make it 80 and see if it even works okay so if Easy's like a lot I'm getting an arm workout that's good but that's probably too high so one thing to know is tweak this value see what seems natural to you so I would say 20 in this condition 20 seems like natural enough I'm not over doing it and it is yeah so I think 20 feels good so like I said it's a one tip that I have above all else with video sensing is think about the code can be simple think about what it is you're trying to make so for instance with just this 2 block stack we have an awesome thing where the cat meows when we when we pet it so maybe we can say maybe we can try something else like I don't know maybe maybe we have the cat change color so one of my favorite blocks that we have in scratch is the change color effect block so it's in looks and then change color effect so now what's going to happen is when we pet the cat it will play the sound meow and then change the color of that okay cool so here's one thing with scratches I think I would like it when I pet it to change color and then yow so you'll notice the block sacs are kind of running in order so what I'm gonna do is I want to move up the block stack so now when I pet it it'll change color and then meow pretty cool all right let's try one other thing so it's kind of cool that the cat is change of color and meowing but let's have it move when we pet the cat so if we go to the motion blocks up top motion blocks are super see it is triggering a nothing motion blocks super powerful and I use them in almost every single project one of my favorite of the motion blocks is the slide to random position so the glide to random position is gonna do exactly what it says it's gonna take your character and have a glide to somewhere else on the screen so let's go ahead and do that so I will pull that in I think I want it to change color glide invent me I'll so let's see if it works okay cool very nice so you can see with with with just three blocks seriously just three blocks we've already created this like pretty cool program with video sensing I see there's a question of can we add more extensions with the video sensing you absolutely can so let's do that really quickly okay let's try let's try the voice extension this texttospeech extension so I will find my mouse cursor which is always missing okay and then I'm gonna add another extension which is texttospeech texttospeech is another it's like pretty simple to explain texttospeech let me actually get rid of I see you can see my video twice let's get rid of that no need to see me twice so texttospeech awesome extension super easy to explain to you just grab the blocker to speak and then you say what it is you want to speak so instead of them yell maybe I'll do maybe I'll do this meow meow meow okay the now doesn't sound totally like a cat so I'll maybe you can set the voice to to Alto which is I think a bit higher or squeaked let's try that as you can see meow super chill having fun okay cool so I promised you that it doesn't take a lot of blocks so oh here's one here's one here's an interesting that's happening normally when you make a scratch project you can hit the stop sign and the stop sign kind of shuts everything down which is good because sometimes have a project is going really crazy I should stop doing that project oh I'm really crazy you hit the stop sign and everything's pauses and stops with video sensing this half block is always gonna trigger no matter what I can hit the stop sign so I'm blue in the face but it's gonna keep going and that's because this hat block overrides the green flag so if ever like oh my gosh just too much going on what you do is disconnect disconnect your scripts from the hat block nothing's gonna happen it doesn't know what to do this event block has nothing hanging out underneath so you'll be good I run into that it's one of the biggest issues video sensing is what be in the background like they get a bunch of noise so yeah that is a pro tip right there so can you make an animation with video sensing that is a good question thanks for asking it and let's let's go ahead and do one now so I wanted to show you this anyways so let's go ahead win make a new project don't worry it's easy enough with video sensing to make something new really quickly so again you see me I'm ghosted I kind of don't like that ghosted book so I'm gonna make sure that I'm setting my transparency to zero now you see me better so let's make an animation let's make a drum let's make a drum that we can hit let's make an instrument yeah so a scratch cat I'm gonna have to say goodbye to you so I'm gonna go ahead and remove scratch cat so scratch that's gone I have no sprites let's go ahead and pick a drum sprite so go ahead I just hope so I did that really quickly again I'm gonna add a new sprite going down here click add I am going to click the drum looks like the drum I'm going to search for a drum and notice that we have so many drums to choose from but it's kind of wild let's try as let's try the drum kit okay so we're gonna keep it this might look pretty similar to the cat animation that we did so I want I want us to think about animation so animation can mean a lot of things it can mean it can mean growing and shrinking it can mean tilting it could mean changing costumes and so I want to show you both so when video motion exceeds 10 our super power block the best Block in scratch wind video motion exceeds 10 let's have it grow and shrink let's have bad animations over okay so let's go to the looks category looks category purple category it's gonna have your size in there it's gonna have like that color effect block that we had earlier so let's go ahead and look at the set size block so set size to 100 this is currently 100 if we set size to say 200 let's see what looks like boom okay cool so how about wind video motion exceeds 10 let's set the size to 100 now let's set it to 200 okay so when we hit that it's gonna go 200 and then let's have a wait one second and then shrink back down so 200 wait one second let's have a wait point five seconds and then let's have it go back down so again that's good oh now are you triggered okay cool it's like I feel like it needs a sound and so it's cool about the the drum sprites any any instruments right is they have some sounds builtin so if we go to the sounds category here we can drag out play lowtom which i think is the sound so it may be 0.5 Seulong I think playing fives too long probably my thighs a little too long so maybe we do like point two okay I can't use I actually hit Siri on my laptop okay cool and then one other things I said so maybe to use okay a little sensitive so let me disconnect the block I also mentioned so you can change the size that is certainly one way to animate it but I also want to show you this concept of costumes so if you're not familiar we see our character our sprite here there's this magical tab called costumes where in the drum set in this case has another sort of costume another look to it so you see it says drum kit and drum kit B and so these are the two costumes it has and so you can see as I toggle between these costumes this is changing yeah so what if we could do this with like code and I don't have to continue to click this that would be nice well there is a way in scratch so what we'll do is we'll go to looks there is the next costume block so that will switch automatic to the next costume so but let's let's think we're to add this into our script so so we expand to 200% we're playing the sound let's change the costume okay expand sound costume change weight set size okay cool I mean I don't know simple animation using wow there's so many questions out sorry there's so many questions so that you get to but hopefully that helps you put understand how it is you can I really gotta undo these blots how it is you can animate drums in scratch can you use color sensing with video sensing yes you absolutely can I will get to that a bit later cuz that's a bit more complex can you make a platformer with video sensing you know what I'm glad you asked you can you can make even like one better than a platformer so here's it here let me show you this is gonna sound kind of silly but imagine you could actually play Mario which sounds weird but one thing to know about video sensing is what if you what if you stood way back from the camera what if your way back here and you were running and you were grabbing things as they came and so I could probably quickly show you what that might look like but let me let me suggest to you that that is totally possible that would probably take about 15 minutes to show you but let me show you a somewhat similar idea that might get you inspired by this and so let me create a game that kind of exists in that sort of platformer space and so that is a game that we're gonna play where were the character and we're really small and we're gonna be running from something so I'm going to I'm gonna create a bug I'm gonna create a bug so no I'll go with our friend in the back so what if instead of a platformer we did something where the bat is flying around trying to touch us which I don't know yeah not a bad thing maybe it's a good thing maybe we want to get touched by that back so anyways I will set the size because if that's a little little big a little small now well that's too big so I'm gonna set the size of the bat to 50 I think okay so we have a bat flying around so what if the game was we have to avoid the bat yeah not quite a platformer but again it's like I'm using my body I'm like running so simple let's have the bat flyer on the screen I can do this with three blocks when greenside clicked I told you my spike one of my favorite motion blocks glide to random position so let's click that so we see okay that's cool when we hit the green flag it's gonna glide but we want that to continue to happen so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap that in forever forever loop so the bat is always moving okay so you can see I'm kind of trying to avoid it okay cool but but it's not interactive right like I could do that it's kind of fun it's kind of cool but like what if what if we made it a game where I like if it touches me it says something or makes a sound so we can do that with video sensing and we'll do it with the same kind of sort of setup that we had earlier so wind video sensing exceeds ten so when the bat is kind of hitting me because I'm in the way it'll it'll do something so maybe we'll have it play a sound the stand let's do a laugh yeah so I'm gonna add a sound so I'm doing that really quick so the bat it's right has the owl sound but the owl sound isn't kind of like what I'm going for so I'm going to change the sound by going down here sorry the url's blocking this but there's just a little speaker icon to choose a sound and then I'll choose something weird I don't know if the basketball sound why not so with so when when the bat touches me it's going to play the basketball sound okay so the game is to avoid the bat okay so now it's triggering like crazy so I'm going to change the sensitivity to 30 because it's triggering on something that I don't know what what it's triggering on and again that's that idea of 10 might not be the best so let's go ahead okay figure down a watt now so let me try to go 60 okay so it's not perfect I told you I was gonna make mistakes so what's happening is the bat is triggering on some type of motion that it's seeing on the background and not just me so that is to say the biggest sensing is not perfect but the kind of concept of what we're doing here what the logic does works let me try 90 and see if we can't get it to work and then if it doesn't I'm gonna stop this demo yeah it is so interesting that is triggering on the background so video sensing isn't perfect and we should be guys just as you're creating build around knowing that it's not gonna be perfect cool so how do you get your own sounds is a good question thanks for asking so say we didn't want the basketball sound what we can do is we can go to the sounds tab of the of the sprite and record our own sounds so there's a couple ways to do this I mean get rid of let me get rid of the thing on the bottom get rid of bitly okay so the question is how can you get your own sounds there's a number different ways so one way you can do it is you can record your own sound so if you go down to the bottom left here you can hit record give permission to use their microphone then go boom and then you can save your sound you can name it so that's one way to do it there's another way in which you can upload from your computer so if you have a sound that you saved on your computer already you can go ahead and upload it this way and then you can also choose from the library of sounds the libraries like super awesome there's so different sounds in their toy check that out I'm kind of bummed that our little back game didn't work let me try it one more time at 95 to shoot the 95 sensitivity is gonna is gonna do it for us now it's just so sensitive on that wall anyways so I'm gonna play with so how do you get your own sound we did that one would have let me pull up some of these questions thank you so much for all these amazing questions I'm just gonna try to again find my mouse cursor because it's always disappearing on me what if you don't know where the blocks are because my first time using scratch oh that's a good question so I think the question is what it what if is your first time using scratching don't know where the blocks are I would suggest if it's your first time using scratch maybe what I would do is I would check out in the tutorials window I would check out the getting started with scratch activity or the imagine a world activity so I just clicked imagine the world this particular tutorial introduces you to a lot of the introductory blocks in scratch or some of the more basic blocks in scratch and it's gonna give you sort of a nice understanding of what is available and so it's gonna introduce you to looks blocks to sound blocks to event blocks things like that and to be honest it might seem like there's a lot of blocks in scratch but I kind of typically hang out with just like maybe like 15 to 20 of them I tend to use the motion blocks a lot I'm always making my characters move and turn I'm using the glide block as I mentioned I think the looks block again thus a block is super powerful some of these more introductory blocks and I say introductory but I just mean that they're there I don't know pretty straightforward and they are incredibly powerful and then I also think that the play sound and play sound until done blocks are super super powerful and I use them quite a lot so I would say it's doing those two things okay how do you make a pong game using video sensing that is a good question so just like any sort of any and any game in scratch can be converted to a video sensing game so if you were to create a a pong game I guess you could say when when I touch we can play pong with the bat so when I sort of touch the bat have it glide across the screen so let's try to make that script really quick so when video motion exceeds ten let's have it move ten steps so let's see what happens okay cool so not quite there let's try it again okay so not quite palm so what we can do is instead of having it move just ten steps we can have it move ten steps in a loop so that will make it move even more so let's go ahead and put that in a loop so ten times so now I'll take it off from the biggest sensing when I click that it will move so let's do that yeah okay so we see it's moving now ten steps ten times so it's 100 pixels across the screen let's try something more like 30 so you can see now it's moving quite fast across the screen so we can attach that now to our stack okay pretty cool I'm trying to think how it is we would do this in a way where it's like pong where it bounces back and forth you know I wish I had a cohost cuz I I have a feeling Zoey would know how to do this that's a really good question I'm trying to think what I would suggest doing is checking out in the scratch community I'll pull this up right now it's okay not to have the answers I'm sorry I do think a pong game might take it take some time so I'm gonna model when I have an idea that I don't quite know how to solve now what I do is for pong game and what I'll do is I'll pull up a pong game for instance starter pong and what I'll do is I'll play the project and go like okay cool I see how this works okay pretty cool so what I'll do is I'll bet and say like okay let's see inside let's see what the code looks like so the code it looks like the paddle has its own sprite and we're setting the paddle to Mouse X and so then what I would do is I would probably add the video sensing extension so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then I would start to manipulate this project to say okay Winn have bit of sensing on trying to hit the ball and see what happened so it looks like there is something here the code says when the ball is touching the paddle go in the random position start sound I don't know why today I'm sorry I can't I can't no I don't it's not kind of there's a way you should do it you know what here's you should do it and then share it in the studio and then next week next week when I do is well Zoey will do cos Zoey we closed ting we're gonna show that project we're gonna show a video sensing pong sorry so that that is my non answer answer which is check out other projects in the community and get the gear spinning on what it is you might do what is the difference between play sound thanks to the question by the way what is the difference between play sound and play sound until done that is a good question that haunts everyone as they get used to scratch so there's a very important difference between place on place sound done so let's pull out both of those blocks really quick so play sound play sound until done so let's go let's let's model this so if we were to play the sound you know what I want to get a longer sound for this I want to model it with a longer sound and I'm also gonna pull up the URL so you all could ask more questions sorry friends jeez Louise okay so I want to model this with a with a much longer sound so you can kind of get the understanding of what's going on here we go okay so I will pull up I'm gonna choose what I know is the long sound so and the bat sprite I'm gonna go to sounds I'm gonna pull up a sound from the library that is the loop okay so that is an eightsecond song it's very chill so the play sound until done is going to play that sound until it is done it's gonna play the entire eight seconds of that really chill awesome majestic sound so it's gonna that's gonna play all eight seconds so if I were to put that into a loop what happens playing as playing and playing for six seconds in were seven seconds in so okay now we've read every started so it's gonna play the eight seconds in loop forever good for the background of your project do that let's try something else let's try it now the play sound block just a place on block sound so what what it's trying to do is it's like hitting the play button like 100 times a second and so it's not gonna play all 80 seconds it's gonna just try to keep starting to sound start time so that's um so you only get like the first millisecond of the sound so never put start sounds into a forever loop that's the number one thing well yeah if you're gonna get this you're gonna get this so but so that that's that's kind of like the one reason but I also want to share something that is important and I shouldn't say you should never use them in a forever loop I'm going to show you why say you want your cat to like you to be like moving as it's like playing the chill music so we'll bring up our back here so we have our bat here and if we want to have the bat the gliding around the screen as the music is playing we'll want to do start sound and I'll show you why so start sound chill and then we'll have the bat move so again this script is gonna say start the sound chill play that eight seconds and while that's happening why so we see the sound started playing now the difference is if you if you wanted to that effect but use place on until done you have to wait eight seconds waiting waiting reading and then it moves so if you want the music to play underneath start the sound and then other things could happen in the script yeah so that's that's the difference between play sound plays on until then I gotta tell you the amount of times that I've done this is wild so don't feel bad if you've done that I do it all the time you're awesome thank you I've slowed down how quickly I'm talking when I started I was really excited I'm still really excited but I was talking too quickly so sorry about that anyways I wanted to show you one of the cool thing with video sensing that involves the play sound and I think play sounds chill is the perfect example of what it is you can do with this so remember we just created some really cool background music so we're like chillin it's cool so what if we made a dance party and the idea is if you are moving the song would play and if you're not moving this one doesn't play so let's try that so again we have our background spray it sounds cool it's chill okay so how do we do this I want to show you a block that we haven't talked about yet messing the video sensing blocks so I'm going back to video sensing and it's this block right here so let's take 10 to 15 seconds to talk about this block this is a variable so this is gonna have stored values in it stored values yeah from 0 to 100 and the values can change so in this case it's the motion on the sprite so let's see quickly with what that looks like there's values in it if we click the value we can see the value pop up really quickly so 9 0 2 4 that's the amount of motion that's happening underneath the sprite you can also detect the amount of motion on this stage so the entire stage happening here so as I move around the stage we can see it's like 80 90 okay so what if we did this what if we said set the volume set the volume of the sound to the amount of movement so if there's a lot of movement on the stage 100 it's gonna be a hundred volume it's gonna be really loud and if there's no movement we're not gonna hear anything okay so using this block let's let's try that so so when I hit the green flag when I hit the green flag for ever be doing this and what we wanted to be doing for ever we wanted to be setting the volume so there is a set volume block here set volume so forever he's setting the volume to the amount of motion on the stage before we do this I also want to create a really really simple script that's going to show us the value of the variable so I also want it to forever be showing us the value of the variable and the way in which you show the value of the variable is to put it in a safe lock so when I hit the green flag forever forever say the value so grab a save lock forever say this value and this value again is gonna be hanging out between 0 and 100 so I'll grab that and again it's forever say the amount of motion on the backdrop so let's see if it works so again sorry that was a lot of things so and this is what I like to do when I'm when I'm scratching and I and I've just done a couple things I like to just digest and say what did I just do so we have and you can even you can even comment the code I'll add a comment this is for background music okay that's our background music that's for ever play the sound chill this is I'm gonna add a comment this is letting us know a little say box neck up here here on the thing on this right it's gonna say the value so that's gonna be value and then this is our set volume script which is setting the volume to the amount of emotion on stage let's try it out okay I don't know if it's coming through on the speakers that well but it does work so if I if I have like no movement on the screen no one's here it's you know it's weird it's cool I would suggest trying that you can make your own little dance party get weird with it so yeah the amount of motion on the stage linked in with another block is super super fun so anyways that was a long way to answer that question what occasions are good for video sensing I would say I would say but with video sensing you can make stories you can make games you can make animations I really do think anything that you feel like can be triggered so if you're thinking about collecting coins shooting a basketball interacting with an object those are all really great things for video tempting but I do think what I chose like 10 minutes ago were used to going this fast community look at their product and say like hey like how can i how can I use video sensing now I even show you there's also something like super simple for kid even about let's just do the simplest code let's just do this simplest code to make like a filter like a snapchat filter so I'll choose a new sprite nom to do the Hat so here we see the Hat okay pretty cool maybe make it a little bit bigger make it 200 so like even just like that there's no code here and it's super cool but maybe we can actually we can do something even cooler maybe when we hit the space key we can change the costume so we notice there's four different hats here so we can make super simple script win space key switch to the next costume yeah just just play with I mean there's just there's just too much here there's just it's good for everything that's another not answer I'm sorry I do I do want to be mindful of time thank you all so much for your questions looks like we have now about eight minutes and so I want to make sure that we have a chance to show you how it is you can save your project and then share your project into a studio and I'm just gonna double check with my handy dandy schedule to make sure that's what videos we're doing next okay yeah so now that we've made a project I want to introduce this idea of like what what do you do with the project so want to make sure that the project is saved somewhere and so you can see here in the scratch editor we have we have to have no project let me just make a project really quick let's go back here let's go ahead and let's do our cat meowing project really quick so again that was super easy I've got a AB cat at the cat at the camp okay add the cat win video and motion ten starts ah meow okay make sure it works okay that's going okay so I have a project that I feel oh my god let's see the the the stop sign isn't gonna stop it you have to disconnect the box anyways so if you want to save it to your account you'll need an account so if you don't already have a scratch account you should make one scratch is awesome it's free do it so you hit the join button here if you already have an account you can go ahead and sign in so I'm gonna go ahead and sign into my cow speak locally which is a play off of speak visually which is my other username so you can see now I'm logged in to my scratch count and I'm going to hit the giant share button maybe before I share I want to name it so pet the cat okay get the cat okay and then I'm gonna hit that big ol orange share button okay now what happens when I hit the share button okay now I'm taken to this screen this screen yin is where the project is now shared in the scratch online community it is now available to the millions of scratchers out there what you might want to do is give instructions for people so like use all caps use your hands to look at the CAD tool and now you can if you want to share it like you're super excited and you'd like blasts it to all your friends and family the URL to the project is up here so you just copy paste this URL right here you can send it to anyone they'll be taken to this page they can love it they can favorite it they can play with your virtual cat it's super cool and if you want you can share your project into the studio that we have for today's create along which I actually lost the tab for so I'm gonna try to reopen it which is two video sensing which is you know what I didn't lose it it was just in another it was in another tab so if you want to share your project into the studio what you can do is you can have to log in eat locally okay so the studio by the way the studio description is in the link below this video so the studio description is in the link below and so you can go ahead and do it that way and then you just hit add project when you hit add project what you'll see is this button here to add and then you go ahead and add it like that and you've successfully added your project to the studio and so next week what we'll do is we will check out all of the incredible projects that were created doing this video sensing and in the meantime I'm kind of out of stuff for us to talk about I want to thank you for all the questions that you that you shared thanks for bearing with me as I was kind of getting my feet wet with all this whole live streaming thing I am so glad that next week Zoe is going to be taking over maybe I can go host another another week but it was a lot of fun and I really do encourage folks when you're making a video sensing project to think about keeping it simple thinking about that magical I'm gonna pull this up again that super magical wind video motion exceeds ten block that is just like the portal to so many cool things don't think about over complicating it and if you want to if you're kind of struggling for inspiration do check out the scratch online community there's a lot of really great projects and you can easily remix by introducing video sensing and so as you work on your projects throughout the week please do share in the studio super excited to next week show it off and definitely talking to you the person who asked the question about making a video sensing pong because I can't wait to play it so I hope you end up doing that and I want to thank again so EJC Natalie other folks from the rock team who have been helping behind the scenes with the create along and with that I think I'm going to get my long overdue glass of water say goodbye and want to thank you all again for hanging out for the entire hour I see there's 350 of you so happy scratching scratch on I'm gonna log off might take a nap kind of tired I hope you take a nap that was a lot of creating anyways wishing everyone well see you later as well I'm gonna have to figure out how to stop the stream so you're gonna awkwardly be looking at me for the next five seconds as I try to find a mouse cursor okay I found the end stream button I'm going to end the stream see y'all later
