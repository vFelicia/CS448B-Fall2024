welcome everyone to this scratch create along and a huge thank you to everyone for dealing with all these technical difficulties we're running into but we're all here now and let me just go over the beginning of the stream really quickly uh so uh this is the scratch create along in which you can make projects in a onehour live stream but with me Zoe also known as zinnia on scratch um and uh the plan for today I hope this isn't too much going over the same material but I just want to go over it uh for people who are just joining now um so here's the plan for today um which is that we all gather what I forgot to leave out of this plan what I forgot to put into this plan was spend many minutes dealing with technical difficulties um but you never plan that just happens um so we gather right now and then you will take a look at the projects that were shared two weeks ago and the projects that were shared of one week ago um usually we just look at last week's but uh due to other technical difficulties we're gonna look at the past two weeks this week and then we will I will share the prompt for this week's activity and then we'll all get to make projects using that prompt and I also think we'll go over a little bit today because we started late so thank you so much to everyone for your extreme patience in all of this but we're back on um oh and tell me if it ever gets too loud I think I tried to make my microphone really really loud enough but it might be too loud now but I'm looking at all your comments so I'll check it out so um let's take a look at the projects from two weeks ago I'll do that by clicking this button oh that is mine streaming software haha oh you comin out for a second you don't need to know how that looks but it's a great software um anyway so the the prompt from two weeks ago is was introduced character I loved seeing these projects so much oh my gosh with the prompt introduce a character people just took in so many directions I like you might have heard me I'm not sure if you heard me talk about this when I started trying to do this stream but I'm just gonna say what I wanted to say again in case you didn't because I know it was quiet before oh my gosh so many wonderful characters just like so many wonderful different types of animal characters like cats dogs fish horses bears just so much adorableness so many different types of creatures with actual pictures like dogs love that and then flowers I don't know that counts as an animal but I would loved it and then just like so many different original human characters like your characters here so we different varieties buta corn um yeah just like so people's different characters are so unique and like people did their favorite characters from books and games and stuff and it was just awesome I so thank you to everyone who joined it two weeks ago I love the studio and then last week uh he prompt was create a story and use projects for some wonderful as well like the just like seeing people's original artwork it seemed that like different types of ways of making a story interactive like a lot of these have different ways that you could like press a button to make something happen or to make a character say something but they're all different which is so cool uh so I love and they like oh cool animation and this one and this one like walking and fish animations so I love seeing these projects as well thank you to everyone who joined it a week ago also and now I think it's time to talk about this week's prompt let me switch it to being at my face up are you ready to hear this week's from I know technically it is in the title of a video but I'm just still gonna say so this week's prompt is make a virtual pet so I you can take that and anyway you want make a pet in scratch scratch has lots of characters in it that you can use to to they have one of those being your pet um that's a great place to start but you could also take a picture of your actual pet you have and make a project about that and I'll show you how to do all these things you could do a project of you know drawing your own pet someone actually asked a question if they could do that you told me we can um I'll show you how to do that as well you can make a completely fictional pet really just anything you want to do uh that sound good I hope so uh so I think let's get started um and if you're new to scratch or if it's been a while uh let me show you how you can get started with scratch so to do that where's that link yes uh you're going to want to go to a new tab scratch.mit.edu so yeah just go to scratch.mit.edu and I'll keep this link up for a little while in case anyone's going now welcome people joining now if you're joining now and again just a big THANK YOU to everybody for uh dealing with all of the audio troubles we had thank they're fixed now appreciate you all sticking with us um and I am so excited to make pets with all of you uh so let's go to so scratch.mit.edu and then you can click on create' and uh so it's to clicking on create well make a project and let me first just show you like the sort of basics of scratch which i will do if this page modes ever it'll load I'm sure it will and keep sending in your questions in this questions link uh all and I'll answer them um so let's close this tutorial that pops up so if it's your first time seeing it this is scratch this is a page where you can make a scratch project and in scratch you have these characters down here who are can be all the characters in your project and then over here you have these blocks that all sort of say something that a character could do so this one says move ten steps and in scratch if you click on a block it will actually make the character do that thing so if we click on this then the cat moves ten steps so you know and and you can kind of guess what it might do if you drag out one of these says turn 15 degrees it's probably make the cat spin in some way but let's let's see yeah so if we click on that it makes the cat turn um and you know this one go to random position I guess that's probably will make the cat you know let me zoom out a tiny bit attached to that one but you could also just have it be on its own but when I click that make the cat go to a random position and basically in scratch you can combine these in whatever way you want so if I want it cat to go to a random position and then turn 15 degrees you can click on that and it goes to a random position and then it turns and so that's like the basic idea of scratch and the these are all sorts of blocks that have to do with moving a character but there's also different things you can do to a character so there's like we could change how it looks like you could have it say something so you can have oh you know what maybe this code is a little bit under my video there you go um and I hope you all got the link to go to scratch.mit.edu slash create to start making the project like this maybe I'll take the link off now but there we go but if you're joining later in the stream you can send in a question and if you want me to say what that link is it's just scratch.mit.edu slash create uh so um anyway so you could click on this one and then it makes the cat say hello in a speech bubble um but you can have it say whatever you want you'd say hi friends I've misspelled friends didn't die hi friends so yeah the there's all kinds of blocks and you can sort of play around with different ones so that is the idea of scratch but if you still like more of an explanation send that into the comments and I'll uh I'll answer it so that's the basic idea of scratch but how can you get started making a virtual pet project well let me show you um maybe I will I will maybe get rid of the cat you could have the cat be your pet but maybe we can we can click the Delete icon to get rid of a cat and I would say a good first step in making a pet project is you can choose a pet and I say choose because in scratch we have a lot of premade characters and so if you hover over this button here this little tap it says choose a sprite and then you can go up to this icon and click Choose and it takes you to the sprite library which has tons and tons of premade characters and many and many of these any of these could make a great pet so you can scroll around oh I sell some questions coming in someone asks can I make more than one pets totally you totally can thanks that the question and I think someone else asked uh uh can you make an object be a pet you can totally do that too so I mean there's if you click on the animals category there are tons of animals you could choose from that could all make wonderful pets but you can also click type in thing in this search bar and which is a way of getting all of these objects we have and there could be lots of great pet options here too personally I think the rocks would make a fantastic pet also I thought the jar would be nice yeah so anyway you can totally make objects your pet but for now maybe I'll look at animals because this could be you know you can look at all of the animals we have here and pick one of these to be your pet so maybe I have always wanted a pet dragon uh so I'm going to pick the dragon to be my pet so that that could be a nice first step is just click on this button here choose a sprite and then and then pick out some creature to be your pet from seed so I hope you've all got to get to that point um you would also of course be independently doing your project while I'm talking about all this you know you but but if you'd like to hear some steps you could follow along so you can pick a creature be your pet and then you can let's see what what should we have our pic do to start out with uh it seems sort of nice to have our pet say something it's sort of introduce itself whoa I assumed in a lot blocks not very big oh maybe make them a little bit smaller yeah so drag that out and click on it and now you know the dragons saying hello my lovely little pet dragon here um so anyway that's that's nice say my name is what did the name of this dragon be let's see someone someone asked can you make a robotic head he totally can and maybe I'll make this dragons name a robot in honor of that even though it's definitely a real dragon so my name is robot that's cute cute little dragon name robot um and so you could you can not see maybe what this dragon to say this like when we start the project and to do that this this green flag button is button click to start a scratch project and now how do you make something happen when you click the green flag well you could go to over here to the events category and these are all blocks that can start something happening so this block will start things make things start happening when the green flag is clicked so you can drag that over here and now we've attached this when green flag clicked block to this save and now when I click the green flag it says that in a speech bubble uh so that is a way to start making a project with your pet now let me see let me see other ideas of things ways you could add to your pet project a one is you could choose a background for it to live in uh so that's just if you go down here uh you can click choose a backdrop and then got all these all these different backdrops to choose from I'm trying to think where I'd like my dragon to Lou I'm a big fan of this you like the forest I like the desert maybe I'll pick the desert uh so my drag on my dragon in the desert named a robot okay it's kind of nice to pick like a place for your pet to live and then you could also add sort of toys for your pet to play with or food for your pet uh and you can do that you can add as many sort of characters or objects to your project as you want so I'll go back to where I got my dragon from which is just hovering down here to choose a spring and then go up to click Choose and then uh there is this food category which I could click on and to get some idea of what my dragon might like for food hmm I think dragons would like cake yeah so now now we have a cake for our dragon so yeah I I think that's like oh yeah and there's one thing to notice when I added the cake it looked like all that code went away but that's just because when you've selected a character here you just see the code that's for that character because every character has their own blocks so the dragon does this it's like you know when the green flag is clicked it says my name is robot but the cake is not gonna do that the cake is you know doesn't those same things wouldn't apply to the cake you could make the cake do something else like oh we could so either we started that other one with this when the green flag is clicked block but we could start the cake doing something with this when this sprite clipped block which instead of it getting started when you click the green flag whatever you put here will get started when you click on the cake so we could make the cake in the up in the sounds category but there's this okay this is start sound walk which will start playing a sound so we can attach that there and and now when we click on the cake happy birthday sound anyway so I am I love this little dragon and it's cake uh so yeah that's kind of how I'd start making a pet project um but you know you could start any way you like and if you'd like more sort of tips or advice on how to get started them ask away no let me get to answering some questions um let's see so okay so someone asks where is the studio um the studio for this week is in the YouTube description for this video if you scroll down there's a couple of links and and one of them is those links to the the studio Ferb where these make a virtual pet project and you can add your projects to the studio if you don't know how to add to a studio don't worry at all I'll show that at the end of the string oh and also I should mention another one of the links down there is there is a bass starter project which you could have also used to get started in your project actually maybe I'll show that now so if you're if you're looking for another way to sort of jump into making your virtual pet another option is this starter project link in the description um and that link will take you here which is this virtual pet starter project um so when you open up this starter project you know it says like here are some ideas of things you could do you could change the pet change background let me show you how you could do that so you can click a see inside and clicking see inside will let you look into the the code of any scratch project and see how the person who made it did it um so in this project there's this monkey and has a football and bananas and a glass of water um and so you could you can do now that you've opened this up you could change it and make it roll that won't change the original project that the person made so it's the one of the suggestions was like maybe you want to not have a monkey have a different character so though what you could do is if you want to keep this these like we also you could just add a character from here like hover over choose a sprite and click Choose you could also just yeah let me show you how to do that I'll show you so hover over choose a sprite and click Choose and then maybe for this one instead of a monkey maybe we want attack that I think that that is adorable so I definitely want to pet that um and then now now I've got a pet back and the monkey you could if you wanted the back to still do these things you could take this like block of code and just drag it over to the back and then you see how it you just drag it over with a bats icon is and then click on the back it's right there so that's how you can get you know if you say you want the the these these things that the monkey does to apply in the back you can drag that over as well put that in as well and then maybe I'll get rid of the monkey and now we have a back instead um and maybe I want the back to say like what should the bat say um I would say hello um so anyway you could also change the background by clicking background uh and do whatever whatever I know wherever you want the bat to be uh I think the bat bat in the forest to be nice so yeah so that's you can just go in and change this code of this starter project however you want and yeah anyway let me know if you'd like more examples of how you could work with the starter project um let me look at these questions um okay uh someone says uh what is your favorite animal well it's a great question i I do love cats a lot also really love dogs if the fictional animals can count I would probably say dragon but I think that maybe Fox yeah so um anyway I think I think I think Fox is right now I love Fox also love owls I love a lot of animals uh and dragons a fun fact is when I was a kid I had a pet a tortoise um and I really wanted to have a pet dragon so my tortoises name is dragon because it was wishful thinking I also want like tortoises too clearly um okay more questions oh my god I don't see the question um okay uh Oh someone says uh can I draw my own pet you totally can let me show you a little bit of how you could do that um let's see I'll make a new project for this I'll show a few a few ways you could draw your own pay for it look going to anywhere I'm going is I'm going to scratch.mit.edu and gonna click on create' which is how you could create a new project so if you're just joining this dream now well it's really nice to have you join uh this is new scratch create along where we get to make a scratch projects together for an hour um we started a little bit late today because we had some audio issues which thank you so much everyone for your patience as we figured out what was causing those um and we're gonna go a little bit we'll go to like a little bit 10 minutes after today just so we get the full hour of creating stuff um so anyway the question that people just ask and oh yeah and if you're just joining now you can ask questions at this link uh that is right below um so yeah ask any kinds of questions you want um the question that someone just asked was um can I draw my own pet and I just wanted to show a few ways that you could draw your own pet so I'm going to get rid of a scratch cat goodbye dear scratch cat you will be missed um and then uh I'm gonna hover over this choose a sprite button but instead of clicking this choose you can go up to paint this option that appears and click paint and then that will take you to you know it makes a new sprite and you can actually uh just paint and control what it looks like um so I'll show a few tips of like for therefore drawing a character in this paint editor that appears drawing a pet that is um the this this mode of drawing is is one it's called vector art and it's one where you can create sort of shapes uh in your drawing and then you can actually move them around by clicking on this this select tool and you can also uh with this what it's like it'll say reshape tool you can actually sort of control you can you can edit the points of a shape and so there I just clicked somewhere and then I dragged it up and now it sort of looks a little bit like the ears of some creature and then I can click here to add another point here and I'll drag that down that's what I like really quick way of making years and let me show that for you again in case you missed how I did that so by clicking on clicking here clicking this circle tool I'll drag and make a circle and then you can click on this reshape tool and then anywhere and so it shows that this shape is made up of these four points they that and then it's like a curved line in between all points and then you can add more points to sort of the outline of your shape so if you want to have ears up here you could click a point here you just click anywhere on the outline to add a point and then you can drag it upward and that makes kind of a little ear and then you could do the same on this side I'll just click here on the outline and then drag that upward and then I'll also click at a point there and then drag it down and that makes kind of like a the top of the head so yeah the that's like some of how I get started with drawing um you can also make up a little just do a lot of drawing of your pet with just making circles so you can click up here to change the color of the circle your about to draw maybe I'll give this pet green eyes so you can click to change the color you click anywhere on this sort of rainbow color slider to pick what kind of color it is and then within that color you pick you can make it darker with this by dropping the brightness but by driving this brightness slider down actually maybe I'll make it have brown eyes and if you're wondering hi Michael Brown its if you go to orange it's a little counterintuitive but if you go to orange and then you drop the bring the brightness down then you can make a brown so I'll and then and then what I was saying is that with making circles you can make so much of a creature so you know some eyes can be sort of ovals or circles there and then maybe all to do a nose you could do another little oval and maybe I'll make the nose be black so I'll drag this brightness all the way down and then that'll make black and then if I make them nose going this direction yeah and and so anyway that's like a little bit of how you could start drawing a pet I love these little creatures cute maybe this will be like the parent or something oh and this is the child and so I think that's that's just some of how you can get started drawing with the vector paint editor and scratch I'm drawing a pet of your own but anyway sending more questions if you like more more ways you could draw a pet let's see okay flower asks um what are your tips on animating hi flower um so yeah that may be all all show some tips on animating um with this little character I drew I might um delete this character for now which I can do by clicking on this shape and then just clicking delete on my keyboard and then if I want to sort of move this towards the middle of the sprite the middle of this drawing I can click I with this with this select tool I can click and drag and then sort of drag it into the middle and it's actually really easy to Center it with this new tool you just Center it right there um nice so I think some of my tips on animating and maybe we can do a whole create along on animating because there's just so much so many different ways you can do it one of my tips on animating is I will duplicate this picture of that ID Ron so you don't have to draw it all the way like new again it'll start out with like a copy of it and then I'll just edit that second one a little bit actually let me do a mouse for this creature I will do and maybe I'll have that Mouse be also a black circle so I'll drag the color all the way the brightness all the way down to it black and and then I'll make a little mouth like that and and now I will duplicate so it's like talking so so let me show you how actually I did that really quickly because I'm gonna have it of it um you can to duplicate to copy the drawing you did you can click you can right click and then click duplicate and now you've got two of them so if I edit this one then I can then I can have two of these sort of costumes and then I can animate between them so I'll zoom in which bikes pressing this button and then you know one sort of easy way to start animating is just start sort of changing the shapes a bit so maybe if I was to make it talk I could have this one be like an openmouthed opposed and then have this one I couldn't squash this shape in and now we have like a sort of a closed mouth pose so if I switch between these it's like it's talking and so and then now I'm switching between these by clicking on one or the other and by the way anyone who's wondering why I'm not wrapping up yet I'm gonna go a little bit over today I'm gonna go to about 210 Eastern Time okay because it started a little bit late so we'll get a little bit of focus time to go um so let's go back to the so anyway so now you've got this little animation where it has the two different poses and that'll go back so but how can you do that in the code how could you make it switch between there's this really helpful block in the looks category uh which is this next costume walk and let me zoom in a bit so with this next costume block uh you can actually switch between the costumes in the code and and then now before in the stream I was showing that in the let's say I wanted to do this animation when I click the green flag because the green flag is sort of like a start button for scratch projects um what you do is connect this little next costume block to a when green flag clicked block because if you have a win green flag clicked off and anything you attach to it will will happen when you click the green flag so I can click the green flag and now it makes a little bit and you can even um put that in a loop now what's a loop it will make it a loop is let me show you what one is a loop is just one of these blocks that's sort of like a mouth that says repute or forever and what it does is it just if you put uh you can see that this little shake here a block will fit really nicely there any block that you put inside a loop will happen as many times as the loop tells it to so this if you put this next costume inside this repeat ten loop oh my gosh animated it so fast because it's just doing its costume X costume really really quickly so let's put a weight in there let's slow it down we'll have it do next costume and then wait one second and now if I click it yeah it like animates them out open and close um but you know one second is a little bit long maybe I'll change it to something like point three zero point three seconds and then it opens the mouth so you can have it be talking and then you can attach this to the green flag to have it sort of talk when you click the green flag so those are some of my tips on animating maybe we'll do more stuff about animating later because it's very very fun but yeah thanks for the question flower um okay um let's see Oh someone asks um can we just take a photo of our pets yes totally you could take a photo of your pet how'd it be in the project you could take a photo of like a book or something we are one second I have this Totoro journal I kind of want to make a pet project with this taking a picture of this Totoro journal and have it meet my pet because it's extremely cute so yes you can take a picture of your pet you'd also take a picture of an object around you have that be your pet um someone asks also um do i oh yeah can you add a picture from the internet totally make sure you give credit to the image in like the notes and credits of your project but totally uh oh my gosh infinity of cute animals on the internet but would be great in youth projects and you know we have another question about the paint editor um someone asks what's the difference between vector and bitmap some great questions your source all these are such great questions yeah let me show you the difference between vector and bitmap so I mentioned before that um that this is drawing in vector art mode in a vector art here's here's sure the the features of vector art let me pick out like a red color so you can see it a little bit better than a lot in in vector art mode you it's really good for making shapes and then changing them later so I can drag around to create this circle but then I could decide that I want the circle over here and grab it pull it over there or you know I could decide that I want to click on this reshape tool and grab one of the points of it and make it like a scene it's really easy to just make those changes so it's it's it's vector art is not like that's not that easy to like draw as you would on a piece of paper it's it's you more think about the shapes that something and then you can like create those shapes and then it's really easy to change them if you want to now on the other hand let me hover over oh you know what I can hide the the I think this would work oh yes haha I added a new trick I can hi to the questions button if I want to show something it's down here um and thank you all for sending in comments but that would have been helpful um so down here if you click on choose a costume uh you can actually click up paint and paint a new costume I'll paint a new costume to show you uh I know I'll put the questions link back up um to show you what that mode is like so that's vector mode it's good for making shapes and then moving them around changing them whenever you want to now if you click down here you can click convert to bit and now we are in bitmap mode and these tools on the side change and you know what bitmap mode is good for is it's really good for painting directly on the canvas so it's a little bit more similar to drawing on a piece of paper the first you know tool here is this brush tool and so you can write something you could draw something so I could draw a oh wow my computer's a little laggy so this is gonna be quite a angular creature but you could draw a face with some ears and draw eyes and a little smile oh my gosh I love this will be um Wow so cute and then you can click on the fill bucket and color it in can make the color a little bit my pale click and you know click with the fill bucket so it's it's a bitmap sort of makes it easy to just draw right on the canvas but then the drawback is that you if let's say I was like oh ok no I want to move this right here you can't there's no select tool you can't like grab that right here you have to like select something in a rectangle but then you can't just get the you're also gonna get the face too so you know that it in vector it's really good because you can you can undo so it gets its year back in vector you could do that so you could be like actually no I want the C over here so it's like a phone that this creature is calling on much made it smaller um then I could be like actually no nevermind I should want to see you over here you can change your mind you can you can move things but in bitmap you can't so so that's like the difference between vectors but not thank you for the great question um let's see do okay and I noticed that YouTube is is cutting the stream in and out occasionally um so sorry for the stream drops that you're experiencing I hope we can make that better as well um and I think we'll start wrapping off in like five minutes but I mean you can answer just a couple more questions um you do so okay you've got questions someone says um how do you edit sprites it's also a great question let me show you so if you hover over this choose a sprite button and click Choose we can so I showed how to draw some of your own sprites you can also edit sprites from the library here so let's pick up character to edit to BR hit yeah edit this butterfly uh so sorry my computer is being a little bit slow so and let's so we'll go over to the to the code and and so now we got this butterfly that could be our pet um and how you can add a sprite is so let's say you're you're coding your pet in and you're in you're in this code tab you can click over to this costumes tab and now you can edit that character in the paint editor so you could click on this fill bucket and recolor some segments of it so click there all the wings to recolor it or you cou like you could click on the select tool and select everything and you grab this anchor down here you could rotate it so yeah those that's the those are like how you can edit edit sprint is you you might start me starting out from the code tab but you can just click on the costumes tab and edit the Xperia P rinse of a sprite so yeah thanks for that question yeah let's see someone else asks can you make food for your pet totally so one way you could do it is if you hover over this choose a sprite button here and click shoes then we have tons of food you can choose from like right over here if you click on the food category it's an easy way to get all of it you could add in any of these foods you want so maybe your pet loves bread maybe it loves fruit salad its fruit salad it's very fun um so you can add food for your for your sprite that way you can also upload a picture of food so if you hover over the choose a sprite button here but then go all the way up to upload yeah you could just upload a picture of food for your sprite and and you could also go to paint and then you do and then you could draw your own food so like I think I could probably draw an apple very easily so go to the circle and click on the color and set it to red and then that's an apple but also if I wanted to make it a little bit more clear that it was an apple you can click on this lime tool and you can draw a little line maybe I will click the select tool and select this line and make it a little bit bigger a little increase the thickness of the line oh yeah now you got a little apple that's like super simple food do do Oh someone asks what is the big t shape in the editor this I think thank you for talking about this T shape this is a text tool so you can actually click on that and let set the color to like red or something and then you can click somewhere and write text so I'm an apple so that's what that tea is is you can write actually write text right there that's right oh thank you for all these questions um let me see if I have time to answer one of them really really quickly and then I'm gonna wrap up this question was can we make our pet follow our mouse pointer yes you totally can let me show you how to do that let's say we want the butterfly to follow our mouse pointer so we can click on the butterfly and then there is this block that says glide 1 seconds to random position when you drag that out and then click on it to see what it does so it makes it the butterfly glide to a random position actually this blog has a menu so you can click on random position and actually you could choose mouse pointer from the menu so now if I click on this block the butterfly actually glides to my mouse pointer so my mouse pointer was there because I was clicking on that so so this glide 2 mouse pointer block could be helpful for that now the butterfly went to my mouse pointer once but how do I make it go I to my mouse pointer over and over again so we keeps following it well if you meant remember these loops that I talked about earlier in the stream in the in the control category we could drag out this forever block and then just put it here and then if we put the glide 1 seconds mouse pointer
