is this thing on right now do we know I think it is oh oh hi everyone um my name is Eric also known to speak visually on Scratch and I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on Scratch and we're from the MIT scratch team and you're probably wondering right now why you're watching video on the scratch website that's a good question uh so we're doing an experiment a video series where we want to highlight three things one inspiring things that we're seeing in the community two cool creative things that you can try and three messages from the scratch team which could include uh highlighting new features and things going on in our headquarters here cool so with that said we can jump into our first segment called love it um and so these are inspiring things we've seen in the community and there are a lot of inspiring things but we just picked out one or two things um so what I found in the community um really inspiring was this collaboration and it was um sort of um organized by the user hello yo was up which is how I greet everyone when I see them um and it's called I Am the Doctor and it's essentially a massive animated project in map um and what what it is it's a story and different scratch users I think there was like 12 or 15 of them all created a different part of the animation and then hello yo was up put them all together in this really like long beautiful scratch project and the link to that is in the comments is in the description below this video cool well another thing that we thought was another collaboration done by Hobson DTV DTV and it's called the life of Baldwin and Hobson Dash TV starts It Off by introducing Baldwin who's kind of misunderstood by his parents wants him to become a sonographer but uh his true passions are dot dot dot and so at this point Hobson DTV ask the community to leave suggestions in the project comments for where the story can go and it's been really cool to see the story of so check it out cool and what else did you find inspiring in the community leave it uh your answer in a comment below um and so with that let's go on to the next segment which is called triple t t cubed it's things to try um and these are cool things that are happening in the community um so you might have noticed the scratch design studio and essentially a scratch design studio is a featured Studio that has uh a specific theme and it changes every month uh and this month is Once Upon a dinner and it's essentially the the theme is if you could have dinner with anyone who would it be and so if you go to the homepage you'll see the uh the row that says Once Upon upon a dinner so just go in there you can check out um the projects and if you want to make your own project you can just leave a comment in that studio with the project and a curator We'll add it cool another thing to try is uh next week we have hour of code which is a week long but it only the activity will only take you about an hour and these are cool activities uh that include uh design a holiday card uh animate your name and create a pong game and uh these activities are created in celebration of Computer Science Education week and it's an opportunity for people to try new things with coding for about an hour and so you'll probably see a lot of new people in the community so make sure to say hi hello show them something cool in scratch uh our community is going to grow so make sure to welcome them and speaking of growing um we actually have three new moderators they joined about 2 months ago and you might have seen them um the three moderators we have agent pineapple we have AC house and we have hadada and so feel free to join um join in and welcoming them into the scratch Community I've actually left um links to their about me projects so you can go ahead and check those out and learn more about um the new mods cool well I think that ends our first video and uh we're still trying to figure out a name so if you have any suggestions leave us a comment and otherwise I guess next time yeah until next time see you in the community scratch on bye
