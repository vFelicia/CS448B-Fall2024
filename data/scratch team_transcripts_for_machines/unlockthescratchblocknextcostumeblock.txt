foreign costume block so I can animate this fox I want to make it wag its tail so we'll go to the costumes tab and delete these other poses then to duplicate this costume I can just right click or long press select duplicate and now I can select the tail rotate it a little bit stick it back on if I go back to my code I can click next costume to make the Tail Wag let's do that in a forever Loop that's too fast so we'll add a weight block and weight 0.2 seconds now the Tails wagon I can add more costumes to make the animation smoother what will you animate with the next costume block thank you
