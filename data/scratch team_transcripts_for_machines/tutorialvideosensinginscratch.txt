hey everyone its peak usually here from the scratch team at MIT and today I want to show you how to use video sensing blocks if you're not familiar with video sensing it allows someone to interact with your scratch project using the webcam on their computer so it's a really cool set of blocks I'm excited to show you how to use those today so we will find the video sensing blocks in the sensing category so let's go ahead and click that and the three video sensing specific blocks are right here so we see one is a variable and it's video motion on this sprite we see a block that says turn video on and finally set video transparency so we'll dig into all three of these how about we start with this middle one here turned video on so this is really turning the webcam on which will enable the ability to have video sensing on your project so we'll go ahead I just drag that out let's go ahead and make it an event so when green flag clicked turn video on okay cool so the webcam has been turned on and you can see the image in the background is actually the feed from the webcam and so this is really important because well we will use this later on when we use when you create these sort of interactions in our project so you notice there's actually kind of a bit of a white haze over the webcam and that is actually the backdrop that is being displayed on top of the webcam image and that can be manipulated here with the set video transparency so right now it's at 50 percent so it's 50 percent sort of seethrough if we make it a zero and then click the green flag we can see that we are seeing zero percent of the backdrop and if we likewise if we change it to 100 we see 100 percent of our white backdrop okay so let's try to find a happy medium so let's go 50 percent so we see some of the backdrop overlaid with some of the webcam footage ok the road cam feed I should say so let's go ahead now and create some sort of interaction I think the most fun part of video sensing so the third and final block that we haven't talked about yet is right down here and this is a variable and this variable is going to detect the amount of motion and so we we have a scale between zero which is like in no motion and 100 which is like going crazy and we can measure that on a sprite okay so how much motion is happening underneath the sprite here so video motion on this sprite we could also detect it based on how much is how much motion is happening on the entire stage right so we could just change that trap down to save that so let's stick with the video motion on this sprite and so I mention it's on a zero to 100 scale so let's see what that scale looks like so if we go down here next to the block we can click this little box here which is going to turn on a reporter which is going to give us the amount of motion that's happening here so we can see right now if nothing's happening it fluctuates between 0 and 1 but if I were to go like this we see we see these values approaching 20 30 100 okay and so you can do that with a lot of other variables too with these so by clicking this checkbox yeah all right so let's go ahead and make a little mini script a little mini project to show how you might use this this new block that we have so let's make it when I go like this we have the cat meow so what we'll do is we'll take our nice little simple script here and let's go ahead and say forever let's ask a question so forever be asking an if/then question and let's drag out an operator and let's say if something is greater so a video motion here is greater than 20 again remember we're measuring it from 0 to 100 so 20 is going to be kind of moving like this over the cat if that happens let's have the cat meow so I'll go ahead and drag out the block play sound meow until done and so again the script will say if video motion which we're calculating here seeds is greater than 20 how about you go ahead and play the sound Jin meow so let's go ahead and try this okay very nice so it is working we're see we were hearing the cap now so that is a very simple script how you might use the video sensing blocks to create some small interactions in your scratch project so I hope that was helpful and I look forward to seeing what it is you create with video sensing blocks
