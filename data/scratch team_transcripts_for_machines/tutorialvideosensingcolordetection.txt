hey everyone its erik here from the scratch team I'm super excited to show you how it is you can use video sensing and color detection in scratch to create some pretty remarkable programs so I think we should start with just Rifa miliar izing ourselves with this notion of color detection in scratch so I've read a simple program here where as you can see if I press the right arrow key the cat is moving to the right and if I press the left arrow key the cat is moving to the left so what if we want to add some color sensing into this project so what I'll do is I'll go to the backdrop and say we want to have the cat hit something that is red and the cat says ow so I've clicked the backdrop I'm gonna go ahead and draw a shape and I'm just gonna go ahead and make it a giant red circle I'll go ahead and always drop it here okay now I'll go back to my scratch cat sprite I'll go back to the scripts and what we want to say is if the cat is touching this red blob let's pretend it's lava have the cat say out and what we do is we'll use a sensing block for this so we'll make a statement that uses this block here touching color let's go ahead and drag this out and we can go ahead and select the color that we want to sort of interact with so you do that by clicking this button and that will have a color picker so you can see as I mouse over things it's showing me the color go ahead click the red okay so the color is touch now nothing's gonna happen we haven't really built a script yet around this but this is sort of the magical block if you will so let's go ahead and build a script that says when touching so when green flag is clicked let's go ahead and make an ifthen statement so if then so if scratch cat is touching this color let's go ahead and have scratch cat say oh okay cool now this isn't going to actually work if we hit and we try it and it's not gonna work cuz this is a question that only gets asked once so an ifthen statement gets asked once and that happens immediately after I hit the green flag so I want to do is I want to wrap this question here in a forever loop so I'm gonna forever be asking if I'm touching this color so let's go ahead and run it again and see okay cool so we're in good shape so we made a really simple program here on the screen that says win scratch cat hits the red blob on our backdrop say ow objectively that is a really useful thing to know how to do in scratch but let's take this a step further wouldn't it be cool if scratch cat can interact with objects not on the backdrop but sort of in the physical world and we can do this using video sensing which enables us to use the webcam to interact with scratch projects so to do this what I'm gonna do is actually let's just start with a white backdrop so I'll put my backdrops and I'll just click a white backdrop let's go back to our scratch cat here now first things first let's go ahead and start video sensing and what you can do it's really simple we'll just run the script that says win green flag clicked let's go ahead in the sensing category you'll see this block turned video on and when I click this it's going to enable video sensing which turns on the webcam so you can see the webcam here I have pointing down on a sheet of white paper so video sensing has been enabled and what we can do is let's use the same concept we have here but instead of drawing anything on the backdrop remember we did this let's go ahead and use a Lego piece that is red and see what happens so let me go to my bin here let me grab a Lego and let me set it down here on our little stage here and the same concept of when touching is going to actually work here so I will go to the right and see okay nothing is happening so that looks like this red color here doesn't match the red of the Lego so I'll go ahead and select the red of the Lego which looks like a little bit of a darker red and I'll go ahead and do it and so you can see the webcam and video sensing all so detects color so no matter where I move this will see whoops I can't move up yet so it's going to be able to detects it so this is really the magic that unlocks a lot of things and really the possibilities of what you can do are like not to be cliche they're really endless and so I just want to show you here I'll jump to like three examples of what it is you can do using again video sensing and color detection this simple script that we just put together so here's a music making program that I created super simple scripts these are all the scripts here I just created a black bar that travels from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and that's here in this script and when that black bar touches a leggo of a certain color it'll play a specific note so you know when it's touching a green it will play see when it's touching orange will play E when it's touching a it'll play when touching red it'll play the a note so here it is so I don't know it's kind of a silly project but you can be sort of mixing music live and changing the code and it's quite cool it's a good project to sort of start playing with so here's a project that allows you to juggle cats and dogs and so what that's doing is I'm triggering the sounds based on the color of the balloon and there's something kind of cool about this project is actually I made a really large blacks right that takes up the entire screen and using the ghosts effect I hid that sprite so you can see here it goes to effect 99 I'll change it to zero so you can see what I'm talking about this is the sprite and so whenever I touch that which is pretty much the whole stage it'll trigger these sounds but to hide this bright I went ahead and set the transparency of that to sort of 99 so now you see this bright kind of looks like it disappeared but it's really there so whenever something touches it look down here it's really touching this bright even though it's quite hidden and I'm using the simple scripts here touching color to play to sounds so this final example I want to share with you is a simple platform game than it made using video sensing so you can see here the green acts as like a bounce pad the red acts as lava so you want to avoid that and the black is the ground and so what I've done is I've just sort of remixed an existing platform game and I want to point you to this code here where you can see the floor script here is using wind touching color and I've selected the color of the floor by sort of mousing over I'm selecting my black and that's the case for the lava and the bounce pad and etc anything you want to add to this I'm gonna sort of wave my hands above the rest of the scripts here and encourage you to check out some platformer tutorials there are plenty out there on YouTube and on scratch but the basic concept of this idea of having your objects be moveable and that you can interact with them sort of it works in this real time for the game creation so I've encourage you to check that out and all of the projects that I've shared with you I'll provide a link in the description of the video or even at the end of this video so you can check it out and remix and so I wish everyone a great time creating and tinkering with the video sensing and color detection it's really remarkable to see what is you can make you
