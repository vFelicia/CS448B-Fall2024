hi everyone welcome to episode six of our scratch video updates I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on Scratch and uh I am Eric also known as speak visually on Scratch and we're joining you today for the sixth episode of the scratch video update on the sixth floor deck of the MIT media lab and it's finally warm this is the first warm day we've had in a long time in Boston so Boston can be beautiful be not like that other update that we had in January um so we're glad with you uh we want to start with our first segment Rick Ros is holding the phone but love it the love it section so these are projects that we found in the community that we love and we want to share with you um and the project that I found is actually um it's a contest that's happening and it's called chopped it's a chopped contest and I'm not sure if you've ever seen the television show I think it's called chopped but it's essentially where you create your own dish and you share it with people and since this is scratch um you create a scratch project with your dish and so people are creating different uh Entre and and sharing them um in a scratch project it reminds me of the edible scratch that we released on April 1st a little bit that was a lot of fun so the project that I love that I saw recently is called adopt an alpaca by Care Bear 17 and you can uh play with an alpaca that you name yourself and uh you can Farm you can uh shower the Alp Al you can also transform your alpaca I turned mine into a uni PKA or a rainbow PKA and uh it's just fun to kind of play with the the aeka you adopted in this project cool and then so I guess our next segment is things to try oh my gosh things to try sorry I almost hit you in the face this things to try um and there are a lot of things to try in the community um but I think one thing that I saw um that I think is fun to jump into is the scratch Design Studio we just released a new one it's create a planet and so it's a really sort of openended prompt where you say well what kind of planet would you create and so we've got a couple hundred projects shared already uh one that sticks out to me was a planet it was like it was it was around the theme of cotton candy the planet was made out of cotton candy and it had a moon that was made out of chocolate which I thought it was pretty sweet wow that's that is very sweet yeah that is sweet pun intended one I that was cool okay so I'm on an alpaca theme right now and so it's called an alpaca planet and you can walk around with a Rover and kind of explore the planet I thought that was cool super awesome so make sure to check that out check out the projects and definitely make one as well we also have another thing to try uh we had mentioned scratch day I think about a month ago in the last video update and we've officially launched the website so it's day. scratch.mit.edu you're probably wondering what is scratch day it's essentially just it's a Global Network of events where people come together to celebrate scratch and so that can mean having a pizza party at your house or coming to MIT where we host 300 people for to celebrate scratch so really whatever it is you want to make it you can check out the scratch day website to find out resources on sort of Hosting your own scratch day or finding other scratch days so it's coming up when is it May 9th May 9th but you can host the scratch day anytime and you can have it any time of the year but there something fun about doing it around May 9th with everybody else yeah definitely and then so since we're actually joining you on the sixth floor because we have an event at the media lab called member event where all the groups uh at the media lab share what it is they're working on and we thought it'd be nice we're part of the lifelong kindergarten group uh at the media lab and so we wanted to show you what some of the students are working on in our research group cool let's jump over to our space hi everyone Welcome to our lifelong kindergarten space ready to visit some projects so some scratch demos over here so our first project is Lea who's one of the students hi so I'm working on a project called making good stories where I'm trying to help children to um make things that tell stories about their lives using electronics and computational Tool so as you can see here's an example of a big textile mural with uh electronics embedded inside with like this tiny little computer called Lily tiny which you can sew uh other example is this card where you can see a princess or a girl is dreaming and while she's dreaming she's trying to blow the bubble which are represented with lights now if you see inside there's this tiny little chip that's making the light glow but it's making the light glow like in different patterns like fading you can see it's bright and them and similarly you can make other kinds of projects so yeah that's all I do cool so we're going to shift over to another student so this is Dave he's another graduate student in the group and he's going to share the project with you yeah so I've been um working on helping people make their own electronic products and the best example of that I guess is my DIY cell phone so this is a cell phone I made myself and use every day and um trying to help other people make things like this uh also lots of other kinds of products like radios and speakers and mice and various sorts of Internet connecting things as well so cool well so those are just a couple of projects in the group and I hope you enjoyed the tour there's also all right welcome back everyone I hope you enjoyed the tour of our lab and learning more about our different projects that we have we'll see you one month from now for our next scratch video update in the meantime I think we're going to enjoy this beautiful day all right see you bye
