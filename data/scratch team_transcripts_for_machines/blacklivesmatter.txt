The Black Lives Matter movement is to say that Black lives matter as much as other lives. All people should be treated equal and no one should be mistreated just because of their race and color. Most people already think that White people matter, you don't need to say it. Basically what it says, Black lives matter. Since I've been old enough to talk, it's been in everyday life. I feel like they shouldn't be treated this way anymore. I realized that I needed to make a stand for this. I should at least do it for myself too. My Black Lives Matter project starts with the fist, it stands for unity and strength. I wanted to raise awareness and because what happened with George Floyd, and not just him, what happened to other people in the past and present. I just saw that the community was doing Black Lives Matter. I was really proud because finally I can actually show people that I cared about it. I was in a virtual protest of Black Lives Matter. My Scratch project about Black Lives Matter is like a normal platformer, but the the different thing is that Scratchers can learn about Black Lives Matter while playing the platformer. The theme of my project is unity. And it's to say that in 2020, the most important thing is to remain united. I was a little nervous 'cause I thought some people will start arguments in the comments. And I thought some people will just ignore it. When people started to actually remix it and put in their own fist, I realized that a bunch of people actually care. I saw a lot of projects being made about Black Lives Matter in all sorts of ways. There were like poems or art. When people are seeing your art, maybe you can change the way they see the world. Doesn't matter what your age is, because sometimes when you're younger, you're braver. I can be a part of change and I can also make an impact on the world. I hope that Black lives don't get treated the same like they do now. I hope that they actually do matter like they're saying.
