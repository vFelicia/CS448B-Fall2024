I was searching for interactive programming language on the Internet and I came across Scratch as soon as I shared my first project I got instant feedback and I was like okay I want to continue with this I remember my first project was a super simple animation I'm still actually really proud of my first project it opened my eyes to the different possibilities that coding can present so I've been drawing basically since preschool when I liked how to hold a crayon I think making art with scratch is different because I can collaborate with other people and make something interactive that other people can use there was a song that said happy happy birthday I put scratch in there it just became an instant hit on the side and fire going people to make their own songs and remixes everyone can do anything with my products and sometimes it's really funny how they change things at the end it just goes to show like how much you can actually do with all the things you have in scratch when you're looking at other people's projects you're engaging on such a different level which really encourages this kind of mindset of seeing yourself and each other as makers of things and not just consumers so I never thought that I could do like the coding part like I thought like absolutely I'm a grownup and like hire someone to code it for me but then I was like hey I can actually do this myself it gets more complex but once you know the basics you can add on to your knowledge and move at your own pace if you like solving problems if you like drawing if you like making music if you're into anything scratchy is for you you
