foreign work in scratch well as I move the cat around these numbers down here are changing and showing you the X and Y position I can get a backdrop called grid to help show what the X and Y coordinates are suppose I wanted to use the go to block to bring the cat to this point over here that's at x minus 100 and why 100 now when I click the block the cat goes there another little tip as I move the cat around some blocks in the motion category automatically update so suppose I want to bring the cat into a particular spot now I can just grab the block and when I move the cat away I can click that block to go back there we're just scratching the surface foreign
