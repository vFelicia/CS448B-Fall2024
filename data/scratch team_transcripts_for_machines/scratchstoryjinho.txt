I remember reading the news... and thinking that I should so something about this... But I don't know what I should do about it? And then I listened to this song "Hands." It featured different artists coming together and singing a song together and I thought why couldn't we scratchers create something together? I have a multi animator project that like we scratchers made together after the Orlando tragedy that happened to honor the people who died in the Orlando tragedy this project is a multi animator project which means that each like each part was animated by a different animator and we all stitched it together to create the final product I think around 40 or 50 people were involved making that project. Scratch is a really open place or you can like share anything you want and you can express your feelings however you want and I think that's a really beautiful part of it Mh hope for the project when I shared it with the community was to be able to reach out to some of the other people in this generation and know that there are people who support them.
