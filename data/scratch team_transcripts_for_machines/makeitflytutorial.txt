Trees? Rainbows? It can be anything you want “Huraaay” Now here come the cool part To make the character look like it is flying move the scenery behind it “OOOOOhhh” And look your character is flying Its pretty awesome what you can do with code “That was amazing” That’s not all you can do Want to make your character interactive? Make it move when you press the arrow keys “That was the greatest thing I have ever seen” Now it is time to make it you own Add hearts, clouds, unicorns or any other floating thing in the sky “Okay how about this?” You can add a score and make it a game “Game on” Or you can add more characters to fly with you You could fly alongside the powerpuff girls.
