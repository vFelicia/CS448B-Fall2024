hi everybody i'm shannon pica also known as champ 99 on scratch and I'm Eric also known as visually on scratch welcome to scratch video update so the theme of this month's episode is scratch day scratch day what is scratch the area that's that's a good question so I would describe scratch day as a global celebration of scratch and the people who scratch and the way it's celebrated is there's events that happen all over the world I think there's about a thousand events that happened and that will continue actually to happen where people just come together and they scratch and it's a great time and it also happens somewhat in the online community people celebrate scratch day and that's actually what we're gonna highlight so the Lovat section is scratch state projects that we loved in the community the online community there's a really awesome platformer called I think it's trash day platformer by ferial two to eight and you essentially it's a platformer game where you try to go to your scratch day event there's a bunch of obstacles I won't ruin the ending but it is worth the I think twenty different levels that you have to go through I'm pretty bad at platformer games so maybe just try it out try that what about you what is a project called scratch day remix chain thank you bye forever yeah and it's actually a project from last year but we still want to call it out cuz it's awesome it's a project that celebrates scratch day where each it's collaborative so each person takes a balloon and passes it on exactly check it out you know we just passed it between two people but there's like 50 people it's a really cool the remix chain gets really busy long let me check that out speaking of things to check out and try the things to try section what are fun things happening in the online community well since this is a scratch day theme I think I want to call out there's a bunch of really great scratch birthday cards that were given to sort of scratch cat to celebrate scratch day and it's always really great take cards I don't know maybe I don't get many cards I'm gonna get you but when I get a scratch project as a card it means a lot and so thank you everyone for sending those cards and I think the thing to try might be actually we have a nice tutorial activity on making your own cards it's available it's scratched on mit.edu flashcards and it sort of steps through how did you might make a card and I would totally encourage you if you have upcoming birthdays or just celebrations graduations to make a scratch card and and send it to someone it's special people love it I'm not saying we want a scratch card there might be a shadow for you on the next video update who knows no promise no promises anyways so that's our thing to try all right message from the scratch team okay alright so absolutely actually normally we have a message from the scratch team but we thought this time we would do a message from everyone who came out to the scratch day at MIT and that message is but it's much louder thank you for hanging out with us we have a giant flute we're gonna pop it three we'll see you in a month for the next class video update grandpa's happy scratch day oh wow that was we have to clean all this up
