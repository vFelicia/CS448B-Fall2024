hi everyone I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on scratch hi I'm Eric also known as speak visually on Scratch and welcome to the that was so awesome hey everyone uh welcome again to the scratch video update uh we're joining you in Paris France uh we took a hop over from scratch conference in Amsterdam to Paris uh to film here well if you're wondering what the scratch conf conference is uh it's an opportunity for teachers developers and researchers to come together to talk about scratch and share different resources and ideas and um by the way that's notredam behind that's the notredam cathedral in the center of par is yeah and uh so we're going to show you some clips of our Reflections from The Experience starting with our love it the loveed section oh gosh the love section from scratch conference one of the Keynotes that was offered was done by Linda Lucas who's an author uh she created this amazing children's book uh that she's going to tell you about and she wanted to create a book uh to introduce young kids to computational culture and thinking in a friendly and fun way cool so here's Linda let's check it out my name is Linda luas I'm a children's book author and illustrator and I write stories about computers and the computational thinking world and and this is my first book it's about a little uh girl called Ruby and her best friend the computer and here you can see Ruby in her own little room and can you recognize who is on Ruby's wall but Ruby is actually a really special little girl because when her dad tells her that she needs to dress up for school she does dress up but she leaves her pajamas on because Dad didn't specifically tell her to take the pajamas off and when Ruby is told that oh your room is such a mess you need to clean up all your toys they are everywhere she does clean up the toys but she leaves her pens and papers on the floor because pens and papers are not really toys and in the same way when you give instructions to a computer you need to give them in the right order uh in the right sequence be very specific with the names and yeah that way you'll be able to instruct also Ruby for early very very cool okay so I think one of my Levits from the conference we had what was called a poster session which is essentially people working on cool things set up a booth and they sort of talked about what it is they're doing with scratch and so a lot of things stuck out but maybe just to mention a couple one was a uh a a device in which it could it could track when you were linking uh and uh a young person his his mom is a doctor and works with someone who can't actually move their limbs or speak and so using this device uh when she blinked the scratch project would move on a letter and she could actually communicate via blinking through a scratch project which I thought was like a really inspiring use of scratch in the real world uh and so that made me think uh a lot and uh I have to say I was really excited so scratch on tablets is like a thing that's being worked on and so some of the developers on the scratch team uh showed off the early stage demo of scratch on tablets and it is very cool there's still more work that needs to be done but it was there and then one final thing uh is so the scratch is you're always using it on the computer screen but uh someone said oh how cool would it be if you actually like took blocks in real life and put them together and ran uh like a a scratch project so they this one guy had a device where you can put scratch blocks on this sort of panel and then it would make this horse Spin and so you can program like with with using your hands which was really cool cool so now let's move on to our next session things to try things to try all the way in France and so one thing to try is also we ran into Eric rosenbom who's the cocreator of miy Makey and he had a new project to share called Beetle blocks and um Eric is going to show us a quick clip of what that looks like hi I'm Eric Rosen bomb I'm former member of the scratch team you may know me as Eric r on scratch also coinventor of the Makey Makey uh but now I'm going to show you my project Beetle blocks which is like scratch for 3D printing you can write some code which generates a 3D shape which you can then print out uh so I'll show you how that works a little bit so over here there's a little beetle the beetle we can make move around using the blocks so I click on this move block mle takes a step forward the rotate block makes it turn and then I can make it put a little Cube down at each step and then I can use the repeat block to make it put those cubes around a ring so what else can you do um this project makes a hexagon and then rotates the hexagon and scales it so it makes it bigger as it rotates around pretty cool shape um this is a beetle blocks snail and here is a little Beetle so you can try it out at be blocks.com we're still working on it um we'd love to hear your feedback cool and so I think my things to try you know I'm always talking about the scratch Design Studios and so we do have a new scratch design studio uh it's around the theme of custom blocks so make a block uh and if you're not familiar with makeup Block it's just you can actually Define your own custom block and scratch uh and if you're not familiar with custom blocks don't worry because the scratch Design Studio curators have created two projects that will help you learn more about custom block so I encourage you all to check it out yeah awesome actually one other thing I'd add about Eric's project is that it's still in the very very early stages so it might be a little glitchy Beetle blocks it's in the early stages very cool though we'll share a link okay so now we'll move on to message from the scratch team yes we're drumming okay we're drumming oh yeah yeah yeah sorry so one of the Keynotes that emres uh delivered also known as Mitchell Resnik uh we thought it was a great message to the community and we thought we shareed with you and he wanted to talk about why coding and why scratch and he talked about three ideas to you know to think about why why we code and one was your voice you know expressing yourself another was thinking and how the ways that coding can help you think in creative ways and finally identity and how you can see yourself as a Creator and see the ways that you can shape the world and we thought that was a beautiful message to share with uh with everybody else so I think as a final thing yeah and as a final thing so in the spirit of voice we actually walked around uh the scratch conference which is very International and we wanted to hear from the participants in the scratch Pro uh scratch conference if there were three words that in which you can describe scratch how would you define scratch uh and so check out we got about six or seven people to to say what they what they thought scratch was yeah they had a really hard time but I guess anybody else would okay all right so we'll end with that and we'll see you in a month all right scratch on scratch on bye three words that I think of when I think of scratch are programming creativity and fun creativity freedom and teamwork me
