hey everyone greetings from outside of the scratch headquarters on the MIT campus my name is Eric also known as speak vigil on Scratch and I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on scratch welcome to the third episode of the scratch update um so we've been having a lot of snow coming through Boston so we thought it was only appropriate to take you guys outside in the elements with us for this video update just kidding it's really cold out it's way too cold look at my glasses they're all gross I can't feel my fingers yeah yeah so joining you from inside so last week we highlighted Studios and this week we thought we'd highlight the way scratchers help each other in the community Through tutorial projects cool so our first segment love it um so my love it project is by the user theore grits and it's a tutorial project and it's called Fix It pong and a lot of tutorials sort of follow stepbystep instructions um and then you sort of create something um but the Grits sort of switched it up so they shared a project that had had a pong game but it was broken and so the first step was to click the C inside button and the Grits put little hints in the code of how to fix it and what that did is you sort of you learned by fixing the code and seeing it affect the scratch project which I thought was a really sort of uh cool inventive way to come up with a way to teach scratch cool well my tutorial is done by day 30 it's a vector tutorial and day 30 shows this cool uh tool called a reshape tool and you can take any of the vector objects and it shows these dots that you can move around and shape it any way you like it and through like a stepbystep process day 30 shows some cool tricks that you can do like some cool line art tricks to like do different sizes and uh as the says like the best part shading and so it's kind of adding like more Dimension to your vector art which is and using the other editor in scratch yeah those I guess are two examples of tutorials that we found were pretty cool um but there are there are thousands probably thousands of tutorials out there and so that sort of leads us to our next segment which is things to try things to try oop we lost the the ruler's gone there's a lot of wind the snowstorm we should get that after this we're um sorry so things to try um so on the point of having a lot of different tutorials I found a studio I found two Studios actually um that talk that have different uh tutorials in them and so one is called tutorial Madness and there must be there must be at least like 300 tutorials in there it's Madness and so there's there's there's scratch tutorials there's sort of artwork tutorials there's even a Photoshop tutorial in there outside of scratch too yeah and then there's another there's another studio called scratch tutorials that has I think like 20 or 30 sort of scratch specific tutorials that are I think worth checking out yeah so you might go and like learn something new as well so uh if you haven't found uh starter projects in scratch we have these starter projects that are fairly simple but they show different things that you can do with scratch for example video sensing one of my favorite video sensing starter projects is one where you're trying to lift a pizza up and keep it up you can use your hands you can use your head and uh other projects there's some interactive art projects and you can use like your internal mic to do some really cool artwork um one of my other favorites is a dance project so you can show some moves and code with music you saw my moves last week um well what's cool about starter projects is there's actually something in there for everyone even scratchers like I've been around for a while you've been around for a while but it's cool because there's sort of different genres like for instance video sensing is something I didn't know a lot about so I think everyone can learn something from the stter projects yeah cool cool so that brings us to the message we did a drum roll last time I thought that was cool okay our message from the scratch team and we thought we'd build on top of last week's tour of kind of the scratch headquarters there's one that we just kind of had to pass by fairly quickly which is Em's office but inside there's some pretty cool things it looks like a normal office but I think we'll show you some really neat things inside as well cool let's see it welcome to my office I'm Mitch Resnik M res on the scratch website let me show you around my office see over here on the Whiteboard I like to collect some letters that I get about scratch here's one from a proud scratch parent there's a note that I got from a scratch work shop in Italy from one of the kids who was there there's a letter I got just yesterday from a scratcher in Tennessee love getting those letters uh here's some also some different scratch items that people have made there's a great scratch hat that some from Mexico made uh or when I went to Japan they gave me a nice scratch fan actually over here we have a bunch of books that have been written about scratch it's exciting that people around the world are writing books about scratch here's one from Japan here's one from China actually here's a very special book it was made by a former member of the scratch team Tommy Stern and it shows different stages of the development of scratch when we started 10 years ago of how scratch has evolved over the last decade if you come on the table here you have some special treats these are little crafty scratch cats made made with pipe cleaners any hope you enjoyed tour of the office I look forward to seeing you on the scratch website and keep on scratching so that about wraps up our scratch video update cool what should we do now I think we should probably find that ruler to keep this going up so we're going to go back in the snow see you later see you next week oh there it is we found the ruler yes right
