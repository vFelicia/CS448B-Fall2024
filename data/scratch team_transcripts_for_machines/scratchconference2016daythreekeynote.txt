good morning everyone everyone have a good day yesterday well the way I knew it was a good day yesterday is I woke up early this morning and I started reading through the tweets from yesterday and I kept on thinking oh I wish I had seen that oh I wish I had seen that I wish I had seen that and I did that over and over so for me that was an indication of that there's a lot of good things happening and uh and I love the things I saw but I saw there a lot of other great things going on as well and I'll continue to today through today as well uh so it's great to have you here for the last day of the conference and we'll be kicking off with another great keynote session again on the theme of many pasme styles we'll have a special pan panel presentation about creative Computing for all um I want to start by introducing the facilitator and moderator of the panel Karen Brennan of the panel Karen Brennan actually Karen came to the media lab in the fall of 2007 just a couple months after we had launched the scratch software and scratch was already getting out to the world and we were already starting to talk about organizing the first scratch conference and even though Karen was the newest member of the team it quickly became apparent that she was the best person to organize the conference both because of her great organizational skills but also she was so perceptive of so many aspects of of scratch from the Cod in to the community from the kids to the teachers from the technology to the pedagogy so Karen took the lead on the organizing the scratch conference in 2008 and again in 2010 and in 2012 so a lot of the things you've been experiencing over the last few days are building on that framework that Karen helped establish with that first scratch conference and at that first scratch conference I remember one of the best sessions was early in the conference we had a panel of some scratches from around the world and everyone loves seeing the scratch so it was great and then at the end a lot of people said we have to have lots more scratchers at the next conference and we thought about that because of course we love seeing scratchers but Karen said well I'm not sure that's what the conference should be about this conference is mostly about how we can support people in learning scratch but we need something else to really pull scratches together and that led to the birth of scratch day uh and came up with the idea of as much as we love the online community it's great to bring scratches together physically and Karen not only came with the idea but made the first website uh and put up the map where people started adding their own scratch days and every year there have been more and more it's been wonderful to see how scratch day has grown around the world and if if the conference and scratch day weren't enough Karen I think was also frustrated that seeing who it was that was using scratch as it got out in the beginning and people were finding out about it through their parents their relatives it wasn't really reaching as broadly and diversely as as we would like and Karen saw the importance of getting into schools and that's what led her to get started with scratch Ed Community uh and scratched teacher meetups that she started here and has continued as she graduated from here moved on to Harvard Graduate School of Education where she's now a professor there has continued work on these sorts of ideas putting out the creative Computing curriculum gu many of you particip have used that and have participated in the creative Computing online workshop and she to build on those ideas and with today's session on Creative competing for all we'll continue to build on those ideas and go even further so with that I'd like to welcome and hope everyone will join me in thanking Karen Brennan thank you for that embarrassingly long but embarrassingly kind introduction Mitch I actually want to start with two notes of thanks one note of thanks to you Mitch this is and I say this uh unrepentantly this is my favorite Community the scratch conference is phenomenal so it's it's an honor to have been invited to facilitate a keynote today the second note of thanks I want to say a special thank you to saskia to abisola to the scratch team I have special insight into how hard this is to do uh so a huge thank you you to you in making it possible and amazing and I I know that you will sleep very soundly tonight so I hope you enjoy that as well so let's Dive Right In so the topic for today the theme is this big idea of for all and so we're going to sort of press into this lean into this today and so I just want to sort of set it up in this cultural moment so huge announcement here in the United States at the beginning of the year our president President Barack Obama yes yes yes uh announces that CS should be something for all Learners this amazing and I know that we're behind the United States is a little behind other countries I know some of you are thinking like we did that we did that before you did so this is a really powerful idea and I got really obsessed with this idea of computing for all I mean you can quibble over its computer science it's computational thinking I think of Yas Meine CFI and computational participation whatever you want to call it we could have a whole set of conversations around that what we're going to really focus on today is this idea of for all and why am I so obsessed with this idea for all well partly I think it's really easy to say that when we're designing whether we're designing tools or learning experiences we say like this is for everyone but what tends to happen at least it's been in my experience is that it ends up being bracket in some ways some people are included some people are excluded and I wanted to sort of use this keynote not as an opportunity for a lecture or just hearing us talk about it but as a sort of a moment of collective reflection and thinking about are we using that signifier for all and when we're using it what do we mean by it and I wanted to share with you three people who have significantly Advanced my own thinking about what I think about when I think about all Merill Nick and Rihanna and I'm going to ask them to start us off by just introducing themselves a bit sure hello everyone scratch and out there on the internet uh my name is Marl Alper and I'm an assistant professor in the communication studies department at nor Eastern University here in Boston on the other side of the river uh the work that I do uh mainly centers on young people with disabilities and their use of technology and informal spaces my background before I entered Academia was as a Creator research strategist in the children's media industry more broadly so Sesame Workshop Disney Nickelodeon um and so that influences my sort of relationship between researching products that are out there but also how that can inform development great uh good morning everyone uh my name is Nick giobi and I'm a second generation special education teacher my father was a music therapist and my mother was a special education teacher before they both became special education professors so I feel like I've grown up around this work uh I'm entering my 11th year as a special education teacher in the Chicago public schools at Augustus H Burley School in the lake view neighborhood where I've worked with students in first through sixth grade uh I'm the current Chicago Public Schools technology innovator of the year and I think that's due in part that I'm a huge proponent of constructionism particularly for Learners with disabilities I first learned about constructionism through Karen while on sabatical at the Harvard grad school of Ed in 2014 and I also had the opportunity to intern here at llk with Rick Rose uh Ro who is actually doing a session right after this so if you haven't selected one I'd highly recommend it good morning everyone my name is ran GES um at present I'm a digital learning specialist in the Boston public schools and in my role I support teachers with technology integration um but I also bring a personal and a deeply personal perspective of disability I myself heart of hearing today I'm using an interpreter and captioning um I also have a younger brother who has Down syndrome and my mom has been a special teacher for over 30 years so I feel like I understand on multiple levels it doesn't explicitly have to be about disability but disability pervades our life and so I'll be bringing that perspective to today's conversation thank you so much I'm so thrilled that all three of you are here so our first question is what does for all mean to you and I'm going to come I'm going to come back to the three of you I wanted to sort of share an activity that um Willamina perene who works with me at the Ed school we we tweeted this last week from the scratched team and just said like what does for all if we think about Computing for all mean to you and I thought we could make this a little participatory and so we let's do like two minutes of turn and talk so with your neighbor what does for all mean to you I will this is a trick I learned at the edge School rather than try and like I'll cue you when the two minutes are up by just putting my hand up okay so when you see my hand go up we'll come back together so 2 minutes just with your neighbor what do you think about when you're thinking about for all think okay than she he ping for thank you I'm amazed how that is so orderly every time so I wanted to share some of the sort of major thematic clusters that emerged when we took a look at all of the tweets we wanted to just we could have just filled an hour showing all of the tweets that people posted so I encourage you to to check it out but some of the like the major themes that emerged when people thought about all they were thinking about for all abilities for all ages for all disciplines for all genders for all interests for all languages for all Races and ethnicities for all socioeconomic statuses and so with that as the backdrop I then wanted to turn it over to our fabulous panelist what are you thinking about when you're thinking about for all and we'll start with Merill yeah so when I took a look at that list I I saw more of the what I saw some discrete categories and the way I tend to think about this is a little bit more about processes about the why what's behind that concept of for all and so I think about for all as having to do with something social there's something political about it and there's something cultural about it um so something social about it and that inherently has to do with stratification so it has to do with when you mix a couple of those different categories uh or you consider them separately you're going to be creating ingroups and outgroups and so in what ways those get get preferred into different institutions uh there's a political component to it in that who gets to set the terms of their own participation who is involved in the conversations themselves and setting up panels on participation who participates on the panels about participation there's a political component to for all um and then a cultural component um and thinking about accessibility is something that isn't just technical that isn't just about does it work or not work but something cultural um and to just pull it back more you know specifically to something like scratch um as a platform thinking about in what ways uh is cultural participation valued um as something accessible on scratch you think about you know there's the flash platform Flash in many ways has many accessibility issues um and what kinds of content is being created on something like that is that is accessible to all in the scratch community so for all I think of it as having a sort of cultural social and political component great so when I think about for all as a career special education teacher I'm always a bit curious about what for all really means have my students been thought about in that process and uh on Thursday I was inspired by mitches kote to go back and reread uh Gears of my childhood and there was a quote uh from Seymour paper in there that's what you can learn and how you learn depends on the models available to you and so that made me think a lot about a fifth grade student that I worked with last year uh he had to do a science project and what he decided to do it was on the human body he decided to make a scratch game called immune man and immune man was a white blood cell that was designed sort of like PacMan and he had a maze that was the human body and so immune man would Chomp Chom Chomp all the bacteria and it was a great visual way to show what the white blood cells do and I was really Amazed by it and he had the aptitude to do it on his own but I thought about what are the models for him in his life he has a lot of advantages he has a parent who has a computer science background and works in computers uh he goes regularly to coding camps uh so for this uh particular example this project was great and it was hard fun for him but when I look at my students who who don't have those models it wouldn't be hard fun it would be really challenging for them so my call uh to all of you is when thinking about computer science for all uh it actually goes back to what Nicole said yesterday talking about those overlapping opportunities so if we do someday have scratch in McDonald's for students to play with informally I want us to think hard about developing those Technologies so that they include for all as a component because for me computer science for all is both formal and informal education for me when I think about for all I think about um empathy and design so there's a lot of conversations about what exactly does good design look like and I like to ask people that question so for me in my own experience um thinking about planning planning for that variability a huge part of um my Foundation is Universal Design for Learning and so I think a lot about like we're thinking about designing learning experiences we thinking about designing Technologies we have to think about who we're including in that process um people of all abilities everything that was listed up on the screen and we also have to think about empathy because empathy is a huge component there's a lot of talk about social emotional learning and we cannot dismiss the value of empathy and design and I really encourage you anytime you think about planning to consider how you can involve people with disabilities in the process people who have atypical and variable personalities because people with disabilities can be innovators um we need them to be a part of it there are ton of articles that are coming out online there's one on Fast Company design about Microsoft working with all these people with disabilities they've been doing this for years and there's also um different pieces of code that are shown you what it's like for a dyslexic learner when they're navigating a website and when we think about designing websites um just watch someone who's blind tell you how they navigate a website so think about who's involved in this process not afterwards but from the beginning so that's sort of a 10,000 foot view of how you're thinking about for all I asked our panelists um to dig in a bit like what does that look like on the daytoday for you in your work and wanted to illustrate it with some visuals so I'm GNA we're going to pass the Baton down the line so it starts with Merill sure uh so I should take a like one step back before getting into the the visuals and that um so some of the work that I've published takes a a way broader view about Youth and disabilities so I published uh through the MacArthur Foundation a report it's freely available online both in print through it press but also as a free PDF on digital youth with disabilities and thinking about what do we know about outside of just School purely or Rehabilitation settings how are young people with disabilities hanging out messing around geeking out with technology what do we know um and then I have a book coming out at the beginning of next year uh called giving voice mobile communication disability and inequality also through MIT press that takes a kind of sociological view of what's going on in family settings around uh disability and technology and what are the other kind of resources that people draw upon um because it technology doesn't automatically fix you all of society's ills nor does it repair some idea of disability as meaning that something is broken in a person um not at all there's this we need to sort of critically look at how do people uh make things meaningful in their lives um in relation to disability but also in relation to their class background their ethnic background their you know immigration background and whatnot um but another thing that I um I've been wonderful to take part in the interaction design and children community which kind of overlaps in certain ways with the scratch community and uh a little bit back uh a um two colleagues um JP orad uh who's at University of Iowa and shulie glutes who's in Israel um we started thinking about uh the wonderful framework that Mitch and and folks are at MIT had laid out uh in thinking about designing spaces like scratch computational cre tools as having everybody knows low floors wide walls High ceilings right so H thank you you bring me so uh we had just run a workshop uh at the interaction design for children conference and thinking about young people with disabilities and thought about a little twist on it if we thought really concretely about different research we'd been doing around young people on the autism spectrum young people with visual impairments um Young people with uh Speech disorders in in what ways was that model great but it could be better and so we wrote an article that was in ACM interactions that kind of laid out a kind of proposal for what these tools to think of might look like and so to start off one of those was thinking about not just low floors but ones with ramps and I mean that in both very concrete ways and metaphorical ways so also so you have to get into the building if you're running a scratch Workshop uh that's a that's a necessity that's not a a nice to have that's a necessity but also Ram says invitations so what kind of invitations do different kinds of Learners need to approach the floor in the first place um and I say invitations such as other people in stem Fields other people with cs backgrounds who are leading workshops with disabilities themselves um as sort of mentors as people to deliver explicit invitations to take part so thinking about low floors in that capacity thinking about uh wide walls but with frames of Interest so wide walls has to do with you know kids can can explore lots of different kinds of interests in a space any kind of um interest that they have they can they can dip into but not all Learners enjoy that kind of variety that kind of variety and too much Choice can make people stressed out or uh raise anxiety or um just not be what they're into um young people for example on the autism spectrum might be really really uh interested in one specific or one kind of range of interests and it's not to say that a specificity that that's narrow and that that's negative but that might be some somebody's space of comfort so being okay with the it's not every sort of inch of the wall that needs to be covered by every child but that sort of certain spaces that are carved out are okay too in any of these kinds of spaces um thinking about then High ceilings but with tall ladders to get there so what are the kinds of scaffolds that Learners need to work their way up in increasing complexity in any kind of project um and that again can be scaffolding that's baked into a system um whether that's other kinds drawing on udl other kinds of um captioning or other kinds of font choices even what's the kind of what's the different kind of scaffolding that somebody might need to move through a platform um but also social scaffolding as well and then the sort of one additional so a fourth component then is thinking about the corners and thinking about what about Learners and I say in the corners there who are perhaps twice exceptional so gifted uh Learners with disabilities thinking about what are the areas of achievement for them that um that you need we need to maybe think and reinforce a little more what other extra kinds of supports or um uh you know resources might be Marshall to support those Learners who very often there's lots of research on there about those students um or extra risk of being bored or extra risk of U being kind of tuned out if there's not those those kinds of opportunities there so um so for me it's it's kind of a more theoretical visual representation of that's kind of how I think but thinking about how to adapt um these kinds of models for explicitly not just in um a loose way but in explicit way how it fits with disability so this was a model that was published in 2012 yeah how would you extend it reimagine It remix it yeah no that's a that's a great question I think uh it's a thing that came out and so I haven't had a lot of conversations with people about so I'm very interested in afterwards hearing from people about it um because for me the the pushing on of on the walls from the inside of the you know outside comes from conversations with people so I think that um there's a lot of new ways to take it that I definitely haven't considered yet what are your initial reactions responses to it when you see this does this resonate with your work how would you extend it I I think it's lovely and I love how it it seems to really synergize with how I think as a designer for students with disabilities so thinking about having high expectations but scaffold each individual student to what they need to feel successful and to grow having those wide walls and making sure that students have a personal connection to their work and are extremely interested and invested in it it's really fantastic I reinforced what he said um one of the things about spaces like this is that um how much flexibility do we have to actually adapt a space that we're working with um and that is one of the challenges that you know we have I'm not a classroom teacher present um but in the classrooms and I go in and work in there isn't as much flexibility and adaptation possible um but I would love to think about this in the context of our current conversation about redesigning what the schools look like in the future in Boston public schools and in other districts as well um because I think that's enormously important yeah that's great yeah I'd love to have this annotated with specific instances of what it would look like in the classroom and how could we help teachers think about it both in formal learning environments and outside of school that would be amazing okay so maybe we'll transition to udl to Rihanna sure so I was introduced to rihan and by my nextdoor neighbor at hgsc David Rose who's like the father of Universal Design for Learning he's like you have to meet Rihanna and she's amazing she's doing this work in the field so that's how we were introduced yeah yes um so thank you Karen um so actually what brought me to Boston four summers ago was udl um I was an undergrad not an undergrad a graduate student at the um University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and I learned about Universal Design for Learning the first time there um and it made so much sense to me it wasn't something I knew about in theory but in practice and so I said I'm going to cast that's why I have to do my internship and I've been in Boston since so I spent a good year and a half at cast learning about udl and how we can use that in both formal and informal learning spaces so being that I work with teachers what I try to do is uh design those online and Blended learning experiences that demonstrate udl principles and the biggest thing if you are new to Universal Design for Learning is that it's about learner variability by planning from the beginning we can design these flexible learning environments we have to have goals that are set so that we can um design the best space for our Learners and we're going to make mistakes you know I know I've made mistakes but that's how we learn and another thing about udl like if you think about these three different principles um we have to think about how we're taking in information right now um we're taking things in visually and auditorally some people might need some movement so we have to think about representing that information and then we think about expressing like some people want to say something out loud other people need to write it some people need more time to respond and so this is really critical when we think about designing in any kind of environment and then the most critical piece where empathy comes in really is the engagement the why like why should I care how can I Foster authentic learning experiences so I'm always thinking about udl in the work that I do every day so I want to ask you what can you do to plan for variability I hope that by demonstrating some of the work that we've done so far you can think about how you can do that in your own practice if you're not already doing so so this past year um BPS participated in the hour of cod and it was a great event we did a district wide and these are a few images from the hour of code um we have the top two pictures from students at the Horseman's School for the Deaf in Austin and then on the bottom on the bottom right right is another student at The Horseman school for the deatha and the one on the bottom left is a student at the Gardner pilot Academy and all of these are students of color students who may have multiple disabilities um and they were so engaged my personal favorite picture is the one where the the little kid at the top right he just wants to jump into that computer and I just I love it because you know what he's engaged something must be going right on that computer but if it wasn't accessible do you think you would still have the same response so thinking about what that looks like in terms of your design and I absolutely enjoyed participating in the hour of C because it was really transformational for teachers and students they thought about Cod for the first time and others thought about taking the extra step with Cod and then finally um we are having a conversation in Massachusetts and specifically in the Boston Public Schools about the new Massachusetts digital literacy and computer science standards they were recently uh published in June and these are going to be very critical for how we are talking about technology integration in our district um and these are the four strands and I want to highight highlight a couple of them you can read this Computing in society digital tools and collaboration Computing systems and computational thinking now all of these are critical pieces to uh understanding online learning learning understanding how we're thinking about computational thinking and what I absolutely love I have to say this and it gets me excited anytime people even talk about this um tells you that people don't talk about it enough um is that in Computing in society it specifically addresses accessibility IT addresses teaching Learners about accessibility how to build accessible websites how empathy is an important part in fostering Equity so I really encourage you check out these standards and if you're interested in exploring our work we create a lot of videos and professional learning experiences for our teachers and our channel is up there in YouTube we have two separate channels and we talk about the standards there there's a lot of teacher created resources on there as well and all of this is part of our conversation about seos for all and digital literacy more brought me that's beautiful I loved in your second slide this calls think about plan for variability if I want to get started how do I do that what are my first steps I also appreciated that you said like it's okay to make mistakes it's better to try and fail than not to have tried at all but like where where do I get started and what type of supports are available for me I would get started by really looking at the udl guidelines look at the udl guidelines find somebody you know who's passionate about udl someone who's passionate about working on the same issues that you want to work on because they can tell you the things that they've done um that work for them and didn't work for them and I think a big part of this is that you have to be vulnerable and you have to also say like this is going to become a change in my mindset um because it really is critical like you really do have to plan from the beginning to consider all the different components how do how do the kids that the teachers you support get involved in supporting planning for variability how do the kids get involved that's an excellent question I want to have deeper conversations about that this year full transparency last year was my first year in the Boston Public Schools so I'm still learning as I go along and every day is a learning day but that's one of the things that I want to find out more about um one school that I was more involved with Horseman they do so much already around that they I think they one of the things about learner variability in udl is an awareness of your own learning what you need to learn better uh because they always talk about becoming a masterful learner you know Mastery of learning because Master Teachers are Master Learners yes yeah that's beautiful Nick oh okay so for me to show you uh what it look looks like in practice I thought I would transfer you virtually to my class classro in Chicago for a few minutes so as you can see there are some very simple Technologies on display in this room like couches incandescent lighting I'm very intentional about my space so that it's very welcoming more like a coffee shop than a traditional classroom and uh we honor student curiosity and inquiry as part of our curriculum and that's where this project came about uh all of my students in fourth grade get to go for the first time uh to perform through our school's music program at uh Symphony Center downtown which is where the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performs and it's a great experience for them and they had some wonderful questions like where did instruments really come from who designed them in the first place and I thought what a fabulous teachable moment so what I did is I used uh Mitch's learning spiral as a framework for guiding my students through the process of making their own instruments with scratch Makey Makey and lots of cardboard and copper tape so would you like to see what one of my students imagined her instrument to be all right no cheery all right back it up yeah redo and I want to make a flip that that makes cheery sounds like Whimsical music and that's what I want to make and so what we did is we used seesaw as a tool so that students at the end of each working period would record a brief reflection on what they did that day and what's great about seesaw is that it's a twoway street so not only did I have students assigned into critique groups where they would give each other feedback on their design choices they could also asynchronously give each other audio feedback in these messages I blotted out the student names but uh and in the interest of time I'll just tell you what student B said he gave her two great suggestions the first was as she was building a Whimsical flute he wanted her to have a Twizzler as like a read or a mouthpiece so she would put that in her mouth connect it to the ground and then she could play like a real flute uh his other suggestion because he's a fourth grader was that she should cover it with lightning bolts because lightning bolts make everything more awesome true so what I did for create is that I went to scratch and then we played some notes and we messed them and then we um changed the beats and the notes to make it to make it a Whimsical flute and what I love about this is that it actually hearkens back to Thursday's keynote with bubble 103 she used the same words messed around when describing her process in using scratch but this is what really blew me away hello for create I did cheap music for my FL and Mr G put down all the keys that I'm using for my leg make and I put them down in an order that I like them to so a two times so here's a copy of her sheet music that she developed for her madeup instrument and it's fascinating she wanted me to put all the inputs of the Makey Makey up and then she went to the computer and tapped them out because we hadn't finished the physical artifact yet but it's amazing to me that she coded the instrument in scratch and then music itself is sort of like a form of code that follows a logical sequence so it's sort of fascinating how those two come together but here we are on the final day where she got to finally put it all together and play so for play I played with my flet right here that has all the Mickey mickys and so like and it's really cool and I also practice my sheet music that you saw earlier earlier and stuff that I would want to improve at it is add a little bit more sound and so what I love about this and here's a picture of the finished project when we hung it up at the end was that at this point in the process she's no longer working for me she's no longer trying to earn a grade it's about her own passion for the work that she does and I think that's the magic that's in constructionism that and working with her peers of course oh my goodness it's so Beau as a side note I think we have a little time at the end so if you want to come I brought it with me so you can fiddle around with it yourself so I felt incredibly fortunate earlier this year to go visit your classroom in Chicago and I really saw this like profound commitment to planning for variability that rihan was talking about I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what makes it possible for you to do that work in Practice dayto Day in the classroom and I'm also going to ask Marl and Rihanna to comment on what did you notice using sort of your set of lenses in your work what did you see in this example that made this possible so uh well for me I think it's having a very secure and confident administration at my school that trusts the teachers uh we have a long history of developing our own curriculum and so we're given a lot of autonomy to do work with children that we're pass about and so that's what gives me the freedom to get to experiment with things like this just so that you know this was a process they went on the field trip on Monday they finished these instruments on Friday and they spent about 30 minutes each day so total about two to 2 and a half hours of Total work in this project so what did you see what did you see in the example that made this possible I'm really drawn to the um the sort of social scaffolding was provided in Sea and the um both the the opportunity to see to visualize feedback in that way um to have uh an audio component of feedback as opposed to like a Google doc on the side you know Google doc doesn't let you necessarily record your feedback in a in a tidbit you just type a little message uh and so the the platform choices and the options of being able to provide feedback in a way that is natural um you know for her giving you her journaling in a video short video format it's more natural uh perhaps than you know writing a long form or typing in a Google doc or something so for me um the social component and then the tools that had certain affordances for the kinds of sociality that were most natural for for these students also going back to your triplet that you presented at the very beginning about the social cultural and political the politics of the school and that you commented on the power of the administration like it just the entire environment just oozed support in every space and how would that be possible without it I would agree with everything they M said um I just think it's super exciting that they have this opportunity to be able to create in this way I see this student as a leader I want to see her at this year's next year's scratch conference telling us how she did all that yeah it's it's it's phenomenal yeah just to to LY off that yeah that's the thinking about leaders in this space and sort of you know young people um with different abilities being able to then sort of take charge and speak on their own behalf and being able to give feedback to what would make their learning better what would make their their ideas for learning among their peers better um and sort of this same process of you know she seemed incredibly capable of of of expressing those um what worked for her and so being able to uh then be a leader and to in whatever if you know whatever her desires are but I think that it's important to have those opportunities to um to build leadership skills as well as computational creation skills and something that I'd like to add uh something else that made this possible now that I think about it is going back to the classroom this year after a year at hugsy uh something that I've taken with me from the media lab was from Rick Rose's work a very fine look at student process and recording student process and then giving that tool to the students as a way of reflecting on their own process so that's something I'm certainly much more driven in that way now what what are you working on still like what are the puzzles that you're still struggling with mulling over keeping you up at night but hopefully not too much your big questions I'm trying not to make direct eye contact with anyone so they can have a second to think about it that's a question for all three of us it is a question for all three of you your puzzles what are your big puzzles what are you going to work on over the next year let's say so I think for me part of it is uh connecting family the family conversations the classroom conversations the administrative conversations and the ways in which those can be so different um and to add another layer to the sort of clinical um so uh the work I've been doing has focused for a little bit on on um young people with significant speech impairments who use uh Technologies as a way to produce synthetic speech and to communicate which sometimes overlaps with um young people on the autism spectrum and so doing more ethnographic work in homes among kids on the Spectrum and thinking about what are the way the both the challenges that they encounter and the successes that they what they achieve and how families can scaffold this and what resources families have to support that kind of learning but not just what they on their own can do but ways in which there is both a deliberate uh and and not necessarily so deliberate discriminatory practices that happen um in the education system in the US um it can be a real challenge to um to be able to hold on to one's educational rights um considering different kinds of violations that can that can happen pretty regularly and the kind of advocacy that's very often required on behalf of families for their kids to get the kind of differentiated individualized education plan IEP um people are aware of that term um to get those things um carried out into practice so in my work I I discovered a lot of expectations and hopes um especially parents who' maybe just come to this country looking for something better and and significant disappointment and it's partly individual choices but it's also lack of funding in some critical areas so some funding that you know was put towards new iPads that could have really been spent on paying you know educator teachers to come for like an hour and visit a family and understand what's happening there there's a lot of assumptions and a lot of biases that get baked into people's own childhoods and backgrounds I found but um but on on the ground um again think about empathy but do we what money do we put behind empathy do we pay people uh and not ask them on their own unpaid to go do this kind of work um what are we really on a sort of institutional level on a on a polic level funding actively in ways that really matter and I think that how do we fund empathy how do we you know what are the ways that we do that um is a question that's open and I think that's what I think about oh that's great uh and thinking about next steps for me I'm really looking at thinking about Partnerships for doing more work like this outside of the school day in informal settings because if you ask any teacher the one thing that they're always short on is time and so I'm very curious about ways that we can do this kind of work for Learners of all ability levels I often see programs listed as enrichment and for gifted students but I don't see programs that actively seek out uh the variability of these kinds of Learners so that's my big push is push is to go hunting for those kinds of services that's awesome what keeps me awake at night is is uh how I can help teach and actively act in designing a more inclusive World um I don't necessarily work with students every day I've said this already but I work with teachers and I like to think everyone in this room is a lifelong learner we're all learning that's why we're here so I would love to work more on designing professional learning opportunities that are inclusive of all Learners I mean scratchers of all ages all abilities right so having these professional opportunities like at camps and um conferences like this I mean this conference has been awesome I have accessibility here but this is actually a rarity um unfortunately so I want to see more opportunities for us to design those um professional learning experiences for all of our teachers because not everyone is comfortable with disclosure I have a lifetime of advocacy um I have a mom and a grandma who were big huge Advocates and that's made a difference I mean Mar talked about the parents the families I mean every single parent in my experience who has a child with a disability experiences some level of guilt you like that that's never going to go away even my Mom feels that way so but you can get um past the guilt by still you know acting upon it some people never do um but I think it's our job to like design those spaces so when people come in they can have it ready you know it's already accessible for them because they may not even know they need it either um so that's my big thing that keeps me off every day yeah small small matter and actually a core sort of one of the core tenants of udl that I love so much is sort of like what's good for one is good for all that everyone can benefit from it and so when you create these accessible spaces you aren't just thinking about this one person everyone can benefit from which is so beautiful so the last question I'm going to ask is purely selfish but I hope everyone else benefits from it as well sort of advice you've given me so much guidance and given me new ways of seeing the world and thinking about things so what's an idea about for all that you hope people asking for a friend uh will take away from this session uh so I think if there's one word uh and you can tweet this out you can you know spread it far and wide the word intersectionality you can Google it you can research it um it it starts explicitly uh it's a term that GRE grew out of uh black feminist spaces uh and thinking about in what what ways especially this is started off kind of in the legal space but what are ways in talking about women's rights and legal rights very often excluded women of color and an active uh reassertion of uh of power imbalances and thinking about who gets to define the terms of participation and so explicitly intersectionality that no no child with a disability you know is not only the same because of the same you cost diagnosis can be different um but also just thinking about the intersections of class and so the resources and just getting a diagnosis is itself a very uh tricky thing to get if you don't know where to go or who to ask um so intersectionality and thinking about to basically we say about for all but without thinking about intersectionality you inherently are privileging some and so an active push back on on it's a it's always a work in progress for all is always a a moving Target but we can better aim on the Target by having a sort of intersectional component in mind where we're thinking about all of the different differences that individuals represent so uh the thing that I want to leave you with is a couple of Statistics first so right now uh roughly 133% % of students in schools receive special education services so that's 6 and A5 million Learners that's one every one out of every seven to eight uh students so as you go forward and work with students um look at the ratios of the kids that you're working with are do those line up with the actual population and I'd invite you to go and seek out special education students uh and if you're having trouble doing so uh Mimi said it best yesterday she said uh teachers are great Wranglers and so make a friend with a special education teacher and get them to funnel students to you you won't regret it I think they both said it beautifully I feel like most of what I've been saying today is what I want to leave you with I want to leave you with the urgency of having to design right now don't be ret with anything things plan it from the start um and it will be be um hard but be open about how it's hard and be willing to learn always thank you thank you so much please join me in thanking our amazing panelist and with that I will turn it over to miss sasia thank you I also want to thank Rihanna and Nick and Merill and Karen who's been a huge inspiration to me for a long time so could we do another round of applause ah okay um so just like the other days I'm going to quickly go over our schedule

going to uh serve lunch out there but then we invite you to come back to this room with your lunch to join us for our closing session our closing wrapup session will you're have an opportunity for Q&A with the scratch team um also a few last reminders we encourage you to continue connecting online with our hashtag we'd love seeing your photos and your tweets we Ed a lot of them in the slideshow yesterday so keep them coming um and also just a reminder that we have a Facebook group that a lot of people have been using to connect with each other throughout the conference so this is yours to use now and continuing after the conference as well and we'll send out this link too so you don't need to furiously write it down um just to note that there is a lost and found and we have a few items in there so see us at the purple desk if you're missing anything particularly sunglasses or a single sock um and if you're already thinking about post lunch and and your post lunch plans uh I welcome you to take your badge to the museum of science or the MIT Museum where you have free entry just remember to show your badge um and also on our conference website under the plan tab there are a few suggestions for things to do around Cambridge around Boston um there are other wonderful museums available so check that out our hashtag [Laughter] again um and then a final thank you to our sponsors so I encourage you to uh check out something that you haven't checked out before today and have an awesome time and enjoy your last day at scratch at MIT thanks
