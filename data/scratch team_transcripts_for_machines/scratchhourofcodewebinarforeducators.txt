oh yeah oh we like I realize well I realize every why hi everyone this is working yeah this is good do you wanna introduce yourself and yeah hi everybody I'm Zoe from the scratch team I helped make learning resources here my name is Eric also known as people visually on scratch and I also help with learning resources and happy to use webinar we're gonna talk about power of code so welcome to educators who are about to be doing an hour of code coming up here to two weeks yeah no we we it's a week away yes so what what can the educators today look for it we are gonna start by sort of talking a bit about the three new tutorials we have for an hour of code this year on scratch and then we are going to open it up to you all for questions yeah and sort of share about what people are doing for their hour of codes as well yeah I do they share it so you might notice the fancy graphic at the bottom alright so a really important link is this link right here so throughout the webinar there's gonna be a bunch of important links that you might want to bookmark or save for later also you can kind of follow along because that it's a kind of an outline of what it is we'll talk about today in the webinar so it's bitly slash scratch hoc web so for all the educators this is kind of like your go to the holy grail of Google box for you so check that out follow along as we talk about all the things as we say a link you don't have to remember it there and then so hi everyone in the chat we invite you to ask hour of code questions and yeah just write well will probably answer most of the question is active like the latter half of the hour super excited to see people from Egypt Brazil yeah just all over yeah welcome everybody cool so let's let's dig in so we have a graphic here oh yeah the old fashioned kind what is our codes how our code started I think in 20 2013 through initiative code.org and the idea was to sort of introduce kids to sort of an introductory onehour session with coding and obviously over the years it's gotten bigger and bigger and so now you can kind of host an hour of code a bed using code that org or using scratch or using a variety of other programming languages and we today are going to share with you some of the new activities we have for a scratch yeah so uh I think we want to talk just a little bit about the philosophy and the things we think about when we're making resources yes yeah yeah um you know we we like it we try to make resources that are as generative as possible um so that like things that will spark kids going in as many learners going in as many different directions yeah that's possible um you know it's where people can really add their own ideas maybe we really like making things that are kind of thematic so some kind of a theme but it can be sort of based on interests so maybe if a kid likes storytelling or a learner likes storytelling yeah animations or something yeah so very very generative yeah so really bringing your own ideas and sort of around themes so thematic those stories so and and that's I think important context because per hour of code what you can sort of expect sort of your session to look like is to have a lot of sort of tinkering and exploring with these themes and hopefully at the end of your session your activity that all the projects will look different and you kind of have a sense of sort of again that expression that comes with coding and so I think with these activities you'll find there's a lot of ways in which kids can really make these their own yeah yeah yeah um so I guess what scratch resources can one use for a week there was a graphic for that lesson in Africa well there's one more thing we wanted to talk to about the philosophy and read and resources well today when we're sharing you sharing with you these activities they're also sort of in this structure that we'll talk more about it which is the imagine create share structure I could imagine create share which is at the beginning spending some time to imagine brainstorm around the theme and then you create so it's been some of the vocals I'm creating and sharing at the end and so as as we present these resources be thinking of that in your mind so without further ado drumroll dodododo what scratch resources do we have for our codes that's a good question so we have three new resources and maybe I can actually if you go to the homepage of scratch as of today so watch this fancy draft because if I examine so as of today when you visit the scratch website and you're not logged in you can see the three new our code activities we have so we promise though and I promise in the next hour to go through each of these activities so we thought it would be nice to first we want to just kind of dive into one of these activities to show you how it is you might run it in your classroom yeah okay so should we go to the scratch editor yeah let's just do it we're also mindful that there may be our people here who haven't used scratch too much so I think we want to just start out by saying we want to make sure this explanation is kind of giving you that if you've never touched the website before so if you've never touch scratch before if you go and click the Create button that'll take you into the scratch editor that you make a new project but you make a new project and then you'll see frontandcenter here this is the tutorials window so right now when you're not logged in you'll see a getting started video and a getting started tutorial this is great just to sort of get your feet wet so let's actually minimize that for now and then in the top laughs we hit plus a few times so you'll see a tutorials button so Zoey and I are going to click that and then you will see this is a list of all the activities that you have our tutorials library yes okay so let's click yeah no more Arnold okay and yeah well you hit the plus down at the bottom gets me to meet the code that we good so later on you'll see while we're clicking that last button but let's talk a bit about this let's talk about what it is we're looking at right now yeah so right here are our tutorials we'll start with a video that's sort of therefore like letting people like imagine sort of generate ideas so this one the the theme of this tutorial is imagine a world and magining a world where anything is possible so the video sort of gives some wacky scenarios and and cool different peptides ideas of worlds you could imagine and and just to sort of give learners ideas and then if you click the green arrow that's to the right of the video just right there yeah then it's the videos followed by a bunch of images that sort of step by step have a simple blocks of scratch code you can put together to get your project going on that beam yeah and so I think we're talking about the imagined section so the first half to imagine I think that video that you saw gives you like a good sense is very inspirational and what it is you can try it you can have a globe that flies a zebra that's playing the saxophone whatever it is you want and then yeah then to sort of get into the coding here with the different steps should we kind of just create just somebody follow this so just to give you a sense of who I'm gonna try to zoom out and make sure this works nice so for instance we when we're developing a tutorial want to make sure that we have like a really low floor easy tour to get started so what you have here in the first couple of steps of this tutorial is essentially just pulling out a very simple of that block really fundamental to scratch is the wind green flag is clicked that's something that you think you really want learners that your students to kind of understand it like this is a triggering event here yeah and then something that's super super generative like what is more generative than say blocks yeah all right so you can add whatever you want and that's another thing too with these tutorials is sort of selfdirected and like there should be invitations for you to sort of add whatever it is you want and so you'll see that here with the the next step which is choose any backdrop so automatically with choosing a backdrop you have you have a huge variety so you're already sort of introducing that sort of customization and so maybe a big clinical city yeah I think we put that step so early in this tutorial because we wanted to like let people really imagine their world right away like what are these backdrops feels like a world so so we are so so we just picked that the kind of colorful city Zoe what what what's right should we choose oh man let's go into there I know bananas are pretty great alright so and this kind of gets that it's like yeah it can be wacky it can't be fun and so we can kind of we can now kind of go through the rest of the tutorial and we can see here there's gonna be a number of different sort of code block stacks that kind of give you really powerful simple concept so for this one this is using a key to trigger the changing of a book position super easy stack you'll see choosing another spray move right and left with arrow keys I mean this is maybe like this is one of the most popular things in spice what about most viewed tutorials yeah so go behind the curtain a little bit like exactly yeah so like already it's like well imagine a world where let's imagine a world where bananas can move back and forth let's do that really quick so again I would like to be in that world yeah so we can have it move to the right let's go ahead and duplicate the stack goal at minus sign so there you have we already have the walking banana banana in the street and so the idea is as as you progress through this tutorial you're you're introduced to I think like the most basic but most powerful concepts in scratch or some of those powerful concepts in scratch and so I I cannot say enough about how this tutorial i think is great for folks that are just getting started and if you're thinking about what they introduce i think this has this has a lot yeah and i think this one we really tried to design this one to be but beginner friendly and really like yeah as like blocks that are pretty easy to snap together and they go wrong yeah i mean this is one of my new favorite tutorials that we have and I'm not just saying I mean it's great alright so let's come back and and what else do we want to talk about this Oh doesn't matter well I think we could also talk a bit about this tutorial because is wonderful as bananas walking through the streets are you also could think about sort of blending this into maybe a lesson that you're doing maybe about like social justice or climate change or something that meaningful yeah you take the idea imagine a world it could be just openly imagine whatever world whatever whatever wacky things you want could also do imagine a world where people weren't hungry or you know yeah and again this is like a great jumping off plane you know even if they veered off the tutorial after 10 minutes you'd still have like those basic fundamental building blocks to scratch and so I really love imagine a world and I can't wait to see it's relatively new yeah so we can't talk about imagined world the whole time yeah we're gonna do that and then that's our little deep dive into that one I think we won't yeah go as deep into the other two but uh we will still without further ado next up what's that it's cartoon so I'd recognize this character I think Oh could that be from Cartoon Network's craigger the crease yes so this one just dominant it's Jessica Cartoon Network fans or just fans oh yeah awesome thing yeah we collaborated with Cartoon Network to run this neck tutorial which is how would you describe it it is also designed to be pretty beginner friendly with like blocks that lets start a new project with blocks that you know you can combine together a lot of you know a lot of like come you know easy too easy to put together blocks but that's sort of the theme of this one actually get in yeah and but with the theme of this one being sort of animating a cartoon character yeah and so the video for this one also gives a little like and you probably yeah also something important so when we when you when you select code a cartoon yeah it brings up a new tab oh yeah that's not important to note yeah so let's to run that again let's run that again so if you're in a blank project and you selected coded cartoon you'll notice it creates a new tab and then in that tab it okay to start a project that has these characters this one we wanted like crank of the Creek characters there for you already the Cody if you want yeah okay yeah um so yes it gets a little bit of inspiration with the different types of ways you could animate a character um and annually could be one of these Craig of the Creek characters could also just be a character from scratch or when they drop and you know it walks through the first first few things you can do and then after the video and it's got lots of sort of code stacks that yeah that you can build to animate the different characters got them growing and shrinking and I think one of them jumps and yeah it's great it's kind of like bringing your cast of characters to life kind of giving them superpowers giving them personalities making them do things it's it's really great for it kind of like the the wind sprite click kind of interactions again yeah a whole bunch of characters and you click on them and they do different things yeah a lot of a lot of pretty simple a lot of again very like kind of simple but powerful scripts I'm also really excited about this one also one thing to note which is important at the end it's kind of like this invitation to sort of add your own characters to sort of make sure that it's not just Cartoon Network like that's not bringing in you saw your own drawings or whatever characters you think should be air magic yeah so that one I would say that that one and imagined world are both I that's also a bit I'm pretty yeah it's designed to be pretty beginnerfriendly yeah yeah I think so again yeah a lot of those short but powerful scripts so let's talk about last but certainly not least talking tales okay so talking tales it's a cool title oh yeah so tell me more about talking tales so talking tales uh is a little bit more probably for perhaps a better level for someone who's a bit more comfortable with stretch um or maybe has done a few tutorials already it uses um the texttospeech exact you we have to scratch which lets you is down our extensions button in the bottom left corner of the editor so yes so maybe before we jump into sort of looking at the tutorial it's important to note yeah this is using an extension and for folks that aren't familiar with extensions extensions allow you to connect to software extensions yeah by translation yep stuff where you don't need to have any additional equipment for it to work you have the computer that you have been excreme' also hardware and extensions yes so like some micro bits and things like that so if you wanted to add an extension what you do is you go to the lower left here that little square but yeah zoom in you okay and you'll see the the list of extensions here this one's gonna use texttospeech and see that adds some new blocks zoom in can we zoom in on the blocks oh come on computer well I'll pull in a boxes yeah there you go speak hello we're not saying we're not fancy enough to have this work would we click it here so it'll say hello if you were in this room with that would you work here it's like a robot voice hello mmm yes hello yes that's the idea and then you can set the tone of the voice altos a bit higher squeak is really really high giant a bit lower so anyways yeah so that's the kind of the basic sort of scratch extensions texttospeech yeah okay yes sites and and so this tutorial is sort of about using those texttospeech blocks where you can make characters talk aloud to take your characters on an adventure and you sort of go to different backdrops and they say different things in the different places yeah and so it's it's using texttospeech and I think a really unique way which is and also event block so as though we mentioned a lot of the scripts are triggered when you click a sprite and move to the next backdrop so you've got this we have this when backdrop switches to black in scratch yeah so it uses a lot of like when backdrop switches to underwater that as an example the dinosaur could like around as if it's swimming yeah and so if we go back to the video actually there's there's a beautiful example of this so we're watching it in the video here the first thing is we're in the city and then the ghost is clicked very sorry she's click and then it goes to space and so that's what you're doing you're kind of stepping through these different scenes with your two characters or more than one can take more than two characters and that's triggering these things that are said and done I think that's what sort of I was making us think of this is something for people who are a little bit more comfortable with scratch is that sort of it's getting into okay I want to have this these backdrops and have these things happen sort of the event triggering yeah so we like when when the backdrop is switched to Jurassic which is this backdrop the dinosaur says there's no place like home when it's switched to spotlight you see the dinosaur will say check out these moves and then dance so that day was so cute yeah there's really I personally I'm obviously a bit more familiar with scratch and I found I found this to be like so generative and fun because it's kind of like you never know what's gonna happen next and you can trade many stories like mini dancing with a dinosaur I mean II like shopping spree with a dinosaur I don't know and it really just it's fun to like share out it's really looking to have your friends the projects we were making is we were like designing it and making the samples we're just like laughing and to be honest like wind background switches when backdrops switches it has like a half of that block is like underused it's like really a super light awesome way to a project okay so please do send us your questions at our code questions yeah so we've talked again about the three new activities which you can access on the home page of scratch is that all that can be done for hour of code why no it's not there are also more scratch resource wait there's more do we have a scientist oh you bet we do so of course we've created three new activities for hour of code and if you go on the our code so I quote that org or hour of code calm I didn't have it I don't know the exactly you know what I bet does Google document the document yes the Bentley document yeah has it in there yeah we create you'll find these three activities and some ones from previous years however big however however you should do whatever you want and we have the plenty of other activities that would be perfectly suited for your hour of code experience yeah so you take a little trip to ideas page the ideas page so let's go back we'll get to Fantagraphics so one of the the most powerful buttons on the scratch website is the ideas button here and then a half fire so we'll go to the ideas page and if we scroll down the ideas page we'll see a little mosaic here of a number of different activities this one makes familiar yeah but we have on this page nine different activities to choose from I would say Anna made a name make a chase game and imagine a world these are like especially good for beginners I think we roughly have the sort of the the top row is especially good for beginners kind of yeah basically yeah so there's more than meets the eye though so especially especially for folks that are looking for some more support materials for running an activity with scratch if you click an activity so for instance will click will click animate a name it's gonna pop up this modal I'll zoom in in in this you'll see a number of resources you'll three three different resources this blue button is gonna take you to the editor and it's gonna open the tutorial and that's kind of exactly what we were doing the first three examples yeah so that's the in editor tutorial the coding cards oh my god so the coding card she won't explain these yeah I love the coding card so much the coding cards are uh they're they're sort of like a print version of what the tutorial is um where they have lots of sort of code blocks steps yet you can go through um and it's so you know it'll on the front each card it'll sort of sort of at least roll up just a tiny bit okay yeah that a so it'll show you the like is is called color clicker until you click a letter to make it change color and then on the back of that card if you just scroll down yeah it shows you the code to do it which is just changing the color effect so so anyway they've got lots of activities almost of different themes creating a story making a virtual pet making a pong game yeah it's great to have these available they're a bit like more verbose there's like some more explanatory things I'm like where things are sorry Association I would highly recommend printouts and copies I love sometimes nice to like have a physical to be going by yeah yeah okay so that was one really awesome one of the links that we have let's go back okay so he also has here's this other one it's called an educator guide and the educator guide is going to help support you in running the in this case a onehour workshop yeah of course it's not at all prescriptive that says it has to be one hour I think this is just a framework that helps support you and thinking about how it is you might chunk however much time you have and so right up top we kind of give the suggestion again we talked about this earlier the imagine creates share sort of framework which is spend the first 10 minutes or what I think would be like maybe 10% of the time gathering to come up with ideas around the theme and then spend the bulk of the time creating and then you spend time at the end really important sharing and reflected yeah and so even if you just even if this was just the extent of a guide I think that's a good reminder but there's more which is this is sort of a guide that helps support you in each of those steps so you have how to prepare and then this is the imagine section so for instance in the imagine section you might have a warm act activity where everyone says their name and then everyone in the group packs out the shape of the first letter of their name you might also show the video which shows some really kind of inspiring examples or creating there's some great facilitation tips here and for sharing there's great tips on sharing like questions you might ask like what was the hardest part if you had more time what would you add change and so this is this is like a really really great resource to have to look at through yourself and again try to make it fit for however much time you have but I really do think the imagine create share is there's a framework that's really worth sort of investigating and I think you do get like really great results from that yeah yeah so so if we zoom back out and we look at this again so there's nine there's right now nine activities that have like this complete set of educator guide cards it's toriel and so imagine the world is the only one of the three this year that has that complete set but again think about how it is you can come up with your own icebreaker and I think the share section you can look at any educator guide and match that to whatever it is you're going totally and it's so inspiring to see how educators will remix these things and change them and yeah and make them fit their own contacts yeah yeah oh and talk about the logistics sure that's probably important right there's logistics oh so so much just to think about is like well not just like like should students have accounts why would a student want an account on to ash if you want to work online and save the work online they'll need help don't need to have accounts that that is an important thing and and and I think related to that is you probably want an easy way to generate these accounts and so what I what we suggest doing and there's a link in this guy for educator accounts so we can probably just actually walk you we can show you where it is you get those yeah so an educator account is gonna let you easily create a of scratch accounts associated with your account I know there is so much good stuff in the scratch footer so right yes is for educators down there in the footer a lot of good stuff yep so we'll click that yeah it does feel sad to like blow through all this content but but this one's problem so you can request a teacher account and 24 or 48 hours we'll approve it and there's a great FAQ here if we really have questions it helps walk you through the features of a educator account and I think probably like maybe most importantly to share it today is that you can upload a CSV that has usernames and passwords for your for your class you can also quickly manually create accounts it's like I think it's there nice nice to have it also allows you to more like easily share to Studios plate again check out the fat yeah definitely suggest doing that so there's also another link in the footer let's talk about this let's come back to us so we just talked about being online we understand sometimes the internet goes that there's a giant snow so we're having like yeah your net the internet can drop out of here in any moment there's a huge session about yet so just in case as a contingency plan it might be nice to have the offline editor also some schools would prefer to be offline yeah and so we got you covered let's let's let's show you how we have you covered so we will go back to our browser where can they find so right down here under support you've got this download button download ok and here you can select your OS we have just within the last month a released scratch for a Chrome OS for an Android so scratch works on Chrome but Chromebooks now as its own app which means you can connect to extensions yeah super exciting anyway YUM yes you select your your OS and then it's got all the stuff you need for down for downloading scratch offline yeah and again that's like probably snap that's like an app and you can connect to extensions yeah super cool this was also scratch 3 is like a kind of a single download thing you need to download Adobe AIR and you like that it's super simple couldn't hurt to have it on a flash drive just in case or installed on Chromebooks or your students laptops yeah so you got coverage they're also important the tutorials are also on yes the tutorials are on the offline editor so you don't have to worry about them not being accessible yeah I think we ready to open it up for sharing the the chat has been going like crazy right now so we have a number of socialism I think we also have a llk life on kindergarten scratch team or lily here who is offscreen okay who has been has been helping out in the chat we also have rueful Natalie in the other room and Keo the chat so for this this this this halfhour the last half hour this session we want to exclusively focus on what questions you might have about our code and scratch resources and also we want to highlight a few sort of few stories of how other educators do want to be using hour of code this year how their amazing traps our code yeah yeah are there any questions Lily that you think we should we should try to address yeah question really good how would you say that what do you think say to start but also definitely want to open it up to the chat so answer yeah yeah yes that okay so here's what we wanted to do we are not the sage on the stage we don't have all the answers and in fact we would like to hear from the entire chat this be like a hybrid Twitter chat YouTube thing that is a fantastic question so if you also have suggestions we could use the entire brain trust of who is here right now to help support that so the question is how how do you support folks at different challenge levels um as you put your answers in the chat um I think that we try to design our tutorial our tutorials to be easy to do them in kind of mix them up in any order so and unlike you could take one and then go to two other ones like they're sort of all compatible so you could start with imagine a world and maybe one kid spends the whole time on imagine the world but if you really reinforce to other learners like you could do okay you sort of they say oh I'm done with this one you could say oh well do you want to make it talk and then you can do the talking tails or create animations that talk which also uses the same texttospeech extension as that so you could sort of like uh because you can then combine whatever you would do in the talking tails one could be combined with an imagining world one so I think that I think that's a strategy that I have when we do workshops is to try to encourage that like the tutorials can kind of be like puzzle pieces that can go in any order yeah the tutorials are good jumpingoff points and there's certainly tutorials that have concepts are a bit more challenging yep yep yeah so I would I would say that's that's one way to address it if you have the the means to have a hardware extension like a micro bit or a we do kit I think connecting any of these reefs or any of these activities with a connection to a physical world device is a way to sort of peek a lot of sort of interests and folks that maybe want to kind of get off of the screen a little bit and take their project in a direction of bringing into the physical world I've found a lot of success in that and then I often mention the online community because I think it's a wonderful space filled with a lot of inspirational projects that of course you can see in side and so I would not shy away from inviting folks to sort of check out the online community and think about remix in or building off of another project again and and I if you if you're not familiar with the online community again you can play a project and you can see inside and then if you're logged in you can remix and build on that so I do think there's ways in which you can sort of peek kids interest by showing them inspirational projects in the online community and have them build off of something that is maybe a bit more challenging yeah yeah and focusing the chatter mentioning that like the coding cards have helped with student learners at different levels know that the you know letting them choose their own coding card set to work through it in their own direction one thing also that I should note is it is funny because sometimes that might one way to frame that question is like the complexity of the code becomes maybe like uninteresting whoa like it becomes like too simple okay I'm just like right it's it's like I want I wanna do something more complex and it's like a very code specific very Co specific like want but also like thinking about the audio and the armory there's so many like wonderful artwork tutorials in the online community if you search like vector art tutorials if you search like yeah so so searching for tutorials in the online community whether that's art or like sound is a great thing but also if someone wants to like add gravity or add a high score leaderboard to be honest like if you type in high score tutorial on the scratch website there's going to be hundreds of tutorials that can help so so the search bar is really an important thing yeah to get a good question and like getting that motivation we're like the the there's there's you know making a slideshow project that maybe it's the code is is just switching to the next slide if they're really if you're really motivated to make that slideshow yeah any stage of challenge that was a really good question yeah eh at first time and as well so what question do we have next for us in the chat such a good question will the live chat please please yeah while we ruminate I have won you that one great mic as I see create a story could be a cool one because you could sort of brainstorm a story or brainstorm a story together maybe like before you really with a pencil and paper or just just talking and then with the help of the older kids yeah start making the story it could be yeah there's um there's probably some games too so let me let me jump to let me jump back to our editor here let's make a new project there's a few games where I can see where you might want to make it like a twoplayer game and that would be fun so like for instance chase game chase game the the idea behind the chase game sorry I'm gonna get like super specific into an example I don't know if this is exactly what you should do but for instance chase game is you have a character that chases an object and you are sort of shown in this tutorial to move a character with right arrow keys and left arrow keys but of course you could add a second character and instead of having the right arrow go right you could have the W key and you can have the Q key go left and so you could have instead of just one character and you're gonna have two people two characters either competitively or collaboratively playing a game like this and it would only kind of just take a little bit of hacking of this idea because again this is kind of a single player one sprite chases that's right but I could totally see kind of some cool stuff of having both kids on the keyboard controlling characters totally that could be cool pong game is totally talking the same thing partly the front page of the coding cards of pong game actually show and even the beginning of the tutorial show just a hint that you could easily make it declare anyway they yeah I've had success with animated name actually cuz it doesn't have to be a name it could be it could be something I shared interest or something or it could be something silly because a very beginner activity at a younger audience yeah but actually no no I think a lot of these work like telling a story it's fun to come up with a story together yeah yeah and I had to talk to a educator um history this year who had an awesome project where third graders and eighth graders would would work on would make a monster creature together but the third graders would decide what the head would be in the body and the arms and then the eighth graders would Cody and scratch and bring back to the third graders like the Ephesian so there's also stuff yeah that's a good question thanks yeah thank you so much we don't have any robots back to Jesus so I you know the there's there's the you don't have a robotics webinar or like robotics like Lego robotics or anything on hoc activities this year we do though on the on the extension pages for us Lego so our our extensions we have like scratchy or scratch for instance not dry like you gotyou slash we do oh it's scratch.mit.edu slash in this case we do yeah and so here it's got um a little video that actually we made yeah that um it shows a bunch of like sort of projects you can do what we do and then it shows the basics that face might be familiar uh shows um some starter projects to get started in the stuff so not hoc it's specific for here but there is stuff and the same thing if you instead it in the URL bar in it instead of we do you did Eevee three um or boost I'm pretty sure they have the same one yeah and so again this is like the inspiration you can see here so these starter projects we have a set of three and each of the starter projects will kind of highlight one kind of feature of the robotics kid or whatever hardware device so like play the play basketball you're using the distance sensor for music you're using the buttons on the ev3 and for space tacos tilting you're using or like turning the motor direction yeah to like guide your thing and so it kind of like I get introduces in a very fun generative way different parts so yeah the landing page it's like /eb three and / redo I do wish and I'm not sure this is the case there's an easier way to get to the landing it's a shame that right now it's sorta you have to just know they're there they there they're either link to them from the extensions library if you back at this button this square button in the bottom left any hardware extension if you click on it to add it this is Lego boost how you can it help but gosh that would be it would be great yeah that's a good question um yeah and then I think in terms of more webinars this is the only hoc yeah are people like in it I mean we should probably do more webinars it's fine yeah so I don't know it's probably not between now and yeah it would now now but this will also be available as a video on demand later at this same link yeah um and and we want to do more webinars in the future yeah but in the meantime I want you to play we can talk about languages and scratch this comes up a lot yeah yeah yeah so actually I think not everyone may know this uh but you can change the light scratches translated into over 60 languages and if you click on that globe icon up in the top yes right there um then and then the menu small but you can change the language and then all of the blocks will change the yeah which is pretty great uh the tutorials the videos have captions which are translated into a lot of languages and I think that most of the tutorials have translated into at least thirty languages and then and then up for a you know after the videos there are those images those images that have that different like sort of steps um and in the all of our all of those things having oh that all of our tutorials are in Spanish and so for this hour of code all of our our code activities are available are fully available in Spanish English in Spanish but and more languages coming to come in tutorial translations yeah I think that's kind of fun so Zoey and I and others on the resources team we're trying to think through exactly like how it is we can easily create localized look like translated versions of all of our resources and it's like a laborintensive manual process yeah currently though we have a wonderful shout out huge shot up to the translators who are translating scratch so many different languages it would not be those languages they use size 60 because people have love scratch and want to come back really hard and like every time we make a piece of text on the website and then change the wording slightly they go in and I think the work is it's a good question I would wreck this isn't like oh my gosh there's not options it's just I would like to phone a friend in the chat I don't we have some scratch steamers out here that I'm sure have good ideas as well what comes to mind for you Zoey I think that anime a name you can go you can you can like I think there's that moment where it clicks and you make something do something that was sounded vague but in animate a name it's like you click on a letter and it changes color and I think inanimate name it's so quick it's such a short and and and you could do even like animate a word you could all animate the same word if you've got 30 minutes or you know but but um you know it's like two blocks and and then you've got something happening so I I think that that's that could be an option yeah I I've done workshops that are 30 minutes my introduction is scratch I don't know if I've ever told you this a week my introduction distract was a like 30 minute workshop and what happened was it was it was a very basic introduction to react like a very getting started like here's scratch we actually I'll throw this out there I'm sorry we haven't mentioned this yet I'm gonna go back we have a brilliant I think getting started video Oh which I shouldn't say that cuz we made it brilliant but absolutely brilliant this arrogance okay yeah the getting started has a one minute video that essentially says like what is scratch how do blocks work how do you run blocks how do you trigger the blocks what are sprites and it's like in one minute you can like automatically feel like a bit more comfortable about like what it is you might be doing so again this is like oh you can connect blocks you can then run them and then introduced this idea of there's events so if you want to start your code you drag out an event block and then you know we say you can also rearrange the blocks you can also then toss out the blocks you can add multiple sprites and code them and so like in a minute in literally a minute you get like a good kind of bearing of like okay what is scratch and so I think I can't emphasize enough just giving it the lay of the land is important also I think explaining to folks that it's totally okay to experiment and scratch is about tinkering yeah and if you want to do a tutorial animated names of crazy Christian in the chat one of our friends who helps us make all awesome resources um working our resources team with us is saying said that um for a 30 minute lesson she'll also do group coding so like yes together yes one project and things another awesome idea yeah that could be yeah that's interesting yeah also group together like that 39 introduction what was I was with someone and and it was it had a lot yeah because you're kind of going through it with someone you can bounce ideas off of yeah and I guess thinking about the imagine program share it would still be nice to have like a short imagine section where you show what is possible with scratch yeah and so X on the home page of the scratch website just the home page blog out there's a about scratch video that is like I think I'm minute long which shows you different scratch projects because that's another important thing it's like what the heck is scratch like why would I want to like what is like Cody why am I not inspiration that buyin yeah like I can make games that can make stories Anika make animations so like hit him hit him with a hole inspiration yeah yeah that's great question yeah and I think like a very good to remember that like the time constraints but I don't know how it goes to if you're honest wit yeah if you're on Twitter you should like totally make sure to tweet that that scratch would be in super inches a see how it goes yeah yeah okay we got 12 minutes I'm sure we've got more questions yeah you're more questions and so wondering both like maybe enemy this isn't the time for the places to go can find out more about scratch yeah um the the there is a scratch FAQ which has answers to some of those there's also on the about scratch page that Eric mentioned I think it has some stats about users and stuff yeah I know so yeah we can answer quickly just some of these yeah so so so specifically there's this statistics page where you can see how many people you could via the footer technical questions if there's a specific question you could always use contact us mmm so you can send a message where is contact us contact us down here in the footer contact us have you ask a question if you really want to like dig into like the code that scratch is built on it's all open source so if you google scratch github I'm sure you can find a repository that will have a bunch of documentation and all the all the stuff that you want guys so I would 528 point you there yeah there's one thing about and generally speaking about scratch is them oh it's all open space yeah the website I mean a website there's probably things on the website that's clearly yeah and like the scratch 3 was built on like full requests and like code from other not only within the scratch team but like contributors so like yeah yeah you know there's a lot of folks on better scratch users that contribute to be actively yeah I see caffeinated mention with scratch scratch wiki yeah yeah somebody's asking about being able to create code in scratch that the that that would be super super cool and yeah I am going to write that down sweetie well I was also say so um we had a master student here yeah Tina who is looking at coding for the folks that I've like visual impairments and she was digging into like what could a coding platform might be like if you had to use your voice only and so there's actually a scratch would you update if he wants to scratch video updates which is a video blog series that's on YouTube I think the most recent episode Tina cohosted with me and she actually talked the last three minutes about her work that she was doing around that but we're always thinking about how to sort of make scratch more accessible and I think even in 2020 that's something that like we're really really focused on the s3 is launched we covered them all just kidding how there's so there's so many um so maybe that maybe we can plug the educator page again so let's go back again we will scoot down all this good stuff is who would have thought we spend so much time in the footer but here we are the educators page front and center on the educator page is a wonderful resource called scratch and practice I would describe scratch and practice as well was a monthly every month we'd have a new theme that would help you bring scratch into your practice so the previous themes we had were getting started with scratch connecting to the curriculum peer learning projects with the purpose and then for each of these themes we'd have content that would help you with this so for instance in February we had getting started with scratch we had a workshop so we talked about a workshop that you might want to lead animated character Mitch talked to kind of a high level of sort of how he used sort of the importance of giving kids started with scratch experimenting exploring expressing themselves natalie dove a bit deeper to talk about sort of exploration and an app explanation and then we had educators just like you kind of sharing thoughts on how to get started with scratch and so there's a lot of great themes here to dig into we're not doing a month anymore yeah but there's more important or more cordially I guess you could say yeah so scratch in practice I believe that's also in the handydandy link and that you that you see in the title on the webinar so that's one that comes to mind there here we've got alternative links to the educator guides also the creative computing curriculum guide yeah which is awesome yeah this is how you might plan sort of coding activities introduce scratch and like really just amazing ways over and over several weeks it's it's a it's it's free fantastic guide that's also good yeah so and and there's probably other resources that we sorry it's highly suggest checking out the educator page cool all right we got a couple more minutes seven more minutes let's go back so that's a good question so you might see something if you search hour of code on Twitter you'll see hash of our and you see a lot of kids that hold those certificates like I complete an arc and so we don't scratch does not have those certificates so that's the kind of sharing that you can see at the end is hopefully is like a an exhibition of the projects so so we don't have anything no badges or any certificates for completing it but again hopefully you have time to sort of show off again these projects that hopefully are whoa that's a great question yeah I think we're really we really want to think about that and like how we can support deeper learning yeah it's just some stuff we've been talking about and like how how to really like support all these pathways friendly the first getting started tutorial and I think we were thinking a lot about like what shapes they could take how can we involve more like starter projects I think when we ask people about how they got into making bigger bigger projects a lot of people talk about starter projects yep so I think we probably prioritized we prioritize creating a lot of entrylevel generative thematic tutorials to start with yeah because there's some carryover from 2.0 it's a 3.0 I keep missing on my handi yeah from 2.0 to 3.0 there's some tutorials that came over then we added a bunch of new tutorials and now that we've built out I think a nice sort of library of tutorials or that's one of the things I'm most excited about in 2020 is thinking about how it is we get into sort of these more advanced stuff it's not completely obvious how did you do that I think there's a lot that we can learn from how it's kind of happening on YouTube I think there's a learn from starter projects from whoever asked that question if you have suggestions like you should totally write to us I almost wanted to say like you could put in the chat like where you'd want an advanced tutorial to live like yeah or do you want to paint like when you want to find in this like in the tutorials library we want it to be a scratch project a scratch studio yeah or like a thing online and like and what kind of stuff you want to be like we will listen to all of that might my suspicion is my intuition says it might not take the same form as the tutorial where you step by step starting from a blank slate yeah it might be more starter project he base where you explain the code in the concepts or it might be wrong form I don't know so it's not that we forgotten that we don't it's nothing thank using up today it's a great question and we want to do more of it yeah something we're really excited about yeah there hasn't been a mighty one but I wonder yeah so scratch days are held all around the world I think especially in May but all year round and also in the footer I think it's also in the footer this is less of an HSE webinar and more but the footer so yeah is we have one at MIT have where like folks can come are all around for like as long as MIT is here scratch they will be here I just like it's like that's that is yeah there's the saying I don't know yeah it's got so it's gonna rise in the morning and scratch they will be at MIT today it's like things that are obviously gonna happen yeah so yes so scratch day at MIT I don't actually know the date for this year tonight May 9th May night May night 2010 you you heard of here first that's great that's that's wonderful yes I yeah and if folks are interested in scratch they I figure that's the first time you've heard about this scratch day thing it's as exciting as it sounds its global network where people come together to host to host events to celebrate scratch and the people who scratch it yeah folks will make like scratch projects folks make like cookies with the scratch pad on them folks will make like a scratch projects and new and weird ways and so you can see here there's a lot and not too many these other parallel universes there's thousands and then you can kind of host that explains this this is man resources talking about resource design this is great it's tough you through imagine planning and sort of organizing and inviting it's like everything you need to run a scratch day and poster scratch day yeah two minutes I would point you to that would point you to the downloads page so it's a good question on the download Pam on the scratch day so yeah it takes you away took me away I would point you to the downloads page that should hopefully give you requirements it does give requirements of sort of what sort of operating system you need if if you have a specific question and it's not answered in the FAQ or on this page you can send us a message to contact us but but I think to pop up a level like it's available on Windows Mac and Chrome OS offline so maybe that dish that's covering a lot of bases yeah and the oh one thing to note is with Chrome OS and Android is an Android tablets yeah so I learned this that if it's important distinction so Android could mean phone and tablets phone and tablets but this version of scratch works on android tablet devices not Android phones yeah so are they 30 ready 30 so I I guess we want to thank you all for hanging out contributing to answering the questions thank you so much it's been so fun we've been thinking about this webinar for a long time so we hope you enjoyed it yeah and maybe we should post more of these and we hope you have a wonderful wonderful hour of code and again thank you everyone in the chat who is answering questions and thanks for all the folks out there helping with the chat Thank You Lily the ideas coming of tutorials you'd like to see yeah we want to make uh stuff you you you all have such good ideas you wanna make them cool okay well I guess till next time yes we hope you have a good night and we'll see you later scratch on scratch on bye
