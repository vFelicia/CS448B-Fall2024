hi I'm Mitch Resnick professor of learning research here at the MIT Media Lab think of a traditional kindergarten kids are playfully creating things in collaboration with one another you know making castles out of wooden blocks or pictures with finger pain they're learning about the creative process and developing as creative thinkers now unfortunately if you walk into most elementary schools or middle schools or high schools you see something very different often kids are sitting in desks listening to lectures filling out worksheets the focus is on delivering information or delivering instruction this approach is even seeping down into kindergarten where kids are looking at phonics flashcards or filling out math worksheets in short kindergarten is becoming more like the rest of school in my research group here at the Media Lab we're trying to do exactly the opposite we want to make the rest of school in fact the rest of life more like kindergarten so we call our group the lifelong kindergarten group
