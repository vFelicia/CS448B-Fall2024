so I've been drawing basically since preschool when I liked how to hold a crayon I'm interested in all sorts of art I started using scratch when I was 11 I remember the very very first project I ever made was a virtual puppy game but I never thought that I could do like the coding part like I thought like oh well maybe I can do art but after wait till I'm grown up and like hired someone to code it for me but then I was like hey I can actually do this myself and I kind of slowly built up my skills from exploring the program and other people's programs and eventually I made a project lemonade time where you can kind of walk around and collect items I got a lot of comments from people and I thought that that was just the coolest thing and wanted to keep making more making an art with scratch is different because I can collaborate with other people make something interactive that other people can use because I'll use it for school project sometimes when people see it usually they're the first reaction was like wow that's so cool I wish I could do that but it's like you can just like try it you
