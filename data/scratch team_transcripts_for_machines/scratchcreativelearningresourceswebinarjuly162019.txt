sorry hello hi everybody I'm Kristen I'm Zoey and I'm Eric we're the learning part of the Learning Resources team at scratch and we're excited to be chatting with you all live today we're going to be talking about learning resources so if you're someone who's working a using scratch as an educator and you need ideas or just want to know what kinds of resources are out there there's a lot and they can sometimes be hard to find so we're gonna kind of give you an overview of some things and then dive a little bit deeper and the first half of this webinar then and the second half will actually be doing a live Q&A so hold on one second because there might be some transitions between when we go from our slide show to other things there with us is actually at least my first yeah my first webinar are you sure I think the links yes we have some links to screen share with yes but so as Kayla mentioned we really want to invite everyone to be sharing questions over the over the coming hour and so we have a number of ways in which you can do that one way and I think people are already doing this is there's a chat on YouTube live on the right side feel free to drop in your questions there you can start asking questions now yeah yeah we we have people from Genoa hi also some smiley heart emoji you can also just send yeah yeah yeah yeah well which is the scratch team introduce yourself so YouTube live chat is one way to ask questions another way is on Twitter you have a Twitter account you can tweet us your questions using hashtag scratch and practice again that's hashtag scratch and practice and then if you really like Google Forms I like Google Forms we have a Google Form where you can type in your question so to get to the Google Form you go to bitly slash your scratch questions again that's bitly slash your scratch questions so there's a lot of different ways to ask questions and we really really really really hope that you do ask question people are asking if they will have access to the slides oh yeah right yeah Wow yes so there is a link to this slideshow and it's another bitly link so it's bit dot ly / actually I think it's it's slash actually we'll put it in the chat we'll put the link in the vibe we got a whole hour to figure that it'll be good it's in our yeah it's in slack so if someone wants to drop that in there it's a slack yeah thanks so much okay so I'm Kristin and I'm gonna give you a brief overview of like what some of the main resources on our website are but so don't worry these are vast descriptions we're gonna come back to these and kind of dive in deeper so some of the main resources on earth that you can get from our website are the tutorials library and we'll kind of walk you through that in a bit the coding cards which you can buy online or you can download and print that are a resource we've got a lot of positive feedback on from educators they come in sets that help kids create their own unique projects based on games or telling stories or creating animations or dances or music so they're just a bunch of really amazing theme based activities that kids can really make their own then we also have educator guides which are designed for educators who are running potentially a onehour workshop and it kind of gives you the kind of imagine create share structure that we often use in our workshops to kind of help you get set up and start running a scratch workshop of your own the philosophy behind all the resources that we create is kind of low floors wide walls high ceilings and what that really means is there's a low entry point so anyone can get up and running and start making something creative that they're passionate about right away and we've really tried to support that with the Learning Resources by creating things that help people dive right in and get them making projects they're excited about why walls means that you can explore like a broad range of interests and passions so no matter who you are or what you're interested in you can find a way to connect to scratch and make projects that you're passionate about high ceiling is is that there's room to grow so as you grow scratch can grow with you so I know we've heard a lot of scratchers talking about like they go back and look at their first project and they can't believe that the progress that they've made so they might come in and do a really kind of simple introductory project and then they build and create you know way more complex things as they continue learning yes so the next thing I'm going to go over is tutorials and I'm feel free other people in the room to chime in at any time yeah so now I'm actually gonna go to the scratch website so when you come to scratch on your own and you're not logged in this is what it will look like in order to get to the tutorials you actually have to open the scratch editor so I'm gonna click create to open the scratch editor since I'm not logged in it automatically opens this getting started tutorial for me right away and what's nice about this is if you're you know entering the scratch editor for the first time as a new scratch user there's this kind of welcome experience for you where it kind of shows you a brief intro into scratch and even if you click through these arrows which are sometimes a little bit hard to see you get actually a set of cards that shows you the you know how to create your first simple block stack and even what the blocks do um the other nice thing we just recently added this you can actually shrink the tutorials window so if you're working on something and you're you know adding your own blocks here and coding you can shrink it and move it around and then you can expand it again which is is new and we're super excited about it and we hope it's really helpful especially for people working on Chromebooks and other smaller devices but I'm actually gonna go ahead and enter the tutorials library so our tutorials library is full of kind of a broad range of different kinds of activities that kids can engage in so we have everything from creating animations making music making all different kinds of games if I scroll down here you can see there's also some a little bit towards the bottom things that maybe focus on specific skills like how to hide and show a character or how to use costumes to create a sprite animation so I can pick any one of these and I'm gonna choose kind of a classic scratch tutorial animate a name and you'll see that when I click play I'm gonna mute this that you can kind of there's a quick quick inspiration video that each tutorial starts with that shows you the broad range of things that you can create you know in scratch or with this tutorial and then you can dive into these cards that walk you through step by step you know how to add your first write and what kind of block staff we're gonna add to create that animation so this is kind of the basic structure for all of our tutorials and I'm going to kind of quickly go through these when you get to the end of the tutorial you'll see there are options of other things you might want to do so all the scratch tutorials have been designed to be kind of modular and that means that you might start your own project you know creating an animation and that animation could become a story it could become a game it could become any kind of hybrid of any of the kinds of different tutorials in our library and you can keep adding to your project using different tutorials so you could pick from one of these two or you could actually go back into the tutorials library and by clicking see more I don't know you guys have anything else to add yeah they're very generate I think you got it's a very generative so so the hope is and I think this happens in the tutorials you can really truly add your own ideas your own sprites you can add your own sounds you sort of make it your own yes um hi I like super exciting to see people from Venezuela Belarus Ukraine Canada and Boston in the chat welcome everyone it's really exciting um so if you go I just gonna show you a little bit of the I DEA's page on scratch uh that yeah so if you you know what where you can get a lot of like ideas for scratch projects which is just if you are on the scratch website and then go up here to ideas first it's gonna have a link to you know this will take you to the tutorials library that Kristin just showed you um and then you know this just links right to the getting started tutorial here we have a lot of our activities with and sorted so you have all the resources for one activity together so you know if you click on animate a name you have this link which will take you to that tutorial video there's also this link that will take you to the coding cards um right here um that like and if you haven't seen our coding cards uh you know it'll be a set of cards like around a theme uh with a bunch of cards in a set each card will have some sort of thing you can do in scratch this one is changing the color of a letter and then on the back of the card it shows you like the simple code to do it so anyway so the cards end or the video tutorial could both be used for animator name this also has a link to the educator guide for animator name which is just some extra info for educators on how to run a workshop or a lesson with this activity so we have that for quite a few of our of our tutorials then got this link that'll take you to the all of the scratch quoting cards like all of the decks we have I think we have eleven on here right now and they're translated into there I know that they're translated into Spanish and we're getting in more and more translations which is awesome thank you our community of translators this link will take you to the scratch starter projects page which I find a really a fun way of getting getting people like started with a project might make sense start a project but so like it'll tend to be like they're just the bare bones of something like this one is a maze starter project and it just has the absolute minimum of a maze but it you know you can you can remix it or anyone can remix it to make their own project and get it go in any directions so I find the starter projects are really helpful like if you have a student who's wants to know what to do next or if you a student you know getting students started in making a larger project so yeah that's uh that's about the ideas page we also one of the really cool new things in scratch three is that we have a lot more extension supported which you can see all the extensions if you go to the scratch editor so create and then if you go yeah I'm just gonna close this video um if you go down here to this bottom button in the bottom left then and that is the add an extension button so if you click on it there's all these different blocks you can add to scratch these ones up top are software extensions so they're built into just about most computers like you've got music and pen that should work on any machine video sensing you just need a webcam and then here we have our hardware extensions that you need some kind of hardware to connect to so we have make it a key micro bit on a bunch of Lego ones and veneer so if you just you know you can click on one and then it'll help you connect to that device and it adds these you know I had an item micro bit so it'll add these new blocks that let you code with a micro bit also if when you're going to this add an extension button and if you when you click on this when you click on an extension to add it this help button for all of our hardware extensions if you click on it will take you to a landing page that has a lots of information about requirements for work doing that hardware extension how to get it connected installing scratch link with which helps will you need to connect to any hardware um and then down here it has some very initial things to try and then they have three starter projects that we've designed for getting people started so yeah that uh that'll do it for extensions and here right here in the slides we have okay oh yeah totally I'll I'll show one more time how to get to get to the landing pages or the yeah yeah yeah yeah so totally um so you know again down your bottom left is the add an extension and then any of these Hardware extensions so my cravat if I just click on it in the extensions library then this menu pops up and it's this button that says help will take you to that landing page also scratch.mit.edu slash uh whatever the name is a bit of ice so slash my crabbit slash boost / 83 / lee news flash for ringer will be all the links here those one super tiny tip with extensions is so we mentioned downloading um scratch link you also want to make sure you have that running anytime you want to use that extension I think that's something that people forget sometimes oh that's oh yes I wanna make tiny tip cool Wow so that was a lot of that was a lot of good information right there so I want to remind again people to be asking questions in the chat I'm gonna I'm gonna try to add to this conversation by sharing a bit about the scratch online community and I see there's some scratchers to some folks in the only community in the chat right now and I want to share with folks there's so many fun things to engage with in the online community I wanted to highlight just three of them so I'm we're screen sharing now so I could just jump to one of these tabs right so let's go back so the nice thing is you just go to scratch stop and we see that edu and so this is the online community we can stay logged out as we cruise through this so I want to show you here on the home page if you scroll down you'll see we have a couple rows here we have future projects featured studios project curated by but then we have this road called the scratch design studio and for folks that are familiar scratch design studios are essentially thematic studios that change every month or two and they're around certain themes so for instance puzzles the puzzle these are projects around puzzles we've had like in the year 3000 design a restaurant and every theme is inviting to the scratchers of various sort of levels of expertise or familiarity with scratch and so this is a wonderful opportunity if you have a classroom with kids and you're thinking about how you want to engage with the online community this is I think a good first step it's a fun theme and then what you can do is when you create a project you can sort of leave a comment here with the project ID and then one of the curators will add it to the studio and this is like a really really living breathing wonderful place to sort of get your feet wet in the community and even if you're kind of looking for inspiration even if you happen in the community a long time I think the scratch design studio is definitely one of the first places that I would suggest checking out another one that's a resource is the next to them going to talk about rather you can find via the search bar so one thing that I love about scratchers is that they want to help each other so if they learned something they want to sort of share that learning and one way in which you see this happening is literally just type in a tutorial in the search bar I spell that right I'm live in front of a bunch of people I think I did I spell it right thank thank God so yeah if you type tutorial you can see a number of different tutorials that are scratch elated you know what's even cooler I'm not even cooler what's also cool is there's a lot of artists in the the scratch community that want to share about drawing and vector bitmap and so it's gonna be a nice mix of sort of coding related art related tutorials sometimes what's also cool is this is gonna bring us the projects related to tutorials but also you can check out studios and these are sort of curated spaces of tutorials so I could check out those so for instance maybe you type an art tutorial and see what comes up or platform tutorial things like that I think it's safe to say there are tens of thousands of tutorials out there made by scratchers so if you're looking for some help on a project or want some new ideas check those out one more sort of resource that I want to show folks that I get really excited about kind of like a broken record it's this concept of an engine project so let me bring this up I spelled engine right ok good I'm so nervous to misspell in front of you all so the idea behind an engine project is this will have like the fundamental code that might power project so if you're thinking about how you want to add gravity to your project or let's type in the platform engine let's see what this brings up this will give you sort of the barebones code and usually it's commented and that can help you get sort of a running start if you will and build off that project so I just clicked here I researched platforming engine because we might want to work on a platformer game and so we see here we can go back and forth let's see inside really quick so here we go we can see the code and it's nicely commented for us so we get a sense of how it was built so you might backpack you might throw this code in your backpack and that's that gives you a nice sort of jumpingoff point for your project and there are thousands of engines out here on scratch so pretty much if you type in the search bar blank engine you might find one and also if if if you're feeling like you have a concept or an idea that you want to share gosh I would really I really you know suggest making one of these yourself and sharing them with commenting um you can see they're very popular and I always do appreciate when I'm trying to figure out something if I search online on scratch and find an engine to help me so those are just three things in the scratch online community if you weren't aware of and I just think it's a really special place because of those scratches that are in there so yeah alright so the next thing we're gonna chat about is scratch desktop um so if you're working in a place where you don't have great internet access or maybe you have no internet access at all you can still use scratch um so if you go to scratch.mit.edu slash download um which I'm gonna go there right now it's everything you need to figure out which version of scratch desktop will work on your machines and kind of gets you started setting up scratch and we also have scratch 2.0 which educators ask us sometimes because they're used to using or they created you know resources 42.0 I mean I also even have one point for so if you are using older computers that are not compatible with 3.0 we also have these other two options down here one thing that's really great about scratch desktop is that you can still access the whole library of tutorials so if you still want to use those resources with your students and you don't have access to the Internet you can download a scratch desktop and you can still access all those things one major tip for kind of classroom management that I think is a good thing to know about scratch desktop is you'll have to you know file if you go into savor creating something and it ends up in the same place on scratch desktop you'll actually need to save the UM to your computer so you'll have to save files just like you would if you were using any other kind of offline piece of software to the desktop and then load them in with scratch desktop when you're working on them again so that's kind of I would say them the most major difference of just using scratch to create projects offline cool so do we want to talk a bit more about ways to sort of engage in some of these resources maybe connect with educators yes so I'll kick it off I can start with sip so scratching practice for those that aren't familiar it's sort of a monthly series that we've been working on here at the scratch team to sort of highlight educator strategies and educator voices around using scratch in your practice so I think we actually have a tab with scratch with sip open do we not yes nice present they all look like scratch but anyway so we started when we start this February yes so we started in February so each each month has a different theme and within a theme we have a bunch of resources to check out so let's check out some of the past themes really quick so we'll go view all themes we can see getting started was in February curriculum connection so how you connect scratch to your curriculum many pass many styles that's thinking about ways to introduce scratch and and then we have peer learning so the collaboration that happens in scratch so I'm gonna quickly kind of search through one of these pages so let's jump to curriculum connections this is going to show you what one month looks like we have here sort of an actionable thing to do so this is a workshop it's really great at sort of connecting to the curriculum create a story you know there's so many different ways that you can be using the the creative story activity and so I could click go to activity guy that sort of helps you understand how you would implement this in your classroom well usually I'm a minute with Mitch which is a video where Mitch talks at a high level about sort of the theme and then we have Natalie's notes which sort of digs in a bit deeper and shares some examples so for instance in this Natalie's notes you're gonna you're gonna see actual examples of kids using scratch in a variety of different classes you see here the water cycle is one one one project that we're highlighting here and then we usually have a featured resource or two as well so this is time to scratch add and then super important we want to highlight those educator voices and so we'll have at the bottom of every month educators talking about how it is they're you know using scratch as it relates to that month so in this case we have Gulen Miguel talking about a wonderful project about making their own botanical garden and and Justin talking about projects around sort of youth interests and sort of what they are passionate about and so this is just kind of our we're trying to go this route we're four months in we've got a lot of cool content to cruise through so again if you go to the SIPP website and do you all themes you can check out the different months and this homepage now looks a little bit different because we're in the summer so we sort of step back and for three months we actually spent that time going to a number of conferences trying to meet with educators but SIPP will start up again in September am i right mmm yeah and everyone's like they're doing it looks like it yeah so we're still working through what September looks like for SIPP September and Beyond looks like per said but I think there's also a survey I was supposed to pitch a survey right yes that's true yes okay link to there's a link on the next slide to a survey which is important and I'm gonna toss it to someone else to explain it oh okay so yeah the the SIPP survey is kind of I think so scratching practice we're just trying to figure out like you know we're really focused on empowering educators who are using scratch in their classroom and we'd like to learn more about what we could do to best support you all and I don't know Lily do you have anything to add to that yeah so it's super helpful to kind of if you do fill it out we really do appreciate it and one thing I can say about the the scratch team overall is like all the feedback that we get we really do care about and everybody here puts a lot of work into making sure that we're you know serving scratch users and educators who are using scratch can I have one more point to scratch and practice sure I'm gonna go back a slide because we're talking about scratch in practice um I forgot to mention that every month we also tend to have a Twitter chat a Twitter chat wherein you can sort of ask questions about that theme and resurfacing content and even this webinar is sort of scratching practice related this is part of our summer of scratch scratching practice so shout out to the Twitter chats okay yeah one of their resources that I wanted to share with you all that's not a part of a scratch website is learning Creative Learning and learning creating learning is a free six week course that you can take focus on creative learning so it's not necessarily scratch focus though there might be some scratch involved but it's an interactive course online where you'll participate in weekly video meetings forums discussions handson activities and exchange facilitation ideas with other educators from around the world and actually one of the coolest things obviously you know you can click through and see all the different parts of this course and the website but one of the things that gets me super excited is when you scroll down and you see the map of who's participating and learning Creative Learning and it really is you know a global community of people focused on creative learning and sharing ideas so definitely if you're working on finding new ways to bring creativity into your classroom learning Creative Learning is a wonderful resource and I think it's definitely something that can be used ham and ham a scratch all right all right yeah I think that brings yeah you and I we like show our amazing the wall the whole time yeah we're still here yeah so I think now we've been pretty I'm actually impressed by the fact that it is 1228 and you're just about hitting the halfway mark and we're ready to start answering I hope we have a halfhour of questions I hope people are asking questions yeah yeah sweet okay yeah just a little further okay wait so we should start answering questions right yeah you're reading the question thanks for your questions in the chat and the Google Form again if you want to share questions we're on twitter at hashtag expression practice or there's a Google form that we shared I don't know if we actually might have a slide we know we can we can share that again or you can just type right in the chat why don't I get started off with a question about students who are already like familiar with scratch a bit and they're looking to go beyond what they've already tried good I'm sure yeah I'm happy to take that one I'm not quite sure what to do with the computer so you can see all of us yeah but yeah I'm one of the things I think and Eric really highlighted this nicely while he was chatting it is a really great way to kind of support like if you have a bunch of different learners in your classroom and everybody's kind of working at their own pace a great way to support kids is by you know connecting them with the scratch community and if that's not something you're quite ready to do in your classroom you don't feel like you've explored enough on your own one of the things you can do is either find a project or you know projects a collection of projects or a studio that relates to what that students interested in or the kind of project they're trying to create and share that with them because it's a great way for them to kind of you know remix another person's project and see how it works and that sort of thing I think a lot of scratchers once they get into dive into scratch are really learning from each other which i think is what's so wonderful right yeah so much I see another question actually from from me thinking about if there will be a scratch conference this year and next year this year the scratch conference is in in Cambridge UK hosted by Raspberry Pi um the next year it will be again in Cambridge here oh my god yeah rich Massachusetts here at MIT yes need to be announced oh yeah we also have details on the scratching practice website about the UK conference and some other events that are upcoming there's also a conference in Chile yes sure as well I believe yeah time travel backs again so you can make that happen I feel like we need a turntable yeah so actually and I might screen share again for this so hold on one second will I awkwardly do that no it's important so there's a creative curriculum computing guide and I'm gonna I have that window open so I'm gonna go here we go so there's an entire website developed by scratch Edie who also produces a lot of content and we work with them quite a bit around scratch and they actually have a really wonderful creative computing curriculum which is available entirely on their website for free you can download it as a PDF or you can go through it on their website so it contains everything from things that might get you kind of started or more like a kind of conceptual aspect of you know how you might introduce this to students to even things that support you in the classroom like here's a reflection page page that helps students reflect on their work so it has a lot of really great resource to support educators who are using scratch in their classroom so that's definitely kind of where I would start if I was using scratch in my classroom right now that's a creative creative computing curriculum yeah I know I always yes yes yes I'm cool and actually should I show what we're up here did we want to show a link to something else earlier that we did oh the slides I just know how you could submit questions oh yeah I mean so here's yeah here's where you can see I'll leave that up her for a minute oh yeah great so we also were getting a lot of questions about teacher accounts in terms of like great suggestions for changes and questions about the status of that proposed scratch and scratch jr. know I can also yeah I think that um we are we really appreciate we so right where we're right now just like in a gathering feedback mode necessary saying that it's just great to hear what what you would like in teacher accounts like but and basically if you could just put all of your thoughts and feedback into this surgery um that would be great because then we will get them and the whole team will so yeah thank you so much to those of you who've already been sending in suggestions both in the Google forum or in the chat or in this survey um some other things actually I guess I can answer this quickly there's people asking about scratch for Chromebooks and scratch for Raspberry Pi and we're excited the team is actively working on both of those and so there will be a version on Chromebooks later this year and raspberry PI's is also in progress for later this year so stay tuned for some announcements about that another question that came in early it was how can you embed scratch projects can you embed scratch projects on a webpage message back to so can you invent scratch projects on your website the answer is yes so let me let me let me show you so let's go scratch website so let's say the breath of the wild project we want to embed so we'll go to the project page and then it's two clicks so what you'll do is you will one so I go to project page then you hear it says copy link so I will click that copy link and then you'll see this is the link to the project and this is the embed code so the embed it's an iframe so you just drop it on your web page and it will be there yeah whoo so again copy link can get you that it's the same embed code is 2.0 nothing nothing nothing new there I got so many questions thank you we can make this work sure well not stop broadcast oh my oh my god the scratchcards online the same cards that you have available purchase how do you get the cards yeah so the scratchcards online and the ones that are available for purchase are the same content you can download a PDF on our website on the ideas page for free but if you want a nice printed box of cards you can also order them from Amazon no starch press prints them for us and we're super excited to see them out in the world so yeah they are the same content wise yeah let's really look so like tips its ideas page and then it's scrolling down BAM download PDF right beside it so that PDF of all the cards and actually there's a bonus set of cards in the back well yes PDF if you download it that is at least it should be so care yes for video sensing so we actually have a deck of cards for video sensing that is not so our the deck of cards you buy online doesn't have any extensions really in it um so yeah we have this deck of cards that we developed for video sensing and we figured we'd include those in the PDF so that's kind of like a little surprise extra for anyone who downloads that PDF but wait there's more yeah cool yeah this is a tough one someone asked about like grading and assessment of student projects if there are supports for that or ways that you think about that the one thing that I've heard I've just been traveling this month to a couple of conferences talking to teachers about uh how they use scratch and this came up a bunch and a couple of teachers that felt really confident about it would sort of create rubrics with students at the beginning like talk about how about making a conversation with students like what do you think is would be okay we're making a game in this class what should I have the components okay yeah sure you can have a win condition and maybe a game over and like you know some kind of user input and so build obviously that's just for games but building the what the students think would make up a good strategy because you know we all know that like the number of blocks or all these things like they never quite describe like how much work this didn't put in and stuff so I think that you know and I think it would be a really good idea for a scratching practice theme is like assessment or you know yeah like how did I do it yeah I think that's a big thing that's really tough to tackle in one question and it is oftentimes it's really specific to the group of students you're working with and the kind of content that you're covering you know I used to be a high school art teacher and I would spend like hours making rubrics just kind of carefully designing them to be openended enough for my students to be able to explore but then to also support me when I was trying to be fair and assessing their work um one thing I know and this is kind of just a smaller thing is like whenever we run a workshop kind of how we gauge our own success is that we look at the diversity of student projects and we know that if we created a truly openended project and supports students exploring that there none of their projects look the same at they were for the most part they've all kind of explored and felt free to express their own ideas and I think when we kind of feel like we really need to do more work on a resource that we're creating is when we see a bunch of projects that all look the same so for us that's kind of like I think a bar that we set for ourselves I mean it's more about self assessment yeah but I do think that you know we place a strong emphasis on creativity and I think definitely for scratch and practice can assess of assessing creative learning is a big challenge and I think a bigger question that we want to address their screens and related to thinking about that there's pee asking about like professional development opportunities workshops like we mentioned the conference like what kinds of opportunities are there for teachers who are like getting started with scratch I'm wanting to share with others and find out more well one that comes to mind is the scratch ed meetups so if folks aren't familiar with scratch scratch heads out of Harvard and they're focused on sort of connecting with educators who are using scratch and they're getting brilliant work I don't know maybe the pulp the website really quick scratch n meetups so um scratch that has a number of resources online like the creative computing curriculum guide but they also have the support a network of what they call scratch ed meetups which are events that are organized by educators around the world wherein they invite educators to share periodically together what it is they're working on and there's a couple dozen that are like active happening around the world Keio is now showing you sort of like the listing here and in fact if you want to start a scratch ed meetup that is something that is totally possible and I believe the scratch ed website has information on how you would do that they have this really brilliant kit that this is like wonderful book that explains sort of all the aspects of a scratch I'd meet up and there's really nothing like going to a meetup to talk with educators nearby to see what they're working on it's a really really wonderful experience so I think of PD and scratch that comes to mind is at least one thing that you all should really really know about yeah and I think that we are looking into exploring the idea of doing more PD and yeah I think if should we like people are interested in that should they say in survey hairlike yeah yeah I mean definitely if you if you have anything or specific opinions or feelings about what you would most need from the scratch team as far as professional development that is definitely something that we're thinking about in the future how we can support more educators and definitely scratching practice is also part of that and that's something that launched in February that we're still building and learning about how we can best support educators through things like sip and also how we can support people in person as well yeah hopefully we'll do Mario sorry please I was totally doing more webinars and sit I mean supposed also like something that like we're really trying to focus in on yeah someone's asking about scratch on little phones what the opportunities are for that I can do anything also in it yeah that's me that's a good question so but one way is you can outplay it scratch project on mobile phones so that's good feel free to chime in folks in the room Qi I do think there's a lot of thinking of like how it is you'd have like a good experience coding I'm you're known yeah and so I don't want to give a nonanswer but I do think it's something that we're looking into but I think there's just a lot to think about there and so the fact that you can now at least sort of engage with the scratch project and watch on your mobile phone is a good step in the right direction but yeah yeah yeah I guess there are no guns we got more they answer than that yeah them creating creating project experience on mobile like isn't I'd rather go to my computer but tablet yeah yeah it would be incorrect to say we're not thinking about it but I don't have we don't have any like nightly inside information on when if that's gonna it's becoming it's really something on their mind yeah but it's one of the exciting things about 3.00 is that you can use it across news any time it's great it's wonderful to watch that funny something fun yeah yeah and the end and the yeah just there's lots of really cool mobile projects and like uhmm Oh someone's asking what can we look for with scratch in the hour of code this year yeah so we are I you know I don't know how much of this I can reveal but we have been working with Cartoon Network again this year to create a project for hour of code we're super excited about it they're you know I just we're sharing resources back and forth and they're creating some awesome sprites for fur scratch so you'll be able to edit and interact with those sprites and scratch yeah I don't know how much more we want to say we're so working on it and though I do kind of like the idea of people being surprised yeah yeah we're we're still working on it we're excited about it so we'll definitely have at least one activity in our code this year yeah we're also helping with Africa code week yes imagine if activity that is now live in the editor imagine a world it's it's a it's a really awesome new tutorial super openended and so that's something look forward to you can use that today actually it's a man it's in the skaters are right now we designed that specifically for one of these competing so yeah questions I also see we have a lot of people who are writing in great like requests and feedback about scratch jr. and I'm so we'd love to hear more about that in the survey I don't know we can speak as much to it right now but that's something that we're always thinking about and would love to hear from you in terms of that and we also have like questions about extension someone asking can you make your own extensions uh yes yes the answer is yes and there is documentation that exists to help you let's let's let's circle back to that in like five minutes I'm gonna I'm gonna search because I think I could actually answer that or maybe maybe maybe Natalie or someone in the chat can link to it but but the answer is yes and there's documentation to help you understand how to do that I believe sorry I need to put me on this back so I'm gonna go over here and look at that great and someone's asking about like other physical devices that are supported with scratch I mean we've already you spoke to some of them if you want to mention what hardware right primarily at this point in time the things that Zoe introduced us to for the hardware that we support in the extensions library in scratch or what we're supporting right now but I'm just like our tutorials library that library will also grow over time so death keep an eye on things and check back I don't think that any of us can quite speak to like how soon specific things will be added but um definitely that library will always be growing another pretty common question is about the center sprite tool question will it come back or is it community but it it it is plans to come back we've heard a lot of people say that they want it so I it is it is on the list of things that are coming back I don't know when but I do know it's yeah yeah I was coming back thanks for asking did we miss it yeah okay can I move back to the extension question yes I Google Google this I googled scratch three extension documentation and a links to our github repository oh okay that has what looks like this the specs early the documentation of of making it and I hope that is helpful yeah it should be you can also if people do have a question other other questions should be mentioned that contact us yeah yeah so in the footer of the website I think Eric is gonna most venture screenshare momentarily there is a link that and there's a lot of amazing stuff hidden in the footer of the website yeah but there's also contact us and what happens when you contact us is yeah oh my god we raised under support yeah there it is so what happens when you click contact us it gives you a variety of different ways to get in touch with us but we'll probably expect and you can send us basically an email through the contact us page and those kind of gets sorted and sent to groups on the team that are most able to answer those questions so if you do send a question about resources it does come to the three of us and yeah I will say again I think I mentioned this earlier that everybody on this team really really cares very deeply about everybody who's experienced using scratch so you know we do hear that whatever feedback we get through contact us and we definitely address those yeah I might also say to on this date does have links to some of the facts there's actually a lot of like frequently asked questions that we have addressed on the stretch doesn't pertain to scratch and so sometimes it's good just write check out what's already on the site yeah well would now be a good time to address at some point we got a question about like what do you do when things aren't working so yeah this is one of your options but then you know eric has also mentioned this before that a great resource on the scratch website when you've found something challenging it could just be it could be any number of things it could be like you think you might have found a bug in the website or it could be like your project won't work and you need some help debugging that the forums are super helpful because again the scratch community is amazing and then there are people there are scratchers who you know if you post in the forum and ask a question it's very active and you should get a response and/or a reasonable amount of time to whatever question you're asking so that can be a good way to debug things and get answers to questions as well great someone asked me about what your favorite scratch tips all right now we've already covered a lot of them I don't know anyone has anything else they want to share ravers you're actually doing was a great question I I mean I I guess one thing I think is like the backpack is like a super powerful tool for like collaboration whoa we're getting some weird yeah we get rich and I think I even often forget about like I'll be looking at someone else's project me at home you know see a block stack that's like oh I could use that for you know my own project I often forget about the backpack because it's down at the bottom and sometimes kind of hard to see um so yeah I think that's a really great tool for a collaboration like especially if you're an educator and you're asking kids to do group projects and they're working on individual machines that they can like share sprites and they can share code using the backpack is pretty rebel yeah yeah I would say getting involved in the scratch online community I'm not sure that the tip but there's just so many wonderful helpful kind people there's so much inspiration there backpacking sprites checking out the design studios it's just like a whole nother aspect Oh scratch that just saw them so important yeah I think also exploring extensions I know some people who made the 2.0 2 3.0 switch feel like they you know separating certain things out into extensions you know kind of hit them a little bit but I think that the in a way it kind of highlights all those different things in a way that's really unique and I think like exploring the software extensions is really great if you don't have any hardware and then you know even software extensions allow you to kind of combine the physical and the virtual and interesting ways like video sensing is really fun so don't forget about extensions I guess great so we only have time for a couple more questions and please do keep asking them we also encourage you to write into the contact us and we can keep on a chat a little bit someone's asking about strategies for time constraints working with stones with scratch in class starter graphics for those for that yeah yeah so um one thing this is just this is this isn't the whole answer but certainly you could think to us to sort of build off of a starter project if you kind of have limb time so again it's ideas page starter projects and these are sort of so simple that you can just start it begins I see so many people about the dark theme we will get to that in a minute I I think that's maybe one sort of thing that you might think to do is because we have stories games animations to sort of look at some of the code and then start to fill out move in is good yeah that is one aspect of that question yeah and even there are a lot of different ways to look at that question it's like are you designing activities that you feel are easily digestible or are you trying to support longterm deeper learning in scratch in like really short chunks of time so again that's like such a big question that I hope that we can like address that more in scratch and practice on that website yeah because there are so many different ways you could you know kind of make better use of your time in a short class period with scratch yeah so thank you for that question and we should then we think to talk about that more injection practices today I mention the dark theme so we're aware that people wanted our theme there's no information that could pass along to you that it's going to happen or not happening but rest assured yeah yeah we know about it yeah it's also put it in the survey also questions about our history so someone asked us about logo instakill ago and someone else s why scratch is called scratch it is and I actually um mentioned this really quickly in the chat but yeah it's because I I thought it was because of like cats scratch but it actually is because that DJ's scratching records and like making new music and like because such an important part of scratch is remix in and like changing things up and taking different elements and combining them together that is where it originally came from then I think when they were picking a logo they were like it cats do scratch so that and and the idea of like making projects from scratch well it makes it so every time when I want to say oh yeah like I made this from scratch I mean I couldn't make it in trash you isn't that fun that you can't stop making something the fun that keeps on giving so I think we have to probably wrap up pretty soon oh there any final reminders that we'd like to share I don't know no we've never done the survey again yeah so if you have more feedback or questions we'd love to hear from you either at the contact us link that we shared or at the survey so we also will be back live again in a we are happy you want to come back we're we're here live July 23rd now the next Tuesday at 7 p.m. a week from the day yes 700 p.m. Eastern Time cool yeah and there's a Twitter chat which will be in August to make sure the date right Omega 6 yeah you know what might be fun to is yeah so the scratching practice hash tag is also we invite people on Twitter to be sharing a lot of a lot of these questions are like totally totally related to scratch and practice and so if the chats gonna probably end when we shut down the broadcast so like if you have some of these questions about like oh there's time constraints how do we get around that I would totally suggest on Twitter you know raising that question with the have no distraction practice because that's something that we check you know every day and we'd love to see a lot of conversations or using that hashtag yeah yeah we I was just trying to leave up that link for a bit but yeah yeah this is fun I'm glad yeah they haven't done too many webinars and this is kind of our one of our first hopefully hopefully people thought it was helpful oh yeah yeah we'd love to stay in touch so we're again we're back Tuesday the 23rd at 7 p.m. and we also have a Twitter chat August 6 at 730 p.m. and so we'd love to also handle talk about more questions there as well yes yeah thank you all for joining us I mean I think my biggest fear that is that we do this and there'd be like one person watching and there no questions so thank you all so much for all of your questions and bringing out for an hour with us yeah this was awesome I can't really I see yeah
