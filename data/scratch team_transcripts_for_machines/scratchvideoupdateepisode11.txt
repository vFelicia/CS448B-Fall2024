hi everyone welcome to another scratch video update i'm rick ross also known as rick ross on scratch and i am eric also known as speak visually on scratch anything this is episode unless episode 11 double digit su sauce we were in Amsterdam covering scratch conference and now we're back in Boston outside the immediate lab yeah so let's jump in to love it I love it there so the lovett section is projects that Rick arose and i have found in the community that we love and so there was one i came across that was by the user sensitive and was called sneak peek and it was a sneak peek of a game they were working on and you get to just play through sort of the first level and get to test out the controls and I thought it was nice because I think a lot of times myself included we can be a bit afraid to share project because we want to make sure it's perfect but I think it's cool and it's really beneficial to share before it's done because you can get feedback and so that was really cool to see ya and I also liked seeing people's process exactly yeah so another thing that we loved is in the summer mean by firewall 400 its started it started as one project and it's a simple project where like the music starts playing and there's this adorable cat and then all of a sudden the music starts dancing it starts dancing and the title also has remixed it and so people have been remixed again it's been over a hundred and fifty projects yeah it's pretty awesome you're having a bad day you can just go through the remixes and they make you smile yes and and beyond Katz is also a raccoon that dance yes there's other ones taking there's an alien that's called all adore walhalla equally adorable you should try three mixing it too yes which brings us to our next section things to try it's always we have to like things to try cool so I always talk about the scratch design studios you know this but there is a new scratch design studio the scratches entity a scratch island and so that's essentially some explorers found in island that is shaped like scratch cat although it doesn't need to be shaped like scratch cat but anyways the idea is you get to explore the island and see what you find so who lives there what language do they speak was the flag look like what does the island look like and so there's been some pretty awesome scratch islands that have been created so I would encourage you all to check it out it's on the homepage there scratch design studio awesome another thing you might want to try is so there's gonna be a number of events happening number of things to try number of things to try and it's gonna feature so different regions of the world in Europe and Latin America they're doing code weeks and that's going to drive a lot of activity on this site and we're also creating all kinds of activities and there's a dance one thats related to you code week yeah and there's also gonna be a lot of new people on the site so you should welcome them yeah give them the scratch or welcome say hi maybe leave some feedback on their projects I think it's gonna be a very exciting time community yeah so we'll have the dates for all those I think it's gonna go

the in the coming months cool coming weeks I kids studying weeks yes um so with that we also have we ever final segment magazine especially drumroll please what is our message from the scratch yes so you might have noticed earlier this month that the site was up and down and you might have seen like a pico a character with other servers and technical schools and what that meant was the servers were down because we did some upgrades and then go exactly according to plan and so the site for a couple days there was pretty shaky and without some project went viral which is just checking as we have a project link there there's the there's a spacelander project that was shared on a lot of different new sites around the internet and so that sort of made the server go even slower it's like a perfect storm but there's nothing wrong with projects going viral we love that and so we have to make sure our servers can handle it yeah and our developers have been working really hard to make the site more robust and be able to respond to like new changes and also things that just happen in the world would scratch and you want to thank you for your patient thank you so much for your patience we apologize for that so what do you do when the site goes down or you're experiencing issues is a good thing to talk about so one thing you can do is to go to the bugs and glitches forum it's the bugs and glitches forum is if you're as if you're on the website you see something website said you can go to the bugs and glitches forum and just leave us a note in a forum post of what's happening yeah you can also so if the site is not available we do leave a link to the offline scratch editor so you can keep on scratching yeah and download that yeah even if the site is up it might be good to just have the offline enemies so you're not interrupted absolutely and one more thing one you can also send a message to help at scratched mit.edu and then we can look at it an email message that way mmhmm yeah real people look at real people get it yes okay so i think that's speaking of checking emails I should probably go back and check some emails so I think we're gonna leave it at that we'll see you all next episode scratch on John bye you
