hi everyone welcome back to a new year I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on Scratch and I am Eric also known as speak visually on Scratch and I need a haircut really badly with that said welcome to episode two of our weekly updates um if you didn't catch episode one um in these videos we're going to talk about things that are happening in the community um and so last episode we asked you all to come up with names for this show and we had like over a hundred suggestions thank you all for sending in suggestions it was hard to pick just one so what we decided to do was take little bits of each one and put them together and so what did we come up with scratch video update scratch video update it's pretty straightforward but we're happy with the name um and it's sort of a combination of all these other names so with that said we're go to uh our first segment of the episode which is loved it is it love it or loved it uh I I continue to love it you continue to love it so it's love it um so I think we're going to focus um this uh this episode episode on studios in the lit section so there was a studio that we recently featured called just like real life and this studio is around the theme of simulations so a simulation is sort of mimicking what happens in real life so there's an eating simulator there's an airplane simulator and there's one simulator that I really like it's where you watch a pot of of water boil it takes like 5 minutes you just sit there and you watch the scratch project and you have to be patient and then you can make your macaron onion cheese wow I don't know I actually went through the whole 5 minutes of there I was just sitting there was the was it delicious the suspense was yes it was delicious and it was very suspenseful great another studio uh that we found it's called the scratch construction zone and in this studio you can uh submit a project so you can uh drop a link of your project in the comments and they'll add it and it's an opportunity for for you and other scratchers to check out your project but more importantly to get uh constructive feedback so that's where they got the construction zone uh name from and we'll leave a link to that studio both of those studios in the post with the video so with that said we have our second segment things to try Triple T things to try we're really happy about this so with that said um my things to try is we actually have a bunch of cool new sounds in the library they were made by um a student here in Boston his name is Connor and he makes Beats He makes music and he made us some new Loops for Scratch and so definitely check those out and also we have new Sprites we have new dancing Sprites we have what like seven or eight new Sprites that you can play with and they have actually re real dance moves I these aren't real dance moves they have much better looking dance moves than that and you can you can choose from them and you can make a dancing Sprite which is pretty pretty awesome yeah I will never dance again I promise but you will dance and scratch you will dance in scratch I'm much better dancing in scratch another thing to try that we uh just released is uh if you go into the editor into the tips window which is in like the upper right hand part there's a new tutorial called creating your own virtual pet it's very adorable and you can create um let's say What's a what's a pet like a a puppy a puyy a virtual puppy a virtual unicorn if you've always wanted one and you can make it interactive so it could do things like um you can feed it or you can play with it or can interact with other Sprites so check out the new tutorial uh in the tips window cool thanks for sharing that riar Rose um so now our next segment is going to be drum roll message from
