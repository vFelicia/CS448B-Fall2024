are we are we alive I think that we are live hello everybody it is so great to have you all wait a minute or two before starting just to let people come in in case people are still joining now but welcome to this episode of the scratch create along if this is your first time joining welcome I'm so happy you're here if you were here last week welcome back it's great to have you again last week was so much fun and I am so excited that we are doing this again yeah if this is your first time joining let me tell you a little bit about what the create belong is in the create belong I we thought it would be nice if the we had a time an hour in the week where we all scratched community got to make projects together with a project idea that will share with you all and then everyone can make a project with that prompt or with that project idea um if you're a caregiver or a parent this could be something that you do with the scratcher or scratchers in your house if you're an educator this could be an activity that maybe gives you an idea for an activity to do with your students we actually saw a couple of educators saying that last week that was so exciting so happy to hear that um but if you're anyone this is just a time to make a scratch project we'll all be together uh and yeah uh that's the guy that's the idea um let me uh show you what the plan for today's live stream is so we're gathering now um I will we'll take a look at last week's projects uh for last week's theme which was I'll create an animated animated greeting card people made all these projects it was amazing so we'll take a look at those in the studio um then right after that I will share with you what the prompt is for this week and then we will have a lot of time to just create together um everyone you know you can all be making scratch projects you can have this YouTube window open is when you YouTube open in one window I have your scratch project open another be working on that during that project creation time if you have questions or comments you can send them to me at this link uh bit dot ly / create a log and I'll keep that out the whole time so yeah send in your questions I'll be answering questions that come in you can ask for an idea for a project or for help doing a certain thing or just let me know how the streak is going uh so yeah and then at the end you will have I will show you how to share your project if you want to uh so yeah that is the plan for today and uh so speaking of looking at last week's projects let's take a look at the projects from last week these were so wonderful with the prompt uh make a greeting card people just made there's so many positive messages they're like you know may all be well have a nice day got this stay at home lots of good messages around you know what to do in these times you know about staying safe a lot of people say me missed each other birthday so cute uh you know people saying they're thinking of each other you're awesome uh you know so many words for their dad this has lots of random kind messages I dished this is so wonderful to see all of these you like you all added so much positivity to the world you know cards for people it's just michype go in and look at every project right now but that would probably take up the whole stream time but I will always look at the projects on my scratch account afterward because it is so fun to see all the different directions people take the prompts so everyone who joined will ask me this was just amazing um yeah and speaking of this week's that speaking of prompts uh let me share with you this week's prompt uh so the prompt for this create along is introduce a character uh maybe with all this time at home maybe you've been reading a lot of books maybe you've been watching a TV show that in love maybe there's just a character that you love from your childhood maybe you know you sewing that maybe those books or TV shows you've been watching there's a character that you just enjoy so much maybe you have an original character oh I know so we people who have original characters and I always love seeing them I am so excited to see all the original characters people have um or maybe um you're like I don't know what character I want to do and don't worry we will find a character for you but yes that's the idea for today is make any project about a character in some way um the all all there's a link and I'll go into this in a second but there's a link in the description too we have a starter project that can show you what like a character introduction could be like so we have this project that like introduces a character and has a little bit of info about them so that's you know one thing you can do you can use this project as a as a starting point I'll show you how to do that um but anyway and and you know sending in your questions to the link um yeah and enjoy it now welcome to the create along we're about to start making scratch projects together so what you're going to do to open scratch is go to scratch.mit.edu and I'll let me put up the link for where that you can go to do this um anyway go to scratch.mit.edu and click on create I'll keep this link up for a little while so that you can so that you can see it in case you're joining just now but I'll try to take it down soon and think last week I forgot to take the link down I'm gonna meant to but yes so scratch.mit.edu and click create and then once you're in here in scratch um you can close this tutorial it you can watch it if you want to but it shows you the basics of getting started but but this is a scratch in case you haven't seen it before I will give you just a little explanation Oh kind of the idea of scratch um so it's right you have these characters that are called sprites and over here you've got all these blocks of you know sort of code that you can drag out and then you can click on them to have the characters do the thing it says on the walk so you give this a click it says move ten steps and when I click it you know the cat moves ten steps and you know you can combine it with tons of other blocks if you have it move and then turn and have it just turn a lot spinning around you I don't know this one says go to random position you click that makes it go to somewhere around them um and you know you can you can make a character say something you drag out you know say hello and then go to a random position so that is a the idea of scratch is that you have characters and you can make them do stuff with the blocks over here ah so let's get started making projects about characters um you can just start making and if you'd like some ideas for how to begin on a project with a character I'll give you some ideas right now so let me make a new project and I think even before we jump in to you know how you make a project about a character it could be nice to think about what character you'd like to make a project about so I there's there's a favorite book character could be a character you do you could think if yeah one of your favorite TV shows like I said there's character that you just love you could make a project about them oh yeah if there's like a historical figure you love you can make a project about then if you're educator and you're studying uh you know some figure with your class you can make it right about that person um you could also um make i if i'm yeah as i mentioned you could do an original character of yours that would be so awesome to see and you also if you're stumped on idea for a character you're still nothing is coming to mind something I like to do is just hover over this choose a right button and just click surprise spray okay saxophone okay I want to see who will be playing this saxophone Oh Anna guitar okay they're gonna be a very musical character but so you can okay so yeah this character hannah has a guitar kind of want to keep choosing getting more that's a line that's maybe not that inspiring but um oh my gosh I got Andy again I got Andy last week um you know you can keep just doing surprise stuff until you get some idea for a character to do and I'm just getting lots of musical instruments and people and but so yeah maybe you've got like a fairy who plays the saxophone and then that's your that's your character who knows big I don't know what will come up for you but that that could be one way of just getting an idea of something random um but I don't think about what character I'll do first one of my favorite books is Matilda um and I I love Matilda so much of a character also the book but definitely the character um so maybe don't do a little something about her and the we have a tutorial that can help you get started and I'll show walk you through the first few steps of it with Matilda character um so if you go to the tutorials library click on that button that says tutorials you can go down and we have this tutorial called animate a character so let's open it up actually I'm going to make a new project with all these lovely people maybe not very Matilda's project um so when you click on the tutorial get this this video pops up I won't watch it right now because that would be like a video within a video but the video walks you through how you can animate a character and also you can click the next step and it'll show you a step towards making a character so this one says to add a backdrop so I'll hover over the choose a backdrop button and click Choose and Matilde spends a lot of time at school so and I think there is a school background okay yes okay I think it's school background would be a pretty a nice one for Matilda um and then it says you have to add a sprite okay now this I'll have I'll add this character to be Matilda see if I'm gonna see if I can find someone who looks sort of like Matilda and then that could be at least a nice starting point so I'll hover over choose a sprite button and click Choose new D I actually something okay something about the ballerina reminds me of Matilda I don't know really something about the energy about her uh I might change her dress from pink to like on dark blue cuz I feel like dark blue is more like Matilda's outfit color but I think that's a good like base to be Matilda um so then I'll like click to the next step and the and I'll show how I'll make her oh you know what and I should take off the create link now uh I probably should have done it a little bit earlier still gotta keep myself remembering about that um so okay so the first step and also think I will get rid of the scratch cat just click on it and click the trash icon you'll never forgotten I will see you in the next mute project i me so um trying to find place to put this is tutorial window um so i the first step if this animated character has me says you can drag out a when green flag clicked block which is yellow so i'll go to the events categories yellow one drag out that and then you know i also may change her name to Mathilde because that is who she is um and then then it says you can drag out uh say hello for two seconds block so I will go and grab that um also I will get to answering some questions from the from the questions but first I'm just gonna show how you can use the anime character tutorial a little bit since I think that could be a nice starting point um so okay so say hello for two seconds that seems like a fair thing for to do for introducing Matilda yes and also I can add on more things so I can ever say my name is seems good for introducing her and also you're like one of her character traits is that she loves reading so maybe I will have her then say like like I love reading could write out a longer version of that but I also don't to type that much yeah my name is Matilda I love reading yeah so this is just a way that you could use this tutorial to like just get started with making the character introducing them telling the world a little bit about them before I oh you know I just saw from the comments back the tutorial windows a little hard to see because of the UM because of the questions link so I'm gonna put the tutorial up seer yeah let me know that that's what the tutorial window showed is like how you say hello um thanks for sending in the questions and comments um yes and actually I'll get two more questions and comments in a second but I promised I would show you how to use this um this base this um introduce a character or like starter project we have so I'll show you how you could use that as like a base because that could be another way to get started with making a project about your character so and this link by the way is in the description of this YouTube video there's a link to this starter project so you can open that up and yeah I mean you can just click see inside and and so now you can sort of look at how this person did this project and you know you could go in oh and I just remembered that I also wanted to show how to change the color of Matilda's dress and then show that insight um yeah you could go in and instead of this person's character you could choose a costume and add your character takes it a moment when you are also live streaming but you know whatever your character might be you can add admin do a my yeah you could add your character in and then that would be the it's not what I meant pic but yeah like this is a good one um so yeah you could put your character there if your character is Amina dance um and then that that's how like this something this could be about your character you could also go click on this sprite that has a text description and then change what the text is so you know favorite color maybe instead of any kind of green it's her favorite words probably not uh so favorite word is dance so anyway that's that's a one way that it's like super to start making a project about a character that I just want to show you I also said I would show you how to change Matilda's dress color I'm going to shrink this tutorial window um so yeah because I think that uh one it's nice when you can find a sprite in the library that's sort of it gets the idea of your character and then you can just change them a little bit to UM to both your character a bit more so instead of this blue color for her dress you pick out a saree exceda the pink color I can pick out up something in the blue range and then maybe darken it a bit by having a brightness feel lower and then yeah click on this fill bucket tool and then yeah I feel like that suddenly is more like a school uniform and you know just to complete it all all you know change the color of her maybe make her tights like kind of gray or something like that goes in and yeah now suddenly that's like I pervy that's totally Matilda um yeah all right uh now I wanted to get to some questions that were coming in Oh someone says can we make a character from a book any character absolutely any character it could be a character from a book but it could be you know truly any character one you came up with you could make a character by just drawing random squiggles in the costumes tab and you know go like that's something I'll do sometimes you put if you hover over the choose a sprite button and click think and I'll show a few more ways of drawing a character probably later in this dream but you know you could just draw something totally random I don't know that's a circle that's a face and then you can have like eyes with some more circles I change the color and then get the paintbrush and like and I just created this character and I already love it and I want to know his story name smile we very very creative name it's actually a family name um but yeah anyway truly any character um oh okay can we make a character who loves pizza bagels and speaks Morse code it's a very important question and the answer is yes you can do that I I'm glad I'm glad uh that you know we uh we got sort of an out you can make a character who loves pizza bagels and speaks Morse code Oh someone asks how do you delete a character um uh well I can't bring myself to delete smiley so I'm not gonna show on smiley because I I they're too wonderful but um I'll show you no new link so going to scratch.mit.edu slash create um and if you have oh gosh I should this is gonna take a long time to load but I couldn't delete smiley um actually wait I have a better idea okay so say I so the way to delete a character is you can click on this trash icon you should once key so you select them and then click on the trash icon so say I say that I wanted to delete smiley I could click on them and then click the trash so that's how you would do beep but I want smiley back and this is how you can do that say I'm like oh no wait I don't want to delete smiley you can go up to edit and click restore sprite and that will bring your character back if you accidentally deleted someone that you did not want to delete um yes thank you for the questions Oh someone else asks a flower asks can a person be ourselves yes I think they totally can be yourself that would be awesome I think that the only important thing is to just not include any personal information like your name um or anything don't put a picture of yourself but I think as long as you know it's a drawing of yourself or a representation of yourself then that is totally fine i think that's one oh thanks for the question Oh Oh another question someone asks can we animate it yes totally I think that would be awesome uh in fact uh maybe all showed how you can animate a character um let me make a new project actually I've made a new one here didn't I yes I did haha um so all all another there are technically two characters but I can kind of gonna count them as one another favorite characters of mine is Fred and George so I think I want to show a I'll show this with Fred and George um I'm gonna see if I can find someone people category I think this could be a pretty good Fred and George character it might be a hair a little tiny bit more orange bucket pick out an orange nice okay yes that's gonna duplicate them and this would be George this one red so one way to animate character is you can oh you know what I'm gonna change their hair color in the many costumes that they have cuz this character has many poses and I'm gonna change them okay there we go now they're all orange um so one way of animating a character if it happens to have multiple costumes and you can is and you can click on this block to see if the character does have multiple costumes is with this next costume block so you could you can click on that you can also have that happen inside of a loop so you could have now Fred change costumes many times look okay that was very fast needed going to the next costume many times but I think I will slow that down maybe like wait putting a week block and have it wait point five seconds so yeah anyway um now this character has poses built in but say uh it was a character that didn't have opposed built in uh you could take your first pose and uh and you could duplicate it and then try and sort of move the the points around or let move the parts of the sprite around so maybe I can take this arm and move it oh oh no it's not quite an arm under there so that is one thing about some of the scrap sprites and scratches they don't all you don't are also easy to animate um but the you can uh you can experiment around see if you can make different poses oh boy that's not great um but you can also like draw your own character so I could draw my own fret and then uh do pick out some kind of the color for the head of Fred and get a color for the UM hair could be a sort of very oval based Fred and do the circle I really like just making characters out of circles um do all make some eyes actually taller eyes there's one there's two going to make mouth and you can then duplicate this costume because once you draw yourself are probably gonna be easier to animate than ones from the scratch library as as you can see sometimes it depends based on sprite but then you can go in and like for instance with this this tool which lets you hit the points of a shape you can make in this one mate he and be like smiling and then you can animate between these two and that's like way to make a character be talking so that's just some ideas of how to animate a character oh I just saw that there are more questions coming in oh okay someone asks how do you create a character from a PNG file it's a great question I will show you um so let's say let me Oh No well it wasn't that I want to go to scratch alright let's say you find an image of your character online that can be a great thing to do if there isn't a scratch sprite that reminds you of them or if you don't feel like drawing or whatever it might be um and so one character I really love also is there's a book I read when I was younger called amazing grace where named character is increased or she plays Peter Pan in her school play he's such a good book she's one of my favorite characters of all time so if I go to Google Images and look up a picture of her oh here she is okay yes um there's her playing Peter Pan um I can go and find a you know some image your purse um um a JPEG or PNG image and then I can right click on it and save it my computer I want to show this so that you can see a howl howl um uh what's your getting a character so you can show it as you can see an image to have so I added I saved to my computer this picture of grace and then so how to make a new project for her a different from this wonderful friend George project um I'll show you how you can upload that JPEG or PNG into your project it'll just take a moment for my computer is truly truly laboring okay so so how you can bring in a PNG or a JPEG these hover over this choose a sprite button and what you do is you go up to the top option which is upload sprite and then you can click on that and and click on the image that I loaded that I that I downloaded and then you've got the character in the project uh I will once again delete the scratchpad cat by clicking on it clicking delete um so yeah so now you have this character in there so in case you missed that to get an image from the internet or from your computer into your project as your character you just hover over this choose a sprite button and go all the way up to upload and click upload and then you'll be able to pick a file from your computer that's a great question someone raincloud asks can you use the texttospeech or mathilde yes totally oh that's a great question um for those of you which one is my Matilda project uh yes sir she is okay uh smiley maybe will hide he'll be sort of a secret surprise in this project um so for those of you that don't know on the texttospeech blocks that you can add to scratch um are are um really good for making a character say something out loud and so let me go to to to add the texttospeech blocks go to UM this square button down here which is add an extension and you click on it the extensions that we have to scratch which are things you can but even more blocks train Adam to scratch will show up and so this is this one texttospeech uh I had kinda thought of showing I use this one but this is such a good fit for this project Thank You brain cloud I love this idea you click the added text to speech by clicking this button and now these new box show up so make sure that this sound will play on you can drag out one of these blocks and click on it whatever you write here the character will say hello hope you all could hear that um so you know here you can how the characters say my name is Mathilda my name is Mathilda and my teacher is Miss my teacher is Miss Honey and you know so anyways you can have the character say whatever you want to in there and so you you can also set the voice to something different in here this is the voice Alto but you can set it to Turner you could say um let's see like I can move things with my mind I can move things with my mind maybe that voice doesn't fit right over that well but there's also the voice squeak you try I can they're staying right in my mind so anyway that's the texttospeech blocks that's some of what they can do a great way of introducing a character um yeah and you can also set the language that you want them to be speaking in so if you set the language to do to Spanish and then if you write words in Spanish it will read them actually in Spanish so you can have them say oh I was yeah oops trying to do the upsidedown exclamation point oh yeah yeah so then the character says hola and they'll say it in Spanish so you can set the language and have them speaking whatever language you want um yeah so great question um let's see okay oh and I wanted to remember I wanted to mention something about using images for your that you can put in your project one good thing to remember is that oh it's always important to give credit for the images so if I were going to share this project I would put in the notes and credits um you know Oh like I got this image from and I find whatever the source was that I you know it's got it from Google Images wherever I got it so or if it's image but you know found by an artist online to give credit so just wanted to mention that um okay more questions uh someone asks what if you do meet some code thanks in advance Robert in advance um if you delete some code uh what you can do let's say I'll make some code I'll have a grace say when green flag clicked I'll have her say my name is Grace Oh didn't mean to switch the view there oh that's um so however say my name is Grace and then let's say I accidentally delete this code by dragging it over there uh what you can do is hit command Z I will bring it back so commandz or controlz um that will there's like the undo key that you would use um we'll bring back the code and I think you can do that until you've exited out of the project um you should be able to undo and get the code back um so yes that's a really good question um someone asks um there's so many good questions which border which oh okay okay someone asks I am trying to rotate sprite around a circle but when I use the rotate block it doesn't rotate around the circle it rotates around the middle how could I fix this I am going to I think I know what you mean so let me I'm just gonna get a sprite to show it with um so here's say the the let me make sure I really have then it can you understand the question so try to rotate a spray around a circle it doesn't retire outraged okay yeah so if I understand right you have a sprite say to the Apple um and I'll actually group all this by selecting it all on clicking group so you have a sprite and you want it to rotate around like this but instead it's rotating around uh like this so you can see in scratch where the center of the costume is and that's like this little like cross hairs right here so what you can do is if so during your the spray is going to rotate around this this point in the in the costume then this point right here so by default it's rotating around like this but if you put your sprite outs here then it will it will still be rotating around at this point and so then it'll rotate out here in the circle so now if I'm on the Apple and I click uh turn fifteen degrees it will rotate out in this big circle and in the opposite direction if what you want is for it to rotate around its middle then you can drag it to this sort of center mark and then uh this will rotate around there I hope that answered your question if it didn't sound good number oh um oh my gosh these questions are also wonderful um okay uh someone asks um how do you make it so your character will wait till you press space to say something great question on I will I'll show you maybe on a grace so so let's say that I want her to say this my name is Grace but I don't want to say it when the green flag is clicked I want her to say it when the space key is pressed so there's a couple of options um if I want her to say it every time that someone presses the space key then I can drag out this when space key pressed block and then attach it to that and now I guess you'll be able to see this but I have pressing space key now she says my name is Grace every that I press the space key so that's one way the when space key press block is great for that now on the other hand you might want her to only say it the first time you click the space key and there's an easy way to do that too so in in the control category there's this helpful block wait until and wait until will wait until some certain thing happens and then it will go and do this the block next to it those are lock under it so if I say wait until blank I haven't filled in this blank yet but once that blank thing happens then it will progress and start doing this so have them say my name is Grace um but let me so what what how do I put in something to fill this blank you see this blank has these angles and block that has these angles will go in there it's any block where the answer to that block is like a yes or no so you know for instance like no touching mouse pointer question mark that's either gonna be a yes or a no for any sprite so if it's if the if the character is touching the mouse pointer it will start doing the next thing but if it isn't it'll keep waiting and as you'll see this is key space pressed block um say like a question um it also has these angles on it so it can go in here and so now when I click the green flag you can see with this yellow highlight that this code is happening and it it still hasn't gotten to this save awk so it's still on this wait until it's still waiting until I press the space key and so then when I do and I am gonna do it there we go it says she says my name is Grace um but now if I do it again she won't say it again because as you can see it's it's not this highlight is gone it's done with this block it's not going to it's not going to keep waiting for me to press again I did it once so it's like okay I'm done um anyway so that's a wonderful question I love this wait until block it can be useful for so many things um anyway yes so thank you for asking that someone asks can we introduce two characters for example two brothers totally uh actually I guess I kind of did that you asked us before but um yeah you can totally have two brothers you could make two characters talk to each other uh actually maybe I'll show you how to do that really quickly um so I'll click on friend and I have oh that's like okay wait so this one is gonna be Fred and this one is gonna be George it's a little confusing because they're twins um I'll have Fred strike a different pose I'll pick this pose for Fred um so so I'll get rid of this um one way you can make two characters talk to each other is you got this you can have when dreams likely so when the when the project starts with someone starts the project um you can have one of them say something so uh Fred could say hi I'm Fred and then it's a red we'll do that when this starts and then you can click on the other character and have a jour also how this also happen when the green flag is clicked we have George also say something so let's see if this works also have George say and I'm George uh so now the other thing is that they talk at the same time because when I click the green flag a friend is saying hi I'm Fred and George is saying hi I'm George they both start right then so you could use a wait block to make George talk after Fred and Fred talks for two seconds so Jorge all also having wait two seconds and then save and then introduce himself hi I'm Fred and I'm George um awesome oh my gosh it is so awesome I just saw that a lot of new people are joining the stream Oh welcome everyone it's so great to have you in case you are doing just now uh this is the scratch create along where we make scratch projects together for an hour in a week and all I've given up prompt which is to make a project introducing a character so I've shown a couple ways you could get started with that you could you can make a project introducing a couple of characters you could make I made this project introducing Matilda from the book Matilda there's this project introducing they character briefs from amazing grace so you can make a project about any character from a book or a TV show or one of your original characters which I know so many people have I any any character you want make up a character for this totally random character um and we are we're we got probably we got 17 minutes left so you don't have to finish your project in this time but rather you think of this time as a time when you could start the project and then throughout the week you can keep you can share the project to a studio because you have a studio where everyone can submit the prior it not submit but you can just add the projects you make everyone mad projects to that studio um in fact at the end of the stream I will show you how you can add to the studio because I saw there was a question where someone asks um how to share this project and I will show you at the end of the of the stream how you can share um so yeah anyway excited to have new people join me um okay uh oh oh great question someone asked um how to have a person move and say a thing at the same time from Hayden okay that's a great question thank you asking it so let me I can show you on grace again um I'll have her not wait until the space key press to start talking so for those joining just now now I have this project where when I click the green flag my character grace says my name is Grace and a way to make a character do two things at the same time is so I have this walk that the when green flag clicked that and this thing will start happening when the green flag is clicked but I can have another one I can have two blocks that book the start uh when the green flag is clicked actually I can have as many as I want so also when the green flag is clicked I could have let's see what else could I have great stood I could have her glide to a random position so just like wide somewhere on the screen so this is gonna happen and this is gonna happen at the same time so I click the green fly she does the both at the same time I thought gliding somewhere could be kind of nice because like she could fly anywhere she wants to um so yes so I correctly replied both of these things happen at the same time um in fact that can be so earlier in the stream I showed how to use the texttospeech blocks to make a character talk aloud and that can be I'm gonna get clean up this is my Mathilda project I'm gonna clean up these blocks a little bit um I'm the she's gonna clean it up so the texttospeech blocks can be a great thing to have that the the sticks of speech where they really speak block you can have that happen at the same time as they're saying it in a speech bubble because with these purple like say hello blocks the character said that in a speech bubble but with this speak into this green speak block if I say hello hello oh I still have the language set to English sorry to Spanish so I'm gonna set the language back to English um hello so I click on that and the character says aloud hello um so uh you that say I want those two things to have at the same time I can do the same thing where I have to when green flag clicked blocks drag them out and then I don't think I'll close this tutorials window um hello so then it's really nice effect when you click the green flag the character says it in trouble and also says it out loud it can be nice because sometimes it's actually kind of hard to hear what they're saying with the texttospeech if you don't see it usually also so anyway that's just a tip but I wanted to share oh okay Oh someone asks um how can I make my letters move side to side this is a great question um let me make a new project and add a letter oh and you know what I see that it is now 147 this time passes so fast uh with you all the stream will last actually just saw a question come in of when how long will a stream last it will last until 2 p.m. by thinking about 3 to 5 minutes I'm gonna start showing how you could make an account if you don't have an account and also how you could share to the studio but I'm gonna try to answer a couple of a couple of less questions before that so for instance this question of um uh and also you don't have the link you're just doing now go to scratch.mit.edu slash create and then you can uh that's that's that's where you can make a project like this one it'll open up this page um so so how to make letters move around so uh actually first let me just show how you could get a letter sprite so you can hover over that choose a sprite button and click Choose and actually up here we have this letters category um so say you know that I was doing project about Matilda so I'll use an M um so you have now this letter sprite and there's a couple of ways of making a lair move from side to side um you can have it uh move ten steps that'll make it move in whatever direction it's pointing and it starts pointing this direction so you haven't letter move like that maybe you want it to start out over here so if you drag sprite anywhere this block go to a position in this position which is X&Y tells you the position of a sprite um this box will update with the position that that sprite is so if I drag it to them here the position is negative 11 and 6 but if I drag it to here it changes to that so I can drag it to where I want it to start and then drag out this go to block and the sprite will start there and then you could have it once it starts there but move many times moved like that you can have it then this will reset it back to there you can also have it instead of having to click this move block over and over again you can have this repeat loop around the move block and then attach that there and then it moves like that yeah that's just one way you can also have you can use the the change X by ten block makes the sprite move it also be the my prime move sidetoside so there's lots of different ways of doing it um and then also if you want it to go back you could one thing I can do is I can right click on these blocks and duplicate them and then I can attach it down here and I could make it change X by putting a mind I prefer minus sign and then it will go in the opposite direction so it will go it will start there and then go back there so anyway that's some ways of moving letters side to side um and I saw another question that I'll try to answer before before I um before I have to start wrapping up um someone asks how do I take a picture of my dog to add as a sprite and love that um so you can go to the copy action theory ellamy you can hover over choose a sprite and click paint to create a new sprite and then oh sure once you've painted in news when you clicked paints to make a new sprite you can hover over this button and go to here and click camera and then I'll give it permission to use my camera um and then you probably see me twice uh and so you can take a photo with your camera and I you shouldn't take a photo of yourself so I make to take a photo of my lamp and have that be my dog hover over that and click camera okay my lamp is gonna be my dog yeah very good um and um and so then you have this photo and now that can be your spray and just pretend the instead of my lamp and my chair it was your dog which is possibly much cuter so and then you know you can do all the you know drag out all these code blocks and have them apply to your picture of your dog or lamp and see if you have it spin around or whatever you want so anyway I love that question I'd love to see figures or people's dog oh it looks like we have eight minutes left so I think in case you don't have an account I will show you how you can make an account um and oh my gosh I am so excited to see the project that you've been making I'm like it's the highlight of my week looking at them uh so yes let me show um how do we get a count so uh let's yeah you know
