are we are we live let me see oh yeah i think we are live uh hello everybody uh welcome thank you so much for coming to this uh create along i'll wait a minute or two or a tiny bit before we start because there may be people who are still coming but hi welcome i see there are already uh viewers that's amazing i'm very excited right now um the uh yeah i i am so happy to have all of you uh oh my gosh the number's going up okay um yeah the we uh we wanted to do uh these uh create alongs because i think it could be really wonderful for us to be like connected in this time when we're all apart uh and we thought this would be a really nice opportunity to uh get the scratch community feeling connected the all the scratch community of scratchers families everyone um and uh get us making things with each other and uh getting ideas from each other's projects uh so yeah we are trying these create alongs out um it's all very experimental we will see uh see how it goes but um uh actually maybe i should wait like a minute more before this is i don't know i don't know how punctually people come to live streams but hello everybody uh thank you for coming um yeah uh i'll i'll i'll give like a minute more and then i'll explain the the plan for this live stream but just uh really really excited to have you excited to make scratch projects in this hour of time with you uh yeah okay i'll so the plan for these create along live streams is um in a moment i will uh share a prompt uh with you all a prompt for that'll be inspiration for creating a scratch project um and uh you will have time to work on a scratch project inspired by that prompt you could take it in any direction um but yeah you'll you'll have time you can have this uh this live stream open in one window in youtube and you can have your scratch open in another window i'll show you how to get to the scratch website in a second in case you don't know uh but yeah so you can have the both of them open and um uh so anyway during that creation time where you all be in parallel working on your projects um i will be uh showing some tips and tricks and ideas of projects in case you uh need inspiration of an idea um i'll be you know uh answering your live questions which you can send which side yes this side okay uh you can send to this uh link bit.ly create along you can ask for help with a project or help deciding what kind of project to make or uh you know just random ideas for things to try in scratch and i will answer your live questions uh so yes send them to this link i will answer as many as i can i can't answer them all but um uh so that's what i'll be doing doing during this project creation time um while you're working on your projects i'll be answering questions and you know showing random stuff you can do in scratch with the prompt uh so uh and then at the end of the live stream uh i will show you how you could share your project if you wanted to you totally don't have to and you also you do not have to be finished with the project at the end of the hour that would be way too short of time but it's the idea is you can start on your project during this time we have together and then keep working on it and then uh and then share later um and i'll show you how to do that but yeah oh you know and i just remembered that i made a graphic to show this plan and i only remembered to show the graphic now but now this is what i just said uh you know we're all learning things here um yeah we are gathering i am going to share a prompt uh we will have a big chunk of time to make together uh during that time i'll answer live questions and then at the very end i will show you how you can share uh so yeah uh i think i think that we have arrived at the time of uh of sharing the prompt so um the prompt let me show uh my uh window with scratch open the prompt for today is in scratch to make a greeting card uh make any kind of card for could be uh for somebody that you appreciate these days uh someone you feel grateful for somebody who makes you smile uh could be for uh you know something you know your cat could be for your dog could be for an inanimate object uh it could be a you know this is this is a card uh you know uh that just says thinking of you you could make something to show someone that you're thinking of them uh here's here's another one you can just make something that says hello friend and uh you know some some kind of little animated thing um but it's totally openended take it however you want um the you you it's you you could say it could be your occasion like a happy birthday card or i think one of my friends on the scratch team just told me that yesterday was international waffle day it could be a card for a random holiday um anyway uh that's that's the the prompt for today it was we thought it would be nice uh to to make stuff for the people in our lives we feel grateful for these days uh and it is always very fun to receive a card and to receive especially uh animated uh card so um that uh that is the uh prompt uh and let us let me now let's let's start making stuff with that prompt if that sounds good to all of you um i will show you how to open up scratch and start making a scratch project so uh you're going to go to scratch.mit.edu create i will keep this uh link up for a while so that you know in case uh people join in a few minutes you can still see it so and and by the way hello to anyone who's joining now uh who didn't see the intro um i'm zoe from scratch team this is a scratch uh create along and we're gonna be making animate a card project you probably heard that part um yes so go to scratch.mit.edu create and that will take you to uh uh this uh page it will take you to the scratch editor uh i'll give you all a second uh so you can all open it up there you know actually i closed the tutorial but when when this page opens up this tutorial will be open uh but you can go ahead and close it or you can keep it open if you want to um it's just uh it's actually going to show something pretty similar to what i will show now which is uh if you need this or if you'd like to see um i'm just going to show a little bit the basics of what scratch is in case you haven't seen scratch before or if it's been a while since you've seen scratch uh so uh in scratch uh you have these characters and you have these um blocks that say different things on them and you can uh drag uh these blocks out into this area i'll zoom it in so you can properly see um drag it out drag these blocks out and then uh you can use them to make the characters do things so uh move ten steps you can you can click on it to see what it does so yeah it's making my scratch clap scratch cat move uh nice and uh you can you know drag them around you can also put in different numbers i can see what happens if i put a hundred steps oh it goes pretty far okay yes nice um yeah you can you can do and there's tons of blocks to try out turn probably going to make the scratch cat turn in some way nice uh and you can also you know try out all the different categories here have different types of things you can make characters do uh there's you know this says say hello for two seconds okay maybe i zoomed it in perhaps a little too much because i'm running out of space for anything so i'm gonna like zoom out okay cool uh that that is that is probably good if it's too small you can always send a question to the questions link um and say it's too small zoom in more uh so anyway uh yeah uh you so it's still spun around but if you click on this scratchcat will say hello nice uh and you can also attach uh different blocks to each other so you like we can grab out this next costume block and see what that does ah it you know what i'm gonna turn the cat there we go that's mostly normal um uh this next costume block you can uh switch the poses of the character go to the next pose and so if we like attach that to this move block maybe i will go back to it being 10 steps that was a little bit more reasonable um i can attach these together and see what they do when i combine them so it moves forward and it goes to the next pose so that's that's that's basically kind of the the idea of how scratch works is you have these things you can make characters do them now uh the let's talk about how you could make a uh a green card in scratch i'll make a new project yes that's okay um make a new project um and so for making a greeting card we we so there you though this scratch cat is one of the sprites we have um we also have if you click on this choose a sprite button take a second to load because i am live streaming um uh there's a bunch of other characters you can choose from and upstairs of this category letters and this is where a lot of those projects i showed got the letters from uh you can get these uh letters and put them into your project uh so i might make a greeting card that says hi uh i'll start with that so i'll get uh i'll you know i like this i'll get an h and get also go back to the letters category oh you know what i do i went through that kind of fast um i what i did was i hovered over the choose a sprite button and just clicked it and now i'm going back to letters and get the i uh and so now we have these letter sprites and we can have them do stuff uh so that's that's a nice way to and to get started with a greeting card now when i say do stuff how do you get an idea for what stuff it could do one thing you can do is go if you go to tutorials we have a tutorial that is called animate a name um but you could it's it really shows a lot of ways of animating letters and actually you could use these things even if your word isn't a name but it's like hi or thinking of you or i didn't do that because i didn't want to drag out that many letters so i understand if you choose to do a short word um but uh yeah so so if you out what i did there is this pops up you could watch the video but because i'm doing a live stream i won't play the video um but you can also uh click this uh right this arrow button and it'll say you can pick a letter sprite so we did that we picked a letter sprite and then it'll give you some ideas of stuff that letters could do so you know i'll this this yellow block says when this sprite clicked um so i can go on over to uh this yellow category events and i'll find that be able to find that block there so drag out when this sprite clicked and then the next one is play sound meow until done and that uh is in the that looks like the dark pink category so sound and uh you can drag this out and then when i click on this h uh it will make a meow sound i hope you can hear it um so that's great uh so yeah so you know you can use these so this will then tell you you can pick another sprite i did that i got the eye and then you can do other things with it so i can click on the i and try out this change color effect block so you know click on that nice and then you get the eye to change color um so yeah that's that's uh sort of some uh some way to jump into making a card is you can get these letter uh sprites and sprite is just what we call any character or anything that's on background that's like you can that is here in scratch uh so you can get these letters and have them do things um and uh now the the one if you need uh help coming up with ideas of what kind of card to make uh you know you could you could think about you know uh i don't know like uh you could start from a lot of ways you could start with who is someone that you uh are you feel very grateful for these days uh and you know they might like to get a card you could think of like a phrase like you know um hope you have a good day or you got this or uh something like that um you know there's tons of uh places you can start i actually there was a question that i saw in the submitted questions oh my gosh people are so many questions oh my gosh okay uh yeah uh there's a question that says all people are saying they're excited oh this is awesome uh the uh oh wow let me answer a couple of these someone says can i make two you could totally make two you can make as many uh as many as you want as many cards as you want um they uh oh you know i also see a question that was um can we make a certain project or free creating totally free creating i mean you could make it with the prompt of animate a card but also if you just want to like make a project while we all make projects together you can totally do that too uh the um uh oh you know what i can probably take off the link now i think um good i think i put it in a place where it didn't cover stuff but i'll all i'll just take off the the link and so that oops uh so that um uh we can um you know it's a little bit less stuff going on um uh we're also getting uh oh yeah so yes the other question i saw was someone said uh how how do i uh get an idea for a project and i want to say one other way of getting an idea is that you could um you could um uh go to we have a studio which is linked in the description of this video i'll click on it here i have it open so we have this studio that has um the projects in it and um and it's like some projects around this idea so if you're looking for an idea or looking for a way to do something you can always check out these projects like i don't know let's see what this one does you always look at these and get some inspiration there so that's just one more place you could get an idea from uh everything is taking a little bit of time to load but uh that's fine okay so click yeah so you could get an idea from that and uh and uh if you you could you want to see how this person did it you can click uh see inside on any project and then you can see actually the code they used to do it you can see the whole project um so you know here they have the the scratch cat spinning around in this little uh they like with the turn block um and then it when it starts it says click on me uh so anyway uh that's that's just another place that you could get uh inspiration from uh that i wanted to show you um uh yeah uh okay uh there i saw a question about how i want to make a card with a dog in it ah that is another uh another thing you can do you so i showed how you could hover over here and go to the uh go to add another sprite actually maybe i'll start a new project um so you can hover over here and uh and cover over this choose a sprite button and uh choose a sprite this is to show how you could add a dog or some kind of other character to your to your card um so yeah there's all these sprites to choose from uh and if you uh would like to make a card with a dog uh you could scroll on down uh yeah and so you then we we have a dog uh so you could put that in your card you could like this is just an idea but you could have the dog be like i don't know um hi uh friend no i can't spell ignore that hi friend and you know it could say like uh uh like have a great day um so anyway you could you can have the card kind of be a character that's talking with these save blocks but also let's even if you don't know even if you're not sure what kind of character you want in your project one thing i like to do is you can just scroll through and see if any ideas pop up like i don't know if you some kind of thing you see gives you an idea for a card like the gift the gift could be really could be could be really good for a card or have you know i don't know happy birthday or something like that um i just want to put gobo this character in every project so yeah so that's another uh another thing oh you know um i i i see i just uh realized that um that you all can't see my mouse pointer um that's okay i'll just try to i keep trying to illustrate points with my mouse pointer but i'll um i will do that less i'll use my hands i talk with my hands a lot um the uh so anyway that's just another place where you can get an idea um for um you know a random card to make and yeah let's see if we have more questions coming in oh my gosh it's so cool to see all these questions ah um let's see um oh uh someone said uh someone says uh that i lost the cat um let me show you how you can get the cat back so if you uh if you accidentally um uh lost the cat by clicking this delete button you can always get the cat back by going back to choose a sprite and uh you can actually just search for it cat and it's right there you can get it back that way um yeah i'm gonna go through look at a couple more of these questions um uh oh you know someone asked do you have to have an account um you you you don't have to have an account to start making a project but if you want to share your project you'll have to make an account and actually at the end of this live stream for those who want to stick around i or like in the last 10 minutes if you want to stick around for the last 10 minutes of it i'll i'll show you how to make an account so that you can save your project but you don't need to have an account to start making um i try to get to as many of these questions as i can um okay let's see um um the uh i see that the stream bit rate is not so great i am sorry i i think my internet is doing as best as it can but uh it's good to know and we're gonna try to fix that in the future um um uh oh will we be recording someone asks will we be recording this live stream yes we will so this will be available as a video you can watch later and we'll it'll be on our youtube channel uh so yes uh oh my gosh some people made projects oh maybe maybe i'll be able to check those out at the end that's that's so awesome that is so exciting to see ah you all are amazing i i just like i'm at the end of a couple of weeks i can't wait to see all the things people have made i i can't wait and just know everyone's gonna take it in such a different direction uh yeah i think that also these projects are really gonna make people happy i can tell you if one of my friends or like family members made me send me a card like this i would be so happy i yeah so i just you all are making amazing like wonderful stuff um oh my gosh i'm so excited that there are more questions than i expected to get i like wanna answer them all um uh someone asks how are you i'm doing really good i'm really enjoying uh like having this like project making time together i it's i one of my favorite favorite things is like when you can hang out with people but be all working on different things like i don't know one of you is playing the guitar and one of you is making art i just like and so i like i feel like i have this with all of you so i'm doing really good i hope i hope you're doing all right too um uh oh you know someone asks um the how do i make a letter move uh that is a great question uh they're all great questions i said that as if they weren't they're all great questions uh but that's a question i can i can show you the answer to which i'm always excited about um so uh yes uh let me uh let's let's make another project i'm like probably not gonna make one single project during this i'm just i enjoy like showing lots of beginnings of various directions um and so make a new project um and so let's to get let's get a letter by hovering over the choose a sprite button and clicking choose and we'll go to letters um i'm gonna try to talk slower my mom always tells me that i talk too fast and i was gonna try to not talk fast today i shall work on it um that wasn't a question that got sent in that was just me uh saying that to myself realizing that i talk fast um so yes letters uh let us let me get a letter um i will pick a z for zoe i i'm partial um so uh you so there are tons of ways the question was how do you make a letter move i got sidetracked how do you make a letter move um the there are the nice thing is in scratch there's like there are tons of different ways you can make a letter move depending on what you want to do so as i showed earlier you can drag out this move 10 steps blocks block to kind of have it go in whatever direction it's facing and they start by facing like we assume they start by facing uh sideways in this direction so so you can move ten steps um you can there's this block uh go to random position and you can have the letter go to a random position in just one block it's very handy there's also one of my other favorites uh glide to random position and you glide one seconds so that yeah you can definitely tell there's a bit of lag um but the that will make the letter sort of glide to wherever it's going they're sorry glide to some random point on the screen um and uh you can also uh you know uh like make a sprite go um make a sprite go uh you can do this block and get these out of the way i realize my video is here ish so i should put things kind of low um yeah you can you can use this change x by 10 to go that way and then you know change y by 10 to go up so anyway those are just some of the ways of making a letter move all lots of the blocks in this uh category you can kind of experiment with them in different ways um so yeah that's uh that's uh an idea for that um uh let me see if there are other questions coming in oh my gosh uh let's see um um uh someone asks do you have to make a card honestly no i think we wanted to have the prompt of making a card because i think it's like if you can't come up with an idea it's always nice to uh have um to have something to start with otherwise you kind of get like blank scratch project syndrome but if you don't want to make a card you totally don't have to um oh and uh yes there's another question um can you uh add your own audio and uh take a photo yes you can i will show you uh how to do that um so uh this is a really really and you know what actually for one second i saw something about making a question about making the webcam a little bit smaller so i'm going to do that uh really quickly um i hope that's a little bit better uh if i'm just a little up there i can also i guess i could put myself here and that's better let me know in the questions if that's better um so uh yes uh to add your own audio what i did was uh i you can click on the sounds tab right now or in the code tab you can click on the sounds tab and uh hover over this button here that says choose a sound and it has lots of options of ways you can choose a sound but you can actually if you hover up to this one you can click uh record uh okay i think this will work okay i'm gonna record myself saying uh uh uh hello scratchers that's what i'll say hello scratchers okay cool uh so you'll get the joy of hearing me say that again actually yeah i'm gonna hello scratchers yeah so so there you get a recording uh with whatever you said um and you can uh you know you can do another recording and then you also once you have done that recording if you go into back into the code tab you can click on the sound category and uh right here you've got a play sound recording one until done and because basically from here you can choose any of the sounds you uh you have in here in the sounds tab so if you go back here in the code tab um you can pick uh yeah you can pick recording one from there uh and then then you have it in a code scratchers great good to hear me tons of times um actually i'm not sure if you can hear it through my audio i hope you can um but you can also if you wanna have this start when your greeting cart when they click the green flag for your greeting card uh you can just grab the when green flag clicked block and uh and then and then they'll be that'll happen when they click the when they collect the green flag so that is a nice way of involving um uh audio um and uh you can also uh take photos one thing that is really important to mention is that it's important not to post photos of your space or any of the face of anyone you know on scratch uh but you you can you can take a photo of like some random thing i'm trying to think if i have a good thing to show what do so i don't know if any of you uh uh will know this character but this is a character uh named phony from a a book i like and so i have a stuffed animal uh i can i don't know if this is i don't know uh the um you can how i could put a picture of uh this stuffed animal in my project is uh so instead of going to the sound tab or i go to the costumes tab and if i hover over the choose a costume button down here you can go up to the option of camera oh yes okay um we'll get out of the way i think you probably see two of me oh well um uh and then you can take a photo and let me retake it i'll i'll i want to get but um you can take a photo that's wonderful perfect and then save it and then you'll have okay i definitely just told you not to include your face and then i put part of my face so i'm gonna uh take the eraser and uh make the size of the eraser very big and just kind of erase this whole part doesn't need to be perfect even bigger eraser yeah and actually it's really this reminds me it's actually great to just be able to erase the background when you take a photo so i'll erase all that go in with my my fine brush and try to erase around here let's get up here and actually go around like this this is going to be the greatest sprite i can tell uh and actually i'll make the eraser i'm going to set it to like to be really big so i can just get all of this in one video you know if it goes just erase this part and now there you have it a photo beautifully edited by myself um that you can uh make a a sprite from anything around you uh so yes uh i hope you all enjoyed that um uh let me see if you've got other other uh questions coming in um uh oh someone asked do i need to share the project you totally don't need to only if you want to but you can also you feel free to to not you can you know if you you uh the if you have even like if you're living the same house with the person that you were making the project for you actually could show it to them without sharing it um because a lot of us may be in the same houses with the people we care about right now um so uh you can um so anyway yeah you totally don't have to share uh the only if you'd like to um and uh let's see uh let's uh one thing i need to do is i need to make it so that my question the thing where i'm looking at the question the answers is it's not showing them in order so i can't see which ones i've already looked at anyway that's fine uh that's that's why it's just taking me a moment um uh do uh oh someone said uh how do i add words which is a great question um the it so i showed oh you know i'm going to create a new project goodbye voting uh it's nice to have you as a sprite now um it took a second for him to go away still with us uh so uh so i showed so one method the nice thing about scratch there is often so many ways to do something one way is the way i showed with getting letters from here but another way is that you can go to you could you can hover over here but instead of clicking that click paint you could actually paint a new sprite i also saw a question of someone saying can i make my own sprite uh and and this is the place you go to do that too or a place you could go to do that too but uh so you can click uh this text tool in here this t for text and click on the stage and then type in something so what should we have this card say you know what i like the happy international waffle day so but i'm not going to write that much that's too long but happy lawful day could be a pretty fabulous card i would like to get um so yeah you can like type text in there uh and and yeah and you can change the color of it uh oh you know what i'm going to make it a brown color which i always do by setting the color to nine is really good for making like a brown and then play around with the saturation and the brightness brown for waffles obviously and syrup and chocolate and um and then you can um you can draw you can make that you can make it bigger there um so yeah yes that is that is another great way of adding text and of course you can always add text i've shown this already but just in case you haven't seen it um you can another another way that's quite easy of adding text to a project of course it's it it disappears once the character finishes saying it but it's to have the character say you know uh the happy waffle yeah happy waffle day okay so so so that can be another way of adding text and and you know it's it's sort of that's super easy to do um so uh let me look and see uh more questions if there's okay um someone says how about a backdrop uh yes let me show you how to add a backdrop to your project um so if you go to the um if you if you uh hover over this button like we hovered over the sprite button if you hover over here uh let's choose a backdrop button you can uh click choose and uh then you have all these um all these backdrops you can choose from uh you know have your card be set against all these different kinds of places in these different categories um and like the you know all that and actually one of my favorite uh ones to use for cards is we have this patterns uh category and these are these are great for just about any card uh they're they're i love this one uh this is a cute little card i got going um uh so um anyway uh that's that's one way of adding a backdrop you can also um draw your own backdrop click paint um and you know i maybe like i'll i'll i like to sometimes create backdrops by creating a couple of like different rectangles with this rectangle tool because the scratch vector mode is really good for creating shapes so like i could draw make a blue rectangle and that'll be a sky i might make the sky a little bit lighter and then i can also uh make a green color and make a uh sort of a grass section of the background so anyway that's one that's honestly one of my favorite super quick ways to make a backdrop is a rectangle that's kind of most of the most of the stage that is the the whatever's i don't know like in the background and then something in the front that's like the ground anyway uh so yes that's that's those are some ways of adding a backdrop um let me see more questions um um oh this is a a great question oh my gosh i wish i had time to answer all of these there are so many good ones someone asks um what if the sprite you want doesn't have a certain costume this is a really really good question um so you know the the you can look at um at uh um you can open up to look at sprites um say you want to pick the you see something that catches your eye uh like the frog say and um and the frog uh actually if you go to the costumes tab it doesn't have more than one costume uh you can uh click duplicate on the costume that's there or one of the costumes that's there and edit it to you know be different so so you could kind of create another costume for it so you can in you can grab on a shape and like uh stretch it out or uh you could i like uh you could stretch it out this way um so you can so that's one way is you can change um change and now you have now you do yeah you have these two costumes for the frog now that i don't know that probably wasn't what you wanted to do but i think that that's kind of the the um uh one of the the basic kind of what i would it's hard to describe the basic advice for making a different costume is for a character doesn't have a costume is see if you can make it and and you can also uh you know you can if i let's say you can you can take parts of one costume and put them in another so say i wanted to the frog to have a basketball uh i could take uh add this character andy who has a basketball and then i could go to andy's costume and then actually here it's really nice some of the the the sprites in scratch they're they're the objects are kind of grouped together so this basketball is made up of a few shapes but it's actually grouped together so i can go into i've gone into andy's costume and i can copy this and then i can go into the frog i don't know why this card needed a basketball playing frog but you know what it does uh and i can then once i've gone into the frog's costume i can click paste and now i have the basketball with the frog so just like i always wanted so uh so that's that is another way is like say um one character has a thing you want but you actually want that in a different character this can be a good way of doing it um in probably five or six minutes this is literally so fun answering your questions so i i am sad that we're gonna have to end this but it's a good thing we will have more live streams uh um the uh oh my gosh it's so awesome seeing all the all the questions um uh what was i gonna say you um we anyway in like five minutes i will start uh wrapping up and showing you how to make a um make an account if you want to and then showing you how you can add your project to the studio if you want to do that but i have five more minutes i'll answer a couple more questions let's see um looking at them oh okay see people saying i'm done oh my gosh i can't wait to see the project uh uh yeah uh uh i'll get to that in a second um um i'm just looking for there's the this this uh is just sorry it's loading only the first bunch of questions that were answered so i'm just trying to get to the to the to the ones that were answered more recently um oh my gosh someone said i made you waffles i can't wait to see that oh my goodness uh oh someone asked how do we send our card to a loved one um that's a really good question i don't know i will show you that in a moment uh and you know maybe maybe i should start showing that now um yeah uh the let me uh try to think what order to do these things in um i want to show you how to make accounts and i want to show you how to share um the let's so if you if you already have an account and let's say you made uh this project you can copy this link of the project you know hit the copy on your computer and then send that link to the person or if as i mentioned if you're in the same house as them you could just call them over and be like hey come over here don't say hey that sounds a little rude uh hello my loved one i have something to show you um and you just can you can you can even click here to click full screen on the project and actually this would work even if the project isn't shared you can you can still do that um click full screen and hit play or tell them to click on the letters as i think you do in this one or tell them to click on the cat or whatever it is um but yeah if you if you uh if you have shared it then this link is what you can use um the uh um and you know uh i'll i'll start i'll start wrapping up and then show how to make accounts for those who who don't have an account yet um you all this was so fun i it is so fun watching the questions come in and seeing all the things you're saying and i am i've been hearing all these people that they're adding to the studio i am so excited to look at that studio oh my goodness it literally as soon as this is over i'm just gonna look at that um uh yeah thank you so much for joining it has been so much fun to have you the the uh you know normally we probably could fill up the hour but i really want to show making accounts for people in case you don't have an account um uh at the beginning of the next uh live stream which there will definitely be more of these um uh the it will i think i think i could say this with certainty it will be next week uh the at the beginning on the live stream i'll take a few moments to just look into the studio and uh check out all the stuff people have shared uh so uh yeah that that uh that look forward to that at the beginning of next live stream we will look at uh the projects that were made uh this week and then next week we will have a new prompt um and uh yeah you know keep some if you keep submitting questions to this forum and you can we'll still be reading them and you can tell us if how how often would you like to do these live streams like what worked what didn't work love to hear because you know i'm in my house i'm here i want to make these um so um anyway next time look forward to uh checking out some of the projects that were made this week and then we'll have a new prompt to do this again together uh yeah i thank you so much for coming and hanging out this has seriously been like the highlight of my week um uh and you are now feel free to stick around uh i am just going to be showing how to make an account in case you uh don't have one so yes if you don't have a scratch account and you would like to share this project uh here is how you can do that so uh uh let me uh so there's this project i made that is honestly it speaks for itself it's quite that's that's this is it's perfection uh the you so and say you want to uh you want to create an account so you can save this project to your account um you know what let me just mention you can also if you don't want to make an account but you do want to save your project you can click file and click save to your computer so you always have you can do that and you can use the scratch desktop editor but if you do want to make an account uh and you know and the link to that is sorry the link to the scratch desktop editor is uh scratch.mit.edu download which i don't expect you to remember from me saying it but i'll put it in the description um so anyway but if you want to save this project on your account click this button join scratch and you can also i should mention you can also just click on that button from the scratch home page from where wherever you do it from if you've made a project it'll save that project to your account so i can also click on it from here um and and then this uh this form will pop up um you can create a username it's important to mention that you shouldn't create a username that has your real name in it in any way um for privacy so you know you could be like rainbow um uh i'm gonna look at the most recent animal that i saw mentioned in the cat okay that was the most that's the animal that i just happened to see in the questions rainbow cat uh i don't know a bunch of numbers um make a password write down somewhere so you remember it i'm just going to type in something random uh and you know don't show that um that's not a very good password you should do a better password than that but uh and then you know you can walk through the form fill it out oh i i guess i won't fill out the whole thing but um you you fill it out at the end uh it will um switch back to at the end uh it will take you to you will send you you will put in an email put in an email address and then you uh you'll have to to be able to share and this is important uh you have to go to your email and uh open up that open up an email that you'll get from scratch team and click on the link to uh to confirm your account and once you can confirm your account in that email then you'll be able to share your project and now let me show you what sharing a project and adding to a studio looks like uh i will uh log in to um my scratch account um just a moment while i do that wifi is a bit slow um or my wifi is not slow i'm just live streaming uh so just logging in um uh and uh let me go i'm just logging into my account and then like creating a random project slow um that's fine um okay let me show you the screen again so i've logged into my account and now i have uh this uh project um and uh if i i i have already confirmed my account i'll call this uh like hi friend um and uh the you can um wait i just realized that i'm about to share a scratch scratch project uh to everyone let me let me actually uh i want to save really quickly i want to actually say share my my happy waffle day project um because it's happy waffle today how could you not um um sorry figuring this all out thank you for bearing with me i just really want to share this wonderful day project with the world um so and i will add a green flag on top to get it all ready and um call this happy waffle day and then uh then uh you can click share and let me sit out and you know what add a uh title description so i'll say um uh happy waffle day um uh click the green flag and then uh then there's this last question of how do you uh share to a studio uh and i'll show you how to do that so in the link below in the description of this video um you can uh you can see this um let me get the you can get to this um uh create a long studio which oh my gosh there are so many brushes i'm so happy uh so um you can go and now anyone can add projects to the studio so what you can do is go to um go to uh click add projects and then copy the link of your of your scratch project that you made copy that and add it there and now it's in the studio so everyone can see um and uh yeah that's that's uh basically um how how and and once you do that everyone else from this stream can see your project um and you know i i know you will all be so lovely uh leaving like wonderful constructive comments on each other's projects uh i'm very excited to see the like how we all support each other in this time uh the um i'm so excited to look at the projects and check them all out um the uh and um you know that's that is mostly uh what i wanted to show if i went fast through that explanation um i i i'm sorry i'm going to try to speak slower they need to work on that um but you can always this video will be available to watch later so you can rewind that part of it um and uh yeah i'm trying to remember if there's any other uh important things uh to tell you um yeah uh next week we will uh definitely uh be doing a live stream again um uh we will keep you posted on uh twitter and maybe i'll also make a post on our youtube uh about when the time is um of the next live stream it will definitely be next week um the yeah we'll we'll look at the studio at the beginning of next week's live stream uh the um uh you can keep asking questions in that form we'll keep looking at them uh and you can you know give suggestions on how this went uh you know how does this format work um uh you know we're we're we are all of us everywhere figuring out
