for those who don't know me I'm Mitch Resnik also known as M reses on Scratch and I head up the scratch team here at MIT it's just wonderful to be surrounded by so many people who have done so much to help spread the ideas and the spirit of scratch around the world so it's just great having you all here it's hard for me to you know you know believe that it's already the fifth scratch conference we've had here at MIT uh back in 2007 just a year after we 2008 a year after we launched scratch Karen brenon and I organized the first conference and we've been doing them every other year here at MIT since in between years others in Barcelona and Amsterdam other places of organized scratch conferences it's been great to see how it's just grown and grown over the years as scratch itself has grown and grown over the years and I just love the way that these conferences bring together people from so many different back backgrounds and interests I think at this year's conference we have people from 25 different countries around the world actually maybe people from outside the United States could stand up for a moment just to see so it's great to have so many people coming from around the world but there you know also people I think the crowd the people coming they also represent working in schools but also working outside of schools people working with very young children up to people working with college students and Beyond you know people working across different disciplines connecting together uh computer science and technology and art education and design so connecting together all those different disciplines uh so it's just been wonderful to see the wide range of different ways that people are connecting with scratch and coming together but I think one thing that also is wonderful to despite the very different backgrounds and interests people have I think people come here you know sharing some common values and common vision and we see people coming here dedicated to helping young people around the world learning to think creatively and reason systematically and work collaboratively dedicated to helping young people not only develop their thinking but also develop their voice so they can express themselves in the world and and developing their identity so they see themselves as someone who can be an active participant and contributor you know to the world so it's just you know wonderful to see all the ways that people come together around these shared ideas the conference also brings together some longtime members of the scratch Community there's some of you who've been using scratch for almost a decade now I know others are just getting started some have been to many scratch conferences before I know for some of you are was talking last night at the reception I know it's the first conference for some actually I'd just be interested for for how many of you if it's your first scratch conference could you stand up right so you know we want to welcome all of you for coming for the first time although I know I met some people where it's their first scratch conference but they've been using scratch for a long time but I hope that we all find ways for those of you who' have been at other scratch conferences Reach Out connect you know with others who are here for the first time we've tried to design this as a very participatory conference you know over the next few days there'll be you know HandsOn workshops and interactive panels and posters and demos where you can go up and talk to people who are developing things around scratch you have the chance to meet all different you know people not just Educators but developers who are developing extensions to scratch or variance to scratch uh and also researchers who are studying the ways young people are learning with scratch uh so I hope you'll take this as a chance to meet other people uh to share ideas to learn with and from one another and in that Spirit maybe we'll just get started by learning a little about your neighbors I'd like if you can just take a couple minutes and maybe share with your neighbors a scratch memory from the past year if you've just getting started talk about how you found out about scratch but share a scratch memory with the people sitting around you for a moment or two e for for okay are you I always hate breaking up act of conversation so as I said I always feel bad breaking up such you know active conversation but we did organize the conference there'll be lots of opportunity for conversation there's lots of time in between the sessions and I think this type of interaction is exactly what we hope will fill the next few days so since you had a chance to share some of your scratch memories from the past year I thought I would share a couple of my scratch memories you know from the past year uh one a bunch of the memories are associated with the annual event that we do called scratch day as you know a number of years ago we started having a scratch day here at MIT uh but then started encouraging other people to run their own scratch Day events around the world and every year it's grown and grown this year there were 659 events in 74 countries in May when we had scratch day actually may just raise hands how many people were involved in a scratch day so it's great to see so many people and hope we can continue to spread that and grow it in years ahead and it was great as we see just people sharing their ideas about scratch day from all over the world you know from Indonesia China Oman and different people all having different types of scratch days again I think in the spirit of scratch and in the spirit of the theme of this conference with many paths many styles it's not a cookie cutter every scratch day around the world is exactly the same they share in spirit but we love seeing how different places around the world all have their own put their own stamp on scratch day uh and if we look at other places from Japan Brazil Rwanda all around the world some many different people finding different ways of bringing young people Educators others together to work together on scratch share ideas about scratch actually the group that did the Rwanda scratch day also produced a video that was one of my most memorable videos from the year so in addition to scratch day they were actively participating in Africa code week and they posted this video about some of their participation using scratch during Africa code week fore and again we saw other videos and photos from around the world of people sharing the spirit and supporting young people growing up as creative learners for me though a lot of the strongest memories I have of the year are from Individual scratchers and seeing how you know how how scratch has entered their lives so I want to share with you a few quotes that we got we get lots of mail from scratches around the world I thought I'd share with you quotes from a few messages that we receiv received this year from young people using scratch here's one scratch has become part of my life every morning I wake up and I immediately think how can I improve with scratch my friends and family don't quite understand the beauty of this website but I do it's art music games and animation compressed into visual coding blocks and that in my humble opinion is pretty amazing so this idea how can I improve with scratch the idea it's not just how I can make a project but saying this isign I can sort of continue to improve with in ways I can keep learning from here's another quote scratch has made such a huge impact on my life ever since I started is piie 31415 n265 two years ago I'm a ninth grader I still use it even though I could easily switch to writing out my code it's usually not even about the code the animations the games it's all about the community and again that's something we hear from so many scratchers around the world they start out to express themselves gring projects but stay for the community to become part of the community I think I was especially happy that someone who thought to create a username piy 31415 9 got so connected with the community because sometimes there's a feeling if someone who get started that would just be you know focused on you know the writing the project but so nice to see everyone getting involved in the community and one more quote that I'll share thank you so much for everything scratch has done for me scratch really is an amazing Community some things can be annoying and scratch could use a lot of improvement but you're getting there scratch is a huge part of my life I'll say 60% so the same way that scratchers wake up every morning think how they can improve a scratch we on the scratch team also think how we can improve scratch and it's good to get some encouragement you know that that we're getting there so it's nice to hear that and if we keep doing it maybe you'll get to 65% next year so but again so it's great to hear from scratches but of course a main way that we interact with scratches is through the projects that they share on the scratch website to make every day now there's more than 20,000 projects shared on the scratch website from young people around the world actually many more than that are created that's the number that are shared every day for other people to see and to interact with so that's more than 100,000 projects every week you know more than six million projects over the past year uh and you know it's been so exciting for us to see and so inspiring for us to see all the different ways that young people are using scratch and there are many projects that sort of capture our attention and just Delight us and you know make and and also give us ideas of how we can continue to grow and evolve scratch over the past year one project that really stood out to us was a project by a member of the scratch Community bubble 103 and this came across in the past year was a project called color divide and actually became a series of projects it started out the first one that we saw was a trailer for a series of projects that she was planning to work on so let me show you the trailer project that that she you know that she created and that caught our attention welcome to Aurora land of color and Magic every child at the age of 12 faces the test to determine their magical strength and their color rank but all is not as it seems this test means everything to me I can't fail what if I don't get a color I don't want a color anyways I'm I'm going to fail the test but banishment haven't you ever wondered what's out there I mean there's got to be something I got close to the gates once and I saw something a boy I hate living in this place The Magicians are dictat they tore my family apart they destroyed they destroyed my home and burned my mother together we'll fail this test together let's see what you made of then so we love this project it's not just that we click the love it button on scratch we really love this project and we were so happy when actually we were organizing the conference and the creator of this project submitt a proposal so I'm very happy that she's here with us today today and I want to invite Tyran also known as bubble 103 to come up on stage to to talk a little bit about her experiences D it's great having you here uh and to to be able to share your project and more people to see it so I thought maybe it would be great to to have F hear a little bit more about some of went into how you got the ideas for this project and the process of working on this project I know this was just a trailer and then you uh got you engaged lots of other people from the community to work with you on the projects that led from it um so the trailer kind of started out as a collaboration well the story was a collaboration um I was actually role playing with these like five other scratches that I'd kind of just met in the community and we started coming up with this story called the color divide where they'd be well the trailer and um I wasn't planning on like making a project for it we were just we were just having fun role playing and like getting to know each other still like friends all of them um but then I I sort of got like struck by inspiration and I was like I need to animate this I I hadn't ever animated in scratch or animated all before but that didn't matter because I was inspired um and I'd been working with the scratch environment for long enough that I I kind of felt comfortable enough to just try it but you you start you did start with scratch around five years ago so right yeah so it's it's been a while um and then I I I wasn't planning on kind of sharing this trailer on scratch at first I was kind of like well I don't know I've never made something like this before but I mean I kind of just shared it and I was like um and then what was the reaction like when you shared it wow um I mean I've I've always got a lot of support you know from the scratch community and and I I was so like overwhelmed with the response and you know at first I wasn't kind of I didn't really think about oh let's make an animated series I was kind of just like oh I've got these images in my head and a story I'm inspired by and scratches that I kind of want to share um this with but then you know other scratches in the community would come to me they' be like bubble bubble you need to make this a series I'm like okay I'd never done that before but from them kind of believing in me and supporting me I I guess I kind of started to believe in my myself and I was like you know what I haven't make an animated series don't know what I'm doing but and then you put out a call to ask other people to help in developing characters and voices yes um well at first I I was kind of kind of kind of I was I was doing it all myself like I did most of the voicing in the first episode but I mean a lot of people were really offering to help and so I I started to get more and more people involved you know it felt less like you know something I was making something that we were making together you know um that was that was great yeah and then actually maybe just you play a little bit of then the next one the the first installment episode of the series uh is here well we'll just play a short bit of this and then maybe can talk a little bit about or the how people collaborated around it welcome to Aurora my home some call it the city of color and Magic it's great we all know our place here you see we're all ranked based on our magical ability if you're not so good at Magic that's a level red the most powerful of Violet if you're not strong enough to get even a red you're banished to outside Aurora to the Wilderness so I mean I can so I can see here that he used 598 assets and has 413 scripts so clearly a lot of work went into this project yeah and I also see if if I look down on the notes and credits and it's great that you give lots of notes and credits we always encourage members of the community so you have a long list of all the people who help design characters and voice them and who conceive things but maybe you can say a little bit more about how you all collaborated on this yeah so I ended up with this impressive credits list um so one of the things after I released the trailer like a lot of scratches were kind of um well since it started from a role play and each of the characters were designed by the kind of five of us who started the story a lot of other scratchers were like I want to be in this too I want to make a character for this which was so cool I was so excited for me exciting for me and uh so I wanted to have a a way for like all of us to kind of be involved in it so what I did was so in the episode there's like a lot of kind of faces like in the scenery and characters there and all of those were designed by other scratches so they'd come to me with their design or a drawing they've made and then I just redraw it and put it in and they not their name in the notes and credits I mean also the music is um I I don't something that's important to me is all the music I use is by other scratches because I'm so inspired by like way scratches um they share like the music they've made on scratch specifically for other scratches to use in their projects yeah I see it's clearly it became very popular in the community we see that about 15,000 people watched it and of those 20 almost 2,800 people loved it so uh maybe you can say a little bit about uh the storyline you know about the color divide and why that had a special meaning for you or and and how you thought about that I mean at first it was you know the kind of collaborative story and the the sort of setting for it was made by the other scratcher who created the role play but I mean since then that I've been working with it and um it it's taken on like so much more meaning for me and I'm only really understanding now why I was so drawn to it at first um so the the kind of main message that I'm doing from it is that you know Society will oh okay now it gets all deep so um so the one kind of thing that Society is putting so much weight on um and saying well to be a good person you have to be this one thing you know people are so much more than that you can be so much more than that um you know okaye of this it's like magic but I mean it's so many other things um in our world you know and I mean that's May yeah a special meaning from where you grow up maybe yes especially since um so I'm from South Africa so um I've grown up kind of still seeing the kind of scars that have been left by a parted like in my country um so like each character is kind of inspired by a the way different people kind of reacted to it and the kind of things I'm still seeing now so like uh Leia the one who was talking there she's the one who's feeling like kind of gut feel like oh something's not right here but I'm too afraid to challenge it the other um one Fage the one with the the fire in the eyes how tragic story and everything it took me ages to animate um she's the one who's you been oppressed and she's got nothing to lose so she's just like screw it I'm going to rebel and stuff and then I mean lots of other characters have specific messages as well about the importance of um fighting for something instead of just against it you know and building instead of kind of breaking something that stuff that's great maybe you can say a little bit so as you said you started working on this in the past year you've been working on this you started around five years ago maybe you can say a little bit about what attracted you to scratch and what is it that kept you coming to scratch and how that's evolved over time so I was introduced to scratch um just like one lesson um at school and we were kind of we were kind of just told like put this block here do this do this which I didn't find that exciting but so I went home I went home like okay this this thing called scratch all right so I went in and I started messing around with it um I couldn't really get it to do what I wanted it to but the thing I was so entranced by was like um the kind of magic of doing some making something and then the computer like does it like scratch cat moved I'm a computer genius guys so I kept coming back to kind of feel that kind of magic of like playing around um and making things happen and you know most of the time it didn't do what I was expecting at all and that that was the best part I mean especially as someone who's always like being afraid of of getting something wrong and making mistakes it was so like freeing to be in a space where making mistakes is the best thing you can do and but I mean I got even more like kind of sucked into scratch when I found the scratch online community which is just yeah they um they're they're probably the reason I'm actually like able to be not nervous right now as they they all know that I'm here at the scratch C they're like bubble you're going to do great I'm just like thank you guys they're so supportive and I mean it's a community that's kind of interacting on a different level you know where we're all working together as content creators um so when we when we look at each other's projects we're not taking it like at face value like well I I don't know what to say man this is this animation it's not quite what Disney did or whatever it's it's like you can see exactly how they made it and it's and so inspiring so inspiring maybe we can take a look at some other projects that you did in the past as as I looked at your projects so and there's a wide variety one thing that again I always like first of all look at the website overall and also with individual scratches it always I get excited when I see that people have done a wide variety of projects because I think that's what we' hope that people could express themselves in so many different ways so here was one that I saw they did there was a water cycle game where if you do this it's a type of simulation where I can get to move the cloud and I bar move it over here to rain on the desert but I didn't I there wasn't enough I didn't get enough water from the ocean there may you can tell the story around this well um so I you know I started scratch at school um and then I I kind of started to experiment with using it in school like for when we did projects so I don't know we were supposed to design a computer game and write about it I didn't really want to do that so I just made it instead I have to keep working so it doesn't die off um and then like a few of the teachers were like okay this is a scratch thing and this kid's doing things all right oh so is it is it possible to make like a like a a thing that teaches people stuff and I was like uh yeah I think so cool um so then I kind of messed around a bit and made this thing it's so weird seeing CU I haven't looked at it in like a year or something um um it didn't it didn't run on the school computers though cuz uh we we didn't have very good internet or the computers are the these brick things like this big so yeah he our teacher didn't really see it but it was fun making it well it looks like you're playing out something you've been learning about in school and making it come to life but this idea you said about using scratch help other people learn things I know that's something else that has been part of what you've done on scratch you had mentioned me tried to you set up like to try to have people Mentor each other on scratch yeah that was um I I wanted to so when I don't know I love teaching I love sharing like knowledge I mean think that's a thing that is a lot in the scratch Community is sharing ideas like and knowledge not just projects so um I wanted to make a thing where I'd be able to teach new scratches all the things that I was confused about when I was a new scratcher but I wanted it to be like a kind of mentoring like oneonone thing so I came up with this whole idea and I put this whole thing together where I'd make a like a project um which would teach kind of Concepts um and then walk the scratcher through making a kind of simple project using those Concepts CU I thought that was kind of the best way to learn which is the way I kind of did it didn't really work out that well because that time in South Africa um the electric was really messed up lots of drama and we kept getting load shedding so three times a day electricity is gone I'm just like I'm done it's not working but I learn I learned a lot from that but then you started making individual projects to help explain how to do some things yes so the mentoring thing didn't work so I was like you know I kind of want to make um so I didn't want to do something that with so high maintenance but I still wanted to share these Concepts um that I wanted to teach so I started making a few tutorials like here's one where it was about using the Vector editor and the paint editor and know your in your projects you make great use of the vector editor Vector editor I'm like I'm such a weird fangle I like Fango over Vector it's amazing well it made us really have to go when we did scratch 2.0 it was a lot of work to add Vector editing in addition to bitmap and sometimes you thought should we really be doing this so it that makes us feel happy when scratchers are so happy with it so maybe you can just say a little bit I'm just going to very quickly uh page through this this is a very long tutorial that starts out explaining the different parts of the vector editor but then how to make use of it I don't know if you can just say some things about as I just page through very quickly yeah so um the main thing that I wanted to focus on besides the just the tools was teaching the kind of Concepts um i' you know I'd seen a lot of tutorials um where they where scratcher would kind of teach like how to do a specific thing but for me I really wanted to focus on the kind of concepts for me the biggest concept to kind of grasp in Vector was that you're working with shapes instead of like a a flat image so I I wanted to find a way to kind of explain that to scratches so again um I I like the kind of learning where you're walking someone through making something and then explaining Concepts as you go cuz when you're working you're walking someone through making something like these eyes um you understand like why am I learning this concept um and kind of showing them how to apply it that was the kind of motivation for this yeah this is I love drawing eyes so that that was my thing but it's great start seeing the process cuz you know some we just see final products of things so for me I sort of love I sort of can feel you going through it as I do this so it's great to see the process we also did other types I noticed one other tutorial this was more on the creating images we had another one called you got to love variables so make can say about this um so that was the one that I did for this like mentoring thing so I kind of uh edited it to make it stand alone is like a tutorial um I do this because uh I love variables vector and variables are like my thing I mean also it had like a lot of meaning to me because that was the one concept that I struggled with the most when I was starting scratch was most abstract kind of thing um so I I wanted to kind of share that with scratches you know and I mean all the kind of analogies I lose I I lose I can't words right now all the analogies I use are the ones that have like helped helped me to kind of understand it like how a variable is a is like a box for like shoving information in and then I have like the variables like almost like talking to the and stuff so maybe can you share a little bit now some of your future plans of I know there's still more work on the color device series but other things that you think you might be working on or both on scratch or how this might be influencing other things you're thinking about I have so many plans like I'll wake up in the middle of the night I have to have like my Sketchbook and everything next to me I'm like oh what if I make this thing in scratch so write it down whatever um so I mean some of the main things I'm thinking about you know besides color divide because that's happening I'm continuing that um I I want to do well I want to do kind of projects with like where I'm more experimenting with programming more because I feel like I've kind of settled into a bit of a rhythm with color div ey doing the same kind of things I was like I want to get back into experimenting I want to make like a maybe a story game or something and then other things there's a lot of stuff I want to do like with the community so um they kind of vag ideas one of them I call like doodling with code which is kind of I don't know like an initiative thing um kind of capturing like like celebrating that kind of magic of like first like playing around with something you know just having room to just experiment and have fun I haven't figured out the details yet but it's happening sometime I'll figure it out great well we all look forward to see it because we've been so inspired and excited by seeing the things you've done and I'm sure we'll continue to you know learn more as as you continue to contribute to the community so I want to thank you for all your contributions it's been great having you here thank you so originally with this opening keynote after talking about some of our favorite memories from the past year we were going to move on to looking ahead and and I was going to be joined by some other members of the scratch team because there are lots of new things that we're planning for Scratch for the year and the years ahead uh things about new resources we're coming with a a set of 10 thematic packages of activities to have new Pathways into scratch and we're introducing we're just introducing Now teacher accounts to help you know teachers you glad and we're also starting to work on a next generation of scratch you know right now we're on the second generation scratch 2. which moves scratch online and we're starting to work on a next generation of scratch which will be much more friendly for mobile devices we're also doing more of connecting it to the physical world and we want to share all those things with you and there'll be more time through the conference in the conference there'll be session both sessions and posters about all of those things so it'll be a chance for you to learn more about the teacher accounts and the scratch 3.0 and individual sessions we also have a what's next session on Saturday but we changed plans because instead of looking ahead we did decide it would be right to look back and give a tribute to a person and I get emotional this so I hope you'll bear with me you know to to spend some time talking about person who had a huge huge influence on Scratch and that's sour paper I think you know you know sour would just touched so many people in so many ways around the world through his work and engaging us and rethinking you know the ways that we think about learning and children and Technology um you know through the work he did with the logo programming language the first real programming language for kids which was a direct inspiration for scratch but you know more generally his ideas have sort of sparked many so many of the things that we've been doing with scratch uh so uh it felt it would be good to sort of spend some time reflecting on CMR I was you know so fortunate and so lucky to be able to work closely with seamour for many years to have him as a mentor and as a colleague and friend I know there other people in the audience too work very very closely with Seymour from the early days from the early days when he was first inventing you know with had a team here at MIT working on the original logo which actually was like this year's like the 50th anniversary of logo start is is right now and you know he worked very closely with Cynthia Solomon who you know was there a close collaborator from the very very beginning and did the the the the the project wrote The Paper 20 things to do with the computer and I know there are other people here from the original logo effort who both who did work in schools trying out the initial versions you know on these you know big expensive computers with kids to see what was possible uh and then wrote about it and know know Brian Harvey is here and Dan and Molly watt Michael Temple there's whole collection of people who are from the early days Brian Silverman who is one of the se's closest collaborators and led the implementation and develop of logo and spreading it to the world through the work he did logo computer systems incorporated and elsewhere we have some of Seymour's students here like Claud ARA who work closely and continue to spread Seymour's ideas uh actually I'm really happy that Seymour's daughter Artemis is also here so for you know for some of us you know we work so closely with Seymour and uh but I know for many of you you know as many as many of you know seamour had a very bad accident 10 years ago uh it was you know he was hit by a motorbike in in Hanoi and had and never never fully recovered so he hasn't been able to be a full participant in the last 10 years so many people here you know really have never directly interacted with Seymour some of you who are new to this might not know much about seamour at all so especially for for those I want to spend some time talking about Seymour's contributions and some of the ways in which Seymour's ideas and his work directly influenced us with scratch and continue to directly influence us with scratch I want to start I was going to show a video because I want you to sort of you know at least hear see where talking is important um this a I'm G to show a video that was made just in this past year was made by The Lego company uh in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the Lego company's collabor ation with the media lab was you know Lego 30 years ago approached Seymour because they saw what he was you know they they were inspired by his ideas about children and learning and they thought there'd be a good connection and indeed there was uh so seamour became seamour the Lego company then became a close collaborator seamour became the first Lego Professor at MIT they endowed a professorship uh and we've worked together in in wonderful ways over the years uh I have the great honor to when see became an ameritus Professor they uh renamed the chair in Seymour's honor the Lego poer Professor uh so actually I'm so very honored now to be the Lego paper Professor which feels so right because in some ways the two biggest influences of my life my PRI are paper and Lego and in some ways some two of the biggest influences on scratch so I thought it' be nice to show this video it's around seven minute video that talks about the 30 years for those who have never bit the media lab it also tells you a little about the introduction to the media lab but more important an introduction to seamour and his ideas and how it influenced the the interaction and collaboration with the Lego company but then I want to talk more about how we built on those ideas in in our work on scratch the great thing about the computer is that it can bring together in one experience the aesthetic the personal the bodily the analytic the mathematical the abstract all these things happen in one combined integrated experience in 1984 there was a television program in the Danish television called talking turtle and I happen to watch that and there was this charismatic person there telling about what children could do with computers that guy was Simo papot what we really have to think about is what produces involvement engagement what grabs the individual what interested me was Simo Papa's view on children and how they can learn through experimentation how they can learn through play education has very little to do with explanation it has to do with engagement with falling in love with the material I was absolutely fascinated and I said go and get contact with uh with him we have to talk to him in 1984 I was already working with Seymour poer helping to connect Lego bricks to the computer so the children could control their Lego constructions from the computer then out of the blue SE more got a letter from Top Executives at The Lego company Seymour whose life's work was children and learning um met keld whose life work was children and the two of them really hit it off we started working together and that's lasted now more than 30 years the MIT media lab has 25 different research groups doing all different types of creative Innovative work in my work I combine arts and crafts with electronics to create artistic expressive pieces the city scope platform was developed to allow people to engage with Urban Planet this is the first device ever to make it easier for people to walk the researchers and students here at the meab they're constantly experimenting trying new things building complex structures from simpler Parts they're doing it in a Lego spirit my own group is called the lifelong kindergarten group where we focus on designing new technologies and activities to engage people in Creative Learning experiences a big part of our collaboration with the Lego company is sharing ideas we explore technology and how it can impact the human potential if from our perspective primarily through play the Micky miy is a little circuit board we invented here that lets kids transform anything in their world into a controller for Gam or music one of the things that we always talk about is we want to solve big challenges and big problems and in order to do that you have to be Innovative and I think to be Innovative you need people who are sort of not afraid to try new things make mistakes so that means we need to help children become creative thinkers the goal of these creative workshops is really to give children an opportunity to come up with their own ideas imagine something and then figure out how to design it we should still keep this plate but take this they need to be constantly exploring experimenting work oh my God through natural Discovery by testing things by tinkering by experimenting by creating they're using Lego motors and sensors then if it doesn't work the way they want they start revising it so you have to kind of adjust the motor power so they it actually has enough power to knock the knights off so they're really learning through having a goal having imagining something and then bringing it to life so rather than just thinking of the computer of something that I think what am I supposed to do they start thinking what do I want to do with it they start getting new ideas the children are learning to program they're learning about motion above all they're learning the scientific knowledge is not something separate from their passion for toys after a couple of years of cooperation it crystallized that we really want to make a set for the schools we worked for several years on designing prototypes testing out with children in classrooms when the elevator comes up it'll reverse the direction and call elevator again IED up now get it we could in 1988 Market the first product that had come out of the coroporation which was called Lego TC logo and as elect elonics got smaller and lighter and cheaper we realized we could build the electronics of the computer directly into a Lego brick SEO at a point in time probably maybe in the early '90s started talking about the intelligent break I remember many occasions walking into Kell's office with the latest prototype that we've developed at MIT and you'd see The Gleam in Kell's eyes we would start talking about it but he would immediately want to get his hands on the Prototype we ultimately came up with the final version that The Lego company came out with in 1998 as LEGO Mindstorms one thing that surprised us was that even though we designed it primarily for children initially a lot of the sales were to adults they would build into robots as part of robot competitions they would build piano playing robots they would walk on the piano keyboard and play plant watering robots that would test out when the soil was dry dancing robots would dance to different music it just opened up all sorts of new Creative Design possibilities for children around the world we can't say what children will need in the future adults shouldn't be saying what children ought to learn but I think we can say something about how children should be learning everyone should be able to learn to express their ideas with the computer and that's what coding is all about when you say coding people think of like numbers that are super complicated and stuff that even I don't understand but like scratch is much easier scratch is uh an visual programming language for kids that we developed here these these elements on the screen actually look like Lego blocks and you snap them together and very quickly you can make things start happening programming is like playing with Lego bricks is the same structured and very creative process you know that it can be done it's just a question of how you find the way that is exactly the same as your Lego experience it's constrained in a way that's really easy for kids to to get started but it's openended so people can build anything it tells us the legal idea is alive in the physical world but it's very much alive in the digital world and that's highly inspirational for us as I think about the future of our relationship with the Lego company is not just about bringing products to the world but bringing change to the world we're always thinking of Seymour's vision of a world where children can take control of their own learning to use the materials around them to explore world to understand the world in new ways and to understand themselves in new ways we think the approach of the media lab to learning is the way of the future and that's why we take so much inspiration from this partnership because we think it really defines how education but also informal learning should happen in society the fact that we share these values about creativity imagination play and learning belongs together that is something that has kept us together for all these years this is where it leads to a fundamental change in the nature of the learning so I want to spend a few minutes just reflecting on some of the ideas that at least I took away from Seymour and the ways that they've influenced us as we've sort brought worked on Scratch and other projects and as difficult as might be I sort of boiled it down I sort of grabbed six phrases uh that I thought sort of captured some of the spirit of things that I learned from Seymour and so I want to talk a little about those so the first you know Seymour in talking about his approach to learning he used the term constructionism and that grew out of seamour had worked with Jean P the great sort epistem ologist and philosopher and psychologist in Switzerland uh in understand children's learning and P he learned swh learned from P about the way that children actively build up their knowledge structures through their interactions in the world and what seem we layered on top of that was that one of the best ways for help kids to build up that knowledge was to engage them in building things in the world and see still building in the world in a very broad way uh it wasn't just building with Lego bricks although that's one way it was also building sand castles on the beach or building animations on the screen with logo or with scratch or building and creating a story or a poem you know it was all about sort of taking your ideas and getting your ideas out to the world where they could be shared with others and I think that was sort of the core of things that sour was talking about he sometimes would contrast constructionism with what he termed was too common in the world with instructionism people thinking that the way to help people learn was to have better instruction and of course instruction can be a worthwhile thing but he said that's not the way that we're going to transform young people's lives is by just coming with better ways of instructing better ways of delivering information better ways of delivering instruction instead we have to change it and create create situations where children can design create Express themselves and that's really what he did through his life uh in many ways the current maker movement very much grows out of Seymour's ideas about learning through making creating building and you really should see Seymour as the patron saint of the of the maker movement um and I do think similar with scratch had a big influence there's with all the work going on in the world these days around coding a lot of it really isn't about making things you see a lot of things around coding where it's learning certain Concepts uh or solving a certain puzzle and again there's some value to that but I think you know SE word always argued that the way for people to really become engaged with something and to engage with the ideas in a deep way is to be doing it while creating a project so in scratch the project is the core unit in scratch it's because we want people to create things and share things with others that sort of comes right out of Seymour's ideas the second seamour idea that I talked that thought of was he talked about objects to think with and he would emphasize that the objects in a child's world make a big have a big influence on the way they make sense of the world uh you know the fact that we're born with two hands helps us in understanding Symmetry and pairs so the things that we have around US influence how we think about things uh one reason he think he he liked the collaboration with the Lego company was it was an object in child in children's world that could help them in understanding the world and building in the world in seamore's work with logo he really you know took that seriously and building on his own personal experiences uh in the forward to Sour's classic book Mindstorms uh he talks about his own childhood experience with gears the forward is called Gears of my childhood and he talks about the way that he GRE actually he grew up in South Africa like Tyran and uh uh and and was oftentimes in the bush with his father who was an entomologist and loved car parts and truck parts and became fascinated with gears and looking back he said there was so so much of mathematics that you learned from playing with gears but another important part there is not just learning the mathematical Concepts which he learned from Gears which he did but importantly in that forward seamour says and he italicized this he said I fell in love with the gears and I think seamour recognize it wasn't that the best objects to think with are also objects you can relate to and objects you can engage with and objects you can care about so he fell in love with the gears and that's what made the gears so special and why he was able to learn those mathematical ideas was because he fell in love with the gears and I think he tried to do similar things when he invented logo along with you know others here you know a central object in logo was the turtle and so you you know with logo you give commands to the turtle and you have the turtle you tell to go forward and it moves forward and to turn and it turns so you can relate to the turtle as an object like your own body so you draw on your own personal experience with your body and you learn programming not some abstract way of doing calculations but by you know interacting with an object an object you could care about the turtle U I think we've also tried to keep that in mind in all of our work you know when we develop scratch scratch is you know the Sprite of scratch is sort of the central object and we made scratch we might call very Sprite Centric uh in fact there not even an easy way to sort of be the conductor of saying I want all of this is what all the different objects should do in scratch you sort of go inside the object and inside all the programming scratch say what should this Sprite do what should this object do so you can imagine yourself as a Sprite and you give the commands for what you want the Sprite to do so again very much we want to turn that into objects to think with and objects to care about and objects to engage with seamer also chose the objects like the turtle in order to help highlight what he would call powerful ideas uh because it wasn't just a matter of becoming engaged with these objects but for learning deep and important ideas from your engagement with these objects in fact the subtitle to seamor book Mindstorms was children computers and powerful ideas and actually 20 years after the publication of mindss it came out in 1980 in 2000 he wrote a paper uh where he lamented the fact that people didn't pay enough attention to that third phrase he said people pay attention to children and computers more children are using computers now but it's usually missing the powerful ideas and for seamour the powerful ideas were always Central uh and when seamour talked about powerful ideas he was you know talking about you know ideas that can you know cut across different disciplines it wasn't a idea that could just help you do one thing but ideas that could help you in many different things ideas that could help you learn other things ideas that could help you learn about learning itself so he was always looking to see how can we sort of engage people with a core set of powerful ideas that can help them in all of their learning so like he would often give example of a scientific concept like feedback which used to be you studied only at the University level of places like MIT but he said new technologies could let children start playing with this idea uh and it was an idea that cuts across it's not just an idea that you should think about in an engineering curriculum at MIT but it's used in your everyday life feedback certainly it is a way of understanding how your you know thermostat works in the heating system when it gets colder it turns on the heat when it gets warmer it turns off the heat that's a type of feedback but also The Way We Walk is feedback if you start to lean one way your body adjusts the other way uh the way things inside of our body work is about feedback systems uh that when something starts to get out of whack one way the body reinforces an alternate way to bring it back in line so this idea of feedback with he saw is important and I think one reason he was so excited when we connected the logo programming language to Lego it gave more ways to use the sensors of Lego to explore that type of powerful idea so see always look at those powerful ideas and again I think in scratch we've tried to also do that like inheriting from logo a core idea was the modularity so it's not just a matter of writing a program to get something done but giving you new strategies for thinking strategies for solving problems strategies for Designing projects to be able to break down complex things into simpler parts to take small building blocks and make more complex things or the idea of debugging is a powerful idea uh actually I thought it was lovely when Tyran was talking about her experience with debugging and which she used scratch that it's okay that things go wrong and things go wrong and then you figure out and you play around with it to see how to fix it and that's part of the process so that idea of debugging was also something that I think seamour saw as a powerful idea and that we tried to highlight in scratch and to give people ways that they can you know play around experiment it's okay for things to go wrong uh We've but then to try to figure out how could I make changes in that and that debugging the pro the project is also a way of debugging your own thinking so it's a way to think about your own thinking which is something that se was always looking to support a fourth uh idea was related to sambas schools so s seamour did not invent sambus schools but he was very influenced by sambus schools in one of the later chapters in Mindstorms sour talks about going to Brazil and observing the samba schools and I think this was very this chapter was important because especially when seamour was writing Mindstorms most people thought of computers in a very individual way it was before the internet and in fact it was called the personal computer it's your personal machine you act on the machine you do things and that's the way most people thought about the computers that were entering entering lives but seem more saw the computer to be part of a broader culture and that learning was always situated within a broader culture and he points the example of the sambus schools where they're planning the different dances for the festival you know in in Rio and in other cities in Brazil and he talked about that it wasn't just you come and you take a class to learn something how to make a float or how to do a dance but is the community came together and everybody was learning with and from one another so as a way to bring people together not just with an instructor delivering information or instruction to a learner but a whole Community coming together learning with and from one another and seamour had the vision that that's what the how computer should enter the world as well and he was ahead of his time because the technology wasn't quite there yet the tech the internet certainly has helped support that over time and had a deep influences on us as we worked on scratch the scratch online community we see it as a type of somus school of bringing together kids from around the world and adults too who will share not just projects but share ideas with each other mentoring each other doing tutorials the way that Tyran was talking about so this idea of learning with and from one another is a key part of what seamour was talking about seamour loved the phrase hard fun he said he he he took it from what he heard from kids when kids were using logo he said they would often say well it's hard but it's fun um and that resonated with seamour because seamour said too often people think that kids want things easy and he said that's wrong kids are willing to do things that are hard as long as it's things they care about and he said it's you know when kids lose interest in school it's not because it's too hard it's because they find it boring he said what you need to do is to have things that you know that they are deeply engaged with and they're willing to tackle difficult challenges and I think he would be skeptical right now there is more of an interest in the education world of bringing some sort of fun into the learning process but sometimes it's by just sprinkling sugar on top that if you do something you can get a reward and that's not at all what Seymour meant by hard fund he meant something where the fund came from the deep engagement with the thing you were creating with the ideas you're exploring the ideas that you were grappling with and playing playing with and again this side that we always try to do both in scratch and the way we introduce scratch is to connect to both interests and ideas to make sure that we connect to Young people's interests to connect to where they are with their interest and what they're interested in doing but also connect with the powerful ideas so to always make sure and we see that kids are willing to to work hard persist in the face of challenges and difficulties if they're working on things they care about and ideas that they care about the final phrase epistemological pluralism it's a mouthful I couldn't even fit it on one line on the slide so and this is a phrase that Seymour developed uh with his colleague Sher turkle another professor here at MIT and a longtime collaborator with Seymour and it very much connects with the theme of this conference many paths many styles what they meant by epistemological pluralism is multiple ways of knowing multiple ways of understanding the world multiple ways of understanding yourself and I think Seymour was always concerned that there was too much of uniformity in the world that too often schools privileged certain ways of knowing and for people who are very good at that way of knowing they succeeded at school and were happy at school but it left aside so many others and SE was always saying it doesn't have to be that way there's not just that one way of knowing U as an example you often talk about two forms of Engagement in the paper he wrote with Sher called epistemological pluralism they talk about planning and tinkering where planning is an approach where you come up with a problem you sort of analyze the problem you come up with the solution you try it out and you assess it with tinkering you see something you're not quite sure how it's going to work you try something out doesn't quite work you try to debug it you try something else and you keep on iterating to try to come with something better and SE where says too much of school and Society privileges planning and planning is useful this is not a put down of planning it's useful to do planning but he said in some situ situations and for some people tinkering is a much better approach so this idea of valuing many paths and many styles was an important part and again in developing scratch that was important for us we didn't want scratch to be something just for kids who already would have gotten involved in coding and programming we want to reach out to everybody from all different interests all different styles all different backgrounds to have many different Pathways so we try to set up the way scratches and the type of materials we develop around it to have multiple Pathways into scratch to make sure that everybody especially those who normally wouldn't have been engaged in these types of activities in the past that everyone feels comfortable engaging and excited about engaging in these ideas these ideas sort of again I mentioned Mindstorm which is a classic book I mean if there's one thing to remember from this if you haven't read Mindstorms I really encourage you to go out and read Mindstorms It Was Written In 1980 36 years ago you have to recognize some things feel a lot out of dat writing about computers in 1980 it's hard to predict exactly what the world is going to be like in 2016 but for me what's more striking is how much is still so much re so relevant to today and how much of what seamour writes about with learning in children is so true to to the issues of today so although so sadly Seymour is no longer with us I think you know the challenge for all of us is to make sure that Seymour Spirit stays alive and that what we do at this conference and Beyond is one of the ways that we can contribute to make sure that se's ideas and see with Spirit stay alive and healthy and grow and spread around the world thank you with that I'm going to pass on to saskia Leed who many of you met as the organizer who's been organizing the conference and she'll talk about some of the schedule for today and some other things to know about the conference hi everyone I thought you were great no I thought okay there's so many of you um I'm saskia I'm one of the conference organizers um and I'm going to be walking you through some logistics for today uh so everybody should have a program and your schedules on the program um this is just a a quick overview of what's happening today um two things to note are that morning workshops start very soon the first one's at 11 and the second Workshop today is at two workshops are an hour and a half today um workshops for today required prior sign up so if you have an assignment you should have a ticket in your uh name badge it's either blue or um yellow yellow depending on the time and if you don't have a signup that's totally okay you can stay in this room for the scratch educator meetups Network session uh in the morning and this room is also going to host the World Peace song project in the afternoon um there's also space this morning in the community block session as well as the code create art alive session which are both on the third floor um there are also maps in your program the media lab is kind of Labyrinth like at some points so I encourage you to open up your program and and check out the map that are in there to help you get around there's a bunch of signage um but if you have a question about where to go or if you get lost you can always find somebody with an orange lanyard which I will be wearing after this okay uh poster sessions start at 4M today they're in two locations this year on the third floor uh which is where the reception was last night and the first floor Atrium which is where you checked in so I encourage you to check out both floors there's going to be a lot of fun uh fun stuff happening at the post Rec sessions okay um at 7 o'clock there are selforganized dinner excursions tonight so we're meeting at 645 p.m um in the first FL Lobby to go off into Kendall Square for your dinner Excursion if you have not signed up for a dinner Excursion you can use this URL um I'll leave it up for a second so dinner excursions are basically groups of people going off into Kendall Square having dinner together um and getting to know each other in an informal and fun way um so I encourage you to sign up for a dinner Excursion if you haven't already and you do not need to go on a dinner Excursion if you'd like to do your own thing and also if you want to add your own dinner Excursion you can just uh tack it onto the bottom of the sheet uh a few other quick things just going to put my phone in my pocket okay that's better a few other quick things um we have unconference rooms available throughout Friday and Saturday an unconference is basically a uh mini conference that doesn't have an agenda so if there's something that you want to talk about or discuss or if you have a topic in mind feel free to write it on a PostIt note and stick it up on the unconference wall which is directly outside of this room um something to note is that there's a unconference scheduled for Scratch conference 2017 so if you're interested in learning more or even hosting scratch conference 2017 um find that one on the wall uh we also have cards in that area um I haven't officially named these but they're I want to learn I can help with card cards uh and a few people have been filling these out which is awesome so if there's something that you can help with I encourage you to fill out one of the cards if there's something you want to learn I also encourage you to fill out a card and then you can find people who can perhaps teach or learn one of your skills and connect with them on Twitter or through email um there are also day planners available outside so I encourage you to to plan your day to reflect on stuff that you want to learn today um so grab one of these on the tables as well almost done and we have free entry at the MIT Museum and Museum of Science using your name badge so if this is interesting to you take your name badge over to one of these museums and go check it out um I finally not finally almost finally encourage you to use the hashtag Scratch MIT 2016 for all social media especially pictures um which we're really excited to see your pictures uh this is my favorite thing we have a a Snapchat filter so if you're connected to the WiFi here um either MIT or MIT guest this filter will will pop po up and uh I very highly encourage you to use a filter and take some selfies um there's also a photo booth outside too so you can use the filter in the photo booth um a few points for help if you need anything throughout the conference you can tweet at us so the hashtag is ask hash ask Scratch MIT um so tweet away and we'll send you response um also you can check out the TVs around the lab those have the schedules on them through the day and you can talk to us at the help desk which is the purple desk right outside the room um and anybody who's wearing an orange lanyard is a scratch team member or volunteer so if you see somebody with an orange lanyard and have a question you can ask them uh just a quick note um there's no photography permitted in the other labs but public spaces all the sixth floor and the rooms that you'll be in you can take as many photos as you want um people who are wearing green lanyards asked to not have their photos posted on the internet so that's just something to be mindful of as you're posting on the internet and the last thing if you flip your tag over as I'm sure many of you guys have discovered already um there's a Sprite on the back of your name tag and uh there are 12 of them so I encourage you if you see somebody else who has your Sprite go say hi introduce yourself um we'll be doing more fun things with the Sprites later on in the day and um have an awesome day today we're so excited to have you here and one final thing we do just want to thank you know this conference has made possible we've had lots of generous people and organizations who helped support their conference I just want to give a shout out to the scratch Foundation to Intel to Google The Seagull family endowment uh to MIT office of digital learning the Lego Foundation they've all been major contributors no starch press which just given books for the conference so we really appreciate all the support that we've gotten from others that have made this to help support the conference so thanks and have a great day look forward to seeing you through the day
