still happy to have you here we have a very special edition the sketch for you update we're talking scratch 3.0 beta which what is that what is this people that's a great nation so many of you may have heard that we're launching a new version of scratch called scratch 3.0 that's coming out in January but right now we've launched the scratch 3.0 beta editor you can go to beta dot scratch.mit.edu try out the editor one thing to note is in January when we launched it'll be connected to the community you will have all of the projects you've created all the friends you've made will all be there but for now it's just the editor but we love for you to go there try it out start McPeak is a new editor cool so we're gonna talk about some of the things that were loving about the scratch 3.0 beta there's a lots of love so I'm going to start talking about the new sprites we have we have a huge new library new characters new creatures new objects bats you name it centaur it's there and then the new sprites have a lot of costumes so when you think about animating you got a lot of costumes to choose from sounds a lot of new sounds to huge library game sounds creature sounds you name it it's there the cat sound is still there yeah the classic meow is still there not to worry Jim 99 is also still in these sprite library mastics anyways that's my love it what about you thought yeah so I am loving the sound editor and the paint editor we've made a bunch of improvements to the tools and the vector and bitmap paint editor and then in the sound editor you can now add all sorts of cool filters like a robot back let's go effect super fun go in there try it out one thing to note about both of those is we're continuing to make improvements to the sound editor the paint editor over the next few months we've been getting tons of feedback keep that coming we're gonna you're gonna see lots of improvements try to sweet that's a lot to live lots of love what about things attract things the things to try and scratch 3.0 again there's a lot let's try Ivan I'm gonna start with the tutorials so I've been working on the tutorials you'll be able to access these tutorials by clicking the tutorials button and you'll see a library there's a lot of fun activities to try there's some how to sort of conceptual like how to change size how to spin how to hide and show but there's also activities how to animate a name how to make a chase game check them out the real fun suite so another thing to try are the extensions so if you go to the bottom lefthand corner of the editor you'll see a little button that you'll access this entire library of new sets of blocks this block now let you create all sorts of different things so some of them connect to Hardware extensions like the micro bit some of them connect to software extensions like google translate it's super exciting yeah and then you'll also find some things that have been moved into the extension like if you're looking for those ten blocks there in the extensions yeah if you're looking for video sensing extensions and over the next few months we'll continue to add extensions to the library and then when we launch that library will continue to grow so it'll be a place to super exciting yeah keep an eye out love the extensions library yes hey I have one more thing to try another thing to try is to save
