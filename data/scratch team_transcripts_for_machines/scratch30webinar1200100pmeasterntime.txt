okay I think we're on the air hello everybody welcome to the second installment of the scratch 3.0 webinars yay and certainly we have joined in this session we're joined by a few new scratch or different scratch team members in the morning session so maybe we'll start by doing a quick round of introductions and first welcome to everyone who's joining us my name is Champ Iike Fernando I lead outreach and communications for the scratch team and I'm here with I'm Amy Scott metal and I'm a graduate student in the lifelong kindergarten when scratch has board hi everyone my name is me um I help out with communications for scratch so if you follow us on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram chances are we've interacted also hi to people who are joining us from around the world I see in the chat we have Peru Switzerland and really close to us Brookline so hey everyone um and hey my name is Eric Schilling but on the scratch team for about five years first three years I was the manager of the scratch online community but in the past two years I've been working on scratch learning resources and maybe the title I'm most proud of is cohost of the scratch video update was Campeche but anyways super glad to be here with you all sweet so I think the reason we wanted to do these webinars is as many of you may know we're about to launch a new version of scratch which we're calling scratch 3.0 it's planned to launch January 2nd so you know just a few months away and we wanted to host this webinar as a way to just sort of do sort of walkthrough of that we've we've had the beta version of the editor live for a few months now hopefully folks have had a chance to try it but we wanted to do like a live walkthrough of it but also have you know some opportunity for folks to ask us questions so I think for today what we're gonna add the the way the agenda will work is and actually all of this will be recorded and we'll put up a version later that you can access so if you miss this or you want to go back and see things you'll be able to access it but what we want to do is sort of I'll start by talking a little bit about scratch 3.0 what you know why we created another version of it or why we're doing this new version of scratch then carmella and I will do a click creating a project in the new editor we'll talk a little bit about the extensions library Eric will talk about the new resources we'll talk a little bit about our code which is around the corner and then we'll try and save a lot of time for questions so let's start yeah I can't wait to make this but but before we dive into the editor actually I'll share um an important link let me try and present here you can all start asking questions we're going to be taking questions from Twitter on the YouTube chat but then also through poll everywhere so let me share that so this is the hashtag we're using on Twitter it's a hashtag scratch 3 webinar you can post your questions there and then we also have a poll everywhere link it's full of dotcom flash scratch team and so we'll be watching that and gathering questions and and if there are things that we don't get to in this hour we'll try and address them afterwards through on our ethic he or Twitter as well okay so um let me Harry said before before we jump into making a project you know we've been working on scratch 2.0 for the last couple of years and you know the last time we did a total sort of redesign or new version of scratch was a little over five year ago now would scratch 2.0 and so this new version is a complete rewrite and it moves scratch out of Flash which is great but it's it's really designed to sort of work across a broader range of devices and and specifically work well on touch devices as well and as we've been designing it we've sort of focused on two specific areas we wanted to really expand the types of things you can create with scratch and so that gets into the extension library which we'll talk about a little later and we want to provide easier ways to get started or more support for getting started with scratch which gets into the resources that Eric will talk about and one thing to note with this launch is a lot of the changes in the updates are focused on the editor we haven't made a lot of changes to the community and so on January 2nd you'll see this new editor but you know and it'll be connected to the community you'll be able to share into the community all your projects from that you've ever created them scratch should continue to work in this new editor without you know doing it work but you won't see big changes in the community yet that's planned for after the launch and later and another thing to note is I know we've gotten questions about educator accounts and we have lots of ideas for improving that experience and lots of things that we want to do there but that also won't be timed with the January 2nd launch that will come later next year when we sort of like free up some time to work on those things and one last thing that is a common question is about the offline editors we will have offline versions of scratch 3 ready on January 2nd working on Mac and Windows and later next year we'll have versions at work on Chromebook and Android and iOS ok so now that we got all the sort of like details out of the way let's actually take a look the editor and try making a project so when you load the beta editor the URL is beta that scratched mit.edu you'll get this window and you can jump in and click try it or you can also there's a button here that says view 2.0 project and if you click on that you can actually load one of your 2.0 projects and see how it works so I definitely recommend trying that and seeing how your 2.0 projects look in here but for now Camila and I are gonna go in to try it I know someone I like carmella kick us off with creating this project sure I'm always excited to make a new project and you know like this is gonna be even more exciting because it's a new project in a new interface and as you might see you know like there are like a couple of different things that we're gonna explore as we make something one thing that I usually start doing when I start a new project like that doesn't involve the scratch cat is deleting the cat so I feel bad every time but I also wanted to show you like how to delete the project like the sprite and it's a new way right you can click on this video X and now you have like a blank slate so let me add the new sprite so the way which we added you spry like we have like multiple ways to do it to choose a sprite so I can choose one from the library and or you can paint it as usual there's a new thing which is a surprise I will get that random prior that I can play with or I can upload my own right for now I'm gonna choose a sprite from the library this gives us the possibility to show how the library has changed right so there are like you might recognize some kind of like scratch classic very classic sprites you know the Apple bobeautiful but also there are new sprites here I think the bear is a new thing right and we have like KC I really love the new dinosaurs so I think I'm gonna choose one of them and actually you can also another cool thing about the new sprite library is when you mouse over them you see all the costumes associated with that sprite right away which is I love this yes yes so let me pick like this dinosaur too and now I have it here on on stage and that actually I was inspired by saying like how many costume different costumes it had so let me just like go and grab just a block as you can see that can again just like jump into different categories but what one thing is I love is I can just like scroll so I don't need to remember what is that you know which category was the switch costume here we go it's right here in looks so that scrolling works really nice on tablets to you which is another thing that sort of thought about and that in this design is like the blocks are a little bit bigger to work on touch devices but also the scrolling is much easier when you're browsing on a tablet yeah that's great so I can just like as usual I can just like click on it and I can see the effect all of this code let me just like grab control oh no it was an events what I was looking for is like when the sprite is clicked so now every time I click on the dancer kind of changes what do you want to add you're like there needs to be some sound here I want the dynastar to say something so I'm gonna go into the sounds tab here and add a sound for the dinosaur and again similar to adding a sprite you have this little menu here where you can choose a sound from the library record a sound you can get a surprised sound or you can upload your own sound I'm gonna go ahead and record a sound and so we've made a lot of improvements to the sound tab sound editor to make it both easier to record and edit your own sound but also adds all sorts of interesting filters and effects so I think if you'll help me Carmello we can maybe make our our sound for the Dinah stop so loosely on the count of three okay one two three so I'm gonna easily just trim it here by dragging these out save it I think that sounds pretty good but it might sound even better with like an echo effect like that so we'll keep that and then maybe I'll just change the name of it to be rawr I'll go back into the code tab and then if I go into the sounds category and drag out the play sound and change it to rawr see I'll just add that to your existing okay that works I feel like we need to be a little more here than yeah I was wondering where is this dinosaur leave right it's like yeah and from the boy from the egg Oh like I was thinking everything is I don't know in space or is it like somewhere else let me just like choose a backdrop and as usual I can choose a backdrop from the library I can paint a new one get a surprise or you know upload one of the backdrop so let me just like go ahead and see what is in the library and again you might recognize some of the classic kind of backdrops of scratch and some new ones let me go and share or some classic but have been like redrawn like like and one of that one of those is the underwater I think then the waters looked different it's just too and yes yeah that's actually let me see if I can code let me see he still works that's awesome okay so we have a dinosaur roaring underwater so I think maybe one other thing that I'll add to it is something from the extensions library so as I mentioned we designed this new extensions library which you can get to by clicking on this little icon in the bottom left here and the idea here was to you have sets of knee blocks that really expand the types of things you can create with scratch and give us an opportunity to sort of continue to grow this library over time and continue to expand and grow all the types of things you can make with scratch and you'll notice I'll quickly point out that there's some things that used to be sort of in the editor that are in the sort of default set of blocks that we've moved into extension so for example if you're looking for the pen blocks they're now an extension some of the music blocks have been moved into this music extension that also includes some new music blocks and then video sensing has also been moved into the extensions library but more exciting we've added all these new extensions if some of them are software extensions like texttospeech and translate but then we've also added some Hardware extensions which connect devices like micro bit a Lego Mindstorms ev3 and the Lego form will be available all those will all be available on January 2nd at launch and then we hope to you know continue to release more of those over time so I think I'll actually one thing I'll point out is you know we get a lot of questions about sort of other people are also creating their own extensions and that's something we would love to support and we plan on putting out documentation and support for that later next year okay so I think enough sort of description of extensions I will add maybe Texas yeah let's try that wise see what we can do with that so when I click on it it adds this new category of texttospeech and I've got the new 3d blocks block maybe y'all see the dinosaur say hello Carmelo hello hello okay that's interesting I was like it's not exactly the voice I was expecting from the dinosaur but you never know in script yeah you can have all sorts of but I but maybe we should change the voice so we have another block here so actually I noticed okay cool I actually went when you show the extensions I was curious about another extension oh is that the translate X yes you can add multiple exceptions the same project that's great so I'm going to like check this one and translate text into many languages so now I have both the Texas beach in the Translate here and I was actually very curious to see you know like when the sprite is clicked now the voice is kidding so I guess it would it would say like and yeah Meow's later and we can try but so instead of that I'm gonna translate hello well say hello in Russian pika I wonder if it'll translate share be good into I hope I spelled it right in Italian like this how would she say ciao let's see if it works on us click I'm sprite blur oh wait you said by me I'll because there's a kiddin okay let's see okay that's that sort of you know you'll see that creating in scratch 2.0 is very familiar and similar to if you've been creating in scratch to which you know was the goal we don't want it to be a totally confusing new experience but for the most part we've done a lot to just like make it feel a lot nicer work better on touch screens and then you know we have these new sounds new characters new backdrops and then this brand new extensions library so I think another new thing that I mentioned we've focused on was you know more ways to support people getting started and so I'll hand it over I think to air it about that gonna stop presenting cool can you see us yeah okay cool well try to match the energy that you two have but it shouldn't be hard so actually before we start I wanted to actually share just one or two time to label things that I'm living in this fast viewpoint 3.0 editor so I'm gonna attempt to screen share maybe champ and Carmelo you could let us know if you have to see the screen yeah okay cool I just like a couple like small things that really make me happy in 3.0 the color picker is like so great now so it's gonna drag out we win touching colors a block that we use and a lot of you know games and now so when you want to pick a color you can use the color picker and it's so beautiful like it zooms in and gives you a sense of the color by sort of filling up that ring with the color so this is super delightful super useful also thinking of you know when you first introduced scratch and people start to put together their first couple of blocks tax and then they accidentally throw in a block that they don't want and it's in the middle of their stack it's sometimes difficult to say okay we'll remove it and then put that back on so actually in 3.0 now you can you can control click and then delete that block in the stack which is really really great especially for newcomers and then I wanted to highlight this block that I also think is great for for newcomers which is you can glide to a sprite now so you can use glide to random position or glide to in this case unicorn 2 so I will collide so that's really good for like you know animating characters like interactive pet like glide to the food bowl live to the water or you can do an infinite loop where everyone tries to glide to each other so anyways it's just like the small things like that in addition to everything that Carmelo and champ shared so with that I wanted to talk about the resources that we've been developing for scratch 3.0 we you can access a lot of these resources in the scratch 3.0 editor if there is a button right here called tutorials that takes you to I guess what we're calling the tutorials library and let's just kind of cruise through some of these so first things first is we have a great getting started activity this is I'll click it for you it's a 60 second video that introduces you can orient you to the scratch and editor and which scratches and then you can then click this right this arrow here and then see some of the block stacks that are featured in the video and this kind of paradigm of video followed by animated gifts with the cards is kind of seen throughout all of our activities here in scratch 3.0 I should note that we've been sort of developing these and iterating them we've been doing play tests around Boston and we learned so much after each play test so you can expect that these will continue to evolve in small ways but we think it's really important to be testing these and so I I would say it's each research that we have here has been a place that said at least five or six times locally so let's go back into tutorials page you can see a number of resources I've some number of activities up here at the top these are two hour of code activities which I'm going to wave my hands at now and we'll get back to a bit later when we talk about hoc but you can see some of the familiar ones like animated named make music make a clicker game the hitch J's game continued add more but I wanted to quickly maybe spend 30 seconds to show you the make music tutorial so let's go ahead and click that we see it's gonna be a modal that pops up that contains all of sort of the learning resources content here and and here's maybe I don't wanna bury the lead you notice this isn't a YouTube video so I'm happy to report that we've sort of moved off on YouTube so I can hear the screams of educators of enjoy actually this is gonna be so we're hosting the videos which is something that educators have been asking us to do for a long time so that's that's the player that we're using is sort of an internal scratch player so uh it should work at this video then so let's watch sort of this thirty second video about make music you can use scratch to make music create a song make a beat or anything else you can imagine to get started take a spray I'll pick the saxophone now let's make it interactive I'll make the saxophone play a sound when I click it click the green arrow to see this code again and explore what else you might add to your project well so that 30second video is just supposed to be a teaser it's supposed to generate inspiration on what you might make and just give you just a quick sense of at least one of the stacks that you might create and then you click the right arrow that learners would click the right arrow and then you can see that code again plus more ideas on one of those what else you might add to your project they're supposed to generative and then at the end of the tutorial you get links to the tutorials page or you get to see two different tutorials so in this case add back drop and add a sprite which are again twist regenerative so you've made your musical instrument what next maybe adding a background maybe adding a new character maybe adding a sound and so we sort of once you've gone through the deck of cards as we call them we want to make sure that there's many possibilities after that to make the project really your own and then quickly I want to go over some of the some of what we call the howto videos which are sort of topic focused so if we if we scroll down the page past the activities you can see so add a background glide around record a sound use arrow key switch costumes these about 30 seconds long they sort of they show you the concept in a very tinkerer Bowl kind of way so this is again wonderful if you're in the classroom and you hear the classic well I'm done with my project well I have you thought about you know moving with arrow keys or recording a sound so you can be guiding learners here we'll continue to add to this library and something that's really important to us is making sure that these videos are all localized so it's a priority that we've been that's one of our priorities so just to give you a quick sense of what that looks like we started to sort of translate in Japanese so this is the animator name of video in Japanese it's gonna jump it no Maya will go video don't mine you know Joe come on once you know it okay buddy and you can see the editor is also translated so you don't have to go to youtube to get these this is again coming uh we're working as fast as we can but it will these videos will live in 3.0 and when you switch languages you will have audio that is localized and you will have the scratch editor localized as well so I think is really important for us so I have run down my list of things that I wanted to mention as far as resources are concerned please do send any questions that you have about these resources to the I'm not sure the URL there me pull Eve yeah slash scratch team but it looks like I'm supposed to talk about hoc as well exact is that right champ yep okay so our of codes super excited right around the corner me do you know the dates for our code I believe it is December 9th December 9 13 December 9 to 13 sorry maybe that's not I didn't mean to put you on the spot there anyways we have two new activities for hour of code and you can access those activities either you know in the tutorials on the toriel's page so that's gonna be create animations that talk or animated adventure alternatively if you're a fan of going to the hour of code website hour of code comm slash us activities and you'll see us here animated adventure game this is a collaboration with Cartoon Network we're using some of the Cartoon Network sprites and you make it pretty simple but fun game where you've got run around and collect objects and then we'll scroll down you'll see our second tutorial which is create animations that talk this is also maybe even better for newcomers than the Cartoon Network activity this is using the texttospeech activity and it's I think a phenomenally well developed exercise for folks that are that are new to scratch kind of reminds me of like an animated character so you're giving a person sort of personality and movement to the character so I check both of those out and if you really love the scratch 2.0 hour of code activities those are still going to be available so no worries no worries there in fact if you want to go to those activities during hour of code if you log in on your scratch account right there there's gonna be a massive banner a huge banner that links directly to the scratch 2.0 resources and so that's important there's an important distinction there again all I went to because they scratch 3.0 activities for our code the ones that I just showed here you will have to download you want to save your project you download those on your computer if you really want to use to scratch 2.0 resources the hour of code resources you'll just log into your accounts and you'll see them on the home page banner so it's an important distinction to make and I just wanted to make a correction to the dates I provided coed week is actually December third through ninth so I think I got some of the numbers right there but just repaired yeah confirming CS ed week is December 30 39 every day is yes so don't feel like can you tell just one hour but yeah I have many hours of code but again yeah I would love to answer any resources questions that folks have so please fill up that poll with questions I think I talk forever I don't launch so I'm sorry add one more thing to resources and our our tips page I just want to make a quick plug to check out scratch that MIT that edu slash tips you go there today you know you'll find a set of activities and links to our activity cards which people let me see we have free sort of PDF versions of our activity cards there but we're but we also have the hard copies that are available for purchase and we'll have updated versions of these ready for the scratch 3.0 watch on January 2nd as well and then one other thing you know we know that one thing that makes scratch so great is the sort of community around it both you know kids educators but also resource developers for making all sorts of resources on top of the things that we're making and we've been working with a few resource developers to help ensure that right when we launched there will be a good range or variety of resources available in addition to the ones that Eric just showed so the scratch ed team at Harvard is working on updating their creative computing guide and that should be available around the launch as well the CS first team at Google is working on updating all of their video content and resources and they plan to launch those January 2nd and then the Raspberry Pi foundation is working on updating all their activities their scratch activities that are part of code club and I'll just quickly share the links to all of those very good so these are the links to those resources that I mentioned and then again our resources in addition to the videos that use video tutorials inside the editor you can go and find more resources at our tips page and we'll be updating that for the launch and I think we wanted to show really quickly because we mentioned that key point about you know for our code if you're using the beta tutorials that you should be saving so maybe I'll have carmella yeah yeah this is something that I usually do when I create a project with scratch 3.0 as I can't like save it on on the community yet yes yep I can download it on my computer so going in two to five and load to your I'm gonna have here up to scratch project that it's safe so now if I certainly below the pager I go back to scratch people you know and I want to open to try it and this time I'm gonna do upload from your computer can be a salad [Laughter] our dinosaurs came yeah okay great so I think that covers oh and then I guess like one more before we jump into Q&A you know just reiterating the launch timeline so the beta is available today for you to go and try at beta scratch.mit.edu again it's not connected to the community so you can create projects save them locally and then I'm January 2nd is when we will flip the switch and when you go to scratch.mit.edu the editor there will be the 3.0 editor and I can't remember if we mentioned this earlier but for those of you who want to continue using the 2.0 editor we will still have the offline version of the 2.0 editor available for download and we'll continue to support that and you'll be able to get to that by going to scratch that MIT that edu slash downloads and you can get previous versions of the editor they're great so I have a very long list of questions for the team here so thank you everyone for submitting them we've gotten messages from Portugal Turkey Malta France Brazil Brooklyn so people are joining us from all over so just a reminder if you want to ask a question you can tweet us using the hashtag scratch 3 webinar or you can use the pull that we've dropped in the YouTube chat it's pull Evie comm slash scratch team so this first question I'm gonna group them together just to reiterate for folks who have me may have joined later will there be an offline version available on January 2nd will it work on Chrome books will work on tablets and phones I think I can't be a you can probably take this one yes that's a great question and it has somewhat complicated answer so there's there will be offline versions available on January 2nd there will be a Windows and a Mac version of the offline editor available to download we will later next year release an offline version that works on Chromebooks which we've never had before so excited about that we had a lot of requests for that and then native versions of Android and iOS will also release later next year but in the meantime I just want to point out the way that scratch 3.0 is designed it's all html5 so it'll work in any modern browser which means you can open it up on your Android or iOS device through true a browser and you know we've been testing it on those devices and so they should work pretty well it's obviously not going to be as great a native experience but it's designed to work really well on those devices as well and and I will point out one thing we haven't mentioned is you'll also be able to play your projects on a phone and well you know that experience will have to continue to improve after launch but one of the things we're working on is a redesign of the project cage just to make it easier to crash on your phone great so folks are curious about what's what changes may be planned for the rest of the website and what the community will look like in scratch 3 point now you want to take that one there resident yeah maybe toss to toss excuse me to my question one more time sure so what changes are planned for the rest of the website and what the community will look like the QA what's the same I don't think the community is change much so that's I hope the changes for the rest of the website uh you know January 2nd you won't see too many changes to the scratch website and I think changes incrementally will we're allowed to crops the project page maybe the splash page I mean you'll see updated resources certainly so those will be changes but unless I am mistaken I don't think there's gonna be any like noticeable changes to the sort of the website side of things on January 2nd and I get incrementally wrong enough is that is that accurate so I got serious I just but you talk to you this that's totally accurate and I think yeah just to reiterate like the the major the January 2nd launch is mostly focused on updates and changes to the editor do you plan to make your improvements and updates to the community over time but what you'll see on January 2nd at most is like you know the project page will be will have like a bit of a visual update to match the look and feel with the editor no big like the feature changes there and then the home page you'll see some banners and things talking about scratch things I know but again you know no big feature changes there and then one thing I'll just preemptively say again as I think we mentioned this maybe earlier but educator accounts there's you know lots of questions that we get around improving that experience and updating that and I think you know we've been having a lot of conversations here about things we can do to improve that experience including tapping into like popular platforms and then we then we definitely want to make those improvements but that will come after the launch January 2nd so it's different okay so these next three questions I'm gonna throw rapidfire so I think maybe yes or no will suffice since we have a bunch of questions are you removing any existing blocks its registry point oh we definitely made some slight changes to existing blocks I can't think of locks that were removing but I could be wrong here yeah according to the FAQ no blocks have been repeated there are there are some assets in the library that will not will not only be there that said we tried to make sure that that wouldn't impact any previous resources that were produced so if you're using the 2.0 resources I'm 99% sure that you won't have to worry about those assets not being in it so I did one thing we kind of trimmed on the library to add some new stuff great it's like this is like also related to old projects like keeping working on on the new version of stretch so like so surprising to not find a block that would be I use them so when you're gonna scratch to burn your project you will have to keep working on it yeah great um will there be a backpack in scratch 3.0 yes okay so will that be done by January 2nd I'm not sure will there be an option to switch the stage left and right no okay right at all that sure okay so so the previous version of scratch scratched 2.0 or the current version of scratchers had the stage on the left side if you're familiar with the version before that the stage was actually on the right side so the decision to move it to the left side came from when we designed scratch 2.0 it was the first time we were moving the editor to connect to the community and have it beat in the browser and we had that whole see inside button or you can switch the project page to the editor and we wanted to make that feel seamless and so we tried to keep the stage in the same place on the project page and the editor so that was sort of what was driving the shift to the left side and then in the design of 3.0 I think the play testing and try and think that scratcher is what we found was it's actually a better user experience and a better flow to have it go from you know like dragging blocks to the left and then playing on the right just for natural flow so we went back to the original some might say cool great we have a specific question about the demo that Carmelo and sham pika did they they loved the rollover costume preview is that something that will work on tablets that is a good question I think so there's a lot of things like that that they're sort of like figuring out that are sort of like design an engineering team are sort of trying to figure out like the goal is to make the experience on tablets be as much to say that we got a question in the previous webinar about like will it be a different experience on tablets only the only place where it all differs if we've had to do something because of the sort of form factor of the device or the constraints of the device but so I imagine you know obviously you can't do this or rollover but I think having some way of previewing the costumes associated with the right is something we'll try to do great so many questions I know a question that we have been getting a lot but I'm also curious to know will there be any online collaboration features in 3.0 or how are we encouraging collaboration in scratch 3.0 I don't think there's any explicit new collaboration features that we're adding to the editor I think it's been a question that's been asked quite a bit over the years and still thinking through what that looks like I don't do anything else dad maybe one thing that would mention like one thing that I'm very excited is that the code of scratch it's open source that means that like everybody can somehow remix the entire interface of strands and they can like you know like add features or work on things hmm yeah I care about and who knows maybe some of this features would be at some point incorporated in in the official scratch so when I hear about like features like this one that would be super exciting you know for people to try I will try I would encourage developers like to jump in to try it out and some of this seems kind of like simple from the conceptual point of view but implementing and making it like easy for children of all ages and easy to understand he's a challenge like working very every single pixel yeah and we want to say I think the resources team is thinking about ways in which we can develop resources to show how kids are collaborating now in the scratch community or in like multi animator projects and things like that and so highlighting more ways in which using the current tools that you have to collaborate cuz we see like beautiful collaborations happening the scratch community there's left to learn for sure yeah okay so for these last 15 minutes I'm gonna shift to resources and then maybe we can end on extensions let's see so questions about the scratchcards one will scratchcard still be available per scratch 3.0 and a followup question will they be translated yeah so they we are working on updating all of the scratch cards for three Fredo Eric do you know I I know that there is a goal I'm sure of eventually having them translated I don't know it's that timeline matches be ready right we're not playing the time I literally will be available translated great and maybe we can answer this question again for folks what is happening to the tips window inspections yeah this window is kind of being converted into a gel just screen chat really quick the tips page which I think we all love and I know is me what does they claim this way so the tutorials and those activities now live in the tutorials library again which you can access from a map I read going to tutorials and then the tips bar is now more like a tips modal in the sense that it kind of lives on top of the editor and you can access all that content here I'm happy with this sort of arrangement I think it's nice to sort of be moving it around yeah one thing you tutorial like this new library and the moat like it's much more visual and I think there's like a consistent feel with all the tutorials or a question related to that is whether we're planning to build out more scratch toriel of course yeah yeah yeah definitely and I think there's been a lot of interest and I just a loaded term but like more advanced quoteunquote advanced tutorials than like I think we have a great sort of breadth of sort of introductory very generative activities and with addition to those small concept howto videos but we've certainly been thinking about some of the ways in which like platform games and that in gravity and telling some of these concepts that folks it was a more comfortable familiar scratch so I would be on the lookout in the new year or in expanding tutorials library and maybe even leaning heavily towards sort of these more advanced yeah topics so these two questions are related what will happen to scratch 1.4 and 2.0 when scratch 3.0 launches and will I need to update existing resources or curriculum yeah so though the offline versions are the standalone versions of 2.0 and 1.4 will continue to exist if you go to scratch will people continue to be available for download if you go to scratch that mit.edu /downloads so you'll be able to continue that we aren't actively developing those but we will continue to sort of like make sure they are available for people to use and so if you have resources that are designed specifically for those editors you should be able to use them with these standalone versions or the offline versions we do encourage you to go for research we know that it's like a big process to update resources and we've tried to design this new version so that there isn't isn't a huge pain for people updated losers but we know that it is a lot of work we do encourage people to try and do it but also understand that it's something that takes time okay for educational publishers and content creators and resource developers is there a way to access scratch 3.0 blocks for updating books and tutorials so this the question essentially of like is there a way to get like PNG yes yes that also came up in this morning's to turn on I don't think right no more here but I don't know that we have I know we've gotten questions about this from other resource of opera isms like that just a file in geez I don't think we have something like that but I know there's been we've thought about creating something I don't know if we've made any progress on doing that it's so stay tuned stay tuned yeah and could we talk about we've been trying to we haven't even no list that we sort you know to folks who are developing special resources and this seems like maybe the next email we do out to them we should mention a question just like this yes all actually just for a moment show the URL where you can sign up for that mailing list yeah we can leave that up and we can jump to another question yeah um actually why don't we go back to this question about the sound editor I'm curious if there are there is a new sound library in 3.0 yeah yeah so there's yeah I would have happy to crew see that really click and show you so we've updated we even I think improved the sound library this selection quite a bit Eric Rosenbaum who's on the team did a deep dive to try to find oh my gosh Creative Commons license loops and keys other sounds and so you can you can use sort of this new interface that we have tags to search the different sort of areas again you can mouse over to play it so I won't spend too much time with this there's a variety of really high quality new sounds from loops to sound effects so totally I check it out probably continue to add that to the coming year the person who asked that question really enjoyed that they said awesome okay great I'll give thanks for that so we have a few questions here about extensions let's see one will each recognition extension be available that was a good question Oh are we still on okay so yeah I don't know I'll toss it can peek on that one yeah sorry we were having I think there might have been some weird inception sharing going on Paula jeez so the witch extension was that that recognition yeah so that is something so there's there's a whole like you know so there's extensions that are available in the beta now which will be ready for launch and then there's I mentioned that's an area where we want to grow that library it's there some that are sort of in development and so people may have seen demo the speech recognition one in various places but that's not that will be ready for January a second and there are a lot of things that I think are still some challenges with on the development side with that one and so we don't have a clear timeline for when speech recognition will be available but you know like this kind of getting stayed staying tuned I just read some comments about like the the link wasn't like couldn't see it so let me just like straight sure and one thing snow should just pause as we screen shares I think it okay tree rapid fire some questions at the end yeah so well in offline version of scratch three be available for Raspberry Pi actually let's just pause for a second oh sorry sorry what's pause for one second and just share this URL yeah maybe you can also type it into the ly scratch resource yes and we just dropped it into the YouTube chat as well three working at the technical k99 will there be a Raspberry Pi extension available on in January not at the January 2nd launch but we have been working closely with folks at the raspberry PI's Edition on lots of different things and that's one of the things that we have been talking to them about and working on so hopefully it will be available sometime soon but we have this one that developers oh sure how can developers create extensions yeah that's a great question so we definitely want to support unofficial or experimental extensions and the plan is we will be will be releasing some documentation and support for doing that but it'll be later in 2019 and hopefully not too long after the launch but stay tuned for that because we definitely that's one of the areas that were most excited about with extensions is great just following up we've received a ton of questions about micro bit and scratch 3.0 and whether it will be available yeah yeah so that would data and we're continuing to develop that and we have lots of ideas for improving it and extending and then we also received a question about whether projects that were created in 2.0 won't work in three point oh yes yes yes we've been testing like crazy to make sure that's the case and we'll scratch three will scratch online the only 3.0 starting January 2nd yeah I see a block recommendation from game masters thanks for the recommendation we don't we don't have any plans to put that in yet great so I think maybe to wrap up we can just share again what extensions will be available in January 2nd win 3.0 launches yeah so when we launch we'll have the combination of software and hardware exceptions there will be new extensions like texttospeech translate and then some hardware extensions which are micro bit Lego Mindstorms ev3 thank you Lego we do 2.0 and then as I pointed out earlier we'll have some extensions that are basically blocks that were in 2.0 that we packaged in extensions which we put out like 10 videos and then you know stay tuned because this is an area we'll continue to add exceptions every time well microbe Network for your on Chromebooks I believe at launch they will not work you'll have to wait for the offline but a standalone version ok no but that's one of the one of the things we should double check on that data I make you are good I'm sure things like tablet will be able to connect to the hardware extensions and actually maybe in these last three minutes we can let people know where to find the FAQ which answers a bunch of questions that we covered and also didn't cover in this session all right there we go so we have our FAQ at scratch that mit.edu slash three FAQ and then you can also follow us on Twitter and Facebook and then as we mentioned earlier there's no research developer you can also sign up for a resources alternate I don't actually we shared earlier those of you that are really interested in the development process and want a closer look at how we're developing scratch or if you want to remix the editor in some way you can go to github.com /lk and see sort of the code as it's being develop yeah and also like speaking of extensions you know like it's not like the extension so I wish Ray was here but I like the extension it's not support it's not official yet but you can go in the code like I did it like last month I was just like playing around with extensions so you can see how the current extensions have been developed and create your own extension if you want to play with Arduino or if you wanna do something that's not yet officially supported you can way around where we definitely seen folks already starting to events or sharing with us what they're creating and then it'll be officially will have a special support for that episode later next year yeah thank you if you liked it you can come back at 600 p.m. Eastern or gain it again and just a reminder this has been recorded so a webinar of some kind will be uploaded to our YouTube channel and we'll be recapping what happened blog posts on the scratch blog also links everyone I see you on Shawn hi
