highlight the mix and match camp that's been happening so you might have remembered from last update we talked about it it's essentially just a community initiative where everyone was given a character and a prop and a background and they created those assets and then this week the second week everyone put together their projects and so we have a link to the studio and so people used a scientist sprite a sorry festival backgrounds like a party festival background aqui as the object and the line of dialogue they had to use was sorry I thought you were somebody else so it's very cool to see what scratchers came up with projects yeah you should check out the studio so another thing that we love is a project by rainbow cookie 7 called when with the winds it was this beautiful visual poetry project of animation that they produce along with a poem that they compose it's really beautiful and should share very peaceful i love it cool so we have our next segment things to try my
