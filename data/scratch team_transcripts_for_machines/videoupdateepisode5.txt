hi everyone Welcome to our fifth scratch video update I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on Scratch and I'm Eric also known as speak visually on scratch welcome we're joining you from a very sunny and warm Boston much different than episode three um so we're glad to have you here um we're going to jump into our first segment which is love it which is projects that we found in the community that we really well love uh and so one project that I loved you know I'm a sucker for those dress up games and there was one called 18th century dress up and what I thought was cool was it used sort of these clothing clothing items from like 300 years ago and a lot of them I actually weren't Familiar of what they were and so when you click it and you sort of drag it onto your person it explains what it is and where it goes which is pretty cool so I was like trying to piece it together I'm like which goes on where and so anyways I really really enjoyed that game cool so a project that I love is a project by scratcher mini Dash macaroon and it's how to make a pancake so I really love waffles and I can have it any time of the day but Minnie macaroon wanted to highlight the counterpart of waffles pancakes and so in this project you put different ingredients into a bowl milk baking soda eggs and you whisk it together and then towards the end of the project you throw it in a pan hence the name pancake and you um wait till it kind of gets golden brown and then it's ready to eat and you can put berries in it it's really delicious it sounds very delicious I can go for one of those right now get pancakes um and as I didn't mention the dress up game was by creative Rarity yes was the person who made the dress up game um and so we have our next segment which is things to things to try Triple T um and we have um a really cool thing to try and it's related to something that I've been thinking about um which is sort of scratch around the world so I was thinking about scratch Day stuff and I'm like wow scratch really is something that happens around the world world and so we just launched a new scratch design studio called scratch around the world um and so have to think about that for a moment and so if you if you check it out it's on the homepage you can see there's already like over a 100 maybe 200 projects in there and the projects revolve around um sort of where you live so uh and your culture so maybe it's what you eat maybe you have a special way of making pancakes um what kind of music you listen to what celebrations you have and so it's like super super fascinating to see all the different representation around scratch so another thing to try it's another Studio on the homepage called uh super pie day and uh I know it might be confusing but it's not pie you don't eat this pie although pie sounds good right now it does pancakes and Pie is the theme of this video update but pie is the number 314 and5 well the reason why I remembered five is that this P day is Super P day because of 31415 and there is this featured Studio where people are already contributing different projects about the number Pi one suggestion I have is maybe making a pi maker so actually with pi but you can eat oh a p pie a p pie I like saying that pie pie anyways um cool so definitely check out that studio it's on the homepage um and so that we have a very very special although all the messages from the team are special I really especially like this one um a drum roll we have to do a drum roll sorry we have to do a drum roll and it's really sunny so let's bring that keeps coming into the camera it's a good thing it's melting the snow um and so we have a very special uh video update from Mitch and Natalie on the scratch team you may you might uh remember I think two episodes ago Mitch and the tour of his office showed us a book and that book had um the early screenshots of scratch uh and so Mitch and Natalie have been around for you know as long as scratch has been around and they're going to show us give us a peek into what scratch look like when they're first developing it all right let's take a look hi I'm Mitch also known as EMZ on Scratch and I'm Natalie also known as Natalie on Scratch and actually we've been working on scratch for a long time now I think we started in 2002 probably before a lot of you were even born uh so scratch has come a long way from where we first started u it's great we have this book that one of the scratch team members Tommy you know created so it's great to take a look at some how far scratch has come so here's what scratch looked like all the way back in 2004 it's pretty different we had the top down view of a cat I can see that the blocks didn't even have little no notches on them yet and there weren't any categories yet or you had to use a little pull down menu for categories and I think one of the things we were we would think we started thinking about is what should be the main character Bay I remember we had an illustrator come up with some possibilities for us here are some of the first sketches of what might be the main character yeah so Wing made these and we had talked about a cat although it wasn't quite what we thought but you'll see the Gobo which we had first called just the blob um before I came up with the name Gobo looks a lot like Gobo does now except for those ones with the little the longer legs but we like these ones and for a while I thought that we should make this the main character but then we talked about more and we thought it' be better to have it should be recognizable animal like a cat so we asked to illustrate our wing to come with some more we didn't really like these so much so we asked for him to come up with some other ones here some of his sketches of the scratch cat and you can see some would look like today's cat but there some other ones that one's a little crazy yeah this was already a six iteration so it took a lot of different tries to get to one that we thought would really work for the scratch kit and then we just worked on how to color it in and there was still a long way to go and Shifting the eyes uh then uh we also continue to think a lot about the interface you know here if we go through the years uh you can see here's one before we had the idea of broadcast to send messages from one to another one idea was to have colored Flags like a you would wave a different color flag to send a message or then we also tried different color envelopes which actually you can see now on scretch Jr but then it was hard to remember what those were about then I remember before broadcast you really wanted shout yeah was I thought would be nice to you once once once Sprite would shout a message to another one yeah but then I thought that was actually sounded too fun cuz it sounded like well you'd really expect your Sprite to shout and you'd expect to hear it but in fact you wouldn't hear anything so we s it on broadcast you see other things too like it wasn't moved then it was forward at first so a lot of the names changed over time uh and again it continued to evolve uh I hated when the interface looked like this I just didn't think it looked very good uh but then now it started to look a little bit more like it showed up as like it came out as and continue to evolve through still the top down cat here but we started have when green flag clicked came the flag just for that and then finally we came out and the cat made its appearance and this is right around the time we were ready to come out and show scratch to the rest of the world so welcome back I hope you enjoyed that yes scratch has changed a lot over the years I really especially love the scratch cat and the goo how that changed amazing super amazing so we'll see you again we're we're switching to a monthly update so still be awesome but we'll just see you once a month okay cool see you then bye
