hello everyone and welcome to this scratch tutorial i'm ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun today we are creating the hero fighting against the chrono wireless game this is an easy beginner tutorial if you've never written any code at all this tutorial is for you start you go to the scratch website by searching scratch mit and just click on this link from here if you click on the create it takes you to the scratch development environment let's get a quick tour of this location first this part on the top right where the cat is is called the stage that's where your game actions or generally everything you program takes place here for example if you write a code that tells the cat to move or dance that's where you see the cat is moving or dancing so in the reward here is the location that you see your output the part under the stage is where we see the sprites and backdrops in this part you can add many sprites or delete this rice and also add the backdrops sprites are like characters in your games every sprite such as this cat has three things which takes us to these three items code costumes and sound discolorful sections that look like pieces of puzzle are called code using these codes you can tell the computer what to do the one beside it which is custom using a custom you can tell your character how you want it to look like so like this is one shape this is another shape and then from sounds you can add as many sounds as you like like mew alright so let's get back to writing our code first thing we're going to do today is you're going to remove this cat by clicking on this pin and now we are going to add two new sprites one is a hero and the other one is the chrono virus for the hero i just click here and then i go to the sprite library then i can filter down to people maybe and then i just keep searching and see which one looks like that is like a hero maybe this one looking strong okay let's take this first so this is my hero my hero has several customs that's what we want so this is cool and then i need one more thing i need one other character for my chrono virus this is something that i made up so it doesn't exist in this library so we need to create it the way we can do it in scratch you see this paint i can open the paint and create and draw it by myself so i just take a circle from here i draw a circle and then i draw one more smaller circle i press ctrl c to copy it and then i press ctrl ctrl b multiple times to generate several of it and then i lay them around to make it look like a virus alternatively you can just go to google image and download some image into your computer and draw it but then i just wanted to show you how you can draw as well let's put some eyes maybe a mouth an evil one so looks good to me then i press ctrl a i select everything and then i group them together cool so now i have a corona virus and a hero i go here and duplicate this and then i reshape it so that i have two variation of it like two customs so i press ctrl a and then i squish it a bit so that when i'm writing my game i have two different versions like of the coronavirus with two customs okay cool the goal of this mini game is we want this virus to move around and then we want this hero to follow the virus in order to do that we need to write a code for it because computers do not know what to do unless we tell them what to do the same thing for this virus this virus is pretty stupid it doesn't know what to do until we tell them so let's write a code for it the first step in my code is i want to say when this flag is clicked i want something to happen so i go to the code section and then we have various groups of codes i'm talking about an event like when flag clicked so let's look at the events section i have this block so i drag it here when flag is clicked next step is i want the wires to point towards my mouse pointer this is the kind of emotion so let's go to the motion and see what we've got here we have point towards mouse pointer so i drag it here so my expectation is when i click here earth should point towards my mouse pointer with it which it did what happens right now is that this virus points toward my mouse pointer kind of turns around it but it doesn't move towards it i want it to also move towards my mouse pointer so i add one more line of code here i go to the motion category because i'm talking about movement so i drag this move 10 steps and now it moves what this 10 step says that is whenever you read this line of code come for move 10 steps so i can adjust this the speed by changing this number to make it faster or make it slower but you see we have a little problem here when the wires get so close to my mouse pointer it makes this a little crazy dance let's try to fix this as well in order to fix this we can say maybe we just don't let the virus to get close to the pointer so we say only move point towards the mouse pointer and move 10 steps only in the condition that the distance between the mouse pointer and the virus is more than a certain amount so let's go to the if conditions from the controls and drag this if then around the forever so this should go out forever do do the things only if some condition is available and then i define the condition by using the greater block operator and the distance from the sensing group so i go to the operator and then i take greater than i put it in here and then from the sensing i take this distance to mass pointer so i'm saying if the distance to mouse pointer is more than 50 unit only in this condition you are required to do this steps so see what happens so now you say it's a bit better it doesn't get too close but it can be even more to make it more stable and maybe even more now i like it better so we play with it until we get to our desired number let's program our hero which is this guy in scratch is called batter but we want to rename it to hero so from here i change the sprite name to hero what we want this hero to do is chase the wires and smash it this is quite similar to what we did for the virus so we say when the start clicked point towards the so let's go to the motions points where this time you want to point point towards the wires not the mouse pointer so i change it to a point towards the chrono virus and move for instance 10 steps and the same as last time we want it to happen forever so constantly do these things i don't want to click start every moment so here and this should go inside let's see how it works here we go now we also want to do one more thing we want the virus to be squashed and make some noise when the hero hits it so let's go back to the virus again for smashing the wires we can use customs because that's where we can control the shape of sprites the precondition for smashing the wires is being hit by the hero so let's read it like this we need an if then block from control so here we go just like right after the moves and everything and then the condition can be dragged from the sensing group here touching hero is what we need so from the sensing touching the hero i put it here so in case the virus is touching the hero we want something to happen which is getting a new custom since custom is relevant to the looks i go here and then i say next costume vote next costume and then maybe wait a bit stay in that shape for a short time maybe 0.2 seconds and then again next costume let's see how it works yeah so it's being smashed when the battery is hitting it but it's just pretty quick maybe i can make it a little bit slower so that we can see what is actually happening weight maybe 0.6 here and here yeah that's what i want super cool right looking at the way this hero is moving it looks like it's just gliding it doesn't really look like it's moving what we want is we wanted to move that stick so that it can smash the wires we also can do this by using a costume like last time so dragging the next costume from the looks here now it looks like it's actually moving that stick in order to make it a little slower i can add a weight here so that i can see the movements easier maybe not not so long like this there are more things we can do to make this more interesting let's say we want a hero to say go away and also make a kind of like a pop noise when it touches the virus so let's create a second module of code so that this one doesn't get super long alright i say when the flag is clicked forever if so i want to condition if the distance to chronovirus um in the here i drag this and then under sensing i choose what i'm measuring the distance again against it so i want to say if the distance to chrono virus is less than 20 and that's in that case i wanted to make some noise or play some sound play sound pop until done so let's see what happens it's just pretty too a bit too much when it's so close so i put a weight after it so that it plays and it also waits where it is here under control and then i added weight i also want to add a kind of a note on top of the hero to say go away so i go to the looks we have this like say i can put it here i change it to say go away for two seconds for instance let's test it way is coming a bit late that's because it should it doesn't need to wait here now it's better it's pretty cool isn't it oops let's fix this type also go away we can also add a backdrop i can add it from here i have all things so i can choose whatever i want we have hero we have virus which one seems more relevant um maybe a just blue sky oh such a cool game we made together i'm so proud of you this was a nice beginner tutorial that showed you some fundamentals of coding such as loops conditions controls troubleshooting and doing more of this stuff can definitely improve your analytical skills and with practice you can write even more awesome and complex games comment below what else you think we can do to make it more fun do you see
