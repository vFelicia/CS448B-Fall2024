hello and welcome to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun today we are going to create a tutorial on transitioning from fall to winter today is the first day of winter and it's called winter solstice so it's the day that we are transitioning from fall to winter and i'm gonna show you how in scratch you can implement transitioning from fall to winter so this is only one example but this is really useful when you are going to create animation and tell a story and you need to transition from one scene to another scene so when you're going from like for instance from outside your house to inside the house and then you move around the scenes it's very useful in games very useful in storytelling and it's so much fun let's dive in all right we're going to see how we can move from fall through winter by using backdrops um so let's go to the scratch website spanish.mit so create and then for this we need two backdrops for the things that we are transitioning to and from i'm gonna choose one backdrop of fall and one for winter and i'm gonna use the backdrops from from the images that i have already downloaded on my computer so you most probably already know how to download the image from internet so i start from here uh first thing let's give our project a name so i'm going to give my project a name winter solstice and then let's get started so i need two backdrops that i'm gonna upload the backdrop from images that are in my computer one for fall and one for winter and winter so if i go to the backdrops i should see both images here and there is also the default backdrop you can either delete it or you can keep it i would keep it but it's your choice i will keep the cat you can insert any sprite that you like it's totally your choice so what i want is i want this cat to be here in the fall first and then glides here and after it reaches the end of the the corner goes to the winter so let's write the code uh first thing i want to start with the full backdrop so i need to make sure that i'm on the fall backdrop first one point is if i click on the code here there is nothing under the motion because we are not supposed to move the backdrop motion code is only for this price so i need to make sure that i click on the sprite first and then i see the motion is here so let's uh trigger our event by writing the code when start clicked so when start clicked uh what i want is i want the cat to be here so i move the cat here when i move the cat here i see what is the position here so it says minus 189 on the x and minus 1 to 5 on the y so if i go to the motion and then i drag the go to the numbers here are also showing where is here and where i put my cat so whenever i'm dragging it like from here the value that i see on the x and y are the same as what i see here initially i can definitely change it but it's a good trick to set the values to where you want just move your sprite and then this will change and it will also change here so when i start clicked go to this location and now from the looks we need to go to the switch backdrop to um fall because i want to start from fall i also want to move the cat to the end of the scene so i'm kind of trying to tell my story so whenever you are creating your animation you also write your storyboard and try to create your story in the language of code so my next step is gliding the cat so i go to the motions and then i look for a glide i glide one second to so i could do it better by moving the cat here first to see the location so i would say this one this part is 205 one minus 115 so because i want the very end i would say maybe 2 10 and on the y this one all right let's say after the gliding i want this um cat to say something like goodbye fall i will say drag this block from the looks that says goodbye fall for one second let's try and see what happens now so the cat is gliding and saying goodbye fall let's also make it look like the fall or maybe somebody is answering back there is something very interesting here that if you click here so you have a set of codes here but then there are things that are kind of hidden that you can bring them from here so if you click here you can click on the text to speech and now you see some more stuff here so i say speak goodbye and then at the end i need i will be able to hear um the goodbye is being set back to the cat so let's test it so i click on the start say goodbye you see did you read it says goodbye and then after this i want to transition to the winter now again i sage backdrop so from the looks i switch back to up to winter when i went to the winter i want the cat to be at the beginning the left corner of the scene so that it looks like it's gone from here to the next scene and started again so i moved the cat here so that the glide so that the position here is set to where i want it to be so i drag this simply here and the position is already the value of the values of the position are already written equal to what i want so i go to this point and then let's assume i want to let special first run it so you say goodbye here back and i go here let's assume that i want the cat after this to go to here so i drag it here and then i say go to this location or maybe glide to this location goodbye so if you like to i drag this here and i say um this location is 0 and 17 so i glide to this location and i would say i would say hello winter for one second and then i also want to hear back hello so i can change the voice so that it looks like it sounds like the waves are winter and autumn are different so i change it to a different one so i set voice to giant and i speak hello cat let's test it goodbye hello okay really cool tutorial this is very helpful when you're gonna create animation and have a great winter ahead if you like the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next
