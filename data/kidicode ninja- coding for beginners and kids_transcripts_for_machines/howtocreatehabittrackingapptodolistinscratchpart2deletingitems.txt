hello and welcome to part two of the habit tracking app tutorial in this part of the tutorial we are going to see how we can delete items from the list so in the previous tutorial we've created a habit list using the list variable from here on the left so i made a list i named it the habit list and i could add items to the list so here the cat is saying what should i do with the list and wait so if i answer to the question so here it says if the answer is add then do something so if i say add then it's saying what shall i add and then i can say maybe whatever habit that i want drink eight glasses of water and then i enter and then i see that the habit is added to my list now i want to be able to delete this as well so what happens is when i'm answering what should i do with the list and weight this answer should be a variable so that i can assign add delete or other things to it so i create a new variable so i go to the variables and then i say make a variable and i name it command because i want it to be used for add delete or any other command that i'm adding to my list so i say okay now that i have my command variable and i don't want it to be shown here so i can uncheck this so that is not visible and then i'm going to again to the variables and i set the command to answer so whatever was the answer of here answer ask what should i do with the list so whatever the answer came i drag it i assign it to the command variable so i set command to answer make sure not to type answer but drag the answer from sensing otherwise it won't work so i have the answer if it was at i'm doing these things and then here i'm gonna create another structure like this another block of code like this and this time i'm gonna say if so everything like the previous time but this time i'm gonna say if the answer i need to take the operator to compare it with something so this time i want to say if the answer is delete from the sensing i'm dragging the answer in this case i want to ask a question so i drag the ask block i say what uh what is the item what is the number of the item that you want to delete so you see those items in the list they have a number beside them so i'm going to add some more things it solid run every friday because actually what should i add so i should say add and then hate salad at night another ad run every friday and so on so you see every habit has a number beside it so i'm gonna ask what is the number of the items you're gonna delete so i go to the variables and you see here delete for instance one of my habit lists so i drag this and then whatever was the answer i replace it with this number so i don't want necessarily one but i want whatever is in the answer so delete answer of my habit list this sentence doesn't really grammatically correct but what it means is whatever is the answer of this question delete it from my habit list and the answer of this question is one of these numbers so let's give it a test what should i do with the list delete and why did it not work so the reason it it doesn't work is you see this if is inside the other if it shouldn't be like that so i drag this out and i make sure that is on the same level like just under if not inside if but still inside the forever so now it should work i stop and then i play again i run again give it a moment oh this one is that a part so what should i do with the list deletes which number of item listed number 2 so i say 2 and 2 is not here anymore what if i want to delete all the items at once let's create another block of code to handle the delete all answer or the delete all commands basically so again i go to the control and if then and this time make sure that is under the if but not inside and just like last time if answer is you may pause the video and try to do it by yourself without looking at it this time and then start and try again and check it so if answer was delete all in that case let's go to the variable and see what we have under the list delete all of my habit list okay now let's start what should i do delete all and everything is gone if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next week
