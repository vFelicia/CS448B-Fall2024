hello hello hello you lovely scratchers how are you doing i hope everything is going great with you in this tutorial we are going to learn how to develop a pinwheel so the pinwheel is going to look like this so it's our own version of pinwheel is not looking like the traditional one uh so when i click the green flag after i click on the pinwheel it's gonna rotate and change color let's dive right in this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun so today we're gonna start with the cat except i'm gonna delete it bye now let's get to the pinwheel so if you search for pinwheel image pinwheel is something like this so let's go to the sprites and see what is the closest to it so in the sprites we don't have a pinwheel so we have three options either search a pinwheel image so pinwheel png and then download and import it or you can go to the paint and draw your own pinwheel but i'm gonna do a different thing what i'm gonna do is i'm choosing this uh snowflake so that is a little bit more creative i want it to be a bit different and i want to focus on the code rather than the drawing now that i have this i'm gonna choose a different sprite also for the handle i can maybe take the line or magic wind maybe i'm gonna take the line for the line since it's horizontal i'm going to customs and just rotate rotate i'm going to hold the shift so that i'm assured that it's on the 90 degrees and then i'm gonna make it smaller it's a little too big it doesn't fit in so let's make it a smaller now we have this beautiful pinwheel here and i want to make sure that this is at the top okay now let's get to the code so for the line we don't need to write anything for now only the uh the pinwheel itself is our construct now let's get to the code in this session i'm gonna also show you something which is called iterative prototyping so instead of developing the final prototype at first i'm gonna start from simple and then we go from version to version to see the final products now initially i'm gonna write it as simple as possible so i write it as when green flight clicked i just want to spin it from the control forever and then i go to motion turn 15 degrees so simple so this is simply rotating interesting but it still is different from actual pinwheel in an actual pinwheel when you blow on it it starts rotating as as a certain speed and then slowly slowly the speed reduces and then it is stopped so we are gonna simulate such a thing in this pinwheel in order to do this since i'm saying the speed is gonna reduce so the speed shouldn't be the turn degree in degrees it shouldn't be always 15. i need a variable it should be maybe initially 15 and then slowly slowly reduce and reduce until it becomes zero or like don't turn at all so from variables i'm gonna make a variable and i'm gonna name it spin speed okay when we have a variable we always need to initialize it so we need to give it an initial value i'm gonna set my initial value of the variable spin speed to zero for now and then i'm gonna turn spin speed degrees i'm gonna reduce this speed as we go so let's go to the set let's drag the set spin speed 2 i want to make it less so one way to make a value so one way to make that number less is to multiply it by something less than one so i would say set spin speed the new spin speed is gonna be spin speed multiplied something less than 1 like 0.97 and then at some point i need to stop so i need a condition the condition is checking for the value of the variable and then if it's too low so i'm gonna say how do i say too low i need a comparison if the spin speed is less than let's say 0.5 now i would say i want it to stop almost zero right so i'm gonna set the spin speed to zero so now the spin speed started from zero but it's never increased how do i want it to increase i want it to increase i want this the initial speed to have a positive value only when i click on the pinwheel so let's write a second piece of code for when we click on the pinwheel oh my god i deleted my code okay i did control that so that i get it back now i'm gonna make it a bit smaller so that i can fit the second part okay so far here we never gave a positive value to spin speed we want to provide value to the speed after we clicked on this spin wheel so i'm gonna write a different block of code which is saying when this sprite is clicked now go and check the speed so i put it if can condition if spin speed is less than something we're gonna decide later so spin speed less than something let's say maybe 10 we can later play but by the number and see what we like set it to 10 so i'm gonna set to 10. so what i'm trying to do is whenever i clicked on this if the spin speed is anything small i wanted to change it to i want to change it to 10 so i start from 10 so like when i blow at my spin wheel is rotating at the speed of 10. so i'm gonna test it nothing happened because i forgot to change this to spin spit so let's test one more time let me save and test so now it's rotating starting from the speed of 10 and then slowly slowly reduced because i'm multiplying it by a small number so this was iteration two now let's go to iteration three let's go uh let's play it with the colors so i'm going to the costumes and let's color the inside of the parts first so i'm just taking my bucket and then fill this change the color and then fill and again and one more time blue so all the colors anything you like just fill it i'm gonna take yellow here so all right now that is colored one more thing that we can do is i can change the color as it rotates so now it rotates and the colors are fixed without any change now let's go to the looks and take this change color effect by maybe not 25 but maybe three uh this is a little annoying on the eyes so let's also set this number in relation to the speed like the like the spin speed multiply but by something so change the color effect by again spin speed oops multiply 0.97 let's see how it looks so i click and it changes the color it is in a starts it starts with some specific speed and then it slowly slowly stops let's make it bigger number so just like this um let's change this one also to 40 so that it spins longer that's much better so this was iteration three what else we can do now let's see for the next iterations what else can we do to improve this how can we make it much better i have a suggestion i'm i'm proposing the idea but i'm not gonna make it in this session but if you know how to do it go ahead and do it and send the link to your project on the comment and you may win a prize if yours is a really good idea so what i want to say is for the next iteration instead of clicking on this make it move by your voice so so you blow like this onto your microphone and then the louder you blow it rotates faster so if i blow like this it's supposed to rotate really fast but if i blow slowly it's it rotates very slow so if you know how to write the code for it write it in the scratch and put a link to your project in the comment and you may win a prize so i hope you liked this video if you did don't forget to like it subscribe and
