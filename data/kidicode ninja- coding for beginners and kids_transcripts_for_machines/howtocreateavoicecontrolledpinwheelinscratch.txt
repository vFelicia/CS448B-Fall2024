hello you lovely scratchers how are you doing i hope you are all feeling awesome welcome back to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial we're going to learn to interact with virtual elements means the things on the screen such as sprites with our voice so instead of using mouse keyboard or anything else we are going to control the surprise using our voice the project that we are going to design is a pinwheel that can spin whenever i blow on it like this such a crabby pinwheel i have anyway stick around we're gonna see how to make it you're also going to learn to create on and off switch buttons in scratch without further ado let's cut to the chase so let's create a new project give it a relevant name i'm i'm gonna name it voice controlled pinwheel get rid of the tag and the cat and i need a pinwheel since the sprite is not already in scratch i'm gonna upload it from what i've downloaded from google image and i'm gonna put the link to the project in the description so that you can go and take the assets from there or you can download it by yourself so i have this beautiful pinwheel this was the part at the top and now i'm gonna add the pin as a handle now there is a line here let's take it and rotate it so that is all the way straight small and here we go let's adjust this a little bit to make sure that the pinwheel is at the top and the right position and also we need two buttons which is already here so just i'm searching for pattern and here i have it let's take maybe this one and i need two of it later we will see what i want to do with it okay now let's get to the code i'm also going to create two variables one the color effect and the other spin so these are going to be binary variables to use it for this with this buttons to switch on and off uh color effect and the spin so now i'm creating it later on you will see how i'm gonna use it spin the other one color effect oops color perfect okay in this lesson we are going to make use of functions and we will see how much easier our code will be read so to create a function i'm using blocks i'm gonna create a function for a spin i'm gonna name it like please spin or just spin easy and simple so here i should define what the spin function do so it's doing something and i'm going to define it the mistake i made is i define it on the line let's just make sure that this here as well okay now it's better i dragged it there and i'm gonna delete it from here now let's write the basic code of the spinning like the structure i run it like this when green flag clicked forever so going to control spin but in a certain condition let's take it another if then so i wanted to say by blowing here and based on the loudness of my voice i want the pinwheel to spin so in order to measure the loudness i'm going to sensing and there is something called loudness already in scratch for us but before i can use it in a comparison i should go to operator and take something like this so now i say if loudness is less than some number then going back to my blocks the function that i've already defined which was spin and put it here if loudness is less than let's choose a small number so that they don't have to shout then if loudness was less than two then spin but we didn't say what spin looks like we already only gave it a name defined it but it's an empty function now let's define it first and give it a test and see how it works what the job of the spin function is is to simply turn whatever sprite that it that is called on so in order to say turn forever i should take the forever and then go into motion and use something like this turn some amount of degrees so i play start and base on the loudness of my sound is turning let's change this to different number now stop save and start now i'm quiet oh why did i say less than i should say more that let's change this part first so let's take another operator and get rid of the right one so i want to say if loudness is more than something then start spinning start nothing yet the problem here is it did work but it is spinning really forever that's not what we want because now if i'm quiet i don't want it to spin because i wanted to make like like a real pinwheel so let's improve it a little bit here instead of turn 15 degrees now i can say turn loudness turn whatever the loudness number is so what happens is the louder i blow or talk or play music or whatever that i want to control my pinwheel with it the longer it spins i'm going to turn it down and i can also use some operator to make it a portion of the loudness or the loudness complete itself let's do it like this for and then you see it's so natural it spins and then stuff but right now since it's working with my voice now that i'm talking it's also rotating which it's not a problem that's how it works it can't distinguish between blowing or talking but it's really nice when you are playing a music with it is kind of like it's dancing with that music now you see how cool and easy is to read this function these two blocks of code it's a very tiny block it's very clear that here i only have a spin and if i don't want to know what is spin i don't have to be worried about it because it's already defined or i can just go in it and read it so basically what i'm trying to say is since the function is defined this part becomes something reusable and then someone that is taking the assets from my project can simply grab this code and continue on it and it's very easy to understand okay here is this one let's define one more function for the color changing or playing with the colors or giving it some sort of visual effect let's say we want to do the same thing that we did for spinning for changing the color this time so i want to have something saying change color or color effect here so let's say something exactly like this i just duplicate it here and then i'm gonna get rid of this creating a new block and naming it color effect now you see how easy it was to use this function again all i needed to do was change this part of the code which is only one black now i'm gonna define color effect here so again it should be or it can be maybe forever or maybe let's just say repeat times four times whatever number of times and then if you go to the looks there are some codes already for color effect that you are going to modify and use them let's say change brightness effect by again it's nice to make it a variable of the loudness to make it relevant to our project i'm going to take an operator here by maybe let's say this time loudness divided by four we write first and then we play with numbers and when testing we can figure out what numbers work best okay now that the color effect is defined i can also call it here so when i'm dragging something that i've already defined to my code it's called calling a function so here i'm defining the function here i'm calling the function let's add a part which says clear color effect so that when i clear graphic effects so when i start i start as a fresh status also we can add a weight here so that you can more visibly see the changes let's say for 0.4 seconds and let's try what's happening i'm gonna start so for three times the color is becoming less and less and less but it's not very obvious maybe i say this and testing it save first wow it disappeared so quickly because this number is very small anyway you got the idea of what is happening you see every time that is rotating for three times the color is becoming brighter and i can make it even more so you got the idea you can play with this numbers you see now i have more numbers for 10 times and until it disappears this is such a cool animation we created by this function and it's all controlled by my voice now let's write the code for those two buttons so what i want to do is i want to decide to use the color effect or spin or both of them so i create a switch to turn each of them that i want on and off all right i have two buttons let's give them a meaningful name the first one i wanna name it spin control and the other one i'm naming it color effect control or switch you choose what you want to put and let's go to the costumes for each of them i want to have two costumes for on and off situation so i'm going to this custom let's name this spin on spin off so for the off let's change the color to something that makes more sense for when it's off maybe red or orange something like that and also the outside or let's ignore the outside is not that white here i can write just to be clear wow same color with black spin is so when it's red it means spin is off then let's select it and make it a little smaller to fit in spin is off so you can just write off or on but since i'm explaining i don't want to cause confusion i'm writing it more explicit and a green for okay here we go i'm gonna change it to green and fill okay and i need to add a text now here color is on and make it smaller something i could do is here i should write spin is on so i have a button for a spin has two customs the spin on spin off see it was too much trouble to create this i don't want to do this again here i delete this and instead i duplicate from the completed one and then i modify here so i just need to name it color control and then on the customs change this to color on color off easy peasy and here as well color is on now i have two buttons one for color one for spin and they are both in weird locations so let's just adjust them and when i did make it so small make it size 100 the same here okay so what i want to do is i want to write a code so that when i press this i decide whether i want the my voice to affect the color or not or i want my voice to affect the spin or not so when i do this if with the spin button is on the pinwheel will rotate and when the collar is also on it will also use the color effect function that i've defined for it already but when both are off then none of them is supposed to work so that i can control which of these two functions or one of them or two of them at the same time can work now let's get to the code of writing the button how i'm gonna write it i'm gonna write it like this from the events when start click start or when green flight clicked let's give the spin you remember we defined the spin variable already let's set it let's give it an initial value so i'm going to set the initial value to 1. so spin is a binary has two values one and zero when it's one i want it to be turned on and when is zero i want it to be turned off so i wanna i want the default like when i run start my program i want the default to be on one i also want to make sure that so this is the spin that's in this location and this one is in this location so i click here to see the code so i say go to whatever is already here you see that this number which is the location of of this one also here i also want to make sure at the start at the beginning the costume is on the green one which is the on custom so switch custom to spin on now i want to say if i clicked on it so let's go to the events and that's nice that we have this when this is right clicked now go to the next custom so if i click i don't want it to be on anymore i want it to be off go to the next costume which is the off one and also change the spin value and variable so change the spin by one so what happens is when i click on this the custom color is changed and the spin value is changed by one so you see spin is one if i click again it becomes two three four but i don't want it to go until whatever number i want it to be only one and zero how to address this in order to address this i'm adding a second piece of code which is again when this sprite clicked forever if if the spin became more than one so if it's zero is okay if it's one is okay but if it becomes more than one then set the screen to zero so in this situation it will be only zero or one like set the spin to zero now let's see what happens so i click spin on the spin is zero i click off is one so it's either zero or one it won't go like two three four five here but what's happening is this pinwheel is not related to this button at all yet in order to make it relevant we need to make use of this variable that we have already defined so let's go to the pinwheel now that we define the spin variable and we have the spin button working we need to make use of the spin value inside the spin function on the pinwheel sprite so here i want to check the spin whether is one or zero only if it's one i want the spin to work so here i need an if condition control i'm adding an if condition an operator for checking the value of the spin and then the spin itself so if spin is one only then turn some decrease so right now let's save it first right now the spin is one and i'm talking so with my voice or this is rotating but if i click here this button is off and the value here is zero so what i'm calling the spin function is shaking the spin is it one it's not one so it never gets to the turn function so as you see it's not rotating anymore but the color is changing because we didn't write any code for the color button so i leave this one to you you can write exactly the similar code that we wrote for the spin as an exercise for the color and make sure to share whatever you did on the comment so that you can enjoy the exciting project that you made as well i really hope you like
