hello hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all doing wonderful in this tutorial we are going to develop a easter egg hunting game esther bunny has hidden eggs in various places in random places and our job is to find those eggs and gain scores let's see how we can make this if you're not familiar with what easter egg hunting is watch this the bunny is hidden yes ready when you found all the eggs we shared them out eating danny dogs has found an egg under a plant sushi sheep has found it in a bush peppa has found an egg in a tree george has found one finished welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun okay let's dive right in by giving a good name to our project easter egg hunting and then we're gonna start with the cat except we're going to delete it bye and now we need eggs there is an egg in the scratch but it's not colorful so i'm gonna take this balloon and i'm gonna duplicate it i'm duplicating only three because it's just for the purpose of demo but the more eggs you have is going to be more interesting of course those are a little big 20 or like make it 30 and the same for this one and this one so i make them smaller so these are not yet looking like egg but i can go to costumes first of all i want three colors so for the first one i keep blue for the second one i delete everything except yellow and for the third one i delete x everything except red if you wanted more eggs you can later on change this colors now to make it like an egg i'm gonna delete this part and this part and this part and rotate same here and same here we can add a bit of pattern to it so that is more history the same here and here oops what did i do all right good enough we have three eggs three eggs now we also need two backdrops so for the backdrop i'm gonna choose this forest and i'm also choosing another backdrop for when we are a game over which can be maybe this one let's also add a lot of sprites to cover the eggs because we want to hide eggs right so we need to have more stuff there i'm gonna choose a burr the the first backdrop i'm also gonna choose a butterfly you can just pick as many as you want take your time but i'm just gonna be quick maybe clouds all right just put them in the reasonable locations now it's time to write the code so let's write the code for the eggs we start by when start clicked since easter bunny has hidden the eggs in a random locations i'm gonna say to the egg to go to random position when the start is clicked and then i want to keep hiding and showing the eggs so i go to looks and since i'm saying i want to keep so i go to controls and take a forever and then i would say from the looks height and show with a weight in between so one one second wait after show and after between hide and show we need one more weight also except that we don't want all of them to be one second and so that the eggs are not appearing all at the same time instead we say pick random number between one two let's say seven so what happens is that this egg would go to a random location hide itself and then wait a random number and appears just like this one more thing that we need to do is keep track of the scores when we are collecting eggs so i'm gonna create a variable i'm naming it score and since this eggs are appearing forever we wanna have a finish time for when we assume all the eggs are collected we keep track of it using score so i'm gonna say every time i click on the sprite which is egg i'm gaining a score so under control i say when i'm looking for when this sprite is clicked so on the event when this sprite is clicked ink only if so let's go to control i'm gonna take an if else condition if score is less than something let's say i want to collect five eggs if the score so from the variables i'm dragging score is less than five let's play a sound start sound pop and also change score by one change score by one so every time i can catch an egg or find an egg i'm gaining one point and if score is more than five or equal to five in that case i want to finish the game and i'm doing it by broadcasting a message so on the event i'm taking a broadcast new message since we never created a message finished so broadcast finished now that i've broadcasted finish i'm going to backdrop and i add an event when i receive finished from the looks go to switch back drop to hearts and play sound win we need to bring it here sound i'm gonna add the sound when so going back to code play sound when and stop all the script because we're done done event it should be under control so stop everything since we are in the backdrop i'm gonna add when start clicked go to so like my initial setup is i want to be on backdrop forest and also i want the score variable to be zero set score to zero now we are pretty much done with the code except that we need to copy the coat that we wrote for the egg to other eggs as well which is done simply by dragging the coat on top of this we do it the same for this and this egg and this egg so let's test it i play start oh that's not good it went to backdrop two so let's go to here uh is here i put next backdrop what's wrong with me i should put such backdrop to forest other than this i think should be okay okay so score is zero backdrop is correct just look at the eggs any egg that appear i click oops it's pretty much difficult not so easy not so easy it's really fun though yay we won i hope you liked this game if you did give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe share with your friends and support my channel so that i can create more content for you it really helps by the way put in the comment what do you think we can do to make this project more advanced like yeah just comment below any opinion that you have any great idea i would like to see them thank you so much and see you next week
