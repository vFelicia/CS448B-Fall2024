hello everyone how are you doing i hope you are all doing wonderful have you ever wondered if there is a way to transport your things your items from one project to another one i have a good news for you there is a really cool feature in scratch that enables you to transport things like sparse pieces of code sounds and even customs from one project to another project you can transfer things from your own project or someone else's project and reuse it this feature is called a backpack using a backpack you can drag items from a project drop it in your backpack and reuse it in another project if you would like to see how stick around in a minute i'm gonna show you if you would like to support my channel so that they can create more content for you press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you will see my new video uploads welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right you can look at your backpack as something like a backpack that you carry around with you when you go shopping so now i'm in the scratch website so i'm gonna shop around for things that i need and drop them in my backpack if you look at here when you're logged in into your profile there is a folder right beside your name which yours which my stuff or your stuff are in there so if i click here i will see all of my my projects here so let's say i want to take something from my fishbowl project and then i also wanna take something from my flying santa project so i open both of them i'm also gonna take a couple of things from someone else's project within the scratch community so let's say i'm going to explore and then i just click on one random project maybe this one and then some items are there as well i've also created a new project by clicking on the create button now if you look at this part here the backpack is right here so right here currently the backpack is empty i'm gonna shop around and fill it with all the things that i'm interested to keep so let's go here say inside let's say from this one i want to take the um maybe this piece of code so all i need to do like is i click on the backpack and i drag this and put it into my backpack so you see that the code is showed up here in the form of script now if i go back to here and i refresh this one should be added to my backpack so that i can reuse it in my new projects so as you can see when i went back to this new project that i just created i'm just going to give it a name backpack tutorial so this piece of code has appeared into this script if i want to use it all i need to do is i can go to the code tab and i can drag it right to my sprite so i had a code for a jumping peppa pig now i've i've dragged it on top of my cat surprise so if i click here i should see by pressing space i can make this cat jump so without the need to rewriting it i could reuse it simply by taking it from my other projects and also let's go and see what this person named tn tent has in their project so i go see inside let's take a sprite from here so i go to my backpack i just drag it here and then when i refresh this one it should show up here and i should make sure that i save first one thing that is very important is when you take a piece of code or anything any item from someone else's project you need to make sure that you're acknowledging that this thing is copied from somewhere else and preferably you need to modify it a bit to make it your own version so what i can do is i go back and then i copy this link and this name so first thing you see that the sprite came here and when i'm gonna share it there is a part which is notes and credits so i should say thanks to the name of the person was t intent the id and taken from or like a project link and then i paste it here so that i've acknowledged that it's taken from somewhere else so i go back to inside my project again so now that i've taken this sprite from the other project this is available to me i can drag it here and then when i go to the code this sprite with the whole code that it has is now accessible from my project so if i click on the flag you see this sprite and all the code associated with it is here so we're not gonna go into the detail of that because the purpose was just to see how we can use it but you can go and check it out later we can also import sounds and even costumes so all you need to do is just go to the project of your choice maybe i go here and click on the part that you needed like sounds for instance here there is a sound if i want it i can just drag it to my into my back or like from here i can just drag it into my backpack the same for costumes let's say i have this santa this sunday is not a good example maybe this gift has two variations if i want to take only one costume it's still possible so i just drag it here and you see it appeared as the form of costume but not a sprite so i can have access to it from my backpack in any other project so you can look at it as a backpack you are taking with you to go to the shopping mall and shop around among the all the projects that are on the scratch community and using it for yourself this feature is very useful to create new projects much faster and without wasting time on things that are already built and is very useful when you want to continue on other projects that are already made and improve on the things within the scratch community if you like the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell and share it with your friends so that i'm encouraged to create more content for you see you soon next week bye
