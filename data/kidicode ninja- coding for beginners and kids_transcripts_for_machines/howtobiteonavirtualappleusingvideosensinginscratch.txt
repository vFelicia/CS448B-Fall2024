hello and welcome back to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial we're going to learn about video sensing video sensing is a way that we can interact with our scratch project using the webcam on our computer like this let's dive in let's go to scratch.edu.mit then we create a new project let's give our project a name video something we don't need the cat uh so we're going to make exactly the demo that i showed you so we need a sprite which is an apple for this sprite i look at the costumes it doesn't have any other costume so i duplicate it and then i delete the extra parts using this eraser so that it looks like it's been hidden okay so i call it apple and then we need the sound that is the sound of biting the apple so i'm gonna import that as well from the sound library i search for white since i already know it exists so if i import it and i don't need this one so i delete this that's pretty much what we need plus um so i click on this to make this my main sprite i also need to import the video sensing blocks so i click here and then i choose video sensing all right so the blocks relevant to it is there you might get a notification that asks you to allow the webcam in that case you need to say yes and now okay we say when start clicked first thing i want to make sure that this webcam is on this video sensing is on so i drag this turn video on and then i need to do two sets of actions one is relevant to the movements of this apple and the other one is about sensing the apple sensing my movements using my video and reacting to it through the apple like interacting with the app so i need to have a repetitive set of actions so i go and drag forever from control forever i'm going to move the apple and so like i want to move and turn and whenever i get to the edges i want to bounce back so that the apple is moving around so from the motions i would say move four steps and then turn um i don't want it to be 15 i want it to be random number so i go to operations and then i drag this one pick a random degree between let's see if i can make this smaller minus 30 and 30 and then i need i also want to make sure when this apple is hitting the edges it's bouncing back so there is a block of code for it in the motion which says if on edge bounce okay so this is about our movement and also i want another set of actions which is about interacting with the apple uh what i want is whenever my video motions is touching the apple in that case i want some change to happen like biting the apple so like when i wetting it i want the apple to be to look different so going to the operation i need a specific condition actually going to control if then block sit inside the fervor and i drag this operation for the sensing there is always need of this comparison so that we we want to define how sensitive we want the interaction to be like if do i need to really uh wave fast move fast or just a slow movement is enough so if i reduce the number it means that very little movements work if i make it bigger it means a lot of movement so go to the video sensing if video motion on sprite is equal to let's say 20 so like 20 movements is noticed under this apple in that case i want to do something which is i want to create a budding sound so i go to the sound first and then i say start sound bite let's play and see what is happening so far so so it worked one time so it means that i need one more forever for this apparently so i drag this let's try one more time that's what i want but i don't want it that fast i also want to switch to the shape of apple that looks like an eaten apple like this one so i say switch costume as well from the looks switch switch stitch switch custom to apple hidden it should be eat an apple but we know what we say i also put a weight here control control wait a bit one third of second almost and then height so i hide it so that it looks like the apple is finished and then switch back to the full apple castle switch back to apple switch back to apple um one more ways and then join the apple so look and show let's show the apple let's show the apple a tiny bit of weight again so i just keep waiting and waiting so that it looks like different apples are coming and go to a new position just a random position go to random position less right feel free to remix it and leave your projects in the comments see you next week if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next week
