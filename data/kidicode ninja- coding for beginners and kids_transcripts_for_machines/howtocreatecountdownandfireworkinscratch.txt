hello friends we are getting closer to the end of the 2020 and new year is about to arrive what i love most about the new year celebrations is the fireworks if you two like me love fireworks join me in this tutorial to see how we can create our own virtual firework in scratch let's dive in welcome to cuticle ninja tutorials this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right let's go to the scratch.mit.edu so that we can create a new project and then we click on the create on the left top corner and here we are when the project was opened we are going to create a firework for that we need a timer so we count using a timer we count down from let's say 10 to zero and then we shoot the fireworks so let's delete this cat so first thing we need a timer we go under click on the variables which is here and then i create i click on make a variable i name my variable timer also let's not forget to give our project a proper name which is firework fire break 20 21 okay now we have our timer i'm gonna set the start of the timer from by clicking on the variable so set timer to let's assume we're gonna count down from three so i set it to three and then change my variable by 1 and i want to wait one second between each count so on the control wait one second so set three wait one second change by minus one and i want it to be repeated over and over again so i change it to the large start so three we need to make sure that we have changed this to timer so i test it again now it's counting properly but the problem is it's gonna go below zero that's not what we want we want it to count until zero and then we wanna shoot the fireworks so what i'm gonna do is i put an if condition here so right after the change by 1 i'm gonna say if timer is equal is equal zero so i'm dragging this timer here if timer is zero in that case first thing is that i don't want to count down anymore first thing is i don't want to see this numbers anymore instead i want to see the firework so i'm going to hide this so under the variable we have the option of hiding the variable of choice so i drag this and i change it to timer so i hide this and also i want to broadcast the message of starting fireworks so i'm going to events and i say broadcast a new message and my new messages start firework so i'm dragging it here what else i want is i want to play the sound here so that when the countdown is finished the crowd is cheering and the firework is going to be started so i go to the sound and the sound and then i search for i know that there is the sound of cheer already in the scratch library so i choose this and then here star stand cheer until done i drag it here and since i don't want to count down anymore when i get to zero it goes in the control and i drag stop this script so i want this script to be stopped let's run and see what's happening so i'm counting down until zero and i don't see this anymore i hear the cheers and one thing is i broadcasted the start firework so another sprite is going to receive this broadcast message and react to it let's also choose a backdrop so i go here and then i click on choose a backdrop and i obviously need a night because it's about the firework which is in the midnight so i choose the stars this is my desired backdrop now let's also create the firework by choosing the firework sprite so i've already downloaded a filework png image with transparent background so i go to upload the sprite and i choose this so when you are searching for the image make sure you are searching free image png firework so when you choose a png image it's giving you the image with transparent background so there is no background and it looks like the background is the backdrop of my code here all right initially when i click the start i have some expectations here so i go to the events and i drag when start clicked first thing i want to make sure that i'm on the star background so backdrop so from the looks i would say show or like switch back to up to stars and i want to make sure that this is initially hidden so i'm going to hide this as well so this is for when start click i also had a broadcast message so i go here and then when i receive the broadcasted message which is which is start firework i'm gonna do a set of things all right so when i receive the broadcast um i'm gonna start from heart so initially the fireworks should be hidden and then i i need to wait a bit let's say a second wait one second or maybe half a second and then now height now show and i want it to happen repeatedly so i go to the control i can do forever if i want it to go on and on forever but i want to have a limited amount of time so that i can count it and after a day firework is over i want to say the happy new year message so i choose repeat 10 times height weight show so let's pick a start um so the countdown didn't appear let's go back to the backdrop and see what needs to be fixed okay so when the start clicked we need to make sure that the countdown variable is shown so show variable timer i test it again so now i see a countdown three times and then the firework is gone now we have the basic code but let's enhance it a bit to make this wire more natural we don't want every time that i'm shooting the fire the same position and the same size and color of the fire appears so what i can do is first from the motions i drag the code go to random position so before i show i go to random position and then i can also set the random size so i go to the looks and then i choose set size to instead of hundred i'm going to choose a random number so i go to operator and then i delete this hundred i drag the code pick random um let's say 20 percent to maybe 150 percent and then also the color i can make it different again going to the looks and set color effect to similarly from the operator dragging the pick random one two 100 so that the color is not the same as last time so this is what i have also i want to play the sound of fire so i go to the sounds i have two options i can also either search something from internet or choose something from the library i choose the library so i choose the library there is a sound which is called symbol which is quite similar to the fire if i make it slower it's more close to the farm a little faster and i can give it a fade out so it's even more like an actual firework okay so that's my uh sound going back to the code and then i go to the sound here i would say play sound symbol until done so after setting the color this is it this all right let's test it counting down make sure to show first and play sound second all right one last step is that we want to show happy new year after the 10 fireworks are done so i can do that using backdrop so i go to the backdrops again and i choose backdrop of the same backdrop again which was stars and then i go to my backdrops uh i have two stars now so i choose the second one and i give the name happy new year and here i want to add the text happy new year with the color of my choice which is yellow for me happy new year 20 21 and then just format it and then let's make it a bit bigger here we go so one last step in my code going clicking on the firework again at the end of my loop i'm gonna add switchback drop to happy new year so after 10 i'm gonna see that i've already said i want to begin with the backdrop of stars let's sing it for the last time now i have actual firework with lots of fires but then i don't want them all to appear at the same time so what i can do is i click on them and then give them the different wait times maybe this one two seconds and this one five seconds so that they don't show up all at the same time happy new year and see you next year with the new tutorials i will put the link to the coding sketch website in the description and you can go there and remix it and share your projects with us if you like the video
