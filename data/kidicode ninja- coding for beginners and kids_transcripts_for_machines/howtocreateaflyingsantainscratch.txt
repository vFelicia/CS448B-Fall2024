hello everyone welcome to another kitty code ninja tutorial this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial we are going to see how we can create a flying center left i mean flying center let's go to scratch that's mit.edu and then when the page was loaded we click on the create from here we're going to see how we can create a flying santa in order to do that we need several sprites we need a flying center we need a sky backdrop and we need some elements that show a city so let's delete this cat for the backdrop let's just choose the simple blue sky so i click on the search and then blue sky on this on the sprite i want to make it look like that the santa is flying on top of a city so i choose the buildings the nice thing about this building is it has several customs which are really different like different buildings so this is a good one and then i need a cloud we can have multiple but for now i just use one because it shows what i want to do but then later on you can add more then i need a sprite which is a flying santa so i go to google image image.google.com and then i search for flying santa png so that the background is transparent then i choose this one that doesn't have the background background because it's like pixely and then i download this so i download so i save it somewhere i name it flying santa and then i save i go back to my scratch i click here and then i click on the upload sprite now my flying santa is here i import it as i have this beautiful flying santa here now the trick is instead when i want to make it look like that this santa is flying instead i move the other elements on my page it still looks like this one is flying like when you are in the train and you're looking at the view or on a road trip and you think that everything is moving but you are moving actually so when i click the start this center should be visible so i would say when start clicked show i also wanted to say merry christmas so from the looks i take maybe for two seconds only say mary christmas so it's shown and it says merry christmas so good enough for now and then flying sensation so i do that by moving the building so i move the building and it will look like that the santa is moving so i want to start by having the building at the very right corner of the page so i would say when start clicked i set the initial position as set x to 250 which is the corner so if you look at this number when i move this 250 is almost here so i start by 250 and then i want to i want to take smaller steps towards the left so i would say i'm repeating my steps so i say forever repeat let's say 100 times and then taking steps by changing x by minus five so minus because i'm moving towards the left so five multiply a hundred as 500 which is the width of this this thing now if i click start that's what happens it kind of gives the illusion that this santa is moving not quite yet though i'm gonna enhance the thing by making some more stuff here so that it really would look like that the santa is moving so all right let's also give our project a name from here which is flying santa and then let's write a code for the santa to be able to interact with it i click on the flying center and then i want to be able to interact with the center by pressing my right left up and down arrows to control it so i would go to events and then when i drag this block of code i drag it four times or one time and ctrl c four times paste three more times space totally four and then i would say when right are up arrow clicked and when down arrow clicked and when right arrow and when left arrow clicked for this these four actions i wanna write a movement so for right arrow i would say change x by 10 for left arrow change x by 10 up arrow change y by 10 and for down arrow change y by minus 10. by the way i changed my santa to new one behind the scene um let's start i test it again so i go right up down left and everything is working very well okay now it's time to animate this cloud as well in order to do that i click on the cloud so i get to the code page of the cloud so i start by for ever i want a repetitive action and first i set the position so i would set y from motions i set y to a random position which is going to be from the operator i take pick random so i pick a random position i want the cloud to stay at the top half of the screen so above this line so i would say a random position between 1 2 180 so anything okay so set y to this number and set x to i will set it to 250 because i want to start from the right of the screen so the y somewhere random here but the x starts from here now i'm gonna repeatedly move the move the cloud so i would say repeat repeat i would take 50 steps and each steps i move x by 10 towards the left so minus 10 which means 10 months multiply 500 which is the width of the screen so i'm going to start i placed i didn't write when start clicked so i add the when start click so i test it i play start and you see the cloud is moving the santa is moving by my arrow key pressed it's pretty much looks like the santa is flying on top of a city something is missing santa without a gift is not a santa so let's add a gift as well so from the sprites i search for a gift i want the santa to drop gifts so i inside the gift is dropping the gift is similar to the way that we created snowfall effect in the last video so i start by clicking on the gift i go to the code and then i say when start clicked i wanted to go with the center so i say go to santa and at the same time i want it to be hidden okay now it's hidden with the scent then i would say when i start as a clone when i start as a clone i want to be first make sure i'm hidden so initially hide it still go to center because that's the starting point so i again repeat it here go to center and then go to the next costume because i want to try different colors of the gift box and now i want it to be shown so after it appeared we need to drop it down so i drop it by the repetitive movements like repetitive actions of coming down so i would say repeat until and then from the sensing i would say touching edge so it comes down until it reaches the edge how to come down by changing y by a negative number so one thing is missing which is we haven't created a clone yet so i go to the backdrop and i add this code of when start clicked let's say i want the santa to have 50 boxes of gift for 50 kids i would say repeat 50 50 clowns create clone of myself from the i not myself create clone of the gift and wait in between to give it some time wait one second so now let's play test it i play start santa is moving i can move it and i can drop the gifts for children such a cool christmas if you
