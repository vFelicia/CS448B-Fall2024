hi friends how are you doing i hope you're all doing great in this tutorial we're going to recreate our own version of cherry blossom stay tuned welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right first thing first let's give our project a good name cherry blossom i got rid of the cat already i need two sprites which i'm gonna draw by myself using paint one is the tree trunk and the other one is gonna be blossoms cherry blossom so brown for the trunk the bottom is white so i'm gonna take a big one i'm just gonna draw quickly but you take your time and do your best i'm gonna make it smaller now for the branches do now also let's use paint again to draw cherry blossoms which is pink actually i'm gonna use this circle and then when it comes to feel i go here to give it some like a shadow i need two colors so try to choose around pink and white so how do i get white like a pinkish white yeah this is what i like now draw one circle ctrl c ctrl we maybe four or five times put them together and then just group them so select everything and group now make the smaller and then ctrl c ctrl we and just spread it down another ctrl c ctrl v full of flowers all right now let's get to the code another thing we need is a sound from here i'm gonna choose the sound emotional you can obviously choose whatever you like but this is really cool i love it so romantic okay stop let's get down to the business um okay so getting back to the tree i'm gonna say when start clicked i'll look at this so cute one style clicked i wanna make sure that the location is staying where it currently is and i'm gonna show make sure it's visible so i'm gonna show it i'm gonna play that romantic song that we chose so sounds and then start sound what happened to the sound i chose oh let's bring it again okay now it's there start sound emotional piano and now i'm gonna broadcast a message to the blossoms from here using event broadcast new message start to bloom okay and then drag it here so this is the part for the tree now let's get this sprite so this one also when start clicked i want to make sure it's in the location that it currently is so go to this location so the number currently i see here corresponds to where it currently is in contrast to the trunk i want the cherry blossoms not to be shot so i'm going to hide it so this is the start position but when i receive start to bloom now what i do is i start from i don't want to be hidden i want to show it but i want to show it with ghost effect so i'm gonna bring change set ghost effect to some really big number so i want it to be like a ghost invisible and then i'm gonna show it so i'm gonna show it but invisible now in a loop i'm gonna slowly slowly reveal it so repeat a thousand times or whatever you want just a big number now let's slowly slowly increase the ghost effect actually decrease the ghost effect so that it becomes the ghost effect is gone and it's becoming visible let's start it's a real spring happy spring i hope you liked this video if you did make sure to press like subscribe and share it with your friends and also put in the comments how we can improve this share your cool projects on the comment below and bye bye and see you next week
