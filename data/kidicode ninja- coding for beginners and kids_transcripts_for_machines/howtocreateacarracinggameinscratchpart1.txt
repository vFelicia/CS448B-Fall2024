hi hi hi welcome back to another kirikou ninja tutorial in this tutorial we are going to create a car racing game best is eddie and this is your place to learn to go and have fun that's living okay let's get started let's give our project a good name for mola one and then byebye cat let's delete this cat we're gonna in we're gonna import the sprites that we like so you can go ahead and search for formula one top view and make sure you say png so that the background is transparent and then choose something and download it so i've already done that so i go ahead and upload it from upload sprite and i'm gonna download and like upload this okay wow it's huge let's make it like 10. okay pretty cool now we need a erasing area so let's go to the backdrop and draw it i click on the paint and then what i'm gonna do is choose a green color so that looks like it's grass and then paint the whole thing so apparently we need to yeah draw this okay so this is my background and then we need the road okay now let's take a brush and choose a color suitable for the the road and then also make sure this is wide enough so that the car feeling it i would go a little water maybe 100 and then i'm just gonna quickly draw this i'm gonna add a bit of cosmetic to it okay so this color and let's put some lines here with a very narrow one this time and then we need to start line so let's choose a different color also here red so this is our start line and let's write the code now okay let's start writing the code as usual first thing when green fly clicked so the first thing is that i want my car to go to the start line which is also the finish line because this goes one and several laps and by putting it here i've already set the location of x and y so i would say i only need to drag this go to minus one one two six which is where the card is right now and i also want it to the to point to the right direction so i would say turn or like point where is point direction point towards so point in direction 90 so like what is right now is 90 okay so this is the starting point and now let's write the movements i want to control it with left and right arrow as well as up and down arrows so so i go to events i want to control it by pressing right left up down arrow so when up arrow clicked if up arrow clicked i want to turn upwards so i would say motion turn 15 degrees i'm gonna test here so i'm pressing up so it's the other way around okay so in that case i should say minus 50 so that it works correctly okay and then if i say i'm going to duplicate this two more times so for a down arrow my car should turn 15 degrees so let me try it i'm clicking here and then i'm playing with my keyboard so i played down it's turning 15 degrees okay and then for up arrow for actually right arrow and left arrow for right arrow i'm gonna move forward so this time i don't need turn the same as this one i'm gonna move or maybe glide let's do move first see how it looks like so right move ten step and then lift move minus 10 steps okay so far i can control this car let's press start it goes to the starting point with right it goes here i press up turns down turns downward so so far this is movement okay in the next video we're gonna see how we can count the number of laughs that the car is taking in a certain time and also we're gonna see how we can change the speed of the car so that is moving faster here but it's becoming slower when it's on the grass one more thing we're gonna do is that we're gonna make the car collapse when is outside the road so when it's coming here it should sort of become slower slower and then crash so try to think about the solution of these three things if you know how to do it do it in your scratch and put a link of your project on the comment below if not join me in the next video so that we can do it together see you soon next week bye
