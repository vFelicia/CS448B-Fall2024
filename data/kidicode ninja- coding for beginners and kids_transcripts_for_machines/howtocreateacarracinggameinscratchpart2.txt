hello hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to see how to code the part two of the car racing game stick around welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right let's see what we have so far so in the part one we created the backdrop and the thrice and some basic movements in this part we're gonna control the speed and enhance our game a little bit more so i click on my stuff on this i go back again so that you can see so if i click on this folder i can find my previous project which is formula one i'm going to say inside i'm not gonna continue on this but i'm gonna create a new project so that this one is remained intact for those that are watching the first video but what i can do is i go to backdrop i drag my car here as well as this okay backdrop i can drag it from here okay so i have both of these the car and the stage uh the backdrop so what i'm gonna do is again i go back to scratch i'm gonna create a new project now and i'm naming it formula one part two part two and the dash in between okay here we go i delete this and now if i click on this backpack i have my backdrop here and i have the car here so all i need is here and even the code came with it now let's create a variable and name it speed so i make a variable i name it speed okay and then set the initial value for it as let's say 2 so any positive number if i replace it here means moving to the right or like forward and then one is negative is backwards so later on we can remove those numbers and replace it with variable speed now instead of this thing i can remove this and i can say instead change change speed by one and the same for this one change speed by minus one and then we will write a general code for the movements let's write a code for the movements of the car because we deleted the previous one so i'm gonna say when fly clicked forever so from control taking forever now i'm gonna write the move here with the variable speed so first i'm bringing moved and speed but then i'm deleting it and replacing it with speed variable so now the car will move and by pressing left and right i'm controlling the speed so let's play if i play it right it's going to be super fast if i click on the left the value is going to be less and less when it becomes negative it moves backward so let's stop it for now also let's put a weight here because when we are holding the the button it would automatically wait so going to control and wait one second here and wait one second here so that the changes are not super quick and we can see what's going on so we have a bit more control here in order to make it easier to control the car we can write a piece of code so that when the car came to the grass the speed is less or it's zero or whatever we want so let's write when green flight clicked now let's write a sensing condition with sensing so i would say keep checking so forever keep checking this if touching the green color set the speed to we can say 0 if you want it to be completely stopped or let's say one so that it moves but slower so let's see how it works so let's say if i accidentally went to the grass now my speed is one so i have more control over the car to put it back to where i want it to go because it's not going super fast okay and also we could one more thing we can do is let's go to the car costume and duplicate it i want to make it look like is exploded not like this oh my god i can't even go back okay let's redo it duplicate and then let's change this color i'm gonna choose like something like a fire and then just do it like this so that make it look like the car is exploded so i can say for instance i can put some barriers or like some sprites let's say this color or yeah so let's say i want the car to explode when touching this you can of course play with the slice and put something more reasonable but i'm just showing the code just saying what other things you can do to enhance this game now i'm gonna say going back to the car so i'm gonna duplicate this block i'm putting it here oops okay this time i wanna say when touching this color in that time set the speed maybe to zero the car stopped and change the costume to next custom or let's check what is the name formula 2 so switch custom to formula two so whatever i touch this i should see this let's go here here here keep going keep going rotate so i want to make it it's not even easy to touch this but i'm gonna deliberately bring this here so that i can demo so if my car is hitting this it's gonna explode and stopped so after this we can create a game over screen so there are a lot of other things you can do with this game you can put maybe some other items here so that the car if the car is touching those sprites can speed up you can also try to see how to counter the number of laps and then you can start to finish the game after like two laps three laughs or whatever you like so this is the base of the game the car can move you can control the speed you can rotate and from here you can go on and add as many features as you like to it and make sure to put in the comment what are the amazing things that you can do with this project i hope you liked this tutorial if you did don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the
