hello and welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial we're going to see how we can create amazing visual effects using clone if you don't know what is clone this is clone okay so like always let's go to scratch.mit.edu and then click create and wait until the interface is opened okay now we are going to see how we can use clone and how we can create visual effects here so we can use this cat but we can also use a different sprite so i delete it because i just prefer difference right so i click on choose a sprite and i use this one so let's go to the event and everything starts with the clicking on the flag so i say once start clicked i want to create a clone of this so under the control there is something called there is a block create a clone of myself so i drag it here so i expect when i click the start a clone of this sprite should be created so i click the clone is created but i don't see it because this clone is under this one so if i drag it i see the other the other one now let's do more things with this clone now that i have created a clone i can use a block of code which is under the control that says when i start as a clone so i drag it here when i start as a clone let's move it away okay when i start as a clone i can do various things with the clone that is created after this quote i want to say for instance move 10 steps so i say move 10 steps so a clone is created and it's moving a bit forward like 10 steps in order to make it a bit more visible i say 50 steps so that you can see the change so creates a clone and moves 10 steps now if i want this cloning to be repeated i can use the repeat or any of these codes that can be used for repeating things i prefer to choose this one repeat 10 times for instance or 15 times now i can create another clone so i go to the control create clone of myself again so i start as a clone i move 10 steps and then i keep repeating creating another clone let's see how it works i press start you see very quickly 15 clones are created but i don't see all of it because it's outside this in this stage in order to make it more like animation i can put a weight in between this so i go to control again and then there is this weight so i say first wait maybe half a second or 0.3 seconds and then create a clone so now let's see how it works now you see super cool okay so this was one way that we can use cloning to create visual effects now let's do let's see more examples let's see some more visual effects that you can create with this code to make it more interesting in order to do that i go to the looks and then let's say after creating each clone i want to give it some color effects so i can create after i created the clone of myself i go to change color effect by 25 so i play start you see this colorful characters are created and then another thing we can do we can change the size so if i drag this here change size by 10 so i expect that the next clone would be 10 times bigger than the first the previous one so if i click start this is what i see uh one thing that i can do let's reduce the repetitions maybe make it five so that we can see uh more clearly what's going on and then i want the new clone that is created don't go under the previous clone i want it to go on top of it so now you see everything goes under the previous clone but i wanted to go on top of the other one so i can use the code go to front layer so move 50 steps or maybe less steps 10 steps and then go on front of go to the front layer so let's play so it goes on top of the other one so the overall strategy of using clones is initially when you click the start you create a clone and then you start as a clone and after that you are free to do various things with repeat shapes and movements so that you can generate amazing animations i'm going to leave the link of this project in the scratch website below in the description so that you can go there and check it out feel free to ask your questions on the comment below if you have any i'm happy to help you happy learning if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss another tutorial see you next week
