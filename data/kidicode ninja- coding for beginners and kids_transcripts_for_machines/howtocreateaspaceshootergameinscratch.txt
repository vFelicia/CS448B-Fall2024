hello everyone how are you doing i hope you're all doing wonderful i'm back with another tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to see how to create space shooter game this is a this is your place to learn to do it and have fun in order to support my channel so that i can create more content for you make sure to subscribe like and hit the bell so that you can see my new uploads and also make sure to share with your friends so that other smart people like yourself can see my videos so let's dive right in all right let's see a demo of what we're gonna make first i need to hit the rocks and i also make sure i'm not hitting the stars so if i hit the stars i'm losing points now let's see how we can make this okay let's see what we need in order to make this game we need a couple of items that i'm gonna use and i'm gonna add first let's choose a backdrop there is a space category so i go right away to this space and then i'm gonna choose galaxy this one is also a good one i'm gonna choose this so i also need a couple of sprites i need rock so rock and rocket ship so both of them searching again my internet is a bit slow today but that's okay rocket ship and then what else let's put a star so i want to have star and rocks both of them i want to come from this from the sky like from the top and then if i hit the star i'm gonna lose point and if i hit this the rocks i'm gonna get points so i also need bullets because this rocket ship is supposed to shoot at the items that are coming from the top so there is no bullet i'm gonna paint it by myself um the way i do it you can also download the image but anyway i just decided to do this uh so i draw two squares and then using the line i'm gonna draw a line like a rectangle here and then with paint i'm filling it using this one i'm gonna make it look like fire it's not really like it but let's let's just say it's similar who cares uh not bad at all oops what did i do okay i'm quite happy with what i made so i'm gonna select all and group them together so i have a bullet let's also give it a good name uh so let also my project doesn't have a good name yet so i'm gonna give it a name space shooter safe shooter okay okay i have all items here we go and let's set the sizes to a proper size right here so i want this one to be smaller much smaller 20 is good the rocks it can be half of the size 50 stars still to be 30 too small 60 60 is good and then rocket ship is also too big for this screen okay now all the items are here ready to go let's start by writing the code for our rocket ship i want to control this to go right and left by pressing my right and left arrow key i also want to have a variable to track the scores so first let's create a variable make a variable and i'm gonna name it score i want it to be for all surprise so i want it to be available to allspice so okay so i have the score here and then so just when start clicked let's zoom in a bit so that you can see when clicked let's say i want it to be here at this position so i put it here by my mouse and then when i go to motions this x and y are already set to what i want so minus 2 and minus 140 and i also want to initiate my score i want the score to be to be zero variable variable where are you score score is here so set score to zero what else now i'm gonna say i'm gonna control it with if so to if then i want to say if i'm pressing right arrow do something and if i'm pressing left arrow do something else from the sensing i can say if key right arrow pressed do this and if left arrow pressed do the other things and the thing that is going to be done is a motion i want to direct it left or right so if right change x by 10 if left change x by 10 so i'm dragging it and then i'm changing this number let's see how it works i press start and is that i forgot to put a loop so i didn't say that i want to repeat something so let's go to the controls and then i want to repeat this lines of code so that's i don't need to click on this every time so repeat until i i want to have a condition what is the condition i want to go left and right by pressing the arrows until the rock the rocks is hitting the rocket ship after that i want to be game over so i repeat this only until is i'm touching that my rocket ship is touching the rock so going to the sensing and then so repeat until touching rocks so i put it here and now i expect if i press start or flag this goes right and goes left by pressing so i'm pressing right and left it should keep repeating itself and it only stops when this rock is hitting this rocket ship okay so far so good now let's write the code for rocks and for star if you have watched my snow falling video it's almost the same concept we create by the way i'm gonna put the link below so that you can check the snow as well it's very similar to this one when the snow is coming down it's the same as when the rocks and the stars are coming down so the strategy is creating a clone so when start when fly clicked create a clone of repeat like 10 times and then go to control create a clone of myself also i want to make sure that the rocks is visible initially and then when the clone is done i want to hide it so first i show it so i want to start with the rocket be available and then when the clones are made and the tasks are done i want to hide it so so far like this and then when i start as a clone where are you well i okay under control when i start as a clone what i want to happen is i basically want it to come down how do i do that i create a variable and i name it vertical speed and i want it to this is very important make sure to choose only for this sprite otherwise it's not gonna work properly so make sure to choose only for this sprite so that it's the local variable what i want to do with this i'm gonna hide it how to hide a variable just go to variable and uncheck this from here i only want to show the score on the stage now when uh i start as a clone i lost my sentence uh okay i want this vertical speed to be changed so let's go to operator and then i'm gonna set the value for it so set vertical speed to and then from operation a random number pick a random number i'm gonna give it a random negative number since i wanted to choose i wanted to use it for y direction and coming down so i say minus 1 2 minus 5. in a minute it will all make sense what why i'm doing it so for when i when we start as a clone i did set the value for my vertical speed other than that i need one more initialization which is the location of this rock i want this rock to be to start from the top but it can be anywhere on the xaxis so i wanted to go go to i want x and y i wonder why to be always at the top so i'm gonna so like where it is already or maybe even higher so that it's coming from really high and then for the y since i'm saying anywhere on the xaxis it can be a random number so pick a random number anywhere between left and left to almost and left to and right so now i know the clone starts from the top and anywhere here so like the rocket ship we want a set of steps to be completed repeatedly so i go to repeat until until a condition and the condition for game over in this game is when the rock is hitting the rock star so repeat until touching rocket ship and then after this condition is met we are game over so i would go to control and then i'm gonna broadcast a message game over not control sorry i go to events and i broadcast i need to create my new message i'm naming it game over so i want to say if this touching happened broadcast message game over then i'm going to broadcast this use this broadcasted message to show the game over screen now let's complete this one so what i want to happen before touching the screen obviously i want the rockets i want the rocks to come down so how to say i want it to come down by changing the y direction so i need a motion so i'm gonna say change y by not by 10 but by this very close bit which is already defined here one more thing i want to say is uh so this rocket is coming down down down and when it gets to the end i want it to go back up again and come down so it's repeating until touch unless it's touching the rocket shape i'm changing the one and then when it came here so i'm saying when it ha this thing happened if this thing happened if so it means control if if my new location became something like what it is right now so if my y location is less than something which is right now this is minus 172 is less than minus 200 for instance or it can be even less um i want to say under motions i choose y position if y position is less than this number go to the location that it originally was so i just need to copy this part of the code in order to do that i'm gonna separate this and then i duplicate this so that i can put it here i want one more of it as well i'm putting it here for now come on come on come on go back okay so so far so good right the code for when we are heating the bullets are hitting the stone so another if condition for changing the score so if something happened the score should go up so from the variables um change score by 10 for instance or anything you want so if something successfully happened we want the score to be changed and then i also want the position of the rock at the position of the rock go back to the top again so i'm hitting the rock the rock should basically disappear and a new rock is going to come from the top so i'm going to drag this how do i say that i successfully shooted the rock i can say i can simply say if touching the rock is touching the bullet so from the sensing if touching bullets if touching bullets score is added ten ten score is shaved and then this rock should kind of disappears how do we say disappear is that it just goes up again so that is it looks like a new one is coming so let's give it a test and see so now this rocket is hitting the rock so the code stopped i'm not the things are not repeated uh and i only got 20. technically after this i should be game over but we have not yet programmed the game over part we just broadcasted the message but not yet completed let's also make it a bit fun because currently when i'm hitting this i don't hear any sound or anything so just let's add a sound so i'm gonna i'm going to the sounds actually this sounds and let's search for anything related to space so i want to play a sound for the time that the bullet is hit or the rocket or bullet is hitting the uh basically when the rock is heated i'm gonna choose this and i'm gonna play with it a bit make it slower so it's like this the rock is exploding so boom cloud i did add it here and then also let's add it to the code as well so from the code and the sound at this point that the bullet is touching the rock i'm gonna play sound boom cloud until done so we're done with this one now the star is also have has all the same codes so i'm gonna copy that and then i'm gonna modify it a little bit so that they are differentiated so how to copy every code that is for rocks to start i simply click i stay on the rock i drag this on the star and i also drag this again on top of the star so if i go on the star i should see both of the codes here so i'm just gonna make sure i'm putting my mouse at the top so that everything is coming to the start now is what i want alright so now is the time to rename this one to start vertical speed and then i say okay i press start now the variables working for both of them so stars are coming down rocks are coming down as well in order to differentiate them um maybe instead of 10 star i only put three because i want to avoid hitting the stars but i i need to hit the rocks in order to win so if it's too many stars it's gonna get difficult and i'm gonna lose score when i'm hitting the stars so instead of positive i'm just gonna lose two scores maybe and then i want the speed of the star to be slower so i go only until minus three so now they are 12 different shapes now let's program the bullet this is the fun part this is a part that the bullet is shooting up by pressing spacebar so initially when flag is clicked i want it to be hidden so it looks like it doesn't exist and then when i so first hide it so let's say it looks like it doesn't exist and then when i'm pressing my spacebar so from events when space is clicked i want a clone of it to be created so control and create a clone of myself cyclone is created and then i want this clone to go to the same location that the rocket ship is located so i say go to go to i delete this numbers i just say how to say the location of the spaceship first go to sensing and then this is a bit tricky you won't see it first there is a code which says backdrop of stage change stage to rocket shape and then you will see exposition so drag it here and then again drag it here and change to y position so what i want to say is whenever i'm pressing the space spark key a clone is created and then when i start as a clone i go to this location so i should say when i start as a clone i go to this location and then in order to say how to shoot it a movement is required so change y by maybe like 10 steps each shooting let's see what happens start so something that's not correct here let's see what is wrong so few problems here firstly not set y to 10 but change change y by 10 second is when i start as a clone it's still hidden so make let's show it first then this needs to be in a loop because i want to keep shooting so repeat until repeat until hitting the rock or yeah that's a good strategy we can always try test and see how best works so repeat until repeat and not repeat just repeat until um repeat until repeat until touching so i go to sensing and then i take touching the bullets touching the rock so touching rocks it might work now i think let's test so i press start um it's not yet moving so again let's see what he's wrong so here accidentally when i start as a clone i show it and this go to this location is accidentally dragged inside so it should go back up only change y should be inside all right and then at the end the clone should be deleted so make sure we're deleting the clone as well which is on the control start so now it's working perfectly now the last part is to be able to show the game over we did already broadcast the message game over but no one is saying it uh in order to show the game over i'm going to my backdrop so backdrops i'm creating one more backdrop by duplicating this and i'm naming it game over and then i'm writing the word game over on it i'm gonna choose the font pixel you can choose anything but kicks pixel is quite good for the games so i'm gonna write game over and i want it a bit bigger so i'm just clicking on here i'm selecting it and then i'm dragging it so i have this nice game over screen and then i go to code i say when so when means an event when i received game over i go to backdrop switch back drop to game over also the initial state which is when flank is clicked i want the backdrop to be just like a galaxy so switch back drop to galaxy switch backdrop to game over for game over and i want to stop all the scripts so that it's actually all things are done so i stop all a sound for the losing so i go to sound library i add let's see if there is anything for there is and it's not bad so i'm gonna add it so backdrop go back to the code so switch back drop the game over play sound lose until done and stop everything so let's play the game so i press start why did i game over i think i hated the rocks so let's play again oh so something i need to fix here there is a bark when i'm hitting the stars i'm gonna get game over that's not what i want because i shouldn't hit the stars so i'm very likely to hit them so what i'm gonna do is on the stars i don't want it to be repeated until touching rocket ship instead i want this to happen forever so i won't lose if the star or the rocket the star and rocket ship are touching each other so i put it here and then i put forever instead and here we go let's play again so two more changes is needed i don't want to game over when i'm not hitting the stars so i take this off and i take this off as well so now should be okay i hit that rock okay that was a really fun tutorial i hope you liked it and i hope you learned something uh if you did make sure to press like subscribe share it with your friends also there is a lot of room for improvements
