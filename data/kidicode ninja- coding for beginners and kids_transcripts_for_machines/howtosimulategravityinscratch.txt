hello scratchers how are you doing i hope you are all doing wonderful in this video we are going to implement gravity in scratch what do we need to learn about gravity gravity has a lot of applications in games if you're a gamer you probably know flappy bird super mario and many many platformer games that requires jumping and falling why is that relevant because when i when you jump off really high you don't just keep up going up come down because of the gravity wait so without further ado let's cut the chase welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right so first thing let's define the event so when start clicked let's say i want to start from when the cat is in this location so i drag it to the location that i want and as a result i can see that this two numbers minus 31 and 89 are updated with my movements so you see as i drag it here okay now let's see how falling would look like how about if we say forever so from control forever change y by a negative number like small minus one steps being repeated forever so like minus one minus one minus one until forever so what happens if i click start okay i'm gonna attach it to this one so that it knows after start i want it to happen so it goes down but it doesn't look like it's falling because how about the gravity if it's if it if the effect of gravity was uh included it should not go down at the constant speed it should become faster and faster and faster as it's falling down so it should be much faster when it's going when it's getting closer to the ground so in order to in order to fix this as i said i do not want a constant value for the speed but i want a variable so i'm gonna define a variable and i'm gonna name it y velocity so this is the name that is commonly used for this situation is basically the vertical speed but i'm just using the name that is often used so that when you see it in other codes you will recognize it easier so wait y velocity is basically the speed across the y direction so i'm gonna put the y velocity instead of 1 and i'm gonna set my variable also to minus one so far nothing is changed so i only used the variable and i assigned the same value to it but now i'm gonna use this variable in a better way and something is wrong here which is i forgot to change this to y velocity so i change it first one more thing i'm gonna do is so so far i've only replaced y velocity with minus one so still the same but i want the y velocity to be changed in within every loop so what i'm gonna do is change y velocity by minus one so every round that this loop is executed the speed is changed to one negative one more negative one so i'm going to drag this here and then if i play so now you see it's kind of like this actually the cat is falling and the speed is increasing in order to show it better i'm gonna put a weight here so a bit of weight okay now you look at this number you see it's slowly slowly increasing it's not the more it comes down the increase is also more so the closer it gets to the ground is coming down faster okay now let's get rid of this weight i'm to create also a new variable and i'm going to name it gravity and then i'm gonna add one more step which is setting the initial value for gravity not initial just like setting the value of gravity to let's say one or it can be less if let's say i was on the moon or depending on the amount of gravity that i want depending on how hard i want it to fall down i can change the amount of gravity and then here instead of saying change v velocity by 1 i'm gonna use gravity here and i'm gonna change it by velocity minus gravity o y velocity minus gravity come on here okay go go go up okay now it's good also i can change it back to zero y velocity because gravity is gonna reduce it anyway now let's see what happens the good thing about writing this way is let's say i'm gonna go to the moon and the gravity is much less just let's say 0.2 now it might be even less it's becoming faster actually so if i put it one um it's not actually much noticeable let's say if it was 10 a really huge gravity is super fast but if it's like this number very much slower i mean the increase of the speed is much slower okay let's also experiment with changing this initial y velocity to a different number right now that is zero i'm aiming to just right away go down but what if i change it to a positive value let's say i'm putting 12 here so let's see what happens is it goes up a bit first it didn't come back oh the reason is not coming down is actually here i need to set the velocity to this number but not not but not changing it so let's drag set y velocity 2 and then this value and this one the top one was wrong so i put it here so i'm gonna set the y velocity to some positive number so that the cat jumps a little bit up and then down so look once more it goes a little up and then comes down so now let's make it a little more interactive so i'm gonna change this back to zero and then i'm going to control the cat with my space bar so that when i'm pressing this face bar i want the cat to jump up and then when i'm releasing it i just wanted to let the gravity uh pull and pull it down so i'm gonna put a key if space i just want to put it right up if the space key is pressed from that sensing if q space press only in that situation i'm going to set y velocity to a positive number so set set y velocity to maybe seven and now let's see so with space actually so if it's not pressed i will put this back and also this one out so now with pressing the space i'm controlling it but when i'm not pressing so if you listen to my keyboard i'm pressing it goes up i'm releasing it goes down it's very useful in game development if you follow the line and could make the same thing congratulation i hope you liked it if you did don't forget to press like and help me to be known in this youtube ocean share with
