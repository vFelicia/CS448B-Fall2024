hello friends how are you doing i hope you are all doing wonderful welcome back to another tutorial in this tutorial we are going to create a colorful piano welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun so let's start by giving our project a good name so just let's give it colorful piano and then let's invite this cat to join us in another project by deleting it now it's time to choose our sprites so i'm gonna choose something for instead of the buttons on the piano i'm going to choose this ball because it has a lot of costumes but feel free to choose anything colorful like this button this button you can definitely play with colors so i'm gonna show you on the ball and then you can do whatever you prefer what i'm gonna do is you see this ball has a lot of costumes so first thing um let's get back to the piano so in order to have piano i need to insert or like import the set of codes which are relevant to the music so i'm going to add an extension from here music extension so now you see i have this one here so what i need is something to play notes with so if you look at this one the nice thing about it is if i put my mouse here i see the shape of piano and all the buttons here so we have eight white buttons and there are five black as well i'm not going to make the black ones to make my video a bit shorter but it's the same so i'm going to create eight balls so i'm duplicating and duplicating until i get eight of them so three four five six seven eight so five six seven three four five six seven eight okay cool now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna lay them in a line so i'm gonna assume these are the buttons of my piano something like this okay and now each of these buttons correspond to one of these so like the first one is gonna be c72 so i'm gonna give them the relevant name so that is easier and i won't be confused when i'm writing my code so i'm renaming the first one to c72 which is the same as what i see here so c 72 and then i click here c74 and so on for the rest so see actually i need to make it d74 so obviously i'm not a musician e 76 f77 g79 three more a81 you may want to follow along so that you finished together with me b83 c84 okay what i want to do is i want them to have different colors so i'm going to costumes and then i changed this to this and then this one for here so what i'm gonna do is put the color that i wanted the first one and then i'm gonna delete the rest of the costumes and create the custom of my choice instead of this so in a minute you're gonna see what i'm talking about so one two three four so i'm short of three colors what i'm gonna do is for this one i'm creating my own color which is what to choose maybe red yeah so this one is good i need two more colors this one maybe dark blue or something like this and this one i need one more for here which can be um what color do we like maybe this one or something dark hair maybe now i have eight different colors here what i have to do is i need to make sure the order is the same as what is on the piano so c72 is here so just make sure to double check d74 should come here so put them in order the pink one is here this is good and then g and then the red one so i'm looking at here the order so to make it uh look like as it appear on the actual piano because each of them is reflecting a note on piano so now one more thing is i want to have costumes now so i'm gonna delete extra costumes that i do not want and for each of them i'm only keeping the first one here the same same same same same thing so i'm just gonna repeat this i'm deleting every extra costume and i'm only keeping one first one so delete delete delete and delete this this is this actually this color is too similar to my blue one so i'm going to change this so i'm going to change the blue to a bit more yellowish or i think why we don't have enough colors okay now it's good it's much more different so going back to costumes i'm gonna rename this to custom one and i copy this i'm gonna do the same for all of them it helps me to be able to copy and paste the code to all of them when i write the code for one i copy and paste it since the names are the same so same here same here this and this okay so one more thing is for each of them i'm gonna duplicate the costume so i'm doing it for all of them again duplicate and duplicate and duplicate so every button on the piano i want it to have two customs the reason is when i'm pressing the button i want it to look differently so i want it to look like as it's pressed how do i show expressed by simply pressing it so just like this and i'm gonna do it for all the custom tools so here and here and here two more okay now are our surprise are ready and it's time to get the fun started we're gonna write the code uh so first thing in my code is i wanna start from the position of custom one so no button is pressed when the game is just being started so when start clicked and from the looks i'm gonna switch custom to custom one this code should be copied to all of them where did i write it here so for copying i put my mouse here and then i drag it to here i should do it for all the sprites so to here and this and this and this and this and this which one is missing this one so also this one doesn't have the second one i'm gonna copy to this as well so let's double check and make sure everyone has that piece of code when a start clicked switch to cost someone so by this i'm making sure when i'm starting everyone starting from the round shape this one doesn't do it what could be the reason switch custom to custom one customs custom one the reason is i need to swap this too i rename it to one so i first give it three and then this one two and this one one so now the full shape is custom one and custom two so okay now they're all good now how to play the piano it's very easy all i need to do is for each sprite let's say c72 all i have to say is there is a code on the events when this sprite clicked so i drag it here and then from my music i'm taking play note which i've already done so the name of the naming of the sprites is going to help me right now here so you see this one is c72 so i say by playing this sprite play the note 72 so this one is equivalent of this button on the piano and then i should do pretty much the same thing for all of them except there are two more steps what i want is when this one is pressed i want it to be squished so from the looks switch costume to custom 2 so it's squished but i also want it to come back so what i do is first squish then play so that i have like a few uh moments of delay in between so now i'm gonna go back to custom one let's see how it looks i start i play it goes down and then it goes up so simply the same thing can be done for every other button so all i have to do oh we have a problem here one start click switch to custom one okay now i'm pretty much done all i need to do is to drag this to every other sprite so that all of my buttons are working so this and this and this and this and this okay now i have a working piano not yet let's check all of them have the code first so this one has something extra so i just click over everyone and check everything is okay this one is an extra this one doesn't have the coat at all so i'm gonna copy for it this pink one as well so i'm gonna do it here this one worked this is copied multiple times so this is correct here is not copied at all so which one was it here so let's drag on top of this as well this is good and this is good and this has some extra stuff so all cleanups and nice and okay now now let's fix this number so when i'm pressing this one i'm playing the note 72 when i'm pressing this one since this right num name is 74 i'm also playing the note 74 i can also verify it by checking this numbers so the same here i'm it's very simple i'm just checking the buttons on the piano comparing with this number the location so this is the third one so it's 76 76 so all good and in order here the green one is the fourth one so one two three four seven seven one two three four five fifth one 79 and after 79 81 two more to go so in a minute we are gonna have our very own colorful piano and the last one 84 tada one more thing that we can do i'm gonna show you on one of them is that instead of kicking with the mouse you could also make them to react to the button on our keyboard so i could instead so what i can do is i duplicate this piece of code i'm putting it here and then instead of when this sprite clicked i would say when for instance button a clicked so for the first one if i click button a on my keyboard so if you listen i'm pressing button a on my keyboard i also can play music so you can do that with all the for all the colorful piano buttons and associated with a key on your keyboard as well this was a nice easy beginner tutorial and i had so much fun i hope you too
