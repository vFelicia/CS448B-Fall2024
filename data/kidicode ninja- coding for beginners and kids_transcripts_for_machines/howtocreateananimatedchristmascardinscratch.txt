hey sami what are you doing hey i'm writing christmas cards by my friends oh really yeah that's really cool have you considered creating your own card in scratch can we do that yes you can join me in this tutorial to show you how we can create our own card in scratch hello and welcome to kirikou ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun let's see how we can craft an amazing animated christmas card in scratch in order to do that we open our browser we navigate to scratch.mit.edu and from here we click on create from the left corner and then after the page was loaded it's always a good habit to give our projects a meaningful name so i give it the name christmas card dash card and then i get rid of the things that i do not need so i delete this we are going to create the christmas card like the physical card using backdrop so i choose two backdrops i create two backdrops for the open and closed versions of the card so i go here on the backdrop and because it's a custom made backdrop which does not exist on the preexisting backdrops of the scratch i go to the paint so that i can draw my own card so i go to the paint and then i choose the color of my card because it's christmas i'm gonna create a green and red card so i click on the color and then i play with this to see the color i like now this is what i want now i click on the rectangle i draw a rectangle and then i click on the pointer to get out of that so i need one more rectangle as well i want the the other rectangle to be red so i change the color i choose a new color red red red and then i draw another rectangle which is about the same size so i draw one more now i'm gonna move this a bit here i want to make it look like that is a card that is halfway opened so i click on this reshape icon here and then i'm gonna drag the corners a bit upward and a bit upward here the same on this one then i'm gonna put this edges on each other so now i have a card that looks like looks like is halfway opened what else i'm gonna do is i duplicate this now i have two backdrops i can give them a better name so for this one i say closed card and for this one i'm gonna say opened cart so it makes more sense rather than be backdrop two or three or numbers now i see the change is applied here okay now let's play with this one and make it look like it's an opened card so i click on the reshape and then i'm gonna flip this over so that it looks like it's an opened card something like this and this one i reshape it a bit that's pretty much what i want let's add a couple of sprites as well so i go to this one and then i click on this price and i'm gonna create my own text based sprite using paint so i click on the paint and then i'm gonna write i using a color of my choice i'm gonna write here click here to open and then using this one i'm gonna draw an arrow okay and then i change the font to something that i like better i like this one because it's more like a handwriting and then i'm gonna select them all i use this one and then i uh drag it around it drag my mouse around it and then after everything is selected i choose group now everything moves together so it looks like everything is only one sprite and then i'm gonna put it on top of my card i like it better if it's white so i'm gonna change the color to something at least lighter so white so that it looks better here now we are going to write a code to operate the action of opening and closing the card first of all i want the initial state of the card to be closed so i want at the start of the project the card be on the close card backdrop so i go to the backdrops and then i click on the code and i say from the events when start clicked and then from the looks switch backdrop to closed card in this case i'm certain that at the initial state the card is always closed so if i click start i see that the card is closed now the second thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna write a code so that when i click on this arrow or this sentence the whole thing is one sprite the card is switching to the opened condition and so i go to the events and then i choose when this sprite is clicked i zoom it so that you can see so when this sprite is clicked i want to switch to backdrop which is the opened backdrop so i go to the looks and then i say switch backdrop to opened cart so i click to see what happens when i click here the ba and the card is open but also after the card opens is opened i don't want to see this one anymore so from the looks i can choose height so if i click here now the card is opened and i do not see that uh sentence anymore one more thing is one more thing that i need to write here is that when the card is closed and right away after i click the start at the very beginning i want to make sure that arrow and the sentence is showing up so right here i would go to the events and say when start clicked now i say show so i'm sure that when i click the start this one is showed up so now the card is closed on the initial state this one is shown as well now we need to add more stuff on the opened card so i click on the sprite and then i just choose one of the premade sprites but you can really do choose whatever you want um i just i search for winter and then this snowman comes up i choose this now i drag this snowman onto the card and i want it to be hidden when i'm on the closed card and i want it to be shown when i switch to the opened card backdrop so so initially when start is clicked i don't want it to be here what i can do is i can say initially when start is clicked i broadcast a message which can be done from the events broadcast message a new message is hide snowman so i drag it here so what i expect is uh is when i kick the start i broadcast hide the snowman so now i go to the snowman and then i say when i receive hide the snowman i would hide so i drag this now let's test it i click start now you see at the initial state i don't have it now i click open the snowman is not here so now i need to need it to be shown again i go to the sprite and then on top of when this sprite is clicked switch to open card again another broadcast message which is broadcast new message not this sign show snowman so i drag it here let's test and see what happens okay i set the show to snowman but i didn't add it to the stomach so i go to the snowman again when i receive the show snowman now this time show when i receive show snowman show from the looks let's click again initial state i click here the snowman shows up uh i can add something else to make it more interesting which is on after the show i can say say merry christmas for two seconds or maybe even more four seconds not testing it i click here it says merry christmas let's do one last thing which is adding a song so that when the card is opened is musical card in order to do that i go to the sounds i click here and search i go to the loops and i choose something like this one preferably you can record the christmas song or something if you're artistic but otherwise you can choose something that exists here now i go back to the code and then from the sounds i say play sound until done now let's test it again uh so you see that there is a force against the delay before the card is the song is placed so i just slapped these two so that it starts playing right away so again i click and then after a bit i will see these messages coming so we're done with this tutorial hurry up you are so close to the christmas create christmas cards for your
