hello hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling awesome welcome back to another tutorial in this tutorial we are going to create a wonderful artwork which is drawing with diamond let's dive in in order to get started we say goodbye to this cat bye and then we go here and then we are going to add an extension which is pen with this pen extension we can do lots of amazing things so let's see one example before we start i'm gonna show you a quick demo of one of the things that you can create with pen so let's click start and you see this is so wonderful would you like to see how to make this stay tuned welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun well we got rid of the cat and we have no sprites so let's go here and choose something i have chosen this crystal but you can obviously choose whatever your heart desires so let's start with this first thing first when start clicked we want something to happen which is so first of all we when i clear the screen so that you can start with this part with nothing in it so in order to go to do that i go to pen again and there is an option of erase all so as you saw in the demo what was happening was something kept being repeated so i go to control and i drag forever because i'm thinking of a repetitive behavior which is this cool feature stamp so i'm gonna forever stamp with this sprite and i'm also gonna stamp and move so like move 10 steps let's run it and see so this is so far now it's time to enhance it i want it to be colorful so i go to motion not motion sorry go to looks and i'm gonna change color effect by let's say by 5 or 10 let's see how it looks like oopsies okay let's fix the location so i want it to rotate or like i want it to follow my mouse let's go to motion and drag this point two arts mouse pointer now it looks like this pretty cool isn't it but we can keep enhancing it so in order to do that i'm gonna turn another motion turn turn turn so every time that i'm in this loop i want to turn it some amount like not 15 degree to make it even more interesting i can turn it some like random number 15 to 30 so the diamond is turning around it's also a bit small so you can also change the size to it's a hundred percent means exactly this size but i'm also gonna do that some random number more uh the more random the more random numbers we add the pattern is gonna be more exciting that's what i think so maybe 150 to 300 so some are smaller and somewhere bigger so you see how cool it is one more thing that i can do to create more applications out of that like being able for instance to write with this is i should be able to discontinue uh creating patterns let's say i want to write my name i write e and then i want to go to the next letter so i want to be able to stop it and then continue from here so what if i if i just stop it and press start everything is gonna be deleted so i need a different solution which i'm gonna show you now i go to i'm gonna write a condition i would say if from sensing if mouse is down when i left click on my mouse and hold it in that condition i would say pen up so in that situation it won't write so it's gonna help me to be able to go to the next letter so now i'm gonna write oops again i'm gonna write e and now i wanna stop it so i hold my mouse and then i put it here so i don't hold and release i keep holding it and then i write the next letter and again i'm gonna repeat it not much space for me but i could write two letters okay i hope you liked this tutorial if you did don't forget to like it and please subscribe to my channel so that i can be seen in this youtube and more people would be able to join and use this tutorials thank you so much and see you next week
