hi hi hi how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to learn how to create a touch the ball game this is ellie and this is your place where to go and have fun so let's see a demo of the game first so i click on the green flag and i have 20 live zero score so i need to gain as much score as i can by avoiding the balls and not touch the ball so that i won't lose any game let's go to the left go to the right i lost nine lines and one line and game over let's create a new project and let's name our project dodge the bowl and this time let's keep the straw let's keep this right and choose a backdrop i'm gonna choose a very simple backdrop like like what maybe just this one and then let's go to the back drops create a second one and name the second one game over for our game over screen and let's type game over with red color on it okay over just make it a little bit bigger like this over and i don't want this one anymore so blue sky and game okay and also does the ball so we need both let's search for a ball it's right here plus one or this one let's take this one so i have a ball now let's write the code so to start let's program the move of the cat to the right and to the left also let's make it a little bit smaller 50 the smaller it is is less challenging to not hit the ball to avoid the ball so like always so for the movement to the right and left there are two ways we can do it we can either say when right arrow and left arrow clicked then move several steps to the right and left like this so right now i can move to the right by right arrow but the performance is not gonna be great so instead to make it better i would say when start clicked forever if so i'm going to take the if condition which is on the control and then on the sensing if key right arrow pressed now here i say move 10 steps so these two codes do the same thing but the cat reacts faster to this one because it's forever checking this condition but this one is gonna be a bit sluggish so i'm gonna through this way and i'm gonna keep this one only let's write the same thing for the left arrow so that the cat can move to the right to the left as well so i'm gonna duplicate this and i'm putting it here and then i just change this one to and instead of 10 steps i would say minus 10 steps so i can move left and i can move wrong here uh i don't need that forever again so i can move right let's start again i can move right and i can move left oh come on it should be here so again i can move right and i can move left so make sure that you have forever and then inside you have one if and another if so we're good so far for the movement of the cat there is one issue if you look at the cat the cat is not working but it's gliding which is not what we want so to make it look like is actually working let's say let's use the costumes so switch costume to next so i would say move 10 steps and next and the same here let's give it a try now it's actually working cool so far now let's program the bulb so for the ball let's click on the ball and let's move it all the way up so when i move it all the way up my y position which showed this location so this 1 5 8 is exactly where my y is so here and here this ones are the same so initially i want the ball to start from the top and any x in this line so how would i write it is when green flag clicked what i want is on the motions i wanted to go to um y five one five nine but i don't want the x to be always minus thirty i want it to start from any random location at the top so i go to operator and i say there is one random peak random between not one to ten so somewhere between here which is minus two two three minus two two three and here which is plus 2 to 3. so i start from here and then i come down so forever i want to choose a motion change y by not 10 but 10 so that it comes down so the bigger this number uh it is like the positive of it it's gonna come faster so if it's minus 10 is like this it is let's say minus 30 it's gonna come super fast let's keep it for as minus 10 so we can increase this side if we want it if we want our gain to be even more challenging so this is this so far so now the ball is coming down but when it reaches here it doesn't do anything else so i want it to go back at the top again and come down and up and down and up and down so i write a piece of code so that when it's reached here so if my y position let's go to motions and if my y position let's take the operator as well is equal to not 50 but when i'm in this location the y is minus 187 when it's here i want it to go back to the top so exactly like when it just started so all i'm gonna do is duplicate this whole thing and then remove this part and put this one back again so when you get here go back to the top again and start the loop so that's how we do it so let's play the game a little bit i can go left and right so two things we should do is one is the counting the um counting the scores or like some criteria for finishing the game and gaining points also one more thing let's have more balls which i can do it simply by duplicating and duplicating so the more balls more challenging like this now i want to have two variables one for measuring when the cat is losing and one for gaining the scores so i'm going to variables let's start stop this i'm making one variable live lives so the number of lives that the cat has so after the cat loses all the lives the game is game over and i keep it for for all sprites and one more variable that i named it score so how does it work is lives is like we can say at the beginning the cat has 10 lives 20 lives depending on how easy or difficult you want it you decide for the number and for the scores whenever the ball reaches the floor and the cat is avoiding it we can increase the scores so these two variables usually when we have variables we need to initialize it which means set the initial value for it that likes to something and score to something so when we just started there is no score but we need to have some number of lives and we lose when or like we die or we lose when we lost when we lose all of our lives so let's say 10. now let's write a code for increasing scores when the ball reaches the floor how do i write it here i've already written a condition for reaching the y to the floor so here i can increase the score so if y position is anything like if there's this number or anything less than this number change scores by 1 by 2 by whatever you want so whatever the balls are coming down the score is going up and up and up and also whenever the cat is touching the balls the cat should lose a life so less write one more condition so make sure we are on the ball for now i'm gonna remove the extra balls so that i i duplicate it when all the codes are updated so let's write one more if condition i control if then one operator not operator let's go to the sensing and let's write if touching sprite which means if the ball touches the sprite i'm gonna lose one live which is change lives change the variable lines by minus one let's give it a try so i start by ten live zero score whenever the ball is touching the floor the score is going up and any time oh the scratch is too high i need to change that as well so anytime it touches i'm losing one life okay so all the lives are gone but i never wrote any code for finishing the game so now we have two things left two more things left we need to initialize the cat to start from here and also some way to finish the game let's see okay so let's set the initial location for the cat so that you're assured that it's in a good position maybe let's say here so i drag this code here and then let's write our game over cut so if you remember on the backdrop we had two backdrops one the simple one for the in for the game over so let's go to the code of backdrop and always i know i'm on the backdrop when i don't see the motions so let's write it like this when green flag clicked initially i want to be on the simple backdrop so let's go to the looks and switch back drop to blue sky so be here first and stay here until the lives are zero so from the controls wait until operator something equal to zero and that something is lives and then when the life became zero then we're gonna switch the backdrop to game over backdrop to the game over backdrop and then everything is gonna stop so control and stop all let's play i have 10 lines i lost most of them except two and now i'm game over let's add one little cosmetic which is a sound that we want to hear when you're game over so let's go to the sound i don't want to play sound pop so i again go to the sound i search for lose and i add this here and now in the code i can see play sound lose until done and then stop so let's test it two lines now to make our game a bit more challenging and fun let's duplicate a bit more balls and go to the right i hope
