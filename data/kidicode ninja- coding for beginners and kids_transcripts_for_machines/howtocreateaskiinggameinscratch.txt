hello and welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial we're going to see how we can create a skin game this is ellie and this is your place to learn to go and have fun let's dive in first of all let's see how the game works so i press my right and left arrow key to move the skewer to the left and right and i need to avoid the obstacles like the tree or anything that i see here and you see on the left there is a score so whenever i pass the obstacle my score goes up one level and if i hit i'm game over like okay let's see how we can make it if you would like to follow a line go ahead and create a new project from scratch.mit.edu and then give a good name to your project i'm gonna name it skin game by the way this tutorial was requested and if you two have a request on what you would like to learn go ahead and put it down the comment and i try to create that tutorial for you so i gonna delete this cat as well i'm gonna use different sprites so we need a backdrop and a skier and some obstacles so i'm gonna create them first for skier you can go and download something from the internet but i'm just gonna keep it simple so i'm downloading this one and let's make the size small enough that makes sense i'm gonna make it 40 and then i'm gonna modify it a bit so i go to costume let's see what we have here i think just this neutral position is good enough for skiing this one is also not bad but just let's give it a simple yeah i'm gonna keep this too so let's draw the ski shoes i'm taking this paint and drawing one ski and the second ski you can choose whatever color you want and then i'm filling it with this it obviously doesn't really look like ski but it's good enough for what i want to do because i'm just going to give a demo and you can take your time and draw as perfect as you would like to so i'm gonna group the whole thing together here and now i'm putting the shoes here and here you can always click here and rotate it to make it just like the dimension that's the direction that you would like to and also with this front and back you can make sure that the ski is at the back so it shouldn't cover the character you also need the poles i'm gonna go ahead and draw a line i'm gonna give it a bit of a width yeah so one pole and the other pole unless a little sharp part here something like this now let's group each of them to make it one so that it's not gonna um separate and this one in this hand and this one in the other hand let's rotate it a little bit it's obviously not perfect but for what we want is good all right and also let's click on ctrl a and group the whole thing all together now i'm to make it simpler i'm gonna delete this one now duplicating this so i have the skier a abbey right and i named the other one abby left and what i'm gonna do is i select the whole thing by ctrl a and mirror this one so that it looks like she's looking at the left so here we go we're done with the sprite now let's also create a backdrop for the backdrop i'm gonna choose just a simple blue sky and then using the line i'm gonna draw one they're gonna line here and one they're gonna line here so it resembles the ski heel kind of i just want to pretend it's a ski heel let's also put a bit of obstacles here i'm gonna choose three uh actually the obstacle should be from the sprite so i'm gonna choose tree i choose this one it's not actually a winter tree but it's more fantasy so i'm just going to choose it let's also pick one more maybe what shall we use what do we have on a ski resort like how about stone rock yeah we have rocks so i'm also gonna take some rocks okay now let's get into writing the code one more thing we need is a variable for score in order to be able to keep track of the scores i'm gonna click on variable and i'm gonna make a variable naming it gate score and it's for all the sprites okay and as a starting point i'm gonna set my variable to zero so when start clicked i'm gonna set it to zero so when we are not playing yet there is no score fair enough so make sure you change this to score and now let's say let's see what other things need to be done when we click start when i click start i want my character to be at the top of the page let's say here so not here so when i click on the character i would like to say when start clicked now that i put this character here by my mouse if i go to x into the motion the x and y location now matches the location of here so i only drag it right here also i want my character to be at the 90 degree so what do i mean by that i'm gonna tell you in a minute so i say point in direction 90. so so what do i mean by saying point in direction in order to understand if this is my character here is the direction if it's like this i'm on the zero degree and if i want it to be upright standing i should rotate 90 degrees so now my character is pointing to 90 degrees so that's what i want my starting position to be now let's control the character movements to left and right by pressing on right and left arrow keys on the keyboard so i want to say when not space but when uh right arrow clicked what i want to do is first i want the costume to be this one so i would say i go to the looks and i would say switch costume to abby wright and other than that i wanted to the direction i want it to be like this so let's say point to direction 105 motion point in direction instead of 90 105 and i also want to move a little bit to the right so change x by maybe 10 so if i play start and i press my right arrow that's what happens i want to write a similar thing for the left arrow so to make it easy i duplicate this i put it here and i change this to left switch costume to left and for the direction if let's press left so if this is my character when i'm turning right left i want it to point to something less than 90 let's say 63 or maybe 75 so point in direction 75 and also go to the left means change x y minus something like 10 or whatever let's play start i go right i go left so the skewer is moving but it doesn't look like it's going down so in order to make it look like it's going down instead i'm gonna move other items up to create the illusion that the skier is going down so this goes up and this goes up so that i feel that the skewer all is going down so unless or let's write the code for that one as well in order to move the obstacle up obstacles up what i need to do is start from any position across this line at the bottom and then glide all the way up and then disappear wait a few minutes and then go back down appear and repeat so i need a forever loop i'm gonna say forever height first and then i want to start from a random location across this line for that i'm gonna create a variable i'm gonna name it x tree exposition tree or like x position tree start so by this i mean the initial location that this tree is gonna start now i'm gonna set the value of this start position so set exposition to let's go to operator a random location between let's say here at the very end which is going to be minus let's say 200 to 200 and then i would say go so now i'm going to say from where i want to start so go to x which is this variable which we have set it already on the line before anywhere across here randomly generated and i want it to be at the very bottom not here or here at the very bottom so the y should be minus 180 all right now it's here i want it to glide all the way up so i would say glide in one second or whatever you want depending on how slow or fast you want skier to ski go to same x position which was this one exposition 3 start but i this time i want it to be all the way up because i want it to glide all the way up so 180 one thing is i need to make sure i'm showing it so i can show it here i can also change the costume so that every time that the tree is coming it looks differently and i'm going all the way up what else let's run it and see so far what we have oh i didn't put the start clicked on the top okay now let's see so yeah the three is going up and every time it's going it looks differently and so far so good i'm gonna let's also put a bit of weight after so that it looks more natural like right now is a bit super fast so let's also wait one second here all right now let's do a trick let's copy the whole thing here for the rock as well so that the rock is also gonna move let's see if it came which is correct now let's see how it works actually it didn't copy here let's try again so i'm dragging it and i'm putting it on the rack all right now it's here so start uh i don't want to see this i only need to see the score so let's uncheck this one we only have the score also it doesn't look nice that both of the tree and rock are moving at the same time so in order to fix that let's go to the rock and let's put a weight here with a random wedding amount here also let's make this one random as well so we can create a more natural appearance of those items random between one two three and also one two three let's see now okay now let's play the game so i start i go i try to avoid the obstacles and any time okay we didn't tried the code for the score yet but now i can move right and left now let's create the scores program the scores as well so what i want is any time that i'm avoiding the obstacle the character is avoiding the obstacle i want the point to be up one and whenever that is touching any of those items those obstacles i want the game to be game the player to be game over for the scores all i need to do is changing the score by one so from the variables i'm gonna just change score by one whenever i'm at the end of this movement so whenever the tree or the rock gets to the top of the scene the stage i'm gonna increase the score it means that it didn't hit the skier i'm gonna do that just do the same thing here what is this i have two okay so i'm gonna say change score by one here as well at the very end or just after it reached the top uh also let's program the game over which is when touching so for touching we can use the sensing and i'm writing the code for it i'm gonna do control we can do when start clicked rocks after that switch costume to collapsed so i want to show that it's collapsed so let's first create a costume for it i'm gonna duplicate it and create a costume collapsed for that let's make it look like the abbey fella fell down so everything scatters around the ski somewhere and this one here and she's gonna just collapse oh poor abby okay now this is a collapse so uh when touching those things i want to change the costume to the one that i created just now switch custom to collapsed and then here stop everything stop all the script which is under control stop all which you see now it's not gonna move back to the original position so let's again go to the costume and start as switch custom to here so when we start is standing and then when we are game over is collapsing so just let's deliberately get get game over yeah let's also play a sound for it to actually make it look like a game i'm gonna going to the sound and let's add something relevant for our game over i chose this one splash but i'm gonna make it a bit softer to make it look like someone is falling on the snow so i would say under sound play sound splash until done so let's play the game i'm going right left and i try to avoid the obstacles and now i lost the game and i got the game over it was such a cool game i really enjoyed playing it and developing it i really hope you too also enjoyed if you did don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you can get notification when i upload a new video and this was a requested video by one of you and if you two have some requests go ahead and put it on the comment and i try to make it as soon as i can thank you so much and see you soon bye
