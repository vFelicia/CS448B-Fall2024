hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to see how we can create a working clip like this one is showing the actual time just like a real stick around we're gonna see how we can make this welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun all right let's see what do we need to make this we need three things a backdrop for this yellow part and then we need a sprite for this little lines and then another sprite for the handles that show the second hour and the minute let's see how i encourage you to follow along with me so log into your account and then click on this create after the project was loaded delete the cat go to the backdrop and search for something that looks similar to the clock i'm like the clock face so i'm gonna take this light for my backdrop and then from the sides for the degree for those little lines like this lines i'm gonna take the button sprite and then for the handles i need one sprite with three costumes so i go for search i can draw it in paint but it's much faster if i can find something similar to a clock handle which here we go this line so let's adjust the size i'm gonna make this much smaller because this is this little things here and then this is gonna be used for a second so going let's make this size like 20. it does need to be still much smaller so i go to the costume and then i drag it from here so that it can be used for the second duplicate it one more time make it a little smaller and a little wider to show than minutes let's also change the color to make it let's say gray so this is gonna be for a minute you can play with the and then so this is minute let's change the name here also to minute and second let's duplicate this again make it a little bit shorter again so that it's gonna be shorter and wider to show the handle for the hour a little bit shorter okay here we go now i'm gonna show you something really cool in order to do that in order to draw the clock completely first thing you need to do is go to here and add the pen extension so that you can access these codes and then also make sure to be on the button sprite so for this lines i'm gonna name this just i'm gonna name it degrees to refer to those little lines on the clock and then let's say when start clicked go to the center of the screen and then i'm gonna erase everything so from the pen there is a code erase all after we got a clear screen after erasing everything i'm gonna write a code to create this blue lines that are that are showing the hours so like here is 12 o'clock one o'clock two three so this is what i'm gonna draw on my clock i'm gonna use stamp so i have this sprite i'm gonna rotate and the stamp rotate and snap rotate and stamp rotate and stamp so since we have 12 hours on the clock i'm going to repeat 12 times rotate stamp rotate the stamp rotate stamp and then in order to know how many degrees i need to rotate from here to here i should divide 360 by 12 which is going to be 30 every rotation degrees so let's write the code since we said we have 12 hours i'm going to control repeat 12 times and then turn so from the motions so i'm writing a code for this blue thing so turn from motion 30 degrees because 360 divided by 12 30 degrees so remember this thing is right now in the center so it's turning 30 degrees only like this and then now it needs to move all the way to the end of the clock so i say move or yeah move move move maybe 100 steps and now stamp so the same pattern is going to be stamped here and now i want it to go back to where it was so it's putting the stamp of itself and then it's going back now move again minus 100 steps so this action is gonna be repeated 12 times so i expect to see 12 blue lines around this to refer to ours let's run it like this super cool now i want it to go a bit closer to the edge so instead of 100 maybe 120 and 120 here as well let's run it again it looks much better pretty cool isn't it so one little problem is that this orange ones are covering the blue ones so i'm going to the costume and making this blue ones a little bigger make sure to click on this arrow and drag it to make it longer than the other one as long as it fits let's try again it's better now something really important that you can do when you program is like when you see that this code is going to be very long use blocks so i'm going to create a block from my black makeup like and then i'm gonna name it draw like i'm also gonna check run without screen refresh so okay with this block i'm defining drawing the clock so all i need to do is drag draw a clock so this little code is much easier to read and also i can always drag this to my backpack and be able to reuse it in other programs and always just call draw clock okay so this part so far was drawing the clock but we also now need to show the actual time so that our plug is functional let's see how for showing the time using this clock handles i'm gonna use the clone if you're not familiar with the clone i have another video that i will put on the description so that you can go there and play with clones a little bit and then come back here but what i have to do here is for each handle for the minute hour and second i'm gonna create a clone since i'm gonna repeat something create clone for three things three customs and this let's let's change the name of this one to handle or like clock handle when a start clicked repeat three times before repeating i'm gonna hide those handles first and then repeat three times go to next costume so for each costume including second minute and hour we create a clone so just create a clone of my self now we are gonna use those clones to show the time let's say we're gonna use the let's start with showing the second so when i start as a clone now we need to show the clone previously it was hidden so let's go to looks show and also let's make sure that it's going to the center of the clock so go to the center and some rotation pointing to the specific time should happen forever because it's a clock right is gonna work forever so control forever now this handle the clone of this handle that is now being shown from hiran it needs to point to a certain number or a certain second certain line referring to number around the clock so i would say point to ours a direction point in direction which direction i want it to point to that direction should be current second so from sensing you can take current second but how many because this thing is the degree it should rotate so for every second on the clock for every orange line we have 6 degrees because remember here we turn 60 degrees and then we stamp one orange line which represents a second so i would say current second multiply six second multiply 6 the degree of rotation for pointing to the second let's see how it works now if i click start it's pretty much turning like it's showing the second but something is wrong which is other degree other handles are also rotating which is not what we want so we need to differentiate them using an if condition so let's go to if i want to say do this only if the costume is the one which is for the second so let's go to operator and take this we're gonna compare something and then from looks i would say if you go to the bottom of the looks there is something custom number change it to custom name and put it here if custom name is second only at that time do this so now you see that it's showing the clock i want to drag this handle to here okay i should go to custom and i should go here and make sure it's here so if you look at this thing i'm gonna zoom it i need to put on here to now is correct so let's do this for the other costumes as well let's put this one here and then here on this dot on the center okay the last step is we are gonna write two more ifs for a second and for a minute i recommend you to stop the video and try by yourself first make it easier i'm going to duplicate this one and put it here and duplicate one more time and put it here and then i'm gonna modify it so when custom name is minute and when custom name is our so for a minute i'm gonna point in direction current minute multiply 6 also because the same orange lines are also referring to minutes as well but for hours we only have 12 numbers so 360 degrees the whole circle divided by 12 numbers of the hours on the clock the blue ones is going to be 30 degrees rotation so between this blue line and the other one is 30 degrees rotation so point in direction so if the custom name is our current hour multiply 30. so if i start is showing 11 57 which is the same as the clock on my computer if you look here you see these are the same thing it was such an interesting project with a lot of learning inside it i hope you liked this video if you did please don't forget to like subscribe and share it with your friends
