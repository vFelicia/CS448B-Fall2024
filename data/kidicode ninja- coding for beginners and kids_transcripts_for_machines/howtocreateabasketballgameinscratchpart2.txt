hello hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling awesome in this tutorial which is the part two of our basketball game we're gonna complete the basketball game by adding a hoop and counting the scores stick around welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun so i'm clicking on this folder so that i can go to my stuff and then i can find my previous project which was this one cyclics inside so so far we have a player ai the basketball game and if i press start and then i press the space bar again through a ball and then the ai is throwing it back to me and by up and down as well as right and left i can move the cat but we are missing the main part of the basketball game which is we need to be able to through the ball into the hoop and we need to be able to count the score so that's what we are gonna do today so i need a hoop on my backdrop i already see a hoop but i'm not gonna use this because it's static so it's not much fun instead i'm gonna create a new sprite i actually i'm going to draw it by myself so i go to the paint and then just let's take this one and then i want the fill to be white and the outline to be black so i'm drawing this hoop and then i will target to shoot the ball inside this hoop and it should be a bit smaller a little bit more something about this size so that it won't be super challenging i can also to make it more like an actual hoop i can and one white line is left i'm gonna delete it okay i want the black fell a little better anyway it's just a demo you can take your time and draw properly one thing that is important is let's first make this don't feel so that is transparent by clicking here and also how do i wanna target inside this basket to make that possible so i'm gonna take one specific color that i don't have it in this backdrop so let's say i don't have any green here or yellow here so i'm gonna take a color from here and then i'm just putting a small let's take a sip i'm putting a small circle with this green color right here in the middle just it can be as tiny as you want okay here we go and the outline now outline so if i zoom you see i put this little circle a little green thing so that i choose it for my target and then let's press ctrl a and group them all together and i can play with the sides a little alright so i have this basket now i'm temporarily removing the stage backdrop so that you can see easier but it can actually stay so i'm just changing it for now to plain one into a plain backdrop so that it's just easier for the demo but you can layer a stitch all right so the code for the hoop oh one more thing i also need a variable named score so that i can count the scores that i'm gaining okay i have the score as well now let's write a code for this hoop so that it glides around the screen in this area and then so that the cat can follow it so what i'm gonna write is when start clicked i want some constant movement of the basket the hoop so i would say forever glide in a few seconds five sets second let's say uh i meant to take this one glide five seconds to some random egg some random y so i'm going to operator and pick a random x pick a random y but i want to make sure that the y is nothing below this line because it's it's a hoop right so it shouldn't be too low so let's say from 20 to 200 and for the x it can be anywhere along this line so let's say minus 20 to 200 let's see what happens so yeah you see the hoop is just moving around randomly and now i should try jumping and throwing the ball and of course every time that i can hit the basket i'm supposed to gain score okay now let's write the code for gaining the score currently it shows the score 14 that's not what we want we want the initial at the start of the game we want the score to be zero so what i can do is i can first say when start clicked set score to zero so that's how we start the game at this point here we had a code for throwing the ball by pressing the space the ball is reaching the player and then it's diagonally going up rotates and moves up so what i want is whenever i'm throwing the ball if this spot touch the screen dot then i can gain a score so let's reset the score to zero so how can i say when i'm touching that green dots i gain score what i can do is here i repeat so the ball goes up and then i just want to detect this dot so i would say if on the sensing touching color so i click here and then i click on the color picker and put it here if touching the color green now change the score by one but then since we are in the loop i don't want the score to keep going up until it's hitting the ground so i'm gonna put a weight here so that the score goes only one up at each time that i'm hitting the green dot inside the basket or basically when i'm throwing the ball in the basket so let's just take a weight and control and wait let's say six seconds so here we go now i can through the ball and if i manage to hit the green that i can gain a score but currently you see the ball is coming very slowly towards me so what i'm gonna do is going to ai in or in the ai is waiting one second to throwing the ball i can remove this one second also on the ball here it takes three seconds for the aoi to glide the bolt to the player i'm gonna change this to one second as well so that is faster now it's much smoother so it's a little too fast now so let's put the weight here back again so here is the key oops i got one scar yay okay so this is how we count and how we play if i want it to be easier i can change this to to a higher number so that this glass is slower the the hoof is not moving super fast so it's easier for me to play but here is basically the style and any time that i press start i'm losing all my scores so make sure not to replay the start until you are finished so yeah here it is and now we can put back the backdrop the basketball i hope you
