let's freeze stay frozen let's freeze stay frozen hello and welcome to kitty code ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun are you ready open guess what you can create your own dance party with scratch do you like to join in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create a dance freeze game and from the photos of yourself while dancing i'm gonna tell you everything step by step step one find your favorite music and play step two find a plain wall or install a green background and start dancing in front of it step three ask somebody to capture a few shots of you while you are dancing step four remove the background from the images that you have using photoshop or any photo editing tool step 5. now it's time to write the code let's see how we're going to delete the background from image in order to do that you have various solutions if you have photoshop you can use that of course but if you don't have it it's not a problem just go to the google and search for free image background remover this one www.remove.pg works at the time that i'm recording the video but generally that's the process when you want to solve an issue you just google and then find a link and try and see which one works it's just all about experimenting so i click here and then here i see it says upload image i'm gonna upload an image of myself like this one and then i click remove background even without me clicking it it did remove it but if it didn't happen for you just click remove background and then you can download your photo so you just choose a good name for it whatever you like you see this png png images are the type of images that the image and the background are separated so like you have an empty background so it's easier for using it at sprites so i save it here cool here we go i have an image sprite of myself with the background removed from it i can use it in my scratch as an sprite now we are in the scratch environment uh we're gonna delete this cat because we you're not going to use it instead we're going to use our own sprite i delete this by clicking on this recycle bin icon and then i click here then i say upload this right because i want to upload something from my own computer so i say upload then i pick one of those images one of the surprise and here we go is here i can give it a reasonable name like dancer so this is my spread in order to make it dance i need to have several costumes in which each costume is going to be one of the dance poses that i captured while i was dancing so i click here to choose a costume then i try to upload multiple costumes here this one this one this one the more dance means more dance poses okay now i i have this sprite with all the costumes in it oops what did i do okay in case you didn't want to remove the background using any software you can upload your sprite here and then using this eraser deletes the area around your image but it's a little inconvenient so let's go to writing the code now all right now we're getting to the fun part we are going to actually write the code a code that makes this character which is one of ourselves dance simulating the dance is actually super easy all it needs is switching from one costume to another in a forever loop so let's go to the code which i'm here and then from the control i want to do something forever which is switching from one costume to another costume and then i go to the looks and i say next costume so forever next to forever go to the next costume and then i need some condition to trigger it so i want to say when start plate did this so again from the event when flag clicks forever go to the next costume let's see how it looks uh it's a super fast dance but it's dancing so it's a good start in order to make the dance smoother uh we can put a weight here so that it's not dancing super fast we don't want to become dizzy let's find the weight it should be in the control wait one second might be really long wait between dance poses i put like 0.3 let's see how it looks now it's nice i like it all right now stopped all right now let's add a music for our on our dance stage let's go to the sounds and then from here you can either upload something from your own computer or you can just search something from whatever is already in the scratch library i choose this option i search for dance to narrow down to some options which are more dance related i play and just test and see which one i like more which i like this one so i choose it i currently have something here um i can add as many sounds as i want here but then in the code which is which one we want it to be played all right let's go to the code if i play start here i don't hear the music yet what i need to do is from the code tell the computer to play the sound so it should be probably under the sun category i go to the sound and then here we have start sound play sound star sound might work so let's drag it here uh i can put it on the top i can also put it inside if i put it on the top it won't sink forever it would go on until it's finished for a reason that i will tell you later i put it on the top so let's see how it looks okay looks fun i like it cool cool okay now we need to freeze the character but how let's do it this way uh we want to say we want to trigger freezing by pressing the spacebar so whenever i press the spacebar i want the action of freezing happen i also want all the music to be stopped and then instead i want someone or a music or something announces freeze and i want the sprite to stop moving or changing custom so let's see so i said i want an if condition i want to say if spacebar press so i drag the if condition after all these things i go to the sensing to field this condition i see here i have the option of key space pressed so if q space pressed i want to stop all the sun all the sounds stop all sounds and at the same time i want the character not to move for let's say three seconds so i say wait three seconds so stop all sounds wait three seconds let's see how it looks like so far i press space so it's waiting all the signs are stopped and it's waiting for three seconds after three seconds is moving again but you see it's moving but the sound didn't go back again because i never said now you can stop you can start playing the sound again so i need to do that but also i don't want only the music to stop and the character to sub i also want to announce freeze i want to announce freeze in two ways one from the looks i wanna say freeze so i say freeze so this phrase shows up it would be really cool if we can record our voice and say freeze also so i go to the sounds library and then i press the microphone and record my own voice so i say press record now freeze when i was happy with my recording i can save it otherwise i can rerecord until i get my desired recording so i save it and i give it a name i name it freeze and then from my code i go to the sounds and then start sound freeze so say freeze and start sound freeze and wait three seconds so that the character is not moving one more thing is you want the music to go back playing after this three seconds is over so again i say start sound this one dance around this time okay so let's see how it goes now i play stop space bar maybe three seconds is a little too low short i say six seconds again space bar now free one more thing we can do is let's add a backdrop to make it more fun so i go here to choose a backdrop something maybe a concert background now it's more fun cool all right now let's fix a little part that we have when i click spacebar this phrase does not go even after the time of the freeze is over so now the character is dancing but the freezes are still there in order to fix it what i can do is here instead of say freeze i go and say say freeze for two seconds so i'm gonna delete this and then i drag this one instead so that after two seconds that freeze is going and it's not showing up when the character the sprite is not frozen anymore so two seconds is gone and now when it's moving it's not here anymore so that's what we want yeah we're pretty much done with this dance freeze game we can do more things here we can add more characters more surprise so that it looks like a real party this is the final code so far i'm going to put the link on the on the description the link to the project on the sprite website so that you can go there and check it out well done everyone in this lesson you learn to create your very own dance freeze game do you like to create your own dance freeze party with all your friends in it ask them to create their sprite and send to you and come back next week and we will see how we can create a really big dance party with everyone in it everyone is invited we will see how we can take turns while dancing and how we can move around the stage if you like the video give it a thumbs up
