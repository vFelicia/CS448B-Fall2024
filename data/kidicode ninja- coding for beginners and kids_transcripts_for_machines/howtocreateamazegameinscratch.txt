hello hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to see how we can create a maze game in scratch let's dive in this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun okay let's create a new project first and guess what's gonna be the name obviously we're gonna name it maze so mace and guess what we need we need a maze as a backdrop first and since the maze is not among the default scratch backdrops i'm going to a maze generator i search for maze generator and the first thing i see this mazegenerator.net is a good place to grab a maze backdrop so i'm going to change the width and height to 10 by 10 so that it's not going to be too narrow and then i click on generate here the default is pdf so make sure to change it to png and then just download it to your computer and when it was ready 10 by 10 days all i need to do is go to the backdrop and upload it here so 10 by 10 maze so now we see this beautiful maze is here which is a bit small but i can click on this backdrop tab and then choose this the whole thing and drag it to make sure it's covering the most of the screen so i zoom here and then i drag now this is a good size okay and then this cat is a little too big for the maze so it should fit within these like corridors kind of so let's make it 10 or maybe a bit bigger 20 seems like a very good size so i also need a goal or like a destination so i'm gonna choose one more sprite let's take what shall we take let's take this gift okay and then i put the gift up at the destination so the cat starts from here and the goal is to get to here and this one is also too big and now it's a good size it can be a bit bigger okay here we go now let's get the fun started we're going to write the code the code is very easy we need to write a code for the cat to move left and right up and down without touching the rolls and when we get to this point we need to say we won or the game is finished or whatever you like and okay let's see how so like always first thing first when a green flag clicked uh we need to check the keyboard presses so constantly so i go to control and i'm gonna check something forever before that what i'm gonna do is let's make sure the cat starts here so i just put the mouse the cat here and from motion i'm going to drag the cat to so go to x y of wherever it's currently is so you see these two numbers are matching already and i also want to make sure that the cat is visible so it's not hidden under any other thing so as a good practice it's good to write show obviously in this scenario it's not going to be hidden because i only have a backdrop and then this is up there but let's just write it and now let's write the movements so i'm gonna say i'm gonna write a code for when you are moving towards the right which means when we are moving towards the right which i can write it by pressing the right arrow click so if from the sensing i'm gonna say key right arrow clicked if clicked then i want to move the cat to the right so i go to motions and i write change x by let's say ten four five two whatever i would say maybe five and since i wanna make it look like the cat is moving rather than gliding since the cat has two castles like this by changing from one costume to another costume i can make it look like it's moving so i would say next costume so if i press right i can move right and the cat looks like is working but obviously the cat should not be able to pass through these lines because they are supposed to be walls right so let's write a code here again another if condition if i'm going to make this 10 to move a bit faster okay now if from sensing since these walls are black i'm going to use color if touching color i click here and then i use this color picker i put it here so that i can choose the color i want now i see if touching color black what i want to do is revert the movements of the cat so if the cat has moved 10 steps forward and then hitting the wall i wanted to say go back to where you were already so i would say if it went 10 steps forward i wanted to say go 10 steps backwards so it looks like it's not cannot pass through the walls so go here and change x by 10 so let's give it a test so here is a wall i can't go but if it was here i could google until i get i touch the wall now the same code so just exactly the same this part with a little change can be repeated for left right up down so let's duplicate it once and then here the only difference is for key left arrow i will change 10 and the for canceling gets positive 10. okay let's do the same thing for up and down so it's going to be the same thing but here instead of keywrite key up instead of key left key down and instead of change x we will say change y so let's duplicate this and then let's put it aside for now and let's keep only one because we need to change y as well so i'm instead of this one i need to change y so i'm going to drag the code from motion change y by 10 so this one we don't need it change y another change y also instead of this okay and minus 10 so i would say if key up arrow clicked change y by 10 if touching the walls cancel it revert it and go back down again so similar to this one i wanted to i want to have a code for downward movement so i duplicate this and i say if down arrow clicked change y by minus 10 and if you needed to revert it if touching the color black color or walls change y by 10. now all i need to do is put them back inside the forever loop and this one as well and this one go down down okay now let's test and see what we have done so far so start it doesn't go up for what reason if q down if key up because it's not in there forever so i'm just putting it in the correct place again okay so make sure to when you are organizing your code every if is exactly under if under forever so currently mine is not so i'm going to fix it right inside there forever now let's see so the cat can go up left up up up up it moves very nice and smooth and it's working properly yay and now okay now i can get to the gift so it means that i could win but how am i gonna tell my player that i want so let's write a code for that part as well i go to the gift and i write when start clicked so that i'm sure that it's not under the backdrop and my cat can actually touch it then i go back to sprite i could as well do it on the gift but i write it here so that i can show everything at one place all right when start clicked forever if touching the gift so sensing and now touching i will change this to gift if touching gift then i need to somehow announce that i'm game over one simple way is just to go here on the looks and say not hello but like you want yay something like this and maybe i can also play a nice winning sound so i go to sounds and search for win let's upload it and then from the code sounds and play sound when until done now let's test it i'm gonna cheat a little bit so that i can show it faster using my mouse so i go up and then i touch and it says you won't i hope you like this video if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the
