hello and welcome to another kitty code ninja tutorial in this tutorial we're going to create an abstract art in scratch i'm going to show you a demo you can create an artistic work like this in just a few minutes stick around welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun i'm gonna call it abstract part okay goodbye sprite and then i need three dots that i'm gonna draw it so what i do is i take this and i'm gonna zoom and i'm drawing a little circle here i can see here we go and then let's go to the code i'm gonna name it dots one what i wanted to do is to move around the scene so the way i write this code is when start clicked i would say move 10 step and i'm gonna put it in a forever loop because i want repeat 30 actions repetitive movements so when start clicked i want it to move 10 step before move it should look at some direction so i say point in direction uh not 90 but i'm gonna take a random number so that every time it goes to a different points to different direction and moves to a different direction okay move ten steps forever and i want it to bounce back when it's hitting the ball so currently when it goes to the wall it doesn't bounce back so let's go to motion again and bounce back uh if on edge bounce so something like this would be created and then i want three or some more of this like three four so i'm gonna duplicate it two more times so i get an effect like this for now but then if you remember the demo that i showed there were some lines being drawn in between so in order to make that i'm gonna get one more duplicate but this time i don't want this code so i'm getting this so other other dots have the code in it but this one for the last one i'm gonna write a different code then i'm gonna name this one a drawing or just let's name it a pen so i'm going to lose this let's i'm going to name this pen and in order to distinguish it i'm going back to the paint i'm going back to the pen costume and i want to change the color to something different here so that i can differentiate this one from the other two that have a different purpose now my goal is i want my pen to go to dot one and then draw a line from dot one to dot two and then draw a line from dot two to dot three and repeat it for so many times so the way i do it is first i need to bring in the pen extension so that i get this beautiful useful codes and blocks of codes so let's write the code for this again when start clicked so i said firstly i want it to go to dot one assuming this one is this one is actually dot one so i wanted to go to dot one so i would say go to that one and then i want to put down the pen there is a code here which is hand down now now i wanna so now i'm here and then pen is down so if i go here i'm drawing a line so now i go to dot 2. so go to dot 2 and go to that theory let's see what you're doing okay now i draw drew only two lines but i want more lines and also when i'm done i want the pen up so i'm gonna say pen up as well and now i need a forever loop or i can do forever or i can do maybe repeat many times like let's say 300 times start and you see very easily this beautiful pattern is made i hope you liked this video if you did please press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you will see when i upload a new video
