hello welcome back to kirikou ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial we're going to create a pawn game in scratch let's dive in okay before doing anything let's see a demo of the game first so this is what we are going to develop we have this ball on the stage that is supposed to bounce around and by this green thing i'm controlling this i'm preventing this ball from falling down this green thing moves horizontally by moving my mouse so when i move my mouse left it moves left and when i move my mouse right it moves right and when the ball hits the the red line i'm game over so if i play start i move this green thing so that the ball doesn't come down and then if i let it fall i'm gonna be game over so now i don't move it until it falls down and hits the red line so that i can show you can see how we can be game over we're kind of lucky here that it doesn't fall down so i move it a bit here yes now this game is finished so let's see how we can program this now time to write the code let's again go to scratch.mit.edu like always and then we click on the create button here now i can create a new game or new whatever animation anything from here our goal today is creating a pawn game so when the page opened i delete this cat first let's put a backdrop i click here and i choose some backdrop we can choose maybe this one and then we need to choose a ball so i search for ball we can take any ball that we like i choose this one and then let's first write let's first bounce this ball around so the first sprite that we are programming is balancing the ball how we can do that uh we start everything usually with when start clicked so i drag this block of code when it start clicked i turn the ball to some direction and from there i ask it to move around and also i need to tell the ball what to do when is touching the edges so first thing from the motions i turn the ball turn some degrees maybe 15 degrees or you can change it to anything you like after turning the ball something needs to be repeatedly done which so since i'm saying repeatedly i use this forever from the control so forever so it turns to some direction it needs to move so from the motions i say move the default is 10 step i can make it maybe 15 16 or whatever the more the faster so it moves to some direction and then something needs to happen when it touches the edge if i look here there is a code for if on edge bound so if it hits the edge it would bounce so let's play and see what happens really cool it moves around when it touches the edges it bounces so let's stop and go to the next step now let's write the second step which is moving the paddle so we need a paddle first let's go here and choose a paddle sprite so i search for paddle which is this green thing now i need to write i drag it down i need to write a code so that when my mouth is moving to the right and left this palette is also following it or like moving to the right and left whatever what a code could be first when start clicked so when start clicked i need something to happen forever so i choose the forever block i drag the forever block and then in order to follow the mouse on the horizontal direction there is something here set x 2 so i drag set x 2 from here and then instead of this number i go to the sensing we have this mouse x so whatever is the position of the mouse this paddle would take the same position so here we can see the mouse position so this paddle would follow the mouse my mouse pointer position that we can see it here so if i click start you see this x is changing over there and my paddle is following my mouse okay we're done with this step as well so i'm gonna stop it and then we can see the next step the next step is i want the ball to bounce off the paddle whenever it's hitting the pedal so how to ride this i'm gonna write a program for the ball so i click on the basketball sprite or whatever bulb that you have and then again i say when start clicked like before i need something to be happening regularly so i'm taking forever and dragging forever what i want to happen is i'm thinking about a condition i want the ball to bounce if only if is touching the paddle so i need an if i go to the control and then i drag the if block so as i said my condition was touching paddles so on the sensing i can find touch touching paddle i drag it here and i put it inside that if so if touching pedal then i want it to bounce so in order to balance it needs to turn a little bit and then move so from the motion i take turn for the turn let's choose a number between maybe 150 to 180 so from the operator i say turn and then i take a random number so again i show it here from the operator pick random number instead of 15 between 100 50 70 to 190 the reason is i wanted to bounce back so the direction should be almost opposite what it was so almost 170 to 90 so like mirroring it and then bouncing it so first turn and then move and then i take move this time i can choose maybe 10 if i wanted to go slower than this one or i can do whatever i want and then i also want to have some weight in between moves to make the movements look a bit more natural so from control i take wait a tiny bit maybe half a second let's see how it works i play and then i move my mouse so that when the ball is this green paddle it bounces up really cool isn't it i love it okay stop now the last step is we want to add a red line so that when the ball is the red line the game is over let's see how to write it to program the game over we need a red line so from the sprites i choose i search for line so we have the line here now i need to program the line again when start clicked from the event so when start clicked so first thing is after start i want this red line to drop down to the lowest position so how to write this i can write it like go to x 0 y minus 170 so it will drop to the very bottom of the stage and then again game over thing is something that happens forever so forever something is to be checked which is whenever the ball hits the red line then we're game over so i need a forever which is in the control so forever and then i need a condition so i go to the if i drag an if then from control and my condition is if touching the ball so from the sensing i drag touching basketball so if my red line is touching the basketball then i need everything to be stopped so that i'm game over so from the control again i have stop all which is here so i drag it and then let's play the game i click start right away i was game over so i put it up again i drag it up up again so i click start and then oops i gained over so quickly so i need to be really quick not to let the ball to hit the red so again i click i put it up i click okay yeah so with the paddle i can push up the ball but then if i not quick enough so that it's hitting the red line i'm game over so we're done with writing this code this was an easy and very interesting game i'm gonna put the link to the code in the scratch website in the comments below so that you can go and check it out and see it more clearly uh feel free to share your feedback comments and any questions if you have in the comments below i'm happy to go and answer your questions if you liked the video don't forget to like
