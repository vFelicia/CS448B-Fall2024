hello and welcome to kirikou ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun like always we go to scratch.edu.mit we are going to create snowfall effect we can add it to our previous session christmas card and christmas light that we created in the last two videos i put a link at the end so that you can go and check them out but now we're going to see how we can create snowfall so we go to scratch dot we create we click on the create on the top left corner we wait for the page to load and then after the page was loaded we have two blocks of codes one for creating the snow and the other part for falling down the snow so let's give our project a proper name so i give it the name snow fall i delete the cat and then i want to choose a backdrop which is winter and i also need snow sprite so from the sprites i choose snow flakes i make it a bit smaller size 20. i'm also gonna change my backdrop color so that the snow flake is visible on it so i click on the backdrops tab and then from the fill i drag this to the left to make it darker now you can see the snow more clearly go back to the code but also i should click on the sprite because i'm going to write the code for sprite so starting with with when start clicked what i want to happen is first i want to make sure this is shown so i drag show and then the plan is we want this note to go from invisible to visible so it looks like it suddenly appears on the screen so i would go to the lyrics and say set ghost effect assign that change set ghost effect to so i changed the color to ghost to 100 so it becomes completely transparent so like if i click the start you see that the snow is not visible but it's there but it's just the ghost effect is 100 and then i want to clone the snow at the top of my screen on random positions so i would say forever from the controller drag forever go to random position i'm temporarily changing this to 20 so that you can see what's going on so first forever go to a random position which from the motion go to random position and then i want to make sure that my snow is always at the top of the screen so i would say go to set y to 180 so i click on the start so you see i'm moving the snow at the very top so the y is always 180 but the x is changing to random locations at the same time i don't want to only move it i also want to clone it so i would say must be under control create clone of myself so now this snow is cloned in random horizontal locations but always at the very top where the y is 180 so see that's what is happening other than this i want two more things i want the snow to come down down down and also move a bit left and right so i'm gonna drag this away now i want to do something with this clone which is coming down and moving around with these clones so i would say when i start as a clone so this is something that is happening to every clone on the screen when i start as a clone first of all i gave the ghost effect at 100 to make it transparent now i want it to be shown so i would say remove the or clear the graphic effects nice cleared now let's write the program the movement so i say forever forever first writing the horizontal movements of the snow so like a bit left and right i would for this i would say change x spy instead of this one from the operators pick a random i drag pick random between minus one to plus one so the wider this range is the snowflakes are moving more like left and right the wider range i can later play with it so that you will see so this is what is happening till and then we also want it to come down as well so i would say change let's say minus four uh the bigger if i exclude the minus the bigger this number is the faster the snow comes down so if it's minus 10 the snow is coming really fast but if it's minus 2 is coming really slow so change y by minus 4 and i want the clone to be deleted when it's reached the bottom of the screen so i would say if from the controls um if why actually from the operators this one i tried this one if y is less than 175 almost close to the bottom bottom in that case i want the clone i want the clone to be deleted so on the control we have delete this clone so when it reaches here it needs to be deleted so let's run it beautiful snowfall what you can do with this is you can combine this with the previous video christmas card or christmas light or three of them together and create a very interesting christmas card and send it to someone that you care about them don't forget to share your projects on the comment i would love to see them if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss another tutorial see you next week
