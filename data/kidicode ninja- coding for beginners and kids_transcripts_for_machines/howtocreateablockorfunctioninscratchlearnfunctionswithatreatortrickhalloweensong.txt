hello hello hello you love these scratchers how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful i have something very exciting for you in this tutorial we are going to learn about functions with a trick or treat song let's go trick or treating let's start writing let's listen to a song and see why it's so easy to remember this song and how we can help our computer to learn it as easy as us this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun like traitor trick who are you i'm a ghost i'm a little ghost knight trick to are you i'm a ghost i'm a little ghost knight chittor chick who are you i'm a monster i'm a little monster night night trader treat blue are you i'm a monster i'm a little monster i like trick or treat who are you i'm a witch i'm a little witch knickknack trickortreat who are you i'm a witch i'm a little i'm a cowboy i'm a little cowboy nike who are you i'm a cowboy i'm a little cowboy a little who are you i'm a pirate i'm a little pirate knight like trickortreat who are you i'm a pirate i'm a little pirate the reason learning this song was so easy was because a lot of the parts were just repeating themselves so look at this and this see the highlighted part so the first one i'm a ghost i'm a cowboy this only the word ghost cowboy the witch the monster the ballerina the pirate are the parts that are being changed but the rest of the song repeats itself in all different parts of the song so how can i write it in the computer language much simpler than repeating it there is something called functions or in scratch it's block that helps us write the things that have a repetitive patterns and we instead of repeating ourself we write it once and then we can reuse it now let's go here i rewrote this song and then i took off the costumes like the ghost the pirate the ballerina and instead i named it a hollow incasto now with this only one paragraph and changing this to a parameter named halloween costume i'm creating this sign but instead of repeating it multiple times i'm only changing this part to a parameter let's see one example of writing such a thing in scratch now let's see how we can use functions or blocks in scratch first of all let's import a few costumes in our song we had ballerina we had ghost for the purpose of demo i only show two but of course you can add as much as you want after you see how easy it's going to be with using blocks now let's go to blocks here on the left i click on my blogs and now i'm gonna create a new blog that can generate that song i'm gonna name it it's always a good idea to name our functions or blogs as if it's a verb like you're saying do something now i'm gonna say sing treat or treat song and i also wanted to have an input remember we had something being changed in our song which was that costume once was i'm a little ghost and then i'm a little pirate i'm a little ballerina so here my input is gonna be kids costume and i say okay now this function can be defined under this like i'm going to define a very simple function so just that i'm showing the idea of using functions let's say the function is supposed to write the lyrics of that song i'm gonna grab a couple of says like this night night trick or treat so this is the part that is fixed who are you and then here we have i mil little now this part is something that is going to be changed so this is the important part the part that is a parameter and it's being changed all i have to do is let me zoom it all i have to do is to drag this part here so what happens is whenever here i'm defining a function whenever i'm calling the function i can pass a value to this parameter sounds complex but don't worry in a minute you will see how easy it is now let's say if i click here when it gets to the kids costume i'm a little it's a zero because it doesn't yet know what it is so now i need to call the function and pass the parameter to call the function is very easy i'm gonna say have an event to trigger it when this sprite clicked now i say sing trick or treat song now for the ballerina with the kids costume of ballerina now let's see what happened i'm gonna click here knock knock knock trick or treat i'm a little ballerina now very easily i can use this for the ghost or for as many function many costumes or like a spice carrot kids costume or sprite here in scratch that we have and we can create a very interesting animation only because of using function very easily now i copy this here and i copied this here as well and then when i go to the ghost let me copy this again to make sure i got it okay now that i'm on the ghost all i need to do is the function is already defined i'm calling the function and now i'm passing the parameter ghost so here if i click this i'm not connected i'm a little ghost that's it with this our life is going to be much much easier you see all the blocks that you have are the functions that are already created by scratch but here you can create your own your own customized functions and make your life much easier happy halloween if you liked the video don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss
