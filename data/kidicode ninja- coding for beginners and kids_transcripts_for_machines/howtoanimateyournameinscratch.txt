hello everyone in this tutorial we are going to see how we can animate our name in scratch this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun are you ready open let's dive in like always we go to scratch.edu.mit and then we click on the create so that we can create a new project and then i give it a name a proper name that indicates what i'm gonna do so i can say animate name or you can choose whatever you like let it load okay so i name it animate name i delete the cat since i'm gonna animate a name i need sprites that are in form of letters so i can import all the letters of my name and use them as a sprite so i click here and i go to the letters section so that i only see the letters all things letter so my name is ellie so i choose a and then i click again then another l one more l i have an eye you can import the letters of your own name or whatever sentence or anything you are interested to write there and animate so i arranged them in proper order so that is clear what i have here on the stage and now our sprites are ready so we're going to see what sort of animation we can do we can create with this sprites here let's start with a very simple animation let's say i want the color of the letters to be changed when i click on them so how to write this i click on this right i choose it and then i start writing the code first i need an event to trigger any action so i go to the events and i say when this sprite clicked because i want the animation to start when i'm clicking on the sprite and i want to change the color so since i'm saying color the next code should be on the looks i go to the looks and then i choose change color effect by default is 25 but you can change it to any other number so let's try and see what happens i click here oops this one was the e that i was using so i click here and then the color keeps changing isn't it cool i love it let's create another animation for the l what i want to happen is whenever i click on this i want it to spin so i want it to change direction slowly slowly so i say again when sprite clicked so when the sprite clicked what i want to happen is repeatedly changing the direction and turn turn turn so i say repeat maybe 10 times or forever it's your choice and then i want turn so turn is the motion so i go to the motion and then say let's turn 15 degree so i click it turns and turns and turns i can do both color change and turn at the same time if i want it to be more interesting but it's 100 percent your choice i just demo everything and then you can go and play but with it and create really cool animations for the next letter i want to play a sound so anytime that i click on this one i want to hear a sound let's see how um i go to the sounds and then from here i can choose a sound you can choose whatever you really like this is cool i choose this one and then i go back to the code and again i say when sprite clicked when this is right clicked now i want to play a sound so i go to the sound and then play sound until done let's see how it works so whenever i click i hear the sound so for the next one i want to create dancing letter animation how i do it is you see on the left corner there is this thing is called extension i click here and then i choose music so what happens something is added here which is the music set of codes so now i have some more codes available to me for playing the music and dancing letter then let's see how we can do that first i'm gonna write this for this i again like always when the sprite is clicked i want to create a dance so let's use a move i go to the motion and then i say move 10 steps and then i go to music i play a sound like play drum for some amount and then i take another move last time i moved 10 steps this time i move minus 10 steps so it moves backward and then i again go to the music and then again i play drum so let's see how this one works you see it goes back and forth i can add the steps a bit more so that it's more clear what's happening so longer moves i have this cool dancing letters here for my last letter which is this e i'm gonna change the size so it grows bigger and becomes smaller with each click so again when sprite clicked when this right is clicked i'm going to repeat a set of actions for 10 times i do something and another 10 times i do different things so i take two of these blocks first time inside this repeat i say change size by 10. i need to drag it to go inside and one more time for the next repeat i say change size by 10 let's see how it looks as i click it grows and then it gets back to the original slice so you see each of these letters have their own animation try to play around with the letters and do similar things with the rest of letters and share your projects with us we are excited to see what you can do in order to make this a bit more interesting i'm going to add a backdrop as well and then i'm going to share your share my project with you and i hope you are going to share yours with us as well i choose a heart as a backdrop you see it's quite a cool project easy and cool if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe
