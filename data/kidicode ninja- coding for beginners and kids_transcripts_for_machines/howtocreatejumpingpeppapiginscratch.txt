i've got something very exciting for you in this video we're going to learn to program in scratch with peppa pig hi i'm eddie i'm peppa pig and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this tutorial peppa pig and i are going to teach you how to make a character jump in scratch let's dive in all right so we're going to make peppa pig jump like the video that you just saw so let's go to scratch.mit.edu and then we click on create okay so we are going to create a peppa pig that jumps like the video that we just saw before this so we go to scratch.mit dot edu and then let's give our project a name jump pink peppa pig all right we need a sprite for that i've already downloaded a peppa pig sprite so i'm gonna upload it from my computer when you wanted to download search for peppa pig png transparent so you search for import it first so you need to search for peppa pig png transparent background and then you can find it in any of this links all right so i have this character here and then i'm going to the costumes i duplicate it and then i'm gonna create two variations so one more variation i delete the hands and i'm gonna draw a different hands pointing upwards so i take this pen and then go into the feel i take this i pick the color from here and now that i have my color i draw a two different hands pointing upwards so now i have this and i have this all right into the code so let's see the video in slow motion once more and see what we should do it is going upwards on the y direction and then coming downwards on the y direction so a few steps up why few steps down so we can write it like this from the motions i can say change y by 10 so it's like it's moving 10 10 1 2 3 4 5 10 upwards and then to go downward i needed to go change y by 10 and since it's jumping up and down repeatedly every movement is being repeated so i go to control and then repeat 10 times going upwards repeat 10 times going downward let's see so it goes up down up down i don't want to keep clicking so i put a forever loop as well around it so that this is gonna be happening forever i don't need to kick anymore so i stop and then i want to make sure when i start the piggy is in the middle of the scene so i go to the motion and i say so when i put it here the location of the x and y is already written for me so i say go to this location first and then do existing i can make the piggy the peppa pig move by clicking on the start so i can say when start clicked i can also make it move with pressing any key that i want but i choose this so when fly clicked go up down up down up down let's put a backdrop as well i'm gonna choose this one and then also let's make it make a noise or sound or something so i go to the sounds and so you can go from here and choose whatever sound that you want i go here i search for a sound let's go to animals and see what is the most relevant this one we don't have exactly the pick sounds we can download it from internet or you can record it by yourself but this might be fun so i'm gonna import this and then here now that i have it i would say start sound or yeah start this you can of course play with this and make it more similar to the one that is in the actual video but it's just for the demo so let's see what if i put it inside the repeat so that we hear it more often so i'm gonna drag it inside much better so comment in the description what do you think we can do to make it better what things we can add to this project and feel free to go to this i'm gonna put the link to the project in the scratch website and feel free to go there and remix it and share your projects in the description i can't wait to see what you're gonna do if you like the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the button so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next week
