hey do you like to learn how to make this let's see welcome to kitty code ninja tutorials this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun hello everyone welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial we are going to see how we can have a really big dance party we will see how we can take turn when we have a lot of people on the floor we will invite each other in the middle of the dance floor and take turns while dancing did you watch the dance feeds party last week if no i put the link below so that you can go and watch it on your own time if not it's not a problem you can join us in this tutorial we will start everything from the scratch and we will code in scratch let's dive in all right in order to create this dance body we need to follow five simple steps and then we need to write it in a language that computer can understand so there are three main steps which are number one go to the center of dance floor and then so we tell the sprite to go to the center of dance floor and dance then we need to tell the sprite to send the message to the next dancer to come to the stage and third one we need to tell the stride to go to a side and let the next dancer come in these three steps are the main steps that are operating the whole dance scenario and then there are two more which is playing a dance music and setting the backdrop and changing the lighting effects which are basically to make it more exciting let's go and see how we can write it in the language of computer alright let's see how we can tell the computer to do these things first we go to scratch.mit.edu and then i click create i delete this cat because i don't need it i'm gonna import three sprites which are my dancers so i click here i choose the dance category then i can choose as many dancers as i want or i can import more dancers from my own computer i choose this one and also i choose the sprite of myself in order to see how you can have the sprite of yourself watch my previous video the link is in the description you don't have to use your own sprite but it's even more fun to have your own sprite on the dance stage all right so i import mine and let's have one more you can import as many dancers as i want in this video i'm showing with three i need to make sure that every sprite has various costumes because each costume is going to be used as a dance pose so this one has which is good this one should have as well and then the one that i imported i'm gonna add more costumes to it so i choose it i go to the costume tab and from here not here back back back i'm gonna choose more customs by uploading from my computer so i upload all the dance poses that i have here all right now we have three sprites with three dance poses now it's time to tell them first dance okay let's start with this one the code for writing the dance is first of all we need to trigger the start button so let's say this sprite is going to start the dancing every first action should be started by when start clicked so i go to the event so i drag when start clicked repeat maybe five times and then i go to the looks change to the next costume by this code this character goes from one costume to another costume five times so it should look like as it's dancing let's see it does but it's so fast so in order to make it more like a dance we go to the control and add some weight in between poses weight zero 0.3 seconds let's test it it's good all right we said that the second step is that each dancer is calling another dancer to the center of the dance floor so let's see how we can do it let's give each character a name so that we can call them juvie okay let's say this one is judy let's call this guy alex and then ellie all right now this one is dancing and then he's going to call another one for calling there is something on the events which is called broadcast so broadcast message one which is calling the other dancer i'm going to broadcast and then i'm creating a new message from here which i say judy's turn okay so broadcast judy's turn so this dancer is dancing five times and then calling the other one so i go to judy and then i say when i receive judy's turn now it's time to for this one to test when i receive judy's turn repeat so the same code for the dance is from the control repeat five times go to the next costume and then i need a bit of weight in between to slow down the changes of the moves wait wait wait it should go inside so when i receive judy's turn i repeat five times next costume and i wait let's run it and see what happens so this one is dancing and then next one dances five times so one more thing we need to add is when alex called ellie ellie should receive it so again here we need to write similar code for eddie as well so i say when i receive ellie's turn again same as the other ones repeat five times or how many times do you like go to next costume a little weight in between and 0.3 and then i'm gonna call judy again so from the events broadcast judy's turn now we should this three people should dance forever everyone is calling the next person all right one more thing we're gonna do is that we want every character every dancer that wants to dance go to the middle of the stage which is this place location zero zero zero we can see the location from here so if i say zero zero zero is where is the center of the screen so we have x and y axis here so in order to locate everyone that is going to the stage in the middle of the screen we can go to the motion and then say go to x and y 0 0. so when i receive it's my turn to dance i go to this location zero and zero and when i'm done with dancing i call the next person and i also move away from the center so i can do glide one second because i wanted to horizontally just go to some direction left or right i keep the y as zero and i change this one to some number like 100 let's test it and see how it looks like so i stop i play it dances and it goes away i do this for another for the other characters as well so any character that is called to go to the dance floor goes to the center and then when it's done glides to the corner so i write it for alex when i receive turn go to zero zero and when i'm done glide to actually not random position glide to location maybe minus 100 and zero and do this the same thing for judy go to zero zero and then at the end glide location x 140 and 0. let's test it and see how it looks like i play so ellie dances goes to the corner so you see everyone that dances moves away and then the next one comes to the center just like a real party you can give your project a proper name from here which i call it dance party 2. and also we can add one thing which is everyone that is coming to the middle see a cloud on top of their head saying like i'm coming or basically showing that they are saying something so i go to le when i receive is my turn i go to this location and i want to see i want to say by writing ellie is coming actually less do it for like ellie is coming this one let's say this one l is coming for a short amount of time so i say say it is coming for maybe one second and then i don't want it to remain forever let's do this for other characters as well so from the looks as soon as it was called i can say hello alex is here and then the same for judy my turn judy is coming and also for one second now i i stop and play to see how it looks like all right now we have two more things to do adding a music and a backdrop and a light and the lighting let's see okay let's add a music to it as well so in order to have a music you first need to go to the sounds and add the music here first so i go here upload the sound upload sound actually if you want to choose some sound from your computer you go to upload sounds otherwise it's easier to just click here and choose a sound i can narrow down to dance and choose something i choose this one so now i have a song i go to my code currently the computer doesn't know that it should use the sound so i need to write a code to tell the computer to play the sound so in order to do that i say when i start click because i want this one to happen as soon as the start is clicked so from the events when start clicked repeat 10 times and then under sound play sound dance until done so i want it to be played 10 times but you can choose how many times that you like so i play and see so cool yay all right what else now we can add a backdrop as well let's go here and then let's choose a backdrop that is nice for a dance stage i like this one and this one let's do this one spotlight so i have a backdrop and one more thing we can do is to change the backdrop lighting so that it looks like the light is changing behind in scratch there is something which is really really cool which is color effect if i go to this backdrop if i click on here i can write a color effect code for the backdrop so that the lighting would be changed so again when start click then i go to the looks and then change color effect by something and i'm gonna repeat this action i'm going to say do this thing forever so i say forever change color effect by 25 and maybe i can put some weight in between so that i see one color and then i wait a bit and then another color so wait maybe one second two seconds or whatever you like maybe just yeah let's play and see how it looks you see the color is being changed we are done with this tutorial well done everyone i'm so proud of you i hope you follow the line feel free to pause the repeat the video and pause whenever you like if the pace is so fast for you i put the link in the description so that you can go to the scratch website and check it out if you want it so that you have access to the whole code share your project with us so that we will see what you have done if you have any idea feel free to put it in the comments how we can make this project better how we can make it more exciting i'm so excited to see your projects congratulations well done everyone in this tutorial you learned how to write your own dance party in scratch if you liked the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so
