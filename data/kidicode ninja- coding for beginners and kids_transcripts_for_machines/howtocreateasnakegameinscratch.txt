hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful let's create a new game which is snake game in this game we have a snake trying to chase a mouse by pressing up down left right arrow and the mouse is running away and whenever i hit the edges i'm game over like this stick around in a minute we are going to see how we can create this fun fun game welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun we're gonna start with the cat except we're gonna delete it bye and then giving your project a good name snake game let's create the surprise we need i'm i'm gonna need a mouse so from animals you can easily pick the mouse or whatever else you would like to let's make it a bit lit smaller like a little mouse and then let's go to the paint and draw the second one i'm gonna zoom in in and choose the color blue or purple blue or whatever you like it's gonna be the snake here and then the outline zero i don't want outline hold shift to draw a square and then one square knot two and then make sure to put it on the center that's it and name it snake this is our snake and this is our mouse now let's also go to backdrop and also choose paint again not this so backdrop and choose paint choose the color i choose the color green and then i choose pattern colored maybe green together with blue yeah and just feel it just draw it square and fill it like this okay this is the background of our game i'm gonna also name this start backdrop and then i will duplicate it and create another one which i'm calling it game over and writing using the text game over i'm writing with green so you won't see it so i should change the color here we go and again when you don't change the color you make a typo so game over okay so we're all set and ready to go to the coding let's start by programming our snake that's also let's go back to empty backdrop so we're not distracted all right going back to the code and we are on the snake sprite first thing when fly clicked going to write the code for movement of the snake i would say forever and then i want to write the code for four directions of movement so that i want the movements to be written for whenever i click right left up and down arrow so i say if and then from the sensing key up arrow pressed then from the motion point towards point in direction and then i'm gonna change it so i'm gonna copy this duplicate three times so that i have four of this if conditions so i say if key is up do this if k is down do this if right do this and if left do something else so if the key up arrow is pressed i want to look up so point to direction zero if key arrow down press look down point direction 180 if key right arrow pressed just 90 like as it is and if left arrow clicked i want to look left so 0.2 direction in direction minus 90. and in all the condition i want to move a few steps like let's say 10 steps what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a variable and name it speed and then i'm going to set speed to 10 so here instead of explicitly saying move 10 step since i've already assigned variable defined variable speed and assign 10 to it i'm gonna say move speed step in this way i can easily play with this number and then this one will be changed one more thing from the motions i would say go to zero zero 0 0 okay so if i press flag i press right left and it's super fast and i can move this okay let's make it a little bit slower so that it's easier to play so the harder the speed the the faster the speed the harder to play you will see why in a minute it doesn't really look like the snake right now but let's see what i'm gonna do to make it look like snake we're gonna use clone for this so to make it look like is a snake not a square i would say when a star clicked go to control and create a clone of my self also do it forever create a clone of my self at this point i'm gonna get something like this still not looking like a snake but what i can do is i define a lifetime for my clone so i define a variable stop it i name it clone lifetime okay and then also i don't want to show any of this variable so i just uncheck and then here i would say going back to control when i start as a clone wait for for as long as the variable clone lifetime and then delete the clone so control and then delete this clone also let's set the clone lifetime to let's say half a second so after half a second the previous clones are deleted so now now it really looks like snake so what else is the mouse should run away otherwise it's boring okay let's see how so we click on the mouse and let's write the code for this one when start clicked i wanted to first go to a random position initially just go somewhere and then forever if um control if touching the snake so in case the snake catches the mouse the mouse should go somewhere else so i want it to glide in one second to a random position let's test it and see what we did so if i'm touching the mouth should move to a random position yeah it's running away and it's gliding to a random position so i try to follow it again and catch it it went really far away okay but then how would the game stop there should be some condition for a game over as well right so let's write that i want to say if my snake touched the edges then i'm gonna finish the game and i'm game over let's write this one so let's stop the game whenever the snake is touching the edges so i would say again when start clicked let's take the if condition if touching the edge touching edge what i want to do is remember we already created a backdrop for a game over so let's go to the looks so i'm switching backdrop to game over and then i'm gonna set the speed to zero so i don't want the snake to move anymore let's go here set speed to zero or maybe let's not do this let's instead stop all stop everything here before stop all let's go to a sound here and then let's choose a sound let's say lose okay let's add this one and then go back to the code so we were here play sound lose until done and then stop all so anything left i don't think so let's try it so i'm going here and then i try to catch the mouse and then let's say i lost uh nothing happened switch back drop to game over oh so we are missing forever so it needs to constantly check this condition so let's try again i'm gonna catch the and mouse game is stopped i hope you liked this video if you did don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you get notification when i upload a new video and see you next
