hello everyone what's up i hope you are all feeling wonderful i'm very excited today today i'm gonna collaborate with chris from one of the most popular scratch tutorial channels on youtube which is coding with chris if you've been doing scratch for a while most probably you have already came across this channel if not i'm gonna put the link to his channel on the description below make sure to go there and check it out i really encourage you to go there and check it out and subscribe it's full of really cool tutorials what i love most about his channel is that over there you can learn to create existing games and lots of cool stuff like big projects and you can put into practice whatever you've learned here or anywhere else about scratch welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun hello to the scratchers on earth how are you guys doing today hope you're all doing fantastic uh but today's video is going to be a little bit of javascript and a little bit of scratch so we're going to compare the two and see how they compare all right so stick around to learn a little bit recently i've been having so much fun with scratch programming i made games animation lots of really cool things you know what i love most about it it was that i didn't need to type a lot of things most things were blocks of code i could drag them put them together and tada a cool project was made so easy so much fun but then i was wondering what if i want to do something more what if i want to make a more powerful program like a web application a game that i can solve something that i can share it with the whole world but not only with scratch community then i had a chat with chris and we decided to give it a try we decided to write the same program in scratch and in javascript to see how it would look like if you want to transition from scratch programming to a more real programming language if you two are on the same boat join us in this video to see how we convert a code from scratch to javascript let's dive in let's say when i have a counter that counts from 0 to 10. i'm gonna delete this cat it's always there i don't want it so first thing i need a variable to use it as a counter i'm going to create a variable i make a variable i name it i so there is a counter here i can click here to make it bigger version so what i'm gonna do is i start from zero so i set i to zero and then i'm going to repeat something 10 times so i'm going to say repeat until a condition is met what i want to happen what i want to do is i'm increasing this number so i would say change i by 1 and before changing i want to show the eyes well and also i need to set the condition to clarify how many times i want it to happen so i go to operator if i want it to go until 10 so i say repeat this until i is until you get to the point that i is more than 9 so i drag this and then i put i here from variable and nine so if i count from zero to nine it's gonna repeat this show variable and change change by 1 10 times what happens is this number is changed super quickly so i'm gonna put weights in between so that i can see the changes so i show i wait and i also put a weight here so that i see so i'm clicking here so that i can see the changes every one second this number is being changed chris can you show us how would it look like if i want to write this in javascript all right ellie so you just created basically a counter so and i need to do that in uh javascript uh so i'm gonna actually change my uh environment you guys can also go and follow this uh website uh it's called playcode.io it's a good place to do javascript if you're just getting started because one good thing that it has it has this kind of live feature where i can just kind of do things i can see things live and this console part is basically where we're going to see the result now it's not as visual as you know scratch you guys probably already know that javascript and this kind of language normally are not as visual but anyways let's let's actually create the counter so you know inside of uh ellie's tutorial just now uh she created a variable called i but why do we call it an i will i is normally what's called an iterator all right and inside of javascript if you want to create a um a for loop basically or a repeat function a repeat loop you would want to create an iterator that will keep a a record of the count of the iteration so i'll say 4 and then we'll say i equals to 0 so this is where we actually declare i and then we will separate the next part with a semicolon and then here we want to say how long we want this for loop to repeat so this is a condition that it needs to keep in mind so i want to say repeat until i is smaller than um you know well let's do i smaller than 10 okay so this this is going to go until 9 but you're going to see in a second and then well what do i want to do every time well all i want to do is to what i want to do after each iteration i want to add one to i so instead of a javascript uh variable name plus plus basically does the same thing as scratch where you say change variable by one you know so it's the same thing this this this one thing is doing the same job as that and then we need to open and close curly braces and here i'm gonna do console.log i okay so let me go live here you'll see that instantly it will print out the numbers zero to nine now of course if i wanted to do one to ten all you need to do is to say start from one so the first i is going to be equal to one okay but then we want to do until 10 right so there's two ways you can go about this you can either change this one to 11 so it will go until 10. so i smaller than 11 the last one would be 10 right so it's going to print until 10 or you could say i smaller or equal to 10 and then this is gonna go ahead and print the same kind of result for you all right so let's see what else ellie wants to teach us in scratch so let's try something else let's say i have a variable named h so i'm gonna make a variable i name it age and then i ask a question which is let's say how old are you and then i want the answer to be displayed here so again i go back to variables and then i'm gonna set the whatever the answer was i want to assign it to h so i go to sensing again and i'm dragging this here to activate it i can use when start clicked so event when start clicked i click start and then when it asks the question i put a number and the number shows up here so let's see how it looks like in javascript all right so this is another one of my favorite parts of scratch where you can actually ask for somebody's input and then there you know you can do something based on that input now having inputs is actually a part of almost all programming languages input output is basically like one of the basics of every programming language that you're going to learn now in javascript specifically in a frontend javascript there's many ways that you can get an input the simplest way that i can tell you that and that is the the one that is closest to um scratch is to use the function called prompt so if i write the word prompt here all right here i can first of all write a message that i want so i'm going to write a message like uh how old are you all right so if i run this program right now you'll see that this kind of popup window comes up and it says how old are you and i'll just kind of let's say i entered the age 10 because i'm 10 years old there all right and then but if i you know click ok right now nothing really happens so we need to store this answer somewhere right so what i'll do here is that i'll say i will store this prompt into a variable h so this is how you create a variable let me stop this right now so that it doesn't kind of live reload so this is how you create a variable you write the keyword let all right and then the name of the variable that you want so now i have a variable h and then the value is going to be taken from the prompt okay so again if i run this right now again if i write it you know the h10 and click ok nothing happens because we haven't still shown the output so i have gotten the number as an input but i still need to show it as an output so how can we do that well again we can use the beautiful function of console.log and then here i can simply either say you know h or let's make it a little bit more interesting u r um and then we will say well and then the age and then years old so if i now go live again and then enter 10 here you can look at here here it says you are 10 years old all right now of course you can get creative with this you know like if i say h times um let me let me close it live if i say h times 365 then we can change this one to days and then this is going to tell you how many days old you are so if you're 10 right now you are uh 3 650 days old all right and you can just kind of play around with this variable as you would inside of scratch as well so you can see that there are a lot of similarities between scratch and other programming languages more specifically javascript and it is really worth it to learn all of these similarities before you actually kind of dive deeper into what the language is and and you know how you can how you can use it so the similarities are very interesting to learn so make sure you do that um so yeah this is it for for today's tutorial this was a great uh collaboration that i had with ellie channel she does uh tutorials from time to time specifically for younger learners so if you have any younger siblings make sure you recommend the channel yeah as you saw and as chris said most programming languages have a lot of commonalities when you learn one language it's going to be very easy to switch a different language so if you're a kid and are not comfortable with typing or you're just intimidated with textbased languages or you would rather see things visually or if you if just a scratch is enough for the purpose of what you want to do keep learning scratch keep writing code in scratch and whenever you need it to learn a different language or do more it's going to be very easy for you to learn a different language thank you so much for watching this video again i reiterate make sure to go to chris channel the link is on the description below there are lots of cool tutorials and regular live scratch tutorials i really hope you enjoyed this video if so please press like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you soon
