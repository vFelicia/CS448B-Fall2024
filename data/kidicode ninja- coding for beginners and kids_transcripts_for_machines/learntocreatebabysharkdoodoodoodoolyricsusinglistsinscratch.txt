hello hello how are you doing i hope you are all feeling wonderful in this tutorial we are going to learn about lists we can use lists when we have a group of values to store that are related but they're more than one like when listen to this song daddy okay so this is a good example of when we can use lists why because if you look at this just is being repeated so here we have a group of variables baby shark mommy shark daddy sharp shark grandma shark and grandpa shark that are related but there are more than one and they're variables so these things are constant and this these ones are being changed so they are variable so this is a good example of when we can use lists so i'm gonna show you a project in scratch that you're gonna write a lyrics for this song and using lists stick around to do it together welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun okay to learn about the list we're gonna create something like this that has a shark family list so a list that is name is a shark family and then it gets the input from us and then as a lyric it will put it on the the sharks like it thinking um it says grandma shark shark so you got the idea we are creating a list and then we are putting a set of variables that are similar and there are more than one like a baby shark mommy shark daddy shark they're all sharks family of sharks and then we're gonna use it how are we gonna use it to recreate the lyrics on the thinking bubble of the shark so let's see how we can write it our goal is to learn to work with the list alright so let's give the project name i call it list and baby okay that's how i name it you can name it whatever you like and then let's delete this let's find a shark the good thing is already there is shark here i'm gonna choose this one and then also backdrop let's choose if i type c or um underwater let's go to underwater and i'm gonna take this one so here we go now let's create a list so if we go to the variables we have the option of make a list i'm going to name my list shark family so okay okay now i have an empty shark family list let's write a code that gets input from us so that we can add items to our list if you look at here there is a code at thing or like something to shrink family let's use this and write our code so like always we ah we need to trigger it by dragging the code when green flag is clicked so when flag is clicked then let's get back to the variables first thing i do is delete all of the shark family so that when i rerun my program i start with a fresh list and then we have like baby shark mama shark daddy shark papa shark grandpa sharks so something is going to be repeated five times so i go to the control and repeat five times and let's say this shark is asking who or like who do you want me to add to the list in order to do that i go to sensing and then what do we have here ask i'm dragging ask instead of this who shall i add or let's say which shark okay and let's get back to the variable and see what we have here on the under the list there is a cool feature at add thing to shark family so add instead of think think whatever is the answer of this question is going to be added to the shark family list so i go back to sensing and there is there should be answer here which is here so add answer to the shark family so this is for feeling the list so what happens is if i click here the shark is asking which shark i say baby shark when it asks again i say daddy shark grandpa shark and so on we can just feel fill the list like this so what i want to happen what i want to do is after the list is completed i want to broadcast a message so that the shark is singing back or writing back the lyrics so somehow i need to announce it so i'm going to the event and here i'm gonna use broadcast message let's create a new message uh i write say the lyric so that the shark when sees this knows that should say the lyric okay okay let's also add the music to our code so let's go to the sound i've already downloaded the song that i want to use the baby shark you can also go ahead and download it i've downloaded the codes so i'm going to upload it here i'm going to import it here also i want to make this smaller and reduce the parts that i do not need it so i'm deleting the extras so that i can start only from the part that i need so i listen to it to make sure that's what i want so i only want to take from baby shark to grandpa shark okay so i listened to the song and then i cut the parts that i do not need and keep the parts that are needed for my code you can do the same as well okay now that the song is there let's go to the code and i want it to be started as soon as i click on the green flag so when green flag clicked again to the sound star sound and star sound but play sound until done done okay let's get to the most exciting part of it which is filling the items to the list so i played this and i listen to what i hear and then when the shark asks the question i answered the baby daddy grab my shirt okay now we have a list full of the items that we want them the next is we want the music to be played again and this time we are using the items in the list so that a cloud comes at the top of the shark's head and saying the lyrics of the song while you are doing nothing while you are sitting and watching it so let's see how we can write the code for this so remember here we use broadcast say the lyrics i'm gonna use it in the events when i receive say the lyrics i'm gonna stop all the sounds so that this song is gonna start again and then i'm gonna start it again start the sound then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna loop around the list so i'm going to point to this and this and this and this and this and use it as a thinking message so let's see what i'm saying i'm going to control and i'm going to repeat several times later on we can change it let's say five times because we have five items here five times i wanna think so not me but the shark is gonna think about anything that is written here i don't want to manually write baby shark i want to use my list that's why we have created the list so if you look at the list here we can say think about item one of shark family i'm gonna repeat five times think item number one and then item number two and so on of the list so if i click on this i would see baby shy here i want to see the same thing for item 2 3 4 5 and so on but i don't want to repeat it i'm going to use a counter so let's create a variable make a variable name it counter okay and then set the counter to 1 i'm gonna also set the counter to one at the beginning of the program as well so that when i'm finished it's reset again so i set the counter to one and i think item instead of one i would use a counter and then so five times think item one item two item three item five for two seconds and then change counter by one so here on the variable change counter by one i want to also think about the fixed part of the song the lyric so i would also think dude one more okay let's also add a bit of cosmetic to it so let's use multiple costumes so that the shark doesn't look the same all the time so like this next costume so i think go to next costume we can also change the color effect a little bit so that it looks like the the shark color would be changed slowly slowly like this instead of repeat 5 which is length of the array there is something really cool here which is length of charge family so i didn't need to count five i could just take repeat this as long as there is something in the list length of shy family like this now let's run it and see what we did okay daddy now look at here so the lyrics are showing here so our code is working pretty good but the timing doesn't match which you can play with this times and put a bit more delays in between so that you can figure out how to match it i hope you liked this video and you learned something lists are very very useful in programming you can do a lot of things with it this was just one example but if you learn this you can do a lot of things with the list if you like the video don't forget to press like subscribe and hit the bell and share it with your friends so that other smart people like yourself would learn something see you next week bye
