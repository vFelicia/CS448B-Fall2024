hello and welcome to another cuticle ninja tutorial this is ellie and this is your place to learn to code and have fun in this video peppa pig's fish friend is gliding back home and peppa pig needs to jump into the fish tank to be able to meet his fish friend now we are going to see how we can make peppa pig jump into the fish tank so that they can reunite let's dive in what we need for this is a sprite i specifically choose peppa pig because i like it and if you want to see how to import it and make it jump watch my previous video that the link is in the description i'm gonna quickly show it here but for more details you can watch the previous video so i've already have my sprite you can actually use any sprite that you like but it's just my choice so instead i'm not going to use this cat i'm gonna quickly create a different costume for it as well by deleting the hands and drawing a different the same hand pointing upward actually so like this so i have two customs and then one more which is the fish bowl and the backdrop as well actually not upload but just choose the search and any simple backdrop with work it's just the matter of choice yes the simple one and then peppa pig should fit in this so i'm gonna make it triple size which looks a good fit so first thing making the peppa pig jump i've already explained this in the previous video so i'm just quickly bringing it up without saying anything the jump is that we repeat 10 times moving upwards by changing y and 10 times going downwards by changing y to a minus value and it's controlled by pressing space key so if i press space it goes so i'm just like pressing the space key it goes up and down now let's get to the fish what i want to be done with the fish is i want it to start from here and then i want it to glide all over to the end so in order to do that when the start is clicked i want it to be in the initial position of the this one what happens with positioning is if i put it here put the sprite here and then i click on the code here the position is already updated to whatever i want now i want it to glide to the left side of the screen so i drag it here when i drag it the position is also updated here but then i need the code for gliding so glide one second to this location and i want it to be not in one second but i want it to be maybe five seconds so that i give the peak enough time to jump and show the various things that we want to happen so i'm going to press start so that we see what's going on didn't glide for some reason because this location is not correct so i drag it here now i see the correct one the minus one so this one should be minus now let's see what's happening i press start the fish is gliding and peppa is jumping but now what we want is first thing i don't want the fish to glide only once i want it to repeat forever so that it looks like it's constantly coming so i put four over here now it's like this pepper can jump up but then i want the the pepper to go inside the fish bowl so that can meet the fish in order to do that let's see what we can do i'm clicking on the peppa again so that i can modify this a little bit more so what i want is when i press the space bar the pepper jumps but then i would the peak should try to go in the bowl so how do i know it using sensing so i would say when i put a if condition an if then condition i want this change to be out so out come on okay so if sensing guess what i want to sense if sensing touching color so if it's sensing the color of the fish or something in the fishbowl i don't want this color because i stop this and what i'm going to do is i pick that color picker and then i put it on the fish so when if it's touching this color then i broadcast a message broadcasting is on the event so i broadcast a message a new message in the bowl in a minute you will see why i'm doing it so i have an event broadcast in the bowl so this is what we have so far just like this so we already broadcasted if touching color broadcast in the bowl so i assume that the pepper has jumped inside the bowl and is touching the fish this color which is the fish now i want the fish to react to it so i go to the fish and then i write a block of code a piece of code for when i receive that in the bowl if i receive it i want first i want the custom of this fishbowl be changed to this one so that it looks like the pepper is covering the fish or is replacing the fish so first thing on the looks switch costume to the fishbowl b and then a small weight um maybe half a second and then switching back to the custom that originally was so the fish should be appeared again i go look switch custom to the stein fishbowl a and also when it goes in the water i want to also make a sound of like plunge so i search for it and then i add it to my sounds when it's added now i can drag the code play sound time until done so let's give it a test so i play space bar i need to be careful to try to hit the ball okay something is not working let's see what is not okay the is because the peak is behind this so initial state right away when start clicked i want the fishbowl to be on the front so i say i can either say show or go to the front layer it might be better okay so if i press start you see when he's touching the fish it's making the difference like the water jump waters splashing sound so when i press start i can jump and then if i jump quick enough to touch the fish it makes the sound that i want it and the fish disappears so only make sure that this location is uh down enough so that when it's jumping down it's touching the fish or you can adjust it in the code as well if you like the video don't forget to like subscribe and hit the bell so that you won't miss the next tutorial see you next
