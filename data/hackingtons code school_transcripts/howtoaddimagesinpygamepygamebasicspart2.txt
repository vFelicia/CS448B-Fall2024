00:00 - and we've got an image on her screen
00:04 - [Music]
00:14 - all right so in our PI game here we have
00:18 - a blue square that moves to the right
00:20 - when I press the key in my PI game
00:23 - window now we don't have the rest of the
00:24 - movement working quite yet but I'm
00:26 - really excited to add an image into my
00:29 - game so let's do that right now so I
00:31 - want to put an image in place of this
00:34 - square because as much as I love games
00:36 - about squares it's not exactly what I
00:39 - want so I'm gonna go to Google Images
00:41 - here and I'm just going to search for
00:43 - ball and then I'm going to choose images
00:47 - and then what I'm gonna do is I'm on
00:49 - DuckDuckGo but on google you would
00:51 - choose color and transparent I'm gonna
00:53 - change that type to transparent and then
00:55 - I will also add in PNG at the end of it
00:59 - so that I know it's a PNG file format so
01:02 - I can click on this gold ball here it
01:04 - looks pretty good I want to double check
01:06 - it and make sure the background on the
01:08 - image is a checkerboard pattern this
01:11 - means that the background is transparent
01:12 - if it's not transparent then when we add
01:15 - it into our game you'll still have a
01:17 - square it'll just be a ball inside of
01:19 - the square we wanted to actually be
01:21 - round so we're going to choose this
01:22 - image right here I'm going to right
01:24 - click and save the image as not open a
01:28 - new tab or save link as I want save
01:30 - image as and then I can just call it a
01:35 - gold ball and I'm just gonna save it in
01:38 - downloads you can save it anywhere you
01:39 - want as long as you can find it because
01:41 - when I come back to my game here I can
01:43 - then drag it into repla now I have this
01:47 - gold ball PNG image that's part of my
01:50 - project so now that it's part of my
01:52 - project I want to actually use it I want
01:55 - to load it into my game so I'm going to
01:56 - go down here underneath screen but you
01:59 - can kind of do this wherever you'd like
02:01 - and I'm gonna do a ball IMG new variable
02:05 - and it's gonna store that loaded image
02:07 - so I'm gonna say PI game dot image dot
02:10 - load I'm gonna load in an image it takes
02:12 - one parameter what image I need to type
02:14 - in the exact name of the file so I'm
02:17 - gonna say gold underscore ball dot PNG
02:20 - don't forget the file type that dot PNG
02:23 - is important and now if I run my game
02:29 - and nothing nothing happens there's a
02:31 - gold ball over here
02:32 - why why why didn't it show up well I've
02:35 - loaded it but I never actually drew it
02:37 - so I'm gonna go down here in my while
02:40 - loop and I'm just going to comment out
02:41 - the drawing of the rectangle I'm not
02:43 - going to delete it because I might need
02:45 - it in a second or two here I might also
02:47 - need to reference some of the variables
02:49 - that are in there some of the values
02:50 - that are in there and then I'm gonna say
02:52 - screen dot B lit that's right be lit
02:56 - screen and then I'm going to use the
02:59 - name of the variable that has the image
03:01 - loaded in it and then I'm going to pass
03:04 - in the position that we want it to
03:06 - render it well because I have a variable
03:08 - that's already keeping track of the
03:09 - exposition I'm going to enter that in as
03:12 - the exposition and then for the Y
03:14 - position well let's just create a
03:16 - variable for the Y position so I'm going
03:19 - to do player Y and then I'm going to
03:21 - create that variable up here just so
03:26 - that if we change it like maybe I kind
03:29 - of what we're doing here uh
03:31 - now it will draw on the screen it's
03:33 - gonna go and stop I'm going to hit run
03:37 - and we've got an image on our screen
03:40 - alright so if you chose an image that's
03:42 - actually small enough to fit on the
03:44 - canvas you would be done right here you
03:46 - would have the image on the screen and
03:48 - it would be working great and we can see
03:50 - that it does move to the right when I
03:52 - hit the right arrow key because we're
03:54 - still using that variable and all of
03:56 - that but that's how you add an image on
03:58 - to your screen
