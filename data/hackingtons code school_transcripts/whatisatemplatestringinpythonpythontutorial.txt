00:00 - all right today we're gonna take a look
00:01 - at what's called template strings or
00:04 - string template II what it allows us to
00:06 - do is pass in a variable into a string
00:09 - and replace it without doing any sort of
00:11 - crazy concatenation let's look at an
00:14 - example of it
00:17 - [Music]
00:22 - you
00:27 - so the first thing that we need to do is
00:29 - import a library so from string which is
00:32 - the string library we're going to import
00:34 - a specific set of functions called
00:37 - template then we're going to go ahead
00:39 - and create our template so I'm going to
00:40 - create a variable I'm just going to call
00:42 - it as and I set it equal to a template
00:45 - now when I pass in these parentheses is
00:47 - the actual string template that we're
00:50 - going to be using so I'm gonna say
00:52 - single quotes dollar sign
00:56 - who likes and then dollar sign
01:01 - what now those words that have the
01:04 - dollar sign right in front of them are
01:06 - the actual variables that we're going to
01:08 - replace in our string so now that we've
01:10 - created a string we can actually do our
01:14 - substitutions so we're gonna go ahead
01:17 - and so that we can see it we're gonna
01:18 - print but you can ignore the print
01:20 - statement if you're going to use this
01:21 - someplace else and we're gonna say grab
01:23 - that template that we made and we're
01:25 - gonna do a safe underscore substitute
01:29 - now a safe substitution allows us to
01:32 - actually print this stream out it
01:34 - actually prints it as a string it
01:36 - actually creates a string out of it
01:38 - instead of something that we would have
01:40 - to use manipulate and use later so safe
01:42 - substitute if you want to see it right
01:44 - away just substitute if you have other
01:46 - plans for it and then in the parenthesis
01:48 - we pass in the assignee so we're gonna
01:52 - grab that whoo variable and we're gonna
01:54 - sign it let's put my name in there sure
01:57 - why not and then a comma and the next
02:00 - one which is what and we're gonna set
02:02 - that one equal to soccer something like
02:05 - that so now when I hit run we can see
02:08 - that it prints out Stephen likes soccer
02:11 - because it substituted the word Stephen
02:13 - in for who with the dollar sign in front
02:15 - of it and the word soccer in front of
02:18 - the what with the dollar sign in front
02:19 - of it so that's substitution but when
02:22 - would you ever use this well if you're
02:25 - making an app that required you to be
02:27 - able to read it in other languages so
02:30 - let's say you write a Python program and
02:33 - you export it to a Windows Exe file well
02:37 - you could actually tie a Google
02:39 - Translate API into
02:41 - so that it would translate all of the
02:44 - text and replace it based on the country
02:46 - of origin in which it was downloaded in
02:48 - that's really cool so all of the the
02:51 - submit buttons and everything that you
02:53 - hard code into the app can actually be
02:55 - dynamically changed based on the
02:57 - language or may be based on some other
03:01 - factors I don't know you can get super
03:03 - creative with this even though it seems
03:05 - like it's a very very narrow use case
03:07 - but it's cool and it's something small
03:09 - and super quick that we could show you
03:11 - so I really want to see what you can do
03:14 - with this if you can actually get it to
03:15 - translate something put it in the
03:17 - comments I want to see that I want to
03:20 - see that so bad I'll be soaked with
03:21 - every mind-blowing I don't even know if
03:24 - you could do could could you guys even
03:26 - do that I don't know give it a try
03:29 - go out there try it out and if you like
03:33 - this and you wanted to see more Python
03:34 - lessons head over to hacking INSCOM and
03:36 - sign up for a free trial we have tons of
03:39 - Python curriculum on there and you get
03:41 - help from me personally and the other
03:43 - awesome super highly educated and
03:46 - incredible teachers that we have it
03:47 - hacking is
