00:00 - hello everyone this is teacher andrew
00:02 - and today
00:03 - i wanted to show you how to remove the
00:05 - background on an image
00:07 - you might find this useful for a website
00:09 - that you're building
00:11 - or maybe even a unity project or
00:13 - javascript game
00:15 - the first thing that we want to do is
00:17 - find our source image
00:18 - today we're going to be looking for a
00:20 - good dog
00:22 - let's see what we can find on google
00:24 - images
00:29 - all right here we have a good selection
00:31 - of excellent dogs
00:33 - let's go ahead and pick this one right
00:35 - click save image as
00:37 - and i'm going to change the name to good
00:39 - boy
00:41 - notice that the format is a jpeg this
00:44 - means
00:45 - that the image will not have a
00:46 - transparent background
00:50 - but if you're not there is a way that we
00:52 - can remove the background on this
00:54 - excellent dog in fact there are several
00:57 - different
00:58 - ways of going about this you can use a
01:00 - photo editor like photoshop
01:02 - but today we're just going to google a
01:04 - tool that will help us remove the
01:06 - background
01:07 - let's search for background removal and
01:10 - the first site that comes up for me
01:12 - is this remove.bg site
01:16 - all we have to do is upload our source
01:18 - image
01:20 - it looks like my image is on my desktop
01:23 - so navigate to your desktop and select
01:26 - file
01:30 - and here you can see that it's already
01:31 - removed the image when i click the
01:33 - download button to download
01:35 - the removed background version of this
01:37 - image and if i put them side by side
01:40 - in preview on my computer uh it shows
01:43 - the transparent background as black on
01:46 - your computer it might use a
01:47 - checkerboard pattern
01:48 - like you see on the website now is a
01:51 - good time to mention some internet
01:53 - safety
01:54 - when you use online tools like these be
01:57 - sure to keep in mind your common sense
02:00 - if it seems like the site might be
02:01 - sketchy or if you're not sure if it's
02:03 - safe to use
02:04 - ask your instructor now
02:08 - let's drop our photos into unity to see
02:10 - what they look like
02:11 - this is just a brand new 2d unity
02:13 - project
02:14 - and i have my photos on the desktop
02:18 - we're just going to drag the pictures
02:19 - from the desktop into the projects
02:21 - window
02:22 - to import them into unity you can see
02:25 - the little
02:25 - plus sign is there when you hover over
02:28 - the project window
02:30 - now we're going to rename this dog to
02:33 - have a more convenient name
02:35 - and then all you have to do is drag it
02:37 - into your unity scene
02:39 - and we can see that one of them has a
02:41 - background and one of them does not
02:44 - so super simple just drag them into
02:47 - unity
02:48 - and you should see the difference right
02:49 - away thank you so much for joining us
02:51 - and i hope you learned something new
02:53 - today
