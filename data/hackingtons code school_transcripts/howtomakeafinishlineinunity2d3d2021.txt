00:00 - let's make a finish line this will work
00:01 - in both 2d and
00:03 - 3d i'm going to show you in 2d and then
00:04 - i'll just show you the things that you
00:06 - need to adjust
00:07 - to make it work in 3d so i have a very
00:10 - very simple project here this is just a
00:13 - a copy of like color bump that you can
00:15 - find on the app store it's basically
00:17 - just
00:17 - a 2d game where i'm controlling the
00:19 - white dot the white other white dots
00:21 - don't hurt me
00:22 - but the red dots restart my level and
00:25 - i'm going to add a finish line to this
00:26 - so i'm going to go ahead and go into my
00:29 - game here
00:30 - and i am just going to right click and
00:33 - create
00:33 - a 2d sprite and let's create a 2d square
00:38 - that's this square right here and i want
00:41 - it to be a finish line so i'm going to
00:42 - make sure that it covers the entire
00:44 - length or width of where i want the
00:46 - character to finish
00:47 - now if you're doing this in 3d you would
00:49 - create a 3d
00:51 - cube and then stretch it so i'm going to
00:54 - grab
00:54 - the corner stretch here and go blue
00:58 - and then go blue and now it is stretched
01:01 - out
01:01 - to the entire length that i want the
01:03 - finish line to be
01:04 - and i'm going to go ahead and for now
01:07 - you don't have to do this but you can
01:08 - turn off the sprite render
01:09 - and then it's an invisible finish line
01:11 - you can use these for checkpoints
01:13 - or for something like that that you
01:14 - don't want the actual finish line to be
01:15 - physically
01:16 - visible for the tutorial let's go ahead
01:19 - and keep the spread
01:20 - sprite renderer on now i'm going to go
01:22 - ahead and add a
01:24 - box collider 2d if this is a 3d game
01:27 - object you're just going to add a box
01:29 - collider but because this is 2d
01:31 - box collider 2d and then the very first
01:33 - thing i'm going to do is mark it
01:35 - as trigger this is a trigger this is
01:38 - optional
01:38 - if you want your player to actually
01:39 - collide with the finish line and stop
01:41 - moving then you don't have to mark it as
01:43 - a trigger but i want my player to
01:45 - go into the finish line but not actually
01:47 - hit it that way
01:49 - the enemies that i bump and anything
01:51 - else that's moving on the scene doesn't
01:52 - hit the finish line and then stop they
01:54 - just pass right through
01:56 - all right so i have is trigger here i'm
01:58 - also going to double check my player and
01:59 - make sure it's tagged
02:00 - as player that makes way more sense than
02:04 - just leaving it as
02:06 - untagged that way when i go in my right
02:08 - and i'm writing my code
02:09 - it makes more sense okay so i have my
02:11 - finish line here box collider on it
02:14 - marked as a trigger now let's write a
02:15 - script so i'm gonna add a component
02:17 - i'm gonna choose to name it
02:21 - finish line so i just called my script
02:24 - finish
02:25 - line and create a new script it's going
02:28 - to be called finish line and create an
02:29 - ad you can't see that on my screen it's
02:31 - further down but we're going to create
02:32 - and add this script
02:33 - this script is going to sit on this
02:35 - finish line you can
02:36 - create it other places and add it to
02:38 - other game objects if you want but i
02:39 - know that my script is only going to be
02:41 - accessible from this finish line let's
02:43 - go ahead and open it up all right the
02:45 - first thing that we need to do is we
02:46 - need to be able to access the scene
02:48 - manager
02:48 - that manages our scene so we have seen
02:51 - level one and scene level two well the
02:53 - scene manager allows us to write code
02:55 - that ties those two together so we're
02:57 - gonna say using unity
02:59 - engine dot scene management semicolon
03:02 - awesome now we're not going to do
03:05 - anything in our start or anything in our
03:07 - update all we're going to do is we're
03:08 - going to add a new function you can
03:09 - actually delete those other two if you
03:10 - want
03:11 - actually let's do that we don't need
03:12 - start or update
03:14 - any of those let's go ahead and we're
03:16 - going to say on trigger
03:18 - enter 2d so void on
03:21 - trigger enter and we're going to choose
03:23 - 2d if you're doing 3d it's just going to
03:24 - be on trigger enter
03:26 - so on trigger enter 2d it takes a
03:29 - parameter that is of a collider 2d and
03:31 - it's called
03:32 - collision so collision is going to track
03:35 - everything that has
03:36 - entered in to this trigger so
03:39 - we only want it to trigger the next
03:41 - level if the player
03:43 - is the one that enters the finish line
03:45 - so we're going to say
03:47 - if collision
03:50 - dot tag
03:54 - equals equals
03:57 - player we tagged our player as
04:00 - player now we're saying if the thing
04:02 - that collided with this trigger
04:05 - find that tag if it happens to be player
04:08 - then do this stuff
04:10 - now we're going to go to the next level
04:12 - so we're going to call
04:13 - scene manager dot
04:17 - load scene and we could just pass in
04:20 - the build index of the scene that we
04:22 - want to go to
04:24 - so if this is the final level in your
04:26 - game
04:27 - you can pass in a spec just the build
04:30 - index of your u1 screen
04:32 - right here but that doesn't help us if
04:35 - we want to go from level one to level
04:37 - two
04:37 - and use the same script to go from level
04:39 - two to level three
04:40 - if we say go to level two then when we
04:43 - finish level two
04:44 - it will also just go to level two so
04:46 - we're gonna do something a little clever
04:48 - we're gonna grab that scene manager
04:49 - again
04:51 - and we're gonna do load active scene
04:57 - sorry get active scene that's going to
04:59 - get the active scene that we're in
05:01 - now this is a function so it's going to
05:03 - take those parentheses
05:04 - and then we're going to call the build
05:06 - index of the active scene that we're on
05:09 - and we're gonna increase it by one so
05:12 - what this does it says find out what
05:14 - scene we're on
05:15 - grab the build index for it and just
05:17 - increase it by one
05:19 - now let's save this the script here is
05:22 - done
05:22 - but we're not quite done we are
05:25 - referencing a build index but what is
05:28 - that
05:28 - well when we go
05:32 - to file build settings we get this menu
05:36 - right here where we have the
05:38 - scenes in build so what we can do
05:42 - is grab our scenes drag them in here and
05:44 - put them in
05:45 - the order in which we want them to
05:47 - happen and we can see these
05:49 - numbers on the right hand side that's
05:51 - the build index
05:52 - so when we're on level one and we
05:54 - collide
05:55 - with the finish line it says okay grab
05:57 - level one
05:58 - grab the build index related to level
06:01 - one or the scene that we're on
06:03 - add one to it which is now one now load
06:06 - that scene
06:07 - and that's this is the magic this is
06:10 - what helps you
06:11 - do your uh your level progression your
06:14 - finish line stuff is this
06:15 - build settings place right here if you
06:17 - do have them out of order
06:19 - if you have a random menu screen in here
06:22 - you will go to the menu
06:23 - instead of going to the next scene this
06:25 - code relies on that your levels are in
06:27 - the order in which you want the user or
06:29 - the player
06:30 - to progress through now that we have
06:32 - that done let's check it out so i'm
06:33 - going to go ahead and hit play here
06:35 - i'm going to go through my game the
06:36 - cheater way i'm going to hit the finish
06:38 - line
06:38 - and boom we've gone to level two you can
06:40 - see right here we are
06:41 - now on level two this script works and
06:44 - there's no finish line on level two so
06:46 - there's no place to go but if there was
06:47 - a level three
06:48 - it would also work for level three
06:50 - alright build this add this to your game
06:52 - it's super cool
