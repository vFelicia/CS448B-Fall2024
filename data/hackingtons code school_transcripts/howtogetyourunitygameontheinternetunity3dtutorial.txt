00:00 - hello everyone today we're going to
00:01 - learn about how to build your project so
00:03 - that it can run in a web browser
00:06 - here's my unity project it's all done
00:09 - and ready to go so i'm going to build it
00:11 - this process is the same on mac in
00:14 - windows today i'm going to be using a
00:16 - windows computer
00:17 - so first i'm going to go up to file
00:20 - and then build settings this will bring
00:22 - up a new window called build settings
00:25 - and i can add in the scenes that i want
00:27 - to be in my game right now i have only
00:30 - one scene and if i wanted to add another
00:33 - scene i can click add open scenes
00:35 - that'll add the scene that's open in the
00:36 - editor right now
00:38 - i can also go to the project view and
00:40 - drag in new scenes if i want to add more
00:43 - i'm going to make sure that webgl is
00:45 - selected as the platform if you don't
00:47 - have webgl installed then wait till the
00:49 - end of the video and we'll show you how
00:51 - to install it then next we have to make
00:53 - sure we have a folder for the project to
00:55 - build into what i usually do is i
00:59 - make a new folder on the desktop of my
01:01 - computer this way it's easy to find
01:04 - then
01:05 - in unity
01:06 - i open build settings
01:08 - and i click build
01:10 - it asks me where do i want to build this
01:13 - project so i'm going to click on the
01:14 - desktop and find
01:16 - the turkey challenge folder that i just
01:18 - made there it is turkey challenge
01:21 - select folder
01:23 - and then it starts building the project
01:26 - don't interrupt it while it's building
01:27 - it's a big process taking your unity
01:31 - project and building it into something
01:33 - that can run in a web browser this is
01:35 - going to take a few minutes
01:38 - now that the project's done building i
01:40 - can go down here it says build completed
01:42 - with the result of succeeded in 27
01:45 - seconds but we're not done yet we have
01:47 - to actually put this on the internet
01:49 - somewhere for us to be able to use so
01:51 - i'm gonna go to netlifly netlifly.com
01:54 - drop
01:55 - this is where we can host
01:57 - our game it's pretty easy to set up but
02:00 - you do need to make sure that you're
02:02 - signed into an account if you're not
02:04 - signed in go ahead and make an account
02:06 - you will need an email address so if you
02:08 - don't have one ask your parents to help
02:10 - you it's free it's just a way of hosting
02:13 - your unity game
02:14 - on the internet so that anyone can play
02:16 - it once you're all signed in
02:18 - go ahead and drag that folder that has
02:20 - your build in it into the spot that says
02:23 - drag and drop it'll upload and create a
02:25 - website
02:26 - where you can actually run your unity
02:28 - game
02:29 - there we go
02:30 - it works
02:32 - excellent
02:39 - now we can take this
02:41 - and we can post this to hackington's
02:46 - you can submit this just like any other
02:48 - project in hackington's
02:50 - now if you make updates to your project
02:53 - you don't have to create a whole new
02:56 - website you can actually update this
02:59 - link in netlify
03:01 - if you go to netlifly.com
03:03 - you can go to sites and you can see
03:07 - all of the different websites that you
03:08 - have these are all my different unity
03:10 - games that i've made i can click on my
03:12 - most recent one it gave it a random name
03:15 - that i can change if i want
03:17 - and if i want to update it i can go to
03:19 - deploys
03:20 - here i would just drag my new build
03:22 - folder
03:23 - and
03:24 - drag it in and it'll update you don't
03:27 - have to make a new website every time
03:29 - you update your game
03:30 - sometimes your build might not work or
03:32 - you might have a problem building let's
03:34 - talk about some of the common issues
03:36 - that come up
03:37 - say for example you don't have webgl
03:39 - installed it won't let you build a web
03:42 - gl game
03:43 - if this happens open up unity hub
03:46 - and go to installs
03:48 - then find the version of unity that
03:50 - you're using in this case
03:52 - my turkey test project is using unity
03:54 - version
03:56 - 2021.1
03:58 - i go to installs i find that version and
04:00 - i can add modules
04:02 - here i can
04:04 - select what things do i need to have in
04:06 - this installation of unity in this case
04:09 - i just want webgl support in windows
04:11 - build support once i have those i'll
04:13 - notice that it has little icons here and
04:16 - it's ready to go the other issue that
04:18 - can come up you build your game it
04:20 - uploads to the internet but when you go
04:22 - to play it it won't load
04:25 - and then if you inspect the page you
04:26 - might even see some errors in the
04:28 - console so we're going to change some of
04:30 - the build settings open up build
04:32 - settings and then go to player settings
04:34 - this will bring up a new window make
04:36 - sure that you're looking at the player
04:38 - settings here and then go to publishing
04:41 - settings in this menu and go to
04:43 - compression format and set it to be
04:45 - disabled
04:48 - this will make sure that when you build
04:50 - your project you won't run into this
04:52 - problem if you have any other problems
04:53 - building your project just let us know
04:55 - in the messages let's see what you can
04:57 - build in unity
