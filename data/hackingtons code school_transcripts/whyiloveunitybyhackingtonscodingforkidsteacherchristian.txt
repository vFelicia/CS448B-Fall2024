00:00 - what is happening everybody i am
00:01 - christian with the game division here at
00:03 - hackington's code school for kids and i
00:04 - am
00:05 - super excited to talk to you about
00:07 - something that i wish existed when i was
00:09 - a kid
00:09 - it's called unity and let me tell you
00:11 - why i love it for me
00:12 - as a game designer i love coming up with
00:15 - new ideas for games and mechanics and
00:17 - systems
00:17 - and testing them out i have books full
00:20 - of these ideas
00:22 - and with unity i can open this up flip
00:24 - to a page and
00:26 - start trying some of them putting them
00:27 - into the game engine and seeing what
00:29 - happens so i'm stoked that we offer this
00:32 - at
00:32 - hackington's because when we learn unity
00:34 - together we get to see what we can come
00:36 - up with and create ourselves unity is a
00:39 - fully featured game engine
00:40 - what that means is if someone were to
00:42 - say hey pop the hood of your
00:44 - game let me see what's underneath they
00:45 - would get a good look at the unity
00:47 - engine
00:48 - see game engines have changed a lot
00:50 - since when i first remember them
00:51 - in fact the very first game engine i
00:53 - ever played around with was on a single
00:55 - floppy disk
00:56 - and it was called zzzt and i remember
00:58 - explicitly because i didn't ever have a
01:00 - pc
01:01 - up to that point so this idea of like
01:02 - typing commands was completely foreign
01:05 - long story short what was great about it
01:07 - for me as a designer
01:08 - was that it allowed for me for once to
01:10 - actually play around with the game
01:12 - mechanics inside a game
01:13 - rather than have to create my own game
01:15 - from the ground up oh fun fact
01:17 - this same company that made zzt went on
01:20 - to make fortnite you may be wondering
01:22 - how is unity any different than say
01:23 - scratch or roblox unity lets you
01:26 - make your games your way in your style
01:29 - and to release on hardware of your
01:32 - choosing
01:32 - think of unity as a way for you to
01:36 - take your game idea and to actually
01:39 - realize it and put it somewhere where
01:40 - you want it to
01:41 - it is the software that professionals
01:43 - are using today to make their games
01:45 - if you want to be a game designer there
01:48 - is nothing
01:48 - preventing you from creating whatever
01:50 - play style you imagine
01:52 - from fast-paced action games to
01:55 - turn-based strategies
01:56 - or story-based role-playing games now if
01:59 - you're an artist whose visual style has
02:01 - never been seen in games before
02:03 - you can showcase it with unity it
02:05 - supports everything you want to do in 2d
02:07 - or 3d art styles
02:08 - it has advanced features for creating
02:10 - amazing lighting and shader details
02:12 - so if you're up for the challenge and
02:14 - you think that making games is as fun as
02:16 - i do
02:16 - then i invite you to come try unity with
02:18 - us and see
02:20 - what we can do together
