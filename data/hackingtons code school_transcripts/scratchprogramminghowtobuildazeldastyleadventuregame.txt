00:00 - have you ever built an adventure game
00:02 - where you're a scratch cat looking for
00:04 - the key to unlock the door to go to the
00:07 - next level well I'm gonna show you how
00:09 - to build one of those games now you'll
00:11 - notice there's no sound there's no bad
00:13 - guys there's no good guys there's no
00:15 - points you're gonna need to add all of
00:17 - those elements I'll show you the basics
00:20 - and then you make it incredible
00:22 - let's get coding adventure games need
00:25 - lots of different backdrops or scenes so
00:27 - that the character can travel from one
00:29 - backdrop to the next one so let's start
00:32 - with backdrops and it's called the stage
00:35 - menu if you just click on stage and then
00:38 - you'll have access to the backdrop menu
00:40 - that works pretty well that way you can
00:42 - start modifying that first backdrop now
00:46 - one thing I've learned is that in vector
00:49 - mode which is where this art editor
00:51 - starts you can't really just paint the
00:54 - backdrop you'd actually have to drag a
00:58 - box around the whole backdrop but hold
01:01 - on let me just undo this what you can do
01:04 - to save some time convert it to bitmap
01:07 - paint it and then convert it back to
01:10 - vector and then you're good to go
01:13 - isn't that crazy it's like a little tip
01:15 - do we want a purple starting screen
01:18 - not really but now that I'm back in
01:20 - vector mode I don't think I can actually
01:23 - just paint it I have to convert it back
01:25 - to bitmap paint it convert it back to
01:27 - bit I'm being converted so many
01:30 - different times good this will be our
01:31 - starting screen and then we'll make
01:34 - another scene so we'll best way is
01:38 - probably just to well come right here
01:40 - and say paint a new scene and then this
01:43 - one will be called seen one land one I'm
01:47 - gonna call it level one there make sure
01:50 - you label these these scenes or these
01:53 - backdrops because it's very important
01:55 - let's add another one and it will be
01:58 - called level 2 and if you have like ones
02:02 - in the dude forest or ones in the jungle
02:04 - you can name it that as well
02:05 - there we go level 2 and for my game I'm
02:09 - just gonna have two levels your game is
02:11 - going to be much more
02:13 - complex because wow we're in the
02:14 - advanced scratch game building we want
02:17 - it to be advanced so let me show you
02:19 - what the basic levels for this kind of
02:22 - adventure gaming it look like first you
02:25 - are going to have like being the forest
02:28 - or in under the water or wherever you're
02:30 - gonna be I'm going to choose forest for
02:33 - mine I'm gonna make both of mine the
02:35 - same kind of a green background then I'm
02:38 - going to convert it back to back vector
02:40 - if I'm going back and forth so much I'm
02:42 - going to actually draw kind of like the
02:46 - maze
02:46 - we've done that before and my maze is
02:49 - going to be the color brown kind of like
02:51 - a hedge or brown hedge well a hedge that
02:54 - you've never watered before there's is
02:57 - that the color brown I don't know this
03:00 - is getting more difficult okay so we
03:03 - need to make this number quite large
03:05 - let's use 40 let's see if that works so
03:09 - I'm gonna have my yeah that looks pretty
03:11 - good I'll have my kind of the starting
03:13 - block where the scratch cat is gonna
03:15 - start and then here is kind of the maze
03:19 - this look good okay well let's put in
03:23 - another little block right there does it
03:25 - have to be complex no not really and
03:27 - level two will also have that similar
03:31 - gotta convert this back to vector and I
03:34 - will draw up my may so I'm going to
03:35 - pause the video right now because I'm
03:37 - gonna draw these elaborate levels and
03:40 - it's up to you to use your own
03:42 - imagination to make yours look amazing
03:44 - alright so I have added a whole bunch of
03:48 - backdrops let me just show you what
03:49 - you'll need for your game a starting
03:51 - screen which I haven't put the
03:53 - directions on there I will level 1 level
03:56 - 2 level 3 level 4 a game over screen and
04:00 - a you win screen all right well they're
04:04 - not screens they're costumes for the
04:06 - backdrop that sounds strange your
04:08 - backdrop has a costume ok so we're ready
04:11 - to start building this adventure game
04:14 - you've already built the backdrops now
04:17 - we're gonna add the characters the
04:19 - sprites that we're gonna use in this
04:20 - game and we need to add them all at the
04:23 - beginning because our code is gonna be
04:26 - so
04:26 - like woven together that this character
04:30 - this sprite really depends on the
04:33 - actions of this one to complete the game
04:37 - mind blown
04:39 - I know but let me show you how to do
04:40 - this go ahead and well we want the
04:43 - scratch cat but we want to name him
04:45 - something like cat well you don't have
04:47 - to use the scratch cat I am it's your
04:50 - choice
04:50 - then I'm gonna paint my next sprite as a
04:53 - door why because in our game we're gonna
04:56 - have these doors that you have to unlock
04:58 - to gets to the next level so let's paint
05:01 - a door using our door skills what color
05:04 - is mine gonna be I know no oh that blue
05:08 - is really cool looking blue door I'll
05:11 - make sure I put it in the center of the
05:12 - sprite right there and then I'll put a
05:15 - little doorknob on it which is gonna be
05:18 - black and you can be real creative with
05:21 - your door that's just what my door looks
05:23 - like and do I like the size of it well
05:25 - you can change the size maybe 75% there
05:29 - that's a good size for a door so we'll
05:31 - be using that sprite a lot in every
05:34 - level next I'm going to add well I'm not
05:38 - gonna paint my next one I'm gonna
05:39 - actually go into the library and I'm
05:42 - going to grab a monster
05:44 - I love monsters ooh this one's good
05:46 - Frank
05:47 - Frank don't hurt his feelings he's not
05:49 - really a monster he's a nice guy he just
05:53 - he just has a bad reputation anyways
05:56 - he's gonna be a monster in our game I'm
05:58 - wanting a little bit smaller there we go
06:00 - you can kind of size them up later we're
06:02 - gonna leave all the sprites showing cuz
06:04 - we're gonna hide them later
06:06 - in the next part okay so the cat the
06:09 - monster the door now we need a key key
06:14 - sprite now they have this cool key right
06:17 - here looks great
06:19 - but it's upside down I don't like that I
06:22 - want to go adjust it so go into the
06:24 - costumes for that sprite you can use the
06:27 - grabber to kind of grab the whole key
06:30 - and then you have this horizontal
06:33 - flipper you can flip it upside down
06:35 - whoops
06:36 - tonight yeah I got the whole key I'm
06:38 - gonna make it longer
06:39 - look at that all right so there's the
06:42 - key it's too big I want to make it like
06:44 - 50% of that size and now we're ready to
06:48 - work with the key it's not quite golden
06:51 - enough
06:52 - you notice that I want this key to be
06:54 - golden so I'll select the whole key and
06:57 - I'll go up to the fill section you know
06:59 - make it gold there it is oh pretty cool
07:05 - okay and anything else so we need oh
07:08 - yeah like apples or cherries or
07:10 - something to collect to give us points
07:12 - so let's see what kind of fruit we have
07:15 - apples there we go I don't know if they
07:17 - have apples in the Legend of Zelda but
07:19 - in my game we do and I'm gonna shrink
07:21 - the size using this size menu there we
07:24 - go so those are all the sprites that are
07:25 - gonna be in our game and we're ready to
07:28 - start coding now it's time to code our
07:31 - sprites what's gonna happen in the game
07:34 - this is the fun part let's start with
07:36 - the cat we're already on the you win
07:38 - screen you won no let's go ahead and
07:41 - click on the cat change his size to 50%
07:44 - because we want them kind of small in
07:45 - this zelda adventure game then click on
07:48 - the code and the first thing we usually
07:51 - do in the code is to deal with what
07:53 - happens exactly when the green flag is
07:56 - clicked and we're going to let have this
07:59 - position where the cats gonna be I'm
08:01 - gonna say go to 0 0 that will put him in
08:04 - the middle oh my goodness I got to get 0
08:07 - 0 how many zeros can I put there now
08:11 - he's in the middle now we're gonna do
08:13 - something super advanced we're going to
08:15 - make him hide and show hi didn't show
08:19 - that's not super advanced what if I did
08:22 - make it super advanced go on the looks
08:24 - menu and check this out set ghost effect
08:29 - to 100% goodbye cat this you win is in
08:36 - my in my way let's change the backdrop
08:39 - as well while we're here switch backdrop
08:42 - at the very beginning to start game
08:44 - there where's the cat
08:46 - he's a ghost how do you undo ghosts a
08:50 - fact I'll show you go to change and you
08:54 - want to hold I don't want to click
08:55 - together yet stop clicking together
08:57 - change ghost effect bye watch this
09:01 - negative one if I click on that like a
09:04 - hundred times there he is
09:07 - do you want the user to click on it a
09:10 - hundred times
09:11 - no you just use a repeat block go into
09:13 - control and use repeat block 100 times
09:19 - put that on here now start the game
09:21 - he'll be hidden and then he'll fade in
09:24 - isn't that cool
09:25 - yes but it can get better there's more
09:28 - folks let's also go into the looks and
09:31 - let's grab the set color and let's say
09:35 - set pixel eight this will be really fun
09:38 - pixel a to 100 now he's gonna be totally
09:42 - pixelated and then in our repeat we will
09:46 - unpick celatum set change pixelate by
09:51 - negative one oh this gonna be so fun
09:53 - here he is that is a thing of beauty and
09:58 - we haven't even started coding the cat
10:00 - we just kind of like made him up here
10:02 - but what a great way to start your game
10:05 - a professional touch now that we have
10:07 - that let's let's just leave it and let's
10:10 - go into all these other areas and of
10:13 - these other sprites and make them appear
10:15 - or not appear at the beginning so let's
10:18 - say the looks he will SH the door will
10:21 - be right here when the game starts so go
10:24 - to motion and here's the go to which has
10:27 - already set up with the right position
10:29 - and then this Apple we don't even want
10:32 - it to be showing at the beginning of the
10:34 - game do we we want it to be hidden so
10:37 - let's go looks hide where is the hide
10:41 - button there it is it is hidden and it's
10:44 - only gonna show itself when the next
10:45 - when you get to the next scene and good
10:48 - old Frank he's going to be hidden as
10:49 - well can't we just steal the Apple code
10:51 - there we go we'll just drag it when I
10:53 - drag it over it and he's shimmies that
10:55 - means it has been shared and I'm gonna
10:57 - oh no I need the key
10:59 - actually I do need the key because I
11:02 - want to in the very beginning I want to
11:04 - demonstrate how the key works so we'll
11:07 - say when the game starts you will see
11:10 - the key looks show the key show the key
11:15 - there we go so when I start the game you
11:16 - should see the door and the key and then
11:19 - scratch cat fade in all right we're off
11:21 - to a great start in the last video you
11:24 - added the hide in show and kind of the
11:27 - pixel a ghost effect on the scratch cat
11:30 - when he like appears isn't that magical
11:32 - I wish I could pixelate and no I don't
11:36 - that would probably it's like Star Trek
11:38 - or something beam me up Scotty so let's
11:41 - make it so the cat can move grab the key
11:43 - and unlock the door because that's the
11:45 - basic functionality so we'll go into the
11:48 - cat we don't really need to look at this
11:50 - code this is all the pixelate intro code
11:53 - so I'm gonna hide it for a second and
11:55 - I'm gonna add the basic movement to
11:57 - scratch cat which is gonna start with a
11:59 - wind start flag clicked I'm gonna make
12:02 - it so he follows the mouse pointer but
12:04 - I'm gonna show you a little bit of an
12:06 - advanced technique that I've been
12:08 - perfecting over the years and here it is
12:11 - I'm gonna use an if statement inside the
12:14 - forever loop and what I'm going to say
12:17 - is follow the mouse pointer so let's go
12:21 - to motion and we'll say where is that
12:24 - point towards mouse pointer and we'll
12:28 - use the move you've done this before
12:30 - look let's say move like three steps or
12:33 - five steps or something now this won't
12:35 - work because the if statement needs that
12:37 - condition that true or false condition
12:40 - and here's where I'm really proud of
12:43 - myself but I figured out that if you put
12:46 - a not touching mouse pointer in here it
12:50 - makes the movement a lot better not and
12:54 - then go to it's sensing touching mouse
12:59 - pointer now let me show you how this
13:01 - works
13:01 - starts the game look at that he fades in
13:05 - he follows the mouse pointer but if he
13:07 - touches the mouse pointer he doesn't
13:09 - move isn't that cool well what's the
13:11 - difference between that and the
13:13 - old way well if you don't have that if
13:14 - touching when he touches the mouse
13:17 - pointer he like shakes back and forth
13:19 - yeah not very professional and in this
13:22 - game we're trying to make everything
13:23 - really professional so this piece of
13:27 - code works really well but when he
13:29 - starts we want that fade in you don't
13:31 - really want him moving yet so let's put
13:33 - a delay before this code starts or even
13:38 - easier just attach this code to the
13:42 - bottom of the intro wow that's one large
13:46 - piece of code it's actually called a
13:48 - script yeah it's called a script when
13:50 - you add when you connect all the code
13:52 - blocks together we called those scripts
13:54 - so this is the complete code it should
13:57 - fade him in in the beginning and then
13:59 - follow he wasn't really pointing the
14:01 - right direction when he started we
14:02 - probably should add that point all these
14:05 - little nitpicky bugs you have to fix to
14:07 - get the code working correctly there
14:10 - there are you happy now when he starts
14:12 - he's facing to the right fades in and
14:14 - then after he fades in he follows the
14:16 - mouse pointer up next I want him to grab
14:20 - that key let's do that in the next video
14:24 - this is my favorite part of this game
14:28 - the key the scratch cats gonna get the
14:31 - key he's gonna put it in the door and
14:33 - unlock the next scene it's so cool but
14:36 - you got to make sure that the cat grabs
14:39 - the key only when the door is locked
14:41 - wait a minute did I just confuse you
14:43 - well let's slow down first of all the
14:46 - cat has to get the key and I want him to
14:48 - hold it in his hand like this if you
14:51 - just have the key as it is right now
14:53 - when you say go to cat it's going to go
14:56 - like that like it's in his mouth so I
14:58 - need to go into the costumes for the key
15:00 - and you'll see I've already done it I
15:02 - need to move the key to the right of the
15:05 - center and you could do that just by
15:07 - selecting the whole key and moving it to
15:09 - where you want so I want to put it right
15:10 - about there that will be perfect then go
15:13 - in the code and we want the key to start
15:15 - off well not him we want the key to
15:17 - start off right there so I'm gonna go to
15:21 - the code and say when the game starts go
15:24 - to that position
15:26 - perfect now if the cat touches the key
15:29 - then we want them to grab the key so
15:32 - let's go to control let's grab the if
15:34 - and then if touching so sensing if
15:38 - touching the cat go to that cat go to
15:45 - cat boom so this one should work
15:48 - perfectly but we need to wrap this in a
15:50 - forever loop yes and no I don't like to
15:56 - add a lot of forever loops because I
15:58 - feel that they lag the the game too many
16:02 - forever loops constantly running if
16:04 - they're hard to turn on and off in fact
16:06 - you can't turn off forever lips very
16:07 - easy at all without pushing the stop
16:10 - flag or doing the stop script I want to
16:12 - be able to put an off switch on this and
16:15 - that's why I'm gonna wrap this in a
16:17 - repeat until so go to control and look
16:21 - for repeat until now all we have to do
16:25 - is say well when do we repeat until well
16:27 - in tour till the door is uh unlocked
16:31 - locked unlocked how do we determine if
16:34 - the doors locked or unlocked we make a
16:37 - variable so go into variables and say
16:42 - make a variable and we say door is
16:45 - locked now in every other coding
16:48 - language you can't put a whole sentence
16:50 - as a variable but in scratch you can so
16:52 - let's just do that here it is door is
16:54 - locked is zero we're not gonna say zero
16:58 - we're gonna say true or false that's how
17:00 - we're gonna determine it so let's say at
17:02 - the beginning of the game we're going to
17:04 - set door is locked to true because it is
17:08 - locked there we go and as long as the
17:11 - door is locked you should be able to
17:13 - pick up the key so right in here I'm
17:16 - gonna go grab an operator and I'm gonna
17:19 - say if doors locked equals true then you
17:25 - can pick it up
17:26 - as soon as the door is not locked then
17:28 - you should be able to get rid of the key
17:29 - throw it away throw it away okay I need
17:32 - to get the variable right here doors
17:33 - locked I need to put that variable right
17:36 - there so go to variables grab doors
17:39 - locked and let's see if this thing works
17:42 - here it is he fades him he's going for
17:44 - the key and he's off like a race and it
17:47 - doesn't stick to him well why not let's
17:49 - go look at what's going on and repeat
17:52 - until door is locked equals true oh my
17:56 - goodness why didn't I think of that I'm
17:59 - repeating until this is true
18:01 - no I want to repeat until it is false oh
18:05 - my gosh so we need to cut the video or
18:07 - something no let's let's just say I made
18:10 - a mistake now it works perfectly I go
18:13 - and I touch the door so in the next
18:14 - video we need to make it so when he
18:16 - touches the door it goes to the next
18:18 - level awesome in the last video we
18:23 - showed you how to take the scratch cat
18:24 - pick up the key and go to the door
18:27 - we also made this variable called doors
18:29 - locked so we can kind of put in like an
18:31 - on and off switch on this forever loop
18:33 - it's called a repeat until which I love
18:36 - that type of loop okay so it works
18:39 - perfectly except for the door doesn't do
18:41 - anything well let's go code the door and
18:43 - what is the door gonna do well it's just
18:45 - gonna sit there till we open it so let's
18:48 - actually position it where we want to
18:50 - position it using the good old fashioned
18:52 - go-to good and then that door which is
18:55 - locked will be listening for when the
18:58 - key comes okay so let's go into control
19:01 - and let's say if it touches that key so
19:06 - we'll go to sensing touching key if it's
19:10 - touching key and then it will open the
19:14 - next level but we're gonna use messaging
19:16 - it's not really opening anything it's
19:18 - gonna fire an event that event is a
19:20 - broadcast message which we will name
19:23 - next level that's a perfect one all
19:27 - right but when is it gonna touch well
19:29 - it's gonna always be sensing for the key
19:31 - well always sensing well actually only
19:35 - if it's locked it's sensing so does that
19:38 - mean we need to take this if statement
19:40 - and nest it in another if statement yeah
19:45 - I think so okay so let's go and go to
19:48 - control
19:49 - and let's wrap it and then say if and
19:54 - we'll grab the operators if invariables
19:59 - door is locked equals now spell this
20:04 - correctly true if the door is locked
20:06 - then if the key is touching then
20:10 - broadcast next level and we need this to
20:15 - be a forever loop so since we're gonna
20:19 - wrap all of this in a forever loop let
20:21 - me just show you let me show you my my
20:24 - situation I should wrap this whole thing
20:26 - in a forever loop but I think I can
20:29 - actually simplify my code by using a
20:34 - repeat until repeat until door is locked
20:40 - false I'll get rid of this just use this
20:45 - piece of code put that in there
20:47 - this should work repeat until doors lock
20:50 - is false we're going to check for the
20:52 - key and then broadcast next level after
20:54 - we broadcast next level we probably want
20:58 - to relock the door so we'll grab my
21:01 - variables and say set door is locked to
21:07 - true basically I'm locking the door
21:11 - after myself now what is this broadcast
21:14 - next level going to do a couple things
21:16 - first it's going to make the cat go back
21:19 - to the beginning so let's do that
21:21 - go back to the cat here is his starter
21:24 - code and we'll want to go grab an event
21:28 - that says when I receive next level we
21:31 - want to do like basically all of these
21:34 - things so let's just duplicate that and
21:36 - we want all of that code except for this
21:41 - bottom part we don't want that movement
21:43 - code because we already have the
21:45 - movement code and it's still running
21:47 - over here also I want to probably speed
21:51 - up the ghost effect we can speed up the
21:54 - ghost effect by chasing this instead of
21:56 - repeating 100 we'll just have it repeat
21:58 - 10 and then we'll change it by negative
22:00 - 10 oops negative 10 and this button
22:04 - negative 10 that's just a preference for
22:06 - mine to speed up the how fast it pixel
22:09 - lights or unpick slates and instead of
22:12 - switching backdrop to start game we will
22:14 - go to next backdrop also the key will
22:18 - need to go back to the beginning so
22:20 - we'll say when I receive next level the
22:23 - key will need to go to the starting
22:27 - position or wherever you want it to go
22:29 - so let's just grab this motion and set
22:31 - it back there I think this door code is
22:34 - should work pretty well now let's try it
22:37 - out okay don't let me down cat grab the
22:40 - key go up to the door when it touches
22:43 - the door next level doors goes back to
22:47 - being locked and I have this game
22:50 - starting to look good there it is next
22:53 - level there we go now so far the game
22:57 - works really well but there's one major
23:00 - problem every time we get the next level
23:03 - message it switches to the next backdrop
23:06 - and let me show you it will switch to
23:08 - here switch to here switch to here and
23:09 - then it will go straight to the game
23:11 - over backdrop we don't want that we
23:14 - wanted to actually check what backdrop
23:17 - number it's on and then say hey you win
23:19 - you made it to the last one so let's go
23:22 - look in our stage menu at the backdrops
23:25 - and let's see how many backdrops we have
23:27 - we can count or you can just look on the
23:29 - left side 5 we have 5 levels and then
23:33 - the back the game over and the you win
23:35 - screen so just remember that number 5 so
23:38 - backdrop number 5 is our last level
23:40 - let's go in the code for the cat there
23:43 - so here's that when I receive next level
23:46 - I want to add an if statement right
23:48 - before it switches the backdrop so I'm
23:51 - going to separate it right here go into
23:53 - control grab that if statement now that
23:56 - if statement doesn't need a forever loop
23:58 - because it's only gonna run one time
24:01 - when this I receive next level it's
24:04 - gonna check what which backdrop you are
24:06 - looking at because that determines which
24:08 - level you're on let's go and grab the
24:11 - operator and it's going to be the equals
24:13 - operator because we're
24:14 - to check to see if the backdrop number
24:17 - is equal to five and you'll find the
24:19 - backdrop number in the looks menu at the
24:23 - very bottom it has this one backdrop
24:28 - number it's a reporter a block reporter
24:31 - blocks report the value so it's gonna
24:34 - report the backdrop number in this case
24:36 - you have a couple options of what it
24:38 - could report
24:39 - I prefer number because it's easy to
24:41 - remember the number then the name so now
24:43 - if it the backdrop number is five when
24:46 - when this next level script runs then
24:50 - it's going to send a message we'll go to
24:53 - events and we'll say broadcast not game
24:57 - over we're gonna make a new message and
24:59 - that's gonna say you win that's a
25:03 - message the message is you win after it
25:06 - broadcasts that message we don't want
25:08 - the rest of the script to run we want to
25:11 - exit this script so we'll go into
25:14 - control we'll scroll down till you see
25:16 - stop all we don't want to stop all we
25:19 - just want to stop this script there now
25:23 - it will work let's go ahead and start
25:24 - the game and let's click on this
25:26 - function to make it work we're going to
25:28 - the next backdrop next backdrop and it
25:31 - well actually it won't go past this
25:34 - backdrop right here because it keeps
25:37 - just broadcasting this you win so what's
25:40 - gonna happen when you win happens let's
25:43 - set up a like actually started coding
25:46 - something right here let me just throw
25:48 - it away let's say this when I receive
25:52 - where are they they're in the messages
25:54 - when I receive you win I want to hide I
26:01 - want to hide the cat show and hide there
26:04 - it is hide the cat there when I click on
26:07 - that or when I win it broadcast that
26:09 - message it will hide now I'll want to
26:12 - put this code on everything else as well
26:15 - because I want everything to hide when I
26:17 - win just like I want it to hide when I
26:20 - lose now don't forget you have to switch
26:24 - the backdrop to the you win screen so
26:26 - we'll go on the looks man
26:28 - you will grab the switch backdrop to
26:31 - start game we'll switch it to you win
26:34 - and then because we're hiding it I
26:36 - always want to make sure that I show
26:38 - this sprite at the beginning so go to
26:41 - looks grab the show and put it at the
26:44 - top of the code for the cat because even
26:47 - though we're setting the ghost effect to
26:49 - 100% it needs to be showing so that the
26:52 - ghost effect will work I know crazy all
26:55 - right that should work for you
