00:00 - it won't go it'll just slowly move
00:05 - across
00:05 - well maybe not slowly but it will move
00:07 - across the level in a more consistent
00:09 - manner a little slower a little better
00:23 - all right so we're in the qubit game
00:25 - again because it's the easiest 3d game
00:28 - to kind of show off some of this cool
00:29 - stuff and what I want to happen is I
00:32 - want this first platform to actually
00:34 - move across the level and go back and
00:36 - forth so it's a moving obstacle to avoid
00:39 - and there are like 700 different ways to
00:42 - do this in unity but the easiest way is
00:45 - just to create an animation but because
00:48 - we're creating an animation you will
00:49 - have to create a new animation for every
00:52 - single obstacle that you want to move
00:53 - because the ex-what and y-coordinates
00:56 - won't be the same for every object if
00:59 - you wanted it to be the same for every
01:00 - object you'd create empty game objects
01:02 - that were the start and end point and
01:03 - you could lurk between them or move
01:05 - between them or add a force back and
01:07 - forth when they collided like I said
01:09 - there's like 700 ways but we're gonna do
01:10 - the animation way today because I have a
01:13 - soft spot for animation lately all I
01:15 - mean you guys know that I've been doing
01:16 - animation like last like two weeks so I
01:20 - have my object selected here I'm going
01:22 - to choose the animation panel I'm going
01:24 - to create a new animation and I'm gonna
01:26 - call this one move across go ahead and
01:34 - save that to my assets and then I'm
01:35 - going to start recording and then I'm
01:38 - gonna just say so the starting point is
01:40 - here let's go ahead and make it take
01:42 - let's do one second so to get that
01:45 - timeline there that you saw that kind of
01:46 - like shrunk out so we could see more and
01:48 - more time I just zoomed out on the
01:51 - scroll scroll wheel so that changes the
01:53 - frame okay so let's go ahead and move it
01:55 - to the one-second mark and then I can
01:58 - change the position to the other side of
02:02 - the platform and now I have a keyframe
02:04 - that goes from one to the next if I go
02:07 - ahead and stop that recording and hit
02:10 - play we can see it moves across the
02:12 - screen now it moves across the screen
02:15 - but then restarts and goes back to the
02:18 - other side we wanted to move to the
02:20 - other side not teleport to the other
02:21 - side so let's go ahead and stop the
02:23 - playback I'm gonna move my playhead to
02:25 - that keyframe I'm gonna go ahead and hit
02:28 - record again and then I'm going to move
02:32 - it
02:32 - uh-uh-uh-uh-uh we can be fancier than
02:34 - that let's go ahead and stop the
02:36 - recording
02:36 - we're gonna take the this set of
02:38 - keyframes and we're gonna copy them I'm
02:41 - gonna do command C and then go to two
02:43 - seconds command V yeah okay so I just
02:48 - highlighted the first set of keyframes
02:50 - come and see your ctrl C to copy them
02:52 - and then paste them here so now when I
02:55 - play back the animation it bounces
02:59 - because it gets to that second set of
03:01 - keyframes and it's at the beginning
03:03 - position and then it starts the
03:04 - animation over all right now well let's
03:08 - play our game and see if that happened
03:10 - so I'm gonna go into my player here and
03:12 - I'm going to not allow it to move just
03:15 - so that we can don't get past it before
03:17 - it starts moving let's hit play let's
03:18 - see what happens and there we go we've
03:21 - got something that goes back and forth
03:23 - and moves across the platforms and you
03:26 - can do way more stuff with the animation
03:28 - here you can make it rotate you can make
03:30 - it pause on one side before it goes back
03:32 - to the next you could also slow down
03:34 - this animation so in order to slow down
03:37 - that animation what I can do is I can
03:38 - actually open up the animator itself
03:41 - that stores the path in which the
03:42 - animation happens click on the move
03:45 - across animation and there's a variable
03:47 - called speed and we can slow it down to
03:49 - like 0.5 and now it's going to go half
03:51 - as fast and now when we play our game
03:54 - it won't go it'll just slowly move
03:59 - across
03:59 - well maybe not slowly but it will move
04:01 - across the level in a more consistent
04:03 - manner a little slower a little better
04:07 - but it's up to you guys play with that
04:09 - play with the number of keyframes you
04:10 - put in there.put with all that stuff
04:12 - it's totally up to you but that's how
04:13 - you do a moving platform if you make a
04:15 - movie platform drop it in the comments I
04:17 - want to see your game I want to play it
04:19 - I want to fail at it and I will record a
04:21 - video be playing your game and failing
04:23 - at it and post it to the channel
