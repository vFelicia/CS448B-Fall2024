00:00 - all right i have a very basic clicker
00:02 - here but i want it so that
00:03 - they can only buy this 2x upgrade if
00:06 - they have a certain amount of points
00:08 - i don't want them to buy it and then go
00:09 - negative so i'm actually going to
00:11 - make so make it so that this button
00:13 - can't be clicked until you hit a certain
00:15 - score
00:16 - so most of that's going to happen in the
00:18 - code so let's dive on in there
00:20 - so i have the script here it's very
00:23 - similar to what the cookie clicker
00:24 - script
00:25 - is so if you haven't already done that
00:26 - make sure you build that out but the
00:28 - very first thing that i need to do
00:29 - is if i'm going to turn the button on
00:32 - and off
00:33 - i need to have a reference to that
00:35 - button i need to go
00:36 - grab that button so i'm going to grab
00:38 - i'm going to create a public variable
00:39 - you can make this private and then grab
00:41 - it in your start function but
00:42 - let's go ahead and just make it public
00:44 - for ease of use and it's going to be
00:46 - of type button because we're grabbing a
00:48 - ui button
00:50 - and let's call this buy to
00:54 - buy to x button
00:58 - okay cool so now that we have a
01:00 - reference to it in our code
01:02 - we need to go ahead and slot in the
01:03 - actual button that we want to hold there
01:07 - so in our editor my script is sitting on
01:10 - my canvas here
01:11 - so back in the editor my script is
01:13 - actually sitting on my canvas so i have
01:15 - my canvas selected
01:16 - and then down here i can see that by 2x
01:19 - button
01:20 - empty slot let's go ahead and slide our
01:22 - by 2x button
01:24 - right in there so now we actually have
01:27 - the button
01:28 - in our code save that head back to our
01:31 - script
01:32 - so now what i want to do is i need to
01:34 - keep track of what the score is at
01:36 - and then disable or enable the button
01:40 - based on the score so our update
01:42 - function runs continuously so this can
01:44 - track
01:45 - values really really easily so i'm going
01:47 - to go ahead and put in an if statement
01:51 - and then i'm going to in my conditional
01:53 - in the parameter that says whether or
01:55 - not this is true
01:56 - i'm going to say score is greater than
01:59 - or equal to 10. this says if the score
02:02 - is 10 or is higher than 10 do this stuff
02:06 - so between those curly brackets i'm
02:08 - going to do the stuff
02:10 - well what i'm going to do is i'm going
02:11 - to actually take that
02:14 - by 2x button dot enabled
02:17 - i'm going to set it to true and this
02:20 - says
02:21 - if the score is greater than 10 make it
02:23 - so that i can click on that button
02:25 - and then we'll go through and we'll just
02:27 - fire an else in here
02:29 - so that if the score happens to fall
02:31 - down below let's say you took away
02:33 - some score when they bought the upgrade
02:36 - huh there's an idea then we're going to
02:39 - go ahead and that buy 2x button
02:41 - dot enabled will then get switched back
02:45 - to false which means you can no longer
02:47 - click it if your score is below
02:49 - 10. now once you've bought this upgrade
02:51 - it's kind of permanent
02:53 - you're you're never going to get it
02:54 - lower than 2x upgrade now but
02:57 - this is good practice for coding now the
02:59 - other thing that we need to do
03:00 - is if you've paid attention here you
03:03 - will see that we never
03:05 - turned the button off when the game
03:07 - started so it's enabled
03:10 - until we say it's disabled so when the
03:12 - game starts
03:13 - we need to disable that button so we're
03:15 - going to do that by
03:17 - 2x button dot enabled i'm going to set
03:19 - that equal to false
03:20 - as soon as the game starts then enable
03:23 - it so if you want a button to be
03:25 - off by default make sure you put this
03:27 - enabled false
03:28 - in your start or your awake method let's
03:31 - go ahead and
03:32 - save that let's come back to the editor
03:35 - let's hit play here
03:38 - i can't click this button so you can see
03:40 - there's no impressions happening i
03:42 - clicked it
03:43 - a bunch of times and i still just go up
03:45 - by one
03:46 - still can't i'm at two still just goes
03:48 - up by one but if i get above 10
03:50 - i can then click that it upgrades it and
03:53 - now i count by twos
03:55 - so that's how to disable and enable a
03:57 - button
03:58 - based on a value of a variable hopefully
04:01 - that was helpful
04:02 - if not i don't know what to tell you i
04:04 - don't watch march
04:05 - watch mark rover on youtube i don't i
04:08 - don't know
