00:00 - hey I'm Matt and I'm going to be
00:01 - teaching you how to build a butterfly
00:03 - clicker game yes just like the famous
00:05 - cookie clicker game you click on
00:07 - butterflies to earn points let's get
00:10 - started we are building a brand new game
00:13 - so you need to find the create button at
00:15 - the top of the scratch home page this is
00:17 - the page you'll see when you start
00:18 - building a new game first you'll notice
00:21 - they give you a cat Sprite what's a
00:24 - Sprite it's the same thing as a
00:26 - character or an image in your video game
00:28 - now I don't need a cat Sprite in this
00:31 - game so I'm gonna delete that Sprite you
00:33 - can't delete the Sprite on the stage you
00:36 - have to come down to the Sprite menu and
00:38 - click the trash can button there now to
00:41 - add a new Sprite I'll hover over the cat
00:44 - head and I'll click it to choose a
00:46 - sprite from the library
00:48 - feel free to choose whichever Sprite
00:50 - you'd like but I'm going to choose a
00:51 - butterfly now to start your game in
00:53 - scratch you'll click the green flag at
00:56 - the top but you'll notice nothing
00:57 - happens you'll need to provide detailed
01:00 - instructions to all of the Sprites in
01:02 - your game we don't call them
01:04 - instructions we call that programming
01:07 - and we program it by adding code blocks
01:10 - to the code area let's practice adding
01:12 - some coding blocks to our game so we can
01:14 - just drag and drop and click them
01:17 - together and if we don't want them we
01:19 - can just disconnect them and throw them
01:21 - back in the pile let's throw them all
01:23 - back let's Dive Right In and code our
01:25 - butterfly clicker game the first block
01:28 - we need is an event block called when
01:31 - the green flag is clicked so here we go
01:33 - we'll drag that in now we want the
01:36 - butterfly to go to the center of the
01:38 - page that way when they finish playing
01:40 - wherever the butterfly is it will snap
01:43 - to the center so that's a motion block
01:45 - now there isn't a go-to center block
01:48 - talk but there is a go to X Y block and
01:52 - we can replace the x value with zero and
01:56 - the Y value with zero and that will be
01:58 - exactly in the center now let's test it
02:01 - yep it worked now that we have a
02:03 - starting script well you notice I use
02:05 - that word script anytime you have an
02:08 - event encoding blocks grouped together
02:10 - we call that a script let's add another
02:12 - event this one will say when the Sprite
02:16 - is clicked we'll have it go to a random
02:19 - position in the motion blocks there is a
02:21 - go to random position block so when I
02:24 - start the game now when I click the
02:26 - Sprite it goes to a random position now
02:29 - this is where you can get a little bit
02:31 - creative because you can go into the
02:33 - looks menu and you can actually have it
02:36 - change costumes what do I mean well if
02:39 - you go in the costumes tab you'll notice
02:40 - that this butterfly has different
02:42 - costumes I'll go back to the code Tab
02:45 - and you'll also notice that I can change
02:48 - size I can change color there are all
02:52 - sorts of different coding blocks that I
02:54 - can add to make my game more interesting
02:57 - and of course I can add a sound so I can
03:01 - say play Sound Pop
03:04 - what if I don't want it to pop can I
03:07 - choose different sounds yes I can record
03:09 - my own sound or I can go into the sounds
03:12 - Tab and add additional sounds available
03:15 - for this Sprite now you might have
03:17 - noticed I've added a bug to my code
03:19 - what's a bug well it's an unexpected
03:23 - Behavior see when my butterfly gets
03:25 - bigger every time I click on it that's
03:27 - great but when I restart the game The
03:30 - Butterfly is still huge I'll need to
03:33 - reset the butterfly's size in this
03:36 - starting script right here so I'll go to
03:38 - looks and I'll say set size to 100
03:42 - percent now this code will always run
03:45 - when the game starts so when I click the
03:48 - green flag now the butterfly is small
03:50 - again now so far this game is absolutely
03:53 - pointless did you get that one pointless
03:57 - so let's add some points now points are
04:01 - a value that can change in the game
04:03 - anything that can change is called a
04:05 - variable so click on the variables
04:08 - selector and click make a variable now
04:12 - you can actually name it anything you'd
04:13 - like but I'm going to call my variable
04:15 - points once you've clicked OK you'll
04:18 - notice that the value points or the
04:20 - variable points is now available when
04:23 - you click on it you'll see its value
04:25 - which it starts at zero you'll also see
04:28 - the value over here where it says points
04:31 - now I can make the points increase by
04:34 - changing them right here where it says
04:36 - change my variable I'll say when the
04:38 - Sprite is clicked change and there's a
04:41 - drop down points by one now when I click
04:45 - on my butterfly the points will increase
04:47 - in value by one our game is no longer
04:51 - pointless but it still doesn't have a
04:53 - goal games need to have a goal or a
04:57 - reason for playing them in our game we
04:59 - want the player to click the butterflies
05:02 - as many times as possible we can do this
05:06 - by adding an alert that offers
05:07 - encouragement like congratulations
05:09 - you've clicked the butterfly five times
05:12 - let's do that by adding another Sprite
05:14 - but this time we will paint the Sprite
05:17 - because we want to write text see the
05:19 - text tool right here we can write the
05:22 - words like congratulations or great job
05:25 - let's say Five Points I can select it
05:29 - and make it larger I can change the
05:32 - color
05:33 - there then I can position it on the game
05:37 - where I want it to show up now that I'm
05:39 - done drawing that Sprite I can switch
05:42 - out of the costumes tab into the code
05:44 - blocks Tab and you'll notice there's no
05:47 - code what happened to the code I wrote
05:49 - well that code is still there it's just
05:51 - in the butterflies coding area this
05:54 - Sprite the great job Sprite doesn't have
05:56 - any coding blocks so just like before
05:59 - I'll add an event that says when the
06:02 - game starts and the first thing I'll do
06:04 - is I'll say hide why because I don't
06:08 - want to see great job Five Points at the
06:10 - beginning so when I start the game it's
06:12 - gone now in order to show it I'll need
06:15 - the show block no duh okay so when do I
06:18 - want to show this Sprite well I want to
06:20 - wait until the points equal five okay so
06:24 - let's look for those coding blocks I
06:25 - said wait until that's in the control
06:28 - menu I'll scroll down until I see okay
06:31 - wait until that's kind of like a stop
06:33 - sign it's going to wait until something
06:35 - happens before it shows so wait until
06:39 - points so I'll go in variables and I'll
06:42 - grab the value for points
06:44 - now I can't put the value points in
06:46 - there I actually need to go and grab the
06:49 - operators because I said points equal
06:52 - something so points equal 5 then I'll
06:56 - put that inside of the wait until block
06:58 - there now once the wait a minute the
07:03 - points are already above five so this
07:06 - code won't work okay so hold on that's a
07:09 - bug I'll need to fix it so I'll need to
07:11 - go into variables and at the top of this
07:14 - code block I'll say
07:16 - set points to zero what that will do is
07:20 - reset the points at the beginning of the
07:22 - game now when I reach 5 Points that
07:26 - message will show up now do I want the
07:29 - message to stay there because now I'm
07:31 - already at 10. no I want it to disappear
07:34 - when well maybe after two seconds that
07:38 - sounds good we can do that in the
07:40 - control blocks as well we have a weight
07:43 - block
07:44 - let's say wait two seconds and then go
07:47 - back to looks and then hide
07:51 - all right that's a long script isn't it
07:53 - go ahead and try that and see if it
07:55 - works in your game now we have this
07:57 - message that alerts the player after
07:59 - five points but we want to add another
08:01 - alert that triggers at 10 points or 20
08:04 - points and that's easy to do all we have
08:06 - to do is duplicate this Sprite but
08:09 - before we do that let's name the Sprite
08:11 - because right now it's known as Sprite
08:13 - one and that might get confusing so I'm
08:16 - going to call this one alert
08:19 - 5 because it's going to alert after five
08:21 - points now that it's named I can right
08:24 - click on the Sprite and click duplicate
08:28 - this time I'm going to name it alert
08:32 - 10 and I'm going to go into the costumes
08:35 - for that Sprite and I'm going to change
08:37 - everything I need to change in order for
08:40 - it to be a 10 point message instead of
08:43 - the Five Point message and I'm going to
08:45 - change the color as well so it's a
08:48 - little bit different
08:49 - there now we have two different messages
08:52 - but they have the same exact code
08:54 - because when you duplicate a Sprite it
08:57 - also duplicates the code so I'll just go
08:59 - into the code and I'll change it so I'll
09:02 - wait until points equal 10 and then it
09:06 - will show itself so let's see if the
09:08 - game works now when it gets to five it
09:11 - should show great job Five Points and
09:14 - then when it gets to 10 great job 10
09:16 - points and we can continue duplicating
09:19 - and changing the code to encourage the
09:22 - player now that we have our basic game
09:24 - working we need to look for ways to
09:26 - improve the game well immediately I'm
09:29 - looking at this game and it's just a
09:31 - boring white backdrop so let's go to the
09:34 - stage menu and let's click this drop
09:37 - down to choose a backdrop
09:40 - I'm going to say this game takes place
09:43 - in the Arctic that's kind of funny I
09:46 - don't know about you but when I play a
09:47 - game and I don't hear sound effects and
09:49 - background music I think boring so let's
09:51 - add some sounds the butterfly does it
09:54 - plays The Sound Pop the alert 5 doesn't
09:56 - have a sound effect so let's go in the
09:58 - sound menu and let's say start sound now
10:01 - where do we want it to play right after
10:04 - they received Five Points then we play
10:06 - the sound pop that's the same thing the
10:09 - butterfly makes so let's either record
10:11 - something or let's go to the sound Tab
10:14 - and let's choose a sound in this case we
10:18 - want an effect sound I'm going to scroll
10:20 - down to where the win is alright that
10:23 - sounds cool so I select win now I'll go
10:26 - back into the code and I'll use the drop
10:28 - down to select when now just because I
10:31 - chose the wind sound for this Sprite
10:33 - doesn't mean it's available on the next
10:35 - Sprite see it's missing from this one so
10:38 - I'll need to do the exact same thing
10:40 - right here and now you should have a
10:43 - working game with sound effects
10:46 - congratulations you've finished the
10:48 - basic butterfly clicker now it's up to
10:50 - you to make improvements to make it more
10:53 - original more unique to your personality
10:55 - maybe you'll be sillier maybe be funnier
10:58 - scarier I don't know try it on your
11:00 - friends your family your teacher get
11:02 - ideas and make this game spectacular I
11:06 - can't wait to play your clicker game
