00:00 - so we can go to our game and we can see
00:02 - right here in the corner we can see our
00:03 - game
00:14 - all right let's make a mini-map now
00:16 - we're gonna make it in the simplest way
00:18 - possible and then we're gonna fancy it
00:20 - up towards the end so I have a game here
00:22 - created it's called azam tie with what
00:25 - we call it hacking ins but it's
00:26 - basically just the Unity third-person
00:28 - isometric shooter or orthographic sure
00:31 - there's kind of like a top-down
00:32 - third-person shooter the little kid a
00:34 - little toy doll that runs around and
00:35 - shoots other toy dolls on the ground but
00:38 - basically we're gonna make a mini map so
00:39 - the first thing that I'm gonna do is I'm
00:41 - gonna go ahead and create my mini map
00:43 - camera basically all a mini map is is
00:46 - just a camera that looks straight down
00:48 - on your level and then displays that out
00:50 - in the UI so I'm gonna go to my main
00:53 - camera here and I'm going to right click
00:55 - and create a new camera I'm also going
00:58 - to rename this camera too let's go mini
01:01 - cam now I'm going to change the
01:05 - perspective of this camera so it's more
01:07 - of a top-down now these numbers are
01:10 - going to work for me but they might not
01:11 - work exactly for your game your game
01:13 - might have a different starting point
01:15 - for the camera but you want to make sure
01:17 - your camera is looking straight down on
01:19 - your level so for me I'm going to change
01:21 - the rotation by 60 and then I'm going to
01:24 - change the Y to 36.7 and I'm going to
01:30 - change the Z to 7.4 that's just
01:33 - personally for this exact game those are
01:35 - the numbers I'm using yours are going to
01:37 - be different just position your camera
01:38 - so it looks straight down on your level
01:41 - even me I could configure this but I
01:43 - want to make it so that it's at least
01:44 - similar to the perspective that the
01:47 - player has now what we need to do is
01:49 - display this camera out to the UI the
01:53 - first thing that we're gonna do to do
01:54 - that is create what's called a render
01:55 - texture so in my assets panel here I'm
01:58 - going to right click create and choose
02:00 - render texture I'm going to call this
02:03 - mini texture but you can call it
02:09 - whatever you would like
02:09 - now this render texture has a bunch of
02:12 - settings over here we're not going to
02:13 - mess with any of them except for maybe
02:15 - this size if you wanted your texture to
02:17 - be a little bit more zoomed in or
02:18 - whatnot you can change this size up here
02:20 - but for us we're gonna leave it just
02:21 - like that
02:22 - now this mini cam
02:26 - a target texture right here and this
02:30 - takes in a render texture well we just
02:32 - created one of those so we're gonna drag
02:34 - that in and that what that does is it
02:36 - takes the display of the camera and
02:37 - renders it out to a texture
02:40 - well what takes a texture a raw image so
02:44 - in my UI here I have this HUD canvas
02:46 - thing I'm gonna go right-click UI and
02:48 - choose raw image this takes a image file
02:52 - of any type and then I'm gonna go ahead
02:54 - and zoom out here so I can see where I'm
02:56 - positioning that I'm gonna position mine
02:58 - in the lower right hand corner of my UI
03:02 - so if I switch to 2d mode I can see that
03:04 - it's down here on the right and I'm also
03:06 - just going to anchor that to the lower
03:08 - right hand side so as my window changes
03:10 - it always stays there
03:12 - alright so this raw image takes the
03:15 - texture what texture do you think we're
03:17 - gonna put in there that's right this
03:18 - mini render texture now our camera is
03:22 - actually displayed right there in the
03:23 - corner so we can go to our game and we
03:25 - can see right here in the corner we can
03:27 - see our game so if I hit play here we
03:29 - can see a tiny little dot over there
03:33 - that is our player running around the
03:35 - scene
