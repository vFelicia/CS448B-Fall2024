00:00 - if you build games on scratch then most
00:02 - likely you have points or a score system
00:05 - and if you want players to keep coming
00:07 - back to your game
00:08 - then you need to have a high score
00:10 - variable well
00:11 - how do you do that well you need to have
00:13 - access to cloud variables
00:16 - scratch only lets you create cloud
00:18 - variables if you are a
00:20 - scratcher how do you become a scratcher
00:23 - well you need to have at least two
00:24 - projects
00:25 - and you need to love and comment and
00:27 - favorite a couple other projects
00:29 - and have been using scratch for at least
00:31 - two weeks now let's look at this super
00:33 - basic game that i've created
00:35 - that has a score variable and the score
00:38 - increases when i press the space bar
00:40 - there so i'm at 10 clicks right now so
00:44 - my
00:44 - score is 10. well let's go ahead and
00:47 - create
00:48 - a cloud variable for the high score so
00:50 - click make a variable
00:52 - and this will be a cloud variable and
00:54 - we'll call it high
00:55 - score click ok now remember
00:59 - scratch only remembers numbers in cloud
01:02 - variables you can't do letters or any
01:04 - type of symbols at the beginning of the
01:06 - game we don't want to set the high score
01:08 - to zero because that will erase the old
01:11 - high score
01:12 - so what you want to do is say when the
01:14 - game starts
01:16 - set the high score to whatever value is
01:18 - sitting on the server
01:20 - and that's held right here and you can
01:22 - see the cloud symbol on it
01:24 - so we'll set high score to high score
01:26 - right now the high score doesn't have a
01:27 - value it's just
01:28 - zero because that's what all scratch
01:30 - values are when you start
01:33 - and we'll check now from now on we'll
01:36 - check to see if
01:37 - our score is higher than the high score
01:39 - so we'll need to go in operators
01:41 - and we'll get the greater than operator
01:43 - then we'll go
01:44 - back into variables and we'll say if
01:47 - my score is higher
01:51 - than the high score then
01:54 - we will set the high score
01:57 - to guess what my score was that
02:00 - confusing or what but it kind of makes
02:02 - sense right my score is greater than
02:04 - high score
02:05 - so set high score to my score
02:08 - i could say that a million times it'd be
02:10 - so fun okay so we need to put this
02:12 - inside of an if statement we'll say if
02:15 - if
02:15 - my score is greater than high score set
02:17 - high score to my score
02:19 - and then we need to put this anywhere
02:22 - well it will run and check and in this
02:25 - case we want it to check
02:27 - every time i press the spacebar okay so
02:30 - let's try it now
02:31 - oh wait a minute why is the high score
02:33 - going up
02:35 - because nobody's ever set the high score
02:38 - and in this case
02:40 - i'm setting the high score so now watch
02:42 - this i'm going to refresh the game
02:45 - my score is zero but the high score is
02:48 - still there
02:48 - and it won't actually change until i
02:52 - reach that amount again so that's how
02:54 - high scores work
02:56 - add high scores to your game or if
02:57 - you're not a scratcher hurry up and make
02:59 - some games
03:00 - i can't wait to see what you build
