00:00 - hey scratchers let's build flappy bird
00:02 - but don't call a flappy bird we might
00:03 - get sued let's say flappy bat cool we're
00:06 - cool with that so get rid of the scratch
00:08 - cat yes boom gone was there an explosion
00:11 - no now what we want to do is create a
00:13 - sprite and we're gonna be drawing that
00:16 - sprite that's gonna be those tubes that
00:18 - move across the screen which they're
00:20 - probably sued by Mario Brothers for or
00:22 - Nintendo okay and we're drawing the
00:24 - sprite grab the the square I don't know
00:26 - is it a square and we're gonna draw it
00:29 - it's a tube yeah is it dark enough
00:32 - probably like an outline would look good
00:34 - I don't know dark outline something
00:37 - there there's a tube let's draw the
00:40 - bottom of the tube now it doesn't look
00:42 - real fancy that's because you haven't
00:45 - shadowed it with a gradient or gradient
00:48 - with the I can't speak today go
00:50 - ahead and grab that bucket click on fill
00:52 - click on gradient then come over here
00:54 - and then you can adjust the gradient so
00:56 - it looks really cool oh but there's only
00:58 - one top tube why okay watch this copy
01:02 - copy and paste yes paste it and now you
01:06 - have two of them two of them that are
01:07 - exactly the same just flip it upside
01:09 - down I knew I'm doing a lot of stuff
01:11 - really quickly but I'm sure it's not
01:13 - that hard there's no room for that bird
01:15 - to get between there or bat or whatever
01:17 - it is so just go ahead and control how
01:20 - tall it is by changing that now it's
01:24 - pretty cool when you make multiple
01:25 - costumes so it's kind of one is hard one
01:28 - is easy
01:29 - whatever just right-click on it
01:31 - duplicate it duplicate it and each one
01:33 - of these go ahead and just adjust it a
01:35 - little bit more like this one's gonna be
01:37 - all the way at the top there you go and
01:40 - then this one's gonna be weight this
01:42 - one's here this one's here and this one
01:45 - is there looks pretty good to me let's
01:46 - go ahead and add the code and the first
01:49 - piece of code is going to be an event
01:50 - like you'll always do with a green flag
01:53 - there goes when the game starts we want
01:55 - this sprite to go to well right here
01:58 - right in the far right corner so let's
02:00 - put that sprite there that will save us
02:02 - some time when we go to the motions menu
02:04 - because then it will all be set up for
02:08 - us look at the go to position is already
02:09 - there exactly where we want it to be
02:12 - and now all we need to do is have it
02:14 - glide to the other side but let's
02:17 - manually move it to the other side put
02:19 - it where we want it to finish we want it
02:21 - to finish right there so now this glide
02:25 - is already set up with the correct
02:27 - numbers push the green flag
02:30 - oh it's impossibly fast so let's slow it
02:33 - down to what three seconds that looks
02:35 - good
02:35 - ah looks like flappy bird now each time
02:39 - it goes past we want it to switch
02:41 - costumes so go ahead and go looks and
02:43 - then do next costume and then wrap it
02:47 - all up with a bow and a forever loop
02:49 - because we want this pattern to repeat
02:51 - here it goes oh you got harder that was
02:57 - a little awkward looking hey works
02:59 - pretty well okay so now let's add our
03:02 - little fluffy bat it's going to be a
03:05 - sprite right so let's click on sprite
03:08 - Mitch you want to draw your own I'm not
03:09 - very good at drawing bats there's a bat
03:11 - woof let's just search for bats and
03:13 - let's see what our options are there's a
03:16 - that's that's a batter okay so here's
03:20 - the flappy bat and he's probably the
03:22 - wrong size so come on down into size and
03:24 - let's go for let's go for six hundred
03:27 - percent that's not gonna work
03:29 - still a little bit big let's go with
03:31 - fifty percent now we need to add the
03:34 - flapping motion of the bat and first of
03:38 - all we need to talk about what exactly
03:40 - will the bat be doing he will be falling
03:43 - and then you'll press the spacebar and
03:45 - he will flap flapping and falling just
03:49 - like a real bat does so let's go ahead
03:51 - and we'll start with a start flag and
03:54 - say okay where does he start let's have
03:56 - him start right here that way he'll have
03:59 - a chance to fall okay so we use the
04:00 - go-to and then we will go in the control
04:03 - menu and give will add some gravity to
04:07 - the game we'll say forever fall now the
04:09 - the Y position controls the up and down
04:13 - axis so if we say the Y is decreasing
04:16 - he'll go down and the Y increases he'll
04:18 - go up and I'll show you that right now
04:21 - inside the motion look for change
04:25 - here it is so if we change wife forever
04:27 - up he goes up if we change it forever
04:30 - negative ten
04:31 - he goes down let's see how fast that
04:34 - fall is that's a pretty fast fall I
04:37 - think for flappy bat my game it's gonna
04:39 - be a negative five fall that's pretty
04:42 - good point those tubes are really moving
04:45 - now
04:46 - to kind of counteract that gravity
04:48 - that's pulling him down I'm needing him
04:50 - to flap and flap hi he will so let's go
04:53 - ahead and add an event and let's say
04:56 - when the spacebar is pressed that he
04:59 - won't move up now I'll show you kind of
05:02 - the bad way and the good way to do this
05:04 - why am i showing you the bad way because
05:05 - it's easy watch this change Y by 10 this
05:08 - should just kind of counteract what I
05:11 - have right here not very well though
05:13 - because this is this forever loop is
05:15 - just fighting me it's too much to fight
05:18 - so let's go ahead and go inside of here
05:20 - and let's use a repeat block
05:23 - I love repeat blocks for jumping because
05:25 - it's gonna repeat ten times change by
05:28 - ten repeat blocks create a really smooth
05:31 - movement because instead of just doing
05:33 - the whole movement at once it's kind of
05:34 - repeat ten repeat ten repeat ten okay
05:38 - here we go let's see what it looks like
05:39 - now oh that looks a lot better we just
05:42 - it doesn't have the flappy motion we
05:44 - need the flappy motion so let's go look
05:47 - in the looks menu for the costumes and
05:50 - let's talk about what costume well what
05:53 - costumes do you have that you have you
05:55 - have a couple different ones oh I like
05:58 - that so I want it I want him when I
06:01 - press the spacebar to him to do bat a
06:04 - and then bat B that's pretty cool I like
06:08 - that okay so press the space bar switch
06:11 - costume to bat a and then after he let's
06:19 - see if this works
06:19 - to bat B let's check dot o it's reverse
06:24 - of what I wanted oh my goodness so let's
06:28 - say I want bat a and then there goes bat
06:32 - be there that's pretty nice I don't know
06:38 - why he's flying
06:39 - sideways but I love it now if he touches
06:41 - the the pipes which why are they there I
06:45 - don't know if he touches those pipes we
06:47 - want it to be kind of a game over
06:49 - situation so let's use a wait until
06:52 - block go into control and there is a
06:55 - wait until block so we're gonna say wait
06:57 - until touching those green blocks where
07:00 - pipes I keep saying blocks but they're
07:03 - pipes so let's go into sensing and
07:07 - touching now do I have to worry about
07:11 - what color let's just shrink the screen
07:12 - real quick what color these pipes are
07:15 - yes but actually they're a sprite
07:18 - they're called sprite one so I can
07:21 - actually sense those sprites here he
07:24 - goes
07:24 - so wait until touching sprite one and
07:27 - then and the game let's let's end the
07:31 - game the really super cheesy fast way
07:33 - because I'm trying to make this video
07:33 - fast let's just go into control and at
07:36 - the bottom just do stop all that's so
07:39 - cheesy I know so when are we going to
07:42 - actually use this code I don't like this
07:45 - type of code just sitting somewhere
07:47 - waiting to be discovered I want it to be
07:50 - at the top where I can see it easy and
07:52 - I'm gonna connect it to a starting flag
07:54 - there it is this game should work now
07:56 - let's play it alright everybody
07:58 - I'm oh is he
08:02 - we have a problem this tube is touching
08:06 - the bat and therefore it is not starting
08:08 - the game so let's go back to these tubes
08:10 - and make sure that they move to the
08:13 - starts to the starting position so let's
08:16 - move them all the way over here once
08:18 - again and go to motion and say go to
08:22 - this position when we start there no we
08:26 - can play this game ah it's so hard
08:29 - who made this get I'm gonna like rage
08:33 - quit right now yes yes
