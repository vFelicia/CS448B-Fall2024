00:01 - hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome
00:03 - to another tutorial with me in today's
00:06 - tutorial we are going to be learning
00:08 - about sorting
00:10 - arrays now let's start with the first s
00:14 - so the first one we have sort function
00:17 - which is ascending order
00:20 - alphabetically and then we have our SW
00:23 - which is descending order
00:26 - alphabetically let's go ahead and show
00:29 - you an example of these two so we will
00:32 - have our
00:35 - array and I'm just going to have random
00:38 - names like
00:41 - app um
00:46 - June
00:49 - KCK
00:51 - and
00:54 - [Music]
00:57 - basketball now we are going to have the
00:59 - sort
01:01 - function and let's put our array
01:04 - variable there and we are also going to
01:08 - count our array length so gals to
01:15 - count
01:17 - and and for this we are going to do a
01:20 - for
01:24 - Loop a =
01:26 - z a is less than
01:31 - G and
01:36 - A++
01:42 - Echo no
01:45 - Echo and the name was
01:48 - D and then we have
01:51 - a so let's go ahead and I'm already
01:54 - there so refresh and the items are in
01:58 - alphabetical order
02:01 - so at first it
02:03 - was Apple June kick the
02:06 - basketball now it's Apple basketball Dre
02:09 - then
02:10 - kick and then the second one is called
02:14 - AR sword which is descending order so
02:18 - it's still in alphabetical order but
02:20 - it's
02:22 - backwards so now it's k j basketball
02:27 - day and
02:31 - those are sort function and R sort now
02:36 - let's learn
02:37 - about assort and
02:40 - kort now the assort function is to sort
02:45 - associative arrays in the city order
02:48 - according to the value and K sort sorts
02:52 - associative arrays in a cic order
02:54 - according to the
02:56 - key so let's go ahead and begin
03:00 - those
03:02 - examples so have another
03:08 - one and I'm going to
03:11 - have
03:19 - [Music]
03:28 - s
03:45 - then we are going to have a
03:51 - sort have our
03:54 - varable then let's count the array
03:58 - Lane um just WR
04:01 - lals
04:02 - [Music]
04:05 - count and this is
04:09 - f sorry about that
04:12 - F and then we will do a four each Loop
04:15 - for
04:28 - this
04:33 - [Music]
04:51 - [Music]
04:58 - for
05:08 - favorite
05:10 - dot
05:12 - get and you're done with that control
05:18 - save and
05:21 - refresh so it's a alphabetical
05:25 - order
05:27 - but only because according to the
05:30 - value so according to the
05:33 - value this is how it's mined
05:38 - up now if we
05:40 - did the case work it will be according
05:45 - to the
05:47 - key so let's go ahead and do that one so
05:51 - Cas s save
05:53 - it and
05:55 - refresh and it changed so it's now
06:03 - red I forgot to put value
06:07 - here so save that and refresh again so
06:13 - name red favorite 14 all
06:18 - that so that is the assorts and
06:23 - kort now the last one we want to learn
06:26 - about is AR sort
06:29 - function which is sorting the associ
06:33 - arrays in descending order according to
06:37 - the
06:38 - value and then we have KR sort which
06:42 - sorts the associa Rays in the syore
06:46 - according to this the the key so we
06:51 - don't really have to do this over so
06:54 - I'll just change this to AR sort and
06:58 - save this and you will see what I'm
07:01 - talking
07:02 - about so now
07:05 - it's
07:06 - and a
07:09 - s so it's in descending order according
07:14 - to the
07:17 - value and then we have KR
07:23 - [Music]
07:28 - s
07:31 - refesh Sammy favorite 8 P Favorite 20
07:37 - and Fred favorite
07:41 - 14 and that is the KR swort in this head
07:45 - and this is in descending
07:48 - word so that is the different ways you
07:52 - sort or
07:55 - ra that's it for this tutorial thank you
07:58 - guys for watching
08:00 - and I will see you guys on the next
08:03 - tutorial

hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about sorting arrays now let's start with the first s so the first one we have sort function which is ascending order alphabetically and then we have our SW which is descending order alphabetically let's go ahead and show you an example of these two so we will have our array and I'm just going to have random names like app um June KCK and basketball now we are going to have the sort function and let's put our array variable there and we are also going to count our array length so gals to count and and for this we are going to do a for Loop a = z a is less than G and A++ Echo no Echo and the name was D and then we have a so let's go ahead and I'm already there so refresh and the items are in alphabetical order so at first it was Apple June kick the basketball now it's Apple basketball Dre then kick and then the second one is called AR sword which is descending order so it's still in alphabetical order but it's backwards so now it's k j basketball day and those are sort function and R sort now let's learn about assort and kort now the assort function is to sort associative arrays in the city order according to the value and K sort sorts associative arrays in a cic order according to the key so let's go ahead and begin those examples so have another one and I'm going to have s then we are going to have a sort have our varable then let's count the array Lane um just WR lals count and this is f sorry about that F and then we will do a four each Loop for this for favorite dot get and you're done with that control save and refresh so it's a alphabetical order but only because according to the value so according to the value this is how it's mined up now if we did the case work it will be according to the key so let's go ahead and do that one so Cas s save it and refresh and it changed so it's now red I forgot to put value here so save that and refresh again so name red favorite 14 all that so that is the assorts and kort now the last one we want to learn about is AR sort function which is sorting the associ arrays in descending order according to the value and then we have KR sort which sorts the associa Rays in the syore according to this the the key so we don't really have to do this over so I'll just change this to AR sort and save this and you will see what I'm talking about so now it's and a s so it's in descending order according to the value and then we have KR s refesh Sammy favorite 8 P Favorite 20 and Fred favorite 14 and that is the KR swort in this head and this is in descending word so that is the different ways you sort or ra that's it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
