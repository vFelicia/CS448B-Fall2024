00:00 - hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome
00:03 - to another tutorial with me in today's
00:06 - tutorial we will be learning how to
00:09 - upload files in
00:10 - PHP so let's begin the first thing we
00:14 - want to do is make sure that we can
00:17 - upload files in PHP so to check for that
00:21 - we'll go to your
00:23 - file
00:26 - open and you will go to the window seat
00:31 - and the exact
00:34 - folder and you will also look for PHP
00:41 - folder then you will search for a file
00:45 - named PHP i n
00:48 - i and mine is right
00:50 - [Music]
00:52 - here okay so what you want to search for
00:56 - is something that says file upload
01:00 - so I'm just going to click find next
01:04 - and exit this out and here it is so you
01:08 - want to make sure file uploads is equal
01:10 - to on if it's equal to off change that
01:13 - to on and you can go ahead and save that
01:16 - and just exit
01:19 - out so now we can begin what we need to
01:23 - do so the first thing you want to do is
01:25 - make a form in
01:28 - HTML so
01:31 - form action is equal to us.
01:37 - PHP method is equal to
01:42 - post and andc type is equal to
01:50 - multiart
01:51 - slash
01:54 - form
01:55 - [Music]
01:57 - data now the um ENC type basically tells
02:03 - us that this form is only to upload
02:08 - files so now let's do our first input
02:12 - type equal to
02:16 - file the name of this input will be
02:20 - upload
02:22 - me and then our last input will be input
02:27 - type equal to
02:33 - submit name equal to
02:39 - submit and the
02:42 - value is equal
02:45 - to I put something like
02:47 - [Music]
02:49 - upload and you are done with that so
02:52 - let's just save that and now let's go go
02:56 - over to our us. PHP page where the form
03:00 - is going to be checked so the first
03:04 - thing want to do is
03:08 - if is
03:12 - [Music]
03:17 - that so if the form is
03:20 - submitted we want to make a couple of
03:23 - variables so the first variable
03:27 - is f and f f is going to equal to the
03:32 - directory where the file is going to be
03:35 - placed in this case it's going to be
03:38 - place in a folder called images that I
03:41 - will be making later
03:43 - on and then let's have another variable
03:48 - where it specifies the path of a file to
03:51 - be uploaded so I'm just going to put
03:54 - where equal
03:57 - to where is equal to F do base
04:02 - [Music]
04:05 - name
04:09 - files this is going to be
04:15 - name and this is going to be
04:18 - upload
04:21 - me so it takes the input name and then
04:26 - it takes the
04:28 - name
04:30 - so and then we're going to have another
04:33 - variable image type and this is going to
04:37 - hold the file
04:39 - extensions so we're going to have path
04:45 - info going to have the variable
04:49 - where and then we're going to have PA
04:57 - info
04:58 - extension
05:04 - and then now the last variable we're
05:07 - going to have is get image and this one
05:12 - is going to get the image
05:17 - size that the user
05:20 - uploads so inside here we're going to
05:23 - have
05:28 - files
05:32 - tnp
05:33 - name stands for
05:36 - temporary and upload
05:43 - me now let's go ahead and make an if
05:48 - statement
05:52 - if get
05:55 - image is not equal to box so this is
06:00 - basically saying if the image is a real
06:06 - image
06:09 - and image
06:12 - type is equal to
06:16 - p
06:18 - n so we want to make sure that the file
06:21 - is a PNG
06:24 - file then we want to say not file
06:31 - [Music]
06:32 - exist variable
06:34 - where so the F the file do not exist
06:39 - that's what it basically mean so if all
06:42 - of that is true we want to go ahead and
06:45 - move uploaded
06:51 - [Music]
06:56 - file TMP name
07:03 - and upload
07:08 - me and then we're going to go ahead and
07:13 - head over to another page where it's
07:17 - going to
07:22 - stay where is going to say your imag is
07:26 - uploaded so I'm going to make a new page
07:30 - get me there
07:34 - PHP so we're going to make that also
07:37 - later
07:39 - on then let's
07:43 - make a
07:45 - little error
07:47 - message so if the get
07:53 - image is equal to false so if the User
07:57 - submitted a file and it's not an image
08:01 - then we're going to go ahead and
08:02 - [Music]
08:03 - Echo that is not an
08:10 - image else
08:13 - [Music]
08:15 - if let's say that the image
08:21 - side is not equal to PNG file I'm going
08:27 - to
08:28 - Echo
08:29 - [Music]
08:31 - that is not a
08:38 - supported
08:41 - file else
08:47 - if let's say the
08:51 - um let's say the image already exist so
08:55 - we're going to go ahead and write
08:57 - file exist
09:00 - [Music]
09:06 - where want to go ahead and
09:09 - Echo that image
09:14 - already
09:17 - [Music]
09:20 - exist so now we can go ahead and save
09:23 - that so let's go make our folder images
09:28 - let's go to file
09:32 - open and we're just going to click on
09:35 - new
09:36 - folder and I'm going to write
09:41 - images and for now our folder has
09:46 - nothing in
09:48 - it so go ahead and cancel
09:51 - that and we're also going to make our
09:54 - get me there. PHP page some new
10:01 - file save as get me
10:06 - there
10:09 - PHP so if everything is okay then we're
10:13 - just going to
10:15 - write
10:18 - Echo image has
10:23 - been
10:27 - uploaded so save that and now we are
10:30 - ready to test this out so first let's go
10:34 - over to local host.
10:41 - PHP and now we can go ahead and choose a
10:45 - file so let's say I do not choose a file
10:49 - I'm just going to go ahead and
10:55 - upload and we have an airor message on
10:58 - 97
11:04 - [Music]
11:07 - okay
11:09 - okay okay so I forgot to put the end so
11:12 - let's go ahead and refresh this again
11:15 - and it should work this
11:18 - time and it says that is not an
11:22 - image so we have this warning message if
11:25 - you see this warning message just go
11:28 - back to your
11:29 - code and where it says get image size in
11:34 - front of it you just want to add the at
11:37 - sign and save
11:39 - that and when we
11:42 - refresh that should go
11:45 - away so it says that is not an
11:50 - image so now let's go back
11:54 - to
11:56 - [Music]
11:58 - to.php
12:03 - and this time let's go ahead and choose
12:06 - our
12:08 - file so I'm just going to choose a file
12:12 - I'm going to go to
12:15 - pictures and I'm just going to choose
12:17 - this picture right here and as you can
12:20 - see it's a JPEG
12:25 - file so when we upload it it says that
12:29 - is not a supported
12:31 - file so now we want to go back to our
12:35 - local hust t. PHP just one second cuz I
12:40 - know I forgot something oh yeah you have
12:43 - to do a comma and add
12:46 - where save that and now let's go back to
12:51 - our Local
12:52 - Host
12:58 - tphp
13:00 - and this time we are going to choose a
13:04 - PNG
13:06 - file so this happens to be a PNG file
13:10 - and it's a image so we're going to
13:16 - upload and it now says image has been
13:20 - uploaded so if we go over
13:23 - to images our images folder our photo
13:28 - has been
13:30 - uploaded and we can go ahead and add
13:33 - more PNG files if we want to and you
13:36 - also can have let's say you didn't want
13:40 - any PNG files you can go ahead and use
13:43 - JPEG files or drift files or any files
13:46 - type that you will only
13:49 - want so that is it for this tutorial
13:53 - thank you guys for watching and I will
