00:00 - hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome
00:03 - to another tutorial with me and in
00:06 - today's tutorial we will be learning
00:08 - about conditional statements so
00:12 - conditional statements they are you to
00:14 - perform different actions based on
00:16 - different conditions so I have written
00:21 - down the following conditional
00:22 - statements that are used in PHP so the
00:29 - first one we have is called hip
00:31 - statement and this statement executes
00:35 - code if the condition is true and let me
00:40 - show you an example of that one so we
00:44 - have the world if we have our
00:48 - parentheses and then we have our curly
00:50 - brackets then press ENTER and then our
00:54 - condition rolls these who need of a
00:58 - parenthesis so I'm just going to have a
01:02 - condition like 20 is equal to 40 m so
01:14 - this condition is supposed to be true
01:17 - and if it is true icon true that true
01:25 - and that now save that and let's go
01:30 - ahead and head over to our set that PHP
01:33 - I'm already there so I'm just going to
01:36 - refresh and it says true and that
01:41 - because that is true for t is equal to
01:45 - 40 so the next conditional statement and
01:51 - if-else statement and this one basically
01:56 - execute the code if the condition is
01:58 - true but if it's not it will execute
02:02 - another code let me show you what I mean
02:07 - and
02:12 - okay let me change is so fitting and
02:20 - we're right else you have our Clowney
02:23 - package and then by the other condition
02:26 - I made the other yeah that's the close
02:30 - of yep um actually what it is and now
02:34 - that is totally wrong and asked about
02:44 - talking me wrong totally wrong and you
02:54 - see no that is totally wrong because the
02:58 - condition is not true and if the
03:01 - condition is not true it goes to the
03:04 - second cold and currents that out
03:07 - instead now the third conditional
03:14 - statement is if else if and else
03:18 - statement this one execute different
03:22 - clothes for more than one statement now
03:27 - let me head over and tell you one time
03:29 - out so let me just erase this i'm going
03:33 - to start over so i have it if and for
03:39 - the first condition i have um 30 is
03:45 - equal to mmm 3 fo just yes and then i
03:57 - have else if another condition are 30 is
04:05 - equal to 80 ever hmm yeah you're right
04:21 - I say yeah you're tight yeah you right
04:25 - and then else if neither the condition
04:31 - is true then it will echo arm no and
04:39 - save that and let's go ahead and refresh
04:43 - and the answer is no because neither of
04:48 - the condition are true 30 is not equal
04:51 - to 3 and 30th x equal to 80 so is skip
04:57 - these two arm hold to be executed and
05:02 - equal to write to this one which is
05:06 - temple love and that is how the if else
05:10 - if ml statement and you can have as many
05:15 - all else estate as you want else if 30
05:25 - is greater than 10 iphone yes ma'am save
05:36 - that and we get yes ma'am because one of
05:42 - the condition is true and that is this
05:46 - one the study is greater than sin so
05:50 - that's it for that one now let's learn
05:54 - about the switch statement this one
05:58 - selects one of many blocks of code to be
06:01 - executed now let me show you an example
06:05 - for that one so let's say I have a
06:09 - variable that holds my favorite color my
06:15 - favorite color is red well it's not
06:18 - asking me that but I'm just make it up
06:21 - so then I start the switch statement mr.
06:25 - switch parenthesis and honey buckets and
06:30 - then my condition we will hear
06:33 - so I'll just have my bearable and
06:36 - basically what happened is it's going to
06:39 - go through a block of holes so see which
06:43 - one matches the arm the color red that's
06:49 - in the variable favorite so you will
06:52 - start with case 0 at home your favorite
07:04 - favorite color is red and then there's
07:11 - something called break and then we went
07:17 - to another case run echo your favorite
07:25 - color color is food FN will break again
07:37 - and we will have another case case to
07:44 - equal your favorite color is yellow and
07:56 - then we will have something called
07:59 - default now default will only run if
08:06 - they cannot find a match for the color
08:11 - red that's in a variable favorite so
08:14 - it's going to go to all these cases and
08:18 - one of them is going to have to match um
08:21 - red so I just want to move this one but
08:27 - let's have a default discuss iphone i do
08:32 - not know your favorite color
08:44 - so if it cannot find the match where my
08:50 - favorite color red then it's just going
08:54 - to echo I do not know your favorite
08:57 - color so say this that thunderstorm and
09:03 - then refresh and your favorite color is
09:08 - red so if picked case 0 because k0 has
09:16 - the color red and it and that is how the
09:23 - switch statement basically goes so
09:30 - that's it for this tutorial I have
09:32 - taught you about the different
09:35 - conditional statements in PHP so I will
09:39 - see you guys on the next tutorial and it
09:43 - is going to be exciting thank you guys
09:46 - for watching and I'll see you on the
09:48 - next tutorial

hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me and in today's tutorial we will be learning about conditional statements so conditional statements they are you to perform different actions based on different conditions so I have written down the following conditional statements that are used in PHP so the first one we have is called hip statement and this statement executes code if the condition is true and let me show you an example of that one so we have the world if we have our parentheses and then we have our curly brackets then press ENTER and then our condition rolls these who need of a parenthesis so I'm just going to have a condition like 20 is equal to 40 m so this condition is supposed to be true and if it is true icon true that true and that now save that and let's go ahead and head over to our set that PHP I'm already there so I'm just going to refresh and it says true and that because that is true for t is equal to 40 so the next conditional statement and ifelse statement and this one basically execute the code if the condition is true but if it's not it will execute another code let me show you what I mean and okay let me change is so fitting and we're right else you have our Clowney package and then by the other condition I made the other yeah that's the close of yep um actually what it is and now that is totally wrong and asked about talking me wrong totally wrong and you see no that is totally wrong because the condition is not true and if the condition is not true it goes to the second cold and currents that out instead now the third conditional statement is if else if and else statement this one execute different clothes for more than one statement now let me head over and tell you one time out so let me just erase this i'm going to start over so i have it if and for the first condition i have um 30 is equal to mmm 3 fo just yes and then i have else if another condition are 30 is equal to 80 ever hmm yeah you're right I say yeah you're tight yeah you right and then else if neither the condition is true then it will echo arm no and save that and let's go ahead and refresh and the answer is no because neither of the condition are true 30 is not equal to 3 and 30th x equal to 80 so is skip these two arm hold to be executed and equal to write to this one which is temple love and that is how the if else if ml statement and you can have as many all else estate as you want else if 30 is greater than 10 iphone yes ma'am save that and we get yes ma'am because one of the condition is true and that is this one the study is greater than sin so that's it for that one now let's learn about the switch statement this one selects one of many blocks of code to be executed now let me show you an example for that one so let's say I have a variable that holds my favorite color my favorite color is red well it's not asking me that but I'm just make it up so then I start the switch statement mr. switch parenthesis and honey buckets and then my condition we will hear so I'll just have my bearable and basically what happened is it's going to go through a block of holes so see which one matches the arm the color red that's in the variable favorite so you will start with case 0 at home your favorite favorite color is red and then there's something called break and then we went to another case run echo your favorite color color is food FN will break again and we will have another case case to equal your favorite color is yellow and then we will have something called default now default will only run if they cannot find a match for the color red that's in a variable favorite so it's going to go to all these cases and one of them is going to have to match um red so I just want to move this one but let's have a default discuss iphone i do not know your favorite color so if it cannot find the match where my favorite color red then it's just going to echo I do not know your favorite color so say this that thunderstorm and then refresh and your favorite color is red so if picked case 0 because k0 has the color red and it and that is how the switch statement basically goes so that's it for this tutorial I have taught you about the different conditional statements in PHP so I will see you guys on the next tutorial and it is going to be exciting thank you guys for watching and I'll see you on the next tutorial
