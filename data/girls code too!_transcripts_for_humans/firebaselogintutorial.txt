00:00 - what's up guys thanks for tuning in my
00:02 - name is Stephanie and today I'm going to
00:04 - show you how to log in with Firebase
00:08 - so the last tutorial we learned how to
00:10 - sign up and now we're going to learn how
00:12 - to log in
00:14 - first thing is first I want to go ahead
00:16 - and visit the main
00:18 - activity.java page
00:20 - this is where we created the
00:22 - functionality for the sign up
00:25 - now if you go ahead
00:28 - and click where it says Firebase
00:31 - database get instance
00:34 - Etc
00:36 - um you notice I put users for the child
00:40 - but usage is supposed to be our path
00:44 - so you have to write users
00:47 - here where it says get reference
00:50 - and then for the child we're actually
00:52 - going to have the ID for the user so
00:55 - every user has a unique ID
00:58 - so in order to create that Inspire base
01:01 - off dot get instance dot get current
01:05 - user
01:06 - dot get UI ID
01:09 - so now when we save
01:12 - um our information once we sign up this
01:15 - is how it's going to look on Firebase
01:18 - so as you can see I have two different
01:20 - users and they have their own ID
01:24 - we have Stephanie and we have John
01:28 - so
01:29 - next thing is
01:31 - um we're gonna go ahead and create our
01:32 - login
01:34 - um functionality
01:35 - I've already created the login design
01:37 - for you
01:39 - um I have the email and I have the
01:41 - password and I also have this create
01:44 - account
01:45 - text here so if you click on that it
01:49 - will bring you to
01:50 - the sign up page
01:53 - and then also once we finish logging in
01:56 - it's going to bring us to our profile
01:58 - page
01:59 - where we will have our name displayed
02:02 - our email our age and we will also have
02:07 - a sign out button
02:10 - so enough of the talking
