03:03 - learning how to create our table and so
03:07 - before I close off I can just go ahead
03:10 - and after that semicolon as I write my
03:14 - database name so DV is equal to my
03:19 - database which is my database name and
03:23 - that's all we have to do so now we can
03:28 - go ahead and learn how to create a table
