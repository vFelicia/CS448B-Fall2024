00:01 - hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome
00:04 - to another tutorial with me in today's
00:07 - tutorial we are going to be learning
00:09 - about error handling in
00:12 - PHP now whenever you are making a web
00:15 - application you always want to make sure
00:18 - you have um something that handles your
00:21 - airor message so let's go ahead and
00:25 - begin I'm going to show you three
00:27 - different ways I handle my error
00:29 - messages
00:31 - so let's talk about the custom error
00:36 - handing so in order to do that you do a
00:40 - function name the function whatever you
00:42 - like I'm going to name mine to my
00:46 - error and it
00:49 - takes two parameters and over here I
00:53 - have
00:54 - written the
00:56 - different parameters that it does take
01:00 - so it takes error level which is
01:02 - required error message which is
01:06 - required and error file error line and
01:09 - error context so the only ones we are
01:12 - using is error level and error
01:15 - message so let's go and yeah so it's
01:20 - going to take a variable ER R
01:24 - level and it's also going to take err
01:28 - message
01:31 - then I went to
01:35 - Echo
01:37 - eror
01:39 - detected and this function basically is
01:42 - going to handle our air message so this
01:47 - one is going to say ER
01:50 - message and the other one is going to
01:52 - say ER
01:55 - level now we are going to set our error
01:59 - head
02:00 - hand set e r r
02:09 - Handler and in this case I'm just going
02:11 - to let it get two
02:15 - parameters the first one is going to
02:19 - say
02:20 - my function name which is my
02:25 - error and the second PRI is going to
02:28 - take the ER reporting level and over
02:32 - here there are different error reporting
02:35 - levels um I'm just going to use one of
02:38 - them which is e user
02:41 - warning so let's go ahead and do that so
02:44 - we're going to use e user
02:48 - [Music]
02:51 - warning then I'm going to make an a
02:54 - message well I'm going to test this out
02:58 - so I want to know if the file
03:06 - this so I want to know if p.
03:10 - PHP
03:14 - exists if it does
03:16 - Echo
03:18 - true
03:23 - else we will go ahead and Echo not Echo
03:26 - but we'll go ahead and Trigger
03:32 - error and we'll say
03:35 - no and
03:38 - comma e user warning so let's save
03:45 - that and let's go to Local Host t.
03:53 - PHP and we get error detected 512 no
04:01 - now we can also use different air
04:04 - reporting levels we can use let's use e
04:09 - user notice instead of e user
04:12 - [Music]
04:19 - [Music]
04:21 - warning save
04:24 - that
04:26 - refresh and we again error detected
04:28 - 10249
04:31 - now so that's how the custom eror
04:35 - Handler
04:36 - works
04:38 - now let say I
04:42 - was
04:44 - if
04:46 - I exist
04:49 - [Music]
05:00 - [Music]
05:02 - else
05:05 - um
05:09 - no so in this case we can use the D
05:12 - function to handle our
05:14 - error and let's go ahead and
05:17 - refresh and we get
05:21 - no and then the other one what you saw
05:24 - earlier was called trigger
05:26 - error and this one goes like this
05:32 - refresh and you get notice no and see
05:37 - EXA hd. PHP online 5 so it's basically
05:42 - telling us that the file does not
05:46 - exist and that is the three different
05:49 - ways I handle my error
05:52 - message so thank you guys for watching
05:55 - and I will see you guys on the next
05:58 - tutorial

hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about error handling in PHP now whenever you are making a web application you always want to make sure you have um something that handles your airor message so let's go ahead and begin I'm going to show you three different ways I handle my error messages so let's talk about the custom error handing so in order to do that you do a function name the function whatever you like I'm going to name mine to my error and it takes two parameters and over here I have written the different parameters that it does take so it takes error level which is required error message which is required and error file error line and error context so the only ones we are using is error level and error message so let's go and yeah so it's going to take a variable ER R level and it's also going to take err message then I went to Echo eror detected and this function basically is going to handle our air message so this one is going to say ER message and the other one is going to say ER level now we are going to set our error head hand set e r r Handler and in this case I'm just going to let it get two parameters the first one is going to say my function name which is my error and the second PRI is going to take the ER reporting level and over here there are different error reporting levels um I'm just going to use one of them which is e user warning so let's go ahead and do that so we're going to use e user warning then I'm going to make an a message well I'm going to test this out so I want to know if the file this so I want to know if p. PHP exists if it does Echo true else we will go ahead and Echo not Echo but we'll go ahead and Trigger error and we'll say no and comma e user warning so let's save that and let's go to Local Host t. PHP and we get error detected 512 no now we can also use different air reporting levels we can use let's use e user notice instead of e user warning save that refresh and we again error detected 10249 now so that's how the custom eror Handler works now let say I was if I exist else um no so in this case we can use the D function to handle our error and let's go ahead and refresh and we get no and then the other one what you saw earlier was called trigger error and this one goes like this refresh and you get notice no and see EXA hd. PHP online 5 so it's basically telling us that the file does not exist and that is the three different ways I handle my error message so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
