00:01 - hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome
00:03 - to another tutorial with me in today's
00:06 - tutorial we are going to be learning
00:08 - about two super globals in PHP we have
00:11 - the get and the post method now these
00:15 - two super globals are used to send
00:17 - information from a form now the
00:20 - difference between these two is that
00:23 - with the get method the information is
00:26 - visible to everyone but with the post
00:29 - method
00:30 - is not visible to anyone now let's go
00:34 - ahead and show you an example for this
00:36 - example I am going to make an HTML form
00:40 - please don't worry if you do not know
00:42 - about HTML forms I will be having
00:45 - tutorial for
00:48 - HTML now
00:53 - HTML
00:56 - body
00:58 - body and I'm just going to have my form
01:01 - tags
01:03 - form form for Action this is going to go
01:08 - to a page
01:11 - called us.
01:14 - PHP and the method is equal
01:19 - to
01:22 - yet now for this form I'm just going to
01:26 - have two inputs input size equals to
01:31 - [Music]
01:32 - text
01:35 - placeholder is equal to
01:40 - name
01:46 - name and the name of this input will be
01:53 - first then I'll have a second
01:56 - input type equals to
02:03 - text
02:05 - [Music]
02:09 - placeholder
02:11 - ID and for the name will be
02:17 - St then I will
02:20 - have a submit button type is equal to
02:28 - submit Val
02:30 - is equal
02:31 - to
02:35 - submit and the name of this button will
02:39 - be
02:44 - button
02:46 - now so we made our form now let's go and
02:50 - make our us. PHP page so let's save this
02:55 - and let's just go to
02:57 - file
02:58 - nail
03:00 - file
03:01 - again save as
03:05 - us.
03:08 - ehp now this is where the form is going
03:12 - to be submitted so let's have our PHP
03:18 - tag and we are going to say
03:24 - if is
03:28 - set
03:33 - not post but
03:38 - get and the form name I mean not form
03:41 - but the button name is
03:44 - button so basically if the form is
03:48 - submitted then I just want to
03:50 - Echo their name the name that they have
03:54 - so I'm going to say
03:57 - name space
04:03 - dot
04:07 - [Music]
04:08 - get
04:14 - name
04:16 - that
04:20 - [Music]
04:21 - dot we going to have break
04:25 - here another
04:28 - Dot
04:30 - and we're going to say
04:33 - ID space
04:37 - dot
04:47 - get and then we go check back to see
04:50 - okay so I had first and second as the
04:52 - name so I'll just put second
04:56 - here and I'll just put
05:00 - first
05:02 - here so let's go ahead and see an
05:06 - example of the get
05:08 - method so we already did our us. phv
05:12 - page and we did our
05:15 - form so let's go ahead and over
05:18 - and Local
05:21 - Host SL
05:24 - tphp so here's our form so we have to
05:28 - type in the name and I'm to type in my
05:31 - name and I'm just going to type in the
05:33 - ID like
05:36 - 12 and then I'm going go ahead and
05:39 - submit now when I have said that the get
05:42 - method your information is visible to
05:46 - everyone this is what I meant now if you
05:49 - look at the browser you'll see that your
05:54 - name is right there where my name is
05:56 - right there and my ID number number is
06:00 - right
06:01 - here so that is what the get method does
06:05 - the information is visible to
06:08 - everyone I wouldn't recommend for you to
06:11 - use the get method for your forms
06:16 - because you don't want to put sensitive
06:18 - information out
06:20 - there I would recommend you to use pulse
06:24 - now the pulse works like this so I'm
06:27 - just going to change this to
06:32 - post save that I'm going to go
06:36 - here and I'm going to do the same thing
06:39 - I'm going to change this into
06:43 - post change this into
06:47 - post
06:48 - and change this
06:51 - also so save
06:55 - that and
06:58 - refresh oops no not
07:01 - refresh but our
07:04 - local we got to go
07:06 - back t. PHP so now I'm going to put in
07:10 - my information
07:12 - Stephanie and the number is
07:14 - 12 so
07:16 - submit and there goes my name now the
07:20 - difference is that you don't see my
07:22 - information so it's not visible to
07:26 - anyone so that is the difference between
07:29 - the
07:29 - get and the post
07:35 - method so thank you guys for watching
07:38 - this tutorial and I will see you guys on
07:42 - the next tutorial
