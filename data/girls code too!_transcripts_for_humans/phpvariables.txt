00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to another
00:02 - tutorial with me and in today's tutorial
00:06 - we are going to be learning about
00:08 - variables in PHP a variable is basically
00:13 - a container for storing information in
00:18 - different languages variables are
00:21 - written differently so let's go ahead
00:25 - and see an example of a variable and to
00:30 - write a variable PHP you must start with
00:32 - a dollar sign the name of the variable
00:35 - and equal to a value or of screen and
00:40 - the value of the number and a string is
00:44 - a sequence of characters it's like a
00:48 - text stink of it out of texts now my
00:53 - variables you must start with a letter
00:58 - you cannot start with the number you
01:01 - cannot have nine is a number you can't
01:06 - have that you will encounter in air
01:08 - wrists and also I variables are case
01:15 - sensitive like say if I have a variable
01:19 - a and i have another variable a but
01:23 - isn't cat this is not a valid a valid
01:27 - variable now necessary we want this to
01:31 - equal the variable to NH string and the
01:38 - variable is going to hold a string that
01:40 - says hello world and we're also going to
01:50 - have a variable that holds a number so
01:58 - this is a stream and this is a value so
02:08 - now
02:08 - on the last tutorial we learn how to
02:12 - output data on the screen by using echo
02:19 - hello world now when we're using
02:27 - variables we can also equal what the
02:32 - variable is holding by staples holding
02:36 - extreme my name is Sam and we want to
02:44 - print it out my name is Sam on the
02:47 - screen instead of snake echo my name is
02:51 - Sam just say echo the variable here
02:56 - which shows the stream my name is sin
03:02 - and we save this and we will test this
03:07 - out localhost forward slash touch PHP
03:15 - enter and it says my name is Sam so the
03:24 - variable here holds the string my name
03:27 - is Sam and we just said fo the variable
03:31 - here which holds that string now this is
03:37 - some other examples let's add more
03:40 - strings more than one string here is
03:45 - equal to the number eight um hi is equal
03:52 - to the stream party and we'll have one
04:02 - more bearable and this rail will be
04:05 - called JJ equals to the value nine and
04:14 - that's say we wanted to find all of
04:18 - these out on the screen together how
04:21 - would we
04:22 - that so the only thing we need to do is
04:25 - to say fo the vulnerable here common the
04:33 - variable hi comma and the variable JJ
04:38 - and remember that you don't have to do
04:40 - it in this order they do it in any order
04:43 - you want to it doesn't matter and you
04:47 - will just save this and if we refresh
04:53 - our page you will see that 8 pi 9 is
04:59 - displayed on the screen now that is how
05:05 - you do a variable in PHP and it's just
05:12 - one more example oh let's have hairy
05:20 - equals to Potter fo let's just use print
05:30 - print Harry and we save that and refresh
05:42 - and Potter is this flame and that is how
05:48 - you do variables in PHP start with a
05:54 - dollar sign name the variable and equal
05:57 - it to either a value or the street and
06:00 - remember do not start it with the number
06:02 - if you do let's refresh this and as you
06:13 - can see the error message is parse error
06:16 - syntax error unexpected 9 expecting
06:21 - variable or dollar sign and see example
06:28 - htdocs studies p on line two so you do
06:35 - not
06:35 - encountered this error so and that is it
06:42 - for today and this is how you know
06:46 - variables in PHP so on the next tutorial
06:49 - I will be teaching you about different
06:52 - data types in PHP thank you guys for
06:55 - watching and I will be looking forward
07:00 - to making more videos for you about PHP
07:03 - thank you and goodbye
