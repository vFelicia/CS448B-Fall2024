00:00 - hi everyone this is stephanie and
00:03 - welcome to another tutorial with me and
00:06 - today's tutorial we will be learning how
00:09 - to login on user using PHP and MySQL I
00:14 - so let's begin the first thing is first
00:18 - I have already have everything set up
00:21 - for you
00:22 - I have the forum and HTML and the action
00:28 - is going to be this page which the forum
00:33 - is going to be submitted and the method
00:36 - is equal to post and the only thing we
00:39 - axe for is the email and we have the
00:44 - submit button so let me just go ahead
00:47 - and show you how this page looks and
00:51 - this is the page so we have this little
00:54 - inputs we have an Ashford and we have a
00:57 - button so Capisce got that part
01:02 - now so let's start the first thing we
01:06 - want to do is we're going to start our
01:09 - session and I'm just going to write a
01:18 - little comment here saying that we're
01:20 - about to do the login but next time we
01:27 - want to do is we want to require our
01:31 - connection page and if you have been
01:34 - watching my tutorials I have a new
01:39 - connect dot PHP page and this is our
01:42 - connection page now so I need to require
01:47 - that and that is me and connect dot PHP
01:54 - now we can go ahead and begin so the
02:00 - first thing I want to do is we want to
02:02 - make an if statement and we want to say
02:06 - if is that
02:10 - and we asked ourselves what is set if
02:13 - the submit button which is called log in
02:16 - if it's submitted what do we want to do
02:22 - so just go ahead and put logging and now
02:28 - so if the form is submitted
02:31 - what do we want to do the first thing we
02:35 - want to do is we want to select from our
02:37 - table so select everything from me the
02:46 - table where the email is equal to dot
02:54 - dot post email so whatever the user
03:04 - inputs want to select that email from
03:08 - the table now the next thing we want to
03:12 - do is we want to make another variable
03:14 - and I'm going to call this SQL q equal
03:18 - to MySQL I query and it's one to take
03:26 - the connect variable which is from the
03:28 - new connect dot PHP and it's going to
03:32 - take SQL Man 1 now we must go ahead and
03:39 - make another if statement and in this
03:44 - statement we want this to check if
03:47 - everything is true we want to check if
03:50 - the input email is not empty so not
04:00 - empty post email and my SQL I fetch
04:10 - Assoc SQL cue
04:19 - is greater than zero meaning that there
04:25 - is an email associated with that or in
04:31 - other words there is an email on the
04:34 - file that they post it and we also want
04:38 - to check that if they inputs an email
04:41 - that is a valid email so we write
04:44 - something like not filter bar and we
04:52 - write post email comma filter validate
05:04 - email not filter far the email those are
05:11 - valid a email and it's not equal to
05:14 - false so it's a valid email address so
05:19 - if all of this is true what do we want
05:23 - to do the first thing what to do is once
05:26 - I go ahead and make a session terrible
05:29 - and in order to do that session and you
05:35 - will name the session variable and I'm
05:38 - going to call it email I'll equal to
05:46 - post email and that is all we need and
05:56 - the next thing we want to do is we're
05:59 - going to write header and this is going
06:05 - to redirect us to another page so I'm
06:09 - going to make a new file they are on
06:11 - column you page dot PHP and after that
06:19 - something location and now for disco so
06:27 - now this part is finished
06:31 - so we checked we are checking if the
06:34 - input is my empty
06:37 - if the email that they do in place
06:39 - exists and that is not an invalid email
06:43 - address and if it's true they're going
06:47 - to start a session variable and it's
06:50 - going to redirect this to a new page dot
06:54 - PHP now the next thing what to do is we
06:58 - won't take an if statement and we're
07:01 - going to say if for some reason the
07:04 - input is empty what do we want to do
07:11 - then well we want to go ahead and make a
07:15 - vample a equal to the message that we
07:20 - want to display on the screen so I'm
07:23 - going to say please enter your email and
07:32 - I spell email Bron embarrassing and we
07:36 - want to say if that's not the problem
07:38 - else if let's say that the email does
07:46 - not exist so - - am i fetch and yes
07:51 - that's on Steam and it's so cute and
07:57 - this is not equal to one what it wants
08:03 - to do that same variable a is now going
08:07 - to equal to email does not think this
08:14 - and if that's not the problem the email
08:22 - might be a invalid email address and
08:25 - what do we want to do so I'm just going
08:27 - to copy this right here and I'm going to
08:34 - paste it over here and instead of false
08:38 - we're going to put true
08:41 - so if it's an invalid email then we will
08:47 - put a equal to and valid you know and
08:55 - now we are done with this heart so we
09:00 - are checking in this part if the input
09:03 - is empty throw the error message if it's
09:07 - an existing if it's not an existing
09:10 - email address then throw this error
09:13 - message and if it's not a valid email
09:16 - address then throw in this message now
09:19 - the only thing we want to do is number
09:23 - one we want to go in between our spam
09:27 - class after the attachment and we're
09:30 - going to add our PHP syntax and we're
09:34 - going to say echo live variable a so if
09:40 - you do in calcium in a message it will
09:43 - echo the message whatever your message
09:48 - it chooses and then now we can go ahead
09:52 - and state this page and now we also go
09:57 - back to our new connect dot PHP and we
10:01 - have to basically tell this page that
10:05 - we're going to have a variable named a
10:07 - and it's going to hold our error message
10:11 - so we have a venerable a equal to
10:14 - nothing so let's go ahead and save that
10:19 - now let's just go make our new file and
10:24 - this file is going to be save as new
10:28 - page dot PHP and all the change is going
10:35 - to do is equal the email address that
10:38 - they have login so we're going to do our
10:41 - PHP syntax and all we're going to do is
10:46 - start the session first
10:55 - required connect page Sonia connect dot
11:06 - PHP and now we're just going to go ahead
11:11 - and echo I'm going to echo something
11:16 - like hi space dot the session bird will
11:24 - mean that we had created and we called
11:29 - it email on bio and that is all we have
11:37 - to do for now
11:40 - we're completely done so that's going to
11:43 - happen to save this and now we can go to
11:48 - our nil me dot PHP page and now I'm just
11:55 - going to refresh this page and now we
12:00 - can begin to log in so the first thing
12:02 - that I'm going to show you is I am NOT
12:06 - going to into anything and I'm just
12:08 - going to submit the button so let's go
12:12 - ahead and do that and we get a message
12:15 - please into your email now let me enter
12:19 - something but it's not a valid email so
12:23 - I'm just going to put something like
12:26 - that and login so it says you have those
12:31 - not exist and that is not the message
12:33 - it's supposed to say so what do we do
12:39 - wrong okay guys here's a problem um this
12:45 - is kind of weird but we have to
12:48 - rearrange this so let me just go ahead
