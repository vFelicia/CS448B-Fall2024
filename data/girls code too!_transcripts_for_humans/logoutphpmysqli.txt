00:43 - PHP but in HTML and this how you make
00:46 - mix in HTML and this link is going to go
00:53 - to um if hey that I made already called
00:59 - new log outs hot PHP and we want to go
01:04 - ahead and change this to single quotes
01:07 - since we are ready using on double cold
01:10 - and now i'm just going to write
01:12 - something like logout and i also want to
01:16 - break this because you know just let
01:22 - some space yeah one space okay and
01:28 - that's it so that is it for that page
01:32 - just go ahead fo make a link in HTML and
01:38 - this link is going to go to New locked
01:41 - out dot PHP okay so go ahead and save
01:48 - that and now we will go to that page
01:52 - that file that we mate new now got PHP
01:55 - and we're just going to make a PHP tag
02:01 - and the first thing is first we're going
02:05 - to start the session
02:09 - and then we're going to destroy the
02:16 - session and then we're going to unset
02:23 - discussion so session start session
02:28 - destroying and session I'm set so you
02:32 - must start the session before you
02:34 - destroy it and before you learn to set
02:36 - it okay and now we're just going to make
02:40 - a header tag well not a header tag but a
02:43 - header function and after the session
02:48 - has destroyed and upset and stuff like
02:50 - that we want it to go ahead and redirect
02:53 - us to aur main page which is new me dot
03:01 - PHP and that is what you want ok so now
03:08 - we are finish and now let's go ahead and
03:13 - test the style so I'm going to go ahead
03:17 - and login and as you can see i am not in
03:32 - now let's say I no longer know to be
03:35 - honest page I'm going to leave the page
03:38 - so I'm going to go ahead and log out so
03:42 - click the link log out and it brings me
03:49 - back to New me dot PHP now i'm going to
03:53 - said we're finish but we are not quite
03:56 - done yet now if we go ahead and let's
04:02 - say we want it to go back to that new
04:04 - page doc needs me right and as you can
04:13 - see it gives us a notice saying
04:15 - undefined index name so it's basically
04:19 - saying that there's no username you did
04:21 - not enter username
04:23 - and you just came back on this page and
04:25 - it still says hi and then you have a log
04:28 - out page I'm either like that we now you
04:32 - do not what this to happen if the user
04:35 - is not logged in then they should not go
04:38 - to go to this page so in order to
04:41 - prevent that we will do something like
04:44 - this so go back to new page dot PHP and
04:48 - underneath here I'm just going to make
04:51 - an if statement and I'm going to say if
04:55 - not session name now what do I want to
05:05 - do header location new me PHP so what am
05:19 - I saying if the user is not logged in
05:23 - then they need to be right redirected to
05:28 - the main page so all I said if not
05:32 - session name then have them back to New
05:37 - me dot PHP now we are done so go ahead
05:41 - and save it and now all I'm going to do
05:46 - is refresh this page and watch what it
05:49 - does it sends me back to New me dot PHP
05:54 - so let me do this one more time new page
05:59 - that PHP and there you go so I am unable
06:05 - to access that page unless i am logged
06:08 - in M that is all we need to know for the
06:14 - logo so thank you guys for watching hope
06:18 - you guys um learn how to log out and I
06:23 - believe that this is the last tutorial
06:24 - for PHP and MySQL I I will be moving on
06:30 - some HTML I probably should have started
06:33 - teaching HTML first before I started
06:37 - HP but it doesn't matter so um I hope
