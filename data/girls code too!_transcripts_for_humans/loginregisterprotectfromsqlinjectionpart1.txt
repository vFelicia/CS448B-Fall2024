00:00 - hi everyone this is stephanie and
00:03 - welcome back to another tutorial if you
00:05 - in to dance Astoria we will be going
00:09 - over protecting our data from PhD a -
00:13 - karai so we monsoon is tech our database
00:18 - protect myself with SQL injections
00:22 - so I'm elastic tutorials I taught you
00:26 - guys how to log in and how to register
00:29 - but
00:31 - but what that but but I did not do it um
00:36 - safely yes that's how you log in but and
00:40 - that was safest way to log in or
00:42 - register because as of now our site with
00:46 - very vulnerable and our site can either
00:50 - leave behind
00:52 - the Hydra canyons from the database
00:55 - destroy the database into many many
00:58 - damages to your website so and this is
01:02 - for you I am going to show you how to
01:04 - protect did that okay so before I do
01:09 - that I just want to show you an example
01:11 - of what you might
01:13 - expect whenever they are hacking your
01:17 - website so I made a simple form it acts
01:21 - with a username and a password for the
01:23 - login and thank me for the registration
01:27 - now as you know if we put something like
01:31 - this and we could have big password it
01:34 - will automatically tell us that the
01:37 - account has not exist right but if I
01:41 - must a hacker which I'm not will hacker
01:44 - thank God things or something like or
01:48 - single quotes for one - hi and then they
01:54 - will go ahead and copy that and paste
01:56 - that for the password as well at this
02:00 - time where they press the button they
02:03 - will be
02:04 - transformed transfer to your Facebook
02:06 - page and it will say hi whatever they
02:10 - type it or Warren - -
02:13 - so it's just coming off like you have
02:16 - count then they do not have an account
02:19 - so they can easily log in and
02:23 - that is the problem and also there are
02:26 - other examples where they can access
02:29 - somebody
02:30 - inflammation and they'll change to my
02:33 - information steals money information and
02:36 - stuff like that so we must have go ahead
02:39 - and
02:41 - he bet that happening so let's look at
02:45 - to our file and
02:47 - we'll just want to make a couple of
02:49 - changes replace everything and you'll
02:52 - see what I'm doing so the first thing is
02:56 - arm
02:57 - versus select remembers where user a was
03:00 - equal to post mutiny we're going to
03:03 - delete the post need to me with stuff
03:06 - like that I don't want to replace a
03:08 - little question
03:11 - and we will do the same thing for our
03:13 - past
03:15 - replacing with the question
03:18 - now the next thing we want to do is over
03:22 - here why sql-like query we want to
03:25 - change that so my SQL eye cream there
03:30 - okay so we're words who move take care
03:34 - statements
03:37 - now next time was the if the same
03:41 - powerful as
03:44 - - arrow
03:47 - and a voice you Suffolk are buying
03:51 - Turan and
03:54 - the vine quorum function is telling us
03:58 - that we always find in finality and
04:01 - you're going to tell the database what
04:04 - forever there is bearable to do so it
04:07 - takes three parameters for now
04:11 - so so the first parameter it is going to
04:14 - take armed what type of data
04:18 - when you want
04:20 - the MySQL takes that in this case where
04:25 - we have username and password so both of
04:27 - them are streams so we're watching this
04:31 - two S's but I'm just using one might
04:35 - username alone there we'll just use one
04:38 - s and as you know there are different
04:40 - data site by integer e so if we're using
04:44 - an integer values I
04:46 - before using double leaving is B and
04:50 - implement using a bomb the l.l.bean
04:55 - maybe use the letter B
04:58 - so in this case we are using two streets
05:01 - so SS
05:03 - now comma and we are going to have a
05:07 - variable called
05:10 - a you but I want to make after
05:15 - we're done with this and my wife's make
05:18 - another bear will P so the variable a us
05:22 - for some hold our input for the username
05:25 - and the PE is for the past
05:29 - so let's go ahead and do that so a Mew
05:33 - is Point C equal to post
05:38 - here's our name
05:41 - and
05:43 - same thing for the password equals pulse
05:50 - past
05:53 - you
05:55 - and that's all Denise to pick up now the
05:58 - next thing the last thing I want to do
06:00 - is
06:01 - take that variable s s and you will set
06:04 - X to it
06:05 - so execute
06:08 - and
06:11 - now another thing what to do is go
06:14 - together replace the empty post username
06:18 - with a you
06:21 - same thing for password
06:27 - te and
06:29 - instead of saying my ask when I fetch
06:32 - Assoc they will stay the bamboo SS
06:39 - fetch
06:40 - [Music]
06:43 - and if it's greater than sea
06:46 - and we replaced this with a
06:50 - bearable age
06:52 - [Music]
06:59 - now and we'll do the same thing with
07:03 - this right here
07:04 - hey you
07:07 - and
07:09 - same thing for this right here
07:14 - and with PE
07:17 - and we'll also
07:20 - change the spike here
07:24 - so
07:27 - okay yeah
07:30 - you know um
07:34 - fetch
07:35 - [Music]
07:37 - sometimes all we did and that is all we
07:41 - need to do or right now well I think
07:44 - we're done so that makes me so you
07:47 - almost have what I did so instead of
07:49 - saying select everything remember the
07:52 - username is equal to post there's a name
07:55 - of stuff like that we
07:57 - substitute it with the question one and
08:00 - then instead of using - for like 30 we
08:03 - use - all right you care then we run the
08:07 - parameters and then we made two
08:11 - variables to hold our inputs name and
08:15 - then we execute and then when we faced
08:18 - everything that the variables au and PE
08:21 - and then instead of my sqli match Assoc
08:28 - we use the variable s test and it's
08:31 - going to stretch the arm
08:33 - the table get parameters so that is all
08:38 - we did now let's go ahead and save it
08:40 - and now I'm going to show you the
08:42 - difference between
08:44 - how he logged in with the
08:48 - single folds or on it and I tonight so
08:53 - this time we're going to try to log in
08:55 - with the same thing yet
08:59 - [Music]
09:01 - hopefully no errors and we don't have
09:05 - any errors so now is this accountant of
09:07 - negatives so that strength that they use
09:10 - it cannot be its own so you must have an
09:14 - account and in this case I don't have an
09:17 - account well I have multiple accounts so
09:20 - I'm just going to log in with Stephanie
09:22 - rocks and my password
09:25 - Stephanie frost and the password is
09:29 - password
09:30 - and this time this is hi Stefan ruff so
09:36 - I'm not in some remember the hacker
09:39 - cannot log in with that trick negative I
09:42 - mean person Egham be Singapore or one
09:46 - pipe night they cannot do that
09:50 - so that is it for me laughing on the
09:53 - next tutorial we will be arms only the
09:56 - registration this similar is the same
09:59 - thing but you will be going over that so
10:03 - thank you guys for watching and I will
10:05 - see you guys on the next tutorial bye
