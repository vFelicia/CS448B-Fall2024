00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to another
00:03 - tutorial with me on the last tutorial we
00:07 - learned about different data types that
00:08 - variables can store
00:10 - and what the different data types are
00:12 - able to do
00:13 - I left out one data type because I
00:15 - wanted to do a special video for that
00:17 - one and that data type was object object
00:21 - is a data type which stores data and
00:24 - information
00:26 - in order to process that data it must be
00:29 - declared
00:32 - so let me go ahead and show you what I
00:35 - need
00:36 - so
00:38 - you're going to have a keyword called
00:41 - class
00:42 - the class is basically a structure that
00:45 - contains properties and awesome methods
00:49 - someone to name my class ice cream
00:54 - crony brackets
00:57 - and I'm going to have something called a
00:59 - function
01:00 - don't worry if you do not know what a
01:03 - function is we will learn this on later
01:06 - tutorials
01:07 - so function I'm going to name my
01:09 - function the same thing as my class
01:14 - and
01:17 - then I'm going to have a special
01:19 - variable called this
01:23 - and
01:24 - basically this right here
01:28 - means that it's going to address
01:32 - function or the property of our class
01:35 - so type
01:37 - um
01:38 - type of ice cream that I want is
01:41 - chocolates
01:45 - and
01:46 - now we are going to create
01:51 - our object
01:55 - let's create our object we're going to
01:57 - have a variable
01:58 - called here
02:00 - and here's one to equal to new I
02:05 - because we are making a variable called
02:07 - ice cream we have a class named ice
02:10 - cream unfortunately
02:12 - so in
02:16 - now we are going to show
02:19 - our object so
02:25 - I can go ahead
02:27 - Echo
02:29 - are of our variable here
02:33 - and it's high so it's basically going to
02:37 - print out the type
02:40 - um ice cream
02:42 - which is chocolate
02:44 - and save this
02:47 - and let's head over to our hello
02:50 - everyone co-host and welcome to another
02:52 - tutorial forward slash team on the last
02:55 - tutorial we learned about different data
02:57 - types that variables can store
02:59 - and what the different data types are
03:01 - able to do
03:02 - and that's not one data type so I wanted
03:05 - to do a special video
03:06 - and that data type was object images
03:16 - chocolate must be declared
03:20 - so let me go over this so one more time
03:22 - let me go ahead and so basically I've
03:24 - made a class named ice cream so we have
03:26 - a functioning ice cream you're going to
03:28 - have a camera I have a circle named this
03:31 - yeah
03:34 - contains properties and the time is
03:37 - equal to Chocolate so and then we create
03:39 - this objects on here and it creates
03:44 - ice cream
03:47 - ice cream don't worry if you do not know
03:51 - what a function is foreign
03:59 - [Music]
04:12 - and
04:13 - basically this right here
04:17 - means that it's going to address
04:21 - our function or the property of our
04:24 - class
04:25 - so type
04:27 - um
04:27 - type of ice cream that I want is
04:30 - chocolates
04:34 - and
04:36 - now we are going to create
04:40 - our object
04:44 - and to create our object we're going to
04:46 - have a variable
04:48 - uh here
04:49 - and here is going to equal to new ice
04:54 - because we are making a variable called
04:56 - ice cream
04:57 - we have a class name ice cream and
04:59 - functioning ice cream so in
05:06 - now we are going to show
05:09 - our object show
05:14 - and go ahead
05:16 - Echo
05:18 - are of our variable here
05:22 - and it's high so it's basically going to
05:26 - print out the type
05:29 - um ice cream
05:32 - which is chocolate
05:33 - and save this
05:36 - and let's head over to our
05:39 - localhost
05:42 - forward slash t u c dot PHP
05:52 - and it's loading
05:55 - loading loading loading
05:58 - let me just refresh this okay and here
06:03 - is the type of ice cream
06:05 - which is chocolate
06:09 - so let me go over this one more time so
06:12 - basically we've made a class named ice
06:14 - cream
06:15 - we have a function named ice ring
06:18 - and we have a variable name this which
06:21 - is referring to the class
06:24 - and the type is equal to chocolate
06:27 - and then we create an object which is
06:30 - called here and it creates our object
06:33 - ice cream
06:34 - and then we Echo the type of eye string
06:38 - which is chocolate
06:41 - now on the next tutorial I will be
06:44 - teaching you about something called
06:46 - functions
06:48 - and
06:50 - we'll go from there so thank you guys
06:53 - for watching and I will see you guys on
06:56 - the next tutorial thank you bye
