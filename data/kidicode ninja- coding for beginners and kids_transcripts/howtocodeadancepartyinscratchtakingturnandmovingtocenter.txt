00:08 - hey
00:13 - do you like to learn how to make this
00:17 - let's see welcome to kitty code ninja
00:20 - tutorials
00:21 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:24 - learn to code and have fun
00:25 - hello everyone welcome to another
00:28 - tutorial
00:29 - in this tutorial we are going to see how
00:32 - we can have a really big dance party
00:35 - we will see how we can take turn when we
00:38 - have a lot of people on the floor
00:41 - we will invite each other in the middle
00:43 - of the dance floor
00:44 - and take turns while dancing did you
00:47 - watch the dance feeds party last week
00:50 - if no i put the link below so that you
00:53 - can go
00:53 - and watch it on your own time if not
00:57 - it's not a problem you can join us in
00:59 - this tutorial
01:00 - we will start everything from the
01:03 - scratch
01:04 - and we will code in scratch let's dive
01:06 - in
01:07 - all right in order to create this dance
01:10 - body
01:11 - we need to follow five simple steps
01:14 - and then we need to write it in a
01:16 - language that computer can understand so
01:20 - there are three main steps which
01:23 - are number one go to the center of dance
01:26 - floor and then so we tell the sprite to
01:29 - go to the center of dance floor
01:31 - and dance then we need to tell the
01:34 - sprite to send the message to the next
01:36 - dancer to come to the stage
01:39 - and third one we need to tell the stride
01:42 - to go to a side and let the next dancer
01:45 - come in
01:46 - these three steps are the main
01:49 - steps that are operating the whole dance
01:53 - scenario and then there are two more
01:56 - which is playing a dance music
01:58 - and setting the backdrop and changing
02:00 - the lighting effects
02:02 - which are basically to make it more
02:04 - exciting
02:06 - let's go and see how we can write it
02:09 - in the language of computer
02:13 - alright let's see how we can tell the
02:14 - computer to do these things
02:16 - first we go to scratch.mit.edu
02:22 - and then i click create
02:34 - i delete this cat because i don't need
02:35 - it i'm gonna
02:37 - import three sprites which are my
02:39 - dancers
02:41 - so i click here
02:44 - i choose the dance category
02:48 - then i can choose as many dancers as i
02:51 - want or i can import
02:53 - more dancers from my own computer
02:58 - i choose this one
03:04 - and also
03:12 - i choose the sprite of myself in order
03:16 - to see how you can have the sprite of
03:18 - yourself
03:19 - watch my previous video the link is in
03:22 - the description
03:23 - you don't have to use your own sprite
03:26 - but it's even more fun to have your own
03:30 - sprite on the dance stage
03:33 - all right so i import mine
03:41 - and let's have one more you can import
03:45 - as many dancers
03:46 - as i want in this video i'm showing with
03:49 - three
03:53 - i need to make sure that every sprite
03:56 - has various
03:57 - costumes because each costume
04:00 - is going to be used as a dance pose so
04:04 - this one has which is good
04:08 - this one should have as well and then
04:12 - the one that i imported i'm gonna add
04:14 - more costumes to it
04:16 - so i choose it i go to the costume tab
04:19 - and from here
04:22 - not here back
04:26 - back back
04:36 - i'm gonna choose more customs
04:39 - by uploading from my computer
04:44 - so i upload all the
04:47 - dance poses that i have here
04:53 - all right now we have three
04:56 - sprites with three dance poses now it's
05:00 - time to tell them
05:01 - first dance
05:08 - okay
05:12 - let's start with this one
05:17 - the code for writing the dance is
05:20 - first of all we need to trigger the
05:23 - start button
05:24 - so
05:27 - let's say this sprite is going to
05:30 - start the dancing every first
05:34 - action should be started by when start
05:37 - clicked
05:40 - so i go to the event so i drag when
05:43 - start clicked
05:47 - repeat maybe
05:52 - five times and then i go to the looks
05:59 - change to the next costume
06:03 - by this code this character
06:06 - goes from one costume to another costume
06:09 - five times so it should look like as
06:12 - it's dancing
06:13 - let's see
06:16 - it does but it's so fast so in order to
06:19 - make it more like a dance
06:21 - we go to the control and add
06:25 - some weight in between poses
06:29 - weight zero
06:34 - 0.3 seconds let's test it
06:39 - it's good
06:43 - all right we said that the second step
06:48 - is that each dancer is calling
06:51 - another dancer to the center of the
06:54 - dance floor
06:56 - so let's see how we can do it
07:00 - let's give each character a name so that
07:03 - we can
07:04 - call them juvie
07:08 - okay let's say
07:12 - this one is judy
07:17 - let's call this guy
07:23 - alex and then
07:28 - ellie all right
07:33 - now
07:37 - this one is dancing and then he's going
07:40 - to call
07:40 - another one for calling there is
07:43 - something
07:44 - on the events which is called broadcast
07:48 - so
07:49 - broadcast message one which is calling
07:52 - the other
07:52 - dancer
07:56 - i'm going to broadcast and then
07:59 - i'm creating a new message from here
08:05 - which i say
08:11 - judy's turn
08:18 - okay so broadcast judy's turn
08:25 - so this dancer is dancing five times
08:29 - and then calling the other one so i go
08:32 - to judy
08:35 - and then i say when
08:39 - i receive judy's turn
08:44 - now it's time to for this one to test
08:47 - when i receive judy's turn
08:54 - repeat so the same code for the dance is
08:58 - from the control
09:04 - repeat five times
09:09 - go to the next costume
09:12 - and then i need a bit of weight in
09:13 - between to slow down the changes of the
09:17 - moves
09:20 - wait wait wait
09:24 - it should go inside
09:30 - so when i receive judy's turn i repeat
09:33 - five times next costume and i wait
09:36 - let's run it and see what happens so
09:39 - this one is dancing
09:42 - and then next one dances five times
09:51 - so one more thing we need to add is
09:55 - when alex called ellie
09:59 - ellie should receive it so
10:02 - again here we need to write similar code
10:05 - for eddie as well
10:07 - so i say when i receive
10:13 - ellie's turn
10:17 - again same as the other ones repeat
10:22 - five times or how many times do you like
10:27 - go to next costume
10:32 - a little weight in between
10:37 - and 0.3
10:41 - and then i'm gonna call judy
10:45 - again so from the events
10:49 - broadcast
10:53 - judy's turn
10:57 - now we should this
11:01 - three people should dance forever
11:02 - everyone is calling the next person
11:08 - all right
11:14 - one more thing we're gonna do is that we
11:17 - want
11:17 - every character every dancer that wants
11:20 - to dance
11:21 - go to the middle of the stage which is
11:25 - this place location zero zero zero we
11:28 - can see the location from here so if i
11:30 - say zero
11:31 - zero zero is where is the center of the
11:35 - screen
11:36 - so we have x and y
11:40 - axis here
11:45 - so in order to
11:50 - locate everyone that is going to the
11:53 - stage
11:54 - in the middle of the screen we can go to
11:57 - the motion
12:00 - and then say go to x and y
12:03 - 0 0. so when i receive it's my turn to
12:06 - dance
12:08 - i go to
12:14 - this location
12:17 - zero and
12:20 - zero and when i'm done
12:24 - with dancing
12:27 - i call the next person and i also
12:32 - move away from the center so i can do
12:35 - glide one second
12:39 - because i wanted to horizontally just go
12:42 - to some direction left or right
12:46 - i keep the y as zero and i
12:49 - change this one to some number like
12:52 - 100 let's test it and see how it looks
12:55 - like
12:57 - so i stop i play
13:06 - it dances and it goes away i do
13:09 - this for another for the other
13:12 - characters as well
13:14 - so any character that is called to go to
13:18 - the dance floor
13:19 - goes to the center and then
13:22 - when it's done glides to the
13:26 - corner so i write it for alex
13:32 - when i receive turn go to
13:35 - zero zero
13:41 - and when i'm done
13:45 - glide to actually not random
13:48 - position glide to
13:53 - location maybe minus
14:00 - 100 and zero
14:04 - and do this the same thing for judy
14:09 - go to zero
14:13 - zero and then at the end
14:20 - glide location x
14:25 - 140 and 0.
14:27 - let's test it and see how it looks like
14:30 - i play
14:32 - so ellie dances
14:35 - goes to the corner so you see everyone
14:38 - that dances
14:40 - moves away and then the next one comes
14:43 - to the center
14:45 - just like a real party
14:49 - you can give your project a proper name
14:52 - from here
14:53 - which i call it dance party 2.
14:58 - and also
15:01 - we can add one thing
15:04 - which is everyone that is coming to the
15:07 - middle
15:08 - see a cloud on top of their head saying
15:12 - like i'm coming or basically showing
15:17 - that they are saying something
15:22 - so i go to le
15:25 - when i receive is my turn i go to this
15:28 - location
15:29 - and i want to see
15:33 - i want to say by
15:38 - writing
15:43 - ellie is coming
15:50 - actually less
15:56 - do it for like ellie is coming
16:00 - this one let's say this one
16:06 - l is coming for a short amount of time
16:10 - so i say say
16:14 - it is
16:19 - coming for maybe one second and then
16:22 - i don't want it to remain forever
16:28 - let's do this for other characters as
16:30 - well so
16:31 - from the looks
16:35 - as soon as it was called i can
16:38 - say
16:42 - hello alex
16:45 - is here and then the same for judy
16:56 - my turn
17:00 - judy is coming
17:05 - and also for one second
17:16 - now
17:19 - i i stop and play to see how it looks
17:22 - like
17:28 - all right now we have two more things to
17:31 - do
17:32 - adding a music and a backdrop
17:35 - and a light and the lighting let's see
17:40 - okay let's add a music to it as well so
17:43 - in order to have a music you first need
17:46 - to go to the sounds and add the music
17:48 - here first so i go here
17:51 - upload the sound upload sound
17:56 - actually if you want to choose some
17:58 - sound from your computer you go to
17:59 - upload sounds
18:01 - otherwise it's easier to just
18:07 - click here and choose a sound
18:10 - i can narrow down
18:13 - to dance and
18:16 - [Music]
18:19 - choose something
18:22 - [Music]
18:26 - i choose this one
18:29 - so now i have a song
18:33 - i go to my code currently
18:36 - the computer doesn't know that it should
18:38 - use the sound so i need to write a code
18:40 - to tell the computer to play the sound
18:43 - so in order to do that i say
18:47 - when i start click because i want this
18:49 - one to happen as soon as
18:51 - the start is clicked so from the events
18:55 - when start clicked
19:02 - repeat 10 times
19:05 - and then under sound
19:08 - play sound dance until done so i want it
19:11 - to be played 10 times
19:15 - but you can choose how many times that
19:17 - you like
19:18 - so i play and see
19:25 - so cool yay
19:29 - [Music]
19:33 - all right
19:38 - what else now we can add a backdrop as
19:41 - well
19:42 - let's go here
19:45 - and then let's choose a backdrop that is
19:48 - nice for a dance stage
19:52 - i like this one and this one
19:57 - let's do this one spotlight so i have a
20:00 - backdrop
20:01 - and one more thing we can do is
20:04 - to change the backdrop
20:08 - lighting so that it looks like the
20:12 - light is changing behind
20:18 - in scratch there is something which is
20:20 - really really cool
20:21 - which is color effect if i go to
20:24 - this backdrop if i click on here i can
20:28 - write a color effect code for the
20:30 - backdrop so that the lighting would be
20:32 - changed so
20:33 - again when start click
20:43 - then i go to the looks
20:47 - and then change color effect by
20:50 - something and i'm gonna repeat this
20:54 - action i'm going to say do this
20:58 - thing forever so
21:01 - i say forever
21:04 - change color effect by 25
21:08 - and maybe i can put some weight in
21:10 - between so that i see
21:11 - one color and then i wait a bit and then
21:14 - another color
21:14 - so wait
21:18 - maybe one second two seconds or
21:22 - whatever you like maybe just yeah let's
21:25 - play and see how it looks
21:32 - you see the color is being changed
21:36 - [Music]
