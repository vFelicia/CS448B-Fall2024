00:00 - hello everyone in this tutorial we are
00:03 - going to see
00:04 - how we can animate our name in scratch
00:07 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:10 - learn to code and have fun
00:12 - are you ready open
00:17 - let's dive in like always
00:20 - we go to scratch.edu.mit
00:25 - and then we click
00:29 - on the create so that we can create a
00:31 - new project
00:34 - and then i give it a name a proper name
00:37 - that indicates
00:38 - what i'm gonna do so i can say
00:41 - animate name or you can choose whatever
00:44 - you like
00:47 - let it load
00:51 - okay so i name it
00:54 - animate name i delete the cat
00:59 - since i'm gonna animate a name i need
01:02 - sprites
01:03 - that are in form of letters so i can
01:06 - import
01:06 - all the letters of my name and use them
01:10 - as a sprite so i click here
01:15 - and i go to the letters section
01:20 - so that i only see the letters all
01:22 - things letter
01:25 - so my name is ellie so i choose a
01:29 - and then i click again
01:35 - then another l
01:42 - one more l
01:47 - i have an eye
01:51 - you can import the letters of your own
01:54 - name or whatever
01:55 - sentence or anything you are interested
01:58 - to
01:59 - write there and animate so i arranged
02:02 - them in
02:02 - proper order so that is clear what i
02:05 - have here
02:06 - on the stage
02:11 - and now our sprites are ready so
02:14 - we're going to see what sort of
02:16 - animation we can do
02:18 - we can create with this sprites here
02:24 - let's start with a very simple animation
02:28 - let's say i want the color of the
02:31 - letters to be changed
02:32 - when i click on them so how to write
02:36 - this
02:36 - i click on this right i choose it
02:40 - and then i start writing the code first
02:43 - i need an event to trigger any action
02:48 - so i go to the events and
02:51 - i say when this sprite clicked because
02:55 - i want the animation to start when i'm
02:58 - clicking on the sprite
03:01 - and i want to change the color so
03:04 - since i'm saying color the next code
03:07 - should be
03:08 - on the looks i go to the looks and then
03:11 - i choose
03:14 - change color effect by
03:18 - default is 25 but you can
03:22 - change it to any other number so let's
03:25 - try and see what happens i click here
03:28 - oops this one was the e that i
03:34 - was using so i click here
03:38 - and then the color keeps changing
03:42 - isn't it cool i love it
03:46 - let's create another animation for
03:50 - the l what i want to happen is
03:54 - whenever i click on this
03:57 - i want it to spin so i want it to change
04:00 - direction slowly slowly
04:02 - so i say again when
04:08 - sprite clicked so when the sprite
04:11 - clicked
04:13 - what i want to happen is
04:16 - repeatedly changing the direction and
04:19 - turn turn turn
04:21 - so i say
04:24 - repeat maybe 10 times or
04:28 - forever it's your choice and then i want
04:32 - turn so turn is the motion so i go to
04:34 - the motion
04:36 - and then say let's turn 15 degree
04:41 - so i click it turns and turns and turns
04:46 - i can do both color change and turn
04:50 - at the same time if i want it to be more
04:53 - interesting
04:54 - but it's 100 percent your choice i just
04:57 - demo
04:58 - everything and then you can go and play
05:00 - but with it
05:01 - and create really cool animations
05:05 - for the next letter i
05:08 - want to play a sound so anytime that i
05:12 - click
05:13 - on this one i want to hear a sound
05:17 - let's see how
05:26 - um
05:29 - i go to the sounds
05:32 - and then from here i can choose a sound
05:39 - you can choose whatever you really like
05:48 - this is cool i choose this one
05:52 - and then i go back to the code
05:56 - and again i say when
05:59 - sprite clicked when this is right
06:02 - clicked
06:03 - now i want to play a sound so i go to
06:06 - the sound
06:08 - and then play sound until done
06:12 - let's see how it works
06:19 - so whenever i click i hear the sound
06:28 - so for the next one i want to create
06:31 - dancing letter animation how i do it
06:35 - is you see on the left corner there is
06:37 - this thing is called extension
06:39 - i click here and then i
06:43 - choose music so what happens
06:47 - something is added here which is the
06:49 - music
06:51 - set of codes so now i have some more
06:55 - codes
06:55 - available to me for playing the music
06:59 - and dancing letter
07:03 - then let's see how we can do that
07:07 - first i'm gonna write this for this
07:11 - i again like always
07:15 - when the sprite is clicked
07:19 - i want to create a dance so let's use a
07:22 - move
07:23 - i go to the motion and then i say
07:27 - move 10 steps
07:31 - and then i go to music i play a sound
07:34 - like
07:35 - play drum
07:38 - for some amount
07:41 - and then i take another move
07:46 - last time i moved 10 steps
07:49 - this time i move minus 10
07:53 - steps so it moves backward and then
07:56 - i again go to the music
08:00 - and then again i play drum
08:03 - so let's see how this one works
08:07 - you see it goes back and forth
08:10 - i can add the steps a bit more so that
08:13 - it's more
08:13 - clear what's happening
08:17 - so longer moves
08:22 - i have this cool dancing letters here
08:28 - for my last letter which is this
08:32 - e i'm gonna change the size so it grows
08:36 - bigger and becomes smaller with each
08:39 - click
08:40 - so again when sprite clicked
08:44 - when this right is clicked i'm going to
08:47 - repeat a set of actions
08:49 - for 10 times i do something and
08:53 - another 10 times i do different things
08:55 - so i take
08:56 - two of these blocks
09:00 - first time inside this repeat
09:04 - i say change size
09:08 - by 10. i need to drag it
09:13 - to go inside
09:16 - and one more time for the next repeat
09:20 - i say change size
09:24 - by -10
09:28 - let's see how it looks as i click
09:31 - it grows and then it gets back
09:35 - to the original slice
09:38 - so you see each of these letters have
09:41 - their own animation
09:43 - try to play around with the letters and
09:47 - do similar things with the rest of
09:50 - letters
09:52 - and share your projects with us we are
09:54 - excited to see what you can do
09:58 - in order to make this a bit more
09:59 - interesting i'm going to add a backdrop
10:01 - as well
10:03 - and then i'm going to share your share
10:05 - my project with you
10:07 - and i hope you are going to share yours
10:08 - with us as well
10:10 - i choose a heart as a backdrop
