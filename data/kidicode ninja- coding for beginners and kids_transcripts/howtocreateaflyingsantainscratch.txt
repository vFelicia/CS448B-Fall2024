00:06 - hello everyone
00:07 - welcome to another kitty code ninja
00:09 - tutorial
00:10 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:13 - learn to code and have fun
00:15 - in this tutorial we are going to see how
00:17 - we can create
00:18 - a flying center
00:22 - left i mean flying center let's go to
00:27 - scratch that's mit.edu
00:30 - and then when the page was loaded we
00:33 - click on the create
00:36 - from here we're going to see
00:40 - how we can create a flying santa in
00:43 - order to do that
00:44 - we need several sprites
00:47 - we need a flying center we need a
00:51 - sky backdrop and we need some elements
00:54 - that
00:55 - show a city so let's delete this cat
00:59 - for the backdrop let's just choose
01:02 - the simple blue sky
01:06 - so i click on the search
01:09 - and then blue sky
01:15 - on this on the sprite
01:21 - i want to make it look like that the
01:23 - santa is flying
01:24 - on top of a city so
01:27 - i choose the buildings
01:31 - the nice thing about this building is
01:34 - it has several customs
01:38 - which are really different
01:42 - like different buildings so
01:46 - this is a good one and then i need a
01:48 - cloud
01:50 - we can have multiple but for now i just
01:54 - use one
01:58 - because it shows what i want to do but
02:01 - then later on you can
02:03 - add more then i need a sprite
02:08 - which is a flying santa so i go to
02:12 - google image image.google.com
02:17 - and then i search for
02:23 - flying santa png
02:27 - so that the background is
02:32 - transparent
02:35 - then i choose this
02:38 - one
02:42 - that doesn't have the background
02:43 - background
02:46 - because it's like pixely
02:50 - and then i download this
02:54 - so i download so
02:57 - i save it somewhere
03:00 - i name it flying
03:04 - santa
03:08 - and then i save i go back to my scratch
03:12 - i click here and then i click on the
03:15 - upload sprite
03:20 - now my flying santa is here
03:25 - i import it as i have this beautiful
03:28 - flying santa here
03:32 - now the trick is
03:36 - instead when i want to make it look like
03:39 - that this santa is flying
03:42 - instead i move the
03:46 - other elements on my page it still looks
03:48 - like
03:49 - this one is flying like when you are in
03:51 - the train and you're
03:52 - looking at the view or on a road trip
03:55 - and you think that
03:56 - everything is moving but you are moving
03:58 - actually so when i click the start
04:01 - this center should be visible so i would
04:04 - say
04:07 - when start clicked
04:16 - show
04:21 - i also wanted to say merry christmas so
04:24 - from the looks i take
04:28 - maybe for two seconds only
04:31 - say
04:37 - mary christmas
04:41 - so it's
04:45 - shown and it says merry christmas so
04:49 - good enough for now and then
04:52 - flying sensation so i do that
04:56 - by moving the building so i move the
05:00 - building and it will look like that the
05:03 - santa is moving so i want to start
05:06 - by having the building at the very right
05:10 - corner of the page so i would say
05:13 - when start clicked
05:18 - i set the initial position as
05:22 - set x to 250 which is
05:27 - the corner so if you look at this number
05:29 - when i move this
05:34 - 250 is almost here so i start by
05:39 - 250 and then
05:43 - i want to i want to take smaller steps
05:45 - towards the left so i would say
05:49 - i'm repeating my steps so i say forever
05:54 - repeat
06:00 - let's say 100 times
06:04 - and then taking steps by changing
06:07 - x by minus
06:11 - five so minus because i'm moving towards
06:14 - the left so
06:15 - five multiply a hundred as 500
06:18 - which is the width of this
06:22 - this thing now if i click start
06:27 - that's what happens it kind of gives the
06:30 - illusion that this santa is moving
06:33 - not quite yet though i'm gonna enhance
06:36 - the thing by
06:37 - making some more stuff here so that it
06:40 - really would look like that the santa is
06:42 - moving so
06:44 - all right let's also give our project a
06:46 - name from here
06:48 - which is flying santa
06:53 - and then let's write a code for the
06:55 - santa to
06:56 - be able to interact with it i click on
07:00 - the flying center
07:02 - and then i want to be able to interact
07:05 - with the center by pressing my right
07:09 - left up and down arrows to control it so
07:13 - i would go to
07:18 - events and then
07:23 - when
07:26 - i drag this block of code
07:30 - i drag it four times or one time and
07:33 - ctrl c
07:34 - four times paste three more times space
07:38 - totally four and then i
07:42 - would say
07:46 - when
07:49 - right are up arrow clicked and
07:53 - when down arrow clicked
07:56 - and when right arrow and when
08:01 - left arrow clicked for this these four
08:06 - actions i wanna write a movement
08:10 - so for right arrow i would say
08:14 - change x by
08:18 - 10 for left arrow
08:21 - change x by -10
08:26 - up arrow change
08:29 - y by 10
08:32 - and for down arrow
08:37 - change y by
08:42 - minus 10. by the way i changed my santa
08:46 - to new one behind the scene
08:50 - um let's start i test it again
08:54 - so i go right up down left and
08:58 - everything is working very well
09:02 - okay now it's time to animate this
09:05 - cloud as well in order to do that i
09:08 - click on the cloud
09:09 - so i get to the code page of the cloud
09:12 - so
09:15 - i start by for ever
09:19 - i want a repetitive action
09:25 - and first i set the
09:29 - position so i would set
09:33 - y from motions
09:38 - i set y to
09:42 - a random position
09:45 - which is going to be
09:48 - from the operator i take
09:52 - pick random so i pick a random position
09:57 - i want the cloud to stay at the top
10:00 - half of the screen so
10:04 - above this line so i would say
10:07 - a random position between
10:10 - 1 2 180
10:14 - so anything okay so set y to
10:18 - this number and set x to
10:26 - i will set it to 250 because
10:31 - i want to start from the right of the
10:35 - screen so the y somewhere random here
10:39 - but the x starts from here
10:44 - now i'm gonna repeatedly move the
10:48 - move the cloud so i would say repeat
10:53 - repeat i would take
10:58 - 50 steps and each
11:01 - steps i move
11:04 - x by 10
11:08 - towards the left so minus 10
11:12 - which means 10 months multiply 500
11:15 - which is the width of the screen so i'm
11:18 - going to start
11:22 - i placed i didn't write when
11:26 - start clicked so i add the when
11:29 - start click so i test it i play start
11:32 - and you see the cloud is moving the
11:34 - santa
11:35 - is moving by my arrow key pressed
11:40 - it's pretty much looks like the santa is
11:42 - flying on top of a
11:43 - city something is missing santa without
11:47 - a gift
11:48 - is not a santa so let's add a gift as
11:51 - well
11:51 - so from the sprites
11:56 - i search for a gift i want the santa to
11:59 - drop
12:00 - gifts so i inside the gift
12:05 - is dropping the gift is similar to the
12:09 - way that
12:10 - we created snowfall effect
12:13 - in the last video so i start
12:16 - by clicking on the gift i go to the code
12:20 - and then i say when
12:24 - start clicked
12:28 - i wanted to
12:32 - go with the center so i say
12:36 - go to
12:40 - santa
12:45 - and at the same time i want it to be
12:50 - hidden
12:53 - okay now it's hidden with the scent
12:58 - then i would say when
13:03 - i start as a clone
13:07 - when i start as a clone
13:11 - i want to be first make sure i'm hidden
13:17 - so initially hide it
13:21 - still go to center because
13:24 - that's the starting point so i again
13:27 - repeat it here
13:28 - go to center
13:32 - and then go to the next costume because
13:35 - i want to try
13:36 - different colors of the
13:41 - gift box and now
13:44 - i want it to be shown so after it
13:48 - appeared we need to
13:51 - drop it down so i drop it by the
13:55 - repetitive movements like repetitive
13:59 - actions of coming down so i would
14:02 - say repeat until
14:05 - and then from the sensing i would say
14:08 - touching
14:11 - edge so it comes down until it
14:14 - reaches the edge how to come down
14:19 - by changing y
14:24 - by a negative number
14:28 - so one thing is missing
14:32 - which is we haven't created a clone yet
14:35 - so i go to the backdrop and i add this
14:38 - code of when
14:42 - start clicked
14:46 - let's say i want the santa to have 50
14:50 - boxes
14:51 - of gift for 50 kids
14:54 - i would say repeat 50
15:00 - 50 clowns
15:05 - create clone of myself
15:08 - from the
15:12 - i not myself create clone of the
15:16 - gift and
15:19 - wait in between to give it
15:23 - some time wait
15:27 - one second so now let's
15:30 - play test it
15:34 - i play start
15:41 - santa is moving i can move it
15:46 - and i can drop the gifts for children
15:49 - such a cool christmas if you like the
