00:13 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:16 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
00:19 - to code and have fun
00:21 - all right first thing first
00:24 - let's give our project a good name
00:27 - cherry blossom
00:32 - i got rid of the cat already i need
00:36 - two sprites which i'm gonna draw by
00:38 - myself
00:39 - using paint one is the
00:43 - tree trunk and the other one is gonna be
00:47 - blossoms cherry blossom so
00:50 - brown for the trunk
00:54 - the bottom is white so i'm gonna take a
00:57 - big one
00:59 - i'm just gonna draw quickly but you take
01:02 - your time
01:03 - and do your best
01:07 - i'm gonna make it smaller now for the
01:10 - branches
01:15 - [Music]
01:38 - do
01:41 - [Music]
01:45 - now also let's use paint again
01:49 - to draw cherry blossoms
01:53 - which is pink
01:57 - actually i'm gonna use this circle
02:01 - and then when it comes to feel i go here
02:04 - to give it some like a
02:05 - shadow i need two colors
02:09 - so try to choose around pink and
02:13 - white so
02:17 - how do i get white like a pinkish white
02:21 - yeah
02:22 - this is what i like now draw one circle
02:28 - ctrl c ctrl we
02:32 - maybe four or five times
02:38 - put them together
02:45 - and then just group them so
02:49 - select everything and group
02:54 - now make the smaller
02:57 - and then ctrl c ctrl we
03:04 - and just spread it down
03:20 - [Music]
03:27 - another ctrl c ctrl v
03:32 - [Music]
03:41 - full of flowers all right
03:44 - now let's get to the code another thing
03:48 - we need is a sound from here
03:52 - i'm gonna choose the sound
03:56 - emotional you can obviously choose
03:58 - whatever you like
04:00 - but this is really cool i love it
04:04 - so romantic okay stop
04:08 - let's get down to the business um
04:13 - okay so getting back to the tree
04:17 - i'm gonna say when start clicked
04:21 - i'll look at this so cute
04:25 - one style clicked i wanna make sure that
04:28 - the location is staying
04:32 - where it currently is and i'm gonna show
04:35 - make sure it's visible so i'm gonna show
04:40 - it i'm gonna play that
04:43 - romantic song that we chose so
04:47 - sounds and then start
04:50 - sound
04:55 - what happened to the sound i chose
05:00 - oh let's
05:10 - bring it again okay now it's there
05:14 - start sound emotional piano
05:20 - and now i'm gonna broadcast a message
05:24 - to the blossoms from here
05:27 - using event broadcast
05:32 - new message start to bloom
05:38 - okay and then
05:43 - drag it here so this is
05:47 - the part for the tree now let's get
05:53 - this sprite so this one also
05:56 - when start clicked
06:01 - i want to make sure it's in the location
06:04 - that it currently is
06:06 - so go to this location
06:09 - so the number currently i see here
06:11 - corresponds to where
06:13 - it currently is
06:16 - in contrast to the trunk i want the
06:20 - cherry blossoms not to be shot so i'm
06:23 - going to hide it
06:26 - so this is the start position but
06:30 - when i receive start to bloom
06:33 - now what i do is
06:37 - i start
06:41 - from i don't want to be hidden i want to
06:45 - show it but i want to show it with
06:49 - ghost effect so i'm gonna
06:53 - bring
07:00 - change
07:02 - set
07:05 - ghost effect to some
07:08 - really big number so i want it to be
07:12 - like a ghost invisible and then i'm
07:15 - gonna show it
07:17 - so i'm gonna show it but invisible now
07:20 - in a loop i'm gonna slowly
07:24 - slowly reveal it so repeat
07:31 - a thousand times or whatever you want
07:36 - just a big number now let's
07:39 - slowly slowly increase the ghost effect
07:44 - actually decrease the ghost effect so
07:47 - that
07:47 - it becomes the ghost effect is gone and
07:50 - it's
07:51 - becoming visible let's start
