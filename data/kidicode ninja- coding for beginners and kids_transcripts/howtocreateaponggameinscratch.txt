00:00 - hello welcome back to kirikou ninja
00:03 - tutorials
00:04 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:07 - learn to code and have fun
00:09 - in this tutorial we're going to create a
00:11 - pawn game in
00:12 - scratch let's dive in
00:15 - okay before doing anything let's see a
00:18 - demo
00:19 - of the game first so
00:22 - this is what we are going to
00:25 - develop we have
00:29 - this ball on the stage that is supposed
00:32 - to bounce around and by
00:33 - this green thing i'm controlling this
00:36 - i'm preventing this ball from
00:38 - falling down this green thing moves
00:42 - horizontally by moving my mouse so when
00:46 - i move my mouse
00:47 - left it moves left and when i move my
00:49 - mouse right it moves right
00:52 - and when the ball hits the the red line
00:55 - i'm game over so if i play start
01:00 - i move this green thing so that the ball
01:03 - doesn't come down
01:08 - and then if i let it fall
01:12 - i'm gonna be game over so now i don't
01:14 - move it
01:18 - until it falls down and hits the red
01:21 - line so that i can show you can see
01:24 - how we can be game over
01:27 - we're kind of lucky here that it doesn't
01:29 - fall down
01:32 - so i move it a bit here
01:36 - yes now this game is finished so
01:40 - let's see how we can program this now
01:43 - time to write the code let's again go to
01:47 - scratch.mit.edu like always
01:49 - and then we click on the create button
01:54 - here now i can create a new game
01:57 - or new whatever animation anything
02:00 - from here our goal today is creating a
02:04 - pawn game
02:05 - so when the page opened
02:10 - i delete this cat
02:13 - first let's put a backdrop i click here
02:18 - and i choose some
02:21 - backdrop
02:25 - we can choose maybe
02:30 - this one and then we need to choose a
02:34 - ball
02:38 - so i search for
02:42 - ball
02:45 - we can take any ball that we like
02:49 - i choose this one
02:55 - and then let's first
02:59 - write let's first bounce this ball
03:02 - around so
03:04 - the first sprite that we are programming
03:08 - is balancing the ball how we can do that
03:14 - uh we start everything usually with
03:17 - when start clicked so
03:20 - i drag this block of code when it start
03:23 - clicked
03:26 - i turn the ball to some direction
03:29 - and from there i ask it to move
03:33 - around and also
03:36 - i need to tell the ball what to do when
03:39 - is touching
03:39 - the edges so
03:43 - first thing from the motions i turn
03:47 - the ball turn some degrees
03:51 - maybe 15 degrees or you can change it to
03:54 - anything you like
03:56 - after turning the ball something needs
03:59 - to be repeatedly
04:00 - done which so since i'm saying
04:03 - repeatedly
04:05 - i use this forever
04:10 - from the control
04:13 - so forever so it turns
04:18 - to some direction it needs to move
04:22 - so from the motions i say move
04:27 - the default is 10 step i can make it
04:30 - maybe
04:30 - 15 16 or whatever the more the faster
04:34 - so it moves to some direction and then
04:36 - something needs to happen
04:37 - when it touches the edge if i
04:40 - look here there is a code
04:45 - for if on edge bound so
04:49 - if it hits the edge it would bounce
04:52 - so let's play and see what happens
04:56 - really cool it moves around when it
04:59 - touches the edges
05:03 - it bounces
05:06 - so let's stop and go to the next step
05:10 - now let's write the second step which is
05:13 - moving the paddle so
05:15 - we need a paddle first let's go here and
05:18 - choose a paddle
05:20 - sprite so i search for paddle
05:26 - which is this green thing
05:30 - now i need to write i drag it down
05:34 - i need to write a code so that when my
05:37 - mouth is moving to the right and left
05:41 - this palette is also following it or
05:45 - like moving to the right and left
05:47 - whatever what a code could be first when
05:52 - start clicked
05:56 - so when start clicked
06:01 - i need something to happen forever
06:04 - so i choose the forever block
06:08 - i drag the forever block
06:11 - and then in order to follow the mouse
06:14 - on the horizontal direction there is
06:19 - something here set
06:22 - x 2
06:28 - so i drag set x 2 from here
06:32 - and then instead of this number i go to
06:35 - the
06:36 - sensing
06:39 - we have this mouse x so whatever
06:42 - is the position of the mouse
06:46 - this paddle would take the same position
06:50 - so here we can see the mouse position
06:55 - so this paddle would
06:58 - follow the mouse my mouse pointer
07:00 - position that we can see it here so if i
07:03 - click start you see
07:07 - this x is changing
07:11 - over there and my paddle
07:15 - is following my mouse okay
07:18 - we're done with this step as well so i'm
07:20 - gonna stop it and then we can see
07:23 - the next step the next step is
07:27 - i want the ball to bounce off the paddle
07:31 - whenever it's hitting the pedal so
07:34 - how to ride this i'm gonna write a
07:38 - program for the ball so i click on the
07:40 - basketball
07:42 - sprite or whatever bulb that you have
07:45 - and then again i say
07:48 - when start clicked like before
07:58 - i need something to be happening
08:01 - regularly
08:02 - so i'm taking forever and dragging
08:06 - forever
08:09 - what i want to happen is i'm
08:12 - thinking about a condition i want the
08:15 - ball to bounce
08:17 - if only if is touching
08:21 - the paddle so i need an if
08:24 - i go to the control
08:29 - and then i drag the if block
08:32 - so as i said my condition was
08:37 - touching paddles so on the sensing i can
08:40 - find
08:41 - touch touching
08:46 - paddle i drag it here and i
08:50 - put it inside that if so if touching
08:53 - pedal
08:54 - then i want it to bounce so in order to
08:57 - balance it needs to
08:58 - turn a little bit and then
09:02 - move so
09:08 - from the motion
09:11 - i take turn
09:14 - for the turn let's choose a number
09:17 - between
09:18 - maybe 150
09:21 - to
09:25 - 180 so from the operator
09:29 - i say turn
09:36 - and then i
09:40 - take a random number
09:43 - so again i show it here from the
09:47 - operator
09:48 - pick random number instead of 15
09:52 - between 100 50
09:55 - 70 to 190 the reason is
10:01 - i wanted to bounce back so the direction
10:05 - should
10:06 - be almost opposite what it was so almost
10:10 - 170 to 90
10:12 - so like mirroring it and then bouncing
10:15 - it
10:16 - so first turn and then move
10:20 - and then i take move
10:24 - this time i can
10:28 - choose maybe 10 if i wanted to go slower
10:32 - than this one or i can
10:34 - do whatever i want and then i also
10:37 - want to have some weight in between
10:40 - moves
10:42 - [Music]
10:44 - to make the
10:48 - movements look a bit more natural
10:52 - so from control
10:58 - i take wait
11:02 - a tiny bit maybe half a second
11:07 - let's see how it works i
11:10 - play and then i move my mouse
11:14 - so that when the ball is this green
11:17 - paddle
11:18 - it bounces up
11:23 - really cool isn't it i love it
11:26 - okay stop now the last step
11:31 - is we want to add a red line
11:34 - so that when the ball is the red line
11:37 - the game
11:38 - is over let's see how to write it
11:43 - to program the game over we need a red
11:46 - line
11:46 - so from the sprites
11:50 - i choose i search
11:53 - for line
11:58 - so we have the line here
12:01 - now i need to program the line again
12:04 - when start clicked
12:07 - from the event so when start clicked
12:12 - so first thing is after start
12:15 - i want this red line to drop down to the
12:18 - lowest
12:19 - position so how to write this
12:22 - i can write it like go to
12:27 - x 0
12:31 - y minus
12:36 - 170
12:40 - so it will drop to the very bottom of
12:44 - the
12:44 - stage and then
12:49 - again game over thing is something that
12:52 - happens
12:53 - forever so forever something is to be
12:55 - checked
12:56 - which is whenever the ball hits the red
12:58 - line
12:59 - then we're game over so i need a forever
13:03 - which is in the control
13:06 - so forever and then i need a condition
13:10 - so i go to the if
13:13 - i drag an if then from control and my
13:17 - condition
13:17 - is if touching the ball
13:23 - so from the sensing i drag
13:28 - touching basketball
13:33 - so if my red line is touching the
13:37 - basketball then i need
13:40 - everything to be stopped so that
13:43 - i'm game over so
13:46 - from the control again
13:50 - i have
13:53 - stop all which is here
13:57 - so i drag it and then
14:00 - let's play the game
14:05 - i click start
14:09 - right away i was game over so i put it
14:12 - up again i drag it up up again so i
14:15 - click start
14:16 - and then oops i gained over so quickly
14:21 - so i need to be really quick not to let
14:23 - the ball
14:24 - to hit the red so again i click
14:28 - i put it up i click
14:31 - okay yeah so with the
14:35 - paddle i can push up
14:38 - the ball but then if i not quick enough
14:41 - so that
14:42 - it's hitting the red line i'm game over
14:45 - so
14:45 - we're done with writing this code
14:50 - this was an easy and very interesting
14:53 - game
14:54 - i'm gonna put the link to the code in
14:57 - the scratch website
14:59 - in the comments below so that you can go
15:01 - and check it out
15:02 - and see it more clearly uh feel free to
