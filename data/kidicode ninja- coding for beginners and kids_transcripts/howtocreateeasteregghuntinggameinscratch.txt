00:01 - hello hello hello how are you doing
00:04 - i hope you are all doing wonderful
00:09 - in this tutorial we are going to develop
00:11 - a easter egg hunting game esther bunny
00:14 - has hidden eggs in various places
00:17 - in random places and our job
00:20 - is to find those eggs and gain
00:24 - scores let's see how we can make this
00:28 - if you're not familiar with what easter
00:30 - egg hunting is
00:32 - watch this the bunny is hidden yes ready
00:35 - when you found all the eggs we shared
00:37 - them out eating
00:39 - danny dogs has found an egg under a
00:40 - plant sushi sheep has found it in a bush
00:43 - peppa has found an egg in a tree
00:45 - george has found one finished
00:49 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:52 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
00:55 - to code and have fun
00:58 - okay let's dive right in by giving a
01:02 - good name to our project easter
01:08 - egg hunting and then we're gonna start
01:12 - with the cat except we're going to
01:15 - delete it
01:15 - bye and now we need eggs
01:22 - there is an egg in the scratch
01:27 - but it's not colorful so i'm gonna take
01:30 - this balloon
01:32 - and i'm gonna duplicate it
01:36 - i'm duplicating only three because it's
01:39 - just for the purpose of demo
01:41 - but the more eggs you have
01:44 - is going to be more interesting of
01:47 - course
01:49 - those are a little big 20
01:54 - or like make it 30
02:00 - and the same for
02:05 - this one and this one
02:08 - so i make them smaller
02:13 - so these are not yet
02:16 - looking like egg but i can go to
02:19 - costumes
02:21 - first of all i want three colors
02:24 - so for the first one i keep blue
02:27 - for the second one i delete everything
02:31 - except yellow and for the third
02:35 - one i delete x
02:38 - everything except red
02:42 - if you wanted more eggs you can later on
02:44 - change this
02:45 - colors now to make it
02:50 - like an egg i'm gonna delete this part
02:56 - and this part and this part
03:00 - and rotate
03:05 - same here
03:08 - and same here
03:12 - we can add a bit of pattern to it
03:17 - so that is more history
03:27 - the same here and
03:31 - here
03:35 - oops what did i do all right
03:38 - good enough we have three eggs three
03:41 - eggs now
03:43 - we also need two backdrops
03:48 - so for the backdrop
03:52 - i'm gonna choose this
03:56 - forest and i'm also
03:59 - choosing another backdrop for when
04:03 - we are a game over
04:06 - which can be
04:10 - maybe this one
04:14 - let's also add a lot of sprites
04:18 - to cover the eggs because we want to
04:21 - hide eggs right so we need to have more
04:24 - stuff there i'm gonna choose
04:28 - a burr the the first backdrop
04:32 - i'm also gonna choose
04:40 - a butterfly you can just pick as many
04:44 - as you want take your time but i'm just
04:47 - gonna be
04:48 - quick
04:48 - [Music]
04:53 - maybe clouds all right just put them
04:58 - in the reasonable locations
05:02 - now it's time to write the code
05:05 - so let's write the code for
05:09 - the eggs we start by
05:12 - when start clicked
05:18 - since easter bunny has hidden the eggs
05:22 - in a random locations
05:25 - i'm gonna say to the egg
05:28 - to go to random
05:31 - position when the start is clicked
05:35 - and then i want to keep
05:39 - hiding and showing the eggs so i go to
05:42 - looks
05:44 - and since i'm saying i want to keep so i
05:46 - go to controls and
05:48 - take a forever and then
05:52 - i would say from the looks
05:57 - height and show
06:00 - with a weight
06:04 - in between
06:12 - so one one second wait after
06:15 - show and after between hide and
06:18 - show we need one more weight
06:22 - also
06:26 - except that we don't want all of them to
06:29 - be
06:30 - one second and so that the eggs are not
06:33 - appearing all at the same time
06:36 - instead we say pick random number
06:40 - between one two let's say
06:43 - seven so what happens is that
06:46 - this egg would go to
06:50 - a random location hide itself
06:54 - and then wait a random number and
06:57 - appears just
07:02 - like this
07:07 - one more thing that we need to do is
07:09 - keep track
07:10 - of the scores when we are collecting
07:13 - eggs so i'm gonna create a variable
07:17 - i'm naming it score
07:22 - and since this eggs are appearing
07:25 - forever
07:26 - we wanna have a finish
07:30 - time for when we assume all the eggs
07:33 - are collected we keep track of it using
07:37 - score so i'm gonna say
07:41 - every time i click on the sprite which
07:44 - is egg i'm gaining a score so
07:49 - under control i say
07:56 - when
07:58 - i'm looking for when this sprite
08:02 - is clicked so on the event when this
08:05 - sprite is clicked
08:08 - ink only if
08:12 - so let's go to control i'm gonna take an
08:16 - if else condition
08:19 - if score is less than something
08:22 - [Music]
08:24 - let's say i want to collect five eggs
08:29 - if the score so from the variables i'm
08:32 - dragging
08:33 - score is less than five
08:38 - let's play a sound
08:41 - start sound pop and also
08:45 - change score by one
08:49 - change score by one so
08:54 - every time i can catch an egg or find an
08:57 - egg
08:57 - i'm gaining one point
09:01 - and if score is more than five
09:04 - or equal to five in that case
09:08 - i want to finish the game and i'm doing
09:12 - it by broadcasting a message
09:15 - so on the event
09:18 - i'm taking a broadcast new message since
09:22 - we never created a message
09:27 - finished
09:32 - so broadcast finished
09:37 - now that i've broadcasted finish
09:40 - i'm going to backdrop and i
09:44 - add an event when i receive
09:48 - finished
09:54 - from the looks go to
09:57 - switch back drop to hearts
10:01 - and play sound
10:05 - win we need to
10:08 - bring it here sound
10:12 - i'm gonna add the sound
10:17 - when
10:20 - so going back to code play
10:23 - sound when and stop all the script
10:27 - because we're done done
10:31 - event
10:35 - it should be under control so stop
10:37 - everything
10:38 - since we are in the backdrop
10:41 - i'm gonna add when
10:44 - start clicked go to
10:49 - so like my initial setup is i want to be
10:52 - on backdrop forest
10:56 - and also i want the score variable to be
11:01 - zero set score to
11:06 - zero
11:10 - now we are pretty much done with the
11:12 - code except that
11:14 - we need to copy the coat
11:17 - that we wrote for the egg to other eggs
11:20 - as well
11:21 - which is done simply by dragging the
11:24 - coat
11:25 - on top of this
11:28 - we do it the same for this
11:32 - and this egg and this
11:36 - egg so let's
11:39 - test it i play start
11:43 - oh that's not good it went to backdrop
11:47 - two
11:48 - so let's go to here
11:52 - uh is here i put next backdrop
11:56 - what's wrong with me i should put
12:01 - such backdrop to
12:05 - forest
12:08 - other than this i think should be okay
12:12 - okay so score is zero backdrop is
12:14 - correct
12:15 - just look at the eggs any egg that
12:17 - appear i
12:18 - click oops it's pretty much
12:22 - difficult not so easy not so easy
12:26 - it's really fun though yay
12:30 - we won i hope you
12:33 - liked this game if you did give it a
