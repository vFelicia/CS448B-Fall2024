00:00 - hello how are you doing i hope you are
00:03 - all
00:03 - feeling wonderful in this tutorial we
00:07 - are going to see
00:08 - how we can create a working clip like
00:11 - this one
00:13 - is showing the actual time just like
00:16 - a real stick around we're gonna see
00:20 - how we can make this
00:23 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:26 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
00:29 - to code and have fun
00:31 - all right let's see what do we need to
00:33 - make this we need
00:35 - three things a backdrop for this
00:38 - yellow part and then we need
00:41 - a sprite for this little lines
00:46 - and then another sprite for
00:49 - the handles that show the second
00:53 - hour and the minute let's see how
00:57 - i encourage you to follow along with me
01:00 - so log into your account and then click
01:03 - on this
01:04 - create after
01:07 - the project was loaded
01:10 - delete the cat go to the backdrop
01:14 - and search for something that looks
01:17 - similar to the clock
01:20 - i'm like the clock face so i'm gonna
01:23 - take this
01:24 - light for my backdrop and then
01:27 - from the sides for the degree
01:31 - for those little lines like this
01:34 - lines i'm gonna take
01:38 - the button sprite
01:41 - and then for the
01:47 - handles i need
01:50 - one sprite with three costumes so
01:54 - i go for search i can draw it in paint
01:59 - but it's much faster if i can find
02:02 - something
02:04 - similar to a clock handle
02:08 - which here we go this line
02:12 - so let's adjust the size
02:16 - i'm gonna make this much smaller
02:20 - because this is this little things here
02:24 - and then this is gonna be used
02:28 - for a second
02:32 - so going let's make this size like
02:36 - 20. it does need to be still
02:39 - much smaller so i go to the costume
02:43 - and then i drag it from here
02:48 - so that it can be used for
02:52 - the second
02:57 - duplicate it one more time make it
03:00 - a little smaller and a little wider
03:04 - to show than minutes
03:09 - let's also change the color
03:12 - to make it let's say
03:16 - gray
03:20 - so this is gonna be for a minute
03:24 - you can play with the
03:34 - and then
03:37 - so this is minute let's change the name
03:39 - here also
03:41 - to minute
03:45 - and second
03:51 - let's duplicate this again
03:55 - make it a little bit shorter again
03:59 - so that it's gonna be shorter
04:02 - and wider to show
04:07 - the handle for the hour
04:10 - a little bit shorter okay here we go
04:18 - now i'm gonna show you something really
04:20 - cool
04:21 - in order to do that in order to draw the
04:23 - clock
04:24 - completely first thing you need to do is
04:27 - go to
04:28 - here and
04:31 - add the pen extension so that you can
04:34 - access
04:35 - these codes and then also make sure to
04:39 - be
04:39 - on the button sprite so for this
04:43 - lines i'm gonna name this
04:50 - just i'm gonna name it degrees
04:54 - to refer to those little lines on the
04:56 - clock
04:58 - and then let's say when
05:02 - start clicked
05:07 - go to the
05:10 - center of the screen
05:14 - and then i'm gonna erase everything so
05:17 - from the pen
05:19 - there is a code erase all
05:26 - after we got a clear
05:29 - screen after erasing everything i'm
05:32 - gonna write a code
05:34 - to create this
05:37 - blue lines that are that are showing the
05:40 - hours so like here is 12 o'clock
05:43 - one o'clock two three so this is what
05:46 - i'm gonna
05:47 - draw on my clock i'm gonna use stamp
05:52 - so i have this sprite i'm gonna rotate
05:55 - and the stamp rotate and snap rotate and
05:58 - stamp rotate and
06:00 - stamp so since we have 12
06:03 - hours on the clock i'm going to repeat
06:07 - 12 times rotate stamp rotate the stamp
06:10 - rotate stamp
06:12 - and then in order to know how many
06:15 - degrees i need to rotate
06:18 - from here to here i should divide
06:23 - 360
06:25 - by 12 which is going to be
06:28 - 30 every rotation degrees
06:32 - so let's write the code
06:36 - since we said we have 12 hours
06:39 - i'm going to control repeat
06:44 - 12 times and then
06:48 - turn so from the motions
06:52 - so i'm writing a code for this
06:55 - blue thing
07:00 - so turn from motion
07:07 - 30 degrees because 360 divided by
07:12 - 12 30 degrees
07:18 - so remember this thing is right now in
07:21 - the center
07:23 - so it's turning
07:27 - 30 degrees only like this
07:32 - and then now it needs to move
07:37 - all the way to the end of the clock so i
07:40 - say
07:41 - move or
07:44 - yeah move move move
07:48 - maybe 100 steps
07:52 - and now stamp
07:58 - so the same pattern is going to be
08:00 - stamped here
08:02 - and now i want it to go back to where it
08:04 - was so it's putting the stamp of itself
08:07 - and then it's going
08:08 - back
08:08 - [Music]
08:11 - now move again
08:21 - minus 100
08:24 - steps so this action is gonna be
08:27 - repeated 12
08:28 - times so i expect to see 12
08:32 - blue lines around this to refer to ours
08:35 - let's
08:35 - run it like this
08:39 - super cool now i want it to go
08:43 - a bit closer to the edge so instead of
08:46 - 100 maybe 120 and
08:50 - 120 here as well let's run it again
08:55 - it looks much better pretty cool isn't
08:58 - it
08:59 - so one little problem is that this
09:02 - orange ones are covering the blue ones
09:05 - so i'm going to the costume
09:08 - and making this
09:12 - blue ones a little bigger
09:16 - make sure to click on this arrow and
09:20 - drag it to make it
09:22 - longer than the other one
09:26 - as long as it fits let's try again
09:34 - it's better now something really
09:36 - important that you can do when you
09:38 - program
09:39 - is like when you see that this code is
09:42 - going to be very long use blocks so
09:46 - i'm going to create a block from my
09:49 - black
09:50 - makeup like and then i'm gonna name it
09:53 - draw
09:55 - like i'm also gonna check
09:58 - run without screen refresh
10:01 - so okay with this block i'm defining
10:06 - drawing the clock so all i need to do is
10:11 - drag draw a clock so this little code
10:16 - is much easier to read and also
10:20 - i can always
10:24 - drag this to my backpack
10:27 - and be able to reuse it in other
10:30 - programs and always
10:32 - just call draw clock
10:35 - okay so this part so far was drawing the
10:38 - clock but we also
10:40 - now need to show the actual time so that
10:43 - our plug is functional let's see how
10:49 - for showing the time
10:52 - using this clock handles i'm gonna
10:55 - use the clone if you're not familiar
10:59 - with the clone i have another
11:01 - video that i will put on the description
11:03 - so that you can go there
11:05 - and play with clones a little bit and
11:07 - then come back here
11:09 - but what i have to do here is for
11:12 - each handle for the
11:15 - minute hour and second i'm gonna create
11:19 - a clone
11:20 - since i'm gonna repeat something create
11:23 - clone for
11:24 - three things three customs
11:27 - and this let's let's change the name
11:31 - of this one to handle or like clock
11:35 - handle
11:39 - when a start clicked repeat
11:43 - three times
11:50 - before repeating i'm gonna hide
11:55 - those handles first
11:59 - and then repeat three times
12:06 - go to next costume so for each costume
12:10 - including second minute and
12:14 - hour
12:17 - we create a clone
12:21 - so just create a clone of my
12:24 - self
12:30 - now we are gonna use those clones to
12:34 - show the time let's say we're gonna use
12:39 - the let's start with
12:43 - showing the second so
12:46 - when i start as a clone
12:51 - now we need to show the clone previously
12:54 - it was
12:54 - hidden so let's go to looks
12:59 - show and also let's make sure that it's
13:03 - going to the center of the clock
13:07 - so go to the center
13:11 - and some rotation pointing to the
13:15 - specific time should happen forever
13:17 - because it's a clock
13:19 - right is gonna work forever
13:22 - so control forever
13:30 - now this handle the clone of this handle
13:35 - that is now being shown from
13:38 - hiran
13:41 - it needs to point to a certain
13:49 - number or a certain
13:52 - second certain line referring to number
13:54 - around the clock
13:55 - [Music]
13:58 - so i would say point to ours
14:01 - a direction point in direction
14:09 - which direction i want it to point to
14:12 - that direction
14:14 - should be current second
14:18 - so from sensing you can take
14:28 - current
14:30 - second but
14:36 - how many because this thing is the
14:39 - degree it should rotate
14:42 - so for every second on the clock for
14:46 - every orange
14:47 - line we have 6 degrees
14:51 - because remember here we turn
14:54 - 60 degrees and then we stamp one orange
14:57 - line
14:59 - which represents a second
15:02 - so i would say
15:07 - current second multiply six
15:12 - second multiply 6
15:15 - the degree of rotation
15:20 - for pointing to the second let's see how
15:22 - it works
15:23 - now if i click start
15:28 - it's pretty much turning like it's
15:31 - showing the second
15:33 - but something is wrong which is
15:36 - other degree other handles are also
15:39 - rotating
15:40 - which is not what we want so we need to
15:42 - differentiate them
15:44 - using an if condition
15:47 - so let's go to if
15:50 - i want to say do this only if
15:54 - the costume is the one which is
15:58 - for the second so
16:02 - let's go to operator and take this
16:08 - we're gonna compare something and then
16:11 - from looks i would say if you go to the
16:14 - bottom of the looks
16:16 - there is something custom number change
16:18 - it to custom name
16:20 - and put it here if custom name
16:23 - is second only at that time do this
16:28 - so now you see that it's showing the
16:31 - clock
16:33 - i want to drag this handle to here
16:42 - okay i should go to custom and i should
16:45 - go here
16:46 - and make sure it's
16:49 - here so if you look at this
16:53 - thing i'm gonna zoom it i need to put
16:56 - on here to now
17:00 - is correct so let's do this for the
17:03 - other costumes
17:04 - as well let's put this one here
17:08 - and then here on this
17:12 - dot on the center
17:17 - okay the last step is we are gonna write
17:21 - two more
17:21 - ifs for a second and for a minute i
17:25 - recommend you to stop
17:27 - the video and try by yourself first
17:32 - make it easier i'm going to
17:35 - duplicate this one
17:39 - and put it here and duplicate one more
17:42 - time
17:43 - and put it here and then i'm gonna
17:45 - modify it
17:46 - so when custom name is
17:50 - minute and when custom name is
17:54 - our
17:57 - so for a minute i'm gonna point in
18:00 - direction
18:01 - current minute multiply 6
18:05 - also because the same orange lines are
18:08 - also referring to minutes as well
18:10 - but for hours we only have
18:14 - 12 numbers so
18:20 - 360 degrees the whole circle
18:23 - divided by 12 numbers
18:26 - of the hours on the clock the blue ones
18:31 - is going to be 30 degrees
18:35 - rotation so between this blue line
18:38 - and the other one is 30 degrees rotation
18:41 - so
18:42 - point in direction so if the custom name
18:45 - is our
18:47 - current hour multiply
18:51 - 30. so if i start
18:54 - is showing 11 57
19:00 - which is the same
19:03 - as the clock on my computer if you look
19:07 - here
19:08 - you see these are the same thing
19:11 - it was such an interesting project with
19:14 - a lot of
19:15 - learning inside it i hope you liked this
