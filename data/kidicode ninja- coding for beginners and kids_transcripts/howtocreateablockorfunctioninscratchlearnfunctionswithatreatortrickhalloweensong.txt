00:00 - hello hello hello you love these
00:02 - scratchers how are you doing
00:04 - i hope you are all feeling wonderful
00:07 - i have something very exciting for you
00:11 - in this tutorial we are going to learn
00:14 - about
00:15 - functions with a trick or treat song
00:20 - let's go trick or treating
00:22 - [Music]
00:27 - let's start writing
00:29 - let's listen to a song and see why it's
00:33 - so easy to remember this song and how we
00:36 - can help our computer to learn it as
00:39 - easy as us
00:41 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:44 - learn to code and have fun
00:47 - like traitor trick who are you
00:50 - i'm a ghost i'm a little ghost
00:55 - knight
00:55 - trick to
00:57 - are you
00:58 - i'm a ghost
01:00 - i'm a little ghost
01:04 - knight chittor chick who are you
01:07 - i'm a monster i'm a little monster night
01:12 - night trader treat blue are you
01:15 - i'm a monster i'm a little monster i
01:20 - like trick or treat who are you
01:24 - i'm a witch i'm a little witch
01:28 - knick-knack trick-or-treat who are you
01:32 - i'm a witch
01:34 - i'm a little
01:38 - [Music]
01:40 - i'm a cowboy i'm a little cowboy
01:44 - nike
01:46 - who are you
01:48 - i'm a cowboy i'm a little cowboy
01:57 - [Music]
02:06 - a little
02:11 - who are you
02:13 - i'm a pirate i'm a little pirate knight
02:17 - like trick-or-treat who are you
02:21 - i'm a pirate i'm a little pirate
02:26 - the reason learning this song was so
02:28 - easy was because a lot of the parts were
02:32 - just repeating themselves so look at
02:34 - this
02:37 - and this
02:38 - see the highlighted part so the first
02:41 - one
02:42 - i'm a ghost i'm a cowboy
02:45 - this only the word ghost cowboy
02:50 - the witch
02:51 - the monster
02:53 - the ballerina the pirate are the parts
02:56 - that are being changed but the rest of
02:58 - the song
03:00 - repeats itself in all
03:03 - different parts of the song
03:06 - so
03:07 - how can i write it in the computer
03:10 - language much simpler than repeating it
03:14 - there is something called functions or
03:16 - in scratch it's block
03:19 - that helps us
03:21 - write the things that have a repetitive
03:24 - patterns and we
03:26 - instead of repeating ourself we write it
03:29 - once and then we can reuse it
03:32 - now let's go here
03:36 - i rewrote this song
03:39 - and then i took off
03:41 - the costumes like the ghost the pirate
03:45 - the ballerina
03:46 - and instead i named it a hollow incasto
03:51 - now with this only one paragraph
03:55 - and changing this to a parameter named
03:58 - halloween costume
04:02 - i'm creating this sign but instead of
04:04 - repeating it
04:06 - multiple times
04:08 - i'm only changing this part to a
04:11 - parameter let's see one example of
04:14 - writing such a thing in scratch
04:19 - now let's see how we can use functions
04:22 - or blocks in scratch
04:25 - first of all let's import a few costumes
04:32 - in our song we had ballerina
04:39 - we had
04:40 - ghost
04:51 - for the purpose of demo i only
04:54 - show two but of course you can add as
04:56 - much as you want after you see how easy
04:59 - it's going to be
05:00 - with using blocks
05:03 - now let's go to blocks here on the left
05:07 - i click on my blogs
05:09 - and now i'm gonna create
05:11 - a new blog that can generate that song
05:15 - i'm gonna name it it's always a good
05:17 - idea to name our
05:20 - functions or blogs as if it's a verb
05:23 - like you're saying do something
05:26 - now i'm gonna say
05:28 - sing
05:30 - treat
05:32 - or
05:34 - treat
05:35 - song
05:39 - and i also wanted to have
05:42 - an input
05:44 - remember we had
05:46 - something being changed in our song
05:48 - which was that costume once was i'm a
05:51 - little ghost and then i'm a little
05:54 - pirate i'm a little ballerina
05:58 - so here my input is gonna be
06:02 - kids
06:04 - costume
06:06 - and i say okay
06:09 - now this function can be defined under
06:12 - this like i'm going to define a very
06:15 - simple function
06:17 - so just that i'm showing the idea of
06:20 - using functions
06:22 - let's say the function is supposed to
06:25 - write the lyrics of that song
06:29 - i'm gonna grab a couple of says
06:35 - like this
06:38 - night
06:41 - night
06:50 - trick or
06:52 - treat
06:53 - so this is the part that is fixed
06:57 - who are you
07:00 - and then here we have
07:02 - i mil
07:05 - little
07:06 - now this part is something that is going
07:09 - to be changed so this is the important
07:12 - part the part that is a parameter and
07:15 - it's being changed all i have to do is
07:19 - let me zoom it
07:21 - all i have to do is
07:24 - to drag
07:26 - this part
07:28 - here
07:31 - so what happens is whenever here i'm
07:33 - defining a function whenever i'm calling
07:37 - the function i can pass a value to this
07:41 - parameter
07:43 - sounds complex but don't worry in a
07:45 - minute you will see how easy it is
07:50 - now let's say if i click here
07:56 - when it gets to the kids costume i'm a
07:59 - little
08:00 - it's a zero because it doesn't yet know
08:02 - what it is so now i need to call the
08:05 - function and pass
08:07 - the parameter
08:09 - to call the function
08:11 - is very easy
08:13 - i'm gonna say
08:15 - have an event to trigger it
08:17 - when this sprite clicked
08:20 - now i say sing trick or treat song
08:25 - now for the ballerina
08:27 - with the kids costume of ballerina
08:32 - now let's see what happened i'm gonna
08:34 - click here
08:36 - knock knock knock trick or treat i'm a
08:39 - little ballerina
08:42 - now
08:43 - very easily
08:46 - i can
08:47 - use this for the ghost or for as many
08:53 - function many costumes or like a spice
08:57 - carrot kids costume or sprite here in
08:59 - scratch that we have and we can create a
09:02 - very
09:04 - interesting animation only
09:07 - because of using function very easily
09:11 - now i copy this here
09:15 - and i copied this here as well
09:19 - and then when i go to the ghost
09:25 - let me copy this again to make sure i
09:28 - got it
09:30 - okay
09:30 - now that i'm on the ghost
09:38 - all i need to do is
09:44 - the function is already defined i'm
09:46 - calling the function
09:48 - and now i'm passing the parameter ghost
09:53 - so here
09:55 - if i click
09:57 - this i'm not connected i'm a little
10:00 - ghost
10:03 - that's it with this our life is going to
10:06 - be much much easier you see all the
10:08 - blocks that you have are the functions
10:11 - that are already created by
10:14 - scratch but here you can create your own
10:17 - your own customized functions
10:20 - and
10:22 - make your life much easier happy
10:24 - halloween
