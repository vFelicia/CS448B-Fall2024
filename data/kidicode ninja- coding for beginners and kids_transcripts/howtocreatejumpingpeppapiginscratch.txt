00:00 - i've got something very exciting for you
00:03 - in this video we're going to learn to
00:05 - program in scratch
00:07 - with peppa pig hi
00:11 - i'm eddie i'm peppa pig
00:14 - and this is your place to learn to code
00:16 - and have fun
00:19 - in this tutorial peppa pig and i
00:23 - are going to teach you how to make a
00:25 - character
00:26 - jump in scratch let's dive in
00:34 - all right so we're going to make peppa
00:36 - pig jump like the video that you just
00:39 - saw so let's go to scratch.mit.edu and
00:44 - then we click on create
00:54 - okay so we are going to create a
00:58 - peppa pig that jumps like the video that
01:01 - we just saw
01:03 - before this so we go to scratch.mit dot
01:08 - edu and then let's give our project
01:12 - a name jump
01:16 - pink
01:21 - peppa pig
01:26 - all right we
01:29 - need a sprite
01:32 - for that i've already downloaded a peppa
01:36 - pig
01:37 - sprite so i'm gonna upload it from my
01:39 - computer when you wanted to download
01:41 - search for peppa pig
01:44 - png transparent so
01:48 - you search for import it
01:52 - first so you need to search for
01:58 - peppa pig png
02:02 - transparent background and then
02:06 - you can find it in any of this links
02:12 - all right so i have this character here
02:17 - and then i'm going to the costumes
02:23 - i duplicate it and then
02:28 - i'm gonna create two variations so
02:31 - one more variation i delete the hands
02:37 - and i'm gonna draw a different hands
02:42 - pointing upwards
02:45 - so i take this pen and then go into the
02:49 - feel
02:50 - i take this i pick the color from here
02:54 - and now that i have my color i draw a
02:57 - two different hands pointing upwards
03:02 - so now i have this and i have this
03:05 - all right into the code
03:10 - so let's see the video in slow motion
03:15 - once more and see what we should do
03:18 - it is going upwards on the y
03:22 - direction and then coming downwards on
03:25 - the y direction so
03:27 - a few steps up why few steps down
03:30 - so we can write it like
03:33 - this from the motions
03:39 - i can say
03:42 - change y by
03:45 - 10 so it's like it's moving 10 10
03:49 - 1 2 3 4 5 10 upwards
03:53 - and then to go downward i needed to go
03:57 - change y by
04:00 - -10 and since it's jumping up and down
04:04 - repeatedly every movement is being
04:07 - repeated so i go to control
04:11 - and then repeat 10 times going upwards
04:15 - repeat 10 times going downward
04:21 - let's see so it goes up
04:24 - down up down i don't want to keep
04:27 - clicking
04:28 - so i put a forever loop as well around
04:31 - it
04:32 - so that this is gonna be happening
04:34 - forever
04:36 - i don't need to kick anymore so i stop
04:41 - and then i want to make sure when i
04:44 - start the piggy is
04:45 - in the middle of the
04:48 - scene so i go to the
04:52 - motion and i say
04:57 - so when i put it here the location of
05:00 - the x
05:01 - and y is already written for me so i say
05:04 - go to this location first and then do
05:08 - existing
05:11 - i can make the piggy the peppa pig
05:15 - move by clicking on the start
05:19 - so i can say when start clicked
05:22 - i can also make it move
05:26 - with pressing any key that i want but i
05:28 - choose this
05:29 - so when fly clicked
05:33 - go up down up down up down
05:36 - let's put a backdrop as well
05:40 - i'm gonna choose
05:47 - this one and then
05:53 - also let's make it make a
05:57 - noise or sound or something so i go to
06:00 - the sounds
06:03 - and so you can go from here and choose
06:07 - whatever sound that you want i go here i
06:10 - search for a sound
06:14 - let's go to animals and see what is the
06:17 - most
06:18 - relevant
06:22 - this one
06:25 - we don't have exactly the
06:29 - pick sounds we can download it from
06:31 - internet or you can
06:32 - record it by yourself but
06:38 - this might be fun so i'm gonna
06:41 - import this and then here
06:46 - now that i have it i would say
06:51 - start sound or
06:55 - yeah start this
06:59 - you can of course play with this and
07:02 - make it
07:02 - more similar to the one that is in the
07:05 - actual video
07:06 - but it's just for the demo so let's see
07:12 - what if i put it inside the repeat so
07:15 - that we hear it more often
07:18 - so i'm gonna drag it inside
07:25 - much better so
07:32 - comment in the description what do you
07:34 - think we can do to make it
07:36 - better what things we can add to this
07:38 - project
07:39 - and feel free to go to this i'm gonna
07:42 - put the link
07:43 - to the project in the scratch website
07:45 - and feel free to go there and remix it
07:47 - and share your projects
