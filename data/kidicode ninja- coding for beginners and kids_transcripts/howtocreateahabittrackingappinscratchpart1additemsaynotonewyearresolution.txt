00:00 - happy new year to all the awesome kitty
00:03 - code ninja
00:03 - gangs and this time of the year everyone
00:06 - is talking about
00:08 - new year resolutions sadly
00:11 - new year resolutions they don't work
00:15 - but the good news is habits
00:19 - they work if you stick to certain habits
00:22 - every day eventually we can achieve
00:26 - our goals but how are we gonna track it
00:29 - we need an application for that
00:32 - so i decided to create a tutorial
00:35 - on create an application for tracking
00:39 - our daily habits let's dive in
00:42 - hello and welcome to another keycode
00:43 - ninja tutorial this is eddie and this is
00:45 - your place to learn to go and have fun
00:47 - are you ready open
00:51 - all right so we go to scratch.mit.edu
00:57 - and then we
00:58 - click on create
01:05 - okay what we can do is in order to
01:08 - create
01:09 - a habit list is we can use
01:14 - variables before that let's give our
01:16 - project a name
01:18 - habit list all right so we go to
01:22 - variables
01:23 - and there is something called lists
01:27 - so let's click on make a list
01:30 - and i name it my habit
01:34 - list okay
01:38 - now i have the habit list here
01:43 - and let's say when
01:47 - start clicked or like when fly clicked
01:54 - go to the sensing and here it says
01:59 - ask what's your name and wait change the
02:02 - question to
02:03 - ask what shall i do
02:08 - with the list
02:13 - so a question is being asked and then
02:16 - based
02:16 - on the answer i'm gonna do something
02:19 - with the list so it's a list
02:24 - we can add something to the list or we
02:26 - can delete
02:27 - something from the list so
02:31 - let's write the condition for add and if
02:35 - the answer was at something should be
02:38 - added here
02:39 - so let's go to control
02:43 - and then drag a dragon if
02:46 - then block
02:50 - and then we go to sensing
02:56 - to the operator to
02:59 - check the answer so we drag the one
03:02 - with equal
03:06 - and then i go to sensing
03:10 - so here there is a question and then
03:12 - there is a variable
03:14 - for answers so i drag this
03:19 - so if answer was had
03:24 - [Music]
03:26 - then
03:29 - this time ask again
03:33 - what shall i add
03:37 - so what
03:44 - shall i add and then
03:47 - to use the answer
03:52 - we go to variable
03:55 - and then there is the item there is a
03:58 - block of code add
04:00 - thing to my habit list
04:04 - and we replace this with answer
04:10 - so answer answer
04:13 - which is here
04:17 - so what happens is we first ask what
04:19 - we're gonna do with the list
04:22 - if the answer was at then we check what
04:25 - are
04:26 - what are we gonna add and then whatever
04:28 - was the answer
04:29 - will be added to the list so if i play
04:31 - start first
04:33 - it's asking what shall i do with the
04:35 - list
04:36 - and then i say at again i see
04:40 - what shall i add so an item of
04:43 - my daily habit is maybe
04:47 - code 20 min
04:51 - and then i click the check mark
04:56 - code 10 code 20 minutes
05:00 - is added so this one i've added before
05:04 - uh in order to be able to
05:08 - add more items
05:11 - so i need it to be able to repeat it
05:15 - forever
05:16 - so i put it in a loop from control
05:24 - so i put everything within the
05:28 - forever loop so now
05:31 - if i stop and i press start
05:34 - what shall i do add
05:38 - what shall i add um
05:43 - exercise exer
05:46 - [Music]
05:50 - size
05:55 - so my mistake was i didn't put the ask
05:58 - inside so i
06:03 - bring the ask inside as well
06:06 - so that i can repeat i can
06:09 - ask more questions
06:13 - so what shall i do with the list again
06:16 - add
06:18 - what shall i add eat
06:21 - healthy food
06:25 - i can drag this so that i can see the
06:28 - whole thing and i can repeat and repeat
06:31 - but then how am i gonna check it off
06:35 - from the list maybe by asking the
06:38 - question
06:38 - of uh by answering the question to
06:41 - delete
06:42 - instead of the ad
06:45 - on the next tutorial we're gonna see how
06:48 - we can delete
