00:00 - [Music]
00:12 - hello and welcome to another cuticle
00:14 - ninja tutorial this
00:16 - is ellie and this is your place to learn
00:19 - to
00:20 - code and have fun in this video
00:24 - peppa pig's fish friend is gliding back
00:27 - home
00:27 - and peppa pig needs to jump into the
00:29 - fish tank to be able to meet his fish
00:32 - friend
00:32 - now we are going to see how we can make
00:35 - peppa pig jump
00:36 - into the fish tank so that they can
00:39 - reunite let's dive in
00:44 - what we need for this is a
00:47 - sprite i specifically choose
00:50 - peppa pig because i like it
00:54 - and if you want to see how to
00:58 - import it and make it jump watch my
01:01 - previous video that the link is in the
01:03 - description i'm gonna quickly show it
01:05 - here but for more details
01:07 - you can watch the previous video so i've
01:10 - already
01:11 - have my sprite you can actually use any
01:14 - sprite that you like
01:15 - but it's just my choice
01:21 - so instead i'm not going to use this cat
01:27 - i'm gonna quickly
01:30 - create a different costume for it as
01:33 - well
01:35 - by deleting the hands
01:39 - and drawing a different
01:45 - the same hand pointing upward actually
01:50 - so like this
01:53 - so i have two customs
01:57 - and then
02:06 - one more which is
02:10 - the fish bowl
02:18 - and the backdrop as well
02:25 - actually not upload but just choose the
02:29 - search
02:32 - and any simple backdrop
02:35 - with work it's just the matter of
02:38 - choice
02:45 - yes
02:49 - the simple one
02:52 - and then peppa pig should fit in this so
02:56 - i'm gonna make it triple size
03:02 - which looks a good fit
03:07 - so first thing making the peppa pig
03:11 - jump i've already explained this in the
03:13 - previous video so i'm just quickly
03:14 - bringing it up without saying anything
03:17 - the jump is that we repeat 10 times
03:20 - moving
03:20 - upwards by changing y and
03:24 - 10 times going downwards by changing y
03:27 - to a
03:28 - minus value and it's controlled by
03:30 - pressing space key so
03:32 - if i press space it goes so i'm just
03:36 - like pressing the space key it goes up
03:37 - and down
03:39 - now let's get to the fish what i want to
03:43 - be done with the fish is
03:48 - i want it to start from here
03:52 - and then i want it to glide all over to
03:54 - the end
03:57 - so in order to do that
04:01 - when the start is clicked
04:05 - i want it to be in the initial position
04:09 - of the this one
04:13 - what happens with positioning is if i
04:17 - put it here put the sprite here and then
04:20 - i click
04:20 - on the code here the position is already
04:23 - updated to whatever i want
04:24 - now i want it to glide to the left side
04:27 - of the screen
04:28 - so i drag it here when i drag it
04:32 - the position is also updated here but
04:35 - then
04:36 - i need the code for gliding
04:40 - so glide one second
04:46 - to this location
04:49 - and i want it to be not in one second
04:51 - but i want it to be maybe
04:53 - five seconds so that i give the peak
04:56 - enough time to jump and show the various
05:00 - things that we want to happen
05:03 - so i'm going to press start so that we
05:05 - see what's going on
05:15 - didn't glide for some reason
05:21 - because this location is not
05:25 - correct so i drag it here
05:29 - now i see the correct one the minus one
05:32 - so this one should be
05:34 - minus now let's see what's happening
05:38 - i press start the fish is
05:41 - gliding and peppa is jumping but now
05:45 - what we want is first thing i don't want
05:49 - the fish to glide only once i want it to
05:51 - repeat forever
05:53 - so that it looks like it's constantly
05:56 - coming
05:59 - so i put four over here
06:04 - now it's like this pepper can
06:08 - jump up but then i want the
06:12 - the pepper to go inside the fish bowl so
06:15 - that can meet the fish
06:18 - in order to do that let's see what we
06:20 - can do
06:22 - i'm clicking on the peppa again
06:26 - so that i can modify this a little bit
06:29 - more
06:29 - so what i want is
06:32 - when i press the space bar
06:37 - the pepper jumps but then i would
06:41 - the peak should try to go in the bowl so
06:44 - how do i know it using sensing so i
06:47 - would say
06:49 - when i put a
06:52 - if condition
06:58 - an if then condition
07:11 - i want this change to be out
07:17 - so out
07:21 - come on okay so
07:24 - if
07:28 - sensing guess what i want to sense
07:31 - if sensing
07:35 - touching color so if it's sensing the
07:38 - color
07:38 - of the fish or something in the fishbowl
07:43 - i don't want this color because i stop
07:46 - this
07:46 - and what i'm going to do is i
07:50 - pick that
07:53 - color picker and then i put it on the
07:57 - fish
07:59 - so when if it's touching this color
08:02 - then i broadcast a message
08:10 - broadcasting is on the event so i
08:13 - broadcast
08:16 - a message a new message
08:21 - in the bowl
08:26 - in a minute you will see why i'm doing
08:29 - it
08:31 - so i have an event
08:36 - broadcast in the bowl
08:41 - so this is what we have
08:45 - so far
08:48 - just like this
08:52 - so we already broadcasted
08:56 - if touching color broadcast in the bowl
09:00 - so i assume that the pepper
09:02 - has jumped inside the bowl and is
09:05 - touching the fish
09:06 - this color which is the fish now i want
09:10 - the fish to react to it so i go to the
09:12 - fish and then i write a block of code a
09:16 - piece of code
09:17 - for when i receive that
09:20 - in the bowl if i receive it i want
09:25 - first i want the custom of this
09:28 - fishbowl be changed to this one
09:31 - so that it looks like the pepper is
09:35 - covering the fish or is replacing the
09:38 - fish
09:41 - so first thing on the looks
09:45 - switch costume to
09:49 - the fishbowl b
09:52 - and then a small weight
09:58 - um maybe half a second
10:06 - and then switching back to the custom
10:08 - that originally was so
10:11 - the fish should be appeared again
10:14 - i go look switch custom to
10:19 - the stein fishbowl
10:22 - a and also when it goes in the water i
10:26 - want to also make a sound
10:30 - of like plunge
10:35 - so i search for it
10:38 - [Music]
10:40 - and then i add it to my sounds when it's
10:43 - added now i can drag the code
10:48 - play sound time until done
10:54 - so let's give it a test
10:58 - so i play space bar i need to be careful
11:02 - to
11:03 - try to hit the ball
11:07 - okay something is not working let's see
11:10 - what is
11:11 - not okay
11:14 - the
11:20 - is because the peak is behind this so
11:24 - initial state right away when
11:28 - start clicked i want the fishbowl to be
11:33 - on the front so i say
11:40 - i can either say show or go to the
11:43 - front layer it
11:46 - might be better
11:51 - okay so if i press start
11:55 - you see when he's touching the fish
11:58 - [Music]
12:00 - it's making the difference
12:03 - like the water jump waters splashing
12:06 - sound
12:08 - so when i press start
12:11 - i can jump and then if i jump quick
12:14 - enough to touch the fish
12:16 - it makes the sound that i want it
12:19 - and the fish disappears
12:25 - so only make sure that this location is
12:28 - uh down enough so that when it's jumping
12:31 - down it's touching the fish or you can
12:34 - adjust it in the code as well if you
12:36 - like the video don't forget to
12:38 - like subscribe and hit the bell so that
12:40 - you won't miss the next tutorial see you
12:42 - next week
