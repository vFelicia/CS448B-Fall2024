00:01 - hey sami what are you doing hey i'm
00:03 - writing christmas cards by my friends
00:05 - oh really yeah that's really cool have
00:07 - you considered creating your own card in
00:09 - scratch can we do that
00:11 - yes you can join me in this tutorial to
00:13 - show you how we can create our own card
00:15 - in scratch
00:18 - hello and welcome to kirikou ninja
00:20 - tutorials
00:21 - this is ellie and this is your place to
00:24 - learn to code and have fun
00:29 - let's see how we can craft an
00:32 - amazing animated christmas card in
00:34 - scratch
00:36 - in order to do that we open our browser
00:39 - we navigate to scratch.mit.edu
00:44 - and from here
00:50 - we click on create from
00:54 - the left corner
01:01 - and then after the page was loaded
01:05 - it's always a good habit to give our
01:08 - projects
01:08 - a meaningful name so i
01:12 - give it the name christmas card
01:19 - dash card
01:22 - and then i get rid of the things that i
01:24 - do not need so i delete this
01:28 - we are going to create the christmas
01:31 - card like the physical card
01:33 - using backdrop so i choose two backdrops
01:36 - i create two backdrops for
01:39 - the open and closed versions of the card
01:43 - so
01:43 - i go here on the backdrop and because
01:47 - it's a custom
01:48 - made backdrop which does not exist
01:51 - on the pre-existing backdrops of the
01:54 - scratch
01:55 - i go to the paint so that i can draw my
01:58 - own
01:59 - card so i go to the paint
02:03 - and then i choose
02:06 - the color of my card because it's
02:09 - christmas
02:10 - i'm gonna create a green and red card
02:14 - so i click on the color and then i play
02:18 - with this
02:18 - to see the color i like now this is what
02:22 - i want
02:24 - now i click on the rectangle
02:28 - i draw a rectangle
02:32 - and then i click on the pointer to get
02:36 - out of that
02:38 - so i need one more rectangle as well
02:42 - i want the the other rectangle to be red
02:45 - so i change the color i choose a new
02:48 - color
02:50 - red red red
02:54 - and then i draw another rectangle which
02:58 - is about the same size so
03:03 - i draw one more
03:07 - now i'm gonna move this a bit
03:10 - here i want to make it look like that
03:13 - is a card that is halfway opened
03:17 - so i click on this
03:21 - reshape icon here
03:24 - and then i'm gonna drag the corners a
03:26 - bit upward
03:28 - and a bit upward here the same on this
03:32 - one
03:35 - then i'm gonna put this edges
03:40 - on each other so now i have a card
03:43 - that looks like looks like is halfway
03:46 - opened what else i'm gonna do
03:51 - is i duplicate this
03:54 - now i have two backdrops i can give them
03:59 - a better name so for this one
04:03 - i say closed
04:07 - card and for this one
04:10 - i'm gonna say opened
04:14 - cart so it makes more sense rather than
04:18 - be
04:18 - backdrop two or three or numbers
04:22 - now i see the change is applied here
04:27 - okay now let's play with this one and
04:30 - make it look
04:31 - like it's an opened card so i click on
04:34 - the reshape
04:37 - and then i'm gonna flip this
04:40 - over so that it looks like it's an
04:43 - opened card
04:51 - something like this
04:55 - and this one i reshape it
04:59 - a bit
05:02 - that's pretty much what i want
05:07 - let's add a couple of sprites as well
05:11 - so i go to this one
05:15 - and then i click
05:20 - on this price and i'm gonna create
05:23 - my own text based
05:26 - sprite using paint
05:29 - so i click on the paint
05:33 - and then i'm gonna write
05:39 - i using a color of my
05:43 - choice i'm gonna
05:46 - write here
05:51 - click here to
05:54 - open and then using
05:59 - this one i'm gonna draw
06:05 - an arrow
06:08 - okay and then i
06:12 - change the font to something
06:16 - that i like better
06:20 - i like this one because it's more like a
06:23 - handwriting
06:29 - and then i'm gonna select them all
06:34 - i use this one and then i
06:38 - uh drag it around it drag my mouse
06:40 - around it
06:41 - and then after everything is selected
06:44 - i choose group
06:48 - now everything moves together so it
06:50 - looks like everything
06:51 - is only one sprite
06:55 - and then i'm gonna put it on top of my
07:00 - card
07:04 - i like it better if it's white
07:08 - so i'm gonna change the color to
07:13 - something at least lighter
07:19 - so white so that it looks better here
07:23 - now we are going to write
07:27 - a code to operate
07:31 - the action of opening and closing the
07:33 - card
07:35 - first of all i want the initial state of
07:38 - the card to be
07:39 - closed so i want at the start
07:43 - of the project the card be on the close
07:47 - card backdrop so i go to the backdrops
07:51 - and then i click on the code
07:56 - and i say from the events when
08:00 - start clicked
08:03 - and then from the looks switch backdrop
08:07 - to closed card
08:11 - in this case i'm
08:15 - certain that at the initial
08:18 - state the card is always closed
08:23 - so if i click start i see that the card
08:27 - is closed
08:30 - now the second thing i'm gonna do is i'm
08:33 - gonna write a code
08:34 - so that when i click on this
08:37 - arrow or this sentence the whole thing
08:41 - is one sprite
08:43 - the card is switching to the opened
08:46 - condition and so
08:50 - i go to the events and then i choose
08:55 - when this sprite is clicked
09:00 - i zoom it so that you can see
09:03 - so when this sprite is clicked
09:07 - i want to switch to backdrop
09:11 - which is the opened backdrop so i go to
09:15 - the looks
09:16 - and then i say switch backdrop to
09:20 - opened cart so i click to see what
09:23 - happens
09:25 - when i click here the ba and the card is
09:28 - open
09:29 - but also after the card opens
09:32 - is opened i don't want to see this one
09:35 - anymore
09:36 - so from the looks i can
09:39 - choose height
09:48 - so if i click here now the card is
09:51 - opened and i do not see
09:53 - that uh sentence anymore
09:57 - one more thing is one more thing that i
10:01 - need to write here
10:02 - is that when the card is closed
10:06 - and right away after i click the start
10:08 - at the very beginning i want to make
10:11 - sure that arrow
10:12 - and the sentence is showing up so right
10:14 - here
10:16 - i would go to the events and say
10:19 - when start clicked
10:22 - now i say show
10:26 - so i'm sure that when i click the start
10:29 - this one is showed up so now the card is
10:32 - closed
10:33 - on the initial state this one is shown
10:36 - as well
10:39 - now we need to add more stuff on the
10:41 - opened
10:42 - card so
10:46 - i click on the sprite
10:50 - and then i just choose one of the
10:53 - pre-made
10:55 - sprites but you can really do
10:58 - choose whatever you want um
11:02 - i just i search for winter
11:07 - and then this snowman comes up
11:11 - i choose this
11:16 - now i drag this snowman
11:19 - onto the card
11:23 - and i want it to be hidden when i'm
11:26 - on the closed card and i want it to be
11:29 - shown when i switch to
11:31 - the opened card backdrop so
11:35 - so initially
11:38 - when start is clicked
11:42 - i don't want it to be here what i can do
11:46 - is
11:48 - i can say initially when start is
11:51 - clicked
11:52 - i broadcast a message
11:56 - which can be done from the events
12:02 - broadcast message a new message
12:08 - is hide snowman
12:16 - so
12:23 - i drag it here so what i expect is
12:29 - uh is when i kick the start i broadcast
12:32 - hide the snowman so now i go to the
12:34 - snowman
12:35 - and then i say when i
12:38 - receive hide the snowman
12:42 - i would hide
12:46 - so i drag this now let's test it
12:49 - i click start now you see at the initial
12:52 - state i don't have it
12:54 - now i click open the snowman is not here
12:58 - so
12:58 - now i need to need it to be shown
13:01 - again i go to
13:06 - the sprite
13:12 - and then on top of when this sprite is
13:14 - clicked
13:15 - switch to open card
13:18 - again another broadcast message
13:22 - which is broadcast
13:25 - new message not this sign
13:29 - show snowman
13:34 - so i drag it here
13:43 - let's test and see what happens okay i
13:46 - set the
13:47 - show to snowman but i didn't add it to
13:49 - the stomach so i go to the snowman
13:52 - again when i receive the show
13:56 - snowman
14:01 - now this time show
14:06 - when i receive show snowman show from
14:09 - the looks
14:10 - let's click again initial state i click
14:14 - here
14:14 - the snowman shows up
14:18 - uh i can add something else to make it
14:21 - more
14:22 - interesting which is on
14:25 - after the show i can say
14:28 - say
14:32 - merry christmas
14:38 - for two seconds or maybe even more
14:43 - four seconds not testing it
14:46 - i click here it says merry christmas
14:52 - let's do one last thing which is adding
14:55 - a song so that when the card is opened
14:58 - is musical card
15:00 - in order to do that i go to the sounds i
15:03 - click here
15:05 - and search i go
15:08 - to the loops
15:12 - and i choose
15:15 - something like
15:20 - this one preferably you can record the
15:23 - christmas song or something
15:24 - if you're artistic but otherwise you can
15:27 - choose something that exists here
15:30 - now i go back to the code and then from
15:33 - the
15:34 - sounds i say play sound until done
15:39 - now let's test it again
15:43 - [Music]
15:46 - uh so you see that there is a force
15:48 - against the delay before the card is
15:51 - the song is placed so i just slapped
15:53 - these two so that
15:54 - it starts playing right away so again
15:58 - i click and then after
16:01 - a bit i will see these messages coming
16:08 - so we're done with this tutorial hurry
