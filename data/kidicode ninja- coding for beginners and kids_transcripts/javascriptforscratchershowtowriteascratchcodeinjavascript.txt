00:00 - hello everyone what's up i hope you are
00:02 - all feeling
00:03 - wonderful i'm very excited today today
00:07 - i'm gonna collaborate with chris
00:09 - from one of the most popular scratch
00:11 - tutorial channels on youtube
00:13 - which is coding with chris
00:18 - if you've been doing scratch for a while
00:20 - most probably you have already came
00:22 - across this channel
00:23 - if not i'm gonna put the link to his
00:25 - channel on the description below
00:27 - make sure to go there and check it out i
00:29 - really encourage you to go there and
00:31 - check it out and subscribe
00:33 - it's full of really cool tutorials what
00:36 - i love most about his channel is that
00:38 - over there you can
00:39 - learn to create existing
00:42 - games and lots of cool stuff like big
00:45 - projects
00:46 - and you can put into practice whatever
00:49 - you've learned here
00:50 - or anywhere else about scratch
00:54 - welcome to kirikou ninja tutorial this
00:57 - is eddie and this is your place to learn
01:00 - to code and have fun
01:02 - hello to the scratchers on earth how are
01:04 - you guys doing today hope you're all
01:05 - doing fantastic uh but today's video is
01:07 - going to be a little bit of javascript
01:09 - and a little bit of
01:10 - scratch so we're going to compare the
01:11 - two and see how
01:13 - they compare all right so stick around
01:15 - to learn a little bit recently
01:17 - i've been having so much fun with
01:20 - scratch programming i made games
01:22 - animation lots of really cool things
01:25 - you know what i love most about it it
01:27 - was that i didn't need to
01:29 - type a lot of things most things were
01:31 - blocks of code i could drag
01:33 - them put them together and tada a cool
01:36 - project was made
01:38 - so easy so much fun but then
01:42 - i was wondering what if i want to do
01:45 - something more what if i want to make a
01:47 - more powerful
01:48 - program like a web application a game
01:51 - that i can solve
01:52 - something that i can share it with the
01:54 - whole world but not only with scratch
01:57 - community
01:58 - then i had a chat with chris and we
02:01 - decided to give it a try
02:04 - we decided to write the same program in
02:06 - scratch
02:07 - and in javascript to see how it would
02:10 - look
02:10 - like if you want to transition from
02:13 - scratch programming
02:14 - to a more real programming language
02:19 - if you two are on the same boat join us
02:22 - in this video to see
02:23 - how we convert a code from scratch
02:27 - to javascript let's dive in let's say
02:30 - when i have a counter
02:32 - that counts from
02:35 - 0 to 10.
02:40 - i'm gonna delete this cat it's always
02:43 - there i don't want it so
02:46 - first thing i need a variable to use it
02:50 - as a counter i'm going to create a
02:52 - variable
02:54 - i make a variable i name it i
02:58 - so there is a counter here i can click
03:01 - here
03:02 - to make it bigger version
03:05 - so what i'm gonna do is i start from
03:08 - zero
03:09 - so i set i to zero
03:14 - and then
03:18 - i'm going to repeat something 10 times
03:22 - so i'm going to say repeat until
03:26 - a condition is met
03:30 - what i want to happen what i want to do
03:33 - is
03:34 - i'm increasing this number so i would
03:38 - say
03:39 - change i by 1
03:45 - and before changing i want to show the
03:48 - eyes well and also i need to set the
03:53 - condition
03:54 - to clarify how many times i want it to
03:58 - happen so i go to operator
04:03 - if i want it to go until 10
04:07 - so i say repeat this until
04:10 - i is
04:15 - until you get to the point that i is
04:17 - more than 9 so i drag
04:19 - this
04:23 - and then i put i here
04:26 - from variable and nine
04:30 - so if i count from zero to nine
04:35 - it's gonna
04:39 - repeat this show variable and change
04:42 - change by 1 10 times what happens
04:46 - is this number is changed super quickly
04:49 - so i'm gonna put weights in between so
04:52 - that i can see
04:54 - the changes so i
04:57 - show i wait and i also put a weight here
05:01 - so that i see so i'm clicking here so
05:04 - that i can see the changes
05:05 - every one second this number is being
05:09 - changed chris can you show
05:14 - us how would it look like if i want to
05:17 - write this
05:18 - in javascript all right ellie so
05:22 - you just created basically a counter so
05:24 - and i need to do that
05:25 - in uh javascript uh so i'm gonna
05:28 - actually
05:28 - change my uh environment you guys can
05:31 - also
05:32 - go and follow this uh website uh it's
05:34 - called playcode.io
05:36 - it's a good place to do javascript if
05:38 - you're just getting started because
05:40 - one good thing that it has it has this
05:41 - kind of live feature where i can just
05:43 - kind of do things
05:44 - i can see things live and this console
05:48 - part is basically where we're going to
05:50 - see the result now it's
05:51 - not as visual as you know
05:55 - scratch you guys probably already know
05:57 - that javascript and this kind of
05:58 - language
05:59 - normally are not as visual but anyways
06:01 - let's let's actually create the counter
06:03 - so
06:04 - you know inside of uh ellie's tutorial
06:08 - just now
06:08 - uh she created a variable called i but
06:11 - why do we call it an i will
06:13 - i is normally what's called an iterator
06:15 - all right
06:16 - and inside of javascript if you want to
06:18 - create a um
06:20 - a for loop basically or a repeat
06:23 - function a repeat
06:24 - loop you would want to create an
06:27 - iterator that will keep
06:28 - a a record of the count of the iteration
06:31 - so
06:31 - i'll say 4 and then we'll say
06:36 - i equals to 0 so this is where we
06:39 - actually
06:40 - declare i and then we will separate the
06:42 - next part with a
06:44 - semicolon and then here we want to say
06:46 - how long we want
06:47 - this for loop to repeat so this is a
06:50 - condition that it needs to keep in mind
06:52 - so i want to say
06:53 - repeat until i is smaller
06:56 - than um you know well
07:00 - let's do i smaller than 10 okay
07:05 - so this this is going to go until 9 but
07:07 - you're going to see in a second
07:08 - and then well what do i want to do every
07:10 - time well
07:11 - all i want to do is to what i want to do
07:15 - after each iteration i want to add one
07:17 - to i so instead of
07:19 - a javascript uh variable name
07:22 - plus plus basically does the same thing
07:24 - as
07:25 - scratch where you say change variable by
07:28 - one you know so it's the same thing this
07:31 - this
07:31 - this one thing is doing the same job as
07:34 - that and then we need to open and close
07:36 - curly braces
07:37 - and here i'm gonna do console.log
07:42 - i okay so let me go live here
07:45 - you'll see that instantly it will print
07:47 - out the
07:48 - numbers zero to nine now of course if i
07:51 - wanted to do
07:52 - one to ten all you need to do is to say
07:55 - start from one so the first i is going
07:58 - to be equal to one
07:59 - okay but then we want to do until 10
08:02 - right so there's two ways you can go
08:04 - about this
08:05 - you can either change this one to 11 so
08:07 - it will go until 10. so
08:09 - i smaller than 11 the last one would be
08:13 - 10 right
08:13 - so it's going to print until 10 or you
08:15 - could say i
08:17 - smaller or equal to 10 and then this is
08:20 - gonna
08:21 - go ahead and print the same kind of
08:23 - result for you
08:24 - all right so let's see what else ellie
08:26 - wants to teach us in scratch
08:29 - so let's try something else let's say i
08:32 - have a variable named
08:35 - h so i'm gonna make a variable
08:38 - i name it age and then
08:42 - i ask a question which is
08:48 - let's say how old
08:53 - are you
08:59 - and then i want the answer
09:02 - to be displayed here
09:09 - so again i go back to variables
09:14 - and then i'm gonna set
09:18 - the whatever the answer was
09:21 - i want to assign it to h so i
09:25 - go to
09:28 - sensing again and i'm
09:32 - dragging this here
09:36 - to activate it i can use
09:42 - when start clicked
09:48 - so
09:52 - event when start clicked
09:55 - i click start and then when it asks the
09:58 - question
10:00 - i put a number and the number shows up
10:03 - here so let's see how it looks like in
10:07 - javascript
10:09 - all right so this is another one of my
10:11 - favorite parts
10:12 - of scratch where you can actually ask
10:14 - for somebody's input
10:16 - and then there you know you can do
10:18 - something based on that input now
10:20 - having inputs is actually a part of
10:23 - almost all programming languages input
10:26 - output is basically
10:27 - like one of the basics of every
10:30 - programming language that you're going
10:31 - to learn now in javascript
10:33 - specifically in a front-end javascript
10:35 - there's many
10:36 - ways that you can get an input the
10:38 - simplest way that i can tell you that
10:40 - and that is
10:40 - the the one that is closest to um
10:44 - scratch is to use the function called
10:46 - prompt so if i write the word
10:48 - prompt here all right here i can first
10:52 - of all write a message that i want so
10:53 - i'm going to write a message like
10:55 - uh how old are you
11:00 - all right so if i run this program right
11:03 - now
11:04 - you'll see that this kind of pop-up
11:06 - window comes up and it says how old are
11:08 - you
11:08 - and i'll just kind of let's say i
11:10 - entered the age 10
11:12 - because i'm 10 years old there
11:15 - all right and then but if i you know
11:18 - click ok right now nothing really
11:20 - happens so we need to
11:22 - store this answer somewhere
11:25 - right so what i'll do here is that i'll
11:27 - say i will store this prompt into a
11:29 - variable
11:30 - h so this is how you create a variable
11:34 - let me stop this right now so that it
11:36 - doesn't kind of
11:37 - live reload so this is how you create a
11:39 - variable
11:40 - you write the keyword let
11:43 - all right and then the name of the
11:45 - variable that you want so now i have a
11:47 - variable
11:48 - h and then the value is going to be
11:51 - taken from the prompt okay so again if i
11:55 - run this right now again if i write it
11:58 - you know the h10 and click ok nothing
12:00 - happens
12:01 - because we haven't still shown the
12:04 - output so i have gotten the number
12:06 - as an input but i still need to show it
12:09 - as an output so how can we do that well
12:11 - again
12:12 - we can use the beautiful function of
12:15 - console.log
12:17 - and then here i can simply either say
12:19 - you know h
12:20 - or let's make it a little bit more
12:22 - interesting u
12:24 - r um and then we will say
12:28 - well and then the age
12:31 - and then years old
12:34 - so if i now go live again and then
12:38 - enter 10 here you can look at here here
12:41 - it says
12:42 - you are 10 years old all right now of
12:45 - course you can get creative with this
12:46 - you know like if i say h times um
12:50 - let me let me close it live if i say
12:53 - h times 365 then
12:57 - we can change this one to days and then
13:00 - this is going to tell you
13:01 - how many days old you are so if you're
13:03 - 10 right now
13:04 - you are uh 3 650 days
13:08 - old all right and you can just kind of
13:09 - play around with this variable
13:11 - as you would inside of scratch as well
13:14 - so
13:14 - you can see that there are a lot of
13:16 - similarities between
13:17 - scratch and other programming languages
13:20 - more specifically javascript
13:21 - and it is really worth it to learn all
13:24 - of these similarities before you
13:26 - actually kind of
13:28 - dive deeper into what the language is
13:30 - and and you know how you can how you can
13:32 - use it
13:33 - so the similarities are very interesting
13:35 - to learn so make sure you do that
13:37 - um so yeah this is it for for today's
13:39 - tutorial this was a great uh
13:41 - collaboration that i had with ellie
13:43 - channel she does uh tutorials from time
13:45 - to time
13:46 - specifically for younger learners so if
13:49 - you have any younger
13:50 - siblings make sure you recommend the
13:52 - channel yeah as you saw
13:54 - and as chris said most programming
13:56 - languages have
13:57 - a lot of commonalities when you learn
14:00 - one language it's going to be very easy
14:02 - to switch a different language so if
14:04 - you're a kid
14:06 - and are not comfortable with typing or
14:09 - you're just intimidated with text-based
14:11 - languages
14:12 - or you would rather see things visually
14:15 - or if you if just a scratch is enough
14:17 - for the purpose of what you want to do
14:20 - keep learning scratch keep writing code
14:23 - in scratch and whenever you need it to
14:25 - learn a different language or do more
14:27 - it's going to be very
14:28 - easy for you to learn a different
14:31 - language
14:33 - thank you so much for watching this
14:35 - video again
14:36 - i reiterate make sure to go to
14:40 - chris channel the link is on the
14:42 - description below there are lots of cool
14:44 - tutorials
14:46 - and regular live scratch tutorials
