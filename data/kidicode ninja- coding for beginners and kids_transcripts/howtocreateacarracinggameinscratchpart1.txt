00:01 - hi hi hi welcome back to another kirikou
00:03 - ninja tutorial
00:05 - in this tutorial we are going to create
00:07 - a car racing game
00:11 - best is eddie and this is your place to
00:14 - learn to go and have fun that's living
00:17 - okay let's get started let's give our
00:20 - project a good name
00:22 - for mola one and then
00:26 - bye-bye cat let's delete this
00:30 - cat we're gonna in we're gonna import
00:33 - the sprites that we like so you can go
00:35 - ahead and search for
00:38 - formula one top
00:43 - view and make sure you say png
00:47 - so that the background is transparent
00:54 - and then choose something and download
00:56 - it so i've already done that
00:58 - so i go ahead and upload it from
01:01 - upload sprite
01:05 - and i'm gonna download and like upload
01:08 - this
01:11 - okay
01:17 - wow it's huge let's make it like
01:21 - 10. okay pretty cool
01:25 - now we need a
01:29 - erasing area so let's go to the backdrop
01:33 - and draw it i click
01:37 - on the paint
01:42 - and then what i'm gonna do is
01:45 - choose a green color so that
01:48 - looks like it's grass and then paint the
01:51 - whole thing
01:52 - so apparently we need to
01:57 - yeah draw this okay so this is my
02:00 - background
02:01 - and then we need the road
02:06 - okay now let's take a brush
02:11 - and choose a color suitable for
02:14 - the the road
02:18 - and then also make sure this
02:21 - is wide enough so that the car
02:24 - feeling it
02:28 - i would go a little water
02:32 - maybe 100 and then i'm just gonna
02:36 - quickly draw this
02:42 - i'm gonna add a bit of cosmetic to it
02:46 - okay so this color
02:50 - and let's put some lines here
02:53 - with a very narrow one this time
03:05 - and then we need to start line
03:10 - so let's choose a different color
03:14 - also here red
03:18 - so this is our start line and let's
03:22 - write the code now okay
03:25 - let's start writing the code
03:28 - as usual first thing
03:32 - when green fly clicked
03:36 - so the first thing is that i want my car
03:39 - to go to the start line
03:40 - which is also the finish line because
03:43 - this goes one
03:44 - and several laps and
03:48 - by putting it here i've already
03:51 - set the location of x and y
03:55 - so i would say i only need to
04:01 - drag this go to minus one one two six
04:05 - which is where the card is right now and
04:08 - i also
04:09 - want it to the to point to the right
04:12 - direction
04:14 - so i would say turn
04:17 - or like point where is point direction
04:21 - [Music]
04:24 - point towards
04:30 - so point in direction
04:33 - 90 so like what is right now
04:38 - is 90 okay
04:44 - so this is the starting point and now
04:47 - let's write the movements i want to
04:50 - control it with
04:53 - left and right arrow as well as
04:56 - up and down arrows so so i go to events
04:59 - i want to control it by pressing
05:03 - right
05:06 - left up down arrow so when
05:12 - up arrow clicked
05:22 - if up arrow clicked i want to turn
05:26 - upwards so i would say motion
05:32 - turn 15 degrees
05:36 - i'm gonna test here
05:40 - so i'm pressing up
05:47 - so it's the other way around
05:51 - okay so in that case i should say
05:54 - minus 50 so that it works correctly
05:57 - okay and then if i say
06:01 - i'm going to duplicate this
06:05 - two more times
06:11 - so for a down arrow
06:14 - my car should turn 15 degrees
06:18 - so let me try it i'm clicking here and
06:20 - then i'm playing with my
06:22 - keyboard so i played down it's
06:25 - turning 15 degrees
06:34 - okay and then for up
06:37 - arrow
06:41 - for actually right
06:44 - arrow and left arrow
06:48 - for right arrow i'm gonna move
06:51 - forward so this time i don't need turn
06:56 - the same as this one
06:59 - i'm gonna move or
07:03 - maybe glide let's do move
07:07 - first see how it looks like so right
07:10 - move ten step
07:13 - and then lift move minus
07:16 - 10
07:19 - steps okay so far
07:23 - i can control this car let's press start
07:28 - it goes to the starting point with right
07:31 - it goes here
07:32 - i press up turns down turns downward
07:36 - so so far this is movement
07:40 - okay in the next video we're gonna see
07:43 - how we
07:44 - can count the number of laughs that the
07:47 - car is
07:48 - taking in a certain time
07:52 - and also we're gonna see how we can
07:54 - change the speed of the car
07:56 - so that is moving faster here but it's
07:59 - becoming slower when it's on the grass
08:03 - one more thing we're gonna do is that
08:06 - we're gonna
08:07 - make the car collapse when
08:11 - is outside the road so
08:14 - when it's coming here it should sort of
08:18 - become slower slower and then crash
08:21 - so try to think about the solution of
08:23 - these
08:24 - three things if you know how to do it
08:28 - do it in your scratch and put a link of
08:30 - your project
08:31 - on the comment below if not join me in
08:35 - the next video
08:37 - so that we can do it together see you
08:39 - soon
08:40 - next week bye
