00:00 - hello hello hello how are you doing i
00:02 - hope you are all feeling wonderful in
00:05 - this tutorial we are going to see how we
00:08 - can create a maze game in scratch
00:11 - let's dive in
00:13 - [Music]
00:14 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:17 - learn to code and have fun
00:19 - okay let's create a new project first
00:25 - and guess what's gonna be the name
00:28 - obviously
00:29 - we're gonna name it maze
00:33 - so
00:33 - [Music]
00:40 - mace and guess what we need we need a
00:42 - maze as a backdrop first and since the
00:46 - maze is not among the default scratch
00:50 - backdrops
00:51 - i'm going to
00:54 - a
00:56 - maze generator i search for maze
00:59 - generator
01:01 - and the first thing i see
01:03 - this mazegenerator.net
01:08 - is a good place
01:10 - to grab a maze backdrop so
01:14 - i'm going to change the width and height
01:16 - to 10 by 10
01:20 - so that
01:21 - it's not going to be too narrow
01:24 - and then i click on
01:26 - generate
01:29 - here the default is pdf so make sure to
01:32 - change it to png
01:35 - and then just
01:37 - download it
01:38 - to your computer
01:42 - and when it was
01:44 - ready
01:47 - 10 by 10 days
01:51 - all i need to do is
01:53 - go to the backdrop
01:55 - and upload it
01:57 - here
02:00 - so 10 by 10 maze
02:08 - so now we see this beautiful
02:12 - maze is here which is a bit small but
02:15 - i can
02:17 - click on this backdrop
02:20 - tab
02:21 - and then choose this
02:24 - the whole thing
02:26 - and drag it
02:29 - to make sure it's covering the most of
02:33 - the screen
02:35 - so i zoom
02:37 - here
02:39 - and then i drag
02:45 - now this is a good size
02:49 - okay and then this cat is a little too
02:52 - big for
02:53 - the maze
02:55 - so it should fit within these
02:57 - like corridors
02:59 - kind of
03:00 - so let's make it
03:02 - 10
03:04 - or maybe a bit bigger
03:06 - 20
03:09 - seems like a very good size so
03:14 - i also need a goal or like a destination
03:17 - so i'm gonna choose one more sprite
03:24 - let's take
03:27 - what shall we take
03:30 - let's take this gift
03:35 - okay
03:36 - and then i put the gift up
03:38 - at the destination so
03:41 - the cat starts from here and the goal is
03:44 - to get to here
03:46 - and this one is also too big
03:49 - and now
03:51 - it's a good size it can be a bit bigger
03:56 - okay
03:57 - here we go
03:58 - now let's get the fun started
04:01 - we're going to write the code
04:04 - the code is very easy
04:09 - we need to
04:10 - write a code
04:13 - for
04:14 - the cat to move left and right up and
04:17 - down without touching the rolls
04:21 - and when we get to this point
04:24 - we need to say we won or the game is
04:27 - finished or
04:28 - whatever you like
04:31 - and
04:33 - okay let's see how
04:35 - so like always
04:37 - first thing first when
04:40 - a green flag clicked
04:45 - uh we need to check
04:48 - the
04:49 - keyboard
04:50 - presses
04:52 - so constantly so i go to control and i'm
04:56 - gonna check something forever before
04:59 - that
05:00 - what i'm gonna do is
05:03 - let's make sure the cat starts here so i
05:06 - just put the mouse the cat here
05:09 - and from motion
05:12 - i'm going to drag
05:15 - the cat to
05:17 - so go to x y
05:21 - of
05:22 - wherever it's currently is so you see
05:24 - these two numbers are matching
05:27 - already
05:29 - and i also want to make sure that the
05:31 - cat is visible so it's not hidden under
05:34 - any other thing
05:36 - so as a good practice
05:40 - it's good to write show obviously in
05:43 - this scenario it's not going to be
05:45 - hidden because i only have a backdrop
05:48 - and then this is up there but
05:50 - let's just write it
05:53 - and now
05:55 - let's write the movements
05:58 - so i'm gonna say i'm gonna write a code
06:02 - for when you are moving towards the
06:05 - right
06:06 - which means
06:08 - when we are moving towards the right
06:10 - which i can write it by pressing the
06:13 - right arrow click
06:16 - so if from the sensing
06:18 - i'm gonna say key
06:25 - right arrow
06:27 - clicked
06:32 - if clicked
06:33 - then i want to move the cat to the right
06:37 - so i go to motions
06:39 - and i write
06:44 - change x by
06:46 - let's say
06:49 - ten four five two whatever i would say
06:53 - maybe
06:55 - five
06:57 - and
06:59 - since i wanna make it look like the cat
07:02 - is moving rather than gliding
07:05 - since the cat has two
07:08 - castles like this
07:11 - by changing
07:13 - from one costume to another costume i
07:16 - can make it look like it's moving so i
07:18 - would say
07:24 - next costume
07:29 - so if i press right
07:31 - i can move right
07:34 - and the cat looks like is working but
07:37 - obviously the cat should not be able to
07:40 - pass through these lines
07:43 - because they are supposed to be walls
07:45 - right so
07:46 - let's write a code here again
07:51 - another if condition
07:56 - if
07:58 - i'm going to make this 10 to move a bit
08:00 - faster
08:02 - okay now if
08:04 - from sensing
08:07 - since these walls are black i'm going to
08:10 - use color if touching color
08:14 - i click here
08:16 - and then i use this color picker
08:20 - i put it here so that i can choose the
08:23 - color i want now i see if touching color
08:26 - black
08:28 - what i want to do is
08:31 - revert the movements of the cat so if
08:35 - the cat has moved 10 steps forward
08:39 - and then hitting the wall
08:42 - i wanted to say go back to where you
08:44 - were already so i would say
08:47 - if it went 10 steps forward i wanted to
08:50 - say go 10 steps backwards so it looks
08:54 - like it's not cannot pass through the
08:56 - walls
08:58 - so go here
09:02 - and
09:03 - change x by
09:10 - -10
09:13 - so let's give it a test
09:16 - so here is a wall i can't go
09:20 - but if it was here
09:22 - i could google until i get
09:25 - i touch the wall
09:27 - now
09:28 - the same code so just exactly the same
09:32 - this part
09:34 - with a little change can be repeated for
09:38 - left right up down so
09:44 - let's duplicate it once
09:49 - and then here
09:52 - the only difference is
09:56 - for
09:58 - key left arrow
10:01 - i will change
10:03 - 10
10:04 - and the
10:05 - for canceling gets positive 10. okay
10:08 - let's do the same thing for up and down
10:12 - so it's going to be the same thing
10:15 - but here instead of keywrite key up
10:18 - instead of key left key down and
10:22 - instead of change x
10:24 - we will say change y
10:27 - so
10:28 - let's duplicate this
10:33 - and then let's put it
10:35 - aside for now
10:38 - and let's keep only one
10:41 - because we need to change y as well so
10:44 - i'm instead of this one i need to change
10:46 - y so i'm going to drag the code
10:50 - from motion
10:51 - change
10:53 - y by 10
10:56 - so
11:02 - this one
11:03 - we don't need it
11:05 - change y
11:07 - another change y also instead of this
11:13 - okay
11:14 - and
11:20 - minus 10 so i would say
11:25 - if key
11:27 - up arrow clicked
11:32 - change y
11:33 - by 10 if touching the walls cancel it
11:36 - revert it and go back down again
11:40 - so similar to this one i wanted to i
11:43 - want to have a code for downward
11:45 - movement so i duplicate this
11:49 - and
11:51 - i say
11:54 - if down arrow clicked
11:58 - change y by minus 10 and if you needed
12:01 - to revert it if touching the color black
12:04 - color or walls
12:05 - change
12:07 - y by
12:08 - 10. now all i need to do is put them
12:12 - back inside the forever loop
12:16 - and this one as well
12:26 - and this one
12:34 - go down down
12:38 - okay
12:39 - now let's test and see
12:46 - what we have done so far
12:49 - so start
12:59 - it doesn't go up
13:01 - for what reason
13:04 - if q down if key up
13:14 - because it's not in there forever so i'm
13:16 - just putting it in the correct place
13:18 - again
13:20 - okay
13:23 - so make sure
13:25 - to when you are organizing your code
13:27 - every if
13:29 - is exactly under if under forever so
13:35 - currently
13:37 - mine is not so i'm going to fix it
13:42 - right
13:43 - inside there forever
13:47 - now let's see
13:49 - so the cat can go up
13:51 - left up up up up
13:55 - it moves very nice and smooth
13:59 - and it's working properly yay
14:04 - and now
14:06 - okay now i can get to the gift
14:11 - so it means that i could win but how am
14:14 - i gonna tell my player that i want so
14:18 - let's write a code for that part as well
14:21 - i go to the gift
14:23 - and i write
14:26 - when start clicked
14:32 - so that i'm sure that
14:35 - it's not under the backdrop
14:38 - and my cat can actually touch it
14:45 - then
14:45 - i go back to sprite i could as well do
14:48 - it on the gift but i write it here so
14:50 - that i can show everything at one place
14:54 - all right when
14:56 - start clicked
14:59 - forever
15:04 - if
15:08 - touching the gift
15:10 - so sensing and now
15:14 - touching
15:19 - i will change this to gift if touching
15:22 - gift then i need to somehow announce
15:26 - that i'm game over
15:28 - one simple way is just to go here on the
15:31 - looks and say
15:34 - not hello but like you want
15:39 - yay something like this
15:41 - and
15:42 - maybe i can also play a nice
15:45 - winning sound so i go to sounds
15:49 - and
15:50 - search for
15:52 - win
15:56 - let's upload it and then from the code
16:00 - sounds
16:01 - and play sound when until done
16:05 - now let's test it i'm gonna cheat a
16:08 - little bit so that i can show it faster
16:11 - using my mouse
16:13 - so i go up
16:15 - and then i
16:16 - touch and it says you won't
