00:00 - hello and welcome to another kitty code
00:02 - ninja tutorial
00:03 - this is eddie and this is your place to
00:06 - learn to code and have fun
00:08 - today we are going to create a tutorial
00:10 - on transitioning from
00:11 - fall to winter
00:15 - today is the first day of winter and
00:18 - it's called
00:18 - winter solstice so it's the day that we
00:21 - are transitioning from fall to winter
00:24 - and i'm gonna show you how in scratch
00:26 - you can implement transitioning from
00:28 - fall to winter so
00:30 - this is only one example but this is
00:32 - really useful
00:34 - when you are going to create animation
00:36 - and tell a story
00:37 - and you need to transition from one
00:39 - scene to another scene
00:41 - so when you're going from like for
00:44 - instance
00:45 - from outside your house to inside the
00:48 - house and then you move around the
00:50 - scenes
00:51 - it's very useful in games very useful in
00:53 - storytelling
00:55 - and it's so much fun let's dive in
00:58 - all right we're going to see how we can
01:00 - move from fall through winter
01:05 - by using backdrops
01:08 - um so let's go to the scratch website
01:11 - spanish.mit
01:14 - so create and then for this
01:18 - we need two backdrops for the things
01:21 - that we are transitioning
01:23 - to and from i'm gonna choose
01:26 - one backdrop of fall and one for winter
01:29 - and i'm gonna use
01:30 - the backdrops from from the images that
01:33 - i have already downloaded
01:35 - on my computer so
01:40 - you most probably already know how to
01:42 - download the image from internet so i
01:44 - start from here
01:46 - uh first thing let's give our project a
01:48 - name
01:49 - so i'm going to give my project a name
01:52 - winter
01:54 - solstice and then
01:57 - let's get started so i need two
02:00 - backdrops
02:01 - that i'm gonna upload the backdrop from
02:03 - images that are in my computer
02:06 - one for fall and
02:10 - one for winter
02:14 - and winter so if i go to the backdrops
02:22 - i should see both images
02:26 - here and there is also the default
02:28 - backdrop
02:29 - you can either delete it or you can keep
02:31 - it i would
02:32 - keep it but it's your choice
02:36 - i will keep the cat you can
02:39 - insert any sprite that you like it's
02:42 - totally
02:42 - your choice so what i want is
02:47 - i want this cat to be
02:50 - here in the fall first
02:53 - and then glides here
02:57 - and after it reaches the end of the
03:01 - the corner goes to the winter so
03:04 - let's write the code uh first thing i
03:08 - want to start with the
03:10 - full backdrop so i need to make sure
03:12 - that i'm on the fall backdrop first
03:16 - one point is if i click on the code here
03:20 - there is nothing under the motion
03:22 - because
03:23 - we are not supposed to move the backdrop
03:25 - motion code is only
03:27 - for this price so i need to make sure
03:29 - that i click on the sprite first
03:32 - and then i see the motion is here so
03:35 - let's uh trigger our event
03:39 - by writing the code
03:42 - when start clicked so
03:46 - when start clicked
03:49 - uh what i want is i want the cat to be
03:52 - here
03:52 - so i move the cat here
03:57 - when i move the cat here i see
04:00 - what is the position here so
04:03 - it says minus 189 on the x
04:07 - and minus 1 to 5 on the y
04:10 - so if i go to the motion
04:13 - and then i drag the go to
04:16 - the numbers here are also showing
04:21 - where is here and where i put my cat so
04:24 - whenever i'm dragging it like from here
04:26 - the value that i see
04:28 - on the x and y are the same as what i
04:30 - see
04:31 - here initially i can definitely change
04:33 - it but it's a good
04:34 - trick to set the values to where you
04:38 - want just move your
04:39 - sprite and then this will change and it
04:42 - will also change here so
04:44 - when i start clicked go to this location
04:48 - and now from the looks
04:54 - we need to go to the
04:57 - switch backdrop to
05:04 - um
05:07 - fall because i want to start from fall
05:12 - i also want to
05:17 - move the cat to the end of the scene
05:20 - so i'm kind of trying to tell my story
05:23 - so whenever you are creating your
05:24 - animation
05:25 - you also write your storyboard and try
05:28 - to create your story in the language of
05:30 - code so my next step is
05:33 - gliding the cat
05:37 - so i go to the motions
05:40 - and then i look for a glide
05:48 - i glide one second
05:52 - to so i could do it
05:56 - better by moving the cat here
06:00 - first to see the location
06:04 - so i would say this one this part is 205
06:08 - one minus 115 so because i want the very
06:12 - end
06:13 - i would say maybe 2 10
06:16 - and on the y
06:20 - this one
06:23 - all right let's say after the gliding
06:26 - i want this um cat
06:29 - to say something like
06:33 - goodbye fall
06:37 - i will say drag this block from the
06:41 - looks
06:42 - that says
06:48 - goodbye fall for
06:51 - one second let's try and see what
06:54 - happens
06:54 - now so the cat is gliding and saying
06:57 - goodbye fall
07:00 - let's also make it look like the fall
07:03 - or maybe somebody is answering
07:06 - back there is something very interesting
07:10 - here that if you click here
07:12 - so you have a set of codes here but then
07:15 - there are things that are kind of hidden
07:17 - that you can bring them from here so if
07:20 - you click here
07:23 - you can click on the text to speech
07:28 - and now you see some more stuff here
07:31 - so i say
07:37 - speak
07:43 - goodbye
07:48 - and then at the end i need i will be
07:52 - able to hear um
07:58 - the goodbye is being set back to the cat
08:01 - so let's test it so i click on the start
08:06 - say goodbye you see did you read it says
08:09 - goodbye
08:10 - and then after this i want to transition
08:13 - to the winter now
08:18 - again i sage backdrop so from the looks
08:21 - i switch back to up to winter
08:29 - when i went to the winter i want the cat
08:31 - to be at the
08:33 - beginning the left corner of the scene
08:36 - so
08:37 - that it looks like it's gone from here
08:39 - to the next scene and started again
08:42 - so i moved the cat here so that the
08:45 - glide
08:48 - so that the position here is set to
08:50 - where i want it to be so i drag this
08:53 - simply here and the position is already
08:57 - the value of the values of the position
09:00 - are already
09:00 - written equal to what i want
09:04 - so i go to this point and then
09:07 - let's assume i want to
09:11 - let special first run it
09:15 - so you say goodbye here back and i go
09:19 - here
09:20 - let's assume that i want the cat after
09:22 - this
09:24 - to go to here so i drag it here
09:28 - and then i say go to this
09:31 - location or maybe glide to this location
09:36 - goodbye so if you like to i drag this
09:39 - here
09:40 - and i say
09:44 - um this location is 0 and 17 so i glide
09:48 - to this location
09:52 - and i would say i would say
10:02 - hello winter
10:07 - for one second
10:10 - and then i also want to hear back hello
10:14 - so
10:17 - i can change the voice so that
10:20 - it looks like it sounds like the waves
10:23 - are winter and autumn are different so i
10:25 - change it to a different one
10:30 - so i set
10:33 - voice to giant and i
10:38 - speak
10:44 - hello cat
10:47 - let's test it
10:51 - goodbye
10:54 - hello okay really cool
