00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this
00:02 - scratch tutorial
00:03 - i'm ellie and this is your place to
00:05 - learn to code and have fun
00:07 - today we are creating the hero fighting
00:10 - against the chrono wireless game
00:12 - this is an easy beginner tutorial if
00:14 - you've never written any code at all
00:16 - this tutorial is for you start you go to
00:18 - the scratch website by searching
00:21 - scratch mit
00:25 - and just click on this link
00:30 - from here if you click on the create
00:35 - it takes you to the scratch development
00:37 - environment let's get a quick tour of
00:39 - this
00:39 - location first this part
00:43 - on the top right where the cat is is
00:46 - called the
00:46 - stage that's where your game
00:50 - actions or generally everything you
00:52 - program takes place here
00:54 - for example if you write a code that
00:57 - tells the cat
00:58 - to move or dance that's where you see
01:00 - the cat is moving
01:02 - or dancing so in the reward
01:06 - here is the location that you see your
01:08 - output
01:10 - the part under the stage is where we see
01:14 - the sprites
01:15 - and backdrops in this part you can add
01:18 - many sprites or delete this
01:20 - rice and also add the backdrops
01:25 - sprites are like characters in your
01:27 - games
01:28 - every sprite such as this cat has three
01:31 - things
01:32 - which takes us to these three items code
01:35 - costumes and sound discolorful sections
01:40 - that look like pieces of puzzle are
01:42 - called code
01:44 - using these codes you can tell the
01:46 - computer what to do
01:49 - the one beside it which is
01:52 - custom using a custom
01:56 - you can tell your character how you want
01:59 - it to look like
02:00 - so like this is one shape this is
02:02 - another shape
02:04 - and then from sounds you can add as many
02:06 - sounds as you like like
02:08 - mew
02:08 - [Music]
02:14 - alright so let's get back to writing our
02:18 - code
02:19 - first thing we're going to do today is
02:21 - you're going to remove this cat by
02:23 - clicking on this
02:24 - pin and now we are going to add
02:28 - two new sprites
02:31 - one is a hero and the other one is the
02:34 - chrono virus
02:35 - for the hero i just click here and then
02:38 - i go to the sprite library
02:42 - then i can filter down to people maybe
02:46 - and then i just keep searching and see
02:48 - which one looks like
02:50 - that is like a hero maybe this one
02:52 - looking strong
02:54 - okay let's take this first so this is my
02:57 - hero my hero
02:59 - has several customs
03:02 - that's what we want so this is cool
03:06 - and then i need one more thing i need
03:10 - one other character for my chrono virus
03:14 - this is something that i made up so it
03:16 - doesn't exist in this library
03:18 - so we need to create it the way we can
03:21 - do it in scratch
03:23 - you see this paint i can open the paint
03:27 - and create and draw it by myself
03:31 - so i just take a circle from here
03:36 - i draw a circle
03:40 - and then i draw one more smaller circle
03:46 - i press ctrl c to copy it
03:49 - and then i press ctrl ctrl b multiple
03:52 - times to generate
03:54 - several of it and then i lay them around
04:01 - to make it look like a virus
04:03 - alternatively you can just go to google
04:06 - image
04:06 - and download some image into your
04:09 - computer and draw it
04:10 - but then i just wanted to show you how
04:12 - you can draw as well let's put some eyes
04:15 - maybe
04:22 - a mouth an evil one
04:25 - so looks good to me then i press ctrl
04:28 - a i select everything and then i
04:32 - group them together cool
04:36 - so now i have a corona virus and a hero
04:41 - i go here and duplicate this
04:45 - and then i reshape it so that i have two
04:47 - variation of it like two customs
04:50 - so i press ctrl a and then i squish it a
04:54 - bit
04:54 - so that when i'm writing my game i have
04:58 - two different versions like
05:02 - of the coronavirus with two customs okay
05:05 - cool
05:09 - the goal of this mini game is we want
05:11 - this virus to move around
05:14 - and then we want this hero to follow the
05:17 - virus
05:18 - in order to do that we need to write a
05:20 - code for it
05:22 - because computers do not know what to do
05:25 - unless we tell them what to do the same
05:28 - thing for this virus
05:29 - this virus is pretty stupid it doesn't
05:32 - know what to do
05:32 - until we tell them so let's write a code
05:36 - for it the first step in my code is i
05:39 - want to say
05:40 - when this flag is clicked
05:44 - i want something to happen so i go to
05:46 - the code
05:47 - section and then we have various groups
05:50 - of codes
05:52 - i'm talking about an event like when
05:55 - flag
05:55 - clicked so let's look at the events
05:58 - section
05:59 - i have this block so i drag it here when
06:02 - flag is clicked
06:06 - next step is i want the wires to point
06:09 - towards my
06:11 - mouse pointer this is the kind of
06:13 - emotion so let's go to the motion
06:17 - and see what we've got here we have
06:21 - point towards mouse pointer so i drag it
06:24 - here
06:25 - so my expectation is when i click here
06:28 - earth should
06:29 - point towards my mouse pointer with it
06:32 - which it did
06:39 - what happens right now is that this
06:42 - virus points toward my mouse pointer
06:45 - kind of turns around it but it doesn't
06:48 - move towards it i want it to also move
06:50 - towards my mouse pointer so
06:52 - i add one more line of code here i go to
06:55 - the motion category because i'm
06:57 - talking about movement so i drag this
07:00 - move 10 steps
07:02 - and now it moves what this 10
07:05 - step says that is whenever you read this
07:08 - line of code
07:09 - come for move 10 steps so i can adjust
07:12 - this
07:14 - the speed by changing this number to
07:17 - make it faster
07:19 - or make it slower
07:28 - but you see we have a little problem
07:30 - here
07:32 - when the wires get so close to my mouse
07:34 - pointer it makes this
07:35 - a little crazy dance
07:39 - let's try to fix this as well in order
07:41 - to fix
07:42 - this we can
07:45 - say maybe we just don't let the virus to
07:48 - get close to the pointer so we say
07:51 - only move point towards the mouse
07:53 - pointer and move 10 steps only in the
07:55 - condition that the distance between the
07:57 - mouse
07:58 - pointer and the virus is more than a
08:01 - certain amount so
08:03 - let's go to the if conditions from the
08:06 - controls and drag this if then
08:11 - around the forever so
08:16 - this should go out
08:20 - forever do do the things only if
08:23 - some condition is available
08:28 - and then i define the condition by using
08:31 - the greater
08:32 - block operator and the distance from the
08:35 - sensing group
08:36 - so i go to the operator and then i
08:40 - take greater than i put it in here
08:45 - and then from the sensing
08:48 - i take this distance to mass pointer
08:51 - so i'm saying if the distance to mouse
08:54 - pointer is more than
08:55 - 50 unit only in this condition
08:59 - you are required to do this steps
09:02 - so see what happens so now you say it's
09:05 - a bit better
09:05 - it doesn't get too close but it can be
09:08 - even more
09:10 - to make it more stable and maybe
09:13 - even more
09:18 - now i like it better so we play with it
09:22 - until we get to our desired number
09:24 - let's program our hero which is this guy
09:29 - in scratch is called batter but we want
09:31 - to rename it to hero
09:33 - so from here i change the sprite name to
09:37 - hero
09:40 - [Music]
09:42 - what we want this hero to do is chase
09:44 - the wires
09:45 - and smash it this is quite similar to
09:48 - what we did for the virus
09:50 - so we say when the start clicked
09:59 - point towards the
10:03 - so let's go to the motions
10:07 - points where this time you want to point
10:10 - point towards the
10:11 - wires not the mouse pointer so i change
10:14 - it to a point
10:16 - towards the chrono virus
10:21 - and move for instance
10:24 - 10 steps and the same as last time
10:28 - we want it to happen forever so
10:30 - constantly do these things
10:32 - i don't want to click start every moment
10:36 - so here and this should go inside
10:44 - let's see how it works
10:48 - here we go now we also want to do one
10:53 - more thing
10:54 - we want the virus to be squashed and
10:57 - make some noise
10:58 - when the hero hits it so let's go back
11:00 - to the virus again
11:06 - for smashing the wires we can use
11:09 - customs because that's where we can
11:11 - control the shape of sprites the
11:14 - precondition for smashing the wires
11:16 - is being hit by the hero so let's read
11:19 - it like this
11:20 - we need an if then block from control
11:26 - so here we go
11:29 - just like right after the moves and
11:32 - everything
11:40 - and then the condition can be dragged
11:43 - from the sensing group
11:44 - here touching hero is what we need
11:48 - so from the sensing
11:52 - touching
11:55 - the hero i put it here
11:59 - so in case the virus is touching the
12:02 - hero we want something to happen
12:04 - which is getting a new custom
12:07 - since custom is relevant to the looks i
12:10 - go here
12:12 - and then i say next costume vote next
12:15 - costume
12:16 - and then maybe wait a bit
12:22 - stay in that shape for
12:27 - a short time maybe
12:33 - 0.2 seconds and then again
12:38 - next costume
12:43 - let's see how it works
12:48 - yeah so it's being smashed when the
12:51 - battery is hitting it but it's just
12:53 - pretty quick maybe i can make it a
12:55 - little bit
12:57 - slower so that we can see what is
12:59 - actually happening
13:02 - weight maybe 0.6
13:08 - here and here
13:12 - yeah that's what i want super cool right
13:21 - looking at the way this hero is moving
13:24 - it looks like it's just gliding
13:26 - it doesn't really look like it's moving
13:28 - what we want is
13:30 - we wanted to move that stick so that it
13:32 - can smash the wires
13:34 - we also can do this by using a costume
13:37 - like last time
13:38 - so dragging the
13:42 - next costume from the looks
13:46 - here
13:50 - now it looks like it's actually moving
13:54 - that stick in order to make it a little
13:57 - slower
13:59 - i can add a weight here
14:06 - so that i can see the movements easier
14:09 - maybe not not so long
14:18 - like this
14:24 - there are more things we can do to make
14:26 - this more interesting
14:28 - let's say we want a hero to say go away
14:32 - and also make a kind of like a pop
14:36 - noise when it touches the virus so let's
14:39 - create a second module of code
14:41 - so that this one doesn't get super long
14:45 - alright i say when
14:49 - the flag is clicked
14:52 - forever
14:56 - if so i want to condition if
15:02 - the distance to chronovirus
15:07 - um in the
15:14 - here i drag this
15:18 - and then under sensing i choose what i'm
15:21 - measuring the distance again
15:23 - against it so i want to say if the
15:25 - distance to chrono virus
15:28 - is less than
15:32 - 20 and that's in that case
15:36 - i wanted to make some noise or play some
15:39 - sound
15:41 - play sound pop
15:45 - until done so let's see what happens
15:56 - it's just pretty too a bit too much
15:59 - when it's so close so i put a weight
16:03 - after it
16:04 - so that it plays and it also waits
16:10 - where it is here under control and then
16:12 - i added weight
16:19 - i also want to add a kind of a note on
16:22 - top of the
16:23 - hero to say go away so i go to the looks
16:28 - we have this like say
16:36 - i can put it here
16:39 - i change it to say go away
16:44 - for two seconds for instance let's test
16:48 - it
16:50 - way is coming a bit late that's because
16:54 - it should
16:55 - it doesn't need to wait here
17:00 - now it's better it's pretty cool
17:03 - isn't it
17:08 - oops let's fix this type also
17:13 - go away we can also add a backdrop
17:18 - i can add it from here
17:23 - i have all things so i can choose
17:26 - whatever i want
17:28 - we have hero we have virus which one
17:30 - seems more
17:32 - relevant um
17:36 - maybe a just blue sky
17:48 - oh such a cool game we made together
17:52 - i'm so proud of you this was a nice
17:55 - beginner tutorial that showed you some
17:58 - fundamentals of coding such as
18:00 - loops conditions controls
18:02 - troubleshooting
18:03 - and doing more of this stuff can
18:05 - definitely improve your analytical
18:08 - skills and with
18:09 - practice you can write even more awesome
18:12 - and complex games comment below what
18:15 - else you think we can do
18:16 - to make it more fun do you see any issue
18:19 - or bugs here
18:20 - also if you like this video press that
18:23 - little bell icon and subscribe
18:25 - so that you can see my new videos well
18:28 - done everyone and hope to see you
18:30 - soon for another scratch tutorial bye
