00:00 - I know this is a insanely bold claim but
00:05 - let me show you why so you want to use
00:08 - Chad GPT and I use Chad GPT for
00:11 - everything so why would I say something
00:15 - as insane as stop using Chad GPT let me
00:19 - share with you I had a problem which was
00:22 - I love using Chad GPT I love using CLA I
00:25 - love using these AI tools but whenever I
00:27 - had to put in a lot of things visually
00:31 - to speak to I'll give you a simple
00:32 - example if I watched a YouTube tutorial
00:34 - and I wanted to speak to that very very
00:36 - quickly I would not be able to do that
00:39 - with just let's say chat GPT it takes a
00:43 - lot of steps or I would need a Chrome
00:45 - extension and I would need to do 10
00:46 - million things so that got really
00:48 - annoying
00:49 - so I just decided to go with my team and
00:52 - build out our own tool so for example we
00:55 - can do things like this let's say that I
00:57 - want to learn nextjs so let's go nextjs
01:00 - server
01:02 - side uh server actions okay so that's
01:04 - something cool about next year so let's
01:06 - say I go to this and I can find this
01:11 - video so let's say fireship has made a
01:12 - video I'm sure this is going to be a
01:14 - great video so I'm just going to take
01:16 - this fireships video right here um and
01:19 - what I will do is simply just grab the
01:21 - this URL that's it and I'm just going to
01:23 - go here and paste it as soon as I paste
01:25 - it I get that YouTube video right there
01:28 - okay now I'm going to go here and make a
01:31 - new chat this is just like a regular
01:33 - chat GPT chat and I'm just going to
01:35 - connect this video that I got to this so
01:37 - now the chat has access to fires ship's
01:39 - video okay I can play this video here
01:41 - too if I wanted to just yesterday next
01:43 - key value data okay now I'm going to say
01:46 - what are what does he talk about in this
01:52 - video and let's see what it comes up
01:54 - with it discusses new nextjs server
01:57 - action feature okay give me
02:03 - examples so these are the five key
02:06 - things that he talks about in the video
02:08 - and let's just make sure that he
02:09 - actually talks about
02:11 - this form on the form itself we don't
02:14 - use the client's cool so is there okay
02:19 - side on submit event handler we instead
02:21 - pass it in action this is and then
02:23 - submit the form you'll notice that it we
02:25 - don't need to Def in the UI what that
02:27 - means in this case is that it perfect
02:30 - we'll execute the server so now I can
02:32 - say
02:33 - hey give me some example
02:36 - code referenced in the
02:42 - video and boom just like that I even am
02:45 - getting access to the code that he talks
02:47 - about in the
02:51 - video here's a video of my boy sunny
02:54 - right here let's go to this yo what's
02:55 - going on and he's talking about server
02:58 - side stuff learn SSR for next 10 minutes
03:01 - cool I grab this I pop that in and now I
03:05 - can make a new chat if I wanted to or I
03:07 - can even connect it to the same exact
03:08 - chat so let's say I connected here let's
03:11 - say what is he talking
03:14 - about regarding SSR give me key
03:21 - takeaways so let's do this beautiful
03:24 - okay fantastic and now I can combine
03:28 - both of these so now this chat has
03:30 - access to both of these pieces of
03:32 - information so I videos so I can now
03:34 - just go and go hey based on both of
03:37 - these videos give me an
03:42 - example that uses SSR and
03:47 - server
03:50 - actions and so now it's actually
03:52 - starting to combine both of those things
03:56 - okay so it's starting to combine the SSR
04:00 - that slny talks about in this video
04:02 - right here right and then it's starting
04:05 - to combine what fireship talks about in
04:08 - his
04:09 - video and gives you access to that
04:11 - information and now based on this you
04:13 - can code your you know in your own
04:16 - projects so let's say I actually go to
04:18 - my own um Visual Studio code so let's
04:21 - say I go here and I
04:25 - grab let's say one of my files so let's
04:29 - go to one of my components I'll go
04:32 - board. JS and I'll grab this and I'll
04:36 - bring it in here and I'll open up a text
04:40 - node and inside of that text node I'll
04:41 - just paste all this code
04:44 - okay and now I'll connect my code here
04:48 - as well and I'll just
04:50 - say um I just want to make sure that if
04:53 - it sees my code so I'm just going to
04:57 - say give me to two lines of code from my
05:02 - board.jpg
05:30 - update my Bor code so it
05:36 - uses server actions and SSR b um I've
05:40 - already said based on those
05:43 - videos so now it's going to update my
05:46 - code so it's handling server side um so
05:51 - it's doing server side rendering like
05:54 - based on Sunny's video and then it will
05:56 - add also wherever it can ser actions
06:00 - based on Fires ship's video and it's
06:02 - updating my code so things like this
06:07 - traditionally speaking I've not been
06:09 - able to do with just strictly chat GPT
06:13 - I've wanted I've always wanted the tool
06:15 - where I could visually do these things
06:18 - and this platform allows you to do it
06:20 - the easiest way possible now full
06:23 - disclaimer I am a co-founder of this
06:26 - platform it's called poppy Ai and this
06:28 - has been buffed far the best tool that
06:30 - combines because what I always wanted
06:32 - right I always loved using Whimsical or
06:35 - Myro because it has a visual whiteboard
06:38 - kind of thing going on where you could
06:40 - visually do all this stuff and it's so
06:42 - fun and I love
06:44 - that and now that I can combine it with
06:48 - chat GPT I could actually visually talk
06:51 - to chat GPT on a whiteboard so
06:55 - how freaking cool is that so I just
06:57 - thought that that's something cool I
06:58 - wanted to share with you and give you
07:00 - that tool so that you can go and kick
07:02 - other people's ass and um it is a paid
07:05 - tool it's definitely paid because Nas
07:08 - and I are co-founding it so it's
07:10 - basically just the two of us with one
07:11 - developer so we need to basically fund
07:14 - it somehow and we don't have uh you know
07:17 - YC combinator or anything backing us so
07:20 - that's why we have a price point for it
07:22 - for people to use eventually maybe we
07:25 - might have like a completely free trial
07:27 - give it a go I'd love for you to try out
07:29 - this tool and I hope it blows your mind
07:32 - I love your face and I'll talk to you
07:34 - soon peace
