00:00 - let's try to talk about 12 programming
00:02 - languages in minutes let's go now the
00:05 - reason why I'm excited about this video
00:07 - in particular is because I think whether
00:09 - you are beginner or advanced or
00:12 - intermediate it will give you a very
00:14 - high-level view of what has happened
00:15 - with programming languages and sometimes
00:17 - even professional developers don't
00:19 - actually understand the real breadth of
00:21 - the different programming languages that
00:23 - are out there and what you can do with
00:25 - them in this video we're gonna be
00:27 - talking about multiple different
00:28 - programming languages but I do want to
00:29 - emphasize that what programming language
00:32 - you actually choose is important okay
00:36 - don't let people tell you that it's not
00:37 - important because what language you
00:41 - choose defines a lot of what you're
00:42 - gonna do in your career and so on and so
00:44 - forth okay for example if we talked
00:46 - about a programming language like Swift
00:48 - well that's more driven to mobile
00:50 - development we're gonna talk about it
00:52 - later
00:52 - for iOS not the same thing as data
00:54 - analysis or machine learning if you pick
00:57 - something that was to do with like
01:00 - making video games where you're probably
01:01 - gonna choose something like C C sharp
01:03 - okay so what language you pick is
01:06 - actually important now Before we jump
01:09 - right into this video I do want to say
01:11 - that if you ever were interested in
01:13 - becoming a developer or a freelancer and
01:16 - you want to be able to make an income
01:19 - from coding my team and I put together a
01:22 - pretty amazing training it's over one
01:25 - hour long it's absolutely free it's in
01:28 - the description below so definitely go
01:30 - and check that out with that said let's
01:32 - jump right into this video my friend
01:35 - let's go let's look at a low-level
01:37 - programming language versus a high-level
01:39 - programming language kind of let's start
01:41 - right there so take a look on the left
01:45 - hand side where you see a low-level
01:47 - programming language now this looks like
01:49 - a lot of gibberish code it's one zero
01:51 - one zero zero one zero all kinds of
01:54 - random stuff that makes no sense
01:56 - well that's writing coded the Machine
01:58 - level it's almost like you're getting
01:59 - close to the hardware of the actual
02:01 - computer the CPU you're talking to the
02:03 - memory the storage all of it directly
02:06 - and so the code you're gonna write is
02:08 - gonna be really obfuscated really hard
02:10 - to read not really friendly for humans
02:12 - but really good
02:13 - or the computer another thing I want you
02:16 - to notice is look at the processing time
02:18 - it's really really really fast because
02:19 - the computer doesn't have to understand
02:22 - you in any way it doesn't have to
02:23 - compile it anyway it just understands
02:25 - you directly and so the code runs really
02:28 - fast that's the power of low-level
02:31 - programming languages okay so for
02:33 - example machine code is the lowest level
02:36 - programming language that you can do
02:39 - assembly then takes it a step further
02:41 - and then as you keep going you keep
02:44 - getting into higher level programming
02:45 - languages okay so that's one important
02:48 - thing machine language is kind of like
02:50 - talking to the computer in its own
02:51 - language but if you do a high-level
02:55 - language something different like Python
02:57 - or Ruby or JavaScript well now you're
02:59 - speaking to the computer in a different
03:01 - language so it has to get like an
03:03 - interpreter or a translator to translate
03:04 - what you're saying that's what causes
03:06 - and slowdown so now if you take a look
03:09 - at the right hand side what you'll see
03:11 - is you will see code that's very
03:14 - readable steel prices steel prices get
03:16 - greater than two then have a discount
03:18 - otherwise discounted even less and
03:21 - that's how you write code in a
03:23 - high-level programming language and as
03:25 - you can see it's very very readable as
03:27 - opposed to what you see on the left hand
03:29 - side like what kind of garbage is that
03:32 - now this is why most of the times I'm
03:35 - not coding in machine language right but
03:37 - somebody who is creating things that
03:40 - require it to be really really fast
03:42 - they're working at the machine level so
03:45 - if that's the type of thing that excites
03:47 - your wanna work on sensors or games or
03:50 - optimizing things and just making them
03:52 - as fast as possible you're probably
03:54 - gonna want to go to the lower level
03:55 - programming languages if you kind of
03:58 - like things that I enjoy which is
04:00 - working at a higher level with writing
04:02 - code that's easier to read easier to
04:04 - write makes me more productive as a
04:06 - developer rather than my machine well
04:08 - then you probably want to go to words a
04:10 - high-level programming language here's
04:12 - an example of machine code this is what
04:15 - it actually looks like let's keep on
04:18 - going
04:18 - all right now one important thing I want
04:21 - to actually talk to you about is what
04:23 - are a generation languages okay so you
04:26 - have generation 1 2
04:27 - three four and five there are five
04:30 - generation languages you can have so for
04:32 - example the first generation of
04:34 - languages programming languages so it's
04:37 - called one GL one GL is basically
04:39 - machine learning code and low-level
04:42 - languages okay that I'm highlighting
04:43 - right there on the screen for you now
04:45 - you can have second generation languages
04:48 - or two GL and they are also low-level
04:51 - assembly languages there's sometimes
04:53 - using kernels and hardware drives were
04:55 - more commonly used for video editing and
04:57 - video games okay so these are the two GL
05:00 - programming languages that are like
05:03 - assembly all right then you got the
05:07 - third and the fourth which to me are
05:10 - sometimes pretty similar but the third
05:13 - and the four GL programming languages
05:15 - are high-level programming languages and
05:17 - that's where you're talking to a
05:18 - computer more like you're almost
05:20 - speaking English or you're speaking a
05:22 - certain language and the computer is
05:24 - just somehow understanding you so if I
05:28 - go back and look at this you have the
05:31 - third generation of three GL or
05:32 - high-level languages such as C C++ Java
05:35 - JavaScript and Visual Basic so let's
05:38 - talk about a few of them but C is a
05:41 - programming language that's actually
05:43 - just one step above assembly language
05:46 - okay assembly is one level above machine
05:50 - code so the power of the problem with C
05:53 - is that you're writing code that is
05:56 - sometimes difficult to write if you want
05:59 - to achieve a lot you kind of have to
06:00 - write a lot of code to achieve those
06:02 - goals but the good thing is that it's
06:04 - really really really fast C++ is
06:06 - basically C but with like more batteries
06:09 - included and then when you go to Java
06:11 - now Java turns into a high level
06:13 - programming language where I would argue
06:15 - C is still kind of a low-level
06:17 - programming language okay
06:18 - so Java now has more bells and whistles
06:21 - more things that you can actually do
06:23 - with that programming language and then
06:25 - obviously as you get to JavaScript which
06:27 - is you know the programming language for
06:30 - the web that's primarily the reason it
06:33 - was developed as a scripting language
06:34 - and now it can do a lot of different
06:37 - things it can make messaging apps that
06:39 - are really good networking apps
06:41 - and it can also make mobile apps using
06:42 - the react framework they have and what a
06:46 - boost of JavaScript even more in the
06:48 - last few years is with the rise of their
06:51 - framework called node node allows
06:54 - JavaScript to run server-side and that
06:58 - may in JavaScript even more popular and
07:00 - made it grow even more okay so that's
07:04 - kind of third generation and third and
07:06 - fourth generation I again put them in a
07:08 - similar bucket but you have Perl PHP
07:11 - Python Ruby sequel these are all like
07:14 - four GL programming languages we're
07:16 - gonna talk a little bit more about them
07:17 - as we continue in the video and then the
07:19 - fifth generation programming languages
07:21 - are actually artificially intelligent
07:23 - programming languages so in those
07:25 - programming languages a developer is
07:27 - actually not coding most of the times
07:29 - you actually give it constraints and
07:31 - problems and then you let it do the
07:33 - thing and solve the thing and sometimes
07:35 - it even is visual so it allows you to
07:38 - visually do things and then it does the
07:41 - problem-solving for you so it's actually
07:42 - really fascinating so that's how you
07:47 - have like three GL for GL 1 GL 2 GL and
07:50 - you can use that framework to kind of go
07:52 - okay this is high level programming
07:53 - language is a low level programming
07:54 - language okay now with that established
07:56 - let's go to the next thing of the
07:58 - differences between high level languages
08:00 - versus low level languages okay what are
08:02 - the benefits what are the not so much
08:05 - benefits okay so as you can see the high
08:08 - level languages are easier to read hi
08:11 - leg level languages are actually less
08:13 - memory efficient than low level
08:15 - languages which are more memory
08:17 - efficient and it makes sense because the
08:19 - computer doesn't have to do that much
08:20 - translation you're speaking to the
08:21 - computer in its own native language
08:24 - Python is not a native language of the
08:28 - computer it needs to use an interpreter
08:29 - to read python that's why python is
08:32 - really slow if you have java or
08:35 - something else it's using JVM if it's
08:39 - compiling the code for it to read it
08:41 - okay so you have compiler languages you
08:43 - have interpreter languages and so those
08:46 - are always almost always slower even
08:48 - though Java is going to be a little bit
08:50 - more
08:51 - then Python Python is gonna be a lot
08:53 - slower unless you use something like PI
08:55 - Pi which is a JIT compiler just-in-time
08:57 - compiler or you use C Python which is a
09:01 - C implementation of Python and it allows
09:03 - your Python to speed up really fast
09:05 - high-level languages are easy to
09:06 - understand whereas low-level languages
09:08 - or a lot tougher to understand by
09:10 - default the high-level languages are
09:13 - simpler to debug versus low-level
09:16 - languages and this is the important one
09:20 - that I'm just gonna kind of skip to it
09:22 - needs compiler interpreter for
09:24 - translation that's the high level
09:25 - programming languages and then low level
09:28 - programming languages they need an
09:29 - assembler for the translation so for
09:34 - example if we go back to talking about c
09:36 - c++ right people go as c c++ a low-level
09:39 - language what's the what's going on here
09:41 - right c and c++ programming language was
09:43 - considered a lower or middle level
09:46 - languages there's no such thing as
09:47 - middle level it's a very rare use term
09:51 - but it's cut they're kind of a low of a
09:53 - language and they provide minimal amount
09:55 - of abstraction at the smallest cost to
09:57 - performance and efficiency so that means
09:59 - it adds a little bit of abstraction you
10:01 - can still write human looking code but
10:03 - it's so minimal that it still it still
10:08 - allows you to have a very very fast
10:11 - speed it doesn't sacrifice too much
10:13 - speed and it's kind of friendly for
10:15 - humans to write okay it's still more
10:18 - difficult than a lot of the other
10:19 - programming languages so that's kind of
10:21 - the thing with C and then C sharp you
10:23 - know is why is it this is widely used to
10:26 - create video games and unity engine
10:28 - which actually makes up and if you look
10:30 - at it it's the most popular game engine
10:32 - today more than a third of top games are
10:34 - actually made with unity and there are
10:36 - approximately 770 million active users
10:39 - of games created using the Unity engine
10:42 - again why are we using c-sharp for game
10:46 - development and not another programming
10:48 - language like Python or Java well
10:51 - because C and the C family of languages
10:54 - is just going to be much faster and it's
10:57 - gonna smoke every other language and so
10:58 - that's why unity is built with c-sharp
11:02 - and that's why it's just so fast and one
11:05 - of the best
11:05 - so we've talked about lots of different
11:07 - languages we're kind of jumping around
11:09 - into different places I touch base on
11:12 - JavaScript now I want to talk a little
11:15 - bit about Java
11:16 - so Java the main reason why I got really
11:18 - popularized was because of how it could
11:21 - run anywhere that was one of the
11:23 - greatest things that JVM was like one of
11:25 - the most awesome things about Java and
11:27 - now primarily for web development people
11:30 - use the spring framework for Java which
11:32 - allows you to kind of do the full stack
11:34 - so this is the spring framework here
11:38 - okay and it's closed as a source for a
11:41 - modern Java okay coordinate anything
11:43 - build anything connect everything and
11:46 - this is what allows this is what a lot
11:51 - of what people are using Java for
11:53 - another thing people are using Java for
11:55 - a lot is for Android development now
11:58 - there are lots of different programming
12:01 - languages that are growing in popularity
12:03 - for development for example you have
12:06 - Kotlin which is used for Android
12:09 - development as well so that's a big
12:11 - competitor that's by Google and it's
12:14 - probably going to outgrow Java when it
12:16 - comes to mobile development but it's not
12:19 - gonna be anytime soon maybe and then you
12:20 - also have you know there's a few more
12:23 - programming language it's like xamarin
12:25 - which is cross-platform
12:26 - and then you have flutter which is made
12:29 - by Google and it's also cross-platform
12:32 - so it allows you to make iOS apps and it
12:35 - allows you to make Android apps and so
12:38 - my money personally is on flutter I
12:40 - think it's gonna smoke everything but
12:41 - again it doesn't matter what I say it
12:43 - only matters what actually ends up
12:45 - happening but I really like flutter I
12:47 - did create some basic apps with it too
12:49 - and flutter is really really great for
12:52 - cross mobile development so that's my
12:54 - opinion on Java and flutter and we touch
12:57 - based on Kotlin now another mobile
13:00 - development language that I want to talk
13:02 - to you about is Swift Swift is primarily
13:07 - used for iOS mobile development and I
13:10 - think it started somewhere like 2014 ish
13:13 - and Swift started gaining in ranks
13:16 - pretty pretty quickly obviously because
13:19 - was pushing it to make making their main
13:21 - iOS language and the reason behind Swift
13:25 - was so that it's very easily readable
13:27 - it's really really fast and it's a
13:30 - pretty great programming language and
13:32 - they wanted to get rid of Objective C
13:34 - because that's what they were using an
13:36 - objective-c just really clunky and hard
13:37 - to use and it was a pain in the butt so
13:40 - they took away a lot of the objective-c
13:42 - and then replace it with Swift and Swift
13:44 - was their language but you know honestly
13:47 - flutter is pretty damn awesome so I
13:49 - would be looking out for flutter and if
13:51 - you're a developer you should probably
13:53 - look start looking at a little tiny bit
13:56 - into flutter you're not gonna go wrong
13:58 - with it
13:58 - Google is pushing it so you're gonna be
14:00 - pretty happy okay next let's talk about
14:03 - Ruby Ruby is a pretty awesome
14:05 - programming language it's mobile
14:07 - development primarily that's what mostly
14:11 - what people use it for and it's really
14:13 - easy to read the only kind of drawback
14:15 - with Ruby that's happening is if if I go
14:18 - here write to Google Trends and Google
14:21 - Trends is really good to look at and you
14:22 - just select programming language and
14:24 - this is a leading indicator and it tells
14:26 - you the popularity or or whatever of a
14:29 - programming language okay we're just
14:30 - gonna cross out this and we're gonna
14:33 - take a look at Ruby just by itself so
14:36 - ruby is really taking a hit in the last
14:40 - few years when it comes to popularity
14:43 - and so it's not dead and I wouldn't I'm
14:46 - scared to call any language dead but it
14:48 - definitely is on a downward trend so if
14:51 - you're gonna do something with web
14:52 - development maybe go with JavaScript
14:55 - okay you're gonna be better off there
14:56 - it's very popular and it's not going
14:59 - down anytime soon and the trend is much
15:01 - much much bigger right so we're gonna do
15:03 - something with purely web development
15:06 - then Java is gonna eat Ruby any day for
15:10 - breakfast
15:11 - that's my verdict that's my that's what
15:14 - I wanted to share with you on Ruby now
15:16 - I'm gonna talk to you about obviously my
15:19 - favorite programming language if you are
15:20 - a follower on my channel you know I just
15:22 - talk about it all the time and I will
15:24 - continue to talk about it all the time
15:25 - because it's awesome I'm like the Gary
15:27 - Vee for Python alright so let's talk
15:30 - about Python and if I put up Python
15:32 - you're gonna see the Python it's gonna
15:34 - eat actually all of them up so if we go
15:37 - from 2004 to present oh I'm sorry I was
15:40 - blocking the view there so if you look
15:42 - now you'll see that Python is the yellow
15:45 - one and it comes and it just eats
15:47 - everything okay and if you don't believe
15:51 - this then what you should do is you
15:53 - should open up like YouTube and then
15:55 - also type in Python here and see what
15:57 - comes up okay and you'll see the top
16:00 - videos have like eight point three
16:01 - million views as you can see right here
16:03 - I'll try to zoom in so it's a little bit
16:06 - easier for you to see you'll see eight
16:08 - point three million views and if I
16:10 - actually type in JavaScript you will not
16:13 - see anywhere near those views right at
16:15 - the top 1.8 million views that's a big
16:17 - difference this is one of the leading
16:19 - indicators this is actually called Pipal
16:21 - popularity of a programming language and
16:23 - it's one of the best way to determine
16:26 - how popular or programming languages and
16:29 - its demand you don't want to look at
16:31 - something like Toby index because it's a
16:33 - lagging indicator it only tells you how
16:35 - many webpages there are for a certain
16:37 - language okay because objective-c has
16:39 - like 2030 million webpages but who the
16:42 - hell is reading those webpages okay and
16:44 - so Toby is more of a lagging indicator
16:46 - you want to look at Pipal it's a leading
16:48 - indicator or just go to Google Trends
16:50 - and look for yourself so that's one of
16:52 - the reasons why I'm a fan of it and for
16:56 - for Python you have this framework you
16:58 - have multiple different a web
16:59 - development frameworks one of the
17:01 - frameworks that I really like and that's
17:03 - one of my favorites is Django and the
17:06 - thing that I like about it is that it's
17:08 - made for me it's a web framework for
17:12 - perfectionist with deadlines alright so
17:14 - if I just zoom into that and if you can
17:16 - read it at the top here that's my
17:18 - favorite line the web framework for
17:20 - perfectionist with deadlines so with
17:22 - Python you have a lot of functionality I
17:24 - mean obviously it most languages have
17:26 - lots of functionality I'm just biased
17:27 - towards Python but you can do web
17:30 - development with Python you can do also
17:31 - lots of data analysis and machine
17:34 - learning type of stuff that's why that's
17:36 - one of the reasons why it's growing so
17:38 - much in popularity because that's one of
17:41 - the things that people are really
17:42 - looking to learn but I just like the
17:44 - fact that it's flexible enough to do
17:46 - things and do most things really well
17:49 - and make you really productive as a
17:50 - developer it's also very very easy to
17:53 - read it and there are lots of job
17:55 - opportunities out there for these for
17:57 - this programming language so there you
17:59 - have it I've covered lots of different
18:01 - programming languages I don't know how
18:04 - many minutes this is do you have any
18:06 - idea Frankie no okay so hopefully that
18:10 - was covered in less than 20 minutes and
18:13 - I hope you did enjoy or get something
18:16 - out of it now I want to leave you with
18:17 - this every programming language has its
18:19 - pros and cons but really look at why you
18:23 - are learning a programming language look
18:25 - at what the future looks like look like
18:27 - look at what the job salaries for that
18:30 - programming language look like really
18:33 - pay attention to that because if you
18:34 - don't pay attention to that it's gonna
18:36 - determine your future and a big chunk of
18:38 - your life okay because if you're doing
18:41 - mobile development sure you can switch
18:43 - out but you'd be much better off if you
18:46 - became a specialist with that and the
18:48 - language is gonna determine a lot of
18:51 - your behavior okay it's kind of like
18:53 - culture if you grow up in a
18:56 - predominantly Caucasian culture you're
18:59 - gonna have the impact of that if you
19:01 - grow up in America versus if you grow up
19:03 - in China or you grow up in Hawaii or you
19:06 - grow up in India or Pakistan your
19:09 - childhood and the environment around is
19:11 - gonna shape what you do who you become
19:13 - okay if you're african-american and
19:15 - you're growing up in America the things
19:17 - you're gonna deal with maybe somebody
19:19 - else is not dealing with those same
19:20 - things okay so that culture in what you
19:23 - stick with is gonna determine a lot of
19:25 - your job opportunities what you go on to
19:26 - do so a programming language is very
19:28 - similar if you pick up JavaScript the
19:30 - community that you're gonna be a part of
19:31 - the things that you're gonna create it's
19:33 - automatically gonna be really a lot of
19:35 - it is gonna be client facing stuff and
19:37 - you're gonna be making a lot of
19:38 - front-end stuff it's just part of it
19:40 - okay if you do primarily Python you're
19:43 - gonna be doing more backend stuff you're
19:44 - gonna be doing maybe more full-stack
19:46 - stuff or you're gonna be doing more data
19:48 - analysis stuff it's kind of the part of
19:50 - it and the culture of it so something
19:52 - really important to understand then
19:54 - other important things to understand is
19:55 - what are the opportunities that demand
19:57 - how is it growing and what are how much
19:59 - can you be earning as a developer okay
20:02 - so some programming languages if you
20:03 - learn them you come a specialist in them
20:05 - maybe you make fifty or sixty thousand
20:07 - dollars a year but the nice thing about
20:08 - certain languages like JavaScript in
20:10 - Python you can be making over six
20:12 - figures as a developer if you're a great
20:14 - developer if you get a job in United
20:16 - States of America then that's the case
20:18 - otherwise for average developer
20:20 - worldwide as a developer you'll be
20:23 - making between fifty fifty to sixty
20:24 - thousand dollars a year depending on
20:26 - your skill set depending on your
20:28 - negotiation skills and all of those
20:31 - things combined now I hope this video
20:33 - gave you a lot of perspective I do want
20:36 - to just say my team and I have put
20:37 - together an amazing free training for
20:40 - you it's to help you become a freelancer
20:43 - with Python so we share our secrets with
20:46 - you on how you can actually become a
20:48 - freelancer that can make more than six
20:49 - figures and have a pretty amazing career

Cleaned transcript:

let's try to talk about 12 programming languages in minutes let's go now the reason why I'm excited about this video in particular is because I think whether you are beginner or advanced or intermediate it will give you a very highlevel view of what has happened with programming languages and sometimes even professional developers don't actually understand the real breadth of the different programming languages that are out there and what you can do with them in this video we're gonna be talking about multiple different programming languages but I do want to emphasize that what programming language you actually choose is important okay don't let people tell you that it's not important because what language you choose defines a lot of what you're gonna do in your career and so on and so forth okay for example if we talked about a programming language like Swift well that's more driven to mobile development we're gonna talk about it later for iOS not the same thing as data analysis or machine learning if you pick something that was to do with like making video games where you're probably gonna choose something like C C sharp okay so what language you pick is actually important now Before we jump right into this video I do want to say that if you ever were interested in becoming a developer or a freelancer and you want to be able to make an income from coding my team and I put together a pretty amazing training it's over one hour long it's absolutely free it's in the description below so definitely go and check that out with that said let's jump right into this video my friend let's go let's look at a lowlevel programming language versus a highlevel programming language kind of let's start right there so take a look on the left hand side where you see a lowlevel programming language now this looks like a lot of gibberish code it's one zero one zero zero one zero all kinds of random stuff that makes no sense well that's writing coded the Machine level it's almost like you're getting close to the hardware of the actual computer the CPU you're talking to the memory the storage all of it directly and so the code you're gonna write is gonna be really obfuscated really hard to read not really friendly for humans but really good or the computer another thing I want you to notice is look at the processing time it's really really really fast because the computer doesn't have to understand you in any way it doesn't have to compile it anyway it just understands you directly and so the code runs really fast that's the power of lowlevel programming languages okay so for example machine code is the lowest level programming language that you can do assembly then takes it a step further and then as you keep going you keep getting into higher level programming languages okay so that's one important thing machine language is kind of like talking to the computer in its own language but if you do a highlevel language something different like Python or Ruby or JavaScript well now you're speaking to the computer in a different language so it has to get like an interpreter or a translator to translate what you're saying that's what causes and slowdown so now if you take a look at the right hand side what you'll see is you will see code that's very readable steel prices steel prices get greater than two then have a discount otherwise discounted even less and that's how you write code in a highlevel programming language and as you can see it's very very readable as opposed to what you see on the left hand side like what kind of garbage is that now this is why most of the times I'm not coding in machine language right but somebody who is creating things that require it to be really really fast they're working at the machine level so if that's the type of thing that excites your wanna work on sensors or games or optimizing things and just making them as fast as possible you're probably gonna want to go to the lower level programming languages if you kind of like things that I enjoy which is working at a higher level with writing code that's easier to read easier to write makes me more productive as a developer rather than my machine well then you probably want to go to words a highlevel programming language here's an example of machine code this is what it actually looks like let's keep on going all right now one important thing I want to actually talk to you about is what are a generation languages okay so you have generation 1 2 three four and five there are five generation languages you can have so for example the first generation of languages programming languages so it's called one GL one GL is basically machine learning code and lowlevel languages okay that I'm highlighting right there on the screen for you now you can have second generation languages or two GL and they are also lowlevel assembly languages there's sometimes using kernels and hardware drives were more commonly used for video editing and video games okay so these are the two GL programming languages that are like assembly all right then you got the third and the fourth which to me are sometimes pretty similar but the third and the four GL programming languages are highlevel programming languages and that's where you're talking to a computer more like you're almost speaking English or you're speaking a certain language and the computer is just somehow understanding you so if I go back and look at this you have the third generation of three GL or highlevel languages such as C C++ Java JavaScript and Visual Basic so let's talk about a few of them but C is a programming language that's actually just one step above assembly language okay assembly is one level above machine code so the power of the problem with C is that you're writing code that is sometimes difficult to write if you want to achieve a lot you kind of have to write a lot of code to achieve those goals but the good thing is that it's really really really fast C++ is basically C but with like more batteries included and then when you go to Java now Java turns into a high level programming language where I would argue C is still kind of a lowlevel programming language okay so Java now has more bells and whistles more things that you can actually do with that programming language and then obviously as you get to JavaScript which is you know the programming language for the web that's primarily the reason it was developed as a scripting language and now it can do a lot of different things it can make messaging apps that are really good networking apps and it can also make mobile apps using the react framework they have and what a boost of JavaScript even more in the last few years is with the rise of their framework called node node allows JavaScript to run serverside and that may in JavaScript even more popular and made it grow even more okay so that's kind of third generation and third and fourth generation I again put them in a similar bucket but you have Perl PHP Python Ruby sequel these are all like four GL programming languages we're gonna talk a little bit more about them as we continue in the video and then the fifth generation programming languages are actually artificially intelligent programming languages so in those programming languages a developer is actually not coding most of the times you actually give it constraints and problems and then you let it do the thing and solve the thing and sometimes it even is visual so it allows you to visually do things and then it does the problemsolving for you so it's actually really fascinating so that's how you have like three GL for GL 1 GL 2 GL and you can use that framework to kind of go okay this is high level programming language is a low level programming language okay now with that established let's go to the next thing of the differences between high level languages versus low level languages okay what are the benefits what are the not so much benefits okay so as you can see the high level languages are easier to read hi leg level languages are actually less memory efficient than low level languages which are more memory efficient and it makes sense because the computer doesn't have to do that much translation you're speaking to the computer in its own native language Python is not a native language of the computer it needs to use an interpreter to read python that's why python is really slow if you have java or something else it's using JVM if it's compiling the code for it to read it okay so you have compiler languages you have interpreter languages and so those are always almost always slower even though Java is going to be a little bit more then Python Python is gonna be a lot slower unless you use something like PI Pi which is a JIT compiler justintime compiler or you use C Python which is a C implementation of Python and it allows your Python to speed up really fast highlevel languages are easy to understand whereas lowlevel languages or a lot tougher to understand by default the highlevel languages are simpler to debug versus lowlevel languages and this is the important one that I'm just gonna kind of skip to it needs compiler interpreter for translation that's the high level programming languages and then low level programming languages they need an assembler for the translation so for example if we go back to talking about c c++ right people go as c c++ a lowlevel language what's the what's going on here right c and c++ programming language was considered a lower or middle level languages there's no such thing as middle level it's a very rare use term but it's cut they're kind of a low of a language and they provide minimal amount of abstraction at the smallest cost to performance and efficiency so that means it adds a little bit of abstraction you can still write human looking code but it's so minimal that it still it still allows you to have a very very fast speed it doesn't sacrifice too much speed and it's kind of friendly for humans to write okay it's still more difficult than a lot of the other programming languages so that's kind of the thing with C and then C sharp you know is why is it this is widely used to create video games and unity engine which actually makes up and if you look at it it's the most popular game engine today more than a third of top games are actually made with unity and there are approximately 770 million active users of games created using the Unity engine again why are we using csharp for game development and not another programming language like Python or Java well because C and the C family of languages is just going to be much faster and it's gonna smoke every other language and so that's why unity is built with csharp and that's why it's just so fast and one of the best so we've talked about lots of different languages we're kind of jumping around into different places I touch base on JavaScript now I want to talk a little bit about Java so Java the main reason why I got really popularized was because of how it could run anywhere that was one of the greatest things that JVM was like one of the most awesome things about Java and now primarily for web development people use the spring framework for Java which allows you to kind of do the full stack so this is the spring framework here okay and it's closed as a source for a modern Java okay coordinate anything build anything connect everything and this is what allows this is what a lot of what people are using Java for another thing people are using Java for a lot is for Android development now there are lots of different programming languages that are growing in popularity for development for example you have Kotlin which is used for Android development as well so that's a big competitor that's by Google and it's probably going to outgrow Java when it comes to mobile development but it's not gonna be anytime soon maybe and then you also have you know there's a few more programming language it's like xamarin which is crossplatform and then you have flutter which is made by Google and it's also crossplatform so it allows you to make iOS apps and it allows you to make Android apps and so my money personally is on flutter I think it's gonna smoke everything but again it doesn't matter what I say it only matters what actually ends up happening but I really like flutter I did create some basic apps with it too and flutter is really really great for cross mobile development so that's my opinion on Java and flutter and we touch based on Kotlin now another mobile development language that I want to talk to you about is Swift Swift is primarily used for iOS mobile development and I think it started somewhere like 2014 ish and Swift started gaining in ranks pretty pretty quickly obviously because was pushing it to make making their main iOS language and the reason behind Swift was so that it's very easily readable it's really really fast and it's a pretty great programming language and they wanted to get rid of Objective C because that's what they were using an objectivec just really clunky and hard to use and it was a pain in the butt so they took away a lot of the objectivec and then replace it with Swift and Swift was their language but you know honestly flutter is pretty damn awesome so I would be looking out for flutter and if you're a developer you should probably look start looking at a little tiny bit into flutter you're not gonna go wrong with it Google is pushing it so you're gonna be pretty happy okay next let's talk about Ruby Ruby is a pretty awesome programming language it's mobile development primarily that's what mostly what people use it for and it's really easy to read the only kind of drawback with Ruby that's happening is if if I go here write to Google Trends and Google Trends is really good to look at and you just select programming language and this is a leading indicator and it tells you the popularity or or whatever of a programming language okay we're just gonna cross out this and we're gonna take a look at Ruby just by itself so ruby is really taking a hit in the last few years when it comes to popularity and so it's not dead and I wouldn't I'm scared to call any language dead but it definitely is on a downward trend so if you're gonna do something with web development maybe go with JavaScript okay you're gonna be better off there it's very popular and it's not going down anytime soon and the trend is much much much bigger right so we're gonna do something with purely web development then Java is gonna eat Ruby any day for breakfast that's my verdict that's my that's what I wanted to share with you on Ruby now I'm gonna talk to you about obviously my favorite programming language if you are a follower on my channel you know I just talk about it all the time and I will continue to talk about it all the time because it's awesome I'm like the Gary Vee for Python alright so let's talk about Python and if I put up Python you're gonna see the Python it's gonna eat actually all of them up so if we go from 2004 to present oh I'm sorry I was blocking the view there so if you look now you'll see that Python is the yellow one and it comes and it just eats everything okay and if you don't believe this then what you should do is you should open up like YouTube and then also type in Python here and see what comes up okay and you'll see the top videos have like eight point three million views as you can see right here I'll try to zoom in so it's a little bit easier for you to see you'll see eight point three million views and if I actually type in JavaScript you will not see anywhere near those views right at the top 1.8 million views that's a big difference this is one of the leading indicators this is actually called Pipal popularity of a programming language and it's one of the best way to determine how popular or programming languages and its demand you don't want to look at something like Toby index because it's a lagging indicator it only tells you how many webpages there are for a certain language okay because objectivec has like 2030 million webpages but who the hell is reading those webpages okay and so Toby is more of a lagging indicator you want to look at Pipal it's a leading indicator or just go to Google Trends and look for yourself so that's one of the reasons why I'm a fan of it and for for Python you have this framework you have multiple different a web development frameworks one of the frameworks that I really like and that's one of my favorites is Django and the thing that I like about it is that it's made for me it's a web framework for perfectionist with deadlines alright so if I just zoom into that and if you can read it at the top here that's my favorite line the web framework for perfectionist with deadlines so with Python you have a lot of functionality I mean obviously it most languages have lots of functionality I'm just biased towards Python but you can do web development with Python you can do also lots of data analysis and machine learning type of stuff that's why that's one of the reasons why it's growing so much in popularity because that's one of the things that people are really looking to learn but I just like the fact that it's flexible enough to do things and do most things really well and make you really productive as a developer it's also very very easy to read it and there are lots of job opportunities out there for these for this programming language so there you have it I've covered lots of different programming languages I don't know how many minutes this is do you have any idea Frankie no okay so hopefully that was covered in less than 20 minutes and I hope you did enjoy or get something out of it now I want to leave you with this every programming language has its pros and cons but really look at why you are learning a programming language look at what the future looks like look like look at what the job salaries for that programming language look like really pay attention to that because if you don't pay attention to that it's gonna determine your future and a big chunk of your life okay because if you're doing mobile development sure you can switch out but you'd be much better off if you became a specialist with that and the language is gonna determine a lot of your behavior okay it's kind of like culture if you grow up in a predominantly Caucasian culture you're gonna have the impact of that if you grow up in America versus if you grow up in China or you grow up in Hawaii or you grow up in India or Pakistan your childhood and the environment around is gonna shape what you do who you become okay if you're africanamerican and you're growing up in America the things you're gonna deal with maybe somebody else is not dealing with those same things okay so that culture in what you stick with is gonna determine a lot of your job opportunities what you go on to do so a programming language is very similar if you pick up JavaScript the community that you're gonna be a part of the things that you're gonna create it's automatically gonna be really a lot of it is gonna be client facing stuff and you're gonna be making a lot of frontend stuff it's just part of it okay if you do primarily Python you're gonna be doing more backend stuff you're gonna be doing maybe more fullstack stuff or you're gonna be doing more data analysis stuff it's kind of the part of it and the culture of it so something really important to understand then other important things to understand is what are the opportunities that demand how is it growing and what are how much can you be earning as a developer okay so some programming languages if you learn them you come a specialist in them maybe you make fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year but the nice thing about certain languages like JavaScript in Python you can be making over six figures as a developer if you're a great developer if you get a job in United States of America then that's the case otherwise for average developer worldwide as a developer you'll be making between fifty fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year depending on your skill set depending on your negotiation skills and all of those things combined now I hope this video gave you a lot of perspective I do want to just say my team and I have put together an amazing free training for you it's to help you become a freelancer with Python so we share our secrets with you on how you can actually become a freelancer that can make more than six figures and have a pretty amazing career as a developer beyond a pretty
