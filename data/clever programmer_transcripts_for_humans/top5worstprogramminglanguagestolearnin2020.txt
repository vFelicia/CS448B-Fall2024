00:00 - what's up guys this is Kazi here from
00:02 - clever programmer comm today we're doing
00:04 - something very very fascinating first of
00:06 - all we're gonna be talking about the top
00:07 - 5 worst programming languages in 2020 so
00:12 - that's gonna be really exciting when
00:13 - we're talking about all kinds of crazy
00:15 - programming languages from brain fog to
00:17 - whitespace to wall code to Trump scripts
00:19 - to whatever else and we're doing
00:22 - something really fascinating which is
00:24 - that we are in a podcast studio and we
00:26 - have a team of four people today Before

00:37 - send it to you right away it's
00:39 - absolutely free it's filled with a lot
00:41 - of value and you're gonna learn a lot
00:44 - about programming so you can go from
00:45 - zero to knowing how to become a
00:47 - six-figure developer or a freelancer it
00:49 - lays out the path for you so please put
00:52 - in your email for that it's it's gonna
00:54 - be in the description below as well or
00:55 - you can just go to clever programmer
00:57 - comm and sign up for free with that said
01:00 - let's jump right into this podcast so
01:03 - you guys probably know Aaron we got
01:07 - Frankie in the house yo and we go knows
01:11 - hello hello how's it going everybody
01:17 - dumansky
01:18 - yes nas is a special guest here from
01:21 - Detroit Michigan he's a developer he's a
01:23 - django developer he's a badass
01:25 - freelancer and so we're gonna be
01:28 - learning a lot of things and we
01:29 - shouldn't be kicking back relaxing and
01:30 - having a lot of fun so welcome thank you
01:33 - thank you for having me I appreciate it
01:34 - this is awesome a young cat 2:24 what's
01:38 - up successful freelance for 24 huh well
01:40 - yeah still learning a lot still learning
01:45 - a lot so nas talk to me how you got into
01:52 - freelancing a little bit you know just
01:54 - so people can get a little bit of
01:55 - context like just talk about how you got
01:57 - into freelancing yeah and of what you've
02:00 - accomplished so far with it just a
02:02 - little bit of a recap so people know
02:03 - yeah so something I've been developing
02:05 - for about seven years now right so
02:07 - started back in high school that kind of
02:09 - worked the work that startups work the
02:12 - corporations
02:13 - and for the past for the past like you
02:17 - know two years I've worked at a startup
02:18 - called kind of service calm and yeah and
02:22 - and seven months ago like I decided to
02:25 - quit I decided to quit because I want to
02:27 - try something else and with the chest
02:28 - something different and I wasn't really
02:30 - really excited about where where I was
02:33 - going so and all of a sudden I was like
02:35 - you know what this is something I need
02:37 - to try this is something need to do as I
02:40 - just decided to quit and there we go
02:42 - here we are right now for the past seven
02:45 - months it has been an interesting
02:46 - journey had to learn a lot of things and
02:49 - it was definitely difficult and it still
02:51 - it still really is difficult but but you
02:55 - know it's amazing to have the freedom
02:56 - that you get from something like this
02:59 - and to learn so much because now not
03:01 - only you are as are you a developer but
03:05 - you are kind of a businessperson right
03:07 - your sales guy your your manager right
03:09 - you're thinking about so many different
03:11 - things and itself that that is the
03:15 - interesting part too right yeah you got
03:17 - to do a little bit of everything and
03:19 - especially when you're doing because you
03:21 - said you started working in startups
03:22 - yeah you kind of got to do a little bit
03:24 - of everything in a start-up you're
03:27 - wearing lots of different hats I mean
03:28 - just like ask these guys you know
03:31 - Frankie and Aaron I mean how many hats
03:33 - do you guys have to wear working in a
03:36 - working in a start-up he wears a lot you
03:45 - get to touch a lot of different um a lot
03:48 - of different topics really like I
03:50 - started off as a video editor and stuff
03:51 - now we do a bunch of I don't know philia
03:54 - marketing things and we all kind of get
03:57 - to know what each other is doing so you
03:59 - know you kind of jump into other fields
04:00 - and stuff and it's cool because you kind
04:03 - of get to know what else you're made of
04:05 - you know not just like like what I see
04:07 - in nas is like this guy's like super
04:09 - into development but I also see him just
04:11 - ease when like I see a lot of developers
04:13 - and a lot of times these guys I don't
04:15 - wanna you know generalize but a lot of
04:17 - times developers are a little bit more
04:19 - low-energy asked to say and there have a
04:23 - little bit of trouble expressing
04:23 - themselves and I see Naz talking about
04:25 - something like SEO which is not even
04:27 - like completely related to development
04:28 - or at all but he's just [ __ ] passion
04:31 - kinase where you passionate and stuff
04:33 - and it's it's contagious you know and
04:35 - it's a [ __ ] swear on this podcast
04:37 - okay yeah but those qualities I feel are
04:40 - great for like freelancing and stuff and
04:42 - those qualities are also great for small
04:44 - companies you know yeah I think well
04:46 - communication I think one of the things
04:47 - you mentioned communication being able
04:49 - to communicate properly is one of the
04:51 - biggest qualities in itself and a
04:53 - developer how can anybody else right
04:55 - especially as a developer a
04:57 - communication quality being able to
04:58 - communicate between the developers the
05:01 - business people right right
05:02 - that is a very big quality that a lot is
05:05 - underrated right but with it with it you
05:09 - can go very far so far right like
05:13 - communication is very important the octa
05:15 - MIMO communication well I probably the
05:19 - worst communication yeah I communicate
05:20 - about it I mean it's important you have
05:24 - to be on a team like that this is
05:25 - actually the first real like legit team
05:27 - I've been on besides like you know
05:28 - soccer teams and stupid school projects
05:31 - that don't really count like I never
05:32 - actually had that you got a
05:34 - communicating little blow with everybody
05:35 - but even with like communicating with
05:37 - like other people like you guys how many
05:38 - hats you go where I think we all wear
05:39 - every hat like at some point yeah we're
05:41 - all learning everything yeah some of us
05:43 - are better than others but yeah
05:45 - communication is so important like
05:46 - that's why I got on the team in the
05:48 - first place I found you guys just
05:49 - communication right it's important yeah
05:52 - like when it comes to for example for
05:54 - developers to land a job you can't take
05:56 - me you gotta reach out that's one
05:59 - communication and you gotta be able to
06:00 - actually land the contract and then keep
06:03 - the client that requires communication
06:05 - and most people either they can't get a
06:08 - client lack of communication in that
06:10 - place and then they can't keep a client
06:14 - a lot of the times and most of the time
06:16 - that happens because they've either lost
06:17 - the trust or didn't follow up or
06:20 - whatever the case may be
06:22 - yeah and also this is how deals happen
06:25 - we were watching this crazy ass show of
06:27 - recently men who built America
06:29 - [ __ ] awesome show amazing it's such
06:31 - an amazing show and in
06:33 - they're talking about Vanderbilt and
06:36 - Rockefeller who built you know according
06:38 - to today it would he would be worth what
06:40 - two hundred twenty five billion dollars
06:41 - at the time this guy communicated with
06:44 - Vanderbilt and he wasn't scared and he
06:47 - could withstand the pressure and he was
06:48 - in that moment he made the deal this
06:52 - happens a lot of times with developers
06:53 - way where they're afraid to negotiate
06:56 - for what they want
06:57 - yeah they are afraid to withstand the
07:00 - pressure they could be working for a
07:01 - company for like ten twenty years but
07:03 - they're they're pretty afraid to go up
07:06 - to their boss and be like hey can I make
07:09 - like ten dollars more man per hour it's
07:11 - actually it's great thing you mentioned
07:13 - that right because you know being able
07:15 - to kind of stand up for yourself and to
07:17 - communicate that so you know I've worked
07:19 - with different people and and there's a
07:23 - difference between you can have a
07:24 - developer who was just as good as
07:26 - another developer right but if that one
07:28 - developer is able to go out there and is
07:31 - not afraid to kind of put himself out
07:33 - there and you know go to the CEO and ask
07:35 - for my money for example right he will
07:38 - actually be he will actually be able to
07:40 - go much further and someone who's just
07:42 - kind of scared and it's still at the
07:44 - same level like you know still the same
07:46 - level knowledge wise and experience wise
07:49 - the guy who was able to ask and to
07:51 - demand right will be able to go much
07:53 - further much further yeah okay with that
07:56 - let's get into the languages okay so
08:00 - let's let's start with this so this but
08:02 - this was a lot of good stuff that we're
08:03 - talking about we continue to talk about
08:05 - this type of fascinating stuff but let's
08:07 - give people what they really came for
08:09 - all right so top five worst programming
08:12 - languages number five
08:15 - drum bro which one is it you said we're
08:19 - starting with Lou alright that's pretty
08:21 - good yeah I don't even know what it is
08:23 - alright so I just heard it was bet yeah
08:28 - it's a bad language man it's it's a high
08:30 - level programming language mm-hmm right
08:33 - Lua is a powerful and fast programming
08:36 - language that is easy to learn use and
08:38 - embed in your application all right good
08:40 - marketing yeah design in 1993 as a
08:44 - language for extending software
08:46 - applications to me
08:47 - demand of customization at the time oh
08:49 - they got cuz they had customizations at
08:51 - the time there that's possible dang
08:55 - focus of approving speed and probability
08:58 - and accessibility
09:00 - the only time I've actually heard about
09:02 - Lua is the only experience I have had
09:05 - with it is running a video game server I
09:08 - don't know if people know this game but
09:10 - it's a really popular game in Europe
09:13 - it's called tibia
09:13 - it's a mmm mmm Oh RPG and these guys are
09:17 - it's like a 2d universe or world or
09:19 - whatever and it's funny because I mean
09:21 - just graphically it's not that hard to
09:23 - recreate the game or whatever but the
09:25 - way that you would change like the
09:26 - values of like items like let's say
09:28 - armor is 15 or 14 or whatever and I hope
09:31 - I'm not like geeking out too much but
09:32 - like you can not everybody who's a
09:34 - program yeah exactly so you would go
09:37 - into the Lua files and I would actually
09:39 - change the scripts on just notepad I
09:41 - would open them up on notepad and change
09:43 - the scripts there change the values from
09:45 - like Armour 15 to 17 and then it would
09:48 - change that inside the game you [ __ ]
09:49 - cheater
09:50 - yeah it was my universe it was my server
09:52 - so people would play under my rules so I
09:54 - would choose what type of you know what
09:56 - type of oh that's awesome yeah and and
09:57 - that's how I actually got to know Lua I
09:59 - didn't even know was a language I
10:01 - thought it was a phone extension by the
10:02 - way guys everybody's a developer here
10:04 - yeah but go ahead but yeah that's that's
10:06 - pretty much what I know about it and I
10:09 - honestly I knew nothing about code I
10:11 - didn't even know it was coding but it's
10:13 - actually pretty easy for beginners to
10:16 - get to read lure and kind of understand
10:18 - it you know yeah it was like 14 at the
10:20 - time oh so you're saying you had your
10:23 - own servers is how you're using force
10:24 - yeah I had my own video game server
10:25 - running on it was a it's called a server
10:30 - list or whatever and people would like
10:32 - just from all over the world would go
10:33 - into the server and I the most the peak
10:36 - people that had the most people that had
10:38 - at one specific time was like ninety
10:40 - people live Wow no wonder is great it's
10:44 - creative for accessibility yeah yeah
10:46 - yeah you know like don't starve together
10:49 - this one is this game that I absolutely
10:51 - love on Steam
10:53 - play it like crazy or used to play like
10:55 - crazy dad I think is also built in Lua
10:57 - but even with that said it has a very
11:00 - stack like it's
11:01 - it's dropping down because now there are
11:03 - other programming languages that people
11:04 - are using you know like for example
11:07 - using Unity game engine and that's what
11:09 - we've got C++ C sharp C sharp C sure
11:12 - it's one of those but that's what people
11:14 - are using and they're not using Lua that
11:18 - much anymore so that's been that's been
11:21 - pretty much on the decline yeah can we
11:25 - look up on Google Trends wait what it's
11:28 - saying about Lua and so while you're
11:32 - doing that I'm actually looking at
11:33 - syntax and it's really interesting
11:35 - because it literally looks like Python
11:39 - it's got you know you got your prints it
11:41 - print hello world you know with the
11:43 - parentheses looks like actually Python 3
11:45 - so they thought ahead of the curve
11:47 - Python 3 just got the whole print
11:49 - parentheses hello world you know oh yeah
11:53 - and it's got functions and and you know
11:55 - for variable for variable you say you
11:56 - have something like local x equals 1
11:59 - you got your loops dang this is awesome
12:02 - yeah they got quite a lot if you
12:05 - actually if you go to like transit
12:07 - google.com right and you just if you go
12:11 - there and you can look at it and the
12:14 - growth of Python I mean obviously that's
12:19 - much more cuz that's the number one
12:20 - language especially right now too but
12:23 - when you look at Lua
12:24 - it had this little jump around right
12:28 - around 2009 it had that little spike but
12:32 - then after that it just started
12:34 - declining like crazy and I kid you not
12:37 - that's the time where I was playing with
12:38 - the server seriously I was eighth ninth
12:41 - grade yeah damn me so all that yeah
12:49 - there it is there it is there you go
12:51 - so whoa you can look at the trend line
12:54 - there and then if you if you click on
12:56 - the compare where it's like the plus
12:58 - sign compare right next to Lua yeah and
13:03 - you can type in Python there and then
13:05 - it'll allow you to see Lua compared with
13:08 - the Python
13:10 - and that will give you certain
13:13 - interestingly enough I'm looking at the
13:15 - sub-region right
13:16 - you've got Lula being used guess what is
13:18 - the number one region it's being used in
13:21 - or you know uh Lua well Oh Hawaii here's
13:25 - okay but now you really see that Lua you
13:28 - know it maybe have tiny little spike
13:31 - some points but it's pretty much been
13:34 - very low interest throughout like all
13:36 - the way through yeah yeah I'm the thing
13:38 - that's being used much and I mean ever
13:40 - right so they say there's a huge much
13:43 - more demand many more developers that
13:45 - know it then the demand for the jobs so
13:48 - that's why I would put this in top five
13:50 - worst programming languages because I
13:52 - think it's um yeah it's not that great
13:55 - so like probably avoid it if you can
13:58 - yeah yeah if you want to script just use
14:00 - Python that's right I'm still widget I'm
14:03 - still that still amazes me that still it
14:05 - looks pretty good in terms of syntax
14:06 - wise that's still the amazing part to me
14:09 - honestly it looks good syntax well like
14:11 - you know being developed in 1993 is is
14:13 - it functional or is it this obvious is
14:17 - functional because it's not a function
14:18 - no because well because you got your
14:21 - while you got your you got your you got
14:24 - your loops you got your okay its primary
14:27 - okay so Lua it's a lightweight
14:29 - high-level multi-paradigm programming
14:30 - language and it's designed for embedded
14:33 - use and applications
14:36 - I've curious what kind of locations now
14:40 - okay what
14:46 - oh yeah there we go that's another one
14:47 - yeah what did you get stuff can you
14:48 - build with Lua let's take a look at that
14:50 - oh yo you know roblox that we saw at
14:52 - VidCon that those people are talking
14:54 - about roblox game that's to keep you out
14:55 - of code that's based on Loula
14:57 - are you serious yeah pretty sure hold on
15:00 - so I'm looking at I'm looking right now
15:02 - at things that use Lua so video games is
15:05 - one other uses you got Adobe Photoshop
15:11 - Lightroom Apache HTTP server so yeah I'm
15:16 - looking at on Wikipedia other videos you
15:19 - have to be very careful where a spike
15:22 - database that's right oh yeah it's
15:24 - popping up that's awesome yeah awesome
15:26 - to have a TV you've got a Photoshop I
15:31 - was that's surprising right cheat engine
15:34 - Cisco yeah I was like whoa you're crying
15:39 - CryEngine yeah conky system monitoring
15:46 - that yeah I don't know what a lot of
15:47 - this damn small Linux you know Redis
15:50 - database dolphin computer no you know
15:53 - Redis like read Tuesday right yes yeah
15:55 - yeah yeah Redis is an open source
15:57 - database in which Lua can be used okay
16:00 - can be used in there interesting
16:02 - interesting
16:04 - okay so anyways if if you can avoid it
16:10 - avoid it unless there's a very specific
16:14 - use case that you're learning it for and
16:16 - the job you're trying to apply for like
16:18 - you're trying to work for some you know
16:20 - Adobe Photoshop it's very nice and you
16:24 - want so like yeah don't put effort into
16:26 - it unless it's very clear that you're
16:28 - gonna get a return right yeah I think
16:31 - it's using much anymore honestly okay
16:34 - let's move to top four worst horrible
16:39 - programming languages what do we got -
16:42 - four top four you know what I want to do
16:44 - a thing let's define what do you mean by
16:46 - worst by worst okay so that's a great
16:48 - thing so when what we're saying worst we
16:51 - were we gave it a lot of thought were
16:53 - thinking should we just put really
16:56 - garbage as a
16:57 - tarek programming languages and while we
16:59 - still plan to do that we wanted to put
17:01 - some programming languages that are just
17:03 - facing a sharp decline that way people
17:05 - can still resonate with it you know so
17:07 - if you're watching this video we want
17:09 - the people to go okay that I know about
17:11 - Lou or I know about this you know of
17:13 - course there's like worse programming
17:14 - languages than Lua like way worse that
17:16 - nobody is actually using but I feel like
17:19 - at certain times you get so esoteric
17:20 - that it's it's not that fun anymore you
17:22 - know so so it's a mixture of programming
17:26 - like declining and then few we're gonna
17:29 - kind of just throw out here for
17:30 - entertainment so people can can be you
17:33 - know yeah I'm crazy cuz there's so
17:36 - there's some really crazy ones out there
17:37 - yeah but that's what I mean by worse so
17:39 - that's what I'm I gotcha I gotcha I
17:40 - gotcha what would you say in terms of in
17:42 - terms that fine yeah yeah that's perfect
17:44 - that's perfect it's a number four worst
17:46 - programming language or Lang dump them
17:53 - down what do you got there no darling I
17:56 - don't know I'm reading the Kapiti right
17:58 - now let me see it is a general-purpose
18:01 - programming language and running
18:03 - environment oh that's a great
18:04 - explanation okay so this is a concurrent
18:07 - functional programming language um right
18:09 - off the bat one thing they kind of know
18:11 - it's like probably go is gonna be more
18:13 - popular right because go is a concurrent
18:15 - language and I believe go is is it also
18:17 - functional I don't believe so go is not
18:21 - functional yeah yeah too many but like
18:26 - Erlang is the main one we're looking at
18:34 - functional yeah okay so you have so go
18:38 - so if go as functional right and gore
18:40 - general purpose and if go as concurrent
18:42 - and it's super popular then this is
18:45 - probably gonna die off even more but
18:48 - let's look at like what kind of led to
18:50 - its decline
18:56 - Wow Ericsson is that like the company
19:00 - Ericsson you know like Sony Ericsson oh
19:03 - man there's like bunch of stuff that's
19:05 - pretty yeah it is it actually is the
19:07 - company Ericsson what do you mean like
19:11 - Sony Ericsson the ones who developed it
19:13 - yeah okay
19:15 - so few reason why Erlang is really bad
19:18 - right according to I'm reading a blog
19:20 - post by code mentor dot IO and the one
19:23 - of the reasons why they say it's really
19:25 - bad this is this is really nice graphic
19:28 - actually is it possible to put it pull
19:31 - that one up I think you would just type
19:35 - in code mentored i/o and then worst
19:38 - languages to learn and this brings up
19:41 - something pretty interesting mm-hmm
19:42 - so they go they talk about the worst
19:45 - programming and just learn 2018 but it's
19:47 - I think this applies for 2019 and most
19:50 - likely for 2022 and they have they've
19:54 - split it between community engagement
19:56 - job market and growth and trends and
19:59 - their community engagement is for Erlang
20:04 - is pretty bad they pretty low their job
20:08 - market for Erlang is actually very low
20:11 - as well so they're not a lot of job
20:12 - opportunities that exists so when it
20:15 - comes to like bad programming languages
20:17 - that you want to avoid you probably want
20:18 - to avoid languages that have lured low
20:24 - demand you know people paying less and
20:26 - then the growth and trend of Erlang is
20:29 - also dying too but what are you guys
20:31 - thoughts on it so I'm looking right now
20:35 - I looked at what companies used Erlang
20:38 - right and I'm gonna name a few so we've
20:41 - got name a few that my name a few that
20:44 - are pretty much known facebook facebook
20:47 - chat back and it still uses it looks
20:50 - like looks like it either uses it or
20:53 - used it I thought that I thought they
20:55 - used you should be PHP man I don't know
20:59 - I mean according I'm looking directly on
21:02 - Ireland org so you know their actual
21:05 - website and looks like pee so it's
21:07 - Facebook back-end they've also got watts
21:10 - messaging for smartphones they've got
21:12 - the whatsapp app as well hmm
21:15 - we've got a few ones that one app is
21:17 - written in early according to them which
21:22 - is weird
21:24 - probably features of it yeah holy moly
21:30 - well what's out five best thing is it's
21:37 - used for in the communication systems
21:39 - right you know you know and all these
21:41 - all these programs you know Facebook and
21:44 - whatsapp they're all telecommunications
21:46 - almost it's almost dinner look at that
21:50 - Wow as it was suitable for accommodating
21:52 - huge communication system with high
21:54 - sustainability there's a famous
21:57 - open-source jabber server written in
22:01 - Erlang over systems that do the backend
22:04 - message routing are done in Erlang God
22:07 - you didn't know that dude I am pretty
22:12 - blown away so maybe it's not the worst
22:18 - for programming languages just remove
22:23 - the worst part out okay so yeah there
22:32 - you go awful don't [ __ ] learn this so
22:34 - if you want to get a job at whatsapp
22:36 - learn early how many devs do they need
22:40 - for an app like that I mean actually
22:42 - usually the teams are fairly small right
22:43 - yeah I mean what like whatsapp or
22:46 - Facebook well I mean Facebook you know a
22:47 - lot but like what is what's up wonder
22:49 - Facebook it's not well no Facebook
22:50 - bought whatsapp did they yeah
22:53 - didn't know that yeah what's funny it's
22:54 - one of the workers from Facebook
22:56 - actually founded wet tops it's funny
22:58 - that like Facebook uses Erlang and then
22:59 - this guy in whatsapp uses Arlington yeah
23:02 - and he's like the guy election found
23:03 - face of what's up I think is actually
23:05 - Ukrainian - oh he actually didn't work
23:07 - for Facebook he wasn't he actually
23:09 - didn't pass the interview for face yeah
23:12 - yeah yeah yeah I remember that
23:13 - yeah yeah that's true that is true oh my
23:16 - gosh and then yeah and then they how
23:18 - much they end up buying what's up for
23:19 - was it 60 60 billion dollars I forgot
23:22 - 16:06 maybe that's it
23:24 - six billion I don't know check it out oh
23:30 - right there yeah well the what's that
23:34 - founders they they set the prices
23:36 - sixteen billion mmm-hmm but hey okay
23:41 - they paid twenty one okay so here are a
23:45 - few hypotheses for why this is pretty
23:49 - fascinating this is some article suppose
23:53 - somebody made on Y Combinator hacker
23:55 - news and it's like okay why isn't it
23:57 - popular and the guy says you know they
24:02 - go people say or Lang is being used for
24:06 - whatsapp and then people ask the
24:08 - question right after that they go why
24:09 - isn't it popular anymore that's kind of
24:11 - exactly what we're thinking right now
24:12 - it's like why isn't it popular anymore
24:14 - well they say that don't look at the
24:18 - language itself to get insight into why
24:20 - it's not popular look into the community
24:22 - for why it's not popular right make
24:24 - sense that's one big reason and then
24:26 - they gave like multiple other reasons
24:28 - like for example they don't have a
24:29 - package manager there are no open source
24:34 - packages there's no committees like
24:36 - everything has the open source package
24:38 - github is like a goldmine for JavaScript
24:41 - frameworks or whatever right they don't
24:42 - have open source packages they have no
24:46 - community site there are guns - no for
24:50 - loops wait what well you know listen
24:55 - yeah lists for Strings variables don't
24:58 - vary there are no docks or too many
25:02 - docks that are incorrect they're not
25:06 - enough teaching materials so it's just a
25:08 - regular language like a spoken language
25:09 - like what is this no documentation
25:13 - emacs's ID but that's crazy though like
25:21 - I mean if you don't like a potato well
25:23 - that's you know I mean the big part is
25:25 - you're right if you don't have a
25:26 - community around it then that's why it's
25:29 - a dying you know that's a very big part
25:30 - of a dying language the community as
25:33 - well makes anything really popular
25:35 - that's why Python is so big
25:37 - yeah cuz I mean like if it's a if it's a
25:39 - programming language then it can
25:40 - obviously create you can obviously
25:42 - create something with it so like it's
25:43 - not because it's like it's
25:44 - non-functional but like yeah energy use
25:46 - and and yeah so exactly so this is very
25:48 - fascinating I think we can learn a lot
25:51 - from just this I think it's just really
25:52 - interesting because a lot it's a lot
25:55 - about adoption of a language - it's not
25:57 - just how great it is or how great the
25:59 - features are a lot about the adoption
26:01 - cuz functionality-wise is incredible but
26:05 - some other things that people are
26:06 - hypothesis hypothesizing or like the
26:08 - syntax is weird not only in a paradigm
26:11 - way but the pattern matching to most
26:13 - other programming languages it doesn't
26:16 - match the pattern of how you write most
26:18 - of the programming languages which make
26:20 - looks wack the syntax looks really weird
26:22 - like I can't even there I can't even
26:23 - decipher it like what the heck is this
26:25 - by the way this is hot Thanks yeah
26:38 - syntax go ahead now go ahead you go
26:40 - ahead at your first so the syntax is
26:42 - really odd and it makes it so people
26:46 - can't just jump in the barrier of entry
26:49 - is very very high even for us I'm like
26:52 - I'm looking at I'm like what can I see
26:54 - some I mean looks like a receiving it
27:04 - receives the signal yeah you could just
27:05 - type in like Erlang syntax or something
27:08 - on him and then go to images and maybe
27:09 - something will come up and I feel like
27:12 - it's a very low level low level it's low
27:14 - level programming language okay so yes
27:17 - it's also a little bit low level I guess
27:21 - but I think the adoptability is the main
27:24 - main thing yeah I'm surprised of what's
27:28 - for what's that using it home yeah well
27:30 - like look at the some of the syntax
27:31 - right it's weird it's like word count
27:35 - well well I mean it it is not tearing
27:39 - yeah look I love it's like halfway
27:41 - between like Java bytecode or like
27:44 - assembly and a high level it's like
27:46 - halfway between because there's weird
27:47 - jump statements and stuff yes jump
27:50 - statements one
27:51 - like it says like to go back to the top
27:53 - of a loop you can link loop back up with
27:55 - him let's let's guess let's guess what's
27:58 - going on in there well I mean I guess it
28:00 - just by looking at the function name in
28:01 - one I know what's going on they are
28:04 - doing they're updating word count I
28:10 - don't know dude look you got a table is
28:15 - that like an empty array line 29 looking
28:18 - up a word I don't know what so what okay
28:22 - who is up for learning this language for
28:25 - 24 hours and then we make a video on it
28:27 - do that's interesting people vote on
28:30 - that idea then yeah you should actually
28:33 - choose all five okay choose one of the
28:35 - five and we'll do yeah just one of them
28:36 - front verse five and then the one that
28:38 - gets the most up votes yeah we'll spend
28:40 - 24 hours learning it doesn't be above
28:42 - like 20 or 30 up vote and well maybe
28:44 - this will make the next Facebook but the
28:47 - order what's that I was getting yeah out
28:49 - of void space so as you unconvincingly
28:54 - saw it's a bad language don't learn it
29:00 - unless you want to work for horribly
29:04 - awesome companies like whatsapp yeah
29:06 - yeah no she's actually Facebook again
29:09 - the main thing is the adaptability of it
29:11 - is low which makes it so the future and
29:14 - the trend of it is not as high so of
29:17 - course there's some specialized
29:18 - companies you could work for whatsapp
29:20 - and probably some others but you if you
29:22 - want to look at the longevity of it it's
29:25 - not gonna be that high and because it's
29:26 - the here's here's why you'd rather learn
29:29 - Lua over this is because Luis still
29:32 - probably like most other languages so
29:34 - when you learn it you can still pick up
29:36 - lots of other languages this I feel like
29:38 - will leave you in a place where it
29:41 - doesn't really apply to many other
29:43 - things you only learn this like if
29:45 - you're doing something very specific
29:46 - like don't start with this this is this
29:48 - would correct it's not something yeah
29:50 - because for example if you pick up
29:52 - JavaScript as your first programming
29:53 - language or Python or Java well you
29:56 - could still pick up all the other
29:57 - languages pretty easily but if you pick
30:00 - up like machine code is your first
30:03 - language that's not gonna really
30:04 - translate
30:04 - to any other language but you know the
30:07 - interesting part is like a lot of these
30:09 - languages they're really not used a lot
30:12 - they actually pay a lot of money like in
30:15 - terms of work like work wise because not
30:18 - a lot of people there may be a little
30:20 - demand for them right but there's also
30:22 - very little supply I have I had back in
30:25 - college I had as a friend of mine and he
30:29 - told me about how you know for example
30:31 - think Ford or GM they're looking for
30:33 - COBOL COBOL
30:34 - yeah like COBOL engineers and they were
30:36 - ready to pay like 200k or something just
30:39 - for a COBOL engineer you know right and
30:41 - that's because there aren't a lot of a
30:42 - lot of them good but doesn't say that
30:44 - doesn't you know right I'm not saying
30:46 - like go you need to learn it I'm just
30:47 - this is just an interesting perspective
30:48 - right so it's kind of like how clothes
30:52 - they're in fashion then they go out of
30:54 - fashion and then they're so old that
30:56 - they come back in fashion again yeah I
30:59 - mean if you want to play that gamble
31:01 - that's fine but I feel like most of the
31:04 - times is that it's like a gamble so yeah
31:08 - I imagine there's give me some educates
31:10 - people who will benefit off of it but I
31:12 - feel like majority of the people
31:13 - probably not benefit out of it I'm
31:16 - looking monster 77 Jobs found from early
31:19 - all right let's move to the third
31:22 - today's which one should we go it should
31:25 - we go with trump script yeah let's just
31:27 - stick to letting do the order will be
31:28 - picked earlier
31:29 - all right sweet let's go number two top
31:32 - third worst programming language Trump
31:35 - script alright so this language how do
31:39 - you have to end the script you have to
31:40 - end it with like make America great
31:42 - again right that's how you officially
31:44 - end uh
31:44 - may you know I'm looking at this
31:46 - Christian make Python great yeah make
31:47 - Python great again I think that's how
31:49 - you end every it's written in Python
31:53 - yeah which is awesome it's literally
31:57 - just part-time I use you just have to
31:59 - end the script with that I'm trying to
32:01 - find something on it oh that's so
32:05 - interesting is it just literally Python
32:09 - yeah there you go
32:11 - oh I think let's do the second I think
32:16 - we let's go with the Virg
32:18 - one second one no not that I think
32:21 - there's another one by the verge there
32:23 - let's click on that the Donald Trump
32:27 - programming language is not for dummies
32:29 - or losers love the headline main coding
32:38 - nice tagline okay so there's a part
32:41 - where it goes
32:44 - it goes like for example if you use a
32:46 - word that's been banned the error
32:48 - message will read we're all have to
32:50 - scroll down a little bit there yeah it's
32:51 - like that like whole section with the
32:54 - error message will read Trump doesn't
32:57 - want to hear it or if you use a word
33:01 - that's not common it will say we have a
33:04 - country where it is similar you have to
33:06 - speak there's some more features of
33:12 - Trump scripts so for example no
33:13 - floating-point numbers only integers
33:15 - because America thank you yeah so the
33:19 - idea behind not having any floating
33:21 - numbers and only integers is because
33:22 - America never does anything halfway all
33:26 - numbers must be strictly greater than 1
33:28 - million the small stuff is in constant
33:32 - and there are no important code has to
33:44 - be homegrown and american-made and in
33:48 - its raw form
33:49 - Trump's crit is not compatible with
33:51 - windows because isn't the guy isn't the
33:54 - type of guy to believe in PC yeah so if
34:08 - you sorry just one more time if we sell
34:12 - just a little bit down you'll have the
34:13 - first working Trump script so save roses
34:20 - are red say violets are blue if lies say
34:24 - if I can beat Hillary says so can you
34:27 - what and then you gotta end it with
34:31 - America's great so this is Trump dot txt
34:34 - Wow
34:36 - this guy even wrote this for us on
34:38 - github Wow now I'm actually gonna go to
34:41 - their Trump probably paid to develop
34:43 - this language you know you know when it
34:45 - came out I was gonna make a video on it
34:47 - right when it came out why didn't it
34:49 - come out by the way they know a few
34:51 - years ago because running it says
35:00 - features error messages are mostly
35:02 - quotes directly taken from Trump himself
35:07 - only the most say only the most popular
35:12 - English words Trump's favorite words and
35:14 - current politician names can be used as
35:16 - variable names the other one is like
35:21 - said if the running computer is from
35:23 - China Donald Trump's curb will not
35:24 - compile are you serious dude somebody
35:29 - went really far with this like it
35:33 - probably checks for IP addresses you
35:34 - know instead of true and false we have
35:36 - the keywords fact and lie won't run in
35:42 - rube mode because America doesn't need
35:44 - your help being great trump is all we
35:46 - need oh my gosh is the only key value
35:48 - pair Trump and Putin interesting I'm
35:58 - curious like why why why people like
36:00 - what inspires people to come up with
36:02 - this kind of stuff you know exactly I
36:05 - mean it's Trump somebody was probably
36:08 - emotional by constructing a wall
36:11 - aka by providing the wall flag so in
36:15 - terminal I think you can pass a flag
36:17 - when you're writing a command in a
36:18 - command line you get past a wall flag if
36:20 - you do that it says Trump's script will
36:22 - refuse to run on machines with Mexican
36:25 - locales man the Mexican developers star
36:33 - probably yes if you if you run like
36:34 - Python example dot py and then before
36:37 - you hit enter you you do - hi
36:39 - you passed a wall flag it will it will
36:42 - if it's a Mexican machine yes so what is
36:51 - the point of this language is it like
36:52 - can you actually build stuff with it
36:53 - usually just I'm sure you can yeah you
36:56 - just you just try it as long as you're
36:58 - not on the windows and it makes a call
37:00 - in Mexico or China or China I'll be
37:04 - tough all right well we should move on
37:10 - to the next one I think we're coming up
37:11 - with an hour soon I'm not sure well okay
37:15 - all right we'll probably got to move
37:16 - faster than yeah and it's easy to type
37:19 - with small hands that's another feature
37:21 - I just saw that okay
37:26 - so language let's move on to number two
37:29 - worse programming language whitespace
37:33 - all right so what's crazy about this
37:35 - whitespace programming language if we
37:37 - pull up whitespace syntax I'll pull it
37:39 - up to right space sounds like a horror
37:44 - movie
37:46 - it's it's made up of just whitespace
37:49 - there there's nothing so like it's
37:51 - showing you all that color but that just
37:53 - means that they're highlighting it how
37:55 - it actually looks like it's just blank
37:57 - there's no letters there no words
37:59 - nothing it's nothing
38:01 - yeah it's just tabs and spaces yeah the
38:03 - entire language so if you scroll down a
38:05 - little bit scroll down more more you're
38:09 - gonna see a document that has nothing on
38:11 - it scroll probably yeah that's actually
38:15 - what the language is doing you literally
38:17 - have to highlight what you wrote to see
38:19 - what you wrote correct Wow but even then
38:21 - you can't really see yeah borders
38:24 - weights do you have to count like how
38:27 - much white space like yeah why space
38:29 - tabs and new lines is how you write code
38:31 - in it not trying to be disrespectful or
38:34 - anything but with this work with like
38:35 - blind people or something because it's
38:37 - like are you gonna say black people that
38:39 - would yeah of course would work with
38:43 - blind people all they it would blind
38:46 - people it would work better than jobs
38:48 - with white person because you're
38:49 - clicking a time to them it's no
38:51 - different than Python or something
38:53 - they're already using drill to them
38:57 - they're already feeling it
38:59 - any feedback we can get on this anybody
39:01 - that's playing that it has a little bit
39:02 - of a reference experience with
39:04 - whitespace talk about a head scratcher
39:05 - man like talk about like you know how
39:07 - much oh my gosh trying to write
39:09 - something like this you're gonna be
39:11 - frustrated all the time really hard is
39:14 - if you get a git diff or after you do a
39:16 - git merge with somebody's code and if to
39:18 - update it that would be a nightmare
39:20 - because when you're showing when they're
39:22 - showing the git diff they also have
39:23 - highlight the white spaces it's like oh
39:25 - man this guy just added all this new
39:27 - colors I'm like - oh forget it approved
39:30 - yeah when you push it it's like oh man
39:32 - it sounds like a nightmare but one cool
39:34 - thing I just read on the Wikipedia page
39:35 - is um it's pretty much like the opposite
39:38 - of all other programming languages
39:39 - because you know most programming
39:40 - languages it ignores all the white space
39:42 - curve this one ignores any non-white
39:44 - space yeah therefore you can actually
39:45 - write programs in a normal program link
39:47 - oh it's white space embedded in Python
39:50 - so this way this would be great for
39:52 - hackers but yeah they can do is they can
39:54 - write look like non-middle moon not a
39:56 - little non-malicious looking code in
39:59 - Python or something
40:00 - it's like printer script but it's
40:03 - actually white yeah using so it only
40:06 - entered the compiler only laser would
40:09 - know would need to know how to run white
40:11 - space right
40:11 - OS X would need to not hurt anybody it's
40:13 - a good program thanks for the in for
40:14 - like the secret code or something right
40:16 - it's like a it's like a little like
40:18 - Morse code as a programming yeah I was
40:20 - like what are they the CIA uses it or
40:22 - something you know I doubt it they're
40:24 - probably not smart enough to use it
40:27 - okay probably because we're a long time
40:29 - let's move on to the number one worst
40:33 - programming language on the planet this
40:35 - will hurt your brain make you cry make
40:37 - you weep it's called what is it called
40:41 - the brain [ __ ] literally yeah that is B
40:48 - are AI n f uck
40:51 - that's correct rain fallin word brain
40:53 - fog programming language I think the
40:55 - intention of the programming language is
40:56 - in the word you know yep and the idea of
41:01 - this programming language to be as
41:02 - esoteric ask complex as
41:06 - um as complicated as possible yep brain
41:10 - fog look at that code that was designed
41:12 - to hurt yeah one of the most frustrating
41:15 - programming languages was built that way
41:18 - on purpose but for a whole idea on yeah
41:21 - so it looks like really painful code
41:24 - that's a great article I think if you
41:25 - scroll down on that one it shows like
41:27 - how some of the code looks 2 by E so
41:31 - lingers is this like a thing it was
41:35 - create a 93 thousand by Swiss physics
41:38 - student named urban Mueller Mueller
41:40 - Mueller hmm I mean it was it was an
41:46 - attempt to create a language with the
41:48 - smallest possible compiler so it was
41:49 - actually like something making the code
41:53 - is hard for humans right but easy as
41:55 - easy as possible for computer like most
41:56 - efficient compiler but it's tearin
41:58 - complete so it actually it can actually
42:00 - write real code and do real stuff can we
42:04 - actually see some syntax that'd be
42:05 - interesting maybe maybe this article
42:08 - does not have syntax right there I
42:09 - imagined it right there oh my gosh so to
42:12 - write hello world this is was how you
42:15 - write it would look like so just
42:19 - listening to this go ahead confused
42:27 - imagine making your Python Django apps
42:29 - with that big so like if it's for
42:32 - anybody who's just listening you would
42:34 - normally write print hello world but in
42:35 - brain [ __ ] you would write like plus
42:37 - plus plus plus bracket greater in the
42:39 - side and period and the crazy stuff what
42:46 - is this so laters another programming
42:49 - language called or rant or Angleton
42:50 - words or anger ten words and it's a spin
42:54 - so brain [ __ ] is a spin off of that
42:56 - language and in that language every
42:59 - character is just the word that's every
43:05 - single word is like that curse how how
43:07 - here's another programming let's call
43:09 - chef which is pretty awesome and
43:10 - everything has to be written like a
43:12 - recipe oh yeah have you seen it
43:15 - yeah yeah I think you went over that
43:16 - yeah everything is run like a recipe and
43:18 - then that's not for
43:19 - oops to like put two tablespoons and
43:22 - then like repeat it yeah everything's
43:25 - related to like cooking looks like a
43:26 - Gordon Ramsay Channel everything yeah
43:28 - but yeah for this language it's just
43:30 - designed to hurt your brain as much as
43:32 - possible and I don't have somebody's
43:35 - ever made programs with this like it's a
43:40 - very low lingual low leg low low level
43:42 - language yeah where you know you're
43:45 - doing with pointers a lot you know you
43:48 - adding your pointer you're in committing
43:50 - porn decreasing your pointer you to
43:52 - check this out okay
43:53 - brain [ __ ] is the ungodly creation of
43:55 - urban Muller whose goal was apparently
43:57 - to create a Turing complete language for
43:59 - which he could write the smallest
44:00 - compiler ever for the Amiga OS 2.0 Amiga
44:06 - ran in Spanish right with a non non
44:10 - cultural people yeah writing compilers
44:12 - sucks
44:13 - you've written a compiler yeah yeah yeah
44:19 - so there you guys have it the top five
44:22 - worst programming languages to learn in
44:25 - 2020 and beyond probably I mean I don't
44:28 - know how far beyond maybe brain [ __ ]
44:30 - the look on the number one most
44:32 - programmers but I am willing to say on
44:34 - record that it won't no probably still
44:36 - be awful and that's it I hope you guys
44:40 - enjoyed the show learn more popular
44:42 - languages like Python or JavaScript or
44:44 - Java or something that's really relevant
44:46 - let us know what programming language
44:48 - was the worst to you so we can create
44:50 - something with it yeah we'll spin we'll
44:55 - spend 24 hours all learning that
44:57 - language and then develop something
44:58 - we'll go to his loft just let's not do
45:04 - brave [ __ ] that like that I feel like
45:05 - that's gonna be a really hard one yeah
45:07 - let's not do that let's do something
45:09 - that'll be like entertaining for them to
45:10 - watch to some script yeah that's better
45:14 - all right guys thank you so much for

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys this is Kazi here from clever programmer comm today we're doing something very very fascinating first of all we're gonna be talking about the top 5 worst programming languages in 2020 so that's gonna be really exciting when we're talking about all kinds of crazy programming languages from brain fog to whitespace to wall code to Trump scripts to whatever else and we're doing something really fascinating which is that we are in a podcast studio and we have a team of four people today Before we jump right into it I do want to mention that we have a threepart master class if you just put in your email we send it to you right away it's absolutely free it's filled with a lot of value and you're gonna learn a lot about programming so you can go from zero to knowing how to become a sixfigure developer or a freelancer it lays out the path for you so please put in your email for that it's it's gonna be in the description below as well or you can just go to clever programmer comm and sign up for free with that said let's jump right into this podcast so you guys probably know Aaron we got Frankie in the house yo and we go knows hello hello how's it going everybody dumansky yes nas is a special guest here from Detroit Michigan he's a developer he's a django developer he's a badass freelancer and so we're gonna be learning a lot of things and we shouldn't be kicking back relaxing and having a lot of fun so welcome thank you thank you for having me I appreciate it this is awesome a young cat 224 what's up successful freelance for 24 huh well yeah still learning a lot still learning a lot so nas talk to me how you got into freelancing a little bit you know just so people can get a little bit of context like just talk about how you got into freelancing yeah and of what you've accomplished so far with it just a little bit of a recap so people know yeah so something I've been developing for about seven years now right so started back in high school that kind of worked the work that startups work the corporations and for the past for the past like you know two years I've worked at a startup called kind of service calm and yeah and and seven months ago like I decided to quit I decided to quit because I want to try something else and with the chest something different and I wasn't really really excited about where where I was going so and all of a sudden I was like you know what this is something I need to try this is something need to do as I just decided to quit and there we go here we are right now for the past seven months it has been an interesting journey had to learn a lot of things and it was definitely difficult and it still it still really is difficult but but you know it's amazing to have the freedom that you get from something like this and to learn so much because now not only you are as are you a developer but you are kind of a businessperson right your sales guy your your manager right you're thinking about so many different things and itself that that is the interesting part too right yeah you got to do a little bit of everything and especially when you're doing because you said you started working in startups yeah you kind of got to do a little bit of everything in a startup you're wearing lots of different hats I mean just like ask these guys you know Frankie and Aaron I mean how many hats do you guys have to wear working in a working in a startup he wears a lot you get to touch a lot of different um a lot of different topics really like I started off as a video editor and stuff now we do a bunch of I don't know philia marketing things and we all kind of get to know what each other is doing so you know you kind of jump into other fields and stuff and it's cool because you kind of get to know what else you're made of you know not just like like what I see in nas is like this guy's like super into development but I also see him just ease when like I see a lot of developers and a lot of times these guys I don't wanna you know generalize but a lot of times developers are a little bit more lowenergy asked to say and there have a little bit of trouble expressing themselves and I see Naz talking about something like SEO which is not even like completely related to development or at all but he's just [ __ ] passion kinase where you passionate and stuff and it's it's contagious you know and it's a [ __ ] swear on this podcast okay yeah but those qualities I feel are great for like freelancing and stuff and those qualities are also great for small companies you know yeah I think well communication I think one of the things you mentioned communication being able to communicate properly is one of the biggest qualities in itself and a developer how can anybody else right especially as a developer a communication quality being able to communicate between the developers the business people right right that is a very big quality that a lot is underrated right but with it with it you can go very far so far right like communication is very important the octa MIMO communication well I probably the worst communication yeah I communicate about it I mean it's important you have to be on a team like that this is actually the first real like legit team I've been on besides like you know soccer teams and stupid school projects that don't really count like I never actually had that you got a communicating little blow with everybody but even with like communicating with like other people like you guys how many hats you go where I think we all wear every hat like at some point yeah we're all learning everything yeah some of us are better than others but yeah communication is so important like that's why I got on the team in the first place I found you guys just communication right it's important yeah like when it comes to for example for developers to land a job you can't take me you gotta reach out that's one communication and you gotta be able to actually land the contract and then keep the client that requires communication and most people either they can't get a client lack of communication in that place and then they can't keep a client a lot of the times and most of the time that happens because they've either lost the trust or didn't follow up or whatever the case may be yeah and also this is how deals happen we were watching this crazy ass show of recently men who built America [ __ ] awesome show amazing it's such an amazing show and in they're talking about Vanderbilt and Rockefeller who built you know according to today it would he would be worth what two hundred twenty five billion dollars at the time this guy communicated with Vanderbilt and he wasn't scared and he could withstand the pressure and he was in that moment he made the deal this happens a lot of times with developers way where they're afraid to negotiate for what they want yeah they are afraid to withstand the pressure they could be working for a company for like ten twenty years but they're they're pretty afraid to go up to their boss and be like hey can I make like ten dollars more man per hour it's actually it's great thing you mentioned that right because you know being able to kind of stand up for yourself and to communicate that so you know I've worked with different people and and there's a difference between you can have a developer who was just as good as another developer right but if that one developer is able to go out there and is not afraid to kind of put himself out there and you know go to the CEO and ask for my money for example right he will actually be he will actually be able to go much further and someone who's just kind of scared and it's still at the same level like you know still the same level knowledge wise and experience wise the guy who was able to ask and to demand right will be able to go much further much further yeah okay with that let's get into the languages okay so let's let's start with this so this but this was a lot of good stuff that we're talking about we continue to talk about this type of fascinating stuff but let's give people what they really came for all right so top five worst programming languages number five drum bro which one is it you said we're starting with Lou alright that's pretty good yeah I don't even know what it is alright so I just heard it was bet yeah it's a bad language man it's it's a high level programming language mmhmm right Lua is a powerful and fast programming language that is easy to learn use and embed in your application all right good marketing yeah design in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to me demand of customization at the time oh they got cuz they had customizations at the time there that's possible dang focus of approving speed and probability and accessibility the only time I've actually heard about Lua is the only experience I have had with it is running a video game server I don't know if people know this game but it's a really popular game in Europe it's called tibia it's a mmm mmm Oh RPG and these guys are it's like a 2d universe or world or whatever and it's funny because I mean just graphically it's not that hard to recreate the game or whatever but the way that you would change like the values of like items like let's say armor is 15 or 14 or whatever and I hope I'm not like geeking out too much but like you can not everybody who's a program yeah exactly so you would go into the Lua files and I would actually change the scripts on just notepad I would open them up on notepad and change the scripts there change the values from like Armour 15 to 17 and then it would change that inside the game you [ __ ] cheater yeah it was my universe it was my server so people would play under my rules so I would choose what type of you know what type of oh that's awesome yeah and and that's how I actually got to know Lua I didn't even know was a language I thought it was a phone extension by the way guys everybody's a developer here yeah but go ahead but yeah that's that's pretty much what I know about it and I honestly I knew nothing about code I didn't even know it was coding but it's actually pretty easy for beginners to get to read lure and kind of understand it you know yeah it was like 14 at the time oh so you're saying you had your own servers is how you're using force yeah I had my own video game server running on it was a it's called a server list or whatever and people would like just from all over the world would go into the server and I the most the peak people that had the most people that had at one specific time was like ninety people live Wow no wonder is great it's creative for accessibility yeah yeah yeah you know like don't starve together this one is this game that I absolutely love on Steam play it like crazy or used to play like crazy dad I think is also built in Lua but even with that said it has a very stack like it's it's dropping down because now there are other programming languages that people are using you know like for example using Unity game engine and that's what we've got C++ C sharp C sharp C sure it's one of those but that's what people are using and they're not using Lua that much anymore so that's been that's been pretty much on the decline yeah can we look up on Google Trends wait what it's saying about Lua and so while you're doing that I'm actually looking at syntax and it's really interesting because it literally looks like Python it's got you know you got your prints it print hello world you know with the parentheses looks like actually Python 3 so they thought ahead of the curve Python 3 just got the whole print parentheses hello world you know oh yeah and it's got functions and and you know for variable for variable you say you have something like local x equals 1 you got your loops dang this is awesome yeah they got quite a lot if you actually if you go to like transit google.com right and you just if you go there and you can look at it and the growth of Python I mean obviously that's much more cuz that's the number one language especially right now too but when you look at Lua it had this little jump around right around 2009 it had that little spike but then after that it just started declining like crazy and I kid you not that's the time where I was playing with the server seriously I was eighth ninth grade yeah damn me so all that yeah there it is there it is there you go so whoa you can look at the trend line there and then if you if you click on the compare where it's like the plus sign compare right next to Lua yeah and you can type in Python there and then it'll allow you to see Lua compared with the Python and that will give you certain interestingly enough I'm looking at the subregion right you've got Lula being used guess what is the number one region it's being used in or you know uh Lua well Oh Hawaii here's okay but now you really see that Lua you know it maybe have tiny little spike some points but it's pretty much been very low interest throughout like all the way through yeah yeah I'm the thing that's being used much and I mean ever right so they say there's a huge much more demand many more developers that know it then the demand for the jobs so that's why I would put this in top five worst programming languages because I think it's um yeah it's not that great so like probably avoid it if you can yeah yeah if you want to script just use Python that's right I'm still widget I'm still that still amazes me that still it looks pretty good in terms of syntax wise that's still the amazing part to me honestly it looks good syntax well like you know being developed in 1993 is is it functional or is it this obvious is functional because it's not a function no because well because you got your while you got your you got your you got your loops you got your okay its primary okay so Lua it's a lightweight highlevel multiparadigm programming language and it's designed for embedded use and applications I've curious what kind of locations now okay what oh yeah there we go that's another one yeah what did you get stuff can you build with Lua let's take a look at that oh yo you know roblox that we saw at VidCon that those people are talking about roblox game that's to keep you out of code that's based on Loula are you serious yeah pretty sure hold on so I'm looking at I'm looking right now at things that use Lua so video games is one other uses you got Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Apache HTTP server so yeah I'm looking at on Wikipedia other videos you have to be very careful where a spike database that's right oh yeah it's popping up that's awesome yeah awesome to have a TV you've got a Photoshop I was that's surprising right cheat engine Cisco yeah I was like whoa you're crying CryEngine yeah conky system monitoring that yeah I don't know what a lot of this damn small Linux you know Redis database dolphin computer no you know Redis like read Tuesday right yes yeah yeah yeah Redis is an open source database in which Lua can be used okay can be used in there interesting interesting okay so anyways if if you can avoid it avoid it unless there's a very specific use case that you're learning it for and the job you're trying to apply for like you're trying to work for some you know Adobe Photoshop it's very nice and you want so like yeah don't put effort into it unless it's very clear that you're gonna get a return right yeah I think it's using much anymore honestly okay let's move to top four worst horrible programming languages what do we got four top four you know what I want to do a thing let's define what do you mean by worst by worst okay so that's a great thing so when what we're saying worst we were we gave it a lot of thought were thinking should we just put really garbage as a tarek programming languages and while we still plan to do that we wanted to put some programming languages that are just facing a sharp decline that way people can still resonate with it you know so if you're watching this video we want the people to go okay that I know about Lou or I know about this you know of course there's like worse programming languages than Lua like way worse that nobody is actually using but I feel like at certain times you get so esoteric that it's it's not that fun anymore you know so so it's a mixture of programming like declining and then few we're gonna kind of just throw out here for entertainment so people can can be you know yeah I'm crazy cuz there's so there's some really crazy ones out there yeah but that's what I mean by worse so that's what I'm I gotcha I gotcha I gotcha what would you say in terms of in terms that fine yeah yeah that's perfect that's perfect it's a number four worst programming language or Lang dump them down what do you got there no darling I don't know I'm reading the Kapiti right now let me see it is a generalpurpose programming language and running environment oh that's a great explanation okay so this is a concurrent functional programming language um right off the bat one thing they kind of know it's like probably go is gonna be more popular right because go is a concurrent language and I believe go is is it also functional I don't believe so go is not functional yeah yeah too many but like Erlang is the main one we're looking at functional yeah okay so you have so go so if go as functional right and gore general purpose and if go as concurrent and it's super popular then this is probably gonna die off even more but let's look at like what kind of led to its decline Wow Ericsson is that like the company Ericsson you know like Sony Ericsson oh man there's like bunch of stuff that's pretty yeah it is it actually is the company Ericsson what do you mean like Sony Ericsson the ones who developed it yeah okay so few reason why Erlang is really bad right according to I'm reading a blog post by code mentor dot IO and the one of the reasons why they say it's really bad this is this is really nice graphic actually is it possible to put it pull that one up I think you would just type in code mentored i/o and then worst languages to learn and this brings up something pretty interesting mmhmm so they go they talk about the worst programming and just learn 2018 but it's I think this applies for 2019 and most likely for 2022 and they have they've split it between community engagement job market and growth and trends and their community engagement is for Erlang is pretty bad they pretty low their job market for Erlang is actually very low as well so they're not a lot of job opportunities that exists so when it comes to like bad programming languages that you want to avoid you probably want to avoid languages that have lured low demand you know people paying less and then the growth and trend of Erlang is also dying too but what are you guys thoughts on it so I'm looking right now I looked at what companies used Erlang right and I'm gonna name a few so we've got name a few that my name a few that are pretty much known facebook facebook chat back and it still uses it looks like looks like it either uses it or used it I thought that I thought they used you should be PHP man I don't know I mean according I'm looking directly on Ireland org so you know their actual website and looks like pee so it's Facebook backend they've also got watts messaging for smartphones they've got the whatsapp app as well hmm we've got a few ones that one app is written in early according to them which is weird probably features of it yeah holy moly well what's out five best thing is it's used for in the communication systems right you know you know and all these all these programs you know Facebook and whatsapp they're all telecommunications almost it's almost dinner look at that Wow as it was suitable for accommodating huge communication system with high sustainability there's a famous opensource jabber server written in Erlang over systems that do the backend message routing are done in Erlang God you didn't know that dude I am pretty blown away so maybe it's not the worst for programming languages just remove the worst part out okay so yeah there you go awful don't [ __ ] learn this so if you want to get a job at whatsapp learn early how many devs do they need for an app like that I mean actually usually the teams are fairly small right yeah I mean what like whatsapp or Facebook well I mean Facebook you know a lot but like what is what's up wonder Facebook it's not well no Facebook bought whatsapp did they yeah didn't know that yeah what's funny it's one of the workers from Facebook actually founded wet tops it's funny that like Facebook uses Erlang and then this guy in whatsapp uses Arlington yeah and he's like the guy election found face of what's up I think is actually Ukrainian oh he actually didn't work for Facebook he wasn't he actually didn't pass the interview for face yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember that yeah yeah that's true that is true oh my gosh and then yeah and then they how much they end up buying what's up for was it 60 60 billion dollars I forgot 1606 maybe that's it six billion I don't know check it out oh right there yeah well the what's that founders they they set the prices sixteen billion mmmhmm but hey okay they paid twenty one okay so here are a few hypotheses for why this is pretty fascinating this is some article suppose somebody made on Y Combinator hacker news and it's like okay why isn't it popular and the guy says you know they go people say or Lang is being used for whatsapp and then people ask the question right after that they go why isn't it popular anymore that's kind of exactly what we're thinking right now it's like why isn't it popular anymore well they say that don't look at the language itself to get insight into why it's not popular look into the community for why it's not popular right make sense that's one big reason and then they gave like multiple other reasons like for example they don't have a package manager there are no open source packages there's no committees like everything has the open source package github is like a goldmine for JavaScript frameworks or whatever right they don't have open source packages they have no community site there are guns no for loops wait what well you know listen yeah lists for Strings variables don't vary there are no docks or too many docks that are incorrect they're not enough teaching materials so it's just a regular language like a spoken language like what is this no documentation emacs's ID but that's crazy though like I mean if you don't like a potato well that's you know I mean the big part is you're right if you don't have a community around it then that's why it's a dying you know that's a very big part of a dying language the community as well makes anything really popular that's why Python is so big yeah cuz I mean like if it's a if it's a programming language then it can obviously create you can obviously create something with it so like it's not because it's like it's nonfunctional but like yeah energy use and and yeah so exactly so this is very fascinating I think we can learn a lot from just this I think it's just really interesting because a lot it's a lot about adoption of a language it's not just how great it is or how great the features are a lot about the adoption cuz functionalitywise is incredible but some other things that people are hypothesis hypothesizing or like the syntax is weird not only in a paradigm way but the pattern matching to most other programming languages it doesn't match the pattern of how you write most of the programming languages which make looks wack the syntax looks really weird like I can't even there I can't even decipher it like what the heck is this by the way this is hot Thanks yeah syntax go ahead now go ahead you go ahead at your first so the syntax is really odd and it makes it so people can't just jump in the barrier of entry is very very high even for us I'm like I'm looking at I'm like what can I see some I mean looks like a receiving it receives the signal yeah you could just type in like Erlang syntax or something on him and then go to images and maybe something will come up and I feel like it's a very low level low level it's low level programming language okay so yes it's also a little bit low level I guess but I think the adoptability is the main main thing yeah I'm surprised of what's for what's that using it home yeah well like look at the some of the syntax right it's weird it's like word count well well I mean it it is not tearing yeah look I love it's like halfway between like Java bytecode or like assembly and a high level it's like halfway between because there's weird jump statements and stuff yes jump statements one like it says like to go back to the top of a loop you can link loop back up with him let's let's guess let's guess what's going on in there well I mean I guess it just by looking at the function name in one I know what's going on they are doing they're updating word count I don't know dude look you got a table is that like an empty array line 29 looking up a word I don't know what so what okay who is up for learning this language for 24 hours and then we make a video on it do that's interesting people vote on that idea then yeah you should actually choose all five okay choose one of the five and we'll do yeah just one of them front verse five and then the one that gets the most up votes yeah we'll spend 24 hours learning it doesn't be above like 20 or 30 up vote and well maybe this will make the next Facebook but the order what's that I was getting yeah out of void space so as you unconvincingly saw it's a bad language don't learn it unless you want to work for horribly awesome companies like whatsapp yeah yeah no she's actually Facebook again the main thing is the adaptability of it is low which makes it so the future and the trend of it is not as high so of course there's some specialized companies you could work for whatsapp and probably some others but you if you want to look at the longevity of it it's not gonna be that high and because it's the here's here's why you'd rather learn Lua over this is because Luis still probably like most other languages so when you learn it you can still pick up lots of other languages this I feel like will leave you in a place where it doesn't really apply to many other things you only learn this like if you're doing something very specific like don't start with this this is this would correct it's not something yeah because for example if you pick up JavaScript as your first programming language or Python or Java well you could still pick up all the other languages pretty easily but if you pick up like machine code is your first language that's not gonna really translate to any other language but you know the interesting part is like a lot of these languages they're really not used a lot they actually pay a lot of money like in terms of work like work wise because not a lot of people there may be a little demand for them right but there's also very little supply I have I had back in college I had as a friend of mine and he told me about how you know for example think Ford or GM they're looking for COBOL COBOL yeah like COBOL engineers and they were ready to pay like 200k or something just for a COBOL engineer you know right and that's because there aren't a lot of a lot of them good but doesn't say that doesn't you know right I'm not saying like go you need to learn it I'm just this is just an interesting perspective right so it's kind of like how clothes they're in fashion then they go out of fashion and then they're so old that they come back in fashion again yeah I mean if you want to play that gamble that's fine but I feel like most of the times is that it's like a gamble so yeah I imagine there's give me some educates people who will benefit off of it but I feel like majority of the people probably not benefit out of it I'm looking monster 77 Jobs found from early all right let's move to the third today's which one should we go it should we go with trump script yeah let's just stick to letting do the order will be picked earlier all right sweet let's go number two top third worst programming language Trump script alright so this language how do you have to end the script you have to end it with like make America great again right that's how you officially end uh may you know I'm looking at this Christian make Python great yeah make Python great again I think that's how you end every it's written in Python yeah which is awesome it's literally just parttime I use you just have to end the script with that I'm trying to find something on it oh that's so interesting is it just literally Python yeah there you go oh I think let's do the second I think we let's go with the Virg one second one no not that I think there's another one by the verge there let's click on that the Donald Trump programming language is not for dummies or losers love the headline main coding nice tagline okay so there's a part where it goes it goes like for example if you use a word that's been banned the error message will read we're all have to scroll down a little bit there yeah it's like that like whole section with the error message will read Trump doesn't want to hear it or if you use a word that's not common it will say we have a country where it is similar you have to speak there's some more features of Trump scripts so for example no floatingpoint numbers only integers because America thank you yeah so the idea behind not having any floating numbers and only integers is because America never does anything halfway all numbers must be strictly greater than 1 million the small stuff is in constant and there are no important code has to be homegrown and americanmade and in its raw form Trump's crit is not compatible with windows because isn't the guy isn't the type of guy to believe in PC yeah so if you sorry just one more time if we sell just a little bit down you'll have the first working Trump script so save roses are red say violets are blue if lies say if I can beat Hillary says so can you what and then you gotta end it with America's great so this is Trump dot txt Wow this guy even wrote this for us on github Wow now I'm actually gonna go to their Trump probably paid to develop this language you know you know when it came out I was gonna make a video on it right when it came out why didn't it come out by the way they know a few years ago because running it says features error messages are mostly quotes directly taken from Trump himself only the most say only the most popular English words Trump's favorite words and current politician names can be used as variable names the other one is like said if the running computer is from China Donald Trump's curb will not compile are you serious dude somebody went really far with this like it probably checks for IP addresses you know instead of true and false we have the keywords fact and lie won't run in rube mode because America doesn't need your help being great trump is all we need oh my gosh is the only key value pair Trump and Putin interesting I'm curious like why why why people like what inspires people to come up with this kind of stuff you know exactly I mean it's Trump somebody was probably emotional by constructing a wall aka by providing the wall flag so in terminal I think you can pass a flag when you're writing a command in a command line you get past a wall flag if you do that it says Trump's script will refuse to run on machines with Mexican locales man the Mexican developers star probably yes if you if you run like Python example dot py and then before you hit enter you you do hi you passed a wall flag it will it will if it's a Mexican machine yes so what is the point of this language is it like can you actually build stuff with it usually just I'm sure you can yeah you just you just try it as long as you're not on the windows and it makes a call in Mexico or China or China I'll be tough all right well we should move on to the next one I think we're coming up with an hour soon I'm not sure well okay all right we'll probably got to move faster than yeah and it's easy to type with small hands that's another feature I just saw that okay so language let's move on to number two worse programming language whitespace all right so what's crazy about this whitespace programming language if we pull up whitespace syntax I'll pull it up to right space sounds like a horror movie it's it's made up of just whitespace there there's nothing so like it's showing you all that color but that just means that they're highlighting it how it actually looks like it's just blank there's no letters there no words nothing it's nothing yeah it's just tabs and spaces yeah the entire language so if you scroll down a little bit scroll down more more you're gonna see a document that has nothing on it scroll probably yeah that's actually what the language is doing you literally have to highlight what you wrote to see what you wrote correct Wow but even then you can't really see yeah borders weights do you have to count like how much white space like yeah why space tabs and new lines is how you write code in it not trying to be disrespectful or anything but with this work with like blind people or something because it's like are you gonna say black people that would yeah of course would work with blind people all they it would blind people it would work better than jobs with white person because you're clicking a time to them it's no different than Python or something they're already using drill to them they're already feeling it any feedback we can get on this anybody that's playing that it has a little bit of a reference experience with whitespace talk about a head scratcher man like talk about like you know how much oh my gosh trying to write something like this you're gonna be frustrated all the time really hard is if you get a git diff or after you do a git merge with somebody's code and if to update it that would be a nightmare because when you're showing when they're showing the git diff they also have highlight the white spaces it's like oh man this guy just added all this new colors I'm like oh forget it approved yeah when you push it it's like oh man it sounds like a nightmare but one cool thing I just read on the Wikipedia page is um it's pretty much like the opposite of all other programming languages because you know most programming languages it ignores all the white space curve this one ignores any nonwhite space yeah therefore you can actually write programs in a normal program link oh it's white space embedded in Python so this way this would be great for hackers but yeah they can do is they can write look like nonmiddle moon not a little nonmalicious looking code in Python or something it's like printer script but it's actually white yeah using so it only entered the compiler only laser would know would need to know how to run white space right OS X would need to not hurt anybody it's a good program thanks for the in for like the secret code or something right it's like a it's like a little like Morse code as a programming yeah I was like what are they the CIA uses it or something you know I doubt it they're probably not smart enough to use it okay probably because we're a long time let's move on to the number one worst programming language on the planet this will hurt your brain make you cry make you weep it's called what is it called the brain [ __ ] literally yeah that is B are AI n f uck that's correct rain fallin word brain fog programming language I think the intention of the programming language is in the word you know yep and the idea of this programming language to be as esoteric ask complex as um as complicated as possible yep brain fog look at that code that was designed to hurt yeah one of the most frustrating programming languages was built that way on purpose but for a whole idea on yeah so it looks like really painful code that's a great article I think if you scroll down on that one it shows like how some of the code looks 2 by E so lingers is this like a thing it was create a 93 thousand by Swiss physics student named urban Mueller Mueller Mueller hmm I mean it was it was an attempt to create a language with the smallest possible compiler so it was actually like something making the code is hard for humans right but easy as easy as possible for computer like most efficient compiler but it's tearin complete so it actually it can actually write real code and do real stuff can we actually see some syntax that'd be interesting maybe maybe this article does not have syntax right there I imagined it right there oh my gosh so to write hello world this is was how you write it would look like so just listening to this go ahead confused imagine making your Python Django apps with that big so like if it's for anybody who's just listening you would normally write print hello world but in brain [ __ ] you would write like plus plus plus plus bracket greater in the side and period and the crazy stuff what is this so laters another programming language called or rant or Angleton words or anger ten words and it's a spin so brain [ __ ] is a spin off of that language and in that language every character is just the word that's every single word is like that curse how how here's another programming let's call chef which is pretty awesome and everything has to be written like a recipe oh yeah have you seen it yeah yeah I think you went over that yeah everything is run like a recipe and then that's not for oops to like put two tablespoons and then like repeat it yeah everything's related to like cooking looks like a Gordon Ramsay Channel everything yeah but yeah for this language it's just designed to hurt your brain as much as possible and I don't have somebody's ever made programs with this like it's a very low lingual low leg low low level language yeah where you know you're doing with pointers a lot you know you adding your pointer you're in committing porn decreasing your pointer you to check this out okay brain [ __ ] is the ungodly creation of urban Muller whose goal was apparently to create a Turing complete language for which he could write the smallest compiler ever for the Amiga OS 2.0 Amiga ran in Spanish right with a non non cultural people yeah writing compilers sucks you've written a compiler yeah yeah yeah so there you guys have it the top five worst programming languages to learn in 2020 and beyond probably I mean I don't know how far beyond maybe brain [ __ ] the look on the number one most programmers but I am willing to say on record that it won't no probably still be awful and that's it I hope you guys enjoyed the show learn more popular languages like Python or JavaScript or Java or something that's really relevant let us know what programming language was the worst to you so we can create something with it yeah we'll spin we'll spend 24 hours all learning that language and then develop something we'll go to his loft just let's not do brave [ __ ] that like that I feel like that's gonna be a really hard one yeah let's not do that let's do something that'll be like entertaining for them to watch to some script yeah that's better all right guys thank you so much for watching and listening to this subscribe to the channel if you haven't already
