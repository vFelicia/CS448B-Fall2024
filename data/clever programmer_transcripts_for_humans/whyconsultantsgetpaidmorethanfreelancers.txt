00:00 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:02 - disc Ozzie from clever programmer calm
00:04 - and today I wanted to answer your
00:07 - question of what's the difference
00:10 - between a freelancer versus a consultant
00:13 - so without any further ado let's jump
00:15 - right into it
00:17 - [Music]
00:26 - [Applause]
00:28 - okay so this question I've been getting
00:31 - a lot because I talk about it almost
00:32 - interchangeably and I say freelancer
00:35 - software consultant or software
00:37 - freelancer
00:38 - so I want to answer this question for
00:40 - you guys whether you're a programmer or
00:42 - in any field this is out pretty similar
00:45 - okay so this is not going to be so
00:47 - programming specific because I think it
00:49 - applies to pretty much any field and you
00:51 - can take it away right after watching
00:53 - this video so a freelancer is somebody
00:57 - who doesn't really work for one company
00:59 - as an employee a full-time employee they
01:02 - can generally choose their own hours
01:03 - choose to work with their own clients
01:06 - and a consultant is you know pretty
01:09 - similar in that case they choose to work
01:11 - on their own time to pick their own
01:13 - clients but here is one key difference
01:15 - that I think is there between a
01:18 - freelancer and a consultant so
01:22 - freelancer you know you're just trying
01:25 - to get as many people to work with you
01:27 - as possible trying to accept as many
01:30 - jobs as possible whereas for as a
01:34 - software consultant you're not thinking
01:36 - of these people as your customers you're
01:38 - thinking of them as your clients so the
01:42 - difference between customers and clients
01:43 - is that a customer is somebody who buys
01:45 - from you whereas a client by definition
01:48 - is somebody who is under your protection
01:51 - and there's something I got from Jay
01:53 - Abraham and it's helped me make that
01:54 - connection so as a consultant you're
01:57 - thinking that of them as your clients
01:59 - not just like somebody who's giving you
02:01 - a temporary job or just like you're
02:03 - trying to make a few extra cash or make
02:05 - fifty hundred thousand dollars extra
02:07 - this month as a consultant you're
02:10 - choosing to work with this person
02:12 - because you respect them or this
02:15 - business and you want to basically
02:18 - safeguard them and protect them from
02:20 - anything even if they're not thinking
02:22 - about it so now let's make these
02:23 - examples just a little bit more tangible
02:25 - so as a freelancer maybe you get a job
02:30 - right as well as a web developer you can
02:31 - go on up were calm and try to apply for
02:34 - a job there and let's say that they give
02:36 - you some Python job to do which is okay
02:40 - make this simple web app for us so
02:42 - people can check out and buy things okay
02:44 - as a freelancer you're going to
02:47 - literally follow every single thing
02:50 - that's given to you but do nothing more
02:53 - outside of it so everything that's in
02:56 - the requirements like make a check out
02:58 - page make this make that and then that's
03:00 - it whereas as a consultant even though
03:03 - you're up taesan web development
03:06 - consultant
03:07 - you'll be like okay wait a minute I get
03:10 - that you're trying to sell something but
03:12 - before I start to work on it do you have
03:14 - an audience and if these people are like
03:16 - no I don't have an audience well you
03:18 - should be like okay if you don't have an
03:20 - audience who are you going to where are
03:22 - you going to sell this to it doesn't
03:24 - matter if you have the greatest product
03:26 - in the world or the greatest service in
03:27 - the world if you don't have an audience
03:30 - so or somebody there who's ready to buy
03:32 - what's the point of investing all this
03:34 - effort hiring me as a Python developer
03:37 - for you you know charging you X amount
03:39 - of dollars to make something for you
03:42 - when at the end of the day there's
03:44 - nobody that you can sell it to and at
03:46 - this point they might go okay this guy's
03:50 - thinking too much
03:50 - I just wanted to hire somebody who's
03:52 - like a dumb brute and just does things
03:54 - and they might fire you in that case
03:56 - that's not the type of person you wanted
03:58 - to work with anyways because you want
04:02 - them to respect you and actually give
04:05 - you you know a thoughtful answer and not
04:08 - just fire anybody that you know they
04:10 - don't like or they don't like a question
04:12 - from them you should be in a habit of
04:16 - challenging people and challenging pre
04:18 - you know these these assumptions on the
04:22 - other hand instead of firing you they
04:24 - might be like holy crap this guy doesn't
04:27 - just do this geiger curl doesn't just do
04:29 - the bare minimum out of work that we
04:32 - give him this person does everything and
04:35 - then Beyond and still is able to think
04:38 - so he's not just following directions
04:40 - he's somebody who's actually autonomous
04:43 - and can think for himself so that level
04:45 - of autonomy is what most people need or
04:49 - most businesses need that type of you
04:54 - just being able to think by yourself
04:57 - whereas and that can make the difference
04:59 - between a lot of some people like how do
05:01 - you become a $100 an hour freelancer and
05:05 - I have a video on that and I think that
05:07 - something that's misleading maybe in
05:10 - that video is that it should really be
05:13 - $100 an hour consultant because it's
05:15 - hard to pay a freelancer that much money
05:17 - because you're just a commodity you
05:19 - think like everybody else you're just
05:21 - offering the same service that everybody
05:23 - else is offering there's nothing more
05:25 - that you bring to the table but as a
05:26 - consultant you bring your brain with you
05:30 - and you bring some other skills and care
05:35 - and love for what you're doing
05:37 - other than oh let me just get this job
05:40 - done because the person who's working
05:42 - with you is thinking this person doesn't
05:45 - even care about his own job he's trying
05:48 - to do what's best for me so somebody who
05:51 - you're trying to do the best for and
05:52 - they feel that do you think they're
05:54 - gonna try to you and pay you less
05:56 - money or will they be thinking okay I
05:59 - can trust this person a hundred percent
06:01 - now the question is just whether I just
06:04 - want to pay them or not and most likely
06:06 - they're gonna be like okay I want to pay
06:08 - this person the price of he or she's
06:09 - asking because it takes out the thinking
06:12 - for me to deliver quality work and if
06:15 - something's not right they'll also watch
06:17 - my back and tell me even if it hurts
06:19 - them it has a consultants one of the
06:22 - biggest things even if it hurts you you
06:24 - have to make the decision that's best
06:27 - for your client because they are under
06:29 - your protection that's your difference
06:32 - between a freelancer and consultant
06:34 - that's why I always talk about software
06:36 - consultants the reason why I'll use a
06:38 - term like freelancer is because most
06:40 - people don't understand consultant and
06:43 - they do understand freelancers so
06:46 - consultant is similar except that you
06:48 - really care and put your neck out there
06:50 - for your clients that's when you can
06:52 - charge $100 $150 two hundred two hundred
06:55 - fifty dollars an hour or sometimes even
06:57 - thousands of dollars an hour but if
06:59 - you're just starting out focus on first
07:01 - getting to that $100 an hour all right
07:04 - guys that's it for this video thank you
07:06 - for watching as always I love your faces
07:08 - often I'll see you in the next video
07:15 - [Music]
