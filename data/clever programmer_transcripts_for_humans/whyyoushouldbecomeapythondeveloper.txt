00:00 - hey what's up you how's it going this is
00:03 - Kazi from clever programmer calm in this
00:06 - video I want to talk about why anybody
00:10 - why you why that dude on the street
00:13 - should become a Python developer so
00:17 - without any further ado let's jump right
00:19 - into it
00:21 - [Music]
00:30 - [Applause]
00:32 - alright so there are a lot of reasons
00:35 - why somebody should become a Python
00:37 - developer before we get to that let's
00:39 - also kind of drill down on what it is
00:41 - that you want right for example do you
00:46 - want a job where you're working full
00:47 - time do you want a job where you're
00:49 - working part-time as a freelancer
00:52 - independent contractor or consultant
00:56 - what is it that you want what is a
00:58 - lifestyle that you want right that's one
01:01 - of the important things to decide and
01:02 - what types of things do you like to do
01:06 - so for me I like to take ideas from my
01:12 - brain write whatever ideas whatever
01:14 - crazy stuff is going on in here
01:16 - I like to take it and turn it into
01:18 - reality something physical that people
01:21 - can use so what do I mean if I was good
01:25 - at art which I'm not then I get to build
01:27 - art and it's pretty cool but I don't
01:32 - it's hard for me to get thousands or
01:34 - millions of people to use that piece of
01:36 - art right
01:37 - but programming allows me to do that
01:39 - becoming a developer allows me to do
01:42 - that a programming language like Python
01:44 - allows me to do that it lets me take my
01:46 - creativity from my head turn into
01:49 - something real like an app and then
01:51 - people can actually use that app so you
01:54 - can use that so people can solve their
01:58 - problems whether it's a mobile app or a
02:01 - web app a website whatever right it's
02:06 - instantly scalable that's one of the
02:09 - main reasons I love to do what I do be a
02:12 - developer the reason why I'm specific
02:15 - with Python is because you guys know I
02:17 - love Python it's easy one of the most
02:19 - paid and one of the most growing it just
02:21 - overtook Java last year its 2017 if
02:26 - you're watching this in 2018 it might
02:28 - have changed stats but I know that
02:30 - Python is growing okay so if these are
02:34 - the things that you like to do right be
02:37 - creative come up with your own ideas
02:39 - build things and then have the world use
02:42 - them
02:43 - then dad is one very good reason to
02:46 - become a Python developer now the
02:48 - lifestyle you want right don't even
02:50 - think so much about payment yet money
02:52 - comes but what's more important is your
02:53 - time so you're gonna grow old I don't
02:57 - know if you're young or if you're old
02:59 - watching this but you're gonna retire at
03:01 - some point you want to do something in
03:03 - the meantime that's worth while and also
03:06 - pays you well with programming and
03:09 - Python it pays you well so that's one
03:11 - thing that's already taken care of right
03:13 - if you're a Python web developer
03:16 - somebody who's developing web apps web
03:18 - sites you get paid 80 to 90 thousand
03:21 - dollars on average and more you you can
03:23 - get paid up to 120 hundred thirty
03:25 - thousand dollars a year it's not unheard
03:27 - of it's common now why Python like
03:30 - what's so special about it the cool
03:32 - thing is that I mentioned this a lot so
03:34 - I feel like I'm saying this all the time
03:35 - but this might might be your first time
03:37 - hearing this so I'm gonna mention it
03:38 - places like Google was built off of
03:40 - Python okay YouTube was built off of
03:43 - Python Spotify is built off of Python
03:46 - Instagram is built off of Python Dropbox
03:50 - is built off of Python reddit is built
03:52 - off of Python so Python is not a joke
03:55 - it's a very powerful language that is
03:58 - one very important reason where if
04:01 - you're thinking about where to invest
04:02 - your time Python is a pretty good choice
04:05 - now there are other languages like
04:08 - JavaScript which are really good but one
04:11 - thing I like about about Python is that
04:13 - it can speak with JavaScript HTML CSS
04:16 - naturally if you're not a web developer
04:18 - right I want to make sure that I'm
04:19 - speaking in terms which makes sense and
04:22 - Python doesn't have to fight those other
04:24 - languages you can actually use
04:27 - JavaScript with Python with HTML with
04:31 - CSS all those other languages ok so easy
04:35 - something you can use with everything
04:37 - else something can get started off with
04:39 - fairly easily and something that you can
04:42 - build platforms that can handle hundreds
04:45 - of millions of people per month like
04:47 - Instagram or whatever right Dropbox read
04:49 - it so incredibly powerful now for the
04:54 - lifestyle that I mentioned earlier if
04:55 - you want to be
04:57 - a full-time developer you have plenty of
05:00 - choices you can go with you know any
05:02 - company now you're not limited to web
05:04 - development with Python by the way so I
05:07 - want to stay true to what this video is
05:09 - about which is why you should become a
05:10 - Python developer if you're more
05:12 - interested in things like data science
05:14 - you can do that with Python right people
05:16 - who work at NASA those types of things
05:19 - where you know you have data and what to
05:22 - make of it for example if you're working
05:24 - at Amazon and you want to build a
05:26 - recommendation system which suggests you
05:28 - know these are the products you should
05:30 - get you know just like how Amazon knows
05:32 - you more than you know your wife might
05:34 - know you it's like hey are you done with
05:36 - this would you like the next one or
05:37 - would you like this similar product you
05:39 - know like hell yeah how did you know him
05:40 - as the hunt and you go and like buy
05:42 - those things it's because there's you
05:45 - know there's data scientists who are
05:47 - building that stuff for you
05:48 - it's like machine learning you know it's
05:51 - like algorithms that they have there
05:52 - they can recommend to you things that
05:54 - you wouldn't even recommend yourself and
05:56 - you basically make these computers
05:59 - artificially intelligent computers that
06:02 - do these things for you that think
06:04 - essentially and python allows you to do
06:06 - that machine learning you know which is
06:09 - something that I've also mentioned which
06:10 - is you know have you ever seen those
06:12 - videos where the there are these cars
06:15 - that are not controlled by anything and
06:16 - then they'll like a run into a tree and
06:18 - then they'll like run into a tree a lot
06:20 - and then they'll learn to not run into
06:21 - that tree then they're automated and
06:24 - they can go as fast as you can think
06:26 - like 30 40 50 miles an hour let's small
06:28 - little cars and they don't crash into
06:31 - anything or the Google cars that just
06:33 - came out right where there there's no
06:37 - driver and they're being driven Tesla
06:39 - cars that are being driven and there's
06:40 - no driver this is machine learning this
06:43 - is something you can actually do it
06:44 - Python image detection digit character
06:49 - detection you know the same one when you
06:50 - for example go to deposit a cheque
06:53 - before you have to always go to the bank
06:55 - but imagine well not imagine now we can
06:59 - actually do this you can take a picture
07:01 - of a check and then it detects the edges
07:04 - of the cheque right it detects that you
07:07 - know your carpet or your table is not
07:09 - part of the cheque so first of all
07:10 - that's imaged
07:11 - and it's called edge detection in
07:14 - another machine learning thing that's
07:17 - happening there is that if you wrote 500
07:19 - dollars in the check or $10,000 in the
07:21 - check it also detects that you wrote ten
07:23 - thousand dollars or five thousand
07:25 - dollars that's digit recognition or
07:28 - character recognition that's also part
07:30 - of the whole machine learning and data
07:31 - science thing so that is a whole another
07:34 - route you can go which is amazing and
07:36 - you can combine that with web
07:38 - development I'm a fan of web development
07:40 - because you get instant results you can
07:42 - instantly put together something for
07:43 - your friends or family or start
07:46 - freelancing for clients and then you
07:49 - know kind of nudge your way into the
07:51 - data science field from there because
07:53 - data science field is a little bit more
07:54 - traditional takes you a little bit
07:56 - longer to get a job it you know a lot of
07:59 - the times also has prerequisites like
08:01 - your degree or your level of experience
08:04 - whereas web development doesn't really
08:06 - have a requirement for degrees like not
08:09 - at all it doesn't matter if you have a
08:10 - degree or not it just matters if you
08:12 - have a little bit of experience mostly
08:14 - it matters about your skills and it's
08:16 - easy enough to build a portfolio it's so
08:18 - easy you can even like look online find
08:20 - some apps put those together one or two
08:22 - simple ones and you can actually start
08:24 - getting clients from online platforms or
08:27 - find clients locally okay it just comes
08:31 - down to reaching out so the reason why I
08:35 - mentioned web development is because
08:36 - it's easier thing to get into but there
08:40 - is a ton you could do with Python right
08:42 - anywhere from starting to working at a
08:45 - NASA or Amazon or Netflix level right
08:48 - Netflix also has a recommendation system
08:50 - built into it which recommends movies
08:52 - intelligently to you so with knowing
08:54 - what how many things there are with
08:57 - Python what kind of feels you can go
08:59 - into what kind of companies were using
09:01 - and how much money you can make it comes
09:03 - down to between also you know
09:05 - freelancing or full-time I like the idea
09:10 - of freelancing because it's easier to
09:13 - get into it and you get to choose your
09:15 - own hours and you're not stuck to this
09:18 - nine-to-five time that's one of my
09:21 - biggest things I love about being able
09:22 - to freelance another thing I love about
09:24 - it is you start
09:25 - of yourself as a business rather than
09:27 - employee because you have all these
09:29 - clients so now the clients are working
09:31 - with you they respect you as much as you
09:32 - respect them
09:33 - whereas in business it's a higher art
09:36 - yeah when your employees a hierarchy
09:38 - right and your bottom of the food chain
09:40 - or there's always somebody above you
09:42 - freelancing your clients you're their
09:45 - boss and they're your boss it's like
09:47 - equal relationship so the respect is
09:51 - great you can fire your own clients if
09:54 - you don't like them so you don't have to
09:56 - work with people who make you miserable
09:58 - and want to kill yourself every single
09:59 - day you don't have to do the work that
10:01 - kills you there's no like contracts
10:03 - there also you can do the stuff that you
10:06 - really like the stuff that you really
10:08 - love and get paid working with the
10:10 - people that you really enjoy and on your
10:12 - own time your own schedule so if you
10:14 - want to travel the world you want to
10:16 - travel see your family not be restricted
10:18 - to a specific time I know I've missed
10:20 - you know lots of special occasions
10:23 - because I was actually like I had a job
10:25 - where I didn't have time so freelancing
10:27 - kind of makes that a little bit easier
10:29 - but there are multiple routes you could
10:32 - go with Python if this is something that
10:34 - interests you going the freelancing
10:36 - route or going the web development route
10:39 - I'm gonna put a link here also I have a
10:43 - course that comes up around well if
10:46 - you're watching this in 2017 then I have
10:50 - a course coming up in November but if
10:51 - you're watching this some time later
10:53 - same course will be launching some other
10:55 - time I only open it for a short period
10:57 - of time but this course is mostly about
10:59 - Python web development and freelancing
11:03 - if you're if you're interested in this
11:06 - and you want to know click this link go
11:09 - to this page it's gonna be a page that's
11:12 - gonna tell you about this upcoming
11:13 - course and if you sign up which is free
11:16 - to sign up you'll be the first one who
11:18 - gets notified and then also give you you
11:21 - know the resources that help me become a
11:23 - software developer in less than three
11:24 - months and all the resources I give you
11:27 - in this or free as well
11:28 - so you're gonna get bonus and you're
11:31 - gonna be the first one to get notified
11:32 - when this course opens up if you're not
11:35 - interested in web development that's
11:37 - totally fine some things I
11:38 - mentioned to you if you want to go the
11:40 - route of data science or you want to go
11:43 - your own route you know there are plenty
11:44 - of resources out there for you like on
11:47 - Udacity Coursera udemy those resources
11:51 - have stuff about data science you know
11:54 - some basics about web development the
11:57 - only thing I did with my thing is put
11:59 - together not only learning with Python
12:01 - but also how you can start getting paid
12:04 - as fast as possible because I get it
12:06 - right most of you are busy and you have
12:08 - only a few hours a day whereas a lot of
12:11 - people and a lot of people online
12:12 - people's courses assume you have all the
12:14 - time in the world and in you can just
12:16 - spend all this time to like learn just
12:18 - learn about Python right and I like to
12:21 - say that learning and understanding plus
12:22 - $2 can almost get you a Starbucks which
12:26 - is actually something Tony Robbins says
12:27 - so I want to make sure that I don't only
12:30 - get you to learn but to earn at the same
12:33 - time or earn faster in a shorter period
12:37 - of time or you're only having to spend
12:39 - one to two hours building practical
12:41 - things learning practical things
12:43 - interested in that click this link go to
12:47 - this thing otherwise I gave you as much
12:50 - information as I could about you know
12:53 - give you a big picture perspective about
12:55 - Python hope you like this video if you
12:57 - like this video give it a little thumbs
12:58 - up if you hate it dislike it comment
13:01 - below tell me I'm ugly if you loved it
13:04 - comment below tell me you love me
13:06 - subscribe to the channel hit the bell
13:08 - button as always I love your faces off
13:10 - thank you so much for watching this and
13:12 - I'll see you in the next video
13:15 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up you how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk about why anybody why you why that dude on the street should become a Python developer so without any further ado let's jump right into it alright so there are a lot of reasons why somebody should become a Python developer before we get to that let's also kind of drill down on what it is that you want right for example do you want a job where you're working full time do you want a job where you're working parttime as a freelancer independent contractor or consultant what is it that you want what is a lifestyle that you want right that's one of the important things to decide and what types of things do you like to do so for me I like to take ideas from my brain write whatever ideas whatever crazy stuff is going on in here I like to take it and turn it into reality something physical that people can use so what do I mean if I was good at art which I'm not then I get to build art and it's pretty cool but I don't it's hard for me to get thousands or millions of people to use that piece of art right but programming allows me to do that becoming a developer allows me to do that a programming language like Python allows me to do that it lets me take my creativity from my head turn into something real like an app and then people can actually use that app so you can use that so people can solve their problems whether it's a mobile app or a web app a website whatever right it's instantly scalable that's one of the main reasons I love to do what I do be a developer the reason why I'm specific with Python is because you guys know I love Python it's easy one of the most paid and one of the most growing it just overtook Java last year its 2017 if you're watching this in 2018 it might have changed stats but I know that Python is growing okay so if these are the things that you like to do right be creative come up with your own ideas build things and then have the world use them then dad is one very good reason to become a Python developer now the lifestyle you want right don't even think so much about payment yet money comes but what's more important is your time so you're gonna grow old I don't know if you're young or if you're old watching this but you're gonna retire at some point you want to do something in the meantime that's worth while and also pays you well with programming and Python it pays you well so that's one thing that's already taken care of right if you're a Python web developer somebody who's developing web apps web sites you get paid 80 to 90 thousand dollars on average and more you you can get paid up to 120 hundred thirty thousand dollars a year it's not unheard of it's common now why Python like what's so special about it the cool thing is that I mentioned this a lot so I feel like I'm saying this all the time but this might might be your first time hearing this so I'm gonna mention it places like Google was built off of Python okay YouTube was built off of Python Spotify is built off of Python Instagram is built off of Python Dropbox is built off of Python reddit is built off of Python so Python is not a joke it's a very powerful language that is one very important reason where if you're thinking about where to invest your time Python is a pretty good choice now there are other languages like JavaScript which are really good but one thing I like about about Python is that it can speak with JavaScript HTML CSS naturally if you're not a web developer right I want to make sure that I'm speaking in terms which makes sense and Python doesn't have to fight those other languages you can actually use JavaScript with Python with HTML with CSS all those other languages ok so easy something you can use with everything else something can get started off with fairly easily and something that you can build platforms that can handle hundreds of millions of people per month like Instagram or whatever right Dropbox read it so incredibly powerful now for the lifestyle that I mentioned earlier if you want to be a fulltime developer you have plenty of choices you can go with you know any company now you're not limited to web development with Python by the way so I want to stay true to what this video is about which is why you should become a Python developer if you're more interested in things like data science you can do that with Python right people who work at NASA those types of things where you know you have data and what to make of it for example if you're working at Amazon and you want to

are busy and you have only a few hours a day whereas a lot of people and a lot of people online people's courses assume you have all the time in the world and in you can just spend all this time to like learn just learn about Python right and I like to say that learning and understanding plus $2 can almost get you a Starbucks which is actually something Tony Robbins says so I want to make sure that I don't only get you to learn but to earn at the same time or earn faster in a shorter period of time or you're only having to spend one to two hours building practical things learning practical things interested in that click this link go to this thing otherwise I gave you as much information as I could about you know give you a big picture perspective about Python hope you like this video
