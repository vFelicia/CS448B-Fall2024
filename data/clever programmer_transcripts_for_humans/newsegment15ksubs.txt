00:22 - much time being spent on improving the
00:25 - quality of the videos and doing a lot of
00:27 - work on the editing but then one thing
00:30 - that I realized was if I try to do that
00:34 - then what happens is I can't make a
00:36 - video for you guys every day but every
00:39 - day you guys have really important
00:41 - questions that you're asking me and so I
00:44 - can't answer them if I keep up at that
00:48 - level so i think that i decided to work
00:52 - in a compromise where I do try to work
00:55 - on some videos and make them really good
00:57 - but then I also want to kind of have
00:59 - this heart-to-heart with you guys so I'm
01:01 - sorry these videos might not some of
01:02 - these videos might not have like editing
01:05 - maybe won't have music but I just want
01:08 - to make sure that in these videos I
01:10 - could provide you value answer your
01:12 - questions another interesting thing that
01:14 - I wanted to start and I need your guy's
01:18 - help to do that is a question segment
01:21 - okay so like a question and answer I
01:24 - want to get your questions and give you
01:26 - immediate answers to them so we have a
01:29 - few two choices that I was thinking
01:31 - about so we can either have the segment
01:34 - called ask kazi so if you think it
01:38 - should be called ask kazi comment below
01:40 - say something like ask cause II and the
01:42 - second option is called Q and Q which is
01:46 - questions for kazi so if you think it
01:49 - should be questions for cause your Q and
