00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kanji from
00:02 - clever programmer calm how do you make
00:05 - money in weird ways how do you hire
00:08 - somebody to run errands for you the
00:11 - entire month let's talk about it so this
00:26 - is a question that kind of nobody asked
00:28 - me but I want to answer it anyways
00:29 - because I think that everybody could use
00:31 - some help with this and you know and
00:34 - maybe even learn something I don't know
00:36 - so one of the things that has helped me
00:39 - so much in life is just being very
00:42 - flexible and always trying to dig deeper
00:45 - rather than say like like just I can't
00:49 - or use words like wish which I think I'm
00:52 - you know I talked about in one of the
00:54 - videos so you have to dig deeper than
00:57 - can't and I wish right like when it
01:02 - comes to can't words like can't you just
01:05 - stop right there I want to be able to do
01:07 - this but I can't you just stop right
01:08 - there you are unable to kind of dig and
01:10 - dive deeper into it and find a solution
01:13 - you just limit yourself so let me give
01:15 - you an example let's start with my first
01:19 - story of how I just few minutes before
01:22 - just hired somebody to run errands for
01:25 - me for the entire month
01:27 - wouldn't it be nice for you to be
01:29 - sitting at your job or your school and
01:32 - somebody gets you the food that you
01:35 - wanted from wherever either your home or
01:37 - they picked up food for you from a
01:39 - restaurant your favorite Thai fried rice
01:41 - I love Thai fried rice or you forgot
01:45 - your equipment somewhere or you forgot
01:47 - your laptop somewhere and now you have
01:49 - to drive back five out of ten hours
01:52 - thirty minutes but you can't cuz you're
01:54 - in the middle of something so you need
01:55 - it so I think this is something
01:57 - everybody can use help with somebody who
01:59 - can run groceries for you someone who
02:01 - can run errands for you whatever how did
02:05 - I go about doing it how did I hire
02:06 - somebody from one month okay so I found
02:11 - like I did a lot of research
02:13 - found a website that lets you hire
02:15 - people that run tasks for you this
02:18 - person's hourly rate for a task was 38
02:21 - dollars an hour which is a lot right
02:24 - that's that's a lot so how are you gonna
02:27 - afford this person for one whole entire
02:30 - month that's not the question I let
02:34 - myself like that's the question I asked
02:37 - how I didn't go that's way too much and
02:40 - just stop looking a lot of you would
02:42 - stop looking right there and even me a
02:44 - few weeks ago or maybe a few months ago
02:46 - would stop looking right there but I
02:49 - stopped doing that so I was like okay no
02:51 - this is the person I want this is the
02:53 - person who looks like I can trust to
02:55 - have good reviews this is the person I
02:57 - want to run errands for me so I messaged
03:01 - them and I said hey you know how's it
03:03 - going blah blah um
03:05 - this is the errand I need to run can you
03:07 - do it he said yes I said give me a shoot
03:10 - and give me a call when do you have time
03:12 - he said I have some time in like two
03:14 - minutes I said okay I got I jumped on
03:16 - that call with him right it was a call
03:19 - started I said hello to him introduce
03:21 - myself I said I'm a crazy youtuber who
03:24 - does coding um apparently people love it
03:27 - so thank you you guys and he said oh you
03:34 - know wow like that's so random that
03:35 - there could be people who have followers
03:39 - for being a coder and we just kind of
03:41 - hit it off off had a good conversation
03:43 - and then I said hey look I'm looking for
03:47 - somebody who can do this not just for
03:50 - one time but over and over again because
03:52 - realistically I'm starving even right
03:54 - now I'm starving like I'm in my office
03:56 - and I'm making videos for you guys it's
03:59 - 7:00 p.m. and I haven't had food since
04:02 - like 9:00 a.m. and this is like this
04:05 - happens this has been happening so much
04:07 - recently because for me to get out of
04:10 - here and do something takes like two
04:11 - hours and then come back and in the
04:14 - meantime I can be making more content
04:16 - more videos more amazing stuff for you
04:18 - guys you know either writing you guys
04:20 - interesting emails that you want to open
04:23 - and read if you're on my email list buy
04:26 - a joint enclosure program
04:27 - or making videos for you guys or
04:28 - whatever it is right I have to keep
04:30 - busting out content like this can't stop
04:32 - so going to a place just to get food to
04:37 - cost me time high levels of productivity
04:39 - takes me a long time to get back into
04:42 - into the zone
04:43 - so what's my solution I got to hire
04:46 - somebody who can do it for me but why is
04:49 - there price is $40 an hour or 30
04:52 - something dollars an hour how do i
04:53 - afford them because if they're
04:55 - constantly doing this that's way too
04:57 - much that's very expensive I want this
05:00 - person to be able to do this seven times
05:02 - a week five to seven times a week like
05:05 - grab me food so that would cost I don't
05:09 - know what would that cost let's let's do
05:11 - the math let's say I want them to come
05:12 - run an errand one time I'm going to do
05:14 - the math right here on the computer 40
05:17 - times 7 times 4 that's like 1,000
05:22 - hundred and twenty dollars every month
05:24 - but that's ridiculous
05:26 - it's over $12,000 a year so that's odd
05:32 - crossed my mind because I can do
05:34 - calculations kind of fast but I'm like
05:36 - I'm not going to let that stop me so
05:38 - after I jumped on the call with him I
05:39 - said hey look this is not a realistic
05:42 - budget for me but before I continue on
05:47 - the budget here's what I would like to
05:49 - do I'm willing to be flexible because I
05:52 - know you're running errands for other
05:53 - people as well and so that would be
05:56 - helpful to you notice what I'm doing
05:58 - okay notice this this is very strategic
06:01 - because I'm trying to offer him
06:05 - something of value and I'm trying to
06:06 - speak from his perspective if I just say
06:08 - hey look it's when I gotta fit in with
06:09 - my budget I'm a student global he's
06:11 - gonna be like dude I don't want to work
06:12 - with you but he's not going to talk
06:15 - about anything after that he's just like
06:17 - I'm gonna do an hourly rate so I said
06:19 - hey look I am willing to be flexible you
06:22 - can come here anytime so let's say that
06:25 - you're running an errand for other
06:26 - people and you're swinging by O'Hare
06:28 - Airport you can come to the office you
06:31 - can come to my office and since there's
06:34 - no time restriction you really make it
06:36 - fit in with your schedule so it will
06:39 - almost be
06:40 - like really easy for you and he said Wow
06:43 - he goes that's great thank you so much I
06:44 - said also I am looking for somebody who
06:49 - can do this for an entire you know an
06:53 - entire month that would be awesome
06:55 - so I'm like is there a weekly or a
06:56 - monthly retainer that we could discuss
06:58 - that got his interest that got him
07:01 - talking in his light yeah that seems
07:04 - pretty interesting maybe we can think
07:05 - about that so I said okay and I said
07:10 - look I want this retainer to be seven
07:13 - times seven times a week like you know
07:17 - every single day but realistically man a
07:21 - lot of the times I'm not going to need
07:22 - it every single day like there are going
07:24 - to be weeks where you only come in once
07:26 - or twice so basically it's going to be
07:29 - like a little bit of extra cash for you
07:31 - once in a while but I would just like to
07:34 - have the security and have somebody that
07:36 - I could trust again that's very valuable
07:40 - for him because again I'm thinking from
07:42 - his perspective so he's thinking wow
07:44 - already he's such an easygoing client
07:47 - I'm he's helping me kind of have a
07:50 - monthly raid because usually when people
07:52 - have locked in a monthly rate it's
07:53 - really nice because he's thinking okay
07:55 - guaranteed my phone services paid off
07:57 - guaranteed my Netflix is paid off
07:59 - guaranteed my Hulu is paid off whatever
08:03 - already this is really nice for him then
08:06 - he's also thinking we could just client
08:07 - is thinking of my travel which he's made
08:10 - so easy so that objection is gone he's
08:12 - so flexible and oh look he might
08:16 - actually not even be calling me once in
08:18 - a while and I might just be actually
08:19 - making money without even going so
08:22 - there's already all these amazing
08:24 - bonuses that he's thinking about
08:27 - ultimately I said hey look I'm I can do
08:30 - this for one hundred and fifty dollars a
08:32 - month and what do you think about that
08:36 - you know is that something that sounds
08:38 - reasonable to you and if it doesn't you
08:39 - know let me know we can we can go week
08:42 - by week I can pay you I can pay you in
08:44 - advance and then you can take it from
08:46 - there and by the sound of it I have to
08:50 - still hear from him tomorrow's gonna be
08:52 - the first day is going to deliver
08:54 - you know and run an errand for me so for
08:59 - $150 a month I have a full-on personal
09:04 - assistant or an errand runner and that
09:08 - is very useful because I respect and
09:11 - value my time and my time is you know
09:13 - like what that one hour the two hours or
09:17 - one hour he would save me every day is
09:20 - massive because a lot of people just
09:24 - miss out like devalue their time and
09:27 - misjudge it because when you're not here
09:29 - when you're doing something else for two
09:31 - hours or one hour it's not like you're
09:32 - just doing that thing for one hour
09:34 - you're not thinking about how it's
09:37 - affecting your productivity one or two
09:38 - hours before that because let's say you
09:40 - have to do something at 2:00 when you're
09:42 - when it's 12:00 p.m. are you willing to
09:45 - really get into something that's massive
09:47 - when you know you have to do something
09:48 - like at 2:00 p.m. you're not you're just
09:50 - distracted by the side of something
09:52 - coming up so that thing that's happening
09:54 - at 2:00 p.m. is really affecting your
09:56 - productivity since 12:00 p.m. or 11:00
09:59 - a.m. and then after you come back now
10:03 - you're tired you got to get back in the
10:04 - zone it's going to take you a few hours
10:05 - again so even if you're doing something
10:08 - at 2:00 to 3:00 it's not just taking up
10:10 - one hour in terms of productivity it's
10:13 - taking like five hours of your time four
10:16 - to five hours of your time like it's
10:18 - massive at least for me it's massive I
10:21 - mean maybe some of you guys should come
10:22 - in and like shift gears like that I
10:24 - can't do that so there you go full-on
10:28 - person again I had to think outside of
10:31 - the box for this I you know this
10:34 - stiffness that we have nowadays in
10:36 - society like everybody I talked is
10:38 - you're so stiff and I feel like it's my
10:40 - service to say this to you guys because
10:43 - these things are helping me so much and
10:45 - I guarantee you everybody's going to
10:47 - laugh at you first when you do this like
10:48 - I'm just used to it now everybody it
10:51 - like when I tell this first time to
10:53 - anybody like friends they're gonna be
10:55 - like wow you're stupid you're paying
10:56 - this much I just went from having to pay
10:58 - $1200 $250 and the stuff that I could do
11:03 - in that time trust me is going to make
11:06 - way more than hundred fifty dollars even
11:08 - it didn't I would do it for my personal
11:10 - enjoyment because it just saves me so
11:13 - much time in pain so in terms of like
11:18 - restricting yourself and thinking in
11:20 - these you know boxes it's really
11:24 - important to get out of it because it
11:25 - can be devastating for you you know like
11:27 - money right another one of the questions
11:30 - that others I mentioned start of the
11:33 - video it's weird ways to make money
11:35 - look at how creative this guy is for
11:37 - making money for running errands
11:40 - somebody would just I told you guys
11:41 - somebody on the email was like I don't
11:43 - know if I can teach some beginner
11:44 - programming they don't want to pay me
11:46 - because I'm shy or whatever and I don't
11:48 - think they'll pay me these guys making
11:50 - money like $30 an hour of $40 an hour
11:55 - literally literally driving from point A
11:58 - to point B if you're 16 or 15 and you
12:03 - can't drive there's something wrong with
12:04 - you
12:04 - like it's the easiest thing right so for
12:08 - driving he's charging 40 dollars an hour
12:11 - another thing that I saw was like snow
12:14 - removal people are charging $60 an hour
12:16 - $50 an hour for snow removal so don't
12:19 - tell me that you can't find people to
12:21 - teach programming there's just so many
12:25 - ways to make money there's so many
12:26 - different ways I have been making money
12:29 - doing these things my whole lives like
12:31 - to me this is just natural like for
12:33 - everybody else when I talk to them like
12:35 - for me I get a lot of things and the
12:40 - academic world are like rocket science
12:42 - but you know and but for me like this
12:45 - stuff comes really naturally to me so I
12:48 - hope that this can help you like
12:49 - wherever whatever position you're in
12:51 - this is something helpful let's say
12:52 - you're a college student somebody runs
12:54 - errands for you and does all this for
12:56 - $150 a month you can use that time
12:59 - that's saving you to do private lessons
13:02 - to do somebody else's snow removal for a
13:04 - higher price to help somebody run
13:08 - errands like their groceries or whatever
13:10 - there's a website called TaskRabbit
13:13 - which allows you to actually charge for
13:17 - these services like there's just some
13:19 - bajillion ways to make money
13:21 - and programming is a really really
13:24 - massive one it just comes down to you
13:27 - actually hustling finding the people and
13:31 - making this happen and again for me the
13:33 - bigger things here are freedom and the
13:36 - willingness to say no and just
13:37 - willingness to not say no and always try
13:40 - to say yes in my head and it transcends
13:43 - above money and Present transcends about
13:46 - jobs or whatever else this is how I do
13:49 - things in real life I was scared
13:52 - shitless of skydiving and I didn't say I
13:55 - can't skydive I said ok to skydive what
14:00 - do I need to do so I would do small
14:02 - things that help me get over my fear and
14:04 - then I went and skydive skydive last
14:07 - year being in the dark and closing my
14:11 - eyes scared me so I went into a sensory
14:15 - deprivation chamber and then ended up
14:17 - surviving that for one hour and then
14:19 - that helped me get past so many of my
14:20 - fears so again it's not limited to just
14:23 - money or whatever guys the camera is
14:25 - dying I'm sorry I'm gonna have to cut
14:26 - this one short but there are different
14:28 - ways to make money different ways to
14:30 - think outside the box you can make
14:32 - partnerships as long as you stop saying
14:34 - can't wish just make it happen
14:36 - think I promise you guys can do more and
14:39 - college is not the only resource just
14:41 - one of the resources that's another way
14:43 - people restrict themselves like oh I'm
14:45 - just going to learn from here learn from
14:47 - multiple resources I'm not discouraging
14:49 - academic knowledge I am discouraging
14:51 - handicapping your own brain okay be
14:55 - entrepreneurial and everything in life
14:57 - it's not just about money it's about
14:58 - education money and the lifestyle okay
15:02 - you can be entrepreneurial in all
15:04 - different kinds of ways guys that's it
15:06 - I'm out this is Kazi I love you guys so
15:08 - much and I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up this is kanji from clever programmer calm how do you make money in weird ways how do you hire somebody to run errands for you the entire month let's talk about it so this is a question that kind of nobody asked me but I want to answer it anyways because I think that everybody could use some help with this and you know and maybe even learn something I don't know so one of the things that has helped me so much in life is just being very flexible and always trying to dig deeper rather than say like like just I can't or use words like wish which I think I'm you know I

you just stop right there you are unable to kind of dig and dive deeper into it and find a solution you just limit yourself so let me give you an example let's start with my first story of how I just few minutes before just hired somebody to run errands for me for the entire month wouldn't it be nice for you to be sitting at your job or your school and somebody gets you the food that you wanted from wherever either your home or they picked up food for you from a restaurant your favorite Thai fried rice I love Thai fried rice or you forgot your equipment somewhere or you forgot your laptop somewhere and now you have to drive back five out of ten hours thirty minutes but you can't cuz you're in the middle of something so you need it so I think this is something everybody can use help with somebody who can run groceries for you someone who can run errands for you whatever how did I go about doing it how did I hire somebody from one month okay so I found like I did a lot of research found a website that lets you hire people that run tasks for you this person's hourly rate for a task was 38 dollars an hour which is a lot right that's that's a lot so how are you gonna afford this

said hello to him introduce myself I said I'm a crazy youtuber who does coding um apparently people love it so thank you you guys and he said oh you know wow like that's so random that there could be people who have followers for being a coder and we just kind of hit it off off had a good conversation and then I said hey look I'm looking for somebody who can do this not just for one time but over and over again because realistically I'm starving even right now I'm starving like I'm in my office and I'm making videos for you guys it's 700 p.m. and I haven't had food since like 900 a.m. and this is like this happens this has been happening so much recently because for me to get out of here and do something takes like two hours and then come back and in the meantime I can be making more content more videos more amazing stuff for you guys you know either writing you guys interesting emails that you want to open and read if you're on my email list buy a joint enclosure program or making videos for you guys or whatever it is right I have to keep busting out content like this can't stop so going to a place just to get food to cost me time high levels of productivity takes me a

with your schedule so it will almost be like really easy for you and he said Wow he goes that's great thank you so much I said also I am looking for somebody who can do this for an entire you know an entire month that would be awesome so I'm like is there a weekly or a monthly retainer that we could discuss that got his interest that got him talking in his light yeah that seems pretty interesting maybe we can think about that so I said okay and I said look I want this retainer to be seven times seven times a week like you know every single day but realistically man a lot of the times I'm not going to need it every single day like there are going to be weeks where you only come in once or twice so basically it's going to be like a little bit of extra cash for you once in a while but I would just like to have the security and have somebody that I could trust again that's very valuable for him because again I'm thinking from his perspective so he's thinking wow already he's such an

so easy so that objection is gone he's so flexible and oh look he might actually not even be calling me once in a while and I might just be actually making money without even going so there's already all these amazing bonuses that he's thinking about ultimately I said hey look I'm I can do this for one hundred and fifty dollars a month and what do you think about that you know is that something that sounds reasonable to you and if it doesn't you know let me know we can we can go week by week I can pay you I can pay you in advance and then you can take it from there and by the sound of it I have to still hear from him tomorrow's gonna be the first day is going to deliver you know and run an errand for me so for $150 a month I have a fullon personal assistant or an errand runner and that is very useful because I respect and value my time and my time is you know like what that one hour the two hours or one hour he would save me every day is massive because a lot of people just miss out like devalue their time and misjudge it because when you're not here when you're doing something else for two hours or one hour it's not like you're just doing that thing for one hour you're not thinking about how it's affecting your productivity one or two hours before that because let's say you have to do something at 200 when you're when it's 1200 p.m. are you willing to really get into something that's massive when you know you have to do something like at 200 p.m. you're not you're just distracted by the side of something coming up so that thing that's happening at 200 p.m. is really affecting your productivity since 1200 p.m. or 1100 a.m. and then after you come back now you're tired you got to get back in the zone it's going to take you a few hours again so even if you're doing something at 200 to 300 it's not just taking up one hour in terms of productivity it's taking like five hours of your time four to five hours of your time like it's massive at least for me it's massive I mean maybe some of you guys should come in and like shift gears like that I can't do that so there you go fullon person again I had to think outside of the box for this I you know this stiffness that we have nowadays in society like everybody I talked is you're so stiff and I feel like it's my service to say this to you guys because these things are helping me so much and I guarantee you everybody's going to laugh at you first when you do this like I'm just used to it now everybody it like when I tell this first time to anybody like friends they're gonna be like wow you're stupid you're paying this much I just went from having to pay $1200 $250 and the stuff that I could do in that time trust me is going to make way more than hundred fifty dollars even it didn't I would do it for my personal enjoyment because it just saves me so much time in pain so in terms of like restricting yourself and thinking in these you know boxes it's really important to get out of it because it can be devastating for you you know like money right another one of the questions that others I mentioned start of the video it's weird ways to make money look at how creative this guy is for making money for running errands somebody would just I told you guys somebody on the email was like I don't know if I can teach some beginner programming they don't want to pay me because I'm shy or whatever and I don't think they'll pay me these guys making money like $30 an hour of $40 an hour literally literally driving from point A to point B if you're 16 or 15 and you can't drive there's something wrong with you like it's the easiest thing right so for driving he's charging 40 dollars an hour another thing that I saw was like snow removal people are charging $60 an hour $50 an hour for snow removal so don't tell me that you can't find people to teach programming there's just so many ways to make money there's so many different ways I have been making money doing these things my whole lives like to me this is just natural like for everybody else when I talk to them like for me I get a lot of things and the academic world are like rocket science but you know and but for me like this stuff comes really naturally to me so I hope that this can help you like wherever whatever position you're in this is something helpful let's say you're a college student somebody runs errands for you and does all this for $150 a month you can use that time that's saving you to do private lessons to do somebody else's snow removal for a higher price to help somebody run errands like their groceries or whatever there's a website called TaskRabbit which allows you to actually charge for these services like there's just some bajillion ways to make money and programming is a really really massive one it just comes down to you actually hustling finding the people and making this happen and again for me the bigger things here are freedom and the willingness to say no and just willingness to not say no and always try to say yes in my head and it transcends above money and Present transcends about jobs or whatever else this is how I do things in real life I was scared shitless of skydiving and I didn't say I can't skydive I said ok to skydive what do I need to do so I would do small things that help me get over my fear and then I went and skydive skydive last year being in the dark and closing my eyes scared me so I went into a sensory deprivation chamber and then ended up surviving that for one hour and then that helped me get past so many of my fears so again it's not limited to just money or whatever guys the camera is dying I'm sorry I'm gonna have to cut this one short but there are different ways to make money different ways to think outside the box you can make partnerships as long as you stop saying can't wish just make it happen think I promise you guys can do more and college is not the only resource just one of the resources that's another way people restrict themselves like oh I'm just going to learn from here learn from multiple resources I'm not discouraging academic knowledge I am discouraging handicapping your own brain okay be entrepreneurial and everything in life it's not just about money it's about education money and the lifestyle okay you can be entrepreneurial in all different kinds of ways guys that's it I'm out this is Kazi I love you guys so much and I'll see you in the next video
