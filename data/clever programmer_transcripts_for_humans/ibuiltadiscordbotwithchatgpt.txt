01:18 - to a new application okay just make sure
01:21 - you're on discord.com developer slash
01:24 - applications now I'm going to create a
01:26 - new application we'll call it chat GPT
01:28 - we're going to agree to the terms of
01:30 - services here now what we need from here
01:33 - is let's go ahead and go to oauth 2. I'm
01:36 - going to create a custom URL here we're
01:38 - going to call the discord.com API oauth2
01:41 - slash authorize question mark
01:43 - permissions and scope is going to be
01:46 - bought in the client ID we're just gonna
01:49 - copy paste the client ID from the top
01:51 - okay so client ID is right over here
01:56 - okay
01:56 - now we're gonna go and click add bot and
02:00 - we'll say yes do it let's go ahead and
02:02 - give it a photo so we're going to give
02:04 - it this little nice AI photo okay
02:06 - message content intent and let's go
02:10 - ahead and say let's go back to our oauth
02:12 - 2 custom URL let's copy it and let's go
02:15 - paste it and let's see what happens here
02:17 - boom it's saying an external application
02:19 - chat CPT wants access to your Discord so
02:22 - go ahead and say chat GPT add it to the
02:25 - server continue and then go ahead and
02:27 - authorize so it adds it to your Discord
02:29 - server now at this point it's authorized
02:31 - and it should be added to your Discord
02:34 - okay how you know is it saying it at the
02:37 - top right to add it to your Discord yeah
02:40 - now let's go to openai.com Let's click
02:43 - open and let's go to their API we're
02:46 - gonna go ahead and sign up or sign in
02:49 - you could continue with Google or just
02:51 - pop in your email and password go to
02:53 - view API keys and let's go ahead and
02:57 - create a new secret key so copy that
02:59 - secret key that you just created and
03:01 - when you go look at the usage you can
03:03 - see that you got a you got 18 dollars
03:06 - granted by them for free so once you get
03:09 - up to the 18 obviously you're gonna have
03:11 - to start paying but 18 you get for free
03:13 - okay so you should be good for up to
03:16 - that usage so let's go to API keys and
03:19 - let's go back to our replet let's go to
03:21 - secrets and let's paste in our key into
03:24 - secrets
03:25 - okay so open API key that's what we're
03:28 - going to call it and for the secret make
03:29 - sure to paste the secret that you had
03:31 - copied okay the SK at the start
03:33 - represents secret key all right and at
03:36 - the bottom it should be stored there so
03:38 - replit is also really good for handling
03:40 - and storing your secrets this is
03:42 - normally a pain and you have to add it
03:43 - to you get ignore and do all this crap
03:45 - if you add it to riplet you don't have
03:47 - to worry about any of that now we're
03:49 - going to add our Discord key and go back
03:51 - to your Discord developer applications
03:54 - go back to the bot and then go ahead and
03:56 - reset your Bots token and it's going to
03:58 - give you this token so copy that token
04:01 - and paste that in okay so now you got
04:04 - your API key and you got your Discord
04:06 - key now you need to have open AI org so
04:09 - go ahead click on settings and that's
04:12 - your organization ID so copy that and go
04:16 - ahead and add that in beautiful so now
04:18 - you should have Discord key open AI org
04:20 - and open API key those are the three
04:22 - that you should have here okay now in
04:25 - our our index we're going to add the my
04:27 - secret key so go ahead and add that in
04:31 - so process.nf automatically has access
04:34 - to all your environment variables so
04:36 - that's what we're doing right now we're
04:37 - adding all the keys and environment
04:38 - variables let's just change the variable
04:41 - names here so open API key will also
04:43 - have Discord key and then we'll also
04:46 - have open AI org so we got all of those
04:49 - all right now we're going to go ahead
04:51 - and create a client and a Gateway intent
04:54 - okay and now we're going to be actually
04:56 - setting up our Discord messages on our
04:58 - back end so this is we're already on
05:01 - step four so step four out of six are
05:04 - already completed so we're very close to
05:06 - getting this app up and running all
05:08 - right so for our intents we're going to
05:10 - go ahead and create an array of intents
05:13 - and in there we're going to have a
05:14 - Gateway intent for bits and gills we're
05:17 - going to get access to Guild messages
05:18 - okay let's also get message content and
05:22 - then on message create let's have the
05:25 - fall following happen so we're going to
05:27 - add a try catch block and then I'm going
05:28 - to try catch block I'm going to
05:30 - basically say hey if the messages author
05:32 - exists then return this will essentially
05:35 - prevent infinite Loops so this is an
05:38 - important one to add and then we'll just
05:39 - print out the message
05:41 - okay so print out the messages content
05:44 - next up what we're going to do is we're
05:46 - going to say for client login pass in
05:48 - the Discord key let's run this and let's
05:50 - see what happens okay so I'm going to go
05:52 - back to Discord let's see if anything is
05:55 - happening on the top right you can
05:56 - actually see Chad GPT is online right
05:59 - now which is a good sign testing let's
06:02 - try this let's go back and boom look at
06:05 - that we wrote testing in our Discord app
06:07 - and it just popped up right over here
06:11 - so that is a very good sign that thing
06:13 - that looks like things are working all
06:15 - right so now we're going to set up our
06:16 - open AP open AI okay so now we're
06:18 - already on step five of six so we're
06:20 - very close to finishing this thing let's
06:23 - require open Ai and then we're going to
06:25 - create a configuration for this okay and
06:28 - we're going to say for organization
06:29 - we're going to pass in our openai org
06:32 - we're going to pass in our open API key
06:34 - okay and let's go ahead and look at the
06:38 - example so at beta.openai.com examples
06:41 - you can see a ton of examples that
06:44 - people have already built and you could
06:46 - look at it okay so what we're gonna do
06:49 - is we're gonna go ahead and copy that
06:53 - text and we're gonna paste it right here
06:55 - okay there we go right now that we've
06:59 - got this now let's change the prompt so
07:02 - basically all we've added here is this
07:04 - part right here which says this right so
07:09 - you could even type it out manually if
07:11 - you want it to so for prompt we have
07:13 - message content and now we'll add in a
07:16 - message reply here and we're going to
07:19 - basically say hey from response get the
07:22 - initial Choice get the zero Choice and
07:25 - then grab the text from that so let's
07:27 - run this and let's go back to our
07:29 - Discord bot so I'm going to say give me
07:32 - five project ideas
07:34 - and let's see boom there we go so you
07:38 - can see that we're already at this point
07:40 - finished with the app so this is
07:43 - absolutely crazy we were able to build
07:45 - this app in about 40 lines of code and
07:49 - you had your very own chat GPT that you
07:52 - had built using Discord and you create
07:55 - your own bot and now if you can ask it
07:57 - things like hey give me five project
07:58 - ideas or you can ask it a couple of
08:00 - other things like you can ask it
08:02 - questions it'll answer them to you and
08:04 - at this point you should have your very
08:06 - own working bot I'm absolutely mind
08:09 - blown if you want to get access is to
08:11 - the app that we just built click the
08:14 - link below and I have the app completely
08:16 - made in reply it's completely free just
08:18 - go ahead and Fork it and once you're
08:20 - done forking all you need to do is add
08:22 - your own API keys so you need to add
08:24 - your open AI or key your openai key and
08:28 - you need to add your Discord key once
08:30 - you add those three keys you're
08:32 - effectively done I hope you enjoyed the
08:34 - video
