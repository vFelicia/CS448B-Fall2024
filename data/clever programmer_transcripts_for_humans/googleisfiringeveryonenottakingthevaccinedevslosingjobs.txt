With timestamps:

00:07 - google tells employees they'll lose pay
00:09 - and will eventually be fired if they
00:11 - don't low vaccination rules
00:14 - basically what google is saying is hey
00:16 - if you don't get the shot
00:18 - you're out and you're fired and this
00:21 - will cause havoc for so many developers
00:24 - and so many developers that have looked
00:26 - up to google and have loved google and
00:28 - now are gonna be uprooted simply because
00:31 - of a decision and a choice for their
00:33 - health that they're making themselves
00:36 - and if they don't do it then well too
00:38 - bad it doesn't matter you know if if
00:41 - you're working if you're a developer it
00:42 - doesn't matter how many years you've
00:44 - been working here sorry either you're
00:45 - gonna start having to uh get pay cuts or
00:49 - you're out and you're done with the
00:51 - company and you won't be working anymore
00:53 - as you would expect the employees fought
00:56 - back and the vaccine mandate has not
00:58 - been universally accepted by employees
01:00 - surprise surprise several hundred google
01:02 - co-workers have signed and circulated a
01:04 - manifesto opposing the company's
01:07 - requirements which leadership said would
01:08 - apply to all employees even those
01:11 - working from home who engage directly or
01:14 - indirectly with federal government
01:16 - contracts even working from home that's
01:19 - insane it's like imagine you're a
01:21 - developer and you're working from home
01:22 - and you're like hey i don't want to take
01:24 - the shot and they're like yep you're
01:25 - fired
01:28 - now the biden administration has
01:29 - actually ordered this with in companies
01:31 - with over 100 or more workers to ensure
01:34 - everybody's fully vaccinated and in
01:36 - response google has asked more than 150
01:39 - thousand employees to upload their
01:40 - vaccinations
01:41 - vaccination status to its internal
01:43 - systems by december third
01:45 - i'm just gonna jump in and add a couple
01:47 - of my own thoughts actually i was having
01:49 - a conversation about this with my
01:51 - girlfriend a few days ago and i was like
01:55 - i'm all for all types of things right
01:58 - but when it comes to this type of stuff
02:00 - it's like i get it they're both
02:02 - different sides to this but i think at
02:04 - the end of the day people should be
02:06 - allowed to come to their own decision
02:08 - and they should be able to make their
02:10 - own choice you know ultimately it's like
02:13 - i'm for the choice that each person
02:15 - makes because at the end of the day if
02:17 - there's a developer that's working here
02:19 - that does not want to put something in
02:20 - their body because they don't feel
02:22 - comfortable i think they should be
02:23 - allowed to do that
02:25 - i think it's people's choice
02:27 - and i think that's kind of where it
02:29 - makes it tricky right even if you look
02:31 - over here it says in section title
02:32 - represe respect the user this is in the
02:34 - manifesto and it says authors write that
02:37 - the mandate of barring unvaccinated
02:39 - googlers from the office publicly and
02:41 - possibly embarrassingly exposes a
02:43 - private choice as it would be difficult
02:46 - for the googler not to reveal why they
02:47 - cannot return
02:49 - so for example
02:50 - you know that is one of those things
02:52 - right they would have to reveal hey
02:54 - because i didn't get this shot i cannot
02:56 - return
02:57 - and that's a huge problem because this
02:59 - is your private
03:01 - health
03:02 - situation you know uh it would be like
03:05 - if
03:06 - everybody was supposed to just get a
03:07 - diabetes injection if you didn't get one
03:10 - you would not be allowed to come to work
03:12 - okay i get it this is different in this
03:14 - situation where you're actually going
03:16 - and you're kind of stopping a virus
03:18 - but still i feel like that choice should
03:20 - be left to the people and especially for
03:23 - people working from home if they're
03:24 - gonna work remotely like at least if
03:27 - they're just gonna work remotely let
03:29 - them work from home right and then the
03:31 - vaccination could not be required maybe
03:33 - you just can't come back to the office
03:34 - that could be one of the things
03:37 - so that's one of the things that's very
03:39 - tricky about the situation here's a
03:41 - point that i'd like to highlight the
03:43 - documents states
03:45 - it justifies the principle of division
03:47 - and unequal treatment of googlers based
03:49 - on their personal beliefs and decisions
03:51 - the implications are chilling
03:57 - this is something that should be very
03:58 - concerning for you and for a lot of
04:00 - people because i think it fundamentally
04:03 - starts digging deep into our human
04:06 - rights
04:06 - you know and our fundamental rights and
04:08 - i think it's some it's a conversation
04:10 - worth having and anytime a side just
04:12 - goes you are wrong screw you for even
04:15 - bringing this up and tries to shut you
04:17 - up i think that's a problem i think both
04:19 - sides need to be listened to i'm not
04:21 - completely against the side that says
04:22 - hey this should be enforced and i'm not
04:25 - completely against the side that's like
04:26 - it should be an open thing me i'm more
04:29 - like it should be your decision at the
04:31 - end of the day on how you actually
04:33 - proceed with this okay and at the very
04:35 - least if you're a developer and you're
04:37 - working from home hey let them work from
04:39 - home maybe they just don't need to come
04:41 - to the office okay so even if you were
04:43 - to do this and enforce it make it so
04:46 - they can't come to the office and if
04:47 - they work from home then they should be
04:48 - fine
04:49 - so
04:50 - those are just my thoughts you know it's
04:52 - a modern world and i think that we need
04:54 - to create rules and laws that are
04:56 - flexible that
04:58 - then you know work with the people right
05:01 - and actually support the people and give
05:04 - them a choice but you know i don't know
05:06 - i don't know maybe you think different
05:07 - right let me know in the comments below
05:08 - what you think how it should be
05:10 - but when i saw this this and i saw this
05:13 - since you know earlier today and
05:15 - yesterday
05:17 - this concerns me and so what i because
05:20 - what i believe is going to be happening
05:21 - is a lot of developers are going to be
05:22 - losing their jobs a ton of developers a
05:25 - lot of them who maybe are choosing to
05:28 - not
05:29 - do the vaccine right and a lot of them
05:31 - are going to be losing their jobs so
05:33 - here's what i want to do because this
05:35 - type of [ __ ] pisses me off and i want to
05:38 - have everybody get a fair opportunity
05:40 - regardless of whether to get a vaccine
05:42 - or not because you know what it's none
05:44 - of my [ __ ] business it's your
05:45 - business okay whatever you do is up to
05:48 - you so
05:50 - me on the other hand i'm vaccinated but
05:52 - i'm not against whatever decision
05:54 - somebody makes okay there's just like
05:56 - religious beliefs i feel the same way
05:58 - and with all types of beliefs i feel the
06:00 - same way so look if you're a developer
06:02 - and you're concerned
06:04 - and you're about to lose your job at any
06:06 - company for any reason here's what we're
06:08 - doing at clever programmer and here's

Cleaned transcript:

google tells employees they'll lose pay and will eventually be fired if they don't low vaccination rules basically what google is saying is hey if you don't get the shot you're out and you're fired and this will cause havoc for so many developers and so many developers that have looked up to google and have loved google and now are gonna be uprooted simply because of a decision and a choice for their health that they're making themselves and if they don't do it then well too bad it doesn't matter you know if if you're working if you're a developer it doesn't matter how many years you've been working here sorry either you're gonna start having to uh get pay cuts or you're out and you're done with the company and you won't be working anymore as you would expect the employees fought back and the vaccine mandate has not been universally accepted by employees surprise surprise several hundred google coworkers have signed and circulated a manifesto opposing the company's requirements which
