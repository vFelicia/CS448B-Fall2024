00:02 - how to make a hundred thousand dollars a
00:04 - year as a blockchain developer
00:07 - guys today is gonna be an amazing treat
00:10 - for you because you're gonna learn how
00:12 - to make a hundred thousand dollars a
00:13 - year as a blockchain developer and uh
00:15 - i brought on ivan who's the founder of
00:18 - morales to talk to you guys about it so
00:21 - ivan welcome brother welcome uh glad to
00:23 - have you here
00:26 - thanks man thanks man good to be here
00:28 - and by the way thanks a lot for inviting
00:29 - me because i know that your community is
00:30 - big you do so many great projects here
00:32 - on the channel and you have a very
00:34 - knowledgeable very respected community
00:35 - so good to be here thanks a lot
00:38 - absolutely
00:39 - man um this is awesome now we're
00:41 - actually live on youtube we weren't
00:43 - before
00:44 - yo what's up aaron we got guys today we
00:48 - are actually live so i'll be bringing up
00:50 - your questions or anything that you guys
00:52 - have along the way make sure to go ahead
00:55 - and mention that
00:56 - um and we'll bring them up
00:59 - but i think
01:00 - ivan a lot of people are seeing the
01:02 - crypto boom happening right so p some
01:04 - people are aping in and trying to invest
01:06 - their life savings but i feel like
01:08 - there's a much more guaranteed way to
01:10 - start making some income by doing
01:12 - something really useful and i and i feel
01:14 - like that has to do with being able to
01:16 - build on this platform and being able to
01:18 - use this technology of blockchain and to
01:20 - build on top of it
01:22 - you know
01:23 - what does that really mean how does
01:25 - somebody build on it and is there really
01:27 - opportunity here
01:30 - yeah that's a very good question and
01:32 - it's the correct place to start from
01:34 - because when you look at
01:35 - whoever is most successful in crypto is
01:37 - not the traders whether you look at
01:39 - vitalik or charles hoskinson or whoever
01:42 - that has done anything significant in
01:44 - the space they're builders they either
01:46 - build some kind of protocol or some kind
01:48 - of application or some kind of company
01:50 - so that's very important to realize that
01:51 - the biggest opportunity is building it
01:54 - is to create something in the space that
01:56 - that really makes an impact and it does
01:59 - the same thing with the insurance when
02:00 - the insurance was new you could trade
02:02 - some stocks yes it they they went up
02:04 - then they went down but the big
02:05 - opportunities f is everyone who actually
02:07 - started something a company a project so
02:10 - i totally agree that you have to build
02:12 - that's the best and most sure way to
02:14 - succeed in crypto in web three and when
02:16 - it comes to building you have to start
02:18 - off by understanding the tech tag and
02:20 - you have to start off by taking it very
02:22 - seriously and methodically and i have a
02:25 - whole video on youtube if you just
02:27 - google morales uh web3 techstack you
02:29 - will see i explain it for 15 minutes but
02:31 - on a big picture you can start even if
02:34 - you are a web developer if you're a web
02:35 - developer right now you can be a web 3
02:37 - developer
02:38 - because of course all web three
02:40 - applications need front ends and from
02:42 - there you can start using different
02:44 - tools like ethers like web3.js or like
02:47 - morales which we build in order to log
02:49 - in users authenticate get their
02:51 - transactions interact with smart
02:52 - contracts and so on and so forth uh but
02:54 - there are many many
02:56 - things we can go into we can speak about
02:58 - front-end space in web3 we can speak
03:00 - about smart contracts we can
03:02 - we can
03:03 - go into many different directions so
03:06 - it's up to you where you want to go guys
03:08 - absolutely yeah so i think i want to
03:10 - start off with like the opportunity
03:12 - right because for for the broader
03:14 - perspective
03:15 - most of the people aren't developers who
03:17 - are into the blockchain space yet or the
03:19 - web3 space i think for a lot of the
03:21 - viewers that might be watching right now
03:22 - i think
03:23 - you know they might even be like what
03:24 - the heck is this you know what's the
03:26 - opportunity here yeah and so i think i
03:28 - want to start off with is there an
03:30 - opportunity here does that exist you
03:32 - know how much are these developers
03:34 - making is that real and then i think
03:35 - once we kind of cover that i feel like
03:37 - let's then dig deeper into you know the
03:40 - technologies they can use and how we can
03:42 - use maybe even think tools like morales
03:44 - to make their lives a lot easier
03:47 - well of course there's opportunities you
03:48 - can look at the
03:50 - wage statistics the salary statistics
03:52 - and i think web 3 is among the top it's
03:55 - even above the ai space and and iot
03:58 - space and everything else that is very
04:00 - up and coming in tech web3 is above all
04:02 - of that when it comes to salary and
04:04 - becomes your opportunity so that's one
04:06 - way of looking at it and another way of
04:08 - looking at it is that this technology no
04:10 - matter which salary you get now this
04:12 - this technology is really the next
04:13 - iteration of the internet so the salary
04:15 - itself in my mind does not really matter
04:18 - because
04:18 - all technologies that that are going to
04:20 - be monumental it's worth working in them
04:22 - no matter what i mean you could imagine
04:24 - if you could work for free in in web 2
04:27 - in the 90s i mean just when these
04:29 - protocols were developing where you
04:31 - could like be one of the first
04:32 - developers to use ajax just to send some
04:34 - uh yeah yeah from your site i mean it
04:37 - doesn't matter what you get paid for you
04:39 - get to work with blazing edge technology
04:41 - so there is there is a lot of
04:42 - opportunity but i i personally i don't
04:44 - think a lot on
04:46 - on the actual
04:47 - salaries and wages because there are
04:49 - many things you can earn money it's more
04:51 - for a long term if you do this in 10 15
04:53 - years you're gonna be one of the top
04:55 - experts in the world and that's the best
04:57 - thing with web web 3 it is very early on
05:00 - and you can actually become best in the
05:01 - world right you can imagine becoming
05:03 - best in the world with something like
05:04 - web development it's impossible all
05:06 - right it's important
05:07 - you will not be best in the world
05:08 - there's too many people doing that but
05:10 - web3 it's so new nobody is doing that so
05:13 - that's the biggest opportunity that you
05:14 - can do something for a few years and you
05:16 - can really become top in the world at it
05:19 - right you can see this is build
05:20 - companies build projects whatever you
05:22 - want them
05:23 - i was just gonna say i've seen so many
05:24 - developers man when i was i was trying
05:26 - to hire a lot of blockchain developers
05:28 - to work on our team
05:29 - and like the the people with the most
05:32 - amount of experience was crazy it was
05:33 - like five months four months one year
05:37 - and even exactly exactly when i looked
05:39 - at the market i'm like yo those are the
05:40 - senior developers like those are the
05:43 - senior developers right now so i feel
05:45 - like that way the opportunity is huge i
05:47 - love your points about it being bleeding
05:49 - edge right it's something new that
05:51 - people can jump into and start learning
05:53 - and be ahead of the curve because it's
05:55 - the advantage that people had who jumped
05:57 - on the internet and started developing
05:59 - on it or the people that started jumping
06:00 - on new languages and technologies were
06:03 - like the developers that were doing
06:04 - pascal and cobalt and stuff like that
06:07 - started becoming you know legacy
06:09 - technology that very few companies
06:11 - started using in the future and so i
06:13 - think
06:14 - to your point it's really beneficial to
06:16 - stay with the curve and like keep moving
06:18 - forward
06:20 - exactly and let's also speak about what
06:22 - web3 is because many people they they
06:24 - throw out the words web3 but they don't
06:26 - really understand it so web3 is all
06:27 - about the different protocols that
06:30 - ensure that we can have decentralized
06:31 - applications where value
06:34 - is part of the internet where value
06:37 - transfers and really the value holding
06:39 - and value creation is part of the intro
06:41 - protocols what does it mean for example
06:43 - if you have ether you can send it to
06:45 - anyone you can program it it's
06:46 - programmable money so we can hold value
06:48 - we can transfer value back and forth and
06:50 - we can build on it as an open product
06:53 - call and that's the best thing for me
06:54 - about web3 because it ensures that you
06:57 - and i have ownership rights and property
06:59 - rights on the internet because without
07:01 - property rights on the internet we will
07:03 - all be living online very soon you know
07:06 - zuckerberg is investing in diverse a lot
07:08 - now his whole company is called meta a
07:10 - lot of big tech companies are investing
07:12 - in them in the matters also because the
07:14 - trend is that we will all be spending
07:15 - more and more time online maybe in vr ar
07:18 - who knows how the actual form form
07:20 - factor is going to be but the trend is
07:22 - clear we're heading towards basically 24
07:24 - 7 online experience that's if you look
07:27 - at the screen time how much time we're
07:28 - spending in a few generations it's going
07:30 - to be all online but look
07:32 - if that happens do you and i own
07:34 - something there can we own assets can i
07:36 - own some kind of real estate some kind
07:37 - of item or do i not own it or is it just
07:40 - an entry in the database that can be
07:41 - erased at any moment which happens all
07:43 - the time with the platforming as you as
07:45 - you know so it's a very important uh
07:47 - concept this this concept of web3 is key
07:50 - it's a protocol for value and ownership
07:52 - which is global which is neutral meaning
07:55 - that no company no government controls
07:57 - it and most important for us as
08:00 - developers we can build on it we can
08:01 - program money we can create our own
08:03 - assets we can build lending borrowings
08:05 - synthetic assets derivatives you can
08:07 - program it you can never pro program
08:09 - this before web 3. before web three you
08:12 - have to bake paypal maybe they give you
08:13 - access to their api and maybe they shut
08:15 - you off tomorrow and what can you do you
08:17 - can accept payment that's it can you
08:19 - program if you have an innovative idea
08:21 - can you program it dude i'll tell you
08:22 - once i'll tell you i'll tell i'll tell
08:24 - you one story right so like
08:26 - one of the times i was when i launched
08:28 - my business um
08:30 - i started making an income from uh you
08:33 - know i was accepting money through
08:34 - paypal
08:36 - and uh i don't know it was like 20 30
08:38 - 000 that paypal saw come in and you know
08:40 - keep in mind i went from like not having
08:42 - any transactions go through paypal
08:44 - through all of a sudden have 20 30 000
08:46 - comes through paypal flags it as a high
08:49 - risk
08:50 - potentially fraud type of thing
08:53 - and dude they locked up 20 or 30 grand
08:56 - from me for a year or two years
08:59 - you know and at that time that was
09:01 - everything for me when i was starting
09:02 - out and i was like this is this is
09:04 -  and i couldn't control and i
09:06 - couldn't do anything talk to me is that
09:08 - something somebody could do to me in
09:10 - like if i was you know doing this in the
09:12 - crypto world if i i don't know if i had
09:13 - ethereum those 20 30 000
09:15 - worth could could i be shut down or
09:17 - could they mark my stuff as as high risk
09:20 - and and keep me from getting my own
09:22 - funds
09:24 - so you can on a protocol level you can
09:26 - do whatever you want you you have your
09:28 - money you can transfer them it's
09:29 - cryptographic you have the private key
09:30 - for a wallet you can sign the
09:31 - transaction the network will accept it
09:33 - now of course if you have a bank or
09:35 - paypal for example they may ban your
09:38 - address if paypal adds a feature where
09:39 - you can cash out your crypto into
09:41 - dollars then they of course they might
09:42 - put restrictions but the whole point is
09:44 - that we can do transactions between each
09:46 - other without having the intermediaries
09:48 - without having paypal or banks in in the
09:50 - middle and that's only one use case for
09:52 - developers the best thing that has
09:54 - happened here is that we have the
09:56 - biggest sandbox development sandbox
09:58 - where you and i can build whatever you
09:59 - want issuing assets like i mentioned or
10:01 - programming money flows if i send so
10:04 - basically we can create more contracts
10:05 - smart contract is a program that can
10:07 - hold money and it can decide what to do
10:09 - with money based on our code and you
10:11 - program this smart contracts in solidity
10:13 - which is a programming language that you
10:14 - show very well on the clever programmer
10:16 - which is kind of like javascript it's so
10:18 - easy to start with and the we can
10:20 - program hey you send money to this
10:22 - program if this happens it will send it
10:24 - there if that happens if it will send it
10:26 - there that's maybe the the most simple
10:28 - program you can build if this then that
10:30 - or you can have something more complex
10:32 - that we can have a a an
10:34 - on-chain exchange like for example with
10:36 - uni swab where people can trade assets
10:38 - back and forth i have ethereum you have
10:41 - usdt tether or something else we can
10:43 - trade between each other without
10:44 - intermediaries that's maybe the most
10:46 - insane use case so it's kind of like so
10:49 - just to uh connect it for everybody it's
10:51 - like when you say unit swap it's kind of
10:53 - like being able to exchange on there
10:54 - it's almost like being able to exchange
10:57 - on robinhood without it being
10:59 - centralized in any way and nobody
11:00 - controlling it and you just get to make
11:02 - your own trades
11:05 - exactly and the best thing you can embed
11:06 - it in your app meaning let's say you
11:08 - have a game and you want people to earn
11:11 - some in-game currency or maybe they kill
11:12 - a monster they have some loot they have
11:14 - some gold now they can trade that gold
11:16 - for east i mean that's crazy without is
11:18 - there just a protocol you don't have to
11:20 - apply to some you know verification get
11:22 - some paypal accept no you just integrate
11:25 - uni swap use a protocol you list your
11:28 - coin there anyone can lose their coin
11:30 - and now you can have is in-game swapping
11:33 - and anyone can do it you can be 12 years
11:35 - old you know simple javascript you can
11:37 - do it it's insane and that's really what
11:39 - i love the best that what what web3 is
11:42 - doing to value and money is basically
11:44 - what iphone did to phones because iphone
11:46 - ensures that you can now program phones
11:48 - you can program phones with iphone
11:49 - before you had nokia they gave you three
11:52 - applications they gave you sms they gave
11:55 - you phone calls and then they gave you
11:56 - the snake game and that's it
11:58 - and that's basically that's basically
12:00 - what what we have before web 3. before
12:02 - we have like paypal you have stripe
12:05 - and that's it you don't have anything
12:06 - else now with web3 uni can build
12:08 - anything with one so it's really opening
12:10 - up this whole potential for a whole
12:12 - development ecosystem where the full
12:15 - talent and the full potential of
12:16 - humankind is unleashed you can be a
12:18 - developer you can be whichever developer
12:20 - you want you can program you can build
12:22 - you can innovate so yeah i love that
12:24 - that is really powerful i love that
12:26 - example you gave with an iphone and by
12:27 - the way guys if you're here watching
12:29 - this smash that like button let's get
12:30 - this video out to more and more people
12:33 - let's please start smashing it and um
12:36 - we have a question here for you can a
12:38 - database of a blockchain be shareable so
12:41 - i imagine this question basically means
12:43 - you know hey if i have mongodb i can
12:45 - share it with people i can have people
12:47 - jump in you know can can that be
12:49 - something that's shareable
12:52 - well the whole idea with blockchain is
12:53 - that it sure it's shared by default it's
12:55 - open by default so all the ethereum
12:57 - transactions are readable and accessible
12:59 - by everyone so that's what we mean that
13:01 - is global and it's neutral meaning that
13:03 - anyone can read it anyone can write to
13:05 - it anyone can access it and it's amazing
13:07 - for storing financial transactions it's
13:09 - amazing for storing balances and
13:11 - all of these different basic
13:13 - basic features of a blockchain but of
13:14 - course it's not meant to be used for
13:16 - everything let's say that i have a game
13:18 - with 60 frames per second i mean of
13:20 - course i cannot run it on the blockchain
13:22 - because the blockchain it's very slow
13:23 - database and it is basically a mixture
13:26 - so for example when you look at ethereum
13:28 - or polygon or binance chain or avalanche
13:30 - it's it's a mixture of a blockchain uh
13:33 - of a database where you can just store
13:34 - transactions but also of a virtual
13:36 - machine where you can also execute your
13:38 - own custom logic your own smart
13:40 - contracts based on what's happening on
13:42 - the blockchain and you can send and you
13:43 - can program money to behave differently
13:45 - depending on what's happening on the
13:47 - blockchain so it's it's both blockchain
13:49 - definition of blockchain by itself is
13:51 - that it is this decentralized open
13:53 - database but also with a virtual machine
13:56 - where you can uh script what uh what
13:59 - will happen with the different coins and
14:00 - tokens depending on what happens uh
14:03 - which transactions happen on the
14:04 - blockchain in this database basically
14:06 - yeah
14:07 - absolutely okay so the short answer is
14:09 - yes it is shareable and the longer
14:11 - answer has i love what you said which is
14:13 - it's shared by shareable by default
14:15 - that's the whole you know idea behind
14:18 - but it's not for all use cases i mean if
14:20 - i let's say i have a game
14:21 - world i make world of warcraft but web3
14:24 - i mean i cannot run it fully on chain it
14:26 - will not work because yeah we can only
14:28 - do seven transactions per second or so
14:29 - in e with layer two is faster but all
14:32 - the in-game in-game currency transfers
14:34 - and all of the monetary transfers that
14:36 - can be on chain the value transactions
14:38 - should be on chain and then everything
14:40 - else should be optioned because of
14:41 - course you cannot run the whole you know
14:43 - 3d
14:44 - 3d engine and all of that and all the
14:47 - game backend on chain it will not work
14:48 - but everything that has to do with asset
14:50 - with value with ownership transfers that
14:53 - can be unchained and that should be on
14:54 - chain yes got it um
14:57 - i'll giant has a comment that he he made
14:59 - that i think you'd appreciate and he
15:01 - says morales really made integration of
15:03 - web 3 and react really a piece of cake
15:06 - so kudos that's good nice work man
15:08 - that's good to hear um thank you just
15:10 - science guys just to provide some
15:12 - context guys morales is a software that
15:14 - you know ivan you've created right or
15:16 - you've worked with your team to create
15:18 - well like
15:18 - exactly exactly so i haven't created it
15:20 - but i'm one of the founders and we
15:23 - basically wanted to create an experience
15:24 - kind of like firebase
15:26 - kind of like super bass but in web 3
15:29 - because before morales you had to have a
15:31 - back-end team to even get started so for
15:33 - example when someone logs in with their
15:34 - wallet in your application if you don't
15:36 - use morales you need to create a
15:38 - back-end where you verify the signature
15:40 - then you have to figure out how to get
15:42 - all of their assets which means that you
15:43 - need to integrate some kind of api and
15:45 - build out and scale it let's say you
15:47 - want to you have a smart contract you
15:48 - need to figure out how to listen to
15:50 - whatever happens in that smart contract
15:51 - to the different events so with morales
15:53 - we thought why why isn't there a
15:55 - solution which is just uh you know you
15:57 - your web interface where you can say hey
16:00 - um here are all the smart contracts i'm
16:02 - interested in just sync them all in real
16:04 - time and put it in my database or here
16:06 - is one line of code for you to insert in
16:09 - your front's application so you can
16:10 - accept users so that they can
16:11 - authenticate and we create user profiles
16:14 - and sessions and all of that so we
16:16 - basically took the the biggest use case
16:18 - possible which is logging users syncing
16:20 - user at the transactions seeking smart
16:22 - contracts swinky smart contracts event
16:24 - and made it as easy as possible with
16:25 - morales and yeah since then we've been
16:27 - growing it and we have a whole plug-in
16:29 - ecosystem and things like that but the
16:31 - goal from the beginning was to create an
16:33 - experience that is familiar to all web 2
16:36 - developers that have used like firebase
16:37 - for super i love that they want to go
16:39 - into web 3 yeah i love that i love your
16:42 - guys's focus on developer first and like
16:44 - really caring about the developers
16:46 - because yeah like
16:47 - that is true that's what i was doing
16:48 - like whenever i would like start
16:50 - building an application with on on the
16:52 - blockchain i would like whip up a
16:53 - backend i would be like hey we need to
16:55 - lock these users and when i discover
16:57 - morales i'm like wait that can just all
16:58 - happen at the same time in the same
17:00 - place right um and you guys have a
17:02 - database which is super nice
17:04 - um here's a good question
17:06 - it took me a second to kind of
17:08 - understand it but now i understand it
17:09 - and i think it's pretty good mustafa
17:11 - asks
17:12 - are we super early to jump in web 3
17:16 - or is it time to learn and build web
17:18 - three so my translation of this is
17:21 - is are we like too early because
17:23 - everybody keeps saying early so he's
17:25 - saying is it like too early where there
17:27 - are not even that many opportunities
17:28 - there so maybe i should wait
17:31 - or is this the right time to actually
17:34 - start learning and building on web3 well
17:36 - of course it's the right time because
17:37 - what's your alternative are you gonna be
17:39 - a normal web developer look you're
17:41 - competing with 30 million you're
17:43 - competing with everyone in the world
17:45 - basically who is also a developer what
17:47 - what are you guys are going to uh you
17:49 - can go into ai and spend seven years
17:51 - learning the deep math of that and which
17:53 - is by the way fantastic but it's also
17:55 - it's overly hyped i remember in 2017 i
17:58 - when
18:00 - i was still doing masters in university
18:01 - machine learning was so hyped i mean uh
18:03 - all of the world's smartest engineers
18:06 - are already in machine learning so look
18:08 - what are you gonna do otherwise web
18:09 - stream i love it because because of the
18:11 - opportunity and because of the unfair
18:13 - advantage because we're still in a in a
18:16 - stage where the mothers don't tell their
18:18 - kids to go into blockchain right because
18:21 - this is when it's too late when you have
18:23 - the average mom telling hey you need to
18:24 - become a webster developer it's too late
18:26 - and guess what now all all mothers are
18:28 - telling their kids go become a doctor or
18:31 - become a developer okay but not a web 3
18:33 - developer so that's this is the perfect
18:36 - opportunity and i personally i love all
18:38 - industries where people have not been
18:40 - thinking too much uh what do i mean well
18:42 - look at web2 there are maybe you know
18:45 - thousands if you look took
18:47 - every if you spend any time thinking
18:49 - about ideas in web 2 or technologies in
18:51 - web 2 and you just add everyone who has
18:53 - been thinking about web 2 probably is
18:56 - thousands of years humankind have spent
18:58 - thousands and thousands and thousands of
19:00 - years thinking about web 2 if you just
19:02 - put everyone's thinking time after each
19:04 - other yeah and look if you're going to
19:06 - come into web 2 maybe you want to build
19:08 - some kind of thing with react or
19:10 - something some kind of ios app look it's
19:12 - too late
19:14 - whatever idea you had it's probably
19:16 - already discovered and it's tested and
19:18 - there is already a market dominance by
19:20 - someone and there is already a monopoly
19:22 - probably so uh is there is too late but
19:26 - web3 we haven't been thinking a lot
19:27 - there are so so much opportunity and so
19:29 - so much arbitrage basically that you can
19:32 - discover a problem and chances are it's
19:34 - not solved chances are you're one of the
19:36 - first people trying to solve it so i
19:38 - definitely think that it's not too early
19:40 - and the earlier the better because you
19:42 - have more time to establish yourself and
19:44 - it's all about your conviction do you do
19:46 - you think that web3 is needed if yes it
19:48 - cannot be too early if you still don't
19:50 - understand it uh slightly more study
19:52 - more re read
19:54 - read about what it can be and uh and be
19:57 - convinced that and when you're convinced
19:58 - then it's a no-brainer
20:00 - yeah absolutely um
20:02 - yeah i think for me it was it
20:05 - it took me a while to get convinced but
20:08 - i think what got me in initially were
20:10 - like the monkeys and
20:12 - um being able to make money very very
20:15 - quickly and then
20:17 - that's what got me in and then i got i
20:19 - lost a couple of trades i like got rug
20:22 - pulled
20:23 - and then i was like you know what i i
20:25 - really need to learn this and then i
20:27 - actually started enjoying it so i came
20:29 - for the memes but stayed for the test
20:32 - right
20:33 - right that's great and also you know
20:34 - many people they say oh and nfts are so
20:36 - dumb you know nfc's this dumb apes many
20:39 - people that that are more you know
20:42 - veteran crypto so to speak they they
20:44 - complain but i love nfcs because they
20:46 - get us so much adoption people really
20:48 - find them fantastic it's a community i
20:50 - see graffiti i think it was in new york
20:52 - city i saw a lot of graffiti with this
20:54 - board ape so it's i think it has they
20:57 - have given us a lot they've given us so
20:58 - many great people developers like
21:00 - yourself and it's been a good um a good
21:03 - push for many people to get into web3
21:05 - because before that we had d phi which
21:07 - is decentralized finance lending
21:09 - synthetic assets derivatives but that's
21:11 - too complex for the average joe it's too
21:13 - complex enough people don't know what
21:15 - derivatives are but people know what
21:17 - collectibles are what game assets are so
21:20 - nfc's it's a perfect segue and i think
21:21 - nfcs will give web3 worldwide mass
21:24 - adoption we're still not there but it
21:26 - seems to be the avenue for sure
21:28 - yeah i think um nfts as well as gaming i
21:32 - think
21:33 - i i feel like the future of gaming in in
21:35 - this space is going to be really really
21:37 - massive
21:38 - um i have yet to think about how they're
21:40 - going to integrate start integrating it
21:42 - later into like mainstream games but one
21:44 - of the games that comes to my mind is
21:45 - fifa like fifa would be the perfect
21:48 - because fifa has its own stock market
21:50 - with like five million active users i
21:52 - used to buy cards and see if i have
21:54 - messi or you know cristiano ronaldo or
21:56 - whoever else and i would unpack the
21:58 - cards all the time and then like my
22:00 - brother is always watching the fifa
22:02 - stock like which players values going up
22:04 - and down there's millions of trades
22:06 - going on in any given second and so i'm
22:08 - like
22:09 - i feel like
22:10 - if if the blockchain were to figure out
22:13 - its way into something like fifa
22:16 - you would have like a average kid making
22:19 - forty fifty thousand dollars six
22:21 - thousand dollars a year just playing
22:22 - games at home
22:25 - well that's one another one that i
22:27 - really like are these physical brands
22:29 - like nike for example that now have an
22:32 - opportunity to digitalize themselves for
22:34 - a fifa this may not be the perfect
22:36 - opportunity because they they are
22:38 - already digital they are all they have
22:40 - all of this transaction volume they're
22:42 - always digital but when you look at
22:43 - business opportunities i think for
22:45 - physical brands it's fantastic because
22:47 - imagine if nike
22:49 - they have a shoe and they create an nfc
22:51 - which can be redeemed for this special
22:53 - shoe and now people can trade this nfc
22:56 - between each other and speculate and
22:58 - maybe people will trade it a thousand
22:59 - times before someone actually redeems
23:01 - the shoe and nike can take a cut of all
23:04 - of the transactions and that's very nice
23:05 - business model for someone like a
23:07 - physical brand that wants to now become
23:09 - a digital
23:10 - digital
23:11 - brand and digital fashion so
23:14 - i think
23:15 - nike can 10x their revenue probably by
23:18 - doing some special
23:19 - digital edition they did
23:22 - yeah they launched their project and it
23:24 - sold out you know
23:25 - it was huge uh one of the projects that
23:27 - they heard them and adidas
23:29 - um zephyrine asks i have no professional
23:32 - working experience however i have worked
23:34 - on couple of hackathon projects on web3
23:37 - having trouble landing my first
23:39 - internship
23:40 - job suggestions
23:43 - well i have many suggestions
23:45 - you need to figure out which projects
23:47 - you want to work with and don't just
23:48 - send them the resume it's too many
23:50 - people send the resume
23:52 - all projects uh and by the way it also
23:54 - applies to morales to to our project or
23:56 - to anyone else they have a community
23:59 - because that's the most important thing
24:00 - in web street that you have a community
24:01 - maybe it's on discord on telegram
24:03 - somewhere else so if i were you i would
24:06 - start being active there let's say that
24:08 - it's some kind of
24:09 - of a product maybe a game or something
24:12 - you can start helping people out maybe
24:13 - there's some bugs you can start fixing
24:15 - them maybe there is some opportunity to
24:17 - contribute to their open source
24:19 - repository you can start doing that so
24:21 - instead of cv be active in the community
24:23 - of course you can also send the cv but
24:24 - there are just so many and cvs will be
24:26 - reviewed by the hr department and
24:29 - they're going to look at it differently
24:30 - compared to if you contribute to the
24:32 - open source repository and you're going
24:33 - to get noticed by a dev or you're going
24:35 - to do something in their community and
24:36 - you're going to get noticed maybe by one
24:38 - of the founders because founders look at
24:40 - the community a lot and you're going to
24:42 - have different people look at you so i i
24:44 - would recommend that be active in the
24:46 - community have a portfolio of course i
24:47 - mean that's a given you need to have a
24:48 - portfolio maybe github maybe something
24:50 - else of projects and if you want to
24:53 - practically build up your portfolio
24:56 - you can go to morales.projects
24:59 - and uh we do this weekly project it's
25:01 - kind of like you have here a clever
25:03 - programmer so you can of course
25:05 - subscribe of course to a clever
25:07 - programmer here you're doing also
25:08 - projects
25:09 - but do do that do that and then maybe
25:12 - adapt them maybe continue building you
25:14 - watch clever programmers then continue
25:16 - building something
25:17 - to put a twist to them or or if you are
25:19 - in various projects do the same so you
25:21 - have a good base and then you you can
25:23 - continue building or and and and making
25:25 - them your own and the
25:27 - step two would be to be active in the
25:28 - communities and i think you you will
25:30 - very quickly find a job this way because
25:32 - i know for myself we've taken a lot of
25:34 - people from our community that we hired
25:36 - and some of the our best hires have been
25:37 - from the community because they already
25:40 - love morality they are already engaged
25:42 - they're already basically working but in
25:44 - their free time so it just makes perfect
25:46 - sense that we start working for real and
25:48 - they become part of the team so
25:50 - community community community be active
25:51 - in the community guys that's the best
25:53 - the best thing and it does it doesn't
25:55 - work like that in web too let's say i
25:56 - want to work in google i mean there is
25:58 - no telegram to go to like okay i know
26:00 - you know i cannot be there in there some
26:01 - kind of discord chat but in web 3 it's
26:04 - all discord i mean and that's because
26:06 - it's so early you know we're still like
26:07 - in discord like figuring out things and
26:09 - maybe this was like uh irc chats in the
26:12 - past oh yeah i wasn't part of that but
26:15 - but we're still early on people ever
26:17 - they what whoever you want to meet in
26:19 - web 3 you you can you can meet them you
26:21 - can meet them in the chat group that's
26:23 - the best thing with web3
26:24 - yeah absolutely um we're getting really
26:27 - nice questions man there are a ton of
26:29 - questions i
26:30 - um one of the questions that just
26:32 - actually came in i want to address this
26:35 - actually is how long will it take me to
26:36 - learn blockchain tech from scratch so
26:39 - assuming somebody's a complete beginner
26:42 - and they're just about to start learning
26:44 - you know
26:46 - how long does it take for an average
26:48 - person who's maybe maybe a little bit of
26:50 - a developer has some developer
26:51 - experience but they want to learn
26:53 - blockchain how long would you save till
26:55 - they they understand it and use things
26:58 - with it
26:59 - i think it can be in a couple of months
27:01 - and it all depends which niche you want
27:02 - to take because there is no such thing
27:04 - as you know learning blockchain
27:05 - completely it's like learning intro
27:07 - completely there are so many things i
27:09 - can do front-end back-end devops i can
27:11 - go into spark cassandra
27:14 - i mean all of the different back-end
27:16 - systems it's impossible to know
27:17 - everything so you need to pick your
27:19 - niche if you want to be in front and for
27:21 - example you can check out web3 ui kit on
27:23 - github which is also a project that
27:25 - we're contributing to a lot and
27:28 - that's where you can find a react
27:29 - library which is compatible with your
27:32 - current knowledge and you can very very
27:33 - simply plug and play it into web three
27:35 - so web3 akit if you are a web3 developer
27:38 - if you want to write smart contracts you
27:39 - need to learn hard hat you need to learn
27:41 - solidity and it's going to be a longer
27:44 - journey but i think you need to do that
27:45 - because it will show you how you write
27:48 - your own smart contracts you can program
27:50 - money it shows you how to program money
27:52 - the fact that you can and it's not
27:53 - difficult to start imagine you have
27:56 - you have a
27:58 - java class or python class but you
28:02 - change a few syntax syntax
28:05 - ways of writing different variables and
28:07 - and loops and stuff like that and now
28:09 - you have a solidity program which can
28:10 - accept money it can decide what to do
28:12 - with money so learn solidity and you're
28:14 - gonna use solids together with hard hat
28:16 - so hard hat is like this dev tool that
28:18 - allows you to deploy contracts and to
28:20 - manage your contracts um absolutely well
28:23 - also by the way before you before you do
28:24 - any of this you need to of course
28:26 - install metamask and figure out how that
28:28 - works and use use the different
28:30 - applications use openc use uni swap you
28:33 - have to be a web 3 user first before you
28:35 - can be a developer i mean that's that's
28:37 - an obvious thing but very easy to miss
28:39 - and an important thing to mention
28:40 - because many people that want to be in
28:42 - web 3 they may not even use web3 yet so
28:45 - maybe spend a few months just using it
28:47 - you need to so for example if i were to
28:49 - give you a list buy an nfc on openc
28:52 - figure it out make a trade with uni swap
28:54 - figure it out
28:56 - go into why earn
28:58 - uh and do some uh stake some assets
29:01 - there and earn some yield uh
29:04 - poke around with this maybe invest in
29:05 - some ico like just just for trying one
29:08 - of these token launches it's not even
29:10 - called ico nowadays it's called the
29:12 - launch pads so you can go to launchpad
29:13 - just you know try it out put in 50 bucks
29:15 - see what happens so you understand how
29:17 - to claim tokens how to stake tokens how
29:20 - to participate in all of these different
29:22 - operations that people do in web3 like
29:24 - for example launch pass when you when
29:26 - you tokens launch of course don't put
29:28 - any serious money into this because you
29:29 - don't know anything you're probably
29:30 - going to lose it
29:32 - because of the many ways you can also
29:34 - lose funds in this industry that's how i
29:35 - got it that's how i got it
29:38 - yeah
29:42 - you're gonna lose more by not trying
29:44 - you're gonna lose more in opportunity
29:46 - cost by being on the sidelines so best
29:48 - you lose you know you let's say you get
29:50 - drug pulled which is a way of uh
29:52 - as a way of saying that you've been
29:54 - scammed uh let's say you get dragged
29:56 - okay lose 100 bucks you maybe you lose a
29:58 - whole career if you don't try it so uh
30:01 - exactly that's a good one you lose more
30:03 - money by not trying it that's very true
30:06 - yeah that's golden man that is uh that's
30:09 - a golden one that's exactly what i
30:11 - thought i said i thought man i'll lose
30:13 - much more if i don't try and i went in
30:16 - with the money that i was willing to
30:17 - lose because how do i expect to win i'm
30:19 - brand new to it you know it's like going
30:21 - to tennis for your first time and just
30:22 - going i'm gonna crush everybody
30:24 - no you're not you're gonna lose you're
30:26 - gonna get destroyed
30:27 - like i came back from jiu jitsu today
30:29 - and i i'm like relatively new to it
30:32 - everybody just smashes me and i'm just
30:33 - like tapping out you know it doesn't
30:34 - matter who they are they're like choking
30:36 - me out
30:37 - so i expect to lose i'm like that with
30:40 - the whole world of crypto i jumped in
30:42 - expecting to lose but
30:45 - i love all the strategies that you were
30:47 - giving at the end which is like buy an
30:49 - nft you know even if it's like ten
30:51 - dollars like some it can be the smallest
30:54 - cheapest nfts you guys can buy
30:56 - actually make a trade and you'll end up
30:59 - learning so much i learned way more by
31:01 - actually doing things
31:03 - then like any blog article that i read
31:05 - because i understood oh there's like eth
31:07 - and then there's weath which is wrap
31:09 - teeth and you can convert it like this
31:10 - and yes i need to use uniswap and
31:14 - i was trying to do some really degen
31:15 - stuff and like my friend was showing me
31:17 - slippage and
31:19 - all this crazy stuff and exactly
31:21 - but you don't have to get too deep just
31:23 - just build a wallet so you you get a
31:26 - metamask wallet you get some heath into
31:28 - it uh so you fund it with some heath
31:31 - then you do some trades with nfts with
31:33 - uni swap and uh do maybe spend maybe a
31:36 - few days doing that then you can start
31:38 - developing so you can go to morales you
31:40 - can go to docs.morales. and then you
31:42 - will start learning how to build a
31:44 - dashboard for your wallet
31:46 - so basically the next step is just build
31:48 - a website in react where you can connect
31:51 - your wallet and where your website can
31:53 - then show you all of the things you've
31:54 - done
31:55 - so you can show this one so you can
31:57 - build
31:58 - then you can build yourself a website
31:59 - that shows okay you have this many if
32:01 - you have this many tokens this many nfts
32:03 - then you hear all your transactions
32:05 - because then you you can start you know
32:07 - you start feeling ah man this is
32:08 - actually programmable stuff you know i
32:10 - can connect yeah i really like that i
32:12 - want to actually build that for myself
32:14 - because i hate opening metamask i think
32:17 - their ui is like terrible
32:19 - um
32:20 - phantom has an amazing ui but like
32:23 - metamask ui like yeah so i would want to
32:25 - build something of my own that shows how
32:27 - i'm using the money the trend that dude
32:30 - that's actually a great idea
32:32 - so next in the roadmap is that you can
32:34 - create your own coin so after you've
32:36 - done this that you've just interacted
32:37 - with a bunch of stuff you can use
32:39 - morales to build the dashboard next you
32:41 - can launch your own coin using uh
32:43 - solidity and hard hat and you don't even
32:45 - need to know solidity because there are
32:46 - templates so you can go to open zeppelin
32:49 - which is a website with all a bunch of
32:50 - different smart contract templates and
32:52 - when you want to launch a coin you
32:54 - basically deploy a smart contract you
32:55 - deploy a a small program which is like a
32:58 - java class you can think about it but
33:00 - it's solidity solidity class but
33:02 - instantly it's not called class it's
33:03 - called smart it's called contract and
33:05 - you deploy it and you just say hey this
33:07 - this coin it has a million coins in
33:10 - circulation and you give them all to
33:12 - your wallet and then you can send it to
33:13 - the different other wallets so that way
33:16 - you've also now deployed something on
33:18 - chain you've deployed an asset on chain
33:20 - you've you've done something you know
33:22 - you've you've started programming money
33:24 - it's not only that you program where you
33:25 - read from your wallet which was the
33:27 - dashboard step now you've actually
33:28 - deployed your own asset you're
33:30 - programming on the blockchain now
33:32 - and yeah i mean then sky is the limit
33:33 - look at that point you will you will
33:35 - know enough to figure out the rest
33:37 - yourself because you know at some point
33:38 - you reach some escape velocity and you
33:40 - know how to research on your own then
33:42 - you kind of know you know oh i want to
33:44 - learn about lending or oh i want to
33:45 - learn about more nft
33:48 - more nfc related technologies so when
33:51 - you reach that escape velocity you will
33:52 - understand on your own where to go which
33:54 - tutorials to watch you will become
33:56 - independent
33:57 - i love that
33:58 - um
33:59 - this question looks pretty good so i'll
34:02 - pop that up here hamza asks do we need
34:04 - to have previous software engineer
34:06 - experience to excel in web3 or starting
34:08 - in web3 and sticking into it will also
34:11 - help us excel as some big web 3
34:13 - companies like consensus want that
34:16 - experience
34:18 - well i think if you are completely new
34:20 - it's like with all programming it's
34:22 - better if you have programming
34:23 - experience than not have of course so
34:25 - you just know that you will probably
34:27 - have to learn the basics first probably
34:29 - it's better to learn javascript first
34:30 - before going into web three or so
34:32 - literacy is because in javascript you
34:33 - have big community a lot of books
34:35 - tutorials courses so i would say before
34:38 - going into web3 learn javascript and
34:40 - learn you know normal programming
34:42 - because it's all needed anyway in web3
34:44 - you are learning web3 by learning
34:45 - javascript and then you can enter
34:48 - afterwards and you know if some big webs
34:51 - like someone like consensus will hire
34:53 - you uh i don't know if that's the it's
34:55 - like entering you know web 2 and asking
34:57 - will google hi i don't know man
35:00 - probably there are way more
35:02 - opportunities for you to do something on
35:03 - your own or or do something else than to
35:05 - aim for google instantly because it's
35:07 - not even for everyone but and even if it
35:10 - is it's uh basically no consensus they
35:11 - do mathematics so it's like it will
35:13 - matamus hire you i don't know maybe in a
35:15 - few years if you work hard
35:18 - yeah no i agree i agree um yeah these
35:21 - are these companies are kind think of it
35:24 - like
35:24 - the google of tomorrow and uh you know
35:27 - the facebooks of tomorrow these are like
35:29 - the big companies that are growing
35:32 - you have you have more
35:34 - chances of honestly joining one of these
35:36 - than like say google because they have
35:38 - like standardized their way of testing
35:40 - and they're so rigorous
35:42 - right now with web3 what i've noticed
35:43 - opportunity is insane
35:45 - um and a lot of people and companies
35:48 - just want talent that's willing to even
35:50 - show that they're willing to learn
35:52 - because everybody's new like most people
35:54 - honestly have months of freaking
35:55 - experience um and i know founders that
35:58 - are hiring them you know including
36:00 - myself and so
36:02 - i think as long as you have your heart
36:04 - and passion in there you can definitely
36:06 - jump in and it's a very practical
36:08 - um thing for you so you know going going
36:11 - on the whole thing of you're like okay
36:13 - learn solidity learn these learn these
36:15 - technologies and then you can start
36:16 - building stuff
36:18 - you know then what like so i i i learn
36:21 - stuff i can build stuff with this
36:24 - then what do i just start applying to
36:26 - jobs or do you do you stand by your way
36:28 - of
36:29 - i go into communities and just start
36:31 - adding a ton of value there as a
36:32 - developer
36:33 - well i mean it depends who you are as a
36:35 - person if you are more entrepreneurial
36:37 - you could
36:38 - see a problem in the industry and it can
36:40 - be many different problems so for
36:41 - example it can be that you come from a
36:44 - country and you see oh there's no like
36:46 - reporting tax tool for your country or
36:48 - it may be oh i see
36:50 - this use case with defy but there are no
36:52 - good wallets for it maybe let's create a
36:54 - wallet or you see some other thing like
36:57 - there is a coin but it's not easy to to
36:59 - take it cross chain maybe you can build
37:00 - a bridge and in all of these different
37:03 - uh different use cases there are of
37:05 - course ways to monetize it whether it is
37:07 - that you have some kind of fee or you
37:09 - have some kind of token that you can
37:11 - monetize through it's you really going
37:13 - to figure it out yourself as you go
37:14 - along but at the end of the day it
37:16 - depends who you are maybe you want to
37:18 - join a company like a consensus or
37:20 - something else maybe you want to join a
37:22 - traditional maybe you see that hey you
37:24 - have a big company that is web 2 and now
37:26 - they're going into web 3 and you can
37:28 - help them a lot because you you are now
37:30 - one of the top experts in the world
37:32 - because you've studied for two months
37:35 - [Laughter]
37:45 - when you start getting into this you
37:46 - will see more and more opportunities
37:48 - popping up it's kind of like you know
37:49 - you and i we're thinking about the
37:50 - medical field we're like so okay i
37:52 - learned medicine and then what i'm a
37:54 - doctor i am like you know local hospital
37:56 - that that's that's my limit but of
37:57 - course not there are probably like many
37:59 - different different ways that you can
38:01 - excel but before you start entering into
38:03 - this into space you you won't notice
38:05 - them so start start doing and then and
38:08 - invest your time because it will be
38:09 - worth it at the end of the there's
38:11 - nothing else you can spend your time on
38:12 - right now that will be as worth it as
38:14 - web 3.
38:15 - right exactly and a lot of it is about
38:17 - timing right right now doctors might not
38:20 - be exploding but like when the world war
38:22 - ii was going on i mean holy the
38:24 - opportunity to become a medical or
38:26 - doctor was probably exploding right it's
38:28 - like
38:29 - that matters um
38:31 - gregory horn has a really good one and
38:33 - ivan by the way whenever you have to
38:35 - leave just let me know it's all good but
38:37 - i just feel like we got a good energy
38:39 - going good questions coming through so
38:40 - i'm gonna keep going on my own
38:42 - gregory says asks is it preferable to
38:45 - develop a dap that runs on a web 2
38:47 - traditional domain or a web 3 blockchain
38:50 - domain as part of a portfolio
38:53 - well you can do both you can show that
38:55 - you know how to do web 2 and web 3
38:57 - because it's it doesn't you can have
38:58 - both but of course most dapps they are
39:01 - still in web 2 domains although you can
39:03 - of course use ens or you can use
39:05 - unstoppable domains or other protocols
39:07 - and now there is also a handshake i
39:08 - think is another one but none of them
39:10 - are really you know massive and
39:14 - you can definitely do both in most cases
39:17 - that you have a web 2 version and then
39:19 - you can upload it on ipfs and connect an
39:21 - ens domain for example
39:24 - yeah
39:24 - absolutely that's amazing
39:26 - um that's a that's a great way to answer
39:29 - that question people are really enjoying
39:32 - that we're both on here they're like yo
39:33 - ivan is ivan and kazi on the same stream
39:36 - let's go
39:38 - this is sick we'll definitely want to
39:39 - have you on here more
39:41 - um
39:42 - there are many critics about nfts that
39:44 - are ponzi scheme and web 3's a hype any
39:46 - thoughts on these i know kind of what
39:48 - your thoughts are
39:49 - um yeah and i know generally kind of
39:51 - what people's consensus are i don't know
39:53 - if you want to expound on this at all
39:55 - well yeah i mean i can i can speak for
39:57 - hours about this well first and foremost
39:59 - ponzi scheme people don't know what it
40:01 - means when they even say it i mean what
40:03 - is a ponzi scheme ponzi scheme is i take
40:05 - money from you i promise you a big
40:07 - return
40:08 - and then i i promise the same return to
40:10 - the other guy and then i take his money
40:12 - and give to you as your return and then
40:14 - i find the third guy and i give his
40:15 - money to the second guy and you know
40:17 - that that's a ponzi scheme all right
40:18 - nfts is just like any other market where
40:21 - people buy and sell things there's no
40:24 - promise of return there's no one that
40:26 - takes your money and says hey you give
40:27 - it to me i promise you that that would
40:28 - be a ponzi scheme
40:30 - nfcs are just assets that people trade
40:33 - with any assets whether it is real
40:34 - estate stocks nfts you can have a market
40:38 - where the prices are irrational they go
40:40 - up into in the skies and people become
40:43 - greasy and there's a lot of speculation
40:44 - which means that yes we may have a crash
40:46 - and people that bought at the top will
40:49 - lose money and people that sold at the
40:50 - top of the market will will earn money
40:52 - so it's just natural and look whenever
40:54 - there is a new technology it always
40:56 - creates these bubbles if you look back
40:59 - when trains were a new thing you go you
41:02 - can google this if you're watching this
41:04 - stream go google railway mania you will
41:06 - you will find
41:08 - that in
41:09 - 1800 or something like that 1800 in
41:11 - britain there was a new railway company
41:14 - starting each month why because railways
41:16 - people thought man trains you know
41:18 - railway it's crazy we can transport
41:20 - things across continents let's build
41:23 - companies less invest less
41:25 - great things using trains well of course
41:27 - it became a railway mania and how many
41:30 - railway companies you have now per
41:32 - country one maybe two so it consolidated
41:35 - the same thing with cars go and watch
41:37 - how many car manufacturers there were at
41:39 - the beginning of the of the previous
41:42 - century hundreds and hundreds now
41:44 - everyone was starting a car company
41:46 - let's build cars it's a new technology
41:48 - it was hyped you know people were doing
41:49 - cars left and right and and it was a
41:51 - hype it consolidated now maybe then you
41:54 - have mercedes you have audi you have a
41:56 - few others uh the same thing with
41:58 - internet early on everyone says let's do
42:00 - a dot com this dot com that people were
42:02 - following in there was a financial
42:04 - bubble and and then it's consolidated so
42:06 - probably something is going to be with
42:07 - nft most of this project is going to die
42:09 - a few of them are going to be successful
42:11 - and it's it's always like that when a
42:13 - new technology comes that is great it's
42:14 - going to create the hype is going to
42:16 - create a bubble people going to earn
42:17 - money people are going to lose money
42:18 - that are speculating but people who
42:20 - build and actually do something in this
42:22 - industry they are the guaranteed winners
42:24 - absolutely um yeah i think like
42:28 - building you can't go wrong with
42:30 - building because even if you like let's
42:32 - say lose financially in the short term
42:34 - you're gaining so much experience
42:36 - actually build something greater in the
42:37 - future so i feel like with building you
42:39 - can rarely go wrong at the very least
42:42 - you've developed your skill set and now
42:44 - you can go work for a company right so
42:46 - that's the big thing about building this
42:48 - is a really good question we have a
42:49 - senior developer in the house
42:52 - and he asks is moving to blockchain
42:54 - solidity a good idea for
42:57 - somebody with 13 years of experience
42:59 - with java node.js and archetype
43:02 - architect experience as well and how
43:04 - much salary on average can be expected
43:06 - considering person is already on good
43:08 - salary
43:10 - well i mean you can definitely expect
43:13 - very very competitive salaries i mean
43:15 - we're seeing everything from 200k to you
43:17 - know 300 and above in in some cases
43:19 - depending on your level of seniority
43:21 - because you have to understand smart
43:22 - contracts if you deal with hundreds of
43:24 - millions of dollars
43:25 - which if you are good you will you will
43:27 - be doing that i mean your code will be
43:29 - guarding hundreds of sometimes billions
43:31 - of dollars in this industry uh so of
43:33 - course when you're dealing where you do
43:35 - when you're dealing with that and uh i
43:37 - mean we also have many hacks you can
43:39 - just google recently we had the 600
43:41 - million dollar hack you can google run
43:43 - in the network hack it was last week 600
43:46 - million was stolen uh but uh this is the
43:49 - kind of things that you're you're doing
43:51 - in this space i mean you're programming
43:53 - money you're programming money so of
43:55 - course it it it can go it can it can
43:57 - vary a lot but if you're really
43:59 - successful and you know what you're
44:00 - doing then the sky's the limit and uh
44:03 - you should definitely start starting
44:06 - solidity juice if you are if you are but
44:08 - it depends on you on who you are of
44:10 - course if you're hungry you know you're
44:12 - hungry for success you're hungry for new
44:14 - adventures you're hungry for new uh new
44:17 - horizons then it's a no-brainer if you
44:18 - want to be a java developer with a good
44:20 - salary and feel comfortable then don't
44:22 - do it if you want to be in new horizons
44:24 - and explore new things and and take on a
44:26 - new industry then it's a no-brainer of
44:28 - course but yeah i don't want to say that
44:30 - everyone should do it because there are
44:30 - different situations look if you have
44:32 - family and kids you want to be very safe
44:34 - stick with your java and where you are
44:36 - right now if you are a bit more risky
44:38 - you know you want to try the solidity
44:40 - thing maybe work in a few protocols
44:41 - maybe it works out or it doesn't work
44:43 - out uh then absolutely it's a you should
44:46 - do it you should do it
44:48 - yep and as you were talking i don't know
44:50 - if you saw but i was just highlighting
44:51 - job opportunities
44:53 - and yep and you got your averages so
44:56 - these are averages on the left middle is
44:58 - the minimum and then these are some of
45:00 - the maxes you know
45:02 - um on the on the really really high end
45:04 - so you guys can go to web3.com yeah
45:07 - i i think i think that one is good for
45:09 - but i think the the what they got wrong
45:11 - in that list is the highest because uh
45:14 - once again i mean a lot of these devs
45:15 - they they guard hundreds of millions i
45:17 - think when it comes to the highest it's
45:19 - it's got to be higher than that i mean
45:20 - in many cases yeah i saw i saw some that
45:23 - were 600 000 to 750 000 as well
45:26 - um and uh you know you i think you know
45:29 - alex becker too in the field right i
45:31 - mean at least watch his videos and stuff
45:33 - and his developer who helped him launch
45:35 - neo tokyo i think cleared over a million
45:38 - millions of dollars you know working
45:40 - with them yeah so you have those rare
45:42 - right because a lot of companies what
45:43 - they're doing is they're giving a
45:44 - percentage
45:46 - as well of like the token or whatever
45:48 - exactly and and i think in many cases if
45:51 - you are a very good solution developer i
45:53 - mean very very good release developer uh
45:55 - but i would do that i would
45:58 - go into some kind of project that is
46:00 - doing some kind of nfc or some kind of
46:02 - asset and
46:04 - i would instead of having a big salary i
46:06 - would instead go for tokens yeah
46:08 - i love that
46:09 - yeah basically you're almost getting
46:11 - equity in those in the company that
46:13 - you're that you're with you know and i
46:14 - love the idea of tokens because i think
46:16 - when will morales release its tokens do
46:19 - you guys have something like that
46:22 - well we it could be on the roadmap
46:24 - nothing is decided yet but you know
46:25 - before we do it we want to be we want to
46:28 - be fully established you know we want to
46:30 - be
46:31 - already massive we don't want to do a
46:32 - token you know and then we're going to
46:34 - do things which unfortunately what most
46:36 - people do we want to do a token when
46:38 - when we have already changed the world
46:40 - to such an extent that our token is
46:42 - already the number one on uh on the
46:44 - number one page on coin market cap
46:45 - easily we don't want to be you know on
46:47 - some you know page ten coin market so
46:49 - for us we we're delivering first we're
46:51 - delivering first and uh and then what
46:54 - happens happens here
46:55 - wow i love that i will tell you one
46:57 - thing um
46:59 - this is
46:59 - something rare
47:01 - but i
47:02 - i look for a lot of qualitative feedback
47:04 - regarding people's products and services
47:06 - and things like that
47:08 - morales has really good
47:10 - qualitative feedback that i've been
47:12 - seeing around like
47:14 - you know i'm not even trying to push
47:15 - this down anybody's throats i'm not even
47:17 - like mentioning it's like from people in
47:19 - the community youtube videos even videos
47:22 - where we weren't doing morales like
47:24 - there will be a comment here and they're
47:25 - talking about hey can we use morales and
47:28 - i really like it so
47:30 - that's big man that's big to do that
47:32 - that's good here
47:34 - that's good to hear that's good to you
47:36 - yeah you guys should i mean you guys
47:37 - should be very proud of yourselves and i
47:39 - think you guys are building something
47:40 - phenomenal
47:41 - um really makes developers jobs easier
47:45 - so that's amazing
47:46 - um
47:48 - ivan
47:49 - do you have any more thoughts or
47:50 - anything more that you
47:52 - want to add oh by the way guys that was
47:54 - the april fool's joke
47:56 - i'm not deleting the channel um
47:59 - [Laughter]
48:02 - yeah i i shot i shot off twitter because
48:05 - you know i accidentally started to
48:07 - retweet some stuff which were like
48:09 - they kind of sounded true but then i
48:12 - realized man i've been retweeting the
48:14 - jokes like i've been there was a guy who
48:16 - said i'm starting my i started my first
48:19 - day at google today but you know goodbye
48:20 - web3 i was like whoa fantastic you know
48:23 - still good you know it's google
48:26 - [Laughter]
48:28 - and then i was like wait wait wait
48:30 - yeah then i i deleted everything shut
48:33 - the shot off twitter until tomorrow
48:36 - oh man um
48:38 - yeah i big bill i see what you said
48:40 - senior back-end developer has paid more
48:42 - than junior blockchain developers are
48:44 - switch-worthy um
48:46 - i don't know you decide man you decide i
48:49 - think that you could go into job
48:50 - opportunities
48:52 - that have back end involvement plus they
48:56 - want you to do blockchain and they might
48:58 - be willing to pay you a decent amount to
48:59 - be able to do that because like it's not
49:01 - it's not like all of a sudden
49:03 - web 2 is just vanished you know
49:05 - what i mean like
49:07 - um you still need web 2.
49:10 - um
49:11 - like if you don't have your web 2 wi-fi
49:13 - your web 3 won't work
49:16 - exactly that's true and you know i mean
49:18 - at that it all depends on the person
49:20 - yeah if let's say like you say if you're
49:22 - a back-end developer and you can slowly
49:24 - nudge yourself towards web3 maybe let's
49:27 - say you're a back-end developer and
49:28 - you're in a big company maybe you can
49:30 - just start pushing for web 3 projects
49:33 - because i assure you that all
49:35 - corporations they want to be in web 3
49:37 - they want to be in in metawars they want
49:39 - to because for them it's important
49:40 - because they're investors the the
49:42 - shareholders this the stock price may
49:46 - may demand that that hey why are we not
49:49 - expanding why are we not exploring we're
49:50 - gonna be dinosaurs and if you then can
49:53 - start you know nudging yourself you're
49:54 - not taking too big of a risk maybe you
49:56 - you're in a big corporation you're
49:58 - starting to move more towards web three
49:59 - maybe you can establish a website
50:01 - department you can be the webster guru
50:03 - evangelist in your company i mean that
50:05 - alone can 5x your salary probably
50:08 - probably if you show that you're like
50:10 - the best expert they've got on this
50:11 - probably you can 5x your salary
50:13 - yeah
50:14 - there was a great question that came in
50:16 - earlier that i didn't ask earlier but
50:17 - i'll ask now
50:19 - um
50:20 - somebody asked um what kind of potato
50:22 - are you using for your camera ivan
50:27 - that's a good one so actually yeah i i i
50:30 - have a new lens a new lens that should
50:32 - do my background very blurry and uh and
50:35 - very nice but it's it's too much blur
50:37 - and i still haven't figured out you know
50:39 - which you know how how we should and
50:41 - look i'm so bad with cameras you know i
50:43 - i i think you just click on it but yeah
50:46 - at least you can hear me you can use it
50:47 - as audio
50:49 - yeah
50:50 - i think i think it's just your wi-fi is
50:52 - down i i think your camera or maybe
50:54 - wi-fi yeah i think it's just your wi-fi
50:56 - is making it look like that
50:58 - um yeah yeah cool this is doobie had a
51:01 - follow-up who you know the senior
51:03 - blockchain no not the senior blockchain
51:05 - engineer but just senior developer it
51:07 - seems like who wanted uh blockchain
51:09 - uh info and he's like i'm doing a ton of
51:12 - udemy courses are there accredited
51:15 - certifications which have value
51:17 - in the industry helpful in getting a job
51:19 - like a blockchain council or something
51:22 - no no um it could be if you are uh
51:26 - applying to
51:27 - two jobs in the web too like let's say
51:29 - you want to web blockchain ibm or
51:32 - something they may care about these
51:34 - things if you if you work in west groves
51:37 - and you build this
51:38 - it's uh yeah you you're not gonna need
51:41 - it uh this certifications they're mainly
51:43 - for
51:44 - uh corporations uh they're mainly that
51:47 - you can say that you you have it and
51:48 - corporations can say you know we've
51:50 - educated because imagine i'm a middle
51:52 - manager in a preparation i want to show
51:54 - that i've pushed my my team into web
51:57 - three so maybe i'll buy them some
51:59 - certificate just to just to say okay
52:01 - guys now we're certified uh and uh so
52:04 - that's mainly what i'm seeing that it's
52:06 - it's a lot for uh corporate use case
52:08 - that they want to upskill their
52:09 - workforce and get them into into
52:12 - blockchain but practically it's it's not
52:15 - really needed if you work in this
52:16 - industry
52:18 - and it probably as this industry matures
52:20 - they're going to be more and more needed
52:21 - but right now i i rarely see that it's
52:24 - some kind of decisive factor whether you
52:26 - have some certification or not instead
52:28 - is your portfolio are you active in
52:30 - communities do you know the protocols do
52:31 - you know how this industry works that's
52:33 - way more important
52:34 - yeah i i agree with you on that i think
52:37 - it's like
52:38 - on the blockchain you just build things
52:40 - that you can show them literally on the
52:42 - blockchain be like here's what i've
52:43 - built and as long as you can go in with
52:46 - what you've built i think that's going
52:47 - to speak way more volume than uh
52:50 - a piece of paper would at least in this
52:52 - industry and i love that answer like web
52:54 - 2 companies would probably care but
52:56 - other companies wouldn't care that much
52:58 - yeah nice i like that you caught that my
53:01 - camera my my camera is potatoing
53:04 - it's all good it's all good
53:07 - this is a good question i think because
53:09 - you know going off of okay we want to
53:11 - make a hundred thousand dollars a year
53:13 - as a blockchain developer what are the
53:14 - steps what are the processes so this
53:16 - question goes along with that theme
53:17 - really well ubang asks so what is the
53:20 - right way of learning web3 and smart
53:22 - contracts in that case
53:25 - hey look at that dude yeah there you go
53:28 - and and another option another angle
53:30 - well the right way to learn about three
53:31 - smart contracts is is by doing is by
53:33 - doing so maybe you can watch a few
53:35 - tutorials just just uh search web three
53:39 - tutorials soliz tutorial you can go to
53:41 - morales academy we have a bunch of
53:42 - courses and tutorials there as well and
53:44 - there we can also we give you a
53:47 - counselor basically someone that will
53:48 - help you and guide you if you want more
53:50 - personal approach like that go to
53:52 - morales academy but as soon as you got
53:54 - the basics you know you kind of know how
53:55 - to do a smart contract you kind of know
53:56 - the basics like the bare basics
53:59 - then you need to build things so here's
54:00 - where you can watch clever programmer
54:02 - the builds or morales projects if you go
54:04 - to mariah's ios projects because that
54:06 - will give you the practical context that
54:08 - you need because without the practical
54:10 - context you're just gonna get stuck in
54:11 - the tutorial hell you're gonna watch
54:14 - videos and you know read some articles
54:16 - uh read you're gonna read twitter
54:18 - threads you're never gonna actually have
54:19 - the practical context so all in all uh
54:22 - learn uh some simple solidity you can
54:25 - find a lot on youtube or morales academy
54:27 - then um you can learn some simple uh
54:30 - web3 and react you can use web3ui kit
54:33 - and also
54:34 - again as soon as you feel that you kind
54:36 - of you can kind of do something with it
54:38 - build full projects build full projects
54:41 - so that's what what i would do
54:44 - i love that
54:45 - and what is a full project
54:48 - well for example what you guys are doing
54:50 - on the channel like web3
54:53 - twitter amazon i mean that's that's
54:55 - that's a good example or like we're
54:56 - doing on our
54:57 - channel at morales channel uh we'll do
55:00 - similar things and we also do game game
55:02 - engine integrations like for example if
55:04 - you want to do a unity game and you want
55:06 - to connect it with the blockchain we
55:07 - have a perfect
55:09 - course on that coming out on saturday to
55:11 - saturday for example
55:13 - so basically use cases finished use
55:16 - cases where you go from zero to done a
55:20 - use case can be that you build a
55:21 - dashboard for your wallet like i said
55:23 - maybe it's the simplest one then another
55:25 - use case can be that you launch a token
55:27 - and now you can have a dashboard for
55:28 - your wallet and your token where you can
55:29 - issue new coins you can transfer them
55:31 - you can you can do different things with
55:33 - your coin maybe stake them maybe burn
55:35 - them uh just very simple stuff that i'm
55:38 - thinking
55:39 - on the fly maybe next thing you have is
55:41 - that if you deposit
55:42 - one eth you get a token so you basically
55:45 - can build a as a token cell yes it's
55:47 - just just to this experiment you can
55:49 - have a smart contract a program on the
55:51 - blockchain which receives one if and for
55:53 - each if it receives it sends you 10
55:55 - tokens very simple thing
55:58 - next thing you can integrate with chain
55:59 - chain link maybe chain link is is next
56:02 - big frontier because when you integrate
56:04 - with chain link now you can have look if
56:06 - there is
56:07 - there is a frost
56:08 - if it's a minus degrees outside
56:11 - uh we paid the money if it's plus or
56:13 - yeah in fahrenheit or something else but
56:15 - look if it's cold outside we don't pay
56:16 - you if it's warm outside we pay you you
56:18 - can have real real world data into the
56:20 - blockchain this is of course important
56:22 - for insurance let's say that you have
56:24 - crops
56:26 - they're gonna die if it's too cold it
56:28 - would be nice if it was an automated
56:30 - smart contract that paid you instantly
56:32 - when it's too cold for example so you
56:34 - can start in you can start buying
56:36 - real apis from web 2 into the conditions
56:40 - that decide what happens to your to the
56:42 - funds in your smart contracts so yeah i
56:45 - mean some very simple stuff and then you
56:47 - will figure out and look you guys ask so
56:49 - many questions you know or should i do
56:50 - this or just just do something you know
56:53 - you're gonna be analyzing you you gotta
56:56 - be asking and analyzing just do it you
56:58 - know stop asking me questions you just
57:00 - start building and start thinking stop
57:02 - thinking because it's the same with in
57:04 - normal programming people ask me hey
57:06 - ivan should i do python or java or
57:07 - javascript i heard python is good for
57:09 - machine learning java is good for this
57:12 - corporate stuff javascript is good for
57:14 - web i'm you know i don't know what to
57:15 - choose there's also haskell and rust and
57:18 - a month later they still haven't decided
57:20 - they're still analyzing you know is it
57:22 - good salary and job man just just do
57:24 - it's not just star
57:25 - [Laughter]
57:27 - i love that yeah uh
57:30 - guys yeah seriously jump in i i love
57:32 - that i think you'll find out a lot of
57:34 - these answers by just jumping in um so
57:37 - that's good
57:38 - dude i had i had a random thought while
57:40 - you were talking i was like
57:42 - what if you like could you build
57:43 - something like where um i was just
57:45 - thinking of doing this literally with my
57:47 - friends where they could bet on youtube
57:49 - creators like how many views their next
57:51 - video is going to get and if that video
57:53 - gets that many views in the next three
57:54 - days to automatically get the money
57:57 - ah that's nice that's nice exactly
57:59 - exactly that's the perfect one for
58:02 - for uh uh
58:04 - for chain link that you can connect
58:06 - youtube api to your smart contract and
58:08 - let me tell you another thing you can
58:10 - have a lossless bet
58:12 - what do you mean by that let's say that
58:14 - you and i
58:15 - we bet on some outcome so you put in a
58:18 - thousand bucks i put in a thousand bucks
58:20 - and then we can put it
58:22 - into something like compound protocol we
58:25 - send it into a smart contract it starts
58:28 - earning interest so this money we put in
58:31 - you know in a week it may be not a 2 000
58:34 - bucks that we put in collectively maybe
58:36 - it's now
58:37 - 200. or i don't know the exact interest
58:39 - rates now but
58:40 - you can basically
58:42 - create a lossless lottery or a lossless
58:45 - bet where we only compete for the
58:48 - interest that we both generated so let's
58:50 - say you put in money i put in money we
58:52 - generate interest whoever wins gets the
58:55 - interest that we collectively generated
58:57 - the rest gets refunded to uh to to both
59:00 - i mean that's that would be impossible
59:02 - without web3 you cannot do something
59:04 - like this where you can earn interest
59:05 - like per second you know you earn
59:06 - interest per second in a bank you earn
59:08 - it you it's not like it's not real time
59:10 - so that is a sick idea that
59:15 - is so let me tell you another one
59:18 - another thing that is not possible
59:21 - uh without web3 that really bends your
59:23 - mind it's a flash loans
59:25 - where you can take millions of dollars
59:28 - you can right now if you know simple
59:30 - programming you can get 10 million
59:32 - dollars in your wallet with one
59:33 - condition you have to repay it in the
59:35 - same transaction so you get 10 million
59:38 - bucks if you don't repay it the whole
59:40 - transaction is just aborted it's
59:42 - reversed so you lose the funds but what
59:44 - does it mean it means that you can now
59:46 - funnel this money through smart
59:48 - contracts as long as you return it back
59:50 - in the same transaction it's all legit
59:52 - this means that let's say that i see an
59:54 - arbitrage opportunity i see that this
59:56 - coin is trading for one dollar on this
59:59 - exchange but it's trading for 0.9
60:01 - dollars on that exchange so i can take
60:03 - 10 million bucks i can buy it for 0.9 i
60:05 - sell for one dollar i return the loan
60:07 - it's it's all in the same transaction
60:09 - it's all in the same transaction and i
60:11 - keep the profit so this flash loan
60:13 - concept you should really look into if
60:15 - you if you're interested in the new
60:17 - financial primitives we call financial
60:19 - primitives basically this is this basic
60:21 - financial operations that you can do in
60:23 - web 3
60:24 - using smart contracts that you cannot do
60:27 - anywhere else uh and flashlights is a
60:29 - good example whatever arbitrage you see
60:31 - you can act on it with endless capital
60:34 - basically
60:35 - through this concept of flashlights
60:38 - damn
60:39 - that is so cool so flash loans makes
60:42 - sure that that transaction you're about
60:43 - to do
60:44 - it verifiably gives all the money back
60:46 - and if it doesn't it doesn't even fire
60:49 - off
60:50 - exactly just gets you so i mean
60:53 - okay so you can't um
60:56 - in simple words like i can't it up
60:58 - right like there's no way i can like
60:59 - just lose 10 million dollars like
61:01 - guarantee that if i borrow it it's gonna
61:03 - get back
61:04 - the the only thing you will lose is the
61:06 - transaction fee so all if he's a
61:08 - transaction transactions on ethereum
61:10 - need to pay fees but that's like any
61:11 - other transaction so the only thing you
61:13 - risk is the transaction fee because that
61:15 - you're going to pay either or even if
61:16 - transaction gets reverted and basically
61:18 - this loan fails so how do you how do you
61:21 - go through different exchanges and
61:24 - you know what i'm talking about give me
61:25 - one second i think she wants to go
61:27 - outside my bulldog yeah yeah sure
61:31 - sure
61:32 - yeah guys so for all you watching we're
61:34 - gonna get back soon
61:36 - there you go dog evacuated
61:39 - yeah so uh the way it works kind of like
61:43 - a promises in javascript you can do
61:45 - different things you can do you know do
61:46 - this request then take the response do
61:48 - that request and you can chain promises
61:50 - after each other and just funnel them
61:52 - you know
61:53 - one two one to the next and next and
61:55 - next and next the same is with the solid
61:57 - so you can say hey take the funds from
61:59 - here put it in this program okay take
62:00 - the output put it in that program take
62:02 - the output put it in that and you know
62:04 - if at the end of the day you have a
62:05 - profit because let's say you used an
62:07 - arbitrage you you bought some coin in
62:09 - here for 0.9 then you saw another place
62:11 - another program you could sell for one
62:13 - dollar you have a profit you return the
62:14 - loan perfect
62:16 - and by the way this is uh it's also a
62:18 - bigger topic because uh let's say that
62:20 - you you are smart and you see such an
62:22 - opportunity in the real world where you
62:24 - say hey wait
62:26 - there there are some assets trading
62:28 - cheap here and expensive there maybe on
62:30 - some stock exchanges or something else
62:32 - you cannot act on this opportunity
62:34 - without capital you cannot act on
62:36 - arbitrage without capital but now in web
62:38 - 3 everyone has endless capital to act on
62:41 - this arbitrage opportunities which in
62:43 - turn create efficient markets but that's
62:45 - a more economical topic but it's very
62:47 - interesting
62:48 - that's an amazing one have you messed
62:50 - around with it personally
62:53 - yeah yeah you can go to other let me see
62:55 - if they still have it in the docs docs
62:58 - our flashlight
63:00 - so you did a loan and you made like some
63:02 - profit i mean even if you lost money or
63:04 - something like that but you made yeah
63:05 - some money on it
63:07 - no no i i haven't done any money on it
63:10 - and by the way it's not it's not easy to
63:11 - do money on it because
63:12 - it would be easy everyone would do it so
63:15 - it's not easy to do it you really have
63:16 - to spend a lot of money finding this and
63:18 - because anyone can do it it also means
63:20 - that everyone does it all the time i
63:22 - mean that's why
63:23 - because the opportunity is open for all
63:25 - it's uh
63:26 - it means that it's very difficult to
63:28 - find a way in but
63:30 - you should
63:31 - research a recent example where somebody
63:33 - used it in a very smart way basically if
63:36 - you held
63:37 - if you held a board ape you know that
63:40 - you got eight ape coins
63:42 - and so some guy he did not have money
63:44 - for to buy an ape because an ape cost
63:46 - like 200k
63:47 - he got a flash loan
63:50 - he got he bought the nfts
63:52 - in one transaction so he gets
63:53 - flashlights like millions of dollars he
63:55 - buys the nfts
63:57 - he gets the airdrop token which is like
64:00 - uh hundreds of thousands of dollars
64:02 - he sells the nfts he returns the
64:05 - loan and he keeps the airdrop you can
64:07 - google it uh ape let me see if i can
64:10 - find it
64:11 - that's gene
64:12 - flash flashlight
64:14 - so
64:15 - exactly so
64:16 - just google it let's bring it up
64:18 - house
64:19 - just google apecoin flashlight so that's
64:21 - an example where look if you have brains
64:24 - you have now a tool with endless capital
64:26 - with endless capital
64:28 - to to act on those opportunities is it
64:30 - gonna be easy no this is not free money
64:32 - you have to be smart but
64:34 - you know that if you find a way where
64:36 - you need a lot of cash to buy something
64:38 - maybe to claim some airdrop like this
64:40 - guy he he didn't have money to buy eight
64:44 - it's a hundred of thousands of dollars
64:45 - to buy that eight ft but yeah you take
64:48 - penis of those flashlights you buy the
64:49 - ape you get the airdrop you sell the ape
64:51 - you return the loan you keep the
64:52 - airdrop jeez
64:55 - it included five this falls generated on
64:57 - the okay
64:59 - wow he bought a bunch of apes huh
65:03 - he bought a bunch of apes claimed the
65:04 - airdrop sold the apes returned
65:07 - they then sold these tokens on the
65:09 - decentral exchange for 398
65:12 - after this sold
65:13 - so
65:14 - with flash loans does all of this need
65:16 - to happen in a matter of like one second
65:18 - or can this happen over like
65:21 - so this needs to happen in one
65:22 - transaction yes
65:24 - but like that one transaction like
65:26 - but what i'm not understanding is how
65:29 - could you possibly do this so it's like
65:31 - is that one transaction happening over a
65:33 - period of seconds in real life or is
65:34 - that happening over like no no no you
65:36 - could take a week to make that
65:38 - transaction happen
65:40 - no no it needs to be in one transaction
65:42 - meaning that it's it basically needs to
65:44 - all happen uh in in the sequence
65:46 - basically when
65:47 - so how does the blockchain work you have
65:49 - blocks of transactions so on ethereum
65:51 - each 10 or 15 seconds a bunch of
65:54 - transactions get executed
65:56 - on the blockchain and so your
65:58 - transaction needs to be structured in a
66:00 - way where the version when the ethereum
66:02 - virtual machine executes it this all
66:04 - needs to uh this ultimate all needs to
66:07 - check out in uh when it does it at the
66:09 - same time so it's not like over weeks it
66:11 - needs to do it at the same time got it
66:13 - and uh
66:14 - each each uh each transaction has a
66:18 - certain gas limit so basically it means
66:21 - that each transaction you can say
66:24 - how much you're willing to pay for it
66:26 - and that will depend on how how many
66:28 - computational steps it has to do so
66:30 - there is a limit how much you can do you
66:32 - cannot you know you cannot have an
66:33 - infinite loop in a transaction that
66:35 - because you will run out of gas but yeah
66:37 - you could you could tell it hey you know
66:39 - go into this smart contract send money
66:41 - there take money from there and send it
66:43 - there and if it doesn't check out at the
66:45 - end let's say that you cannot return the
66:46 - flashlight the whole transaction is just
66:48 - invalidated it gets thrown out can i if
66:50 - it does check out yeah
66:52 - i was just gonna say can i do flash can
66:54 - you do flashlights on the devnet
66:58 - uh let's see because that's like so
67:01 - scary right like if the only place you
67:03 - could execute this is on the main net
67:08 - so by the way uh
67:10 - google how do flash loans let me send
67:13 - you a video because we've actually done
67:14 - it i think on a test net
67:16 - on avalanche which is like ethereum so
67:19 - if you go to uh youtube and you search
67:22 - d5 flash loans 2022 i think you'll find
67:25 - our video because
67:26 - we did it with
67:28 - one of our
67:29 - instructors danielle so google d5 flash
67:32 - loans 2022
67:34 - uh-huh there you go there we go flash
67:36 - loan course that one that one
67:38 - click on that one flashlight
67:40 - so this is on our channel
67:43 - is that danielle he's fantastic he's
67:45 - done this basically he where you execute
67:47 - and it's one hour long course on
67:49 - flashlights where you
67:51 - you have this app where you can try it
67:53 - and then he
67:54 - explains to you he uses ave and he does
67:56 - it on the avalanche test net where i
68:00 - think they have
68:01 - this capabilities yeah
68:03 - oh this is your house dude
68:06 - does he have a the code for me
68:09 - oh wow look at how nice he is
68:12 - what a nice guy
68:15 - got it you know i always when i was new
68:17 - i always thought this dot sol meant it
68:19 - was like dot soul
68:21 - but then i learned it's solidity i
68:23 - thought i was like wait i'm like
68:24 - everybody's developing solana huh
68:26 - interesting
68:29 - exactly
68:30 - oh okay wow but yeah here you can you
68:33 - can see her
68:34 - how it is
68:36 - damn so with so with smart contracts you
68:39 - and i we can publish programs on the
68:41 - blockchain and that program can be that
68:43 - hey you know take the flash loan do this
68:45 - do that it's like javascript now with
68:46 - promises you but with javascript
68:48 - promises is mainly requests you know you
68:50 - say go to this api then take the data go
68:53 - to that one and you chain them in a
68:55 - smart contract you can do the same thing
68:56 - but with funds you can say you know put
68:58 - in that one take take out you know mom
69:01 - and then you can do a transaction that
69:02 - calls that calls that
69:05 - smart contract and then it's going to
69:06 - execute it
69:09 - yeah no somebody says so the blockchain
69:11 - technology is all about trading no it's
69:12 - not all about trading it's just one
69:14 - aspect of it that he was showing we were
69:16 - talking specifically about flash loans
69:18 - so flash loans there's a lot of like
69:20 - trading arbitrage that you could pull
69:22 - off with flash loans
69:24 - so that is where we were talking about
69:26 - trades
69:27 - but a blockchain technology you could
69:29 - use it for a lot of things like for
69:30 - example you know where people are
69:32 - sending money to ukraine to fight off
69:34 - the russian war and that's the easy way
69:36 - for ukraine to collect money because i
69:38 - don't know how else i would send it but
69:40 - like with crypto it's super easy for me
69:42 - to send it and they can get it right
69:44 - away and so they've raised hundreds of
69:46 - millions of dollars because people are
69:48 - able to like i donated and usually i
69:51 - never donate anywhere just because it's
69:52 - like inconvenient but like here i was
69:54 - just going and it was so easy and simple
69:56 - and my wallet like i went to the website
69:58 - and my wallet just got connected and
70:00 - like i pressed one button i'm like yo
70:01 - this was super nice and and when you
70:04 - tried that i mean you that's where you
70:06 - see the light when you see your wallet
70:08 - being connected to all the different
70:09 - websites and you can start you're logged
70:11 - in instantly everywhere you can start
70:13 - interacting with all apps
70:15 - with your identity which is your wallet
70:16 - that's so amazing and this it's really
70:18 - when you see that you see that's how
70:20 - finance should have been on the internet
70:22 - that's minus on the internet that's
70:24 - that's how it will be i think i think
70:25 - the only things that that scare me that
70:27 - i don't understand how they would work
70:29 - is like some of it is
70:31 - so when i think of blockchain you know
70:33 - some of it makes me laugh because i'm
70:35 - like
70:36 - it's not crud anymore it's just cra
70:39 - cr because you can create and read but
70:42 - you can't update or delete so some of
70:43 - the things that confuse me are like
70:45 - okay if on instagram i make a post and
70:48 - then i'm like hey that was stupid let me
70:51 - go and delete that yeah yeah yeah
70:53 - you know and well that's why you don't
70:55 - use blockchain for that i mean
70:56 - blockchain is it's not uh it's not for
70:58 - everything
70:59 - that is something that you probably
71:01 - should not put on the blockchain but
71:02 - blockchain is for value that's i mean
71:03 - that's why in a way it's it's it's kind
71:05 - of connected to the financial space a
71:07 - lot because it's value it's value online
71:10 - you have value you have assets you have
71:12 - nfcs you have tokens you can trade them
71:14 - you can stake them and then you can
71:16 - connect them to other non-financial
71:18 - experiences like games for example like
71:21 - for example instagram you can have that
71:23 - if you uh if you get a lot of likes you
71:26 - you have some kind of membership
71:28 - coin generated or nfc generated
71:30 - or
71:31 - if you let's say that you are a music
71:33 - creator and a lot of people listen
71:35 - on your song on spotify you get a
71:37 - revenue share in real time so all of
71:39 - this value and ownership so blockchain
71:42 - is for value and ownership transactions
71:44 - and value and ownership programming
71:45 - which of course includes a bunch of
71:47 - trading because you can trade that but
71:48 - also includes you know how you store it
71:50 - you can for example say
71:52 - you know this this money we have here if
71:54 - you sign if you sign a transaction you
71:56 - cannot send you alone cannot spend it we
71:58 - need to be together to spend it maybe if
72:00 - we have a company together or maybe if
72:02 - we're five people we can say three of us
72:03 - need to accept the transfer uh three or
72:06 - five for example you accept transfer so
72:08 - that's why
72:09 - i think many people confuse it that you
72:11 - know everything should be on chain and
72:12 - you know and then they see but world of
72:14 - warcraft cannot run on chains so it's
72:16 - like if you guys so say you get two say
72:18 - you get two or three developer buddies
72:20 - and you guys are like hey we want to
72:22 - invest in courses and like learn about
72:24 - blockchain you could make this like
72:26 - dow type of thing with three of you
72:28 - where only all three of you have to
72:31 - agree to decide on buying a course
72:33 - that's like 10 bucks 20 bucks or
72:35 - whatever
72:36 - you know what i mean that's like fun
72:37 - that's like your 100 budget for learning
72:40 - blockchain or 200 budget for learning
72:42 - blockchain and you guys can all decide
72:44 - is that at a
72:46 - like person-to-person level you could
72:48 - use it that way or if you're founders of
72:50 - companies you guys could use it as like
72:52 - two founders deciding on a decision
72:55 - and um it's beautiful because it's trust
72:57 - less and so it it doesn't require trust
73:00 - like it's just guaranteed it needs to
73:02 - happen like that um i think some people
73:05 - were asking flash loan specific
73:07 - questions so tambo is like what is the
73:09 - maximum time for holding that flash loan
73:14 - it's not about time so there's no
73:16 - don't think about time because you you
73:18 - have a transaction i guess i guess like
73:19 - one thing i guess one thing that's like
73:21 - blowing blowing my mind my i'm having
73:23 - trouble wrapping my mind around is like
73:25 - how do you
73:27 - purchase like eight apes
73:30 - and then like go to unit swap and then
73:32 - sell them and then keep the airdrops
73:35 - like
73:36 - when that's happening in one transaction
73:37 - i'm thinking
73:38 - it's once one well it's very easy it's
73:41 - very i mean just think about
73:43 - a normal program so the computer
73:45 - executes a program the computer knows
73:47 - the state of the different data
73:50 - structures so for example the computer
73:51 - knows that okay these people have apes
73:54 - they and these people want to sell apes
73:57 - these people have apecoin and they give
74:00 - a coin if you have ape okay so then this
74:03 - guy comes and it's just you know a
74:05 - program that says okay uh
74:08 - send take money from the flash loan then
74:11 - buy buy ape with it it's it's just like
74:13 - imagine all of this was just data
74:15 - structures in your yeah and yeah and you
74:18 - can just change them and you know once
74:20 - you finish it you end up with a final
74:22 - state which is okay
74:24 - uh you have you have you got the edge
74:26 - from this guy because he gave you it
74:28 - because you have you had the ape which
74:29 - you got from the flashlight and the
74:31 - flashlight you got from these guys that
74:32 - give you a flashlight if you return it
74:34 - at the end of this execution which you
74:36 - now by the way can do because you have a
74:38 - profit and you can now return to these
74:39 - guys so this whole thing checks out it's
74:41 - accepted it's stamped put on the
74:43 - blockchain and the final state is that
74:45 - okay that their eight coins are now in
74:47 - your wallet the guy with a flashlight
74:49 - got his flashlight back because you
74:51 - return his funds and um the a the ape
74:55 - whoever sold you their ape they're happy
74:56 - because now they got the funds from the
74:58 - you know from your sales so it all
75:00 - checks out everyone's happy perfect so
75:02 - don't think about time because
75:04 - i i i don't know if that even makes
75:05 - sense to think about time because only
75:07 - here we have a block maybe with a
75:08 - thousand transactions i don't know how
75:10 - many it is in the block maybe a thousand
75:11 - and they all just get executed at the
75:13 - same time and uh so think about it with
75:15 - more as um
75:17 - as uh
75:18 - executions and uh they all happen at the
75:21 - same time then you wait 10 seconds the
75:23 - new block comes all of them are executed
75:25 - at the same time so there's no like
75:26 - don't think of it as time or something
75:28 - yet
75:29 - got it okay okay that makes sense i
75:31 - understand
75:32 - okay beautiful um
75:35 - wow so i think yeah people are enjoying
75:37 - this oh goron is here is this the
75:39 - same goron that i know i don't know
75:41 - maybe it's a different goron but
75:43 - we love you too goron so that's what's
75:45 - important
75:46 - um
75:47 - beautiful so i think we covered a lot
75:50 - man i mean people are still asking a ton
75:52 - of questions and somebody even asked
75:53 - like it seems like morales has all the
75:56 - tools like what what so what is the full
75:58 - stack on blockchain because they're like
76:00 - pretty much every tool they want to look
76:02 - up morales has so you know i guess what
76:05 - in that case if you have tools like
76:07 - morales what is the full stack on the
76:08 - blockchain
76:10 - well morales is doing a lot of the heavy
76:12 - lifting for you but for example you
76:14 - still need to uh you still need to do
76:16 - the solidity code yourself and program
76:19 - the smart contracts on your own so
76:22 - that's that's still needed so smart
76:23 - contracts are needed even with morales
76:25 - and i think if you google so you need to
76:27 - google d5 sorry
76:29 - web 3 tech stack let's see if if you go
76:32 - to youtube

Cleaned transcript:

how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year as a blockchain developer guys today is gonna be an amazing treat for you because you're gonna learn how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year as a blockchain developer and uh i brought on ivan who's the founder of morales to talk to you guys about it so ivan welcome brother welcome uh glad to have you here thanks man thanks man good to be here and by the way thanks a lot for inviting me because i know that your community is big you do so many great projects here on the channel and you have a very knowledgeable very respected community so good to be here thanks a lot absolutely man um this is awesome now we're actually live on youtube we weren't before yo what's up aaron we got guys today we are actually live so i'll be bringing up your questions or anything that you guys have along the way make sure to go ahead and mention that um and we'll bring them up but i think ivan a lot of people are seeing the crypto boom happening right so p some people are aping in and trying to invest their life savings but i feel like there's a much more guaranteed way to start making some income by doing something really useful and i and i feel like that has to do with being able to build on this platform and being able to use this technology of blockchain and to build on top of it you know what does that really mean how does somebody build on it and is there really opportunity here yeah that's a very good question and it's the correct place to start from because when you look at whoever is most successful in crypto is not the traders whether you look at vitalik or charles hoskinson or whoever that has done anything significant in the space they're builders they either build some kind of protocol or some kind of application or some kind of company so that's very important to realize that the biggest opportunity is building it is to create something in the space that that really makes an impact and it does the same thing with the insurance when the insurance was new you could trade some stocks yes it they they went up then they went down but the big opportunities f is everyone who actually started something a company a project so i totally agree that you have to build that's the best and most sure way to succeed in crypto in web three and when it comes to building you have to start off by understanding the tech tag and you have to start off by taking it very seriously and methodically and i have a whole video on youtube if you just google morales uh web3 techstack you will see i explain it for 15 minutes but on a big picture you can start even if you are a web developer if you're a web developer right now you can be a web 3 developer because of course all web three applications need front ends and from there you can start using different tools like ethers like web3.js or like morales which we build in order to log in users authenticate get their transactions interact with smart contracts and so on and so forth uh but there are many many things we can go into we can speak about frontend space in web3 we can speak about smart contracts we can we can go into many different directions so it's up to you where you want to go guys absolutely yeah so i think i want to start off with like the opportunity right because for for the broader perspective most of the people aren't developers who are into the blockchain space yet or the web3 space i think for a lot of the viewers that might be watching right now i think you know they might even be like what the heck is this you know what's the opportunity here yeah and so i think i want to start off with is there an opportunity here does that exist you know how much are these developers making is that real and then i think once we kind of cover that i feel like let's then dig deeper into you know the technologies they can use and how we can use maybe even think tools like morales to make their lives a lot easier well of course there's opportunities you can look at the wage statistics the salary statistics and i think web 3 is among the top it's even above the ai space and and iot space and everything else that is very up and coming in tech web3 is above all of that when it comes to salary and becomes your opportunity so that's one way of looking at it and another way of looking at it is that this technology no matter which salary you get now this this technology is really the next iteration of the internet so the salary itself in my mind does not really matter because all technologies that that are going to be monumental it's worth working in them no matter what i mean you could imagine if you could work for free in in web 2 in the 90s i mean just when these protocols were developing where you could like be one of the first developers to use ajax just to send some uh yeah yeah from your site i mean it doesn't matter what you get paid for you get to work with blazing edge technology so there is there is a lot of opportunity but i i personally i don't think a lot on on the actual salaries and wages because there are many things you can earn money it's more for a long term if you do this in 10 15 years you're gonna be one of the top experts in the world and that's the best thing with web web 3 it is very early on and you can actually become best in the world right you can imagine becoming best in the world with something like web development it's impossible all right it's important you will not be best in the world there's too many people doing that but web3 it's so new nobody is doing that so that's the biggest opportunity that you can do something for a few years and you can really become top in the world at it right you can see this is build companies build projects whatever you want them i was just gonna say i've seen so many developers man when i was i was trying to hire a lot of blockchain developers to work on our team and like the the people with the most amount of experience was crazy it was like five months four months one year and even exactly exactly when i looked at the market i'm like yo those are the senior developers like those are the senior developers right now so i feel like that way the opportunity is huge i love your points about it being bleeding edge right it's something new that people can jump into and start learning and be ahead of the curve because it's the advantage that people had who jumped on the internet and started developing on it or the people that started jumping on new languages and technologies were like the developers that were doing pascal and cobalt and stuff like that started becoming you know legacy technology that very few companies started using in the future and so i think to your point it's really beneficial to stay with the curve and like keep moving forward exactly and let's also speak about what web3 is because many people they they throw out the words web3 but they don't really understand it so web3 is all about the different protocols that ensure that we can have decentralized applications where value is part of the internet where value transfers and really the value holding and value creation is part of the intro protocols what does it mean for example if you have ether you can send it to anyone you can program it it's programmable money so we can hold value we can transfer value back and forth and we can build on it as an open product call and that's the best thing for me about web3 because it ensures that you and i have ownership rights and property rights on the internet because without property rights on the internet we will all be living online very soon you know zuckerberg is investing in diverse a lot now his whole company is called meta a lot of big tech companies are investing in them in the matters also because the trend is that we will all be spending more and more time online maybe in vr ar who knows how the actual form form factor is going to be but the trend is clear we're heading towards basically 24 7 online experience that's if you look at the screen time how much time we're spending in a few generations it's going to be all online but look if that happens do you and i own something there can we own assets can i own some kind of real estate some kind of item or do i not own it or is it just an entry in the database that can be erased at any moment which happens all the time with the platforming as you as you know so it's a very important uh concept this this concept of web3 is key it's a protocol for value and ownership which is global which is neutral meaning that no company no government controls it and most important for us as developers we can build on it we can program money we can create our own assets we can build lending borrowings synthetic assets derivatives you can program it you can never pro program this before web 3. before web three you have to bake paypal maybe they give you access to their api and maybe they shut you off tomorrow and what can you do you can accept payment that's it can you program if you have an innovative idea can you program it dude i'll tell you once i'll tell you i'll tell i'll tell you one story right so like one of the times i was when i launched my business um i started making an income from uh you know i was accepting money through paypal and uh i don't know it was like 20 30 000 that paypal saw come in and you know keep in mind i went from like not having any transactions go through paypal through all of a sudden have 20 30 000 comes through paypal flags it as a high risk potentially fraud type of thing and dude they locked up 20 or 30 grand from me for a year or two years you know and at that time that was everything for me when i was starting out and i was like this is this is and i couldn't control and i couldn't do anything talk to me is that something somebody could do to me in like if i was you know doing this in the crypto world if i i don't know if i had ethereum those 20 30 000 worth could could i be shut down or could they mark my stuff as as high risk and and keep me from getting my own funds so you can on a protocol level you can do whatever you want you you have your money you can transfer them it's cryptographic you have the private key for a wallet you can sign the transaction the network will accept it now of course if you have a bank or paypal for example they may ban your address if paypal adds a feature where you can cash out your crypto into dollars then they of course they might put restrictions but the whole point is that we can do transactions between each other without having the intermediaries without having paypal or banks in in the middle and that's only one use case for developers the best thing that has happened here is that we have the biggest sandbox development sandbox where you and i can build whatever you want issuing assets like i mentioned or programming money flows if i send so basically we can create more contracts smart contract is a program that can hold money and it can decide what to do with money based on our code and you program this smart contracts in solidity which is a programming language that you show very well on the clever programmer which is kind of like javascript it's so easy to start with and the we can program hey you send money to this program if this happens it will send it there if that happens if it will send it there that's maybe the the most simple program you can build if this then that or you can have something more complex that we can have a a an onchain exchange like for example with uni swab where people can trade assets back and forth i have ethereum you have usdt tether or something else we can trade between each other without intermediaries that's maybe the most insane use case so it's kind of like so just to uh connect it for everybody it's like when you say unit swap it's kind of like being able to exchange on there it's almost like being able to exchange on robinhood without it being centralized in any way and nobody controlling it and you just get to make your own trades exactly and the best thing you can embed it in your app meaning let's say you have a game and you want people to earn some ingame currency or maybe they kill a monster they have some loot they have some gold now they can trade that gold for east i mean that's crazy without is there just a protocol you don't have to apply to some you know verification get some paypal accept no you just integrate uni swap use a protocol you list your coin there anyone can lose their coin and now you can have is ingame swapping and anyone can do it you can be 12 years old you know simple javascript you can do it it's insane and that's really what i love the best that what what web3 is doing to value and money is basically what iphone did to phones because iphone ensures that you can now program phones you can program phones with iphone before you had nokia they gave you three applications they gave you sms they gave you phone calls and then they gave you the snake game and that's it and that's basically that's basically what what we have before web 3. before we have like paypal you have stripe and that's it you don't have anything else now with web3 uni can build anything with one so it's really opening up this whole potential for a whole development ecosystem where the full talent and the full potential of humankind is unleashed you can be a developer you can be whichever developer you want you can program you can build you can innovate so yeah i love that that is really powerful i love that example you gave with an iphone and by the way guys if you're here watching this smash that like button let's get this video out to more and more people let's please start smashing it and um we have a question here for you can a database of a blockchain be shareable so i imagine this question basically means you know hey if i have mongodb i can share it with people i can have people jump in you know can can that be something that's shareable well the whole idea with blockchain is that it sure it's shared by default it's open by default so all the ethereum transactions are readable and accessible by everyone so that's what we mean that is global and it's neutral meaning that anyone can read it anyone can write to it anyone can access it and it's amazing for storing financial transactions it's amazing for storing balances and all of these different basic basic features of a blockchain but of course it's not meant to be used for everything let's say that i have a game with 60 frames per second i mean of course i cannot run it on the blockchain because the blockchain it's very slow database and it is basically a mixture so for example when you look at ethereum or polygon or binance chain or avalanche it's it's a mixture of a blockchain uh of a database where you can just store transactions but also of a virtual machine where you can also execute your own custom logic your own smart contracts based on what's happening on the blockchain and you can send and you can program money to behave differently depending on what's happening on the blockchain so it's it's both blockchain definition of blockchain by itself is that it is this decentralized open database but also with a virtual machine where you can uh script what uh what will happen with the different coins and tokens depending on what happens uh which transactions happen on the blockchain in this database basically yeah absolutely okay so the short answer is yes it is shareable and the longer answer has i love what you said which is it's shared by shareable by default that's the whole you know idea behind but it's not for all use cases i mean if i let's say i have a game world i make world of warcraft but web3 i mean i cannot run it fully on chain it will not work because yeah we can only do seven transactions per second or so in e with layer two is faster but all the ingame ingame currency transfers and all of the monetary transfers that can be on chain the value transactions should be on chain and then everything else should be optioned because of course you cannot run the whole you know 3d 3d engine and all of that and all the game backend on chain it will not work but everything that has to do with asset with value with ownership transfers that can be unchained and that should be on chain yes got it um i'll giant has a comment that he he made that i think you'd appreciate and he says morales really made integration of web 3 and react really a piece of cake so kudos that's good nice work man that's good to hear um thank you just science guys just to provide some context guys morales is a software that you know ivan you've created right or you've worked with your team to create well like exactly exactly so i haven't created it but i'm one of the founders and we basically wanted to create an experience kind of like firebase kind of like super bass but in web 3 because before morales you had to have a backend team to even get started so for example when someone logs in with their wallet in your application if you don't use morales you need to create a backend where you verify the signature then you have to figure out how to get all of their assets which means that you need to integrate some kind of api and build out and scale it let's say you want to you have a smart contract you need to figure out how to listen to whatever happens in that smart contract to the different events so with morales we thought why why isn't there a solution which is just uh you know you your web interface where you can say hey um here are all the smart contracts i'm interested in just sync them all in real time and put it in my database or here is one line of code for you to insert in your front's application so you can accept users so that they can authenticate and we create user profiles and sessions and all of that so we basically took the the biggest use case possible which is logging users syncing user at the transactions seeking smart contracts swinky smart contracts event and made it as easy as possible with morales and yeah since then we've been growing it and we have a whole plugin ecosystem and things like that but the goal from the beginning was to create an experience that is familiar to all web 2 developers that have used like firebase for super i love that they want to go into web 3 yeah i love that i love your guys's focus on developer first and like really caring about the developers because yeah like that is true that's what i was doing like whenever i would like start building an application with on on the blockchain i would like whip up a backend i would be like hey we need to lock these users and when i discover morales i'm like wait that can just all happen at the same time in the same place right um and you guys have a database which is super nice um here's a good question it took me a second to kind of understand it but now i understand it and i think it's pretty good mustafa asks are we super early to jump in web 3 or is it time to learn and build web three so my translation of this is is are we like too early because everybody keeps saying early so he's saying is it like too early where there are not even that many opportunities there so maybe i should wait or is this the right time to actually start learning and building on web3 well of course it's the right time because what's your alternative are you gonna be a normal web developer look you're competing with 30 million you're competing with everyone in the world basically who is also a developer what what are you guys are going to uh you can go into ai and spend seven years learning the deep math of that and which is by the way fantastic but it's also it's overly hyped i remember in 2017 i when i was still doing masters in university machine learning was so hyped i mean uh all of the world's smartest engineers are already in machine learning so look what are you gonna do otherwise web stream i love it because because of the opportunity and because of the unfair advantage because we're still in a in a stage where the mothers don't tell their kids to go into blockchain right because this is when it's too late when you have the average mom telling hey you need to become a webster developer it's too late and guess what now all all mothers are telling their kids go become a doctor or become a developer okay but not a web 3 developer so that's this is the perfect opportunity and i personally i love all industries where people have not been thinking too much uh what do i mean well look at web2 there are maybe you know thousands if you look took every if you spend any time thinking about ideas in web 2 or technologies in web 2 and you just add everyone who has been thinking about web 2 probably is thousands of years humankind have spent thousands and thousands and thousands of years thinking about web 2 if you just put everyone's thinking time after each other yeah and look if you're going to come into web 2 maybe you want to build some kind of thing with react or something some kind of ios app look it's too late whatever idea you had it's probably already discovered and it's tested and there is already a market dominance by someone and there is already a monopoly probably so uh is there is too late but web3 we haven't been thinking a lot there are so so much opportunity and so so much arbitrage basically that you can discover a problem and chances are it's not solved chances are you're one of the first people trying to solve it so i definitely think that it's not too early and the earlier the better because you have more time to establish yourself and it's all about your conviction do you do you think that web3 is needed if yes it cannot be too early if you still don't understand it uh slightly more study more re read read about what it can be and uh and be convinced that and when you're convinced then it's a nobrainer yeah absolutely um yeah i think for me it was it it took me a while to get convinced but i think what got me in initially were like the monkeys and um being able to make money very very quickly and then that's what got me in and then i got i lost a couple of trades i like got rug pulled and then i was like you know what i i really need to learn this and then i actually started enjoying it so i came for the memes but stayed for the test right right that's great and also you know many people they say oh and nfts are so dumb you know nfc's this dumb apes many people that that are more you know veteran crypto so to speak they they complain but i love nfcs because they get us so much adoption people really find them fantastic it's a community i see graffiti i think it was in new york city i saw a lot of graffiti with this board ape so it's i think it has they have given us a lot they've given us so many great people developers like yourself and it's been a good um a good push for many people to get into web3 because before that we had d phi which is decentralized finance lending synthetic assets derivatives but that's too complex for the average joe it's too complex enough people don't know what derivatives are but people know what collectibles are what game assets are so nfc's it's a perfect segue and i think nfcs will give web3 worldwide mass adoption we're still not there but it seems to be the avenue for sure yeah i think um nfts as well as gaming i think i i feel like the future of gaming in in this space is going to be really really massive um i have yet to think about how they're going to integrate start integrating it later into like mainstream games but one of the games that comes to my mind is fifa like fifa would be the perfect because fifa has its own stock market with like five million active users i used to buy cards and see if i have messi or you know cristiano ronaldo or whoever else and i would unpack the cards all the time and then like my brother is always watching the fifa stock like which players values going up and down there's millions of trades going on in any given second and so i'm like i feel like if if the blockchain were to figure out its way into something like fifa you would have like a average kid making forty fifty thousand dollars six thousand dollars a year just playing games at home well that's one another one that i really like are these physical brands like nike for example that now have an opportunity to digitalize themselves for a fifa this may not be the perfect opportunity because they they are already digital they are all they have all of this transaction volume they're always digital but when you look at business opportunities i think for physical brands it's fantastic because imagine if nike they have a shoe and they create an nfc which can be redeemed for this special shoe and now people can trade this nfc between each other and speculate and maybe people will trade it a thousand times before someone actually redeems the shoe and nike can take a cut of all of the transactions and that's very nice business model for someone like a physical brand that wants to now become a digital digital brand and digital fashion so i think nike can 10x their revenue probably by doing some special digital edition they did yeah they launched their project and it sold out you know it was huge uh one of the projects that they heard them and adidas um zephyrine asks i have no professional working experience however i have worked on couple of hackathon projects on web3 having trouble landing my first internship job suggestions well i have many suggestions you need to figure out which projects you want to work with and don't just send them the resume it's too many people send the resume all projects uh and by the way it also applies to morales to to our project or to anyone else they have a community because that's the most important thing in web street that you have a community maybe it's on discord on telegram somewhere else so if i were you i would start being active there let's say that it's some kind of of a product maybe a game or something you can start helping people out maybe there's some bugs you can start fixing them maybe there is some opportunity to contribute to their open source repository you can start doing that so instead of cv be active in the community of course you can also send the cv but there are just so many and cvs will be reviewed by the hr department and they're going to look at it differently compared to if you contribute to the open source repository and you're going to get noticed by a dev or you're going to do something in their community and you're going to get noticed maybe by one of the founders because founders look at the community a lot and you're going to have different people look at you so i i would recommend that be active in the community have a portfolio of course i mean that's a given you need to have a portfolio maybe github maybe something else of projects and if you want to practically build up your portfolio you can go to morales.projects and uh we do this weekly project it's kind of like you have here a clever programmer so you can of course subscribe of course to a clever programmer here you're doing also projects but do do that do that and then maybe adapt them maybe continue building you watch clever programmers then continue building something to put a twist to them or or if you are in various projects do the same so you have a good base and then you you can continue building or and and and making them your own and the step two would be to be active in the communities and i think you you will very quickly find a job this way because i know for myself we've taken a lot of people from our community that we hired and some of the our best hires have been from the community because they already love morality they are already engaged they're already basically working but in their free time so it just makes perfect sense that we start working for real and they become part of the team so community community community be active in the community guys that's the best the best thing and it does it doesn't work like that in web too let's say i want to work in google i mean there is no telegram to go to like okay i know you know i cannot be there in there some kind of discord chat but in web 3 it's all discord i mean and that's because it's so early you know we're still like in discord like figuring out things and maybe this was like uh irc chats in the past oh yeah i wasn't part of that but but we're still early on people ever they what whoever you want to meet in web 3 you you can you can meet them you can meet them in the chat group that's the best thing with web3 yeah absolutely um we're getting really nice questions man there are a ton of questions i um one of the questions that just actually came in i want to address this actually is how long will it take me to learn blockchain tech from scratch so assuming somebody's a complete beginner and they're just about to start learning you know how long does it take for an average person who's maybe maybe a little bit of a developer has some developer experience but they want to learn blockchain how long would you save till they they understand it and use things with it i think it can be in a couple of months and it all depends which niche you want to take because there is no such thing as you know learning blockchain completely it's like learning intro completely there are so many things i can do frontend backend devops i can go into spark cassandra i mean all of the different backend systems it's impossible to know everything so you need to pick your niche if you want to be in front and for example you can check out web3 ui kit on github which is also a project that we're contributing to a lot and that's where you can find a react library which is compatible with your current knowledge and you can very very simply plug and play it into web three so web3 akit if you are a web3 developer if you want to write smart contracts you need to learn hard hat you need to learn solidity and it's going to be a longer journey but i think you need to do that because it will show you how you write your own smart contracts you can program money it shows you how to program money the fact that you can and it's not difficult to start imagine you have you have a java class or python class but you change a few syntax syntax ways of writing different variables and and loops and stuff like that and now you have a solidity program which can accept money it can decide what to do with money so learn solidity and you're gonna use solids together with hard hat so hard hat is like this dev tool that allows you to deploy contracts and to manage your contracts um absolutely well also by the way before you before you do any of this you need to of course install metamask and figure out how that works and use use the different applications use openc use uni swap you have to be a web 3 user first before you can be a developer i mean that's that's an obvious thing but very easy to miss and an important thing to mention because many people that want to be in web 3 they may not even use web3 yet so maybe spend a few months just using it you need to so for example if i were to give you a list buy an nfc on openc figure it out make a trade with uni swap figure it out go into why earn uh and do some uh stake some assets there and earn some yield uh poke around with this maybe invest in some ico like just just for trying one of these token launches it's not even called ico nowadays it's called the launch pads so you can go to launchpad just you know try it out put in 50 bucks see what happens so you understand how to claim tokens how to stake tokens how to participate in all of these different operations that people do in web3 like for example launch pass when you when you tokens launch of course don't put any serious money into this because you don't know anything you're probably going to lose it because of the many ways you can also lose funds in this industry that's how i got it that's how i got it yeah you're gonna lose more by not trying you're gonna lose more in opportunity cost by being on the sidelines so best you lose you know you let's say you get drug pulled which is a way of uh as a way of saying that you've been scammed uh let's say you get dragged okay lose 100 bucks you maybe you lose a whole career if you don't try it so uh exactly that's a good one you lose more money by not trying it that's very true yeah that's golden man that is uh that's a golden one that's exactly what i thought i said i thought man i'll lose much more if i don't try and i went in with the money that i was willing to lose because how do i expect to win i'm brand new to it you know it's like going to tennis for your first time and just going i'm gonna crush everybody no you're not you're gonna lose you're gonna get destroyed like i came back from jiu jitsu today and i i'm like relatively new to it everybody just smashes me and i'm just like tapping out you know it doesn't matter who they are they're like choking me out so i expect to lose i'm like that with the whole world of crypto i jumped in expecting to lose but i love all the strategies that you were giving at the end which is like buy an nft you know even if it's like ten dollars like some it can be the smallest cheapest nfts you guys can buy actually make a trade and you'll end up learning so much i learned way more by actually doing things then like any blog article that i read because i understood oh there's like eth and then there's weath which is wrap teeth and you can convert it like this and yes i need to use uniswap and i was trying to do some really degen stuff and like my friend was showing me slippage and all this crazy stuff and exactly but you don't have to get too deep just just build a wallet so you you get a metamask wallet you get some heath into it uh so you fund it with some heath then you do some trades with nfts with uni swap and uh do maybe spend maybe a few days doing that then you can start developing so you can go to morales you can go to docs.morales. and then you will start learning how to build a dashboard for your wallet so basically the next step is just build a website in react where you can connect your wallet and where your website can then show you all of the things you've done so you can show this one so you can build then you can build yourself a website that shows okay you have this many if you have this many tokens this many nfts then you hear all your transactions because then you you can start you know you start feeling ah man this is actually programmable stuff you know i can connect yeah i really like that i want to actually build that for myself because i hate opening metamask i think their ui is like terrible um phantom has an amazing ui but like metamask ui like yeah so i would want to build something of my own that shows how i'm using the money the trend that dude that's actually a great idea so next in the roadmap is that you can create your own coin so after you've done this that you've just interacted with a bunch of stuff you can use morales to build the dashboard next you can launch your own coin using uh solidity and hard hat and you don't even need to know solidity because there are templates so you can go to open zeppelin which is a website with all a bunch of different smart contract templates and when you want to launch a coin you basically deploy a smart contract you deploy a a small program which is like a java class you can think about it but it's solidity solidity class but instantly it's not called class it's called smart it's called contract and you deploy it and you just say hey this this coin it has a million coins in circulation and you give them all to your wallet and then you can send it to the different other wallets so that way you've also now deployed something on chain you've deployed an asset on chain you've you've done something you know you've you've started programming money it's not only that you program where you read from your wallet which was the dashboard step now you've actually deployed your own asset you're programming on the blockchain now and yeah i mean then sky is the limit look at that point you will you will know enough to figure out the rest yourself because you know at some point you reach some escape velocity and you know how to research on your own then you kind of know you know oh i want to learn about lending or oh i want to learn about more nft more nfc related technologies so when you reach that escape velocity you will understand on your own where to go which tutorials to watch you will become independent i love that um this question looks pretty good so i'll pop that up here hamza asks do we need to have previous software engineer experience to excel in web3 or starting in web3 and sticking into it will also help us excel as some big web 3 companies like consensus want that experience well i think if you are completely new it's like with all programming it's better if you have programming experience than not have of course so you just know that you will probably have to learn the basics first probably it's better to learn javascript first before going into web three or so literacy is because in javascript you have big community a lot of books tutorials courses so i would say before going into web3 learn javascript and learn you know normal programming because it's all needed anyway in web3 you are learning web3 by learning javascript and then you can enter afterwards and you know if some big webs like someone like consensus will hire you uh i don't know if that's the it's like entering you know web 2 and asking will google hi i don't know man probably there are way more opportunities for you to do something on your own or or do something else than to aim for google instantly because it's not even for everyone but and even if it is it's uh basically no consensus they do mathematics so it's like it will matamus hire you i don't know maybe in a few years if you work hard yeah no i agree i agree um yeah these are these companies are kind think of it like the google of tomorrow and uh you know the facebooks of tomorrow these are like the big companies that are growing you have you have more chances of honestly joining one of these than like say google because they have like standardized their way of testing and they're so rigorous right now with web3 what i've noticed opportunity is insane um and a lot of people and companies just want talent that's willing to even show that they're willing to learn because everybody's new like most people honestly have months of freaking experience um and i know founders that are hiring them you know including myself and so i think as long as you have your heart and passion in there you can definitely jump in and it's a very practical um thing for you so you know going going on the whole thing of you're like okay learn solidity learn these learn these technologies and then you can start building stuff you know then what like so i i i learn stuff i can build stuff with this then what do i just start applying to jobs or do you do you stand by your way of i go into communities and just start adding a ton of value there as a developer well i mean it depends who you are as a person if you are more entrepreneurial you could see a problem in the industry and it can be many different problems so for example it can be that you come from a country and you see oh there's no like reporting tax tool for your country or it may be oh i see this use case with defy but there are no good wallets for it maybe let's create a wallet or you see some other thing like there is a coin but it's not easy to to take it cross chain maybe you can build a bridge and in all of these different uh different use cases there are of course ways to monetize it whether it is that you have some kind of fee or you have some kind of token that you can monetize through it's you really going to figure it out yourself as you go along but at the end of the day it depends who you are maybe you want to join a company like a consensus or something else maybe you want to join a traditional maybe you see that hey you have a big company that is web 2 and now they're going into web 3 and you can help them a lot because you you are now one of the top experts in the world because you've studied for two months [Laughter] when you start getting into this you will see more and more opportunities popping up it's kind of like you know you and i we're thinking about the medical field we're like so okay i learned medicine and then what i'm a doctor i am like you know local hospital that that's that's my limit but of course not there are probably like many different different ways that you can excel but before you start entering into this into space you you won't notice them so start start doing and then and invest your time because it will be worth it at the end of the there's nothing else you can spend your time on right now that will be as worth it as web 3. right exactly and a lot of it is about timing right right now doctors might not be exploding but like when the world war ii was going on i mean holy the opportunity to become a medical or doctor was probably exploding right it's like that matters um gregory horn has a really good one and ivan by the way whenever you have to leave just let me know it's all good but i just feel like we got a good energy going good questions coming through so i'm gonna keep going on my own gregory says asks is it preferable to develop a dap that runs on a web 2 traditional domain or a web 3 blockchain domain as part of a portfolio well you can do both you can show that you know how to do web 2 and web 3 because it's it doesn't you can have both but of course most dapps they are still in web 2 domains although you can of course use ens or you can use unstoppable domains or other protocols and now there is also a handshake i think is another one but none of them are really you know massive and you can definitely do both in most cases that you have a web 2 version and then you can upload it on ipfs and connect an ens domain for example yeah absolutely that's amazing um that's a that's a great way to answer that question people are really enjoying that we're both on here they're like yo ivan is ivan and kazi on the same stream let's go this is sick we'll definitely want to have you on here more um there are many critics about nfts that are ponzi scheme and web 3's a hype any thoughts on these i know kind of what your thoughts are um yeah and i know generally kind of what people's consensus are i don't know if you want to expound on this at all well yeah i mean i can i can speak for hours about this well first and foremost ponzi scheme people don't know what it means when they even say it i mean what is a ponzi scheme ponzi scheme is i take money from you i promise you a big return and then i i promise the same return to the other guy and then i take his money and give to you as your return and then i find the third guy and i give his money to the second guy and you know that that's a ponzi scheme all right nfts is just like any other market where people buy and sell things there's no promise of return there's no one that takes your money and says hey you give it to me i promise you that that would be a ponzi scheme nfcs are just assets that people trade with any assets whether it is real estate stocks nfts you can have a market where the prices are irrational they go up into in the skies and people become greasy and there's a lot of speculation which means that yes we may have a crash and people that bought at the top will lose money and people that sold at the top of the market will will earn money so it's just natural and look whenever there is a new technology it always creates these bubbles if you look back when trains were a new thing you go you can google this if you're watching this stream go google railway mania you will you will find that in 1800 or something like that 1800 in britain there was a new railway company starting each month why because railways people thought man trains you know railway it's crazy we can transport things across continents let's build companies less invest less great things using trains well of course it became a railway mania and how many railway companies you have now per country one maybe two so it consolidated the same thing with cars go and watch how many car manufacturers there were at the beginning of the of the previous century hundreds and hundreds now everyone was starting a car company let's build cars it's a new technology it was hyped you know people were doing cars left and right and and it was a hype it consolidated now maybe then you have mercedes you have audi you have a few others uh the same thing with internet early on everyone says let's do a dot com this dot com that people were following in there was a financial bubble and and then it's consolidated so probably something is going to be with nft most of this project is going to die a few of them are going to be successful and it's it's always like that when a new technology comes that is great it's going to create the hype is going to create a bubble people going to earn money people are going to lose money that are speculating but people who build and actually do something in this industry they are the guaranteed winners absolutely um yeah i think like building you can't go wrong with building because even if you like let's say lose financially in the short term you're gaining so much experience actually build something greater in the future so i feel like with building you can rarely go wrong at the very least you've developed your skill set and now you can go work for a company right so that's the big thing about building this is a really good question we have a senior developer in the house and he asks is moving to blockchain solidity a good idea for somebody with 13 years of experience with java node.js and archetype architect experience as well and how much salary on average can be expected considering person is already on good salary well i mean you can definitely expect very very competitive salaries i mean we're seeing everything from 200k to you know 300 and above in in some cases depending on your level of seniority because you have to understand smart contracts if you deal with hundreds of millions of dollars which if you are good you will you will be doing that i mean your code will be guarding hundreds of sometimes billions of dollars in this industry uh so of course when you're dealing where you do when you're dealing with that and uh i mean we also have many hacks you can just google recently we had the 600 million dollar hack you can google run in the network hack it was last week 600 million was stolen uh but uh this is the kind of things that you're you're doing in this space i mean you're programming money you're programming money so of course it it it can go it can it can vary a lot but if you're really successful and you know what you're doing then the sky's the limit and uh you should definitely start starting solidity juice if you are if you are but it depends on you on who you are of course if you're hungry you know you're hungry for success you're hungry for new adventures you're hungry for new uh new horizons then it's a nobrainer if you want to be a java developer with a good salary and feel comfortable then don't do it if you want to be in new horizons and explore new things and and take on a new industry then it's a nobrainer of course but yeah i don't want to say that everyone should do it because there are different situations look if you have family and kids you want to be very safe stick with your java and where you are right now if you are a bit more risky you know you want to try the solidity thing maybe work in a few protocols maybe it works out or it doesn't work out uh then absolutely it's a you should do it you should do it yep and as you were talking i don't know if you saw but i was just highlighting job opportunities and yep and you got your averages so these are averages on the left middle is the minimum and then these are some of the maxes you know um on the on the really really high end so you guys can go to web3.com yeah i i think i think that one is good for but i think the the what they got wrong in that list is the highest because uh once again i mean a lot of these devs they they guard hundreds of millions i think when it comes to the highest it's it's got to be higher than that i mean in many cases yeah i saw i saw some that were 600 000 to 750 000 as well um and uh you know you i think you know alex becker too in the field right i mean at least watch his videos and stuff and his developer who helped him launch neo tokyo i think cleared over a million millions of dollars you know working with them yeah so you have those rare right because a lot of companies what they're doing is they're giving a percentage as well of like the token or whatever exactly and and i think in many cases if you are a very good solution developer i mean very very good release developer uh but i would do that i would go into some kind of project that is doing some kind of nfc or some kind of asset and i would instead of having a big salary i would instead go for tokens yeah i love that yeah basically you're almost getting equity in those in the company that you're that you're with you know and i love the idea of tokens because i think when will morales release its tokens do you guys have something like that well we it could be on the roadmap nothing is decided yet but you know before we do it we want to be we want to be fully established you know we want to be already massive we don't want to do a token you know and then we're going to do things which unfortunately what most people do we want to do a token when when we have already changed the world to such an extent that our token is already the number one on uh on the number one page on coin market cap easily we don't want to be you know on some you know page ten coin market so for us we we're delivering first we're delivering first and uh and then what happens happens here wow i love that i will tell you one thing um this is something rare but i i look for a lot of qualitative feedback regarding people's products and services and things like that morales has really good qualitative feedback that i've been seeing around like you know i'm not even trying to push this down anybody's throats i'm not even like mentioning it's like from people in the community youtube videos even videos where we weren't doing morales like there will be a comment here and they're talking about hey can we use morales and i really like it so that's big man that's big to do that that's good here that's good to hear that's good to you yeah you guys should i mean you guys should be very proud of yourselves and i think you guys are building something phenomenal um really makes developers jobs easier so that's amazing um ivan do you have any more thoughts or anything more that you want to add oh by the way guys that was the april fool's joke i'm not deleting the channel um [Laughter] yeah i i shot i shot off twitter because you know i accidentally started to retweet some stuff which were like they kind of sounded true but then i realized man i've been retweeting the jokes like i've been there was a guy who said i'm starting my i started my first day at google today but you know goodbye web3 i was like whoa fantastic you know still good you know it's google [Laughter] and then i was like wait wait wait yeah then i i deleted everything shut the shot off twitter until tomorrow oh man um yeah i big bill i see what you said senior backend developer has paid more than junior blockchain developers are switchworthy um i don't know you decide man you decide i think that you could go into job opportunities that have back end involvement plus they want you to do blockchain and they might be willing to pay you a decent amount to be able to do that because like it's not it's not like all of a sudden web 2 is just vanished you know what i mean like um you still need web 2. um like if you don't have your web 2 wifi your web 3 won't work exactly that's true and you know i mean at that it all depends on the person yeah if let's say like you say if you're a backend developer and you can slowly nudge yourself towards web3 maybe let's say you're a backend developer and you're in a big company maybe you can just start pushing for web 3 projects because i assure you that all corporations they want to be in web 3 they want to be in in metawars they want to because for them it's important because they're investors the the shareholders this the stock price may may demand that that hey why are we not expanding why are we not exploring we're gonna be dinosaurs and if you then can start you know nudging yourself you're not taking too big of a risk maybe you you're in a big corporation you're starting to move more towards web three maybe you can establish a website department you can be the webster guru evangelist in your company i mean that alone can 5x your salary probably probably if you show that you're like the best expert they've got on this probably you can 5x your salary yeah there was a great question that came in earlier that i didn't ask earlier but i'll ask now um somebody asked um what kind of potato are you using for your camera ivan that's a good one so actually yeah i i i have a new lens a new lens that should do my background very blurry and uh and very nice but it's it's too much blur and i still haven't figured out you know which you know how how we should and look i'm so bad with cameras you know i i i think you just click on it but yeah at least you can hear me you can use it as audio yeah i think i think it's just your wifi is down i i think your camera or maybe wifi yeah i think it's just your wifi is making it look like that um yeah yeah cool this is doobie had a followup who you know the senior blockchain no not the senior blockchain engineer but just senior developer it seems like who wanted uh blockchain uh info and he's like i'm doing a ton of udemy courses are there accredited certifications which have value in the industry helpful in getting a job like a blockchain council or something no no um it could be if you are uh applying to two jobs in the web too like let's say you want to web blockchain ibm or something they may care about these things if you if you work in west groves and you build this it's uh yeah you you're not gonna need it uh this certifications they're mainly for uh corporations uh they're mainly that you can say that you you have it and corporations can say you know we've educated because imagine i'm a middle manager in a preparation i want to show that i've pushed my my team into web three so maybe i'll buy them some certificate just to just to say okay guys now we're certified uh and uh so that's mainly what i'm seeing that it's it's a lot for uh corporate use case that they want to upskill their workforce and get them into into blockchain but practically it's it's not really needed if you work in this industry and it probably as this industry matures they're going to be more and more needed but right now i i rarely see that it's some kind of decisive factor whether you have some certification or not instead is your portfolio are you active in communities do you know the protocols do you know how this industry works that's way more important yeah i i agree with you on that i think it's like on the blockchain you just build things that you can show them literally on the blockchain be like here's what i've built and as long as you can go in with what you've built i think that's going to speak way more volume than uh a piece of paper would at least in this industry and i love that answer like web 2 companies would probably care but other companies wouldn't care that much yeah nice i like that you caught that my camera my my camera is potatoing it's all good it's all good this is a good question i think because you know going off of okay we want to make a hundred thousand dollars a year as a blockchain developer what are the steps what are the processes so this question goes along with that theme really well ubang asks so what is the right way of learning web3 and smart contracts in that case hey look at that dude yeah there you go and and another option another angle well the right way to learn about three smart contracts is is by doing is by doing so maybe you can watch a few tutorials just just uh search web three tutorials soliz tutorial you can go to morales academy we have a bunch of courses and tutorials there as well and there we can also we give you a counselor basically someone that will help you and guide you if you want more personal approach like that go to morales academy but as soon as you got the basics you know you kind of know how to do a smart contract you kind of know the basics like the bare basics then you need to build things so here's where you can watch clever programmer the builds or morales projects if you go to mariah's ios projects because that will give you the practical context that you need because without the practical context you're just gonna get stuck in the tutorial hell you're gonna watch videos and you know read some articles uh read you're gonna read twitter threads you're never gonna actually have the practical context so all in all uh learn uh some simple solidity you can find a lot on youtube or morales academy then um you can learn some simple uh web3 and react you can use web3ui kit and also again as soon as you feel that you kind of you can kind of do something with it build full projects build full projects so that's what what i would do i love that and what is a full project well for example what you guys are doing on the channel like web3 twitter amazon i mean that's that's that's a good example or like we're doing on our channel at morales channel uh we'll do similar things and we also do game game engine integrations like for example if you want to do a unity game and you want to connect it with the blockchain we have a perfect course on that coming out on saturday to saturday for example so basically use cases finished use cases where you go from zero to done a use case can be that you build a dashboard for your wallet like i said maybe it's the simplest one then another use case can be that you launch a token and now you can have a dashboard for your wallet and your token where you can issue new coins you can transfer them you can you can do different things with your coin maybe stake them maybe burn them uh just very simple stuff that i'm thinking on the fly maybe next thing you have is that if you deposit one eth you get a token so you basically can build a as a token cell yes it's just just to this experiment you can have a smart contract a program on the blockchain which receives one if and for each if it receives it sends you 10 tokens very simple thing next thing you can integrate with chain chain link maybe chain link is is next big frontier because when you integrate with chain link now you can have look if there is there is a frost if it's a minus degrees outside uh we paid the money if it's plus or yeah in fahrenheit or something else but look if it's cold outside we don't pay you if it's warm outside we pay you you can have real real world data into the blockchain this is of course important for insurance let's say that you have crops they're gonna die if it's too cold it would be nice if it was an automated smart contract that paid you instantly when it's too cold for example so you can start in you can start buying real apis from web 2 into the conditions that decide what happens to your to the funds in your smart contracts so yeah i mean some very simple stuff and then you will figure out and look you guys ask so many questions you know or should i do this or just just do something you know you're gonna be analyzing you you gotta be asking and analyzing just do it you know stop asking me questions you just start building and start thinking stop thinking because it's the same with in normal programming people ask me hey ivan should i do python or java or javascript i heard python is good for machine learning java is good for this corporate stuff javascript is good for web i'm you know i don't know what to choose there's also haskell and rust and a month later they still haven't decided they're still analyzing you know is it good salary and job man just just do it's not just star [Laughter] i love that yeah uh guys yeah seriously jump in i i love that i think you'll find out a lot of these answers by just jumping in um so that's good dude i had i had a random thought while you were talking i was like what if you like could you build something like where um i was just thinking of doing this literally with my friends where they could bet on youtube creators like how many views their next video is going to get and if that video gets that many views in the next three days to automatically get the money ah that's nice that's nice exactly exactly that's the perfect one for for uh uh for chain link that you can connect youtube api to your smart contract and let me tell you another thing you can have a lossless bet what do you mean by that let's say that you and i we bet on some outcome so you put in a thousand bucks i put in a thousand bucks and then we can put it into something like compound protocol we send it into a smart contract it starts earning interest so this money we put in you know in a week it may be not a 2 000 bucks that we put in collectively maybe it's now 200. or i don't know the exact interest rates now but you can basically create a lossless lottery or a lossless bet where we only compete for the interest that we both generated so let's say you put in money i put in money we generate interest whoever wins gets the interest that we collectively generated the rest gets refunded to uh to to both i mean that's that would be impossible without web3 you cannot do something like this where you can earn interest like per second you know you earn interest per second in a bank you earn it you it's not like it's not real time so that is a sick idea that is so let me tell you another one another thing that is not possible uh without web3 that really bends your mind it's a flash loans where you can take millions of dollars you can right now if you know simple programming you can get 10 million dollars in your wallet with one condition you have to repay it in the same transaction so you get 10 million bucks if you don't repay it the whole transaction is just aborted it's reversed so you lose the funds but what does it mean it means that you can now funnel this money through smart contracts as long as you return it back in the same transaction it's all legit this means that let's say that i see an arbitrage opportunity i see that this coin is trading for one dollar on this exchange but it's trading for 0.9 dollars on that exchange so i can take 10 million bucks i can buy it for 0.9 i sell for one dollar i return the loan it's it's all in the same transaction it's all in the same transaction and i keep the profit so this flash loan concept you should really look into if you if you're interested in the new financial primitives we call financial primitives basically this is this basic financial operations that you can do in web 3 using smart contracts that you cannot do anywhere else uh and flashlights is a good example whatever arbitrage you see you can act on it with endless capital basically through this concept of flashlights damn that is so cool so flash loans makes sure that that transaction you're about to do it verifiably gives all the money back and if it doesn't it doesn't even fire off exactly just gets you so i mean okay so you can't um in simple words like i can't it up right like there's no way i can like just lose 10 million dollars like guarantee that if i borrow it it's gonna get back the the only thing you will lose is the transaction fee so all if he's a transaction transactions on ethereum need to pay fees but that's like any other transaction so the only thing you risk is the transaction fee because that you're going to pay either or even if transaction gets reverted and basically this loan fails so how do you how do you go through different exchanges and you know what i'm talking about give me one second i think she wants to go outside my bulldog yeah yeah sure sure yeah guys so for all you watching we're gonna get back soon there you go dog evacuated yeah so uh the way it works kind of like a promises in javascript you can do different things you can do you know do this request then take the response do that request and you can chain promises after each other and just funnel them you know one two one to the next and next and next and next the same is with the solid so you can say hey take the funds from here put it in this program okay take the output put it in that program take the output put it in that and you know if at the end of the day you have a profit because let's say you used an arbitrage you you bought some coin in here for 0.9 then you saw another place another program you could sell for one dollar you have a profit you return the loan perfect and by the way this is uh it's also a bigger topic because uh let's say that you you are smart and you see such an opportunity in the real world where you say hey wait there there are some assets trading cheap here and expensive there maybe on some stock exchanges or something else you cannot act on this opportunity without capital you cannot act on arbitrage without capital but now in web 3 everyone has endless capital to act on this arbitrage opportunities which in turn create efficient markets but that's a more economical topic but it's very interesting that's an amazing one have you messed around with it personally yeah yeah you can go to other let me see if they still have it in the docs docs our flashlight so you did a loan and you made like some profit i mean even if you lost money or something like that but you made yeah some money on it no no i i haven't done any money on it and by the way it's not it's not easy to do money on it because it would be easy everyone would do it so it's not easy to do it you really have to spend a lot of money finding this and because anyone can do it it also means that everyone does it all the time i mean that's why because the opportunity is open for all it's uh it means that it's very difficult to find a way in but you should research a recent example where somebody used it in a very smart way basically if you held if you held a board ape you know that you got eight ape coins and so some guy he did not have money for to buy an ape because an ape cost like 200k he got a flash loan he got he bought the nfts in one transaction so he gets flashlights like millions of dollars he buys the nfts he gets the airdrop token which is like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars he sells the nfts he returns the loan and he keeps the airdrop you can google it uh ape let me see if i can find it that's gene flash flashlight so exactly so just google it let's bring it up house just google apecoin flashlight so that's an example where look if you have brains you have now a tool with endless capital with endless capital to to act on those opportunities is it gonna be easy no this is not free money you have to be smart but you know that if you find a way where you need a lot of cash to buy something maybe to claim some airdrop like this guy he he didn't have money to buy eight it's a hundred of thousands of dollars to buy that eight ft but yeah you take penis of those flashlights you buy the ape you get the airdrop you sell the ape you return the loan you keep the airdrop jeez it included five this falls generated on the okay wow he bought a bunch of apes huh he bought a bunch of apes claimed the airdrop sold the apes returned they then sold these tokens on the decentral exchange for 398 after this sold so with flash loans does all of this need to happen in a matter of like one second or can this happen over like so this needs to happen in one transaction yes but like that one transaction like but what i'm not understanding is how could you possibly do this so it's like is that one transaction happening over a period of seconds in real life or is that happening over like no no no you could take a week to make that transaction happen no no it needs to be in one transaction meaning that it's it basically needs to all happen uh in in the sequence basically when so how does the blockchain work you have blocks of transactions so on ethereum each 10 or 15 seconds a bunch of transactions get executed on the blockchain and so your transaction needs to be structured in a way where the version when the ethereum virtual machine executes it this all needs to uh this ultimate all needs to check out in uh when it does it at the same time so it's not like over weeks it needs to do it at the same time got it and uh each each uh each transaction has a certain gas limit so basically it means that each transaction you can say how much you're willing to pay for it and that will depend on how how many computational steps it has to do so there is a limit how much you can do you cannot you know you cannot have an infinite loop in a transaction that because you will run out of gas but yeah you could you could tell it hey you know go into this smart contract send money there take money from there and send it there and if it doesn't check out at the end let's say that you cannot return the flashlight the whole transaction is just invalidated it gets thrown out can i if it does check out yeah i was just gonna say can i do flash can you do flashlights on the devnet uh let's see because that's like so scary right like if the only place you could execute this is on the main net so by the way uh google how do flash loans let me send you a video because we've actually done it i think on a test net on avalanche which is like ethereum so if you go to uh youtube and you search d5 flash loans 2022 i think you'll find our video because we did it with one of our instructors danielle so google d5 flash loans 2022 uhhuh there you go there we go flash loan course that one that one click on that one flashlight so this is on our channel is that danielle he's fantastic he's done this basically he where you execute and it's one hour long course on flashlights where you you have this app where you can try it and then he explains to you he uses ave and he does it on the avalanche test net where i think they have this capabilities yeah oh this is your house dude does he have a the code for me oh wow look at how nice he is what a nice guy got it you know i always when i was new i always thought this dot sol meant it was like dot soul but then i learned it's solidity i thought i was like wait i'm like everybody's developing solana huh interesting exactly oh okay wow but yeah here you can you can see her how it is damn so with so with smart contracts you and i we can publish programs on the blockchain and that program can be that hey you know take the flash loan do this do that it's like javascript now with promises you but with javascript promises is mainly requests you know you say go to this api then take the data go to that one and you chain them in a smart contract you can do the same thing but with funds you can say you know put in that one take take out you know mom and then you can do a transaction that calls that calls that smart contract and then it's going to execute it yeah no somebody says so the blockchain technology is all about trading no it's not all about trading it's just one aspect of it that he was showing we were talking specifically about flash loans so flash loans there's a lot of like trading arbitrage that you could pull off with flash loans so that is where we were talking about trades but a blockchain technology you could use it for a lot of things like for example you know where people are sending money to ukraine to fight off the russian war and that's the easy way for ukraine to collect money because i don't know how else i would send it but like with crypto it's super easy for me to send it and they can get it right away and so they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars because people are able to like i donated and usually i never donate anywhere just because it's like inconvenient but like here i was just going and it was so easy and simple and my wallet like i went to the website and my wallet just got connected and like i pressed one button i'm like yo this was super nice and and when you tried that i mean you that's where you see the light when you see your wallet being connected to all the different websites and you can start you're logged in instantly everywhere you can start interacting with all apps with your identity which is your wallet that's so amazing and this it's really when you see that you see that's how finance should have been on the internet that's minus on the internet that's that's how it will be i think i think the only things that that scare me that i don't understand how they would work is like some of it is so when i think of blockchain you know some of it makes me laugh because i'm like it's not crud anymore it's just cra cr because you can create and read but you can't update or delete so some of the things that confuse me are like okay if on instagram i make a post and then i'm like hey that was stupid let me go and delete that yeah yeah yeah you know and well that's why you don't use blockchain for that i mean blockchain is it's not uh it's not for everything that is something that you probably should not put on the blockchain but blockchain is for value that's i mean that's why in a way it's it's it's kind of connected to the financial space a lot because it's value it's value online you have value you have assets you have nfcs you have tokens you can trade them you can stake them and then you can connect them to other nonfinancial experiences like games for example like for example instagram you can have that if you uh if you get a lot of likes you you have some kind of membership coin generated or nfc generated or if you let's say that you are a music creator and a lot of people listen on your song on spotify you get a revenue share in real time so all of this value and ownership so blockchain is for value and ownership transactions and value and ownership programming which of course includes a bunch of trading because you can trade that but also includes you know how you store it you can for example say you know this this money we have here if you sign if you sign a transaction you cannot send you alone cannot spend it we need to be together to spend it maybe if we have a company together or maybe if we're five people we can say three of us need to accept the transfer uh three or five for example you accept transfer so that's why i think many people confuse it that you know everything should be on chain and you know and then they see but world of warcraft cannot run on chains so it's like if you guys so say you get two say you get two or three developer buddies and you guys are like hey we want to invest in courses and like learn about blockchain you could make this like dow type of thing with three of you where only all three of you have to agree to decide on buying a course that's like 10 bucks 20 bucks or whatever you know what i mean that's like fun that's like your 100 budget for learning blockchain or 200 budget for learning blockchain and you guys can all decide is that at a like persontoperson level you could use it that way or if you're founders of companies you guys could use it as like two founders deciding on a decision and um it's beautiful because it's trust less and so it it doesn't require trust like it's just guaranteed it needs to happen like that um i think some people were asking flash loan specific questions so tambo is like what is the maximum time for holding that flash loan it's not about time so there's no don't think about time because you you have a transaction i guess i guess like one thing i guess one thing that's like blowing blowing my mind my i'm having trouble wrapping my mind around is like how do you purchase like eight apes and then like go to unit swap and then sell them and then keep the airdrops like when that's happening in one transaction i'm thinking it's once one well it's very easy it's very i mean just think about a normal program so the computer executes a program the computer knows the state of the different data structures so for example the computer knows that okay these people have apes they and these people want to sell apes these people have apecoin and they give a coin if you have ape okay so then this guy comes and it's just you know a program that says okay uh send take money from the flash loan then buy buy ape with it it's it's just like imagine all of this was just data structures in your yeah and yeah and you can just change them and you know once you finish it you end up with a final state which is okay uh you have you have you got the edge from this guy because he gave you it because you have you had the ape which you got from the flashlight and the flashlight you got from these guys that give you a flashlight if you return it at the end of this execution which you now by the way can do because you have a profit and you can now return to these guys so this whole thing checks out it's accepted it's stamped put on the blockchain and the final state is that okay that their eight coins are now in your wallet the guy with a flashlight got his flashlight back because you return his funds and um the a the ape whoever sold you their ape they're happy because now they got the funds from the you know from your sales so it all checks out everyone's happy perfect so don't think about time because i i i don't know if that even makes sense to think about time because only here we have a block maybe with a thousand transactions i don't know how many it is in the block maybe a thousand and they all just get executed at the same time and uh so think about it with more as um as uh executions and uh they all happen at the same time then you wait 10 seconds the new block comes all of them are executed at the same time so there's no like don't think of it as time or something yet got it okay okay that makes sense i understand okay beautiful um wow so i think yeah people are enjoying this oh goron is here is this the same goron that i know i don't know maybe it's a different goron but we love you too goron so that's what's important um beautiful so i think we covered a lot man i mean people are still asking a ton of questions and somebody even asked like it seems like morales has all the tools like what what so what is the full stack on blockchain because they're like pretty much every tool they want to look up morales has so you know i guess what in that case if you have tools like morales what is the full stack on the blockchain well morales is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you but for example you still need to uh you still need to do the solidity code yourself and program the smart contracts on your own so that's that's still needed so smart contracts are needed even with morales and i think if you google so you need to google d5 sorry web 3 tech stack let's see if if you go to youtube
