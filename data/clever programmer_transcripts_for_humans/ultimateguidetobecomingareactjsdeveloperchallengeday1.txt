19:29 - successful front and developer to
19:31 - provide for my daughter
19:32 - carl says this was a transformative
19:34 - experience i
19:36 - did it and absolutely amazing
19:39 - i went over the prizes with you guys and
19:41 - these were the winners from our last
19:43 - uh the first challenge we did actually
19:44 - this year so jessica won first place and
19:47 - then
19:47 - we had second and third place that went
19:49 - out
19:50 - now what i do want to let you guys know
19:53 - is after these five days are over
19:55 - we are going to be opening the doors to
19:57 - our
19:58 - uh flagship course called profit with
20:01 - javascript
20:03 - it's literally one of the best course
20:05 - says on the planet when it comes to
20:08 - learning javascript learning react and
20:11 - then using that to be able to get a job
20:14 - exactly guys it's it's completely
20:16 - value-packed and before you guys even
20:18 - ask because we always get this question
20:20 - is it for beginners guys yes you can go
20:22 - from absolutely
20:24 - zero experience all the way up until
20:27 - landing your clients and we actually
20:28 - hold your hand the entire way
20:30 - and we have loads of examples like dina
20:33 - let's talk about dina kazi
20:34 - so dina had actually lost her job due to
20:37 - covid
20:38 - and here is dina right she lost her job
20:41 - due to kovitt
20:42 - she's a mother who wants to learn coding
20:45 - so she can actually help provide for her
20:47 - daughter
20:48 - she joined the five day javascript
20:50 - developer challenge last month
20:52 - and here's her results four weeks since
20:55 - joining this five-day javascript
20:56 - challenge
20:58 - right she ended up winning this
21:00 - competition over
21:02 - here which is like at the impact
21:03 - foundation for women in tech in
21:05 - macedonia
21:06 - she came third in the last five day
21:08 - developer challenge
21:10 - she led a talk in the conference and she
21:12 - came
21:13 - first a week after she won in a coding
21:15 - hackathon
21:16 - and she landed her first javascript
21:19 - developer job
21:21 - literally that same month and just to
21:24 - add the cherry on the top
21:25 - she's now a lead developer guys oh yeah
21:37 - um so yeah guys a lot of people you see
21:39 - constantly they're losing their jobs but
21:41 - they're still able to make an income the
21:43 - same thing
21:44 - happened with you know he jose reached
21:46 - out to us and he was like hey i lost my
21:48 - job in january february
21:50 - and then i started learning how to code
21:53 - and now this experience has shown him
21:56 - that having one source of income is a
21:57 - bad idea so now look he's looking to
21:59 - turn this entire negative into a
22:01 - positive so let me ask you
22:03 - this entire situation that's happening
22:04 - in the world right now
22:06 - is this a situation that is a crisis
22:10 - a problem or is it an opportunity
22:13 - and let me ask you a better question are
22:14 - you willing to turn it into an
22:16 - opportunity because
22:17 - at the end of the day if you decide not
22:18 - to do anything with it nothing will
22:20 - actually happen with it
22:21 - right at the end of the day it really
22:23 - just comes down to you
22:25 - so what's going to be your decision and
22:27 - kind of you have to just decide and
22:29 - commit to it
22:31 - we can there be there to help you and
22:33 - maybe show you the way
22:35 - but the work that you actually have to
22:37 - put in is hard
22:38 - and that's going to be on you exactly
22:42 - and guys we're not talking 50 we're not
22:44 - talking 60
22:45 - you have to give this your 110 effort
22:48 - if you want to make this actually a true
22:50 - opportunity for yourself
22:53 - so guys just want to say one thing right
22:56 - behind making all this happen we have
22:58 - this amazing team at clever programmer
23:01 - so
23:01 - this is everybody who's behind the
23:03 - scenes that makes all this work so you
23:06 - see sunny over here
23:07 - me nas frankie isabel
23:10 - everybody right these are the people
23:12 - that actually make this happen so if you
23:14 - guys could just show some
23:16 - love for everybody here that would be
23:18 - fantastic if you're watching this on
23:20 - facebook
23:21 - smash that like button if you're
23:22 - watching this on youtube smash that like
23:24 - button just send
23:24 - love and good vibes to the team because
23:27 - it definitely helps everybody get in a
23:29 - better
23:30 - mindset with that said let's continue
23:36 - all right so now yeah let's get it go
23:38 - ahead so great
23:40 - i thought you were muted let's go oh
23:41 - yeah yeah so greg
23:43 - ended up landing a paying client even
23:45 - during this covet craziness inside our
23:47 - profit with javascript course and
23:48 - actually
23:49 - we'll come back to some of these and
23:51 - frank ramos was actually a recent one
23:53 - right that on the live stream it was
23:54 - nuts what happened
23:56 - so frank actually built the spotify
23:59 - clone so if you guys built that with us
24:00 - let us know in the comments
24:01 - but he built the spotify clone right and
24:04 - then
24:04 - he reached out and frank's a dedicated
24:07 - viewer guys frank's ever
24:08 - always in our live streams he's always
24:09 - watching but he reached out to us
24:11 - donated a hundred dollars
24:12 - because he landed a six-figure
24:14 - consulting project
24:16 - for sonos so many of you guys might know
24:18 - who sonos is it's an insane speaker
24:20 - brand a premium speaker brand
24:21 - and now he's working with sonos and
24:23 - what's he doing quasi
24:25 - he's actually building out their radio
24:27 - station product
24:28 - so they are having him use react and
24:31 - react native to actually
24:32 - build it out which is pretty freaking
24:34 - dope so that tells you how much demand
24:36 - there is for these things
24:38 - and how valuable this is for everybody
24:40 - to learn it's kind of crazy that on
24:42 - youtube you have 3 700 concurrent
24:44 - viewers
24:45 - absolutely insane it's insane
24:47 - mind-blowing stuff too here's nasir
24:49 - iqbal who are who's our 14 year old
24:52 - student from pakistan and guys again
24:54 - the reason why we're showing this to you
24:55 - right is to show
24:57 - what is possible because nobody shows
25:00 - this stuff
25:01 - right look at any channel on javascript
25:03 - or react or whatever
25:05 - everybody can teach you technical stuff
25:06 - and that's not hard you guys are looking
25:08 - at our channel we're providing
25:10 - four to six hour long technical bills
25:14 - after build every single day the
25:17 - technical stuff is not
25:18 - hard we want to show you now what's
25:20 - possible because some of you are either
25:22 - developers looking to go to the next
25:24 - level or some of you
25:25 - are beginners looking to get your first
25:27 - job
25:28 - i think it's very important you see what
25:30 - is possible so nasir
25:33 - was on my coaching call and he goes
25:36 - i was talking to him and he's like hey i
25:39 - just
25:40 - got a client and i'm like oh [ __ ] i'm
25:42 - like did you get paid
25:43 - and he goes yeah just last week i
25:46 - cleared fourteen hundred dollars
25:48 - hey let's go damn dude what was crazy
25:52 - was he was almost like not happy about
25:54 - it he was like he wanted more i'm like
25:55 - nasir
25:56 - shut the [ __ ] up i'm like put your head
25:59 - down and do the work you're 14 in
26:01 - pakistan
26:02 - like that is insane and then he starts
26:05 - laughing and he's like
26:07 - oh yeah he goes yeah he he's like you
26:10 - know
26:11 - my dad makes like ten thousand in a
26:13 - whole year so i made like
26:14 - you know his two-month salary in in like
26:17 - a week
26:19 - yeah and he got paid i actually had him
26:21 - i had him inside of my coaching call as
26:23 - well and i remember he was like
26:24 - yeah i've landed a client before and i
26:26 - was like yo what like
26:27 - you i was like what the wait hold up
26:29 - just run me through it
26:31 - it's mind-blowing that was insane and i
26:33 - was like yo represent because i'm from
26:35 - pakistan too
26:36 - you know so i was like nice and he
26:38 - landed a client
26:39 - and he developed an e-commerce website
26:42 - and i remember he was asking me and he
26:44 - was talking to me
26:44 - he was actually using python and django
26:46 - to build it out
26:48 - but the most important thing is that
26:50 - it's possible for you guys
26:52 - it doesn't matter where you are in the
26:53 - world it's possible and you can do this
26:56 - and you can get clients regardless of if
26:58 - you're united states tunisia pakistan
27:01 - ireland it doesn't matter so
27:04 - you know he's like why not so i'm
27:06 - working on an e-commerce project with
27:07 - the client that i'm using django as a
27:09 - back-end and react as a front-end so
27:11 - look at that
27:11 - even with python he's using react right
27:15 - and he's charging him 20 an hour and he
27:17 - was working 10 hours a day
27:19 - and that's how he was able to achieve
27:20 - that goal so now here are the seven
27:23 - really important habits
27:24 - sunny and what are some of these habits
27:26 - and why are they important
27:28 - so guys obviously it's going to take a
27:29 - lot of hard work patience is
27:31 - huge because sometimes when you're
27:33 - debugging you need to give it like a bit
27:35 - a lot of time people give it an hour and
27:37 - they kind of quit no it's not going to
27:39 - cut it if you want to make a real
27:40 - difference you've got to give this your
27:41 - time
27:42 - you you've got to be part of a team
27:44 - doing this stuff by yourself can be
27:45 - difficult
27:46 - and most importantly from these things
27:48 - guys like communication learning taking
27:49 - that initiative is important but
27:51 - honestly just have fun with the process
27:54 - yes and why is that so important quasi
27:56 - if you don't have fun
27:57 - and you get into things like you're
28:00 - trying to
28:01 - just do hard work you're gonna quit
28:03 - you're gonna
28:04 - quit non-stop i see this happen so much
28:07 - even people who are you know they're
28:10 - like so focused on the educational
28:11 - system and they're going for their
28:12 - masters and whatever so they're very
28:14 - disciplined with their work ethic
28:16 - but they don't enjoy it they don't get
28:19 - curious they don't try to learn new
28:20 - things
28:21 - what happens is then even when they get
28:22 - a job they hate it
28:24 - and then they ultimately quit so if
28:27 - there's one thing i can push
28:29 - for me coding always felt like i was
28:33 - playing a video game
28:34 - and it always felt wrong that i was
28:37 - being paid for it
28:38 - i swear to god it felt like i found a
28:40 - way
28:41 - to play video games all day and have so
28:44 - much fun
28:45 - and there was somebody silly enough in
28:48 - their brain to pay me for it
28:51 - that's so true dude i never thought of
28:52 - it like that it's so true
28:54 - yeah because because everyone would be
28:55 - like i just finished a hard day at work
28:57 - and i'll be like well i was just coding
28:58 - all day and i kind of got paid
29:02 - and you got paid a lot you know you
29:04 - probably got paid more than that
29:06 - and so yeah it's like man it's pretty
29:08 - ridiculous that
29:10 - how much fun and excitement you can have
29:13 - while you're coding so if it doesn't
29:15 - feel like that
29:16 - try to make it feel like that that's why
29:18 - i don't sometimes recommend people going
29:19 - to college to learn it because so much
29:21 - is shoved down your throat
29:23 - there's no room for curiosity and when
29:25 - there's no room for curiosity
29:27 - you're very less likely to learn
29:30 - exactly so hard work of course is
29:33 - required
29:34 - patience is required team cooperation
29:36 - communication learning taking initiative
29:38 - but the ones that i want to touch on
29:40 - of course fun make sure that's there
29:43 - learn like non-stop and forever
29:46 - that's going to be one of the keys and
29:48 - then taking initiative
29:50 - yeah and guys and just like you right
29:55 - greg who's one of our students a prophet
29:56 - with javascript who we shared with you
29:58 - earlier who landed clients even during
30:00 - covet
30:01 - um he shows up to these live training
30:04 - calls just like you are here today right
30:06 - so i'm up top and we got
30:08 - greg over here showing up like a
30:10 - champion he's also a third degree black
30:12 - belt
30:13 - in taekwondo i don't know if you knew
30:14 - that that's insane i didn't know that no
30:17 - insane and even when our javascript
30:20 - instructor nas is running his epic
30:22 - training calls with like 25 or 50 plus
30:24 - people i don't know how many people
30:25 - we're getting now
30:26 - pwj calls but greg is showing up still
30:29 - to those so there's nas there's greg so
30:32 - if there's one thing you can take from
30:34 - him is make sure you show up
30:37 - every single day that's how he became
30:38 - the third degree black belt in jiu jitsu
30:41 - that's how he became a surveyor and he
30:43 - started doing like contracting
30:45 - physical labor and work and now he wants
30:47 - to switch to coding
30:48 - doesn't know anything about coding is
30:50 - having a
30:51 - hard time learning it but now he's
30:53 - actually starting to land clients for
30:55 - coding which is
30:56 - crazy insane so at this point you might
30:59 - be wondering
31:01 - who is this guy and who's this other guy
31:06 - yeah all right all right i don't know
31:09 - are you wondering
31:10 - maybe we're just making it up yeah i
31:12 - mean like maybe you guys don't know who
31:13 - we are right
31:14 - yeah so um so at clever
31:18 - programmer we all we hit 767 000
31:20 - subscribers thanks to you guys it's a
31:22 - privilege and an honor to be able to
31:24 - serve you
31:25 - i'm rafikaze that goofy looking guy over
31:28 - there from pakistan
31:30 - um i came here humble beginnings didn't
31:32 - really have anything didn't know a
31:34 - letter of english was like bullied for
31:37 - years
31:38 - um and then i tried to kind of go to
31:40 - high school
31:41 - didn't really fit in and um was much of
31:44 - an outcast but then i kind of discovered
31:46 - coding on my own
31:48 - and just started having fun with it and
31:49 - i thought there must be another way than
31:50 - what my brothers were doing
31:52 - and it just seemed very soul sucking so
31:54 - i wanted to do something on my own i
31:55 - discovered coding and i was like damn
31:58 - coding feels like coding literally feels
32:01 - like having a genie and being able to
32:03 - speak to a genie
32:04 - except that you have unlimited wishes
32:07 - not just three
32:09 - the only catch is you have to learn how
32:12 - to speak to the genie
32:13 - the only catch is you have to actually
32:15 - learn how to use react
32:17 - or python or javascript to speak to it
32:20 - and once you do that you literally have
32:22 - infinite powers
32:23 - it's like creating art but people live
32:26 - in that art
32:27 - so like mark zuckerberg's facebook
32:28 - that's his brain when you log into
32:30 - facebook you're entering his brain
32:33 - so it's kind of like fascinating you can
32:35 - just create your own universes
32:36 - so i went into coding purely for the
32:39 - money because my brother told me you can
32:40 - make a lot of money
32:41 - but then i stayed and just fell
32:44 - absolutely in love with it and i kind of
32:46 - even stopped caring about money just
32:47 - because like it was so
32:48 - phenomenal um then at the age of 21 i
32:51 - figured out how to make over a hundred
32:53 - four thousand dollars a year as a
32:54 - freelance developer
32:57 - i even started to get two developers
32:59 - under me that i hired at some point
33:01 - and i would just be at college like
33:03 - playing pool and i would see this stripe
33:05 - payment like come through on my phone
33:08 - like four or five thousand dollars and i
33:09 - would look at it i'd be like
33:11 - what is this i was like but like it
33:14 - would be
33:15 - you know later i got developers that
33:17 - actually started um helping me out and
33:19 - working
33:20 - so it was really amazing to go from a
33:22 - complete beginner to like learning
33:23 - coding
33:24 - getting jobs and getting people and then
33:26 - at some point i decided to start a
33:28 - youtube channel and we ended up
33:29 - you know teaching over hundreds of
33:30 - thousands of students to code um
33:33 - you know was lucky enough to become a
33:34 - millionaire at 25 and learn a lot a lot
33:36 - of hard lessons and
33:38 - failures and went through a lot of pain
33:39 - throughout the way and hopefully just
33:41 - hopefully maybe i can share something
33:43 - with you
33:44 - that might give you value that's really
33:46 - the primary reason that i'm here today
33:48 - um with that said that's me guys and
33:51 - here we got sunny
33:53 - so guys here is the back story behind me
33:56 - so if many of you guys don't know i'm
33:57 - sunny
33:58 - you guys give me a nickname i really
34:00 - like it it's papa react
34:01 - so follows from papa python we got the
34:03 - react code we got a few different names
34:06 - and i followed the system guys so i went
34:08 - a little bit of a different route right
34:10 - i followed the system i went to
34:12 - university i spent money
34:14 - on a degree i did all this stuff i went
34:16 - through the entire
34:18 - process right i thought it would land me
34:20 - the job at the end and then when it
34:21 - finally came to getting the job
34:23 - this is exactly a visual representation
34:26 - of what life did to me it literally
34:28 - slapped me in the face right i was like
34:31 - it's like they stepped on my degree and
34:33 - like it was like it was worth
34:34 - nothing right so i it was a very hard
34:37 - learning point at that point
34:38 - then what i started to do is i started
34:40 - to teach how to code so i was teaching
34:42 - throughout
34:42 - university to make money i started to
34:44 - freelance and then i started to work
34:46 - in different uh industries as a coder
34:48 - and i was lucky enough to make 200
34:50 - 000 by the age of 23. and then what
34:53 - happened

38:31 - first of all i love my new job it's my
38:33 - first six figure job and i'm learning a
38:35 - lot of different things that i don't
38:36 - ever get to practice when i work for
38:38 - smaller companies
38:39 - i've only been working this job for a
38:40 - little over a week but it's awesome
38:43 - second i just got accepted to the second
38:45 - round of interviews with google

38:58 - so around probably 20 or 30 000 a year
39:00 - and
39:01 - i only joined back in june or july

39:06 - decide
39:07 - i want to thank everyone in this
39:09 - community for their support
39:10 - because i'm mostly here for the
39:12 - community and it's helped me in a large
39:14 - way nice dude he used to show up on our
39:17 - live streams
39:18 - literally a few weeks ago showing up on
39:20 - our live streams now we probably can't
39:22 - even get a hold of him
39:25 - um so guys we're going to be going deep
39:27 - into building your personal roadmap for
39:29 - making 100k a year as a javascript
39:31 - as a react javascript developer on day
39:34 - five of the live training
39:35 - but for now let's figure out why you
39:38 - want to become a react.js developer
39:40 - sounds good guys all right so with that
39:42 - said let's go
39:44 - so now we're gonna skip over this
39:46 - because this is gonna be like the
39:48 - secret sauce that we're gonna give you
39:50 - guys on the last day
39:52 - and we're gonna show you this like
39:54 - modern javascript developer pyramid of
39:56 - wealth but what i want you to do right
39:58 - now is comment below what are the three
40:00 - things
40:01 - more important to you than money
40:04 - so what are those things comment them
40:06 - below and we're gonna start reading them
40:08 - out
40:09 - i don't know why my facebook is doing
40:10 - this weird thing where like
40:13 - what's today my comments like just keep
40:15 - going up you know enough to keep
40:17 - scrolling down all the time
40:19 - oh you have to scroll all the way to the
40:20 - bottom dude and it'll stick
40:22 - i oh
40:25 - oh we've started to get some things and
40:27 - we've got security
40:29 - learning knowledge peace of mind that's
40:31 - called family a lot of family i see
40:34 - that's nice ah we've got
40:37 - responsibility and happiness that's
40:39 - awesome
40:40 - wow and then this is this is quite
40:43 - hitting one it said food
40:44 - like honestly just food like is it just
40:46 - really to eat put bread on the table us
40:48 - yeah that's one of the main reasons why
40:50 - a lot of us do what we do
40:52 - holy crap somebody gave a 50 donation
40:54 - damn oh yes i earlier okay
40:56 - that was sick yeah susan says one
40:59 - my other half two my mom sadly my dad
41:03 - passed away
41:04 - and three peace and harmony that is a
41:07 - beautiful reason
41:08 - to be coding zachary says freedom to
41:11 - experience new things freedom to support
41:13 - friends and family and the ability to
41:16 - change
41:16 - lives through future technologies
41:20 - we have uh ahmed sites and helping my
41:23 - family
41:24 - because i enjoy it and number three to
41:26 - prove my to improve on myself
41:28 - nice yup we got nicholas over here
41:31 - and he says making an impact gaining
41:34 - knowledge and supporting my family
41:36 - that's beautiful
41:37 - i love how much these everybody like
41:39 - loves their family and how much they're
41:40 - focused on yeah i love that
41:42 - i mean guys you're not going to be
41:44 - judged for whatever your goal is but
41:45 - that's a really good goal to have
41:47 - because they'll ground you
41:48 - when your goals are when your goals are
41:51 - jacked like that and your why is
41:53 - strong think of it like you know you see
41:56 - a tree
41:58 - underneath the tree you got all these
42:00 - roots that go so
42:01 - deep that you will never see but that's
42:04 - actually how the tree is anchored
42:06 - up and cannot be broken those values
42:09 - that you have in your life the humility
42:11 - the groundedness
42:13 - those are your roots that's what grounds
42:16 - you and makes you
42:16 - strong so even before you start becoming
42:19 - a react developer it's important that
42:21 - you get your roots
42:22 - solid and your why is powerful because
42:25 - that's
42:26 - you know besides just it being fun
42:28 - that's what's going to really get you
42:29 - going through that
42:31 - exactly now another thing we want you to

42:36 - roadmap so the more you answer this the

42:54 - in the challenge so make sure you click
42:55 - the link below in the description join
42:57 - the facebook group and jump on
42:59 - now guys what can making money as a
43:02 - react javascript developer help you
43:04 - achieve
43:04 - in your life so now let's get to what
43:06 - money can help you do
43:08 - and start dropping it in the comments
43:10 - below
43:12 - exactly so we want to definitely see
43:16 - that
43:16 - so sunny like what was it for you let's
43:18 - just talk about you for a second
43:20 - what let's do it yeah so for you when
43:22 - you were making money what what did it
43:23 - help you with
43:25 - so it was actually honestly it was it
43:28 - was a tough
43:29 - situation that i was put in at one point
43:30 - where like money was
43:32 - a big issue right so like money for a
43:34 - lot of us is a big issue so
43:36 - i needed a way of making money and now
43:38 - coding was just there it was a it was a
43:40 - situation where i always
43:41 - sort of enjoyed something right but when
43:43 - you enjoy something you don't really
43:44 - think that you can make an income from
43:46 - it
43:46 - right but like we just like it
43:48 - completely flipped it on its head and i
43:50 - started to make money from that
43:51 - and honestly the main thing for me was i
43:53 - used to see my mom work so
43:55 - hard right so she used to work so hard
43:57 - to provide for us
43:58 - so i wanted to basically be able to pay
44:00 - and pay like and return the favor
44:03 - somehow so for me that was a huge why
44:06 - that was a huge why it wasn't to buy a
44:07 - fancy car it wasn't to buy a fancy house
44:09 - it was simply to repay for what somebody
44:12 - had done for me
44:13 - and that that was actually my main
44:15 - driving factor so whenever i was
44:16 - debugging whenever i was sat there for
44:18 - hours and my code wouldn't work
44:19 - i'd be thinking in the back of my head
44:21 - that look some like my mom went through
44:24 - this a lot harder and it's my job
44:26 - pretty much the main person who's also
44:29 - there to help her yeah exactly
44:33 - so you know because i know somebody in
44:35 - the chat earlier
44:36 - was like hey my dad passed away so she
44:39 - had to be there for her mom
44:41 - right so like you have to you had to
44:43 - step up as that big son
44:45 - and be able to actually support and help
44:47 - your mom out
44:48 - and it's funny because for me a lot of
44:50 - the reason why i started coding
44:52 - and pushing myself so hard and didn't
44:54 - just want a nine-to-five job
44:55 - was actually because of my mom so nice
44:59 - a lot of us it's actually like that's
45:00 - one of the reasons yomna says
45:02 - supporting my family and starting a
45:04 - business he almost says buy me a house
45:07 - um louis says i think money can help me
45:09 - get a lot of free time and be happy
45:12 - um yeah so so angie says support family
45:15 - be a better person and show my kids they
45:16 - can achieve their goals
45:18 - guys these are really fast amazing
45:21 - reasons that you guys are dropping in
45:22 - and i really think it's going to help
45:24 - you in your careers as a developer so
45:26 - and and thank you for continuing to play
45:29 - all out
45:30 - all right so you guys already dropped
45:33 - this below you guys talked about
45:34 - financial freedom supporting
45:36 - family having more time to spend with
45:38 - your loved ones now
45:39 - here's the next question that we have
45:41 - for you because this is again going to
45:43 - help you
45:44 - decide your ultimate career as a
45:46 - react.js developer
45:47 - and what you're looking for so do you
45:50 - want to work
45:51 - freelance or do you want to work
45:53 - full-time
45:55 - i think this is an important distinction
45:57 - that you have to make because
45:59 - here's what i'll say right i think a lot
46:00 - of it depends on your personality type
46:02 - are you more risk averse or are you more
46:04 - risk tolerant
46:05 - for example if you are maybe more
46:07 - risk-averse and
46:09 - you don't want to take a lot of risk you
46:12 - will
46:12 - want a full-time job that's just one
46:14 - example maybe if you want to take more
46:17 - risk you want freelancing
46:19 - um here's another thing do you care
46:21 - about having
46:22 - a bigger upside or do you care about
46:24 - having like
46:25 - a bigger safety net so if you want a
46:27 - bigger safety net
46:28 - go for a full-time job if you want a
46:30 - higher upside maybe freelancing
46:32 - so both of them can be very fruitful
46:36 - there's no right or wrong answer it
46:38 - really depends on your personality so
46:39 - i think you have had experience with
46:41 - both because you have worked for really
46:42 - big companies
46:43 - you've worked sunny has worked for tesco
46:46 - which is essentially
46:48 - a walmart in uk and
46:51 - he worked as a software developer right
46:53 - there
46:54 - so yeah yeah talk to me about you know
46:57 - free dance and full-time what are the
46:59 - benefits and maybe just some of your own
47:01 - personal
47:02 - story with it too yeah so honestly what
47:05 - i would say is
47:06 - for me it was a lot about security right
47:08 - i needed some some solid security some
47:10 - secure income coming in every month so
47:13 - the route of going down the full-time
47:14 - route
47:15 - worked for me really well now you start
47:17 - to hit a bit of a roof when that happens
47:19 - right so you
47:20 - yes you get much better you have a lot
47:22 - of mentors that you can look to
47:23 - you can improve your skills as a
47:24 - developer but you start to reach a point
47:27 - well at least i did i started to reach a
47:29 - point where i wanted to push my income
47:31 - i wanted to be able to say i can handle
47:33 - more so what i did is actually combine
47:35 - the two
47:35 - and a lot of people never think that's a
47:37 - possibility i used to freelance in my
47:39 - spare times on the weekends
47:41 - after work i would take on jobs
47:42 - freelance and then you actually started
47:44 - to build up and i was doing that for
47:45 - quite a while
47:46 - until i kind of would jump between jobs
47:48 - and i would kind of push my income as i
47:50 - did it
47:51 - now what i would say is i did go at 1.4
47:53 - freelance
47:54 - and the one thing that i will tell you
47:56 - is yes you raised the roof
47:58 - as to your potential income but you're
48:01 - also dealing with
48:02 - not just one boss but several bosses now
48:04 - so there's lots of pros
48:05 - there's lots of cons like cars you you
48:07 - what did you do when you were sort of
48:09 - coming up as a developer was it more
48:10 - sort of the freelance route was it more
48:12 - the job and how did you find that so
48:15 - i have actually in my entire life never
48:17 - had a full-time job
48:19 - oh nice yeah ever yeah so for example
48:22 - when i was 15
48:24 - i started teaching people chess and
48:26 - started freelancing
48:28 - literally with chess and i think in when
48:31 - i was 15 i hit
48:32 - probably like 20 000 that year and then
48:35 - when i was 16 i was doing chess and i
48:38 - think i sk
48:38 - i skilled chess up to like i think 60
48:40 - 000 that year
48:43 - and then at 17 i was like still doing
48:46 - chess and scaled it up and then around
48:48 - 19 or 20 is when i started really coding
48:52 - my experience with coding is i
48:55 - went the freelancing route because that
48:57 - is what i was familiar with and i
48:59 - personally enjoyed it a lot
49:01 - because one is you have multiple bosses
49:03 - but then two
49:04 - it's also that you have multiple jobs so
49:07 - you
49:07 - have like leverage for example you know
49:09 - if i just really didn't like working
49:11 - with one of them
49:12 - i could leave or i had more leverage to
49:15 - negotiate
49:16 - so for me because i'm very risk tolerant
49:19 - i just
49:19 - personally enjoyed that more i'm sure if
49:22 - i actually got a high-paying full-time
49:23 - job
49:24 - i am 100 000 sure that i would have
49:26 - taken it
49:27 - 100 000 sure but i think when i was
49:31 - doing that i had such little experience
49:33 - that i don't think anybody would give me
49:34 - a full-time job
49:36 - but like i was just hustling and getting
49:38 - freelancing jobs left and right
49:40 - literally
49:40 - three months into my coding experience i
49:42 - started like applying
49:44 - for jobs for interviews for um
49:48 - teaching people coding and i started
49:50 - making my income like teaching
49:52 - people coding and so i'm like literally
49:54 - if i can teach somebody hello world and
49:56 - somebody wants me to teach them like
49:58 - how for loops work and how to solve
50:00 - basic problems like fizzbuzz as long as
50:01 - i'm adding value to their life
50:03 - and they're happy paying me 35 an hour
50:06 - 40
50:06 - an hour i'm happy because i'm i'm i'm
50:09 - more i've always been more obsessed with
50:11 - forget about what you think forget about
50:12 - what i think what can bring somebody
50:14 - else value
50:16 - yeah and i just want to do that as much
50:18 - as i can and if you think that i'm
50:20 - bringing you 35
50:21 - of value or 25 of value and you're
50:23 - paying me that that's great i will take
50:25 - that money
50:25 - and i just re i would reinvest it into
50:28 - my skills
50:28 - meaning i would hire a react developer i
50:31 - would hire like
50:32 - you know and when i say hire i mean like
50:34 - literally go on platforms like
50:35 - codementor or whatever and like
50:37 - pay by the hour so they teach me react
50:41 - yeah spend all my money like building up
50:42 - my skill set so
50:44 - my experience i agree i agree with that
50:46 - dude i just want to add one thing to
50:47 - that i
50:48 - so exactly what cars you said kind of
50:50 - focus about your sort of value that
50:52 - you're going to get deliver
50:53 - right and then what one thing i think it
50:54 - was gary v said this is a 33
50:56 - rule and i always coach this rule right
50:58 - you should spend the 33
51:00 - of your time teaching somebody who's
51:02 - slightly below your level right whether
51:04 - it be like you're teaching somebody
51:05 - you're coaching somebody whatever it is
51:07 - and you can do that at any level guys
51:09 - when we teach that in the course uh and
51:11 - to spend a third of your time with
51:13 - somebody above whether it be like taking
51:15 - a freelance job that's higher than you
51:16 - or maybe like
51:17 - taking on a permanent position and then
51:19 - a third of your time with a job that
51:20 - you've maybe
51:21 - hustled to get or client you've hustled
51:23 - to get but you're just spending your
51:24 - time doing it
51:25 - and that will put you in a position
51:27 - where you're kind of between me and qazi
51:29 - and i kind of feel that that's the
51:30 - ultimate way of kind of
51:32 - boosting your growth as a developer yeah
51:34 - i definitely think it's
51:36 - the fastest way i have yet to see a
51:38 - faster way
51:39 - uh that works for most people um
51:42 - somebody in the comments
51:43 - dropped uh his name was amer yeah and he
51:46 - was like i've been
51:47 - teaching chess two for the last five
51:49 - years damn oh nice
51:51 - that is awesome that is so cool chess is
51:54 - a beautiful way to develop your mind
51:55 - yeah i love that people are talking
51:57 - about chess that's pretty cool
51:59 - jalo says freelance is way better if you
52:01 - care about your time and as quasi said a
52:03 - risk taker
52:04 - some people are saying full-time job is
52:06 - the route that they want to go ready and
52:07 - says i still think full-time is better
52:09 - and guys again both ways are good pick
52:12 - one and then that's and start with that
52:14 - right and then see how you
52:15 - like it april says i'd want to start out
52:18 - full time and freelance on the side once
52:20 - i'm established
52:21 - freelance for life that's a freaking
52:23 - great way to go too
52:26 - and guys listen to what cars you said at
52:27 - the end of it like start
52:29 - right there was a key there literally
52:32 - just start there
52:33 - is always going to be this debate up do
52:34 - i do freelance do i do just
52:36 - start your journey right now today like
52:39 - if you haven't already yeah
52:40 - and it's important because check this
52:41 - out right here we got julius and
52:43 - hopefully you guys can read what this
52:45 - says here i'll try to maybe zoom in
52:47 - but julia says my win for this week is
52:49 - receiving a job offer as a software
52:52 - programmer i went through over 20
52:55 - interviews during past six months every
52:57 - time i got close to getting a job
52:59 - the position was put on hold because of
53:02 - covet 19.
53:03 - i keep pushing forward even though i
53:06 - kept getting rejected
53:08 - that's thanks all that helped with
53:10 - advice along the way
53:12 - this is just the beginning getting my
53:14 - foot in the door i'm going to continue
53:16 - learning freelancing from this great
53:18 - program
53:19 - this course helped with sharpening the
53:20 - foundation needed to get hired thanks
53:24 - that's awesome dude this is awesome this
53:26 - is somebody inside
53:27 - profit with javascript and they are
53:29 - applying
53:30 - non-stop and guess what this is the guy
53:32 - that's actually going to get
53:34 - you know the job this is the guy who's
53:36 - going to be able to do it just
53:37 - non-stop and we want i want to show you
53:40 - also how much hard work is required
53:42 - behind the scenes
53:43 - so this is awesome elizabeth says
53:46 - um i missed it but she basically
53:49 - yeah i yeah i don't know why my facebook
53:52 - is just being weird it just keeps
53:53 - going crazy but um okay guys so this is
53:56 - great uh
53:58 - ultimately is gonna be your preference
53:59 - between the two pick one
54:02 - all right and like i said start all
54:04 - right let's go
54:05 - forward so now why react js now top tech
54:08 - companies guys in the world are using
54:10 - javascript in react.js so you got
54:12 - facebook microsoft linkedin
54:14 - ebay tesla groupon netflix google
54:18 - uber tinder airbnb paypal and the list
54:22 - goes on
54:24 - and what's this sunny so here guys we
54:28 - have the popularity and this
54:30 - is on uh i believe it's uh is this this
54:32 - is stack overflow right
54:34 - guys if you can see the most popular
54:36 - language right now and it's not by a
54:37 - little bit it's by far
54:39 - is javascript right so react is
54:42 - obviously a library inside of javascript
54:44 - so by knowing javascript and also i hear
54:45 - a lot of people say i want to be do i
54:47 - become full stack do i become back in
54:48 - front and
54:49 - javascript is both right so that's why
54:52 - that's another reason for its popularity
54:53 - but yeah as you can see it's the most
54:55 - popular
54:56 - uh language garyvee would love it
54:58 - because his answer to everything is
55:00 - always both
55:01 - both yeah exactly both do more
55:05 - i wonder what would happen if i gave
55:07 - gary v like uh three
55:09 - like multiple choice but with three
55:10 - things like should i do a b
55:12 - or c i think he would still be like do
55:14 - both
55:15 - [Laughter]
55:18 - he just disregard exactly what he said i
55:21 - love getting but
55:21 - the best the best thing is dude with
55:24 - javascript you can do both
55:26 - you can do web apps and you can do
55:28 - native apps yep
55:29 - exactly yeah and what type of so yeah
55:31 - you could do web apps you can do ios
55:33 - android apps like
55:34 - tesla was you know we have tesla with
55:36 - react we got facebook with react
55:38 - and javascript and then you can also do
55:40 - server apps like netflix and we actually
55:42 - built netflix which was a clone and we
55:44 - showed it to you guys in our youtube
55:46 - channel now job opportunities and salary
55:49 - guys
55:49 - so check it out for javascript and react
55:53 - in your first year as a developer with
55:55 - less than one year of experience as
55:57 - possible you could be doing 75 000 a
55:59 - year
56:00 - this is data these are stats this is
56:02 - according to pay scale
56:04 - um and then uh between one to four years
56:07 - you could be at 82
56:08 - 000 and beyond yeah here if you look on
56:11 - indeed
56:12 - you got over 45 000 jobs listed there
56:14 - right now and then if i go here to up
56:17 - work you see 8
56:18 - 000 jobs available there right now so
56:20 - you could also just go there and check
56:22 - it for yourself
56:24 - yep and for react js developer
56:27 - this is this the average salary no this
56:29 - is better than the average size this is
56:30 - a median salary
56:32 - yeah it's a median salary so usually you
56:34 - may come in around 68 to 100k i'd say
56:37 - like as a sort of junior but as a good
56:39 - junior developer i'd say
56:40 - and then guys it's never let anyone tell
56:44 - you
56:45 - that you can't reach that number right
56:47 - because like i'm
56:48 - it's just like it really pisses me off
56:50 - when i hear a very conservative
56:52 - developer who's like
56:53 - yeah you're gonna have to work for four
56:55 - years to get that you don't have to work
56:57 - for four years
56:58 - it's all about how you build yourself as
57:00 - a developer how you build your soft
57:01 - skills as a developer and there's more
57:03 - to it
57:03 - it's not just like woo random stuff like
57:06 - sunny was making over a hundred thousand
57:09 - you know a year as a react developer
57:12 - yeah honestly and that was combined
57:14 - between a salary
57:15 - and some freelance work and that pushed
57:17 - me over the 100k mark
57:19 - and guys it's possible it can be done
57:22 - and i can tell you my salary went from
57:24 - very it was way it was actually below
57:26 - that low mark
57:27 - my salary when i first started coding
57:29 - right and it went up to
57:31 - literally just kind of at the median
57:33 - mark pretty much
57:34 - and because this is the representative
57:36 - is in pounds so you literally got pushed
57:38 - up to the media mark in two years so let
57:39 - me ask you guys who here would like to
57:42 - make a hundred and twenty thousand
57:43 - a year would you like to make 120 000 a
57:46 - year
57:47 - doing react and building projects
57:51 - reply to me in the comments below and if
57:53 - you would like to make 120 000 a year
57:57 - then make sure you hit that like button
58:01 - [Laughter]
58:03 - all right smash that like button guys
58:05 - get this video out to as many people as
58:07 - you can
58:08 - all right so absolutely insanity
58:11 - we have a lot of people we've got 1200
58:13 - people live on facebook and then i don't
58:15 - even know how many we have
58:16 - on i believe we have people watching on
58:18 - youtube over 3500 viewers on youtube so
58:21 - that's fantastic
58:23 - all right let's keep going and if you're
58:24 - on youtube and you want to participate
58:25 - in the challenge
58:26 - click the link in the description and
58:28 - join the facebook group because that's
58:30 - where this challenge is happening
58:32 - all right so now let's talk about web
58:35 - frameworks and which ones are the most
58:38 - popular according to the professional
58:39 - developers
58:41 - yeah so guys you can see react is at the
58:44 - top of that list and something that i
58:46 - want to point out
58:48 - yeah exactly jquery is dying fast
58:51 - literally bootstrap you drop support for
58:53 - it
58:54 - was just about to say yeah bootstrap
58:56 - literally just killed jason
58:57 - got rid of it it's too slow it's way too
58:59 - slow everything that we you could do in
59:01 - jquery now we can do it in pure
59:03 - javascript and
59:04 - do it a lot easier like all that
59:05 - manipulation stuff right now just built
59:07 - into javascript
59:09 - exactly dude it's so much faster and
59:11 - guys i always see
59:12 - comments about like what about angular
59:14 - what about this stuff
59:16 - look at the numbers and there is a big
59:18 - difference between the angular demand
59:20 - and the react demand and something i
59:21 - will tell you is that the angular demand
59:22 - is slightly on the diminishing end
59:24 - whereas react is flying like it's
59:26 - unbelievably on a high right now
59:28 - and it's something which you're gonna
59:30 - like to answer your questions like
59:32 - rian angular net.net have a look at this
59:34 - this will answer it for you
59:36 - nice yeah i would see like april saying
59:38 - i would love to make 120 000 a year
59:40 - patch says [ __ ] a
59:42 - yes brian says hell yeah bring on the
59:44 - 120k show me the money
59:47 - i love that and it's okay to like money
59:49 - because you can do so much with it right
59:51 - you can buy your time back you can buy
59:52 - your freedom back
59:54 - um and i was actually on a call with
59:56 - patch before he joined profit with
59:58 - javascript and also this challenge
60:01 - and he as actually he was a bartender
60:04 - and then because of kovid like ended up
60:06 - losing his job
60:07 - and he's a man of many talents so he's
60:09 - like a bartender and then he's also an
60:11 - actor and i'm sure he can do a ton of
60:13 - more things i can't even think about
60:14 - right now
60:15 - so do it is like crazy epic and now
60:18 - he's picking up coding he's like hey can
60:21 - i pick up coding
60:22 - and i'm like yeah dude i'm like i've
60:24 - seen everybody pick up coding but like
60:26 - i haven't seen an actor or a bartender
60:28 - pick up coding
60:29 - so i was like let's see if this is
60:32 - actually possible and then you start
60:33 - picking it up and then a few weeks later
60:36 - he's like
60:36 - i didn't know any coding and now he's
60:38 - like building apps and putting them up
60:40 - on the stories and tagging us
60:42 - and i'm like dude what the hell this is
60:44 - awesome he built a peaky blinder
60:46 - the peaky blinder was his favorite show
60:48 - on netflix so he built like this app
60:50 - and it's like all about peaky blinder
60:53 - nice
60:54 - dude that's awesome guys quick story as
60:56 - well my first
60:57 - one of my sort of first students after
61:00 - university
61:01 - was a 12 year old student he was a 12
61:04 - year old student so i always see
61:05 - questions of am i too young or am i too
61:07 - old guys 12 years old and guess what
61:10 - after seven months of teaching him how
61:12 - to code from no
61:13 - experience with one session a week he
61:16 - landed his own school at 12 years old
61:19 - guys oh
61:20 - his own school as a client oh yeah right
61:25 - yeah that kid is awesome and i think
61:27 - that it just goes to show what's
61:29 - possible so nasir at 14
61:31 - or abdullah 12 like it just goes to show
61:34 - that it's possible you know age doesn't
61:35 - really matter
61:36 - whether you're older or younger just put
61:38 - in the freaking work
61:39 - you know what i mean like don't use
61:41 - excuses to hold you back also react is
61:43 - one of the most
61:44 - loved programming languages um and you
61:47 - can see
61:47 - over here there's also type we got
61:49 - typescript right which
61:51 - is part of it so typescript is actually
61:54 - one of the things that's most loved and
61:55 - with react you can actually use
61:58 - typescript and then here if we looked at
62:00 - the most
62:01 - loved and wanted most frameworks
62:05 - um we got react at the top
62:08 - above everything and exactly one of the
62:10 - reasons is because it's actually
62:12 - secretly not even a framework it's
62:14 - actually a library
62:15 - it's very very lightweight yet it's also
62:19 - extremely powerful
62:21 - yeah and guys the main thing the thing
62:23 - is we showed you what the love
62:24 - frameworks are we showed you that sort
62:26 - of stuff but the most
62:27 - wanted framework is what is going to
62:29 - lead you to your
62:30 - sort of monetary goal right if it's
62:33 - wanted it's in demand
62:34 - and we can see here on indeed how many
62:36 - jobs have we got here quasi
62:37 - we got 51 781
62:40 - jobs just on indeed if you type in react
62:43 - so the amount of jobs here are
62:46 - absolutely insane and you know what i
62:47 - would do
62:48 - i would literally make this amazon
62:50 - project that we're gonna show you
62:51 - tomorrow
62:52 - on day two three and four and i'll just
62:55 - start applying to some of these jobs
62:57 - just to see what they say maybe they're
62:58 - looking for an intern maybe i'll just
63:00 - tell them i'll work for free
63:02 - don't underestimate the power of working
63:04 - for free
63:05 - guys like it's absolutely insane most of
63:08 - the people that actually started working
63:09 - with us at cleverprogrammer initially
63:11 - started by working for free
63:13 - and brought value and then they're now
63:15 - working at clever programmer and killing
63:17 - it
63:18 - so with a lot of these jobs they are
63:20 - looking for people who are talented or
63:22 - looking to learn and they can train you
63:25 - exactly exactly and just to note that
63:27 - that's just in the united states 50 000
63:29 - jobs
63:30 - exactly it's global international and it
63:32 - doesn't matter if you're outside the
63:33 - states you can land that job inside the
63:35 - state just like you can see here so in
63:37 - u.s it's about 6 000
63:39 - a month is the average salary in canada
63:42 - it's about 4 000 a month in germany
63:44 - about 4 000 a month and united kingdom
63:46 - about 3 000 a month
63:47 - so yeah even if you're can't get a job
63:51 - in usa like there's so much of the world
63:53 - you can then get a job and you can get a
63:54 - job
63:55 - in germany online or united kingdom and
63:57 - now the most of the world is doing
63:58 - things online and remote so i think
64:00 - the opportunity now is more than ever
64:02 - because before
64:03 - they were looking to hire people in
64:05 - person now
64:07 - i don't know maybe this thing is going
64:08 - to be going on for a whole another year
64:10 - so i actually think there's more
64:11 - opportunity now than ever
64:13 - and you're part of the global space now
64:16 - you can really get a job anywhere
64:19 - exactly and guys it depends it doesn't
64:20 - really matter what country you're in
64:22 - you can access markets and this isn't
64:24 - possible in any other job market
64:26 - like you can access the us market you
64:28 - can access the uk market the
64:30 - canadian market even if you're in like
64:32 - in sri lanka
64:33 - in different countries malaysia it
64:35 - doesn't matter where you are
64:36 - you can access these markets um
64:40 - and so yeah you guys can definitely
64:42 - access these markets we are
64:43 - at 148 dollars in donation thank you
64:46 - guys so much we're sorry we're not
64:48 - giving it a shout out as much but again
64:51 - really really appreciate it that's
64:52 - massive yeah um and guys remember
64:55 - tomorrow we're going to be live at 11
64:57 - a.m so this is just a friendly reminder
64:59 - if you need to add it to your phone just
65:01 - go ahead on your phone
65:03 - and open up your clock app and just set
65:06 - alarms
65:06 - for 11 a.m pacific so whatever that time
65:10 - is
65:10 - but literally just like spam it like
65:12 - this because i think that this is going
65:14 - to be one of the most important things
65:16 - and
65:16 - tomorrow we're just bringing the heat
65:17 - tomorrow we are building amazon
65:22 - no joke we're building amazon tomorrow
65:24 - guys full on amazon
65:25 - so you definitely want to show up for it
65:27 - because it's going to be the most
65:29 - valuable thing
65:30 - you can put on your portfolio and i we
65:32 - know students have already landed jobs
65:35 - with the things that they've built
65:36 - so you can very likely be that success
65:38 - story so make sure you put your alarms
65:40 - on
65:41 - for that and with that let's continue
65:43 - exactly
65:44 - so here we go now what can you do with
65:46 - react now guys here are the things you
65:48 - can do with react right you can actually
65:49 - build a netflix app like this
65:51 - which we actually built on clever
65:53 - programmer and shows you guys how to do
65:55 - it
65:55 - you can build facebook clone just like
65:58 - this
65:59 - with react and you know sunny had a live
66:01 - training and he showed you guys
66:03 - exactly how to do this you can build the
66:06 - airbnb
66:06 - app and this is also built with react
66:10 - and this was built from scratch and we
66:12 - showed you guys how to build this on our
66:13 - youtube channel
66:15 - yep and we taught all of these lives for
66:18 - free on youtube so definitely go check
66:21 - them out
66:22 - but today what we're going to be doing
66:24 - is something really really special and
66:26 - tomorrow we're going to be doing
66:27 - something really special because now
66:29 - we're not only going to build amazon
66:31 - but we're going to build the entire back
66:32 - end out and the ability to accept
66:34 - payments so now this is going to be
66:36 - from 0 to 100 a completed project you
66:38 - can put on your portfolio
66:40 - and literally land jobs with it so
66:42 - tomorrow son you want to talk about what
66:44 - they'll be doing
66:45 - exactly guys so we've broken it down
66:47 - into three
66:48 - days right and at the end of the three
66:50 - days what you're going to have is a
66:52 - fully functional amazon clone so it's
66:55 - going to have this ui it's this
66:57 - beautiful ui
66:58 - there's commit it's going to be
66:59 - responsive we're going to have basket
67:01 - functionality we are going to have
67:03 - order checkout processing we are going
67:04 - to have payment processing
67:06 - which is insane guys like you'll be able
67:08 - to run a card
67:09 - on you this on on this program and it
67:12 - will work
67:13 - right yeah we're also going to have sign
67:14 - in functionality the ability to create
67:16 - accounts log
67:17 - in all the data is going to be tracked
67:19 - in firebase
67:20 - firestore which is a real-time database
67:22 - and here's the app right now so we can
67:24 - actually demo it a little bit and if you
67:26 - guys can find
67:27 - um so yeah this is what the app right
67:29 - now
67:30 - and check it out you guys when i hit add
67:32 - to basket
67:33 - on any of these so when i add to basket
67:35 - for this one or the next one
67:37 - you're actually gonna see that cart all
67:39 - the way over there
67:41 - and it's gonna change to two so for
67:43 - example if i do add to basket and add to
67:45 - basket
67:45 - boom now it's at two if i go inside of
67:48 - this
67:48 - both of these items are now here in my
67:51 - basket my item total is 298.
67:53 - if i get rid of one of them remove from
67:55 - basket now we're at 199.
67:58 - if i get rid of both of them boom gone
68:00 - you will also have the ability to sign
68:02 - in
68:03 - and sign out so user authentication is
68:05 - going to be a part of it and just look
68:06 - at the experience of this app it
68:08 - literally looks like amazon but this is
68:10 - amazon clone
68:12 - and it's so damn fast everything i click
68:14 - on
68:15 - is just instant there's no wait time
68:19 - exactly guys and to cover some of the
68:21 - points in case you guys are interested
68:23 - we are going to be using stripe for the
68:24 - payment processing if you guys are
68:26 - interested in learning things like
68:28 - redux redux is going to be used in the
68:30 - form of the react context api so we're
68:32 - going to show you guys how to go ahead
68:34 - and
68:34 - create that with the react context api
68:36 - we've got react router for dynamic page
68:39 - viewing inside of react apps
68:41 - we have we're going to deploy the thing
68:43 - so we're going to show you how once
68:44 - you've built this entire app
68:46 - how simple it is to go ahead and deploy
68:48 - it with firebase hosting
68:50 - and all of this guys we are going to
68:52 - make it so simple to follow
68:54 - so simple to go ahead and copy
68:55 - everything that we do learn from what we
68:57 - do
68:58 - and then you guys will be able to add
68:59 - this to your portfolio which we're going
69:01 - to give you today
69:03 - yup and we're going to be giving you the
69:05 - portfolio that sunny just talked about
69:07 - so that's
69:08 - insane on top of all of this so yeah
69:12 - uh zachary says the rest of this month
69:13 - is all react js and clones for me
69:16 - damn can i do it i've never worked on
69:19 - react
69:20 - before absolutely you can't even if
69:22 - you're a complete beginner
69:23 - um somebody says ricardo says are we
69:25 - going to use stripe.js for payments i
69:27 - think
69:28 - there's a react stripe something right
69:29 - there's a react library for
69:32 - stripe yeah so we actually have two
69:34 - parts we have we're going to be teaching
69:36 - you how to do cloud functions to process
69:38 - the payment
69:38 - so firebase cloud functions to go ahead
69:40 - and process a payment and then we also
69:42 - have the front end
69:43 - which is how you basically capture the
69:45 - user's card details
69:46 - and that's something called stripe
69:48 - checkout so we're going to implement
69:49 - stripe checkout on the front end
69:51 - and that's going to allow you to do the
69:52 - whole user experience of
69:54 - collecting the card details and all that
69:55 - sweet stuff yeah with payment so much
69:57 - can go wrong
69:59 - but like yeah and it's going to be crazy
70:01 - building it live i don't think anybody
70:03 - in the developer world has
70:04 - built payment processors live dude
70:08 - tell me anyone right now who has done
70:10 - the entire tech stack
70:12 - is a full stack build it has firebase it
70:14 - has complete payment functionality
70:16 - there's nobody doing it right now and
70:17 - like we're gonna break it down to a
70:19 - point
70:19 - where beginners can do it yeah that that
70:22 - is nuts
70:23 - so guys definitely you want to show up
70:25 - tomorrow and if you're coming tomorrow
70:27 - make sure you
70:28 - say in the chat that i'm gonna be
70:30 - showing up tomorrow i'm committing
70:32 - to showing up tomorrow and then put the
70:35 - time
70:36 - at 11 a.m pacific okay los angeles time
70:39 - we want to see those comments starting
70:41 - to go right
70:42 - because we want to see you there and i
70:44 - want to shout out some of the people who
70:46 - are committing to showing up tomorrow
70:49 - yep
70:49 - all right so you're going to be learning
70:52 - how to set up firebase
70:53 - full user authentication learn how to
70:56 - use react router
70:57 - react contact cpi add to basket
70:59 - functionality checkout page
71:00 - login page setting up payment gateways
71:02 - and much more and done in a way where
71:04 - it's going to be for beginners so that's
71:06 - going to be epic
71:07 - liz frost says i'll be here tomorrow 1
71:09 - p.m pacific yes
71:11 - let's let's go let's do that on liz is
71:14 - awesome
71:14 - and here is where the fun begins
71:18 - and again when you ask yourself where do
71:20 - i begin it doesn't matter just start
71:22 - are we ever gonna fix these slides where
71:24 - the gif image comes first and the title
71:25 - comes later
71:26 - yeah i mean it was a nice transition you
71:29 - know
71:30 - all right all right cool so let's learn
71:32 - some react.js
71:34 - guys and in react.js right we have a ton
71:37 - of different things
71:39 - so one of the main things we're going to
71:40 - be teaching you is what sunny react
71:42 - components
71:44 - yeah so we're going to teach you guys
71:46 - what are like we're going to teach you
71:47 - guys pretty much the fundamentals of
71:49 - react so
71:49 - what are react components react
71:51 - component react is essentially broken
71:52 - down into you just write small
71:54 - components that are reused so for
71:56 - example the products on amazon
71:58 - you write that code once and you just
72:00 - reuse it as many times as you need to so
72:02 - let me
72:02 - yeah let me just show that highlight
72:04 - that so it's not intimidating and it
72:06 - just sounds simple so for example
72:08 - when um we're gonna show you literally
72:10 - tomorrow how to make
72:11 - this product like so this one thing over
72:14 - here right
72:15 - this is gonna be a product component
72:18 - literally then it's almost as easy as
72:20 - writing one line and just copy paste the
72:21 - entire thing so then you don't
72:23 - need to keep writing your code
72:26 - for making a new product just write one
72:28 - line that says product and boom it
72:30 - creates
72:31 - this whole product here exactly
72:34 - and then we're going to show you guys
72:36 - even the components underneath there so
72:38 - you see they actually go ahead and
72:40 - behave responsively
72:41 - so you can see that's the same component
72:44 - it's just we're going to show you guys
72:45 - how to reuse the same component
72:47 - and also be responsive so it's going to
72:50 - be a
72:50 - huge massive uh knowledge bomb tomorrow
72:53 - so make sure you guys are here tomorrow
72:55 - and i can see loads of people in the
72:56 - comments dropping that in
72:58 - it's exciting stuff guys and yeah it's
72:59 - going to be a massive amount of value
73:01 - bomb
73:01 - that's epic yeah we're seeing people so
73:04 - let me see who's uh somebody's saying
73:06 - uh rodney says i will be there tomorrow
73:08 - 2 p.m
73:09 - eastern i'm locked in can't wait to edit
73:12 - the profile let's go
73:13 - daniel says i'll be in tomorrow at 11
73:15 - a.m pst that will be hawaii time hey
73:18 - beautiful candace says i'm committed to
73:20 - showing up tomorrow i'm in all the way
73:22 - guys this is beautiful emmy says excited
73:25 - for tomorrow definitely showing up
73:27 - 11 california time that's 3 p.m for me
73:30 - dino says 4 a.m wake up well worth it
73:34 - hey 4 a.m wake up
73:37 - beautiful nice so you want to touch base
73:39 - more on this or should we move on
73:42 - uh so guys this is a quick shout out so
73:44 - pretty much if you want to sort of have
73:46 - some useful
73:47 - uh i post regularly on me and kazi both
73:50 - do it and here's just a little slide we
73:51 - shared in on our instagram
73:53 - it's just discussing what component
73:55 - based design visually so you pretty much
73:56 - have
73:57 - a web page broken down into components
74:00 - and we're going to run through all of
74:02 - this soon so if you guys
74:03 - don't know the stuff it's completely
74:05 - fine like we said we're going to break
74:07 - it down
74:07 - for beginners um yeah and
74:11 - this is covered in his so for example um
74:14 - for example right now i'm on sunny's
74:16 - page here you guys can see
74:18 - and if i go to react components here i
74:21 - can slide and
74:22 - like just kind of consume his content
74:24 - but then learn so it's tons of value
74:26 - so here he's showing you below below
74:28 - shows a website design based on
74:30 - components
74:31 - so you design your website in a
74:33 - component-based way
74:34 - and then you can pick up so much code
74:37 - class-based components versus
74:38 - function-based components so tons and
74:41 - tons of value bombs like if you guys
74:43 - haven't followed sunny go ahead and do
74:45 - that
74:45 - right now like literally go on instagram
74:49 - and just go to sss four
74:52 - s's just remember that or as yeah all
74:55 - right
74:56 - anger four s's and then anger right
74:58 - after that
74:59 - uh and follow him because he's dropping
75:02 - value bombs there every day
75:05 - exactly and these are a lot of questions
75:06 - we get all the time what are class-based
75:08 - components what functional components
75:10 - and guys we answer those things we're
75:12 - going to answer them today we're going
75:13 - to answer them tomorrow
75:14 - everything that you need just go ahead
75:15 - and follow us on socials and yeah
75:17 - we can go ahead and get started oh crap
75:20 - um
75:21 - i think is this the same person sumit
75:23 - messaged and he said
75:24 - qazi i landed a new job yesterday i
75:27 - already informed sunny yeah
75:28 - nice yep he's also making stories so
75:33 - look at that that's sick so guys when
75:36 - you make stories make sure you guys
75:38 - tag us because then what we do is we'll
75:40 - take your exact story right so now i'm
75:43 - on my story
75:44 - and i'm actually gonna post it so now i
75:47 - just posted his story to my story
75:49 - and he will get a shout out that way too
75:51 - so you guys should do that and take
75:52 - advantage of it
75:54 - exactly and that's going to help you
75:55 - guys grow as well because we tell you
75:57 - guys to record your journey as well
75:59 - so be a part of everything and yeah so
76:01 - tomorrow we're going to be going into
76:03 - hooks in a deeper way in a more
76:05 - technical way
76:06 - but as of now we just want to kind of
76:08 - give you guys the rundown
76:09 - of like a hook they're basically what
76:12 - they really are
76:13 - is they're simple functions they are
76:16 - easy to implement
76:17 - they are more lightweight than classes
76:19 - that's why we would
76:20 - react we won't be doing classes and
76:22 - again if you're a beginner and you don't
76:23 - know difference between classes and
76:25 - functional programming guess what
76:27 - that's a good thing because then we can
76:28 - just get you started on
76:30 - functional based programming and you
76:32 - won't waste your time
76:34 - having to unlearn all the bad habits
76:36 - that you developed
76:38 - exactly exactly it's going to be easy to
76:40 - test
76:41 - we're going to show you how to build
76:42 - custom hooks as well so react
76:45 - hooks are one of the most important
76:46 - things so the more you just get
76:48 - used to hearing and saying it literally
76:50 - the better you'll become
76:52 - yeah and consider yourself lucky guys
76:54 - like you came in right now at a time
76:56 - where there are things like hooks and
76:58 - hooks were a new addition in react 16.8
77:00 - and guys it just makes life so easy so
77:03 - it's so fun to code and react now
77:05 - because of things like hooks and we're
77:06 - going to show you how to use
77:07 - everything in tomorrow's video
77:10 - absolutely
77:11 - all right and let's go ahead so class
77:13 - based versus functional base
77:15 - on the left-hand side right with the
77:16 - class-based component you see over here
77:19 - we have class hello world
77:20 - extends and then it goes react
77:23 - components and that's how
77:25 - you used to do it but now with
77:28 - functional based components it's more
77:30 - like just writing a regular function so
77:32 - you're not doing class in extension
77:33 - you're just doing
77:34 - a function hello world you write your
77:37 - component
77:37 - and then here you can see that you're
77:39 - just rendering it like hello world
77:41 - you know just like how you render your
77:42 - class-based component but why write a
77:44 - class-based one when you can write a
77:46 - functional one
77:47 - exactly and to be honest guys what we do
77:50 - in pwj we even show you because it's a
77:52 - very
77:52 - valuable skill to know the difference
77:54 - between the two and how to translate the
77:56 - code
77:56 - but the main thing is guys do what is
77:58 - simple and we show you what is simple
78:00 - and we're going to show you
78:01 - in tomorrow's build how to build things
78:03 - in the simplest most
78:04 - efficient way yep and britney over here
78:07 - she says
78:08 - um i like this comment she goes hooks
78:11 - are literally
78:12 - a life and time saver
78:15 - so i feel you i fill you with that i
78:18 - came at a time when i was coding react
78:20 - when it was just classes
78:21 - and then when hooks came out i was like
78:23 - god damn it these things
78:24 - are the best thing in the world because
78:26 - literally all you're doing now is coding
78:28 - a function
78:28 - with some kind of input and some kind of
78:30 - output it's simple
78:32 - whereas before you had all this render
78:34 - class based stuff
78:35 - and it was confusing so now it's so fun
78:38 - to code in and you guys are lucky and
78:39 - you're gonna learn all of that stuff who
78:41 - just said they teach so good
78:42 - that they make me cry for not knowing
78:45 - their channel in the past
78:47 - that's insane love that comment
78:51 - damn i love that um
78:55 - so two we're gonna also talk about
78:57 - fundamentals like state and props these
78:58 - are something important that you guys
79:00 - need to know
79:00 - so let's start with state now components
79:04 - have
79:04 - memory what's going on here yep so this
79:08 - is this was my idea because components
79:10 - have something called memory right so we
79:11 - just showed you previously that
79:13 - you can have different product
79:14 - components but the reason why we have a
79:16 - goldfish here is because
79:17 - each component has its own memory right
79:20 - now when you refresh the page the
79:23 - component forgets about its memory
79:25 - so the way i think about this is a
79:27 - component is a bit like a goldfish
79:29 - as soon as you refresh it forgets his
79:30 - memory that's the easiest way to think
79:32 - of it
79:33 - and like we said guys we break it down
79:34 - in the simplest way that's all you need
79:36 - to remember
79:36 - a component can have some memory it can
79:38 - keep retain if you've got a number input
79:40 - it will keep track of what the number is
79:42 - but if you refresh the page the memory
79:43 - goes so what do we do
79:45 - how do we make sure that when we refresh
79:47 - it stays there what do we do
79:48 - so that's where we introduce things like
79:50 - firebase that's where we introduce
79:52 - things like persistence
79:53 - we're going to be showing you guys how
79:55 - to go ahead and do that that's going to
79:56 - be something really important but the
79:58 - main thing to know about state and on
80:00 - the next side we explain this
80:01 - is it all it is in simple terms guys
80:04 - is how you write a variable in a react
80:08 - state is how you write a variable in
80:10 - react that's very important okay
80:12 - yeah yep so you actually say that right
80:14 - over here you're like hey
80:16 - essentially write a variable in react
80:18 - and it's managed within the component
80:20 - and each component has its own isolated
80:22 - state so expound on that
80:24 - yeah so if we have like five different
80:26 - products each
80:27 - different each product is going to have
80:29 - its own little short-term memory
80:31 - okay so let's go to i'm gonna go open
80:33 - that up so go for it and explain
80:36 - right so let's imagine we had a counter
80:38 - on each of these different products
80:39 - right
80:40 - each one is gonna have its own memory so
80:43 - if
80:44 - for example if the first one had a
80:45 - little counter with like one on for
80:47 - example
80:48 - the second one had like two three and
80:50 - you was
80:51 - you was to increment those counters each
80:53 - one
80:54 - would keep track of its own number and
80:56 - then and they don't know anything about
80:58 - the other one they don't basically
81:00 - they're not even communicating with each
81:01 - other right they're just living in their
81:02 - own world
81:04 - they're completely isolated beautiful so
81:06 - they're just it's like
81:07 - you see what i mean by the memory and
81:09 - then if you was to refresh the numbers
81:11 - would all reset to and
81:12 - the initial value that we gave it and
81:14 - with react what's so
81:15 - freaking sick you guys is imagine
81:18 - imagine if
81:19 - i wanted to change this product's image
81:22 - okay
81:22 - now what would happen on a regular
81:24 - website when i do that
81:26 - when i change this image over here from
81:28 - this maybe
81:29 - red color to you know i don't know maybe
81:31 - um
81:32 - blue color i really like blue so if i
81:35 - wanted to change it to a blue
81:36 - what would happen the whole page would
81:39 - refresh and slow down
81:41 - yep and then it would load again and it
81:43 - would be like a poor user experience
81:46 - and now what would happen in react
81:50 - is none of these other products would
81:52 - refresh like
81:53 - 1 3 four and five would not refresh
81:57 - the only thing that would refresh is two
82:00 - and it would also not even refresh the
82:02 - entire page it would
82:03 - literally refresh just only that
82:06 - component
82:07 - that like little product this is why
82:09 - react is
82:10 - so epic have you guys ever experienced
82:12 - that where
82:14 - you drop a comment on instagram and
82:16 - nothing refreshes
82:17 - it just that comment that refreshes but
82:19 - like the whole page just stays the same
82:20 - so you have this
82:21 - great wonderful experience yeah all you
82:24 - get is that lovely little ping
82:26 - as the message pops in that's it super
82:29 - slick super fast
82:30 - i love it or on facebook when you like
82:32 - drop a comment and you get this like
82:33 - little haptic
82:34 - feedback on your phone like vibrates a
82:36 - little bit like
82:37 - so yeah beautiful exactly
82:40 - so that's what he's talking about where
82:42 - it um
82:44 - you know where if you write things and
82:46 - they have their own state it's
82:47 - it's kind of like a really awesome thing
82:50 - all right yep
82:51 - so should we go to the next slide yeah
82:54 - so the next thing we're talking about is
82:55 - is how like
82:56 - essentially we spoke about hooks so
82:58 - we're not going to dive too far into
83:00 - the exact implementation but in a
83:02 - nutshell
83:03 - we have something called the use state
83:05 - hook and what that does is in a single
83:07 - line of code
83:08 - we can just set up the variable in react
83:11 - so for example if we had a count like in
83:13 - the code example here
83:14 - we give it an initial value of zero and
83:17 - you can see the single line of code in a
83:19 - functional component
83:20 - just does everything for us it sets up
83:22 - the component it does it all the clever
83:24 - magic behind and react
83:26 - and it's just one line of code and we
83:27 - just repeat and rinse
83:29 - this sort of cycle and it's very simple
83:31 - once you get the hang of it guys yep
83:33 - very very simple stuff and this code
83:34 - here what it's doing is we're creating
83:36 - some button
83:37 - all right and basically every time i
83:40 - click that button
83:41 - the button will say one and when i click
83:43 - it two more times it'll say three then
83:45 - if i click it three more times it'll say
83:47 - six
83:48 - how is it keeping track it's keeping
83:50 - track through state management
83:52 - and this variable count that we created
83:54 - that's all
83:55 - okay exactly so a really easy way to cr
83:58 - uh
83:58 - keep track of things in react so this is
84:01 - a u-state hook
84:03 - all right um and what the heck are props
84:06 - honey
84:07 - right so this is another fundamental of
84:10 - react and it's very important to cover
84:11 - it today
84:12 - because props are essentially you saw
84:14 - earlier kazi showed you a bunch of
84:16 - different products right
84:17 - yeah now if we're reusing the same
84:20 - product
84:20 - surely how do we make how do they why do
84:23 - they not all look the same
84:24 - and that's because of props so all props
84:27 - stands for properties
84:28 - it just allows you to basically pass in
84:30 - data so let's go back to the amazon app
84:32 - for a second kazi
84:33 - and let's show them that for example we
84:36 - have all those different products on the
84:37 - page
84:38 - each one has a different picture it has
84:40 - a different title it has a different
84:41 - price
84:42 - a different star rating all of those
84:44 - things all we do is just pass it in as
84:46 - props
84:47 - and that's it it's as simple as that and
84:48 - it can render the component
84:50 - in a slightly different way got it okay
84:55 - yeah and that's it that's as simple as
84:56 - it can be and that's where we say guys
84:58 - don't over complicate it it'll be as
85:00 - simple as that um in other words like
85:02 - is one of the things we're passing like
85:04 - a prop is the title
85:05 - of this product right yep exactly got it
85:09 - so yeah so basically like i would
85:11 - imagine that if i create a component
85:13 - called product then what
85:15 - like to get this like red mixer here
85:17 - maybe what i need to do
85:18 - is i need to like write product
85:22 - and then in props just give it like the
85:24 - title
85:26 - um give it the image that it needs and
85:29 - maybe the price that it needs
85:30 - and once i give it that then what it
85:32 - will do on its end
85:34 - is actually um
85:37 - take that title and pop that in
85:40 - over here yep take that image
85:44 - pop that in over here yep
85:48 - right and then take that price and pop
85:51 - it in
85:51 - right there is that right exactly that
85:54 - that's exactly what's going to happen
85:56 - props are basically like arguments in a
86:00 - function
86:01 - right in regular programming it's kind
86:03 - of like that literally
86:04 - yeah think of it as an argument to a
86:06 - function which is why it goes so
86:08 - well so props are props are to
86:10 - components as arguments or to functions
86:13 - yeah think of it that way yeah exactly
86:16 - that probably awful way for most people
86:17 - to think of it but
86:18 - helps me somebody just said oh people
86:21 - are saying wow and
86:22 - sending heart emojis so it must be good
86:24 - they like it
86:25 - that's kind of cool you can see that on
86:27 - facebook
86:28 - nice all right somebody says you guys
86:31 - are making me fall in love with react
86:33 - hey don't forget about yourself
86:36 - don't forget about your mom i'm gonna
86:37 - tell your girlfriend
86:40 - falling in love with react all right
86:43 - let's go here
86:45 - so the next page we have just a small
86:47 - little
86:48 - code snippet showing exactly what cause
86:50 - he said so on the bottom you can see it
86:52 - renders out a hello world component yeah
86:54 - and we're passing
86:55 - the name prop with the value john right
86:58 - yep just like an argument so that's
86:59 - first
87:00 - exactly and the way we use it is we just
87:02 - say props dot name in the actual
87:04 - function so it's super simple guys it's
87:06 - very very simple stuff oh i like it
87:08 - let me actually do this here
87:12 - hey props
87:15 - no so yeah we got drop here and boom
87:18 - name
87:18 - john and then i'll pull that out and go
87:20 - hello john
87:22 - nice yeah so hold up where though
87:25 - is redux so a lot of us know about
87:29 - something called redux and we're always
87:30 - throwing the world around like oh my god
87:32 - should we use redox what the heck is
87:33 - redux and
87:34 - and it kind of gets a bit confusing
87:36 - right i remember when i landed my first
87:37 - job i had no idea even how to code with
87:39 - redux
87:40 - so my first year on your first job
87:43 - yeah this was me on my first job i just
87:45 - said to him i was like i really don't
87:46 - know how to do redux
87:47 - they're like can you code react i said
87:49 - yep they said well you learn it on the
87:50 - job
87:51 - so that's one thing i want to tell you
87:52 - guys don't freak out if it scares you
87:54 - too because i was also scared of redux
87:57 - so all it is guys is a data layer so
88:01 - a data layer so what we have is we
88:03 - showed you guys about props we showed
88:05 - you guys
88:06 - how you can pass props into different
88:08 - components
88:09 - but what tends to happen is sometimes
88:12 - you need for example a user right so
88:14 - let's say you log in as a user
88:15 - in a component and let's say that
88:17 - component is at the top of the tree
88:19 - right so let's say that login component
88:21 - is at the top of the tree
88:22 - and let's say you need it in a bunch of
88:24 - different components hold on i'll help
88:25 - you out here give me one second
88:27 - so let's go i'm gonna do something so
88:30 - let's
88:30 - go here so login component right there
88:33 - yeah
88:33 - so let's say that's the login component
88:35 - right now loads of different
88:38 - um props underneath right are going to
88:42 - basically maybe require that user that
88:44 - you logged in with right
88:45 - yeah which means that you kind of have
88:47 - to like pass the user down the tree
88:50 - right got it you have to con so imagine
88:53 - at the bottom if we had something like
88:55 - um a message okay message component so
88:59 - i'll just write
89:00 - m here for that so message component now
89:03 - the message probably needs the user
89:05 - right yep exactly so then what does it
89:08 - need to do it needs to go
89:09 - all the way back up there to get the
89:11 - user information from the login
89:13 - so that's what you would want it to do
89:15 - but in reality
89:17 - without a data layer you have to pass
89:19 - the login
89:20 - down that tree all the way through the
89:23 - component through another component
89:25 - through another component until you get
89:27 - to that message
89:28 - so will your code look like a lot of
89:30 - like you know like dot
89:32 - dist and dot something else and
89:35 - yeah you're gonna have to pass the user
89:37 - as a prop down to the next component and
89:39 - then down to the next one
89:41 - and we call that problem prop drilling
89:43 - yeah right and
89:44 - as soon as you see prop drilling you
89:46 - just like stop coding and you say okay i
89:48 - need to implement something
89:50 - like a data layer which is basically
89:52 - going to wrap it and do what kazi just
89:54 - sort of explained earlier which is you
89:56 - just want to be able to pull it
89:58 - straight from the login exactly so
90:01 - basically what a data layer allows us to
90:03 - do
90:03 - is just have it in one place where
90:05 - everybody can access it right like where
90:07 - you can access it directly
90:10 - so instead of having this like crappy
90:13 - structured structure you just have one
90:15 - data layer
90:16 - and that has all the information that
90:18 - you need so then for example when the
90:21 - user needs the login information instead
90:24 - of having to go
90:24 - this prop drilling route you just go and
90:28 - grab the user's
90:29 - information from right there exactly
90:32 - think of it as a global
90:34 - variable right it's a global store like
90:37 - it just sits on top it wraps the entire
90:39 - app
90:40 - and what you can do is when you log in
90:41 - you can push the user in so you can just
90:43 - throw the user inside that global store
90:45 - and then if you need it in the messages
90:46 - you can just go ahead and grab it but
90:48 - you don't have to do any of this
90:49 - properly
90:50 - i got i got an idea of how we can
90:52 - explain it in a simple way
90:54 - um so for example right um
90:57 - when i hit add to basket is this being
91:00 - added to data layer that i added this
91:02 - product it is being added to the data
91:05 - yes okay so what we're gonna do
91:07 - is as soon as i clicked add to basket
91:09 - right this is what i want you to imagine
91:11 - that happened
91:12 - um holy crap this is heavy on my
91:15 - computer
91:17 - so as soon as i hit add to basket this
91:19 - is the data layer
91:20 - and it just got added in there okay yep
91:24 - exactly um so now this is i'm just going
91:27 - to call it tls that just means
91:29 - the lean startup so we're just gonna do
91:32 - tls here okay and yeah i got the pricing
91:35 - and everything of it and it's in the
91:37 - data layer and have access to it
91:39 - okay yeah now let's just add one more
91:42 - thing as well maybe i'll add in that um
91:44 - the kenwood mix stand the red the red
91:47 - thing right
91:49 - yep um and for that i'll just call it k
91:53 - um kms kenwood mixtape okay
91:57 - okay so so now what happens when i click
92:00 - on if i hit add to basket now those two
92:02 - are added so when i go to basket
92:03 - those are in the data layer and that's
92:05 - how it knows about them but if i remove
92:07 - from basket it'll actually kick it out
92:09 - of the data layer right
92:11 - exactly boom yeah when i hit remove from
92:13 - basket now the
92:14 - kms is gone it's out of the data layer
92:18 - now i want you guys to pay attention to
92:19 - what cars you just said because
92:21 - we have that data layer now and what we
92:24 - can do is you see in the header
92:26 - right now we have the basket icon right
92:28 - we can use this data layout these
92:30 - objects in the data
92:31 - for so many different purposes right so
92:34 - we can actually go ahead and have it
92:36 - inside that's why it says one
92:37 - next to the basket because it uses the
92:39 - information from the data to calculate
92:41 - what's in the basket
92:42 - we also have it's kind of over what
92:44 - we've drawn but it also shows you the
92:46 - total
92:47 - and that is also pulled from the data
92:49 - there so these these different
92:50 - components
92:51 - aren't getting prop drilled all this
92:53 - stuff is just kind of grabbing things
92:54 - from the data they're saying all right
92:56 - let me add this up
92:57 - yeah so it's a very very nice way of
92:59 - coding it's very nice yep and it makes
93:01 - everything really fast and that way
93:04 - you just move fast without any kind of
93:05 - like nightmare issues with prop drilling
93:08 - exactly okay so if that doesn't make
93:11 - full sense
93:12 - don't worry because it probably took
93:13 - sonny like
93:15 - two years after he was doing it to kind
93:18 - of make sense
93:19 - yeah and you know what guys i'll tell
93:21 - you a story like i literally landed my
93:23 - first job i wasn't sure
93:24 - about how to code and react and i
93:26 - literally was on the train
93:28 - just watching youtube videos right and
93:30 - it was it yeah
93:31 - exactly don't be afraid the reality of
93:34 - this is gonna be
93:35 - you're not gonna understand any of this
93:37 - stuff but you're gonna be
93:39 - doing it exactly uh and that's
93:43 - oh that's what you want like you'll
93:44 - we'll show it to you and then through
93:45 - pattern recognition you'll be able to
93:47 - execute it even though if you don't
93:48 - completely know
93:49 - underlying what's happening then it'll
93:50 - make sense at some point all right
93:52 - exactly
93:53 - so introducing the react context api
93:56 - what it does is it just makes
93:58 - redux which is a very powerful
94:00 - technology that all
94:01 - react developers or developers in
94:03 - general should know about but it makes
94:05 - that
94:05 - really easy and it's the way that we
94:07 - recommend that you guys actually learn
94:10 - um like this is should be your first
94:12 - baby step before you get into redux
94:14 - and it's still extremely powerful the
94:16 - both patterns are the same
94:18 - it's just the react context the api is a
94:20 - super easy way to learn the pattern
94:22 - then you can move on to redux in a very
94:23 - easy way exactly
94:25 - so let's move forward and remember it's
94:28 - like context api
94:29 - acts as a global store okay this is
94:32 - something we touched
94:33 - and now your apps are now basically put
94:36 - into beast
94:37 - mode and what is this so this is exactly
94:41 - kind of like once we had that
94:42 - once we achieved once we are able to use
94:44 - things like the react context api
94:46 - we can actually go ahead and build the
94:48 - powerful apps like we showed you earlier
94:49 - so the netflix clone
94:51 - the facebook clone the airbnb clone the
94:53 - amazon clone
94:54 - all of those things are possible because
94:56 - we can use
94:57 - the react context api and have that data
94:59 - layer and have that extra
95:01 - layer of functionality to our app
95:03 - absolutely
95:04 - and then you can build things like
95:06 - facebook clone or airbnb
95:07 - clone or the amazon clone we're going to
95:09 - actually show you how to build tomorrow
95:11 - with full back-end functionality and
95:13 - tomorrow we're going to be covering
95:14 - firebase as well
95:15 - so what is firebase and why is it so
95:17 - useful for a react developer and we're
95:19 - going to touch base on in a little bit
95:20 - because it also allows you to
95:22 - host your app online all right and
95:24 - firebase is honestly the easiest way to
95:26 - go
95:27 - and it allows you to scale to 100
95:29 - million users if 100 million users got
95:31 - onto your app because it's google
95:32 - so google knows how to scale to it makes
95:34 - your life a lot easier
95:36 - cloud firestore and write this down guys
95:39 - because if this is a lot that's okay
95:41 - we're here to just over deliver on the
95:43 - value
95:44 - make sure you take notes on it so then
95:46 - it's there for you
95:48 - but cloud firestore is essentially a and
95:50 - by the way are you guys with us still i
95:52 - just want to make sure you guys are
95:53 - still
95:53 - with us so drop it in the comments below
95:55 - because i want to make sure all of your
95:56 - guys energy levels are
95:58 - always high because we're watching your
96:00 - chat and looking at your comments so
96:02 - hardeep chanil yamna talha
96:04 - shantanu we want you guys to be
96:06 - energized and pumped up in peak state
96:09 - because as time starts to go
96:11 - your energy levels will start to go down
96:13 - so make sure
96:14 - that's what i'm talking about dude look
96:16 - as soon as you said that look at the
96:18 - response
96:18 - everyone yeah there we go so we want
96:21 - that energy level to start
96:22 - rising up guys and we want you back
96:24 - jonathan says i'm with you pablo says
96:26 - here we are yum that says let's
96:28 - go epic guys
96:31 - keep that energy high because then you
96:33 - are gonna remember
96:34 - all of this information all right so
96:36 - it's gonna actually help you out
96:37 - tremendously
96:39 - all right so cloud firestore real time
96:41 - database what does this mean
96:44 - you will have a database that allows you
96:45 - to store stuff so then when you refresh
96:47 - things don't vanish
96:48 - simple as that the same reason why you
96:50 - go to instagram not all of your posts
96:52 - are deleted
96:52 - you go the next day they're there and
96:54 - firebase and cloud firestore is the
96:56 - easiest way to actually host your app
96:59 - uh moving forward it allows you user
97:02 - authentication so with your app guys how
97:04 - sick is it gonna be wouldn't it be sick
97:06 - guys for you
97:07 - if you had google authentication on your
97:09 - app or you had facebook authentication
97:11 - or twitter or github
97:13 - it would make you look so badass and
97:15 - professional right because
97:16 - people come on to your app and they're
97:17 - like hey i can sign in with google
97:19 - that's dope
97:21 - charlene says you guys are great thanks
97:22 - for the knowledge they are
97:24 - energized and pumped up i'm loving it
97:26 - guys now cloud-based functions sunny
97:28 - touch on this
97:29 - so this is what you need essentially a
97:32 - lot of people ask like oh do i need to
97:33 - know node.js or express and things like
97:35 - that
97:36 - so with cloud functions it provides a
97:38 - scalable really easy way
97:40 - to still be able to use node.js and have
97:42 - like those backend functions that we
97:44 - need
97:45 - but they're in a serverless architecture
97:47 - which is so dope
97:48 - super scalable and we're going to be
97:50 - using cloud functions
97:52 - to go ahead and incorporate and develop
97:54 - that payment processing that we spoke
97:56 - about earlier
97:57 - so we're going to have stripe
97:58 - functionality which is going to be
97:59 - powered by cloud functions
98:00 - exactly they're very very it allows you
98:02 - to learn server less architectures too
98:04 - instead of monolithic apps this is the
98:07 - way forward for developers this is
98:09 - actually the best way in my opinion to
98:11 - do things moving forward
98:13 - so you learn serverless functionality
98:15 - miriam says of course i would never
98:17 - miss the golden information and she goes
98:20 - i even skipped dinner for this
98:21 - so no regrets good nice
98:25 - that's kind of the level you want to be
98:26 - at firebase also allows you to have full
98:28 - storage of your media
98:30 - and things like that and it'll optimize
98:32 - images and all sorts of media or videos
98:34 - that you throw on it
98:36 - um and it allows you to grow your
98:38 - business or do a b testing
98:40 - and notifications and all that good
98:42 - stuff
98:43 - the best part about firebase is what
98:45 - sunny
98:47 - it's completely free guys it's fast free
98:50 - easy to use we say free it's free up to
98:52 - a very generous limit which you guys
98:54 - aren't going to need to use at this
98:55 - point
98:56 - so guys completely free completely free
98:59 - completely free so let's go forward so
99:02 - what's happening tomorrow
99:03 - tomorrow what are you guys doing drop it
99:06 - in the comments below i want to see if

99:12 - building the amazon
99:14 - clone with full front end full back-end
99:16 - functionality
99:17 - you're gonna be able to accept card
99:19 - payments that's gonna be nice
99:21 - you're gonna be able to host it online
99:23 - and put it on your portfolio

105:11 - coding boot camp
105:12 - so for that you have to participate in
105:14 - the facebook group for the react
105:16 - challenge now remember you're going to
105:18 - need to update

105:21 - sonny sango when i look at it it should
105:23 - say your name
105:24 - we're going to be actually judging this
105:25 - pretty critically and then going
105:27 - tomorrow we're actually going to be
105:28 - going over some of your portfolios
105:30 - and showing it off in front of everybody
105:32 - so make sure that it looks good
105:34 - so when other people see it it's
105:35 - representative of you and your work
105:39 - exactly update your experience on it
105:41 - update your
105:42 - description on it screenshot your
105:46 - portfolio once you have updated it
105:48 - and then what we want you to do is
105:50 - upload it as a comment people are saying
105:52 - yes maroot is like the kind of value you
105:54 - guys are delivering is insane
105:56 - miriam says i would love to and now i'm
105:58 - super excited to customize it
105:59 - oh that's sick that's actually really
106:01 - exciting
106:02 - yeah allow says this is an amazing
106:04 - portfolio from sunny
106:06 - so make sure you drop it in the comments
106:09 - and
106:09 - upload it to the facebook post we're
106:11 - gonna make a facebook post
106:12 - and you're gonna drop your homework as a
106:14 - image and then make sure you customize
106:17 - it so if you innovate on this portfolio
106:20 - the better you make it or maybe the more
106:22 - you innovate that's how you can get
106:23 - extra points
106:24 - so one it has to be good and something
106:27 - that you can show your potential
106:29 - employer
106:30 - two because if you innovate we're gonna
106:32 - give you extra points on it
106:34 - yep and then we've actually created a
106:36 - form for you guys you guys to go ahead
106:38 - so there's two things you guys are gonna
106:39 - need to do
106:40 - you just need to fill out that form and
106:41 - then you basically put in the link
106:43 - to your portfolio you put in the uh
106:46 - we've shown you in the video how you can
106:47 - actually deploy it as well
106:48 - yep and then we want that cause he said
106:50 - upload the actual screenshot as a
106:52 - comment in the facebook post uh post
106:54 - so that's really important guys yeah but
106:56 - do both because
106:57 - the facebook one allows us to engage
106:59 - with you and other people to see your
107:01 - work
107:02 - and engage with you as well i mean you
107:04 - also never know there's some people who
107:06 - could be
107:06 - employers looking through these comments
107:09 - and sometimes they might reach out to
107:11 - you and potentially give you
107:12 - opportunity to work with them it's that
107:14 - crazy exactly because there are some
107:16 - people who are
107:17 - giving jobs in this group because they
107:19 - see everybody wants to become a
107:20 - developer
107:22 - exactly um and we are going to be
107:24 - opening the doors to
107:25 - profit with javascript in a few days and
107:28 - we're going to be releasing it at the
107:30 - best
107:31 - price possible because in a week or two
107:34 - weeks
107:35 - it's going to go up in price because so
107:37 - many students have told us
107:39 - that this program is worth more than
107:41 - their 10
107:42 - 000 or even their 15 000 online coding
107:44 - boot camp
107:46 - so once the price goes up for this and
107:48 - we close the doors
107:49 - then one the price is never going to
107:51 - come back down
107:52 - and two we're not going to be opening
107:54 - the doors to this program
107:56 - for many months later so make sure
108:00 - that when we open the doors to this in
108:01 - about a week you
108:03 - show up and what i say to make it even
108:06 - easier is for september 13th
108:09 - mark it on your calendars because that's
108:12 - exactly when we're going to be opening
108:13 - up the doors to this program
108:15 - september 13th all right and that's
108:18 - gonna be i think around
108:20 - 11 a.m pacific as well so make sure you
108:23 - show up to that and it's going to be
108:25 - really really um
108:26 - it's going to be really big all right
108:29 - so let's move forward now more for your

what is your what is the reason why you're here today right so we have serena j pierce she currently works in property auctions in the uk and she joined pwj so she's actually part of the community already and she wants to push herself to the next level guys so let us know right now as we go through these comments right now let us know your why in the comment section right now why are you here

below so as you're here the more actively you participate the more results you're going to be likely to get so wherever you're watching this make sure you drop down below what is your why and don't just give me a reason with money though that can be helpful but give me your real why so somebody says i want to become my own boss somebody says i want to make a name for myself through coding and impact people somebody says i'm passionate about coding and arturo says i'm already starting a react bootcamp and i want to learn way more so i love that and serena actually says i found clever programmer in youtube and started following their bills then i joined profit with javascript and now i want to push myself to the next level she says i'm 39 years old and female so not the most represented group in tech that is a pretty underrepresented group but i'm up for the ride as i've had great fun so far with these guys much love and good luck to all so coding is really for everyone right it doesn't matter what your age is or what your gender is you can learn it and you can pick it up and you can become great at it exactly we have a lovely another comment here on the next live

real fantastic that's a great why all right so let's keep going kundan says i want to do what i love which is code and i don't want to do customer service jobs anymore and codingbox says hopefully learning something resourceful would help me to afford living by myself manu says i want to be able to get better job offers as well as offer my services as a freelancer yo and yamna who's an amazing

talking about the people who are getting jobs take a look at this this is uh sumit who actually reached out to sunny and he says i landed a sixfigure job at mathworks as a web application developer i started watching your videos on your channel like three months ago i built the netflix and spotify clone and got a good response on linkedin and he goes later i received this interview call i cleared the initial coding rounds and later during a demo i showcased them these clone along with my other projects and trust me they were super impressed i further cracked six rigorous technical rounds and clever programmers react.js tutorials played a major role in clearing my basic on context apis redux react routers etc and yesterday while i was building whatsapp merge with you guys i received a call from the hr who congratulated me for my name awesome hey we got the crowd cheering in the back yeah i remember getting this dude when as soon as i got this message i was like holy crap afterwards my response was insane i was just like holy [ __ ] it blew my mind seeing that it's so so nice to see that absolutely amazing and then he goes i fixed it and he goes finding a new dream role during my pandemic is insane thank you clever programmers so guys we absolutely have your back and this is a crazy thing right you could see the world in different ways you could look at it as everything is contracting getting worse there are no jobs are there people out there who are doing maybe some things that are more strategic and are able to get jobs in the meantime right exactly exactly guys flip the situation make it your friend yep and actually you somebody else also reached out to you right recently just today you actually told me and um yeah and he said very excited so yeah talk me what is this i'm looking at yeah so i got this right before the live as well so it was not long ago and he said very excited to share with you that i built the i built my confidence from you guys and he landed at 1 000 project and guys it's just insane like and that's not even the first time we've seen that like it just blows my mind every time it's sometimes it's 250 sometimes it's a thousand sometimes with six figures it's insane like but seeing that from you guys it's just like it makes everything worth it for us absolutely so let's keep going on the value bombs that we have prepared for you now guys last five day javascript challenge that we had done was absolutely epic we had a hundred and thirteen thousand comments from you guys and we had over six thousand viewers at the same time watching the live stream so it was nuts and we had people from all around the world building amazing apps like yasen who built the google maps for object vibhavi jen we had reihan we had jonel we had ava aravinda and we had all of these people and then we had all we documented their experience so jen said after that challenge that my future looks bright to be able to do freelancing jessica was like i'm ready to take on the world david was like already started to build my own website after day four of the live training dean was like i want to become a successful front and developer to provide for my daughter carl says this was a transformative experience i did it and absolutely amazing i went over the prizes with you guys and these were the winners from our last uh the first challenge we did actually this year so jessica won first place and then we had second and third place that went out now what i do want to let you guys know is after these five days are over we are going to be opening the doors to our uh flagship course called profit with javascript it's literally one of the best course says on the planet when it comes to learning javascript learning react and then using that to be able to get a job exactly guys it's it's completely valuepacked and before you guys even ask because we always get this question is it for beginners guys yes you can go from absolutely zero experience all the way up until landing your clients and we actually hold your hand the entire way and we have loads of examples like dina let's talk about dina kazi so dina had actually lost her job due to covid and here is dina right she lost her job due to kovitt she's a mother who wants to learn coding so she can actually help provide for her daughter she joined the five day javascript developer challenge last month and here's her results four weeks since joining this fiveday javascript challenge right she ended up winning this competition over here which is like at the impact foundation for women in tech in macedonia she came third in the last five day developer challenge she led a talk in the conference and she came first a week after she won in a coding hackathon and she landed her first javascript developer job literally that same month and just to add the cherry on the top she's now a lead developer guys oh yeah um so yeah guys a lot of people you see constantly they're losing their jobs but they're still able to make an income the same thing happened with you know he jose reached out to us and he was like hey i lost my job in january february and then i started learning how to code and now this experience has shown him that having one source of income is a bad idea so now look he's looking to turn this entire negative into a positive so let me ask you this entire situation that's happening in the world right now is this a situation that is a crisis a problem or is it an opportunity and let me ask you a better question are you willing to turn it into an opportunity because at the end of the day if you decide not to do anything with it nothing will actually happen with it right at the end of the day it really just comes down to you so what's going to be your decision and kind of you have to just decide and commit to it we can there be there to help you and maybe show you the way but the work that you actually have to put in is hard and that's going to be on you exactly and guys we're not talking 50 we're not talking 60 you have to give this your 110 effort if you want to make this actually a true opportunity for yourself so guys just want to say one thing right behind making all this happen we have this amazing team at clever programmer so this is everybody who's behind the scenes that makes all this work so you see sunny over here me nas frankie isabel everybody right these are the people that actually make this happen so if you guys could just show some love for everybody here that would be fantastic if you're watching this on facebook smash that like button if you're watching this on youtube smash that like button just send love and good vibes to the team because it definitely helps everybody get in a better mindset with that said let's continue all right so now yeah let's get it go ahead so great i thought you were muted let's go oh yeah yeah so greg ended up landing a paying client even during this covet craziness inside our profit with javascript course and actually we'll come back to some of these and frank ramos was actually a recent one right that on the live stream it was nuts what happened so frank actually built the spotify clone so if you guys built that with us let us know in the comments but he built the spotify clone right and then he reached out and frank's a dedicated viewer guys frank's ever always in our live streams he's always watching but he reached out to us donated a hundred dollars because he landed a sixfigure consulting project for sonos so many of you guys might know who sonos is it's an insane speaker brand a premium speaker brand and now he's working with sonos and what's he doing quasi he's actually building out their radio station product so they are having him use react and react native to actually build it out which is pretty freaking dope so that tells you how much demand there is for these things and how valuable this is for everybody to learn it's kind of crazy that on youtube you have 3 700 concurrent viewers absolutely insane it's insane mindblowing stuff too here's nasir iqbal who are who's our 14 year old student from pakistan and guys again the reason why we're showing this to you right is to show what is possible because nobody shows this stuff right look at any channel on javascript or react or whatever everybody can teach you technical stuff and that's not hard you guys are looking at our channel we're providing four to six hour long technical bills after build every single day the technical stuff is not hard we want to show you now what's possible because some of you are either developers looking to go to the next level or some of you are beginners looking to get your first job i think it's very important you see what is possible so nasir was on my coaching call and he goes i was talking to him and he's like hey i just got a client and i'm like oh [ __ ] i'm like did you get paid and he goes yeah just last week i cleared fourteen hundred dollars hey let's go damn dude what was crazy was he was almost like not happy about it he was like he wanted more i'm like nasir shut the [ __ ] up i'm like put your head down and do the work you're 14 in pakistan like that is insane and then he starts laughing and he's like oh yeah he goes yeah he he's like you know my dad makes like ten thousand in a whole year so i made like you know his twomonth salary in in like a week yeah and he got paid i actually had him i had him inside of my coaching call as well and i remember he was like yeah i've landed a client before and i was like yo what like you i was like what the wait hold up just run me through it it's mindblowing that was insane and i was like yo represent because i'm from pakistan too you know so i was like nice and he landed a client and he developed an ecommerce website and i remember he was asking me and he was talking to me he was actually using python and django to build it out but the most important thing is that it's possible for you guys it doesn't matter where you are in the world it's possible and you can do this and you can get clients regardless of if you're united states tunisia pakistan ireland it doesn't matter so you know he's like why not so i'm working on an ecommerce project with the client that i'm using django as a backend and react as a frontend so look at that even with python he's using react right and he's charging him 20 an hour and he was working 10 hours a day and that's how he was able to achieve that goal so now here are the seven really important habits sunny and what are some of these habits and why are they important so guys obviously it's going to take a lot of hard work patience is huge because sometimes when you're debugging you need to give it like a bit a lot of time people give it an hour and they kind of quit no it's not going to cut it if you want to make a real difference you've got to give this your time you you've got to be part of a team doing this stuff by yourself can be difficult and most importantly from these things guys like communication learning taking that initiative is important but honestly just have fun with the process yes and why is that so important quasi if you don't have fun and you get into things like you're trying to just do hard work you're gonna quit you're gonna quit nonstop i see this happen so much even people who are you know they're like so focused on the educational system and they're going for their masters and whatever so they're very disciplined with their work ethic but they don't enjoy it they don't get curious they don't try to learn new things what happens is then even when they get a job they hate it and then they ultimately quit so if there's one thing i can push for me coding always felt like i was playing a video game and it always felt wrong that i was being paid for it i swear to god it felt like i found a way to play video games all day and have so much fun and there was somebody silly enough in their brain to pay me for it that's so true dude i never thought of it like that it's so true yeah because because everyone would be like i just finished a hard day at work and i'll be like well i was just coding all day and i kind of got paid and you got paid a lot you know you probably got paid more than that and so yeah it's like man it's pretty ridiculous that how much fun and excitement you can have while you're coding so if it doesn't feel like that try to make it feel like that that's why i don't sometimes recommend people going to college to learn it because so much is shoved down your throat there's no room for curiosity and when there's no room for curiosity you're very less likely to learn exactly so hard work of course is required patience is required team cooperation communication learning taking initiative but the ones that i want to touch on of course fun make sure that's there learn like nonstop and forever that's going to be one of the keys and then taking initiative yeah and guys and just like you right greg who's one of our students a prophet with javascript who we shared with you earlier who landed clients even during covet um he shows up to these live training calls just like you are here today right so i'm up top and we got greg over here showing up like a champion he's also a third degree black belt in taekwondo i don't know if you knew that that's insane i didn't know that no insane and even when our javascript instructor nas is running his epic training calls with like 25 or 50 plus people i don't know how many people we're getting now pwj calls but greg is showing up still to those so there's nas there's greg so if there's one thing you can take from him is make sure you show up every single day that's how he became the third degree black belt in jiu jitsu that's how he became a surveyor and he started doing like contracting physical labor and work and now he wants to switch to coding doesn't know anything about coding is having a hard time learning it but now he's actually starting to land clients for coding which is crazy insane so at this point you might be wondering who is this guy and who's this other guy yeah all right all right i don't know are you wondering maybe we're just making it up yeah i mean like maybe you guys don't know who we are right yeah so um so at clever programmer we all we hit 767 000 subscribers thanks to you guys it's a privilege and an honor to be able to serve you i'm rafikaze that goofy looking guy over there from pakistan um i came here humble beginnings didn't really have anything didn't know a letter of english was like bullied for years um and then i tried to kind of go to high school didn't really fit in and um was much of an outcast but then i kind of discovered coding on my own and just started having fun with it and i thought there must be another way than what my brothers were doing and it just seemed very soul sucking so i wanted to do something on my own i discovered coding and i was like damn coding feels like coding literally feels like having a genie and being able to speak to a genie except that you have unlimited wishes not just three the only catch is you have to learn how to speak to the genie the only catch is you have to actually learn how to use react or python or javascript to speak to it and once you do that you literally have infinite powers it's like creating art but people live in that art so like mark zuckerberg's facebook that's his brain when you log into facebook you're entering his brain so it's kind of like fascinating you can just create your own universes so i went into coding purely for the money because my brother told me you can make a lot of money but then i stayed and just fell absolutely in love with it and i kind of even stopped caring about money just because like it was so phenomenal um then at the age of 21 i figured out how to make over a hundred four thousand dollars a year as a freelance developer i even started to get two developers under me that i hired at some point and i would just be at college like playing pool and i would see this stripe payment like come through on my phone like four or five thousand dollars and i would look at it i'd be like what is this i was like but like it would be you know later i got developers that actually started um helping me out and working so it was really amazing to go from a complete beginner to like learning coding getting jobs and getting people and then at some point i decided to start a youtube channel and we ended up you know teaching over hundreds of thousands of students to code um you know was lucky enough to become a millionaire at 25 and learn a lot a lot of hard lessons and failures and went through a lot of pain throughout the way and hopefully just hopefully maybe i can share something with you that might give you value that's really the primary reason that i'm here today um with that said that's me guys and here we got sunny so guys here is the back story behind me so if many of you guys don't know i'm sunny you guys give me a nickname i really like it it's papa react so follows from papa python we got the react code we got a few different names and i followed the system guys so i went a little bit of a different route right i followed the system i went to university i spent money on a degree i did all this stuff i went through the entire process right i thought it would land me the job at the end and then when it finally came to getting the job this is exactly a visual representation of what life did to me it literally slapped me in the face right i was like it's like they stepped on my degree and like it was like it was worth nothing right so i it was a very hard learning point at that point then what i started to do is i started to teach how to code so i was teaching throughout university to make money i started to freelance and then i started to work in different uh industries as a coder and i was lucky enough to make 200 000 by the age of 23. and then what happened 200 000 pounds yeah it was 200 000 pounds uh and that was fruits okay let's go and um yeah like this was this took a lot of like this took a lot of like energy and took a lot of risktaking and a lot of this stuff like it's just things that people will never tell you which is why we we are so passionate here at clever program and we tell you guys things that you just don't hear otherwise like you don't hear the stuff on stack overflow right now we then by 24 it was like i was lucky enough to go and get into a conversation with kazi me and him started talking and before you know it here we are today and we've all built over 20 plus reactions on youtube and it's just insane like we've been able to teach you guys so much and i love and appreciate every single one of you guys and i love the energy you guys give me so if you guys don't know me drop a comment now literally millions of people know you yeah it's really i honestly it's just mindblowing guys and we're just so so humbled and grateful that we can see the progress and the value that we can bring you guys and it's just lifechanging so honestly really appreciate you guys and i am papa react there you go so that's sunny um and then we got your javascript instructor nazari dominsky so in this challenge is going to be mostly sunny and i but nas is over here so maybe nas can pop in and say hello niles you want to come in real quick so what is up everybody hope you guys are doing amazing let's go i was pumped and i almost made out there but i dodged it real quick so he is he's had a privileges to um you know interview with companies like google squarespace twitter khan academy palantir he loves palantir it's the biggest one but he's absolute badass um monster that we got on the team and we were just lucky enough to be able to work with him and every single day he just brings on so much value and even right now behind the scenes he's masterminding so much of the stuff and putting it together it's absolutely unbelievable so um yeah if you guys want to appreciate him and thank him drop it in the comments below and just cheer him up because he's he is an absolute incredible asset on the team and we're lucky to have him so guys who's ready to put in their 100 and play to win because if you are here we want you to be in a position where you're playing to win you're not just here you're like just another video like i'm just gonna watch it on my phone like and those are also the results that are going to be mimicked in your real life you're just going to like kind of your way through life and you don't want to do that right so if you're here and you're ready to play all out 100 drop in the comments below and let us know hey i am ready to play at a hundred percent exactly guys with that said let's go forward um oh devon great that's actually another fascinating one i want to share this with you guys and this happened recently right sunny yeah this happened really recently actually in one of the live streams i think yup so devin oh zachary also says that 200 000 sounds really really good yeah so devin's landed his first sixfigure job as a developer and passed his second round of interviews at google damn and yes that google so i'm just gonna play a little applause for devin here yeah nice dude yeah so absolute beast and uh he's also in profit with javascript here so this guy is amazing and he goes i'm not normally used to posting about myself but i know it's important to share win so i'm sharing mine while i have them first of all i love my new job it's my first six figure job and i'm learning a lot of different things that i don't ever get to practice when i work for smaller companies i've only been working this job for a little over a week but it's awesome second i just got accepted to the second round of interviews with google yes that google i am so pumped when i first joined this group i was working for a momandpop agency doing wordpress sites making like onethird of what i'm making now so around probably 20 or 30 000 a year and i only joined back in june or july is there a correlation i'll let you decide i want to thank everyone in this community for their support because i'm mostly here for the community and it's helped me in a large way nice dude he used to show up on our live streams literally a few weeks ago showing up on our live streams now we probably can't even get a hold of him um so guys we're going to be going deep into building your personal roadmap for making 100k a year as a javascript as a react javascript developer on day five of the live training but for now let's figure out why you want to become a react.js developer sounds good guys all right so with that said let's go so now we're gonna skip over this because this is gonna be like the secret sauce that we're gonna give you guys on the last day and we're gonna show you this like modern javascript developer pyramid of wealth but what i want you to do right now is comment below what are the three things more important to you than money so what are those things comment them below and we're gonna start reading them out i don't know why my facebook is doing this weird thing where like what's today my comments like just keep going up you know enough to keep scrolling down all the time oh you have to scroll all the way to the bottom dude and it'll stick i oh oh we've started to get some things and we've got security learning knowledge peace of mind that's called family a lot of family i see that's nice ah we've got responsibility and happiness that's awesome wow and then this is this is quite hitting one it said food like honestly just food like is it just really to eat put bread on the table us yeah that's one of the main reasons why a lot of us do what we do holy crap somebody gave a 50 donation damn oh yes i earlier okay that was sick yeah susan says one my other half two my mom sadly my dad passed away and three peace and harmony that is a beautiful reason to be coding zachary says freedom to experience new things freedom to support friends and family and the ability to change lives through future technologies we have uh ahmed sites and helping my family because i enjoy it and number three to prove my to improve on myself nice yup we got nicholas over here and he says making an impact gaining knowledge and supporting my family that's beautiful i love how much these everybody like loves their family and how much they're focused on yeah i love that i mean guys you're not going to be judged for whatever your goal is but that's a really good goal to have because they'll ground you when your goals are when your goals are jacked like that and your why is strong think of it like you know you see a tree underneath the tree you got all these roots that go so deep that you will never see but that's actually how the tree is anchored up and cannot be broken those values that you have in your life the humility the groundedness those are your roots that's what grounds you and makes you strong so even before you start becoming a react developer it's important that you get your roots solid and your why is powerful because that's you know besides just it being fun that's what's going to really get you going through that exactly now another thing we want you to comment below is here guys we're making your personal roadmap so the more you answer this the more helpful it is going to be for you and we're also going to be looking at your comments so if you guys are engaging that's how we're likely to then pick the winner for the challenge and the only way you can engage and be participating in it is if you're on the facebook group if you're on youtube you can't participate in the challenge so make sure you click the link below in the description join the facebook group and jump on now guys what can making money as a react javascript developer help you achieve in your life so now let's get to what money can help you do and start dropping it in the comments below exactly so we want to definitely see that so sunny like what was it for you let's just talk about you for a second what let's do it yeah so for you when you were making money what what did it help you with so it was actually honestly it was it was a tough situation that i was put in at one point where like money was a big issue right so like money for a lot of us is a big issue so i needed a way of making money and now coding was just there it was a it was a situation where i always sort of enjoyed something right but when you enjoy something you don't really think that you can make an income from it right but like we just like it completely flipped it on its head and i started to make money from that and honestly the main thing for me was i used to see my mom work so hard right so she used to work so hard to provide for us so i wanted to basically be able to pay and pay like and return the favor somehow so for me that was a huge why that was a huge why it wasn't to buy a fancy car it wasn't to buy a fancy house it was simply to repay for what somebody had done for me and that that was actually my main driving factor so whenever i was debugging whenever i was sat there for hours and my code wouldn't work i'd be thinking in the back of my head that look some like my mom went through this a lot harder and it's my job pretty much the main person who's also there to help her yeah exactly so you know because i know somebody in the chat earlier was like hey my dad passed away so she had to be there for her mom right so like you have to you had to step up as that big son and be able to actually support and help your mom out and it's funny because for me a lot of the reason why i started coding and pushing myself so hard and didn't just want a ninetofive job was actually because of my mom so nice a lot of us it's actually like that's one of the reasons yomna says supporting my family and starting a business he almost says buy me a house um louis says i think money can help me get a lot of free time and be happy um yeah so so angie says support family be a better person and show my kids they can achieve their goals guys these are really fast amazing reasons that you guys are dropping in and i really think it's going to help you in your careers as a developer so and and thank you for continuing to play all out all right so you guys already dropped this below you guys talked about financial freedom supporting family having more time to spend with your loved ones now here's the next question that we have for you because this is again going to help you decide your ultimate career as a react.js developer and what you're looking for so do you want to work freelance or do you want to work fulltime i think this is an important distinction that you have to make because here's what i'll say right i think a lot of it depends on your personality type are you more risk averse or are you more risk tolerant for example if you are maybe more riskaverse and you don't want to take a lot of risk you will want a fulltime job that's just one example maybe if you want to take more risk you want freelancing um here's another thing do you care about having a bigger upside or do you care about having like a bigger safety net so if you want a bigger safety net go for a fulltime job if you want a higher upside maybe freelancing so both of them can be very fruitful there's no right or wrong answer it really depends on your personality so i think you have had experience with both because you have worked for really big companies you've worked sunny has worked for tesco which is essentially a walmart in uk and he worked as a software developer right there so yeah yeah talk to me about you know free dance and fulltime what are the benefits and maybe just some of your own personal story with it too yeah so honestly what i would say is for me it was a lot about security right i needed some some solid security some secure income coming in every month so the route of going down the fulltime route worked for me really well now you start to hit a bit of a roof when that happens right so you yes you get much better you have a lot of mentors that you can look to you can improve your skills as a developer but you start to reach a point well at least i did i started to reach a point where i wanted to push my income i wanted to be able to say i can handle more so what i did is actually combine the two and a lot of people never think that's a possibility i used to freelance in my spare times on the weekends after work i would take on jobs freelance and then you actually started to build up and i was doing that for quite a while until i kind of would jump between jobs and i would kind of push my income as i did it now what i would say is i did go at 1.4 freelance and the one thing that i will tell you is yes you raised the roof as to your potential income but you're also dealing with not just one boss but several bosses now so there's lots of pros there's lots of cons like cars you you what did you do when you were sort of coming up as a developer was it more sort of the freelance route was it more the job and how did you find that so i have actually in my entire life never had a fulltime job oh nice yeah ever yeah so for example when i was 15 i started teaching people chess and started freelancing literally with chess and i think in when i was 15 i hit probably like 20 000 that year and then when i was 16 i was doing chess and i think i sk i skilled chess up to like i think 60 000 that year and then at 17 i was like still doing chess and scaled it up and then around 19 or 20 is when i started really coding my experience with coding is i went the freelancing route because that is what i was familiar with and i personally enjoyed it a lot because one is you have multiple bosses but then two it's also that you have multiple jobs so you have like leverage for example you know if i just really didn't like working with one of them i could leave or i had more leverage to negotiate so for me because i'm very risk tolerant i just personally enjoyed that more i'm sure if i actually got a highpaying fulltime job i am 100 000 sure that i would have taken it 100 000 sure but i think when i was doing that i had such little experience that i don't think anybody would give me a fulltime job but like i was just hustling and getting freelancing jobs left and right literally three months into my coding experience i started like applying for jobs for interviews for um teaching people coding and i started making my income like teaching people coding and so i'm like literally if i can teach somebody hello world and somebody wants me to teach them like how for loops work and how to solve basic problems like fizzbuzz as long as i'm adding value to their life and they're happy paying me 35 an hour 40 an hour i'm happy because i'm i'm i'm more i've always been more obsessed with forget about what you think forget about what i think what can bring somebody else value yeah and i just want to do that as much as i can and if you think that i'm bringing you 35 of value or 25 of value and you're paying me that that's great i will take that money and i just re i would reinvest it into my skills meaning i would hire a react developer i would hire like you know and when i say hire i mean like literally go on platforms like codementor or whatever and like pay by the hour so they teach me react yeah spend all my money like building up my skill set so my experience i agree i agree with that dude i just want to add one thing to that i so exactly what cars you said kind of focus about your sort of value that you're going to get deliver right and then what one thing i think it was gary v said this is a 33 rule and i always coach this rule right you should spend the 33 of your time teaching somebody who's slightly below your level right whether it be like you're teaching somebody you're coaching somebody whatever it is and you can do that at any level guys when we teach that in the course uh and to spend a third of your time with somebody above whether it be like taking a freelance job that's higher than you or maybe like taking on a permanent position and then a third of your time with a job that you've maybe hustled to get or client you've hustled to get but you're just spending your time doing it and that will put you in a position where you're kind of between me and qazi and i kind of feel that that's the ultimate way of kind of boosting your growth as a developer yeah i definitely think it's the fastest way i have yet to see a faster way uh that works for most people um somebody in the comments dropped uh his name was amer yeah and he was like i've been teaching chess two for the last five years damn oh nice that is awesome that is so cool chess is a beautiful way to develop your mind yeah i love that people are talking about chess that's pretty cool jalo says freelance is way better if you care about your time and as quasi said a risk taker some people are saying fulltime job is the route that they want to go ready and says i still think fulltime is better and guys again both ways are good pick one and then that's and start with that right and then see how you like it april says i'd want to start out full time and freelance on the side once i'm established freelance for life that's a freaking great way to go too and guys listen to what cars you said at the end of it like start right there was a key there literally just start there is always going to be this debate up do i do freelance do i do just start your journey right now today like if you haven't already yeah and it's important because check this out right here we got julius and hopefully you guys can read what this says here i'll try to maybe zoom in but julia says my win for this week is receiving a job offer as a software programmer i went through over 20 interviews during past six months every time i got close to getting a job the position was put on hold because of covet 19. i keep pushing forward even though i kept getting rejected that's thanks all that helped with advice along the way this is just the beginning getting my foot in the door i'm going to continue learning freelancing from this great program this course helped with sharpening the foundation needed to get hired thanks that's awesome dude this is awesome this is somebody inside profit with javascript and they are applying nonstop and guess what this is the guy that's actually going to get you know the job this is the guy who's going to be able to do it just nonstop and we want i want to show you also how much hard work is required behind the scenes so this is awesome elizabeth says um i missed it but she basically yeah i yeah i don't know why my facebook is just being weird it just keeps going crazy but um okay guys so this is great uh ultimately is gonna be your preference between the two pick one all right and like i said start all right let's go forward so now why react js now top tech companies guys in the world are using javascript in react.js so you got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay tesla groupon netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal and the list goes on and what's this sunny so here guys we have the popularity and this is on uh i believe it's uh is this this is stack overflow right guys if you can see the most popular language right now and it's not by a little bit it's by far is javascript right so react is obviously a library inside of javascript so by knowing javascript and also i hear a lot of people say i want to be do i become full stack do i become back in front and javascript is both right so that's why that's another reason for its popularity but yeah as you can see it's the most popular uh language garyvee would love it because his answer to everything is always both both yeah exactly both do more i wonder what would happen if i gave gary v like uh three like multiple choice but with three things like should i do a b or c i think he would still be like do both [Laughter] he just disregard exactly what he said i love getting but the best the best thing is dude with javascript you can do both you can do web apps and you can do native apps yep exactly yeah and what type of so yeah you could do web apps you can do ios android apps like tesla was you know we have tesla with react we got facebook with react and javascript and then you can also do server apps like netflix and we actually built netflix which was a clone and we showed it to you guys in our youtube channel now job opportunities and salary guys so check it out for javascript and react in your first year as a developer with less than one year of experience as possible you could be doing 75 000 a year this is data these are stats this is according to pay scale um and then uh between one to four years you could be at 82 000 and beyond yeah here if you look on indeed you got over 45 000 jobs listed there right now and then if i go here to up work you see 8 000 jobs available there right now so you could also just go there and check it for yourself yep and for react js developer this is this the average salary no this is better than the average size this is a median salary yeah it's a median salary so usually you may come in around 68 to 100k i'd say like as a sort of junior but as a good junior developer i'd say and then guys it's never let anyone tell you that you can't reach that number right because like i'm it's just like it really pisses me off when i hear a very conservative developer who's like yeah you're gonna have to work for four years to get that you don't have to work for four years it's all about how you build yourself as a developer how you build your soft skills as a developer and there's more to it it's not just like woo random stuff like sunny was making over a hundred thousand you know a year as a react developer yeah honestly and that was combined between a salary and some freelance work and that pushed me over the 100k mark and guys it's possible it can be done and i can tell you my salary went from very it was way it was actually below that low mark my salary when i first started coding right and it went up to literally just kind of at the median mark pretty much and because this is the representative is in pounds so you literally got pushed up to the media mark in two years so let me ask you guys who here would like to make a hundred and twenty thousand a year would you like to make 120 000 a year doing react and building projects reply to me in the comments below and if you would like to make 120 000 a year then make sure you hit that like button [Laughter] all right smash that like button guys get this video out to as many people as you can all right so absolutely insanity we have a lot of people we've got 1200 people live on facebook and then i don't even know how many we have on i believe we have people watching on youtube over 3500 viewers on youtube so that's fantastic all right let's keep going and if you're on youtube and you want to participate in the challenge click the link in the description and join the facebook group because that's where this challenge is happening all right so now let's talk about web frameworks and which ones are the most popular according to the professional developers yeah so guys you can see react is at the top of that list and something that i want to point out yeah exactly jquery is dying fast literally bootstrap you drop support for it was just about to say yeah bootstrap literally just killed jason got rid of it it's too slow it's way too slow everything that we you could do in jquery now we can do it in pure javascript and do it a lot easier like all that manipulation stuff right now just built into javascript exactly dude it's so much faster and guys i always see comments about like what about angular what about this stuff look at the numbers and there is a big difference between the angular demand and the react demand and something i will tell you is that the angular demand is slightly on the diminishing end whereas react is flying like it's unbelievably on a high right now and it's something which you're gonna like to answer your questions like rian angular net.net have a look at this this will answer it for you nice yeah i would see like april saying i would love to make 120 000 a year patch says [ __ ] a yes brian says hell yeah bring on the 120k show me the money i love that and it's okay to like money because you can do so much with it right you can buy your time back you can buy your freedom back um and i was actually on a call with patch before he joined profit with javascript and also this challenge and he as actually he was a bartender and then because of kovid like ended up losing his job and he's a man of many talents so he's like a bartender and then he's also an actor and i'm sure he can do a ton of more things i can't even think about right now so do it is like crazy epic and now he's picking up coding he's like hey can i pick up coding and i'm like yeah dude i'm like i've seen everybody pick up coding but like i haven't seen an actor or a bartender pick up coding so i was like let's see if this is actually possible and then you start picking it up and then a few weeks later he's like i didn't know any coding and now he's like building apps and putting them up on the stories and tagging us and i'm like dude what the hell this is awesome he built a peaky blinder the peaky blinder was his favorite show on netflix so he built like this app and it's like all about peaky blinder nice dude that's awesome guys quick story as well my first one of my sort of first students after university was a 12 year old student he was a 12 year old student so i always see questions of am i too young or am i too old guys 12 years old and guess what after seven months of teaching him how to code from no experience with one session a week he landed his own school at 12 years old guys oh his own school as a client oh yeah right yeah that kid is awesome and i think that it just goes to show what's possible so nasir at 14 or abdullah 12 like it just goes to show that it's possible you know age doesn't really matter whether you're older or younger just put in the freaking work you know what i mean like don't use excuses to hold you back also react is one of the most loved programming languages um and you can see over here there's also type we got typescript right which is part of it so typescript is actually one of the things that's most loved and with react you can actually use typescript and then here if we looked at the most loved and wanted most frameworks um we got react at the top above everything and exactly one of the reasons is because it's actually secretly not even a framework it's actually a library it's very very lightweight yet it's also extremely powerful yeah and guys the main thing the thing is we showed you what the love frameworks are we showed you that sort of stuff but the most wanted framework is what is going to lead you to your sort of monetary goal right if it's wanted it's in demand and we can see here on indeed how many jobs have we got here quasi we got 51 781 jobs just on indeed if you type in react so the amount of jobs here are absolutely insane and you know what i would do i would literally make this amazon project that we're gonna show you tomorrow on day two three and four and i'll just start applying to some of these jobs just to see what they say maybe they're looking for an intern maybe i'll just tell them i'll work for free don't underestimate the power of working for free guys like it's absolutely insane most of the people that actually started working with us at cleverprogrammer initially started by working for free and brought value and then they're now working at clever programmer and killing it so with a lot of these jobs they are looking for people who are talented or looking to learn and they can train you exactly exactly and just to note that that's just in the united states 50 000 jobs exactly it's global international and it doesn't matter if you're outside the states you can land that job inside the state just like you can see here so in u.s it's about 6 000 a month is the average salary in canada it's about 4 000 a month in germany about 4 000 a month and united kingdom about 3 000 a month so yeah even if you're can't get a job in usa like there's so much of the world you can then get a job and you can get a job in germany online or united kingdom and now the most of the world is doing things online and remote so i think the opportunity now is more than ever because before they were looking to hire people in person now i don't know maybe this thing is going to be going on for a whole another year so i actually think there's more opportunity now than ever and you're part of the global space now you can really get a job anywhere exactly and guys it depends it doesn't really matter what country you're in you can access markets and this isn't possible in any other job market like you can access the us market you can access the uk market the canadian market even if you're in like in sri lanka in different countries malaysia it doesn't matter where you are you can access these markets um and so yeah you guys can definitely access these markets we are at 148 dollars in donation thank you guys so much we're sorry we're not giving it a shout out as much but again really really appreciate it that's massive yeah um and guys remember tomorrow we're going to be live at 11 a.m so this is just a friendly reminder if you need to add it to your phone just go ahead on your phone and open up your clock app and just set alarms for 11 a.m pacific so whatever that time is but literally just like spam it like this because i think that this is going to be one of the most important things and tomorrow we're just bringing the heat tomorrow we are building amazon no joke we're building amazon tomorrow guys full on amazon so you definitely want to show up for it because it's going to be the most valuable thing you can put on your portfolio and i we know students have already landed jobs with the things that they've built so you can very likely be that success story so make sure you put your alarms on for that and with that let's continue exactly so here we go now what can you do with react now guys here are the things you can do with react right you can actually build a netflix app like this which we actually built on clever programmer and shows you guys how to do it you can build facebook clone just like this with react and you know sunny had a live training and he showed you guys exactly how to do this you can build the airbnb app and this is also built with react and this was built from scratch and we showed you guys how to build this on our youtube channel yep and we taught all of these lives for free on youtube so definitely go check them out but today what we're going to be doing is something really really special and tomorrow we're going to be doing something really special because now we're not only going to build amazon but we're going to build the entire back end out and the ability to accept payments so now this is going to be from 0 to 100 a completed project you can put on your portfolio and literally land jobs with it so tomorrow son you want to talk about what they'll be doing exactly guys so we've broken it down into three days right and at the end of the three days what you're going to have is a fully functional amazon clone so it's going to have this ui it's this beautiful ui there's commit it's going to be responsive we're going to have basket functionality we are going to have order checkout processing we are going to have payment processing which is insane guys like you'll be able to run a card on you this on on this program and it will work right yeah we're also going to have sign in functionality the ability to create accounts log in all the data is going to be tracked in firebase firestore which is a realtime database and here's the app right now so we can actually demo it a little bit and if you guys can find um so yeah this is what the app right now and check it out you guys when i hit add to basket on any of these so when i add to basket for this one or the next one you're actually gonna see that cart all the way over there and it's gonna change to two so for example if i do add to basket and add to basket boom now it's at two if i go inside of this both of these items are now here in my basket my item total is 298. if i get rid of one of them remove from basket now we're at 199. if i get rid of both of them boom gone you will also have the ability to sign in and sign out so user authentication is going to be a part of it and just look at the experience of this app it literally looks like amazon but this is amazon clone and it's so damn fast everything i click on is just instant there's no wait time exactly guys and to cover some of the points in case you guys are interested we are going to be using stripe for the payment processing if you guys are interested in learning things like redux redux is going to be used in the form of the react context api so we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and create that with the react context api we've got react router for dynamic page viewing inside of react apps we have we're going to deploy the thing so we're going to show you how once you've built this entire app how simple it is to go ahead and deploy it with firebase hosting and all of this guys we are going to make it so simple to follow so simple to go ahead and copy everything that we do learn from what we do and then you guys will be able to add this to your portfolio which we're going to give you today yup and we're going to be giving you the portfolio that sunny just talked about so that's insane on top of all of this so yeah uh zachary says the rest of this month is all react js and clones for me damn can i do it i've never worked on react before absolutely you can't even if you're a complete beginner um somebody says ricardo says are we going to use stripe.js for payments i think there's a react stripe something right there's a react library for stripe yeah so we actually have two parts we have we're going to be teaching you how to do cloud functions to process the payment so firebase cloud functions to go ahead and process a payment and then we also have the front end which is how you basically capture the user's card details and that's something called stripe checkout so we're going to implement stripe checkout on the front end and that's going to allow you to do the whole user experience of collecting the card details and all that sweet stuff yeah with payment so much can go wrong but like yeah and it's going to be crazy building it live i don't think anybody in the developer world has built payment processors live dude tell me anyone right now who has done the entire tech stack is a full stack build it has firebase it has complete payment functionality there's nobody doing it right now and like we're gonna break it down to a point where beginners can do it yeah that that is nuts so guys definitely you want to show up tomorrow and if you're coming tomorrow make sure you say in the chat that i'm gonna be showing up tomorrow i'm committing to showing up tomorrow and then put the time at 11 a.m pacific okay los angeles time we want to see those comments starting to go right because we want to see you there and i want to shout out some of the people who are committing to showing up tomorrow yep all right so you're going to be learning how to set up firebase full user authentication learn how to use react router react contact cpi add to basket functionality checkout page login page setting up payment gateways and much more and done in a way where it's going to be for beginners so that's going to be epic liz frost says i'll be here tomorrow 1 p.m pacific yes let's let's go let's do that on liz is awesome and here is where the fun begins and again when you ask yourself where do i begin it doesn't matter just start are we ever gonna fix these slides where the gif image comes first and the title comes later yeah i mean it was a nice transition you know all right all right cool so let's learn some react.js guys and in react.js right we have a ton of different things so one of the main things we're going to be teaching you is what sunny react components yeah so we're going to teach you guys what are like we're going to teach you guys pretty much the fundamentals of react so what are react components react component react is essentially broken down into you just write small components that are reused so for example the products on amazon you write that code once and you just reuse it as many times as you need to so let me yeah let me just show that highlight that so it's not intimidating and it just sounds simple so for example when um we're gonna show you literally tomorrow how to make this product like so this one thing over here right this is gonna be a product component literally then it's almost as easy as writing one line and just copy paste the entire thing so then you don't need to keep writing your code for making a new product just write one line that says product and boom it creates this whole product here exactly and then we're going to show you guys even the components underneath there so you see they actually go ahead and behave responsively so you can see that's the same component it's just we're going to show you guys how to reuse the same component and also be responsive so it's going to be a huge massive uh knowledge bomb tomorrow so make sure you guys are here tomorrow and i can see loads of people in the comments dropping that in it's exciting stuff guys and yeah it's going to be a massive amount of value bomb that's epic yeah we're seeing people so let me see who's uh somebody's saying uh rodney says i will be there tomorrow 2 p.m eastern i'm locked in can't wait to edit the profile let's go daniel says i'll be in tomorrow at 11 a.m pst that will be hawaii time hey beautiful candace says i'm committed to showing up tomorrow i'm in all the way guys this is beautiful emmy says excited for tomorrow definitely showing up 11 california time that's 3 p.m for me dino says 4 a.m wake up well worth it hey 4 a.m wake up beautiful nice so you want to touch base more on this or should we move on uh so guys this is a quick shout out so pretty much if you want to sort of have some useful uh i post regularly on me and kazi both do it and here's just a little slide we shared in on our instagram it's just discussing what component based design visually so you pretty much have a web page broken down into components and we're going to run through all of this soon so if you guys don't know the stuff it's completely fine like we said we're going to break it down for beginners um yeah and this is covered in his so for example um for example right now i'm on sunny's page here you guys can see and if i go to react components here i can slide and like just kind of consume his content but then learn so it's tons of value so here he's showing you below below shows a website design based on components so you design your website in a componentbased way and then you can pick up so much code classbased components versus functionbased components so tons and tons of value bombs like if you guys haven't followed sunny go ahead and do that right now like literally go on instagram and just go to sss four s's just remember that or as yeah all right anger four s's and then anger right after that uh and follow him because he's dropping value bombs there every day exactly and these are a lot of questions we get all the time what are classbased components what functional components and guys we answer those things we're going to answer them today we're going to answer them tomorrow everything that you need just go ahead and follow us on socials and yeah we can go ahead and get started oh crap um i think is this the same person sumit messaged and he said qazi i landed a new job yesterday i already informed sunny yeah nice yep he's also making stories so look at that that's sick so guys when you make stories make sure you guys tag us because then what we do is we'll take your exact story right so now i'm on my story and i'm actually gonna post it so now i just posted his story to my story and he will get a shout out that way too so you guys should do that and take advantage of it exactly and that's going to help you guys grow as well because we tell you guys to record your journey as well so be a part of everything and yeah so tomorrow we're going to be going into hooks in a deeper way in a more technical way but as of now we just want to kind of give you guys the rundown of like a hook they're basically what they really are is they're simple functions they are easy to implement they are more lightweight than classes that's why we would react we won't be doing classes and again if you're a beginner and you don't know difference between classes and functional programming guess what that's a good thing because then we can just get you started on functional based programming and you won't waste your time having to unlearn all the bad habits that you developed exactly exactly it's going to be easy to test we're going to show you how to build custom hooks as well so react hooks are one of the most important things so the more you just get used to hearing and saying it literally the better you'll become yeah and consider yourself lucky guys like you came in right now at a time where there are things like hooks and hooks were a new addition in react 16.8 and guys it just makes life so easy so it's so fun to code and react now because of things like hooks and we're going to show you how to use everything in tomorrow's video absolutely all right and let's go ahead so class based versus functional base on the lefthand side right with the classbased component you see over here we have class hello world extends and then it goes react components and that's how you used to do it but now with functional based components it's more like just writing a regular function so you're not doing class in extension you're just doing a function hello world you write your component and then here you can see that you're just rendering it like hello world you know just like how you render your classbased component but why write a classbased one when you can write a functional one exactly and to be honest guys what we do in pwj we even show you because it's a very valuable skill to know the difference between the two and how to translate the code but the main thing is guys do what is simple and we show you what is simple and we're going to show you in tomorrow's build how to build things in the simplest most efficient way yep and britney over here she says um i like this comment she goes hooks are literally a life and time saver so i feel you i fill you with that i came at a time when i was coding react when it was just classes and then when hooks came out i was like god damn it these things are the best thing in the world because literally all you're doing now is coding a function with some kind of input and some kind of output it's simple whereas before you had all this render class based stuff and it was confusing so now it's so fun to code in and you guys are lucky and you're gonna learn all of that stuff who just said they teach so good that they make me cry for not knowing their channel in the past that's insane love that comment damn i love that um so two we're gonna also talk about fundamentals like state and props these are something important that you guys need to know so let's start with state now components have memory what's going on here yep so this is this was my idea because components have something called memory right so we just showed you previously that you can have different product components but the reason why we have a goldfish here is because each component has its own memory right now when you refresh the page the component forgets about its memory so the way i think about this is a component is a bit like a goldfish as soon as you refresh it forgets his memory that's the easiest way to think of it and like we said guys we break it down in the simplest way that's all you need to remember a component can have some memory it can keep retain if you've got a number input it will keep track of what the number is but if you refresh the page the memory goes so what do we do how do we make sure that when we refresh it stays there what do we do so that's where we introduce things like firebase that's where we introduce things like persistence we're going to be showing you guys how to go ahead and do that that's going to be something really important but the main thing to know about state and on the next side we explain this is it all it is in simple terms guys is how you write a variable in a react state is how you write a variable in react that's very important okay yeah yep so you actually say that right over here you're like hey essentially write a variable in react and it's managed within the component and each component has its own isolated state so expound on that yeah so if we have like five different products each different each product is going to have its own little shortterm memory okay so let's go to i'm gonna go open that up so go for it and explain right so let's imagine we had a counter on each of these different products right each one is gonna have its own memory so if for example if the first one had a little counter with like one on for example the second one had like two three and you was you was to increment those counters each one would keep track of its own number and then and they don't know anything about the other one they don't basically they're not even communicating with each other right they're just living in their own world they're completely isolated beautiful so they're just it's like you see what i mean by the memory and then if you was to refresh the numbers would all reset to and the initial value that we gave it and with react what's so freaking sick you guys is imagine imagine if i wanted to change this product's image okay now what would happen on a regular website when i do that when i change this image over here from this maybe red color to you know i don't know maybe um blue color i really like blue so if i wanted to change it to a blue what would happen the whole page would refresh and slow down yep and then it would load again and it would be like a poor user experience and now what would happen in react is none of these other products would refresh like 1 3 four and five would not refresh the only thing that would refresh is two and it would also not even refresh the entire page it would literally refresh just only that component that like little product this is why react is so epic have you guys ever experienced that where you drop a comment on instagram and nothing refreshes it just that comment that refreshes but like the whole page just stays the same so you have this great wonderful experience yeah all you get is that lovely little ping as the message pops in that's it super slick super fast i love it or on facebook when you like drop a comment and you get this like little haptic feedback on your phone like vibrates a little bit like so yeah beautiful exactly so that's what he's talking about where it um you know where if you write things and they have their own state it's it's kind of like a really awesome thing all right yep so should we go to the next slide yeah so the next thing we're talking about is is how like essentially we spoke about hooks so we're not going to dive too far into the exact implementation but in a nutshell we have something called the use state hook and what that does is in a single line of code we can just set up the variable in react so for example if we had a count like in the code example here we give it an initial value of zero and you can see the single line of code in a functional component just does everything for us it sets up the component it does it all the clever magic behind and react and it's just one line of code and we just repeat and rinse this sort of cycle and it's very simple once you get the hang of it guys yep very very simple stuff and this code here what it's doing is we're creating some button all right and basically every time i click that button the button will say one and when i click it two more times it'll say three then if i click it three more times it'll say six how is it keeping track it's keeping track through state management and this variable count that we created that's all okay exactly so a really easy way to cr uh keep track of things in react so this is a ustate hook all right um and what the heck are props honey right so this is another fundamental of react and it's very important to cover it today because props are essentially you saw earlier kazi showed you a bunch of different products right yeah now if we're reusing the same product surely how do we make how do they why do they not all look the same and that's because of props so all props stands for properties it just allows you to basically pass in data so let's go back to the amazon app for a second kazi and let's show them that for example we have all those different products on the page each one has a different picture it has a different title it has a different price a different star rating all of those things all we do is just pass it in as props and that's it it's as simple as that and it can render the component in a slightly different way got it okay yeah and that's it that's as simple as it can be and that's where we say guys don't over complicate it it'll be as simple as that um in other words like is one of the things we're passing like a prop is the title of this product right yep exactly got it so yeah so basically like i would imagine that if i create a component called product then what like to get this like red mixer here maybe what i need to do is i need to like write product and then in props just give it like the title um give it the image that it needs and maybe the price that it needs and once i give it that then what it will do on its end is actually um take that title and pop that in over here yep take that image pop that in over here yep right and then take that price and pop it in right there is that right exactly that that's exactly what's going to happen props are basically like arguments in a function right in regular programming it's kind of like that literally yeah think of it as an argument to a function which is why it goes so well so props are props are to components as arguments or to functions yeah think of it that way yeah exactly that probably awful way for most people to think of it but helps me somebody just said oh people are saying wow and sending heart emojis so it must be good they like it that's kind of cool you can see that on facebook nice all right somebody says you guys are making me fall in love with react hey don't forget about yourself don't forget about your mom i'm gonna tell your girlfriend falling in love with react all right let's go here so the next page we have just a small little code snippet showing exactly what cause he said so on the bottom you can see it renders out a hello world component yeah and we're passing the name prop with the value john right yep just like an argument so that's first exactly and the way we use it is we just say props dot name in the actual function so it's super simple guys it's very very simple stuff oh i like it let me actually do this here hey props no so yeah we got drop here and boom name john and then i'll pull that out and go hello john nice yeah so hold up where though is redux so a lot of us know about something called redux and we're always throwing the world around like oh my god should we use redox what the heck is redux and and it kind of gets a bit confusing right i remember when i landed my first job i had no idea even how to code with redux so my first year on your first job yeah this was me on my first job i just said to him i was like i really don't know how to do redux they're like can you code react i said yep they said well you learn it on the job so that's one thing i want to tell you guys don't freak out if it scares you too because i was also scared of redux so all it is guys is a data layer so a data layer so what we have is we showed you guys about props we showed you guys how you can pass props into different components but what tends to happen is sometimes you need for example a user right so let's say you log in as a user in a component and let's say that component is at the top of the tree right so let's say that login component is at the top of the tree and let's say you need it in a bunch of different components hold on i'll help you out here give me one second so let's go i'm gonna do something so let's go here so login component right there yeah so let's say that's the login component right now loads of different um props underneath right are going to basically maybe require that user that you logged in with right yeah which means that you kind of have to like pass the user down the tree right got it you have to con so imagine at the bottom if we had something like um a message okay message component so i'll just write m here for that so message component now the message probably needs the user right yep exactly so then what does it need to do it needs to go all the way back up there to get the user information from the login so that's what you would want it to do but in reality without a data layer you have to pass the login down that tree all the way through the component through another component through another component until you get to that message so will your code look like a lot of like you know like dot dist and dot something else and yeah you're gonna have to pass the user as a prop down to the next component and then down to the next one and we call that problem prop drilling yeah right and as soon as you see prop drilling you just like stop coding and you say okay i need to implement something like a data layer which is basically going to wrap it and do what kazi just sort of explained earlier which is you just want to be able to pull it straight from the login exactly so basically what a data layer allows us to do is just have it in one place where everybody can access it right like where you can access it directly so instead of having this like crappy structured structure you just have one data layer and that has all the information that you need so then for example when the user needs the login information instead of having to go this prop drilling route you just go and grab the user's information from right there exactly think of it as a global variable right it's a global store like it just sits on top it wraps the entire app and what you can do is when you log in you can push the user in so you can just throw the user inside that global store and then if you need it in the messages you can just go ahead and grab it but you don't have to do any of this properly i got i got an idea of how we can explain it in a simple way um so for example right um when i hit add to basket is this being added to data layer that i added this product it is being added to the data yes okay so what we're gonna do is as soon as i clicked add to basket right this is what i want you to imagine that happened um holy crap this is heavy on my computer so as soon as i hit add to basket this is the data layer and it just got added in there okay yep exactly um so now this is i'm just going to call it tls that just means the lean startup so we're just gonna do tls here okay and yeah i got the pricing and everything of it and it's in the data layer and have access to it okay yeah now let's just add one more thing as well maybe i'll add in that um the kenwood mix stand the red the red thing right yep um and for that i'll just call it k um kms kenwood mixtape okay okay so so now what happens when i click on if i hit add to basket now those two are added so when i go to basket those are in the data layer and that's how it knows about them but if i remove from basket it'll actually kick it out of the data layer right exactly boom yeah when i hit remove from basket now the kms is gone it's out of the data layer now i want you guys to pay attention to what cars you just said because we have that data layer now and what we can do is you see in the header right now we have the basket icon right we can use this data layout these objects in the data for so many different purposes right so we can actually go ahead and have it inside that's why it says one next to the basket because it uses the information from the data to calculate what's in the basket we also have it's kind of over what we've drawn but it also shows you the total and that is also pulled from the data there so these these different components aren't getting prop drilled all this stuff is just kind of grabbing things from the data they're saying all right let me add this up yeah so it's a very very nice way of coding it's very nice yep and it makes everything really fast and that way you just move fast without any kind of like nightmare issues with prop drilling exactly okay so if that doesn't make full sense don't worry because it probably took sonny like two years after he was doing it to kind of make sense yeah and you know what guys i'll tell you a story like i literally landed my first job i wasn't sure about how to code and react and i literally was on the train just watching youtube videos right and it was it yeah exactly don't be afraid the reality of this is gonna be you're not gonna understand any of this stuff but you're gonna be doing it exactly uh and that's oh that's what you want like you'll we'll show it to you and then through pattern recognition you'll be able to execute it even though if you don't completely know underlying what's happening then it'll make sense at some point all right exactly so introducing the react context api what it does is it just makes redux which is a very powerful technology that all react developers or developers in general should know about but it makes that really easy and it's the way that we recommend that you guys actually learn um like this is should be your first baby step before you get into redux and it's still extremely powerful the both patterns are the same it's just the react context the api is a super easy way to learn the pattern then you can move on to redux in a very easy way exactly so let's move forward and remember it's like context api acts as a global store okay this is something we touched and now your apps are now basically put into beast mode and what is this so this is exactly kind of like once we had that once we achieved once we are able to use things like the react context api we can actually go ahead and build the powerful apps like we showed you earlier so the netflix clone the facebook clone the airbnb clone the amazon clone all of those things are possible because we can use the react context api and have that data layer and have that extra layer of functionality to our app absolutely and then you can build things like facebook clone or airbnb clone or the amazon clone we're going to actually show you how to build tomorrow with full backend functionality and tomorrow we're going to be covering firebase as well so what is firebase and why is it so useful for a react developer and we're going to touch base on in a little bit because it also allows you to host your app online all right and firebase is honestly the easiest way to go and it allows you to scale to 100 million users if 100 million users got onto your app because it's google so google knows how to scale to it makes your life a lot easier cloud firestore and write this down guys because if this is a lot that's okay we're here to just over deliver on the value make sure you take notes on it so then it's there for you but cloud firestore is essentially a and by the way are you guys with us still i just want to make sure you guys are still with us so drop it in the comments below because i want to make sure all of your guys energy levels are always high because we're watching your chat and looking at your comments so hardeep chanil yamna talha shantanu we want you guys to be energized and pumped up in peak state because as time starts to go your energy levels will start to go down so make sure that's what i'm talking about dude look as soon as you said that look at the response everyone yeah there we go so we want that energy level to start rising up guys and we want you back jonathan says i'm with you pablo says here we are yum that says let's go epic guys keep that energy high because then you are gonna remember all of this information all right so it's gonna actually help you out tremendously all right so cloud firestore real time database what does this mean you will have a database that allows you to store stuff so then when you refresh things don't vanish simple as that the same reason why you go to instagram not all of your posts are deleted you go the next day they're there and firebase and cloud firestore is the easiest way to actually host your app uh moving forward it allows you user authentication so with your app guys how sick is it gonna be wouldn't it be sick guys for you if you had google authentication on your app or you had facebook authentication or twitter or github it would make you look so badass and professional right because people come on to your app and they're like hey i can sign in with google that's dope charlene says you guys are great thanks for the knowledge they are energized and pumped up i'm loving it guys now cloudbased functions sunny touch on this so this is what you need essentially a lot of people ask like oh do i need to know node.js or express and things like that so with cloud functions it provides a scalable really easy way to still be able to use node.js and have like those backend functions that we need but they're in a serverless architecture which is so dope super scalable and we're going to be using cloud functions to go ahead and incorporate and develop that payment processing that we spoke about earlier so we're going to have stripe functionality which is going to be powered by cloud functions exactly they're very very it allows you to learn server less architectures too instead of monolithic apps this is the way forward for developers this is actually the best way in my opinion to do things moving forward so you learn serverless functionality miriam says of course i would never miss the golden information and she goes i even skipped dinner for this so no regrets good nice that's kind of the level you want to be at firebase also allows you to have full storage of your media and things like that and it'll optimize images and all sorts of media or videos that you throw on it um and it allows you to grow your business or do a b testing and notifications and all that good stuff the best part about firebase is what sunny it's completely free guys it's fast free easy to use we say free it's free up to a very generous limit which you guys aren't going to need to use at this point so guys completely free completely free completely free so let's go forward so what's happening tomorrow tomorrow what are you guys doing drop it in the comments below i want to see if you are paying attention or not you are going to be building what you're building the amazon clone with full front end full backend functionality you're gonna be able to accept card payments that's gonna be nice you're gonna be able to host it online and put it on your portfolio that's gonna be nice and you're gonna use this to get a job and that's gonna be real nice so hey let's move forward and you have homework that is due tomorrow so now we've gone to the most important part and this is the part where if you are on youtube make sure you join the facebook group because that's where you will put your homework and we will give you personal feedback and we

this is due tomorrow guys so like i want you guys to go ahead do this homework and then submit this in the link that we're going to give you right now and basically yeah exactly and we're going to yeah i'm actually going to bring the portfolio should i share the github link with them as well yeah let me show it again all right sure so here is boom like all right here we go so here is the portfolio here's where you guys can go on github and make sure you put a star and fork it then that way it will be saved and you guys will have access to it this is going to be the react portfolio with the full code behind it all right and um there's a video that for is there for you to watch okay um and you can click this image as well and it'll explain to you and here's a live demo this look so this live demo we have it hosted for you on netlify and you guys can actually go here and use it so here we go i'm sonny sanga i'm a londonbased react.js developer and instructor clever programmer and freelancer by night papa react dude this is clean this is clean yeah look at how modern and amazing this is right at the top we got that clean nav bar maybe i'll should i zoom in a little bit so maybe it's easier for people to see this yeah yeah you can zoom in all right so we got the resume testimonials and all this and i imagine this is flat like one page right perfect perfect this is flat yeah nice okay so you've got your education your work your skills and you can and it's very simple to customize this and you've also got some portfolio sections so guys what i want you to do is if any of you guys have made apps projects before go ahead include those in that section you've got a nice little testimonial section and guys notice as quasi scrolls down the top's actually getting dynamically updated so the navbar actually changes depending on what section you're in and then we have a contact form which actually works so if you fill out this contact form it will actually go ahead and send an email to the appropriate sort of person they'll open up your mail client and it will go ahead and pop up on your screen damn um i know which is awesome dude so this is fantastic guys would you like to have this freaking portfolio with a click of a button let me know in the comments because i would have killed i would have maybe not killed but done something very very bad to get a portfolio like this when i was becoming a developer um and this is proven and tested and this these are portfolios have gotten people jobs so we're just giving you the thing to be able to download all right so let's go back to what your homework is now all right here we go pop that bad boy open so your homework do for tomorrow is the following you're gonna download the portfolio you're gonna watch how to use the portfolio is the portfolio linked in the facebook script okay we'll link it great uh so watch how to use the portfolio uh run it you're gonna run it locally with npm start so this is something that you know we've shown you guys or you guys just download react you know you can watch one of our videos and that can help as well is there a video sunny that maybe explains how to do this yep so there's a video which goes through all of this where is it uh made by david and rishi that's actually i can go ahead and drop you a link let's go ahead and we've got a lovely little loom video which explains all of this stuff it's actually gonna be okay so in the face but in the facebook group guys we're going to be creating a unit and all of the instructions are neatly going to be inside of the facebook group right so inside the facebook group and we'll also drop it in the slack community but make sure you guys interact inside the facebook group all right so make sure you guys go ahead and and interact inside the facebook group otherwise it's not counted unless you it's inside the facebook group so make sure you guys submit and interact inside that group yeah please guys because we want you all to participate we want to engage with you and we also want you to get a chance to win prizes with us like the 6000 r coding boot camp so for that you have to participate in the facebook group for the react challenge now remember you're going to need to update your details so it shouldn't say i'm sonny sango when i look at it it should say your name we're going to be actually judging this pretty critically and then going tomorrow we're actually going to be going over some of your portfolios and showing it off in front of everybody so make sure that it looks good so when other people see it it's representative of you and your work exactly update your experience on it update your description on it screenshot your portfolio once you have updated it and then what we want you to do is upload it as a comment people are saying yes maroot is like the kind of value you guys are delivering is insane miriam says i would love to and now i'm super excited to customize it oh that's sick that's actually really exciting yeah allow says this is an amazing portfolio from sunny so make sure you drop it in the comments and upload it to the facebook post we're gonna make a facebook post and you're gonna drop your homework as a image and then make sure you customize it so if you innovate on this portfolio the better you make it or maybe the more you innovate that's how you can get extra points so one it has to be good and something that you can show your potential employer two because if you innovate we're gonna give you extra points on it yep and then we've actually created a form for you guys you guys to go ahead so there's two things you guys are gonna need to do you just need to fill out that form and then you basically put in the link to your portfolio you put in the uh we've shown you in the video how you can actually deploy it as well yep and then we want that cause he said upload the actual screenshot as a comment in the facebook post uh post so that's really important guys yeah but do both because the facebook one allows us to engage with you and other people to see your work and engage with you as well i mean you also never know there's some people who could be employers looking through these comments and sometimes they might reach out to you and potentially give you opportunity to work with them it's that crazy exactly because there are some people who are giving jobs in this group because they see everybody wants to become a developer exactly um and we are going to be opening the doors to profit with javascript in a few days and we're going to be releasing it at the best price possible because in a week or two weeks it's going to go up in price because so many students have told us that this program is worth more than their 10 000 or even their 15 000 online coding boot camp so once the price goes up for this and we close the doors then one the price is never going to come back down and two we're not going to be opening the doors to this program for many months later so make sure that when we open the doors to this in about a week you show up and what i say to make it even easier is for september 13th mark it on your calendars because that's exactly when we're going to be opening up the doors to this program september 13th all right and that's gonna be i think around 11 a.m pacific as well so make sure you show up to that and it's going to be really really um it's going to be really big all right so let's move forward now more for your homework download visual studio code this is a must do task so make sure you go to this link click it and install this on your computer if you don't have it already this is what's going to allow you to write code download the extensions and follow us along exactly and then what what else you're going to need node.js in order to run the react app guys so in order to do npm start or to do anything like that you actually need node.js so you have to go over here all you have to do here guys is go ahead and download it for windows if you're on windows or download it from mac if you're on mac and install it and that is pretty much it and it will pretty much work after that and we've got a final slide where we pretty much are going to hit we go ahead and tell you guys a really handy extension that we just add in there's a little bit of a closing point it's called es7 react snippets this will help you speed up your coding speed when you're coding with react in tomorrow's session so this will help you a lot in tomorrow's session be it fast if you're coding along with us um and yeah i think that's a really really cool extension which everyone should go ahead and download somebody says the portfolio just turned the heat up in here would let love to get a hold of it and customize it already beautiful stay engaged guys pay attention to this group the entire day put this facebook group in your favorites and set it as a shortcut and also turn on the notifications for everything and announcements in this facebook group because there might be something that we dropped that you might not know about or might not find out about
