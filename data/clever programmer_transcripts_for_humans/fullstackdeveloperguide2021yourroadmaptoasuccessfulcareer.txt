06:35 - what you see on the website and that
06:36 - includes what that includes html
06:39 - that includes css and that includes the
06:41 - javascript and those three are the most
06:44 - important things that you guys need to
06:45 - learn
06:46 - as the base foundation for a front-end
06:49 - developer
06:51 - beautiful okay i tried to give you some
06:54 - nice words that went along with it
06:56 - and now here are the job opportunities
06:58 - and salaries for developers so we
06:59 - already
07:00 - checked them out and i just want to show
07:01 - you guys some more so keep in mind guys
07:04 - i know a lot of you
07:04 - are have less than one year of
07:06 - experience in coding
07:08 - so that's why we want to show you
07:09 - opportunities where even with less than

07:30 - available to you guys so that's gonna be
07:33 - really really huge all right let's keep
07:37 - it moving forward
07:39 - okay so what am i looking at here with
07:42 - the stack overflow
07:44 - so guys check this out so stackoverflow
07:45 - does surveys every single year
07:47 - at hundreds of thousands of developers
07:49 - and javascript
07:51 - html css you know are literally always
07:54 - for the past few years have been at the
07:56 - top of the list right
07:57 - so that tells you it's just the
07:59 - popularity and the growth the most
08:01 - likely you're gonna have
08:03 - as you know as as the years go by and
08:05 - you know
08:06 - in the next five ten years right so i
08:09 - think that's just a lot
08:10 - super popular and it's important now
08:13 - what i touched on earlier for you guys
08:15 - it doesn't matter what countries you're
08:16 - in you can still
08:17 - be part of these job markets you could
08:20 - be part of usa
08:22 - part of canada germany united kingdom so
08:24 - your
08:25 - country doesn't really matter whether
08:27 - you are currently
08:28 - in you uh your uruguay or
08:32 - kenya or you are in dubai like it
08:35 - doesn't
08:36 - you know or saudi arabia or wherever

09:22 - smash that like button
09:24 - and just with that we can send this
09:25 - video out to so many other people who
09:28 - are trying to become developers
09:30 - get promotions land their dream jobs
09:34 - or become freelancers and start their
09:36 - own companies and we can all do that and
09:38 - be a part of it
09:40 - just by hitting that like button so this
09:41 - video goes out to them
09:44 - now moving forward this is overall
09:48 - just so guys front when we say
09:51 - full stack it's front end combined with
09:53 - backhand so let's dive into front end
09:55 - first
09:56 - now when you look at front end nowadays
09:58 - it it has gone like a little bit more
10:00 - complex than it used to be
10:02 - there's a lot of things you guys have to
10:04 - kind of know about
10:05 - for example of course you have to know
10:06 - about html css
10:08 - and javascript but within css
10:12 - these are some of the things you might
10:13 - have to start knowing about within
10:15 - javascript you might have to start
10:17 - knowing about frameworks like angular
10:18 - vue
10:19 - js or react i mean we will talk a lot
10:21 - about react
10:23 - a lot of our channel is pretty heavy on
10:25 - react as you guys will see
10:27 - in libraries well do you want bootstrap
10:29 - material ui
10:30 - or semantic and then in tools are you
10:33 - looking at npm webpack
10:34 - and chrome dev tools those are all and
10:36 - that's just
10:37 - that's not even all of it you know and
10:40 - in this video we'll go deeper into it
10:42 - but this is just to kind of show you
10:43 - guys the overall road map we're going to
10:44 - be looking at when we're talking about
10:46 - front end
10:52 - go ahead nas all right so guys good
10:54 - question
10:55 - what can you do with javascript first
10:57 - things is you can
10:58 - build web applications right so web
11:00 - applications include things like guys
11:02 - facebook that's a web app right
11:04 - we can build native apps i don't know if
11:05 - you know tesla
11:07 - the actual app for your ios and android
11:09 - is built
11:10 - with react which is insane right and you
11:13 - can also build
11:14 - server apps so server apps are your
11:16 - backend applications using node.js
11:19 - and those are very popular as well right
11:22 - exactly
11:23 - they're super powerful and now let's get
11:25 - into the technical
11:27 - nitty gritty so when it comes to html
11:30 - just learn the basics make a page make
11:32 - it work don't over complicate it so keep
11:34 - it simple and just get started
11:36 - now moving forward when we're talking
11:38 - about css
11:39 - vishal thank you for the first donation
11:41 - really appreciate that buddy
11:44 - learn how to use different layouts
11:45 - flexbox responsive design media queries
11:49 - and this is going to be part of css as
11:51 - you guys like
11:52 - learn it and then in javascript nas
11:55 - what's happening what we got we got
11:57 - obviously we got data types right so
11:59 - like your var
11:59 - your lat your cons right you've got your
12:02 - functions and the es6 is a very big part
12:04 - of it right so
12:05 - you have to know all the new es6
12:06 - standards you got dom manipulation
12:09 - you got scope you got your fetch api you
12:12 - also got your async of weight
12:14 - yeah so much along with that but very
12:16 - important as well
12:17 - yeah and we're talking about es6 and
12:19 - those things we are also talking about
12:21 - things like for example you guys have
12:23 - probably seen these arrow functions
12:25 - you know that's just like a little
12:27 - example of
12:29 - what we're talking about okay cool so
12:32 - let's move forward
12:33 - now we're not going to cover too much
12:35 - visual and design
12:36 - stuff because in our if you guys want to
12:38 - go deep into our front end developer
12:40 - guide we did produce one
12:42 - last week i believe you guys can go on
12:44 - our channel and check out our front end
12:46 - developer guide and we just go really
12:48 - deep into a lot of front end stuff
12:50 - and this one we're gonna get to more of
12:52 - the back end stuff so then we can give
12:54 - you guys
12:54 - that as well so definitely check that
12:57 - one out
12:58 - now when we're looking at what is a
13:00 - framework
13:01 - [Laughter]
13:03 - you know what is going on here and oh by
13:06 - the way
13:06 - bojack joined um profit with javascript
13:09 - yesterday and he actually just said in
13:11 - the co
13:12 - in the chat he goes really loving profit
13:14 - with javascript so
13:15 - far thank you bro that's awesome i
13:18 - appreciate it
13:20 - that is amazing i was super pumped when
13:22 - i saw him join yesterday i was so happy
13:24 - wow so awesome now
13:28 - let's keep going so we remember we touch
13:30 - base on some of the front end stuff
13:32 - and we will touch on frameworks now so
13:34 - now the most popular frameworks are
13:36 - which ones nas
13:38 - we got angular obviously right then we
13:40 - also got
13:41 - vue and then we got our favorite one
13:44 - quasi
13:45 - react hey
13:49 - yeah and i think you know what one as
13:51 - you can see from here right a lot of
13:53 - companies are using
13:54 - the all three frameworks are both very
13:56 - popular you got for example
13:58 - angularjs used by companies like the
14:00 - guardian upwork paypal sunny
14:02 - react gs airbnb instagram by ubereats
14:05 - and then ujs
14:06 - alibaba grammarly giblet and guys and
14:09 - so much more that's just the starting of
14:12 - it right
14:13 - um so yeah all very important all
14:16 - very uh popular uh frameworks
14:19 - yep and i wrote which one is our
14:22 - favorite i wrote it underneath
14:24 - which should you choose so when it comes
14:27 - to framework there's a big war between
14:29 - the most
14:30 - loved frameworks the most dreaded and
14:32 - the most wanted
14:34 - under the most wanted you will see my
14:36 - beautiful friend react.js
14:38 - it is by far the most wanted
14:42 - and then underneath it you will see
14:43 - other ones like vue or angular
14:45 - django and all of that now all these
14:48 - frameworks guys are super
14:50 - powerful they're really really powerful
14:52 - but react right now is
14:54 - on this type of trend like you know
14:57 - those exponential curves that they
14:58 - taught us in school
15:00 - angular is a little bit on the downward
15:02 - trend and the view
15:04 - is doing okay the reason for that you
15:07 - guys
15:07 - is angular is a lot more opinionated
15:12 - and it's a framework view is a framework
15:15 - react is actually just a library
15:18 - so it's pretty much like you're just
15:20 - using javascript so it's extremely
15:22 - lightweight
15:23 - and then it's super powerful which is
15:25 - why companies like instagram and
15:26 - facebook are using it
15:30 - so this is the trend that i was
15:31 - referring to you guys can see here is
15:33 - react
15:34 - and then here is the react curve and
15:36 - this is modern according to google
15:38 - trends
15:39 - and these are actually the downloads per
15:41 - year
15:42 - and then you guys can see where
15:44 - downloads from where i think i don't
15:46 - know actually
15:48 - not exactly sure but here's angular i
15:51 - think
15:51 - sorry the thing is just download the
15:52 - general just downloading the actual
15:54 - library itself
15:55 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what
15:57 - yeah um
15:58 - so there you go so when you think react
16:02 - you know react for the win so that's
16:04 - what we're going with
16:05 - and it has a really nice component-based
16:08 - design
16:09 - to it so nas go for it
16:12 - yeah so one of the big things guys in
16:14 - react is all about managing data
16:17 - that's you know that's what kind of sets
16:19 - react apart from a lot of these like
16:21 - framework frameworks and it's something
16:23 - called redux
16:24 - and it's a little bit hard to understand
16:26 - but we're going to go to there so let's
16:27 - go ahead to the next thing
16:29 - so redux context api that is when you
16:32 - were able to for example
16:34 - properly you know store data think of it
16:36 - as like
16:37 - you know data a local data of your
16:40 - on your application and then kind of use
16:42 - it throughout your whole app
16:44 - so whenever you change one thing for
16:46 - example on the one side of the app
16:48 - right another thing will be able to
16:50 - change as well so it kind of
16:51 - talks in sync with each other exactly
16:55 - and managing data in react you guys can
16:57 - look into mobx as well
16:59 - which is kind of like next level of
17:01 - things but it's
17:02 - bleeding edge but you know it's just
17:04 - something optional for you to look into
17:06 - and as bruce buffer apparently says
17:11 - we have tons of live bills that we've
17:13 - put on youtube
17:14 - and you guys can check them out so
17:18 - we actually did a zoom clone build
17:21 - we did spotify clone build with react
17:24 - we built tick tock with react
17:28 - we built youtube clone with react we
17:30 - built tinder with
17:32 - react and we build
17:35 - a bunch of other things like netflix
17:37 - would react right over here
17:38 - and we built instagram with react and a
17:41 - real time
17:42 - chat app for facebook messenger and just
17:45 - yesterday
17:46 - we built slack real-time chat app
17:49 - with react so guys if you are looking to
17:53 - learn and react
17:54 - you are in the right place or if you're
17:56 - looking to learn just javascript in
17:58 - general
17:59 - you're in the right place yeah and i
18:01 - think and if you guys have any
18:02 - suggestions for us on what you want to
18:04 - see in terms of next like a next
18:07 - clone in react literally drop that in
18:09 - the comments below
18:12 - yep
18:17 - take it away nas all right so back in
18:20 - development
18:20 - so let's get so guys front end
18:22 - development was the first thing that we
18:24 - cover right that is the first
18:25 - part of full stack developer now the
18:28 - backend right
18:29 - that is the backend part of the
18:31 - application so that is the server side
18:33 - part of the application and so and this
18:35 - is like the salary of the back-end
18:36 - developer
18:37 - individually you can see 127
18:41 - k average salary which is pretty much
18:44 - comparable with the front developer just
18:46 - maybe a little bit higher now
18:47 - yeah exactly even a little bit higher
18:50 - sometimes yeah yeah
18:51 - so huge keep going all right
18:55 - so with back-end development guys what
18:57 - language do we use
18:59 - right that's a good question so there's
19:00 - a lot we have python we have javascript
19:03 - we have
19:04 - go typescript rust java and so
19:07 - much more but i think we'll kind of
19:09 - differentiates back end is like
19:11 - now is what frameworks are we going to
19:13 - use right
19:14 - as you can see python's top one
19:16 - javascript's second so let's see
19:18 - which ones we can actually what
19:19 - frameworks go along with those languages
19:22 - so node.js one of the one of the
19:25 - most popular ones interestingly enough
19:27 - guys
19:28 - netflix yes netflix actually uses
19:32 - node.js
19:33 - for their whole backend structure the
19:36 - whole backend development structure so
19:38 - node.js
19:38 - next thing we have what let's go keep
19:40 - going
19:42 - let's keep going and so javascript as
19:45 - you can see right
19:45 - javascript is node.js and javascript
19:48 - allows us to do front-end
19:50 - and back at the same time right that was
19:53 - react
19:53 - right for front end and then back in is
19:55 - with node.js so very popular with that
19:58 - yeah so javascript can the great thing
20:01 - about learning javascript
20:02 - is it's kind of a hack like it's a
20:04 - little trick
20:05 - you're essentially learning front end
20:07 - and back end at the same time so if you
20:08 - get a javascript you're kind of getting
20:10 - good at both
20:11 - simultaneously and that makes you a full
20:13 - stack developer basically
20:14 - yep yeah and yeah keep going
20:17 - yeah next thing we got we got another
20:20 - big big popular language
20:21 - and then we got a bust programming
20:23 - language then that was next one go link
20:25 - java right and then yeah golden java and
20:29 - now at this point
20:30 - we've covered the let's now talk about
20:33 - how we
20:34 - store data that's a full stack developer
20:38 - yep so now guys here we got sql
20:42 - that allows you to store data and then
20:45 - we also have
20:46 - no sql on the other side so when we're
20:49 - talking about storing data
20:51 - in very basic terms think about it like
20:54 - a video game where you have
20:55 - saves and you can have checkpoints if
20:58 - you couldn't store data
20:59 - you couldn't have all the likes showing
21:02 - up under your instagram post
21:05 - if you couldn't store data you couldn't
21:06 - come back the next day and your
21:08 - instagram post would be gone
21:10 - yep so essentially that's storing data
21:13 - for some reason it took me the longest
21:15 - time to understand
21:16 - what a database was because it always
21:18 - just sounded complicated
21:19 - super complicated but it's really just a
21:22 - savings
21:23 - checkpoint in a video game okay and if
21:25 - you couldn't store data you won't be
21:26 - able to see this youtube video
21:28 - oh yeah yeah exactly that's a big point
21:32 - and so if you have so nosql database
21:35 - right what's cool about those
21:36 - is they are highly scalable they have
21:39 - high availability
21:40 - really fast performance replication and
21:43 - then big data capability
21:51 - so let's go up to here nosql and then we
21:54 - also got c so this is
21:56 - when we say nosql and sql these are the
21:58 - two that we got right here
22:00 - all right these are the two things so
22:02 - it's always a thing that people are
22:04 - debating between which way they want to
22:06 - go
22:07 - sunny and i often times kind of just go
22:09 - with
22:11 - firebase which is essentially no c it's
22:13 - a nosql and a sql hybrid which we'll
22:15 - talk about later
22:17 - but you know sql you got your relational
22:19 - tables
22:20 - in sql also you have to have all the
22:23 - tables and columns kind of predefined
22:26 - whereas in nosql you have a lot more
22:28 - flexibility you can map things out on
22:29 - the fly
22:30 - so if you're building things for your
22:33 - own self honestly i think it's a lot
22:34 - more fun to use nosql just because
22:36 - you're not really bounded by a lot of
22:38 - things and you can
22:39 - kind of play around with data and all of
22:41 - that
22:42 - and um and then yeah if you can switch
22:44 - it to a sequel at some point if you
22:46 - want yeah but i want to make a small
22:49 - addition guys
22:50 - both are important and both are
22:51 - important to learn a lot of companies
22:53 - are using nosql a lot of companies are
22:55 - also using sql
22:57 - so yeah definitely consider that too
22:59 - right
23:00 - like nosql you know no they're examples
23:03 - of nosql
23:04 - are like mongodb right mongodb and then
23:08 - you have
23:08 - firebase things like that and then sql
23:11 - you have
23:12 - my sequel you got postgresql
23:15 - yep yep those are two two top ones yeah
23:18 - so they're like really big
23:21 - all right and then you guys got graphql
23:23 - which is you know
23:24 - you start getting into the api type of
23:26 - world but i think graphql is important
23:28 - to learn
23:29 - there's mongodb firebase
23:32 - now uh nas you can talk about this
23:35 - so what is firebase and why is it so
23:37 - useful for full stack so we touched on
23:39 - guys that firebase is what it's a nosql
23:42 - database right but the reason why it's
23:44 - such a big
23:45 - part is because it is actually something
23:47 - called so actually go go to the right go
23:49 - to the right
23:50 - keep going keep going one more time
23:54 - it is a real time database that means
23:58 - that as you
23:59 - update things you will be you can
24:00 - basically create real-time applications
24:03 - like you know messenger right clone or
24:05 - whatsapp clone
24:06 - really easily without having to do like
24:09 - crazy
24:10 - you know coding or anything like that
24:12 - and that's what separates
24:13 - firebase from a lot of these other
24:16 - databases
24:17 - exactly and i already know a bunch of
24:20 - people
24:20 - are messaging like hey why don't we use
24:23 - aws
24:24 - and probably a lot of you are thinking
24:26 - if you have a choice guys between
24:28 - aws on one side and firebase on the
24:31 - other
24:32 - choose firebase the reason is
24:36 - firebase is just a easier aws
24:40 - yeah that's how i put it okay it's easy
24:43 - simple aws
24:47 - it has pretty much all the functionality
24:48 - you'll ever need okay look firebase is
24:50 - being used by companies like instacart
24:53 - and twitch so it's not that it's
24:57 - for little people or just if you're
24:59 - making a small app you could build
25:01 - very powerful things with firebase but
25:04 - we like to go with it just because it's
25:06 - so much simpler and easier i've done
25:07 - both aws and firebase and i choose
25:09 - firebase all the time just because with
25:11 - aws there's a lot of
25:13 - admin headache you have to deal with
25:15 - there's a lot of dev
25:16 - op stuff that you have to learn about
25:17 - which you know as a developer you kind
25:19 - of just want to develop and move forward
25:22 - and we're going to talk about a lot of
25:23 - other things with firebase as well in
25:24 - just a second so for example it is
25:26 - scalable
25:27 - so if you want to have 100 million users
25:29 - or whatever your app will
25:31 - scale to match that yeah
25:34 - and um this is what is the real data
25:36 - real-time database that firebase has
25:39 - and then if you want to even add things
25:40 - like machine learning
25:42 - or whatever you can actually just add
25:44 - that with firebase
25:45 - i'm sure just like aws has those types
25:48 - of functionalities
25:49 - and the really powerful thing about
25:51 - firebase you guys
25:52 - is you can build full backends without
25:55 - even doing anything
25:56 - with node without even doing anything
25:58 - like that you can actually just do
26:00 - cloud functions and cloud yeah cloud
26:04 - functions allow did you know this by the
26:05 - way now
26:06 - i didn't even know this honestly oh
26:08 - really so
26:10 - yeah you could actually do full on
26:12 - everything like if you want to build a
26:14 - payment gateway with stripe
26:16 - sunny and i actually built it with uh
26:18 - firebase
26:19 - with outfit that's insane okay okay yeah
26:22 - so you guys can do
26:24 - everything with just react and firebase
26:26 - and literally have a scalable app to 100
26:28 - million people
26:29 - and you know just handle everything like
26:31 - that firebase can also do storage for
26:34 - you so if your app has
26:35 - images firebase can optimize those
26:38 - images or media files
26:39 - for you and handle everything so this is
26:42 - why
26:43 - you know i really am a big advocate for
26:46 - it
26:47 - it's just like how aws has lambda
26:50 - firebase has cloud functions which is
26:52 - essentially the same functionality but
26:54 - just much easier to
26:55 - and you um user friendly
26:59 - nozzle you want to touch on this yeah no
27:02 - as a firebase is application it's like a
27:06 - really
27:06 - simply set up you know app to be able to
27:09 - authenticate or like log in you know
27:11 - you can log in i'm sorry i have to cut
27:15 - you off for a second your audio is
27:16 - cutting off
27:17 - maybe you can turn off your video and
27:19 - your audio would be better
27:21 - because your connection i think is
27:24 - dropping a little bit
27:25 - but i will i will speak to this point a
27:27 - little bit guys so
27:29 - authentication you can do all types of
27:31 - authentication like google
27:32 - facebook twitter github email or even
27:36 - phone all of these types of
27:38 - authentication you could do with
27:40 - firebase you guys and it's so
27:42 - easy it's all like few lines of code
27:45 - and one click of a button and boom you
27:47 - have google authentication built in
27:50 - as a matter of fact yesterday we built a
27:52 - clone
27:54 - for yo what did we build a clone on
27:56 - frankie yesterday what did we build
28:00 - look it up
28:03 - um slack so yesterday we built slack
28:06 - clone so real-time chat app using
28:09 - firebase
28:10 - and that clone that we built even had
28:14 - user authentication with a
28:17 - using firebase uh with google it had
28:19 - google user authentication
28:21 - so you guys can definitely use firebase
28:24 - for
28:24 - all of these types of things as well
28:27 - yeah thank you guys for reminding me
28:28 - everybody's yelling at me they're like
28:29 - slack hendricks is slack
28:31 - current is slack so thank you guys so
28:33 - much appreciate that
28:35 - all right so nas can you speak now let's
28:38 - try it so
28:39 - talk about this maybe cloud functions
28:41 - and let's see if your audio is working
28:43 - yeah so you know cloud function is
28:45 - basically it's you're able to
28:47 - create similar is very small
28:49 - functionalities and hopefully that you
28:50 - probably guys can hear me well now
28:52 - very small functionalities it's kind of
28:54 - like aws lambda
28:56 - functions except this is now with google
28:58 - and so you can create what kind of
29:00 - what kind of small applications can they
29:01 - create with that quasi you could create
29:03 - actually as
29:04 - big of applications as you want like
29:06 - crazy
29:07 - so i mean you can literally build a
29:09 - application like twitch
29:11 - using so this is guys this is getting
29:13 - into the world of server
29:14 - serverless um and when you get into
29:18 - serverless architecture
29:20 - i think this is where all modern
29:22 - development is actually going
29:24 - and if you guys want to be on the true
29:26 - bleeding edge and be
29:27 - one of the most highly paid and sought
29:29 - after people
29:30 - please start learning all serverless
29:34 - as of today as of now
29:37 - because your app can scale and you don't
29:39 - have to pay for anything that's not
29:41 - being used
29:42 - so if you have functions in your app
29:45 - that are not being run
29:47 - if you just host them on let's say
29:49 - heroku
29:50 - well you have to pay for every single
29:52 - function every single line of code that
29:53 - you have in your app
29:55 - now contrast that with
29:58 - using cloud functions unless a user
30:02 - actually activates that function uh
30:04 - maybe like let's say they
30:06 - charge their card and you have like a
30:07 - stripe function that runs to charge
30:09 - their card for the transaction
30:12 - that piece of code will not run until
30:14 - the user
30:15 - interacts with it it's almost like it's
30:17 - sleeping
30:18 - and then as soon as they use it boom now
30:21 - it runs and it gets
30:22 - activated and you get charged for it at
30:24 - that time
30:25 - so you can take a big company and
30:27 - instead of them spending 100 million
30:29 - dollars a year
30:30 - you can cut them down to maybe 50
30:32 - million dollars a year
30:34 - just by moving to a server-less
30:36 - architecture and it's so much more
30:38 - scalable
30:39 - programming like this is a lot more fun
30:41 - a lot more
30:43 - bug-free and error-free so
30:46 - really look into serverless
30:47 - architectures and
30:50 - again your app you can build as massive
30:52 - of an app or as small of an app
30:54 - as you can think of using cloud
30:55 - functions yeah
30:58 - yeah so let's move here
31:01 - now firebase also has all your storage
31:04 - okay so basically you can store
31:06 - everything all your media
31:08 - can be stored here and then it also can
31:11 - help you optimize your images
31:13 - and videos as well so i'm gonna move on
31:15 - to the next
31:16 - and it has your regular analytics
31:20 - that you expect to see in your app and
31:22 - it has all of those built in and much
31:24 - easier to use than aws you guys
31:26 - i built applications with aws and to
31:29 - this day i'm trying to figure out how to
31:30 - use the freaking cloud
31:32 - cloud log or whatever it's so freaking
31:35 - complicated dude
31:37 - it's very complicated man i still myself
31:39 - like have a hard time with this
31:40 - all i know is how to launch an ec2
31:42 - instance that's pretty much it
31:44 - yeah and i don't know why they don't
31:47 - just make everything
31:48 - super super simple and basic but with
31:52 - this you guys
31:53 - it comes built in so as long as soon as
31:55 - you launch app you don't have to do
31:56 - anything it automatically adds all the
31:57 - google analytics
31:59 - from start of your app and all the react
32:02 - clones that we actually built have
32:05 - google analytics
32:06 - installed in them and it tracks them and
32:08 - then when it comes to testing
32:10 - this is the best set of testing suite
32:13 - that you could ever imagine
32:14 - it could literally test your app
32:16 - concurrently on like
32:18 - thousands of different types of devices
32:20 - for you
32:21 - and then it tells you the results of all
32:23 - of those tests and lets you know if
32:25 - there's any problems with it
32:26 - or if it's not responsive or whatever
32:28 - there may be
32:34 - and yeah so you can do a b testing with
32:37 - firebase cloud messaging in-app
32:38 - messaging and uh
32:40 - you know it's time for firebase to
32:42 - sponsor us so guys please reach out to
32:44 - them
32:45 - yeah fire come on let's go yep
32:49 - so somebody's saying yep
32:52 - people can one use firebase for
32:54 - production
32:56 - yes you can use firebase for production
32:58 - you guys this is why i'm saying like
32:59 - instacart
33:00 - right instacart uses firebase and twitch
33:04 - uses firebase
33:05 - and a lot of big companies use it and
33:08 - somebody said
33:09 - how much uh does firebase support sms
33:11 - whatsapp push notifications
33:13 - or or two-factor authentication so
33:16 - push notifications that's something else
33:18 - you have to look for something else for
33:19 - push notifications
33:21 - but firebase will be able there to to
33:23 - save the notifications there so
33:25 - um yeah and in fact two-factor
33:28 - application as well you can just set up
33:29 - factor auth with firebase because that
33:32 - is where you have google authentication
33:33 - you know
33:34 - facebook authentication and both of
33:36 - those support to factor off
33:39 - exactly now you guys i do want to
33:42 - mention
33:42 - one thing if you guys are
33:45 - interested in learning about all of
33:48 - these things like
33:49 - javascript and you are also interested
33:51 - in
33:52 - let me actually take you off nas just
33:54 - because i think it's gonna cut you
33:56 - off so you can quit your video actually
33:58 - if you want okay if you guys are
33:59 - interested
34:00 - in learning how to become a
34:03 - developer and go from zero to your first
34:07 - one hundred thousand dollars
34:08 - and whether you do that in six months
34:10 - twelve months or three years or five
34:12 - years
34:13 - i wanted we wanted to put together a
34:15 - full road map for you a step-by-step
34:17 - guide so what i recommend is definitely
34:21 - go ahead and check this
34:22 - video out we've put together a free
34:25 - exclusive training for you
34:27 - and it's called top three mistakes to
34:28 - avoid when becoming a javascript
34:30 - developer
34:31 - and it gives you a full roadmap how you
34:35 - can take your javascript or any coding
34:37 - skills and then turn that into cash
34:39 - so the link is actually in the
34:41 - description below and you guys can just
34:43 - go ahead
34:44 - click register at the bottom and
34:46 - register
34:47 - for this training and again it's a free
34:50 - training
34:51 - just super value packed so i did want to
34:53 - let you guys know of that hopefully
34:55 - that is valuable to you with that said
34:59 - let's continue so
35:02 - firebase guys it's free fast and
35:05 - easy to use alright so as easy as that
35:11 - now let's talk devops nas
35:14 - all right guys so what is devops
35:17 - now if you actually have an idea what it
35:19 - is drop that in the comments below
35:21 - but in general what devops is it is how
35:24 - my friends is how you go
35:26 - from developing an application to
35:29 - actually then putting it to live right
35:31 - think of it as like let's say you just
35:32 - developed facebook
35:34 - right and you want to put a lot for
35:35 - everybody to see
35:37 - and use right the whole process between
35:40 - development to putting it there is
35:43 - devops right
35:44 - and that includes things like for
35:45 - example right like building it right so
35:48 - if you
35:49 - right there right yeah section and then
35:52 - you
35:52 - go ahead and go to continuous
35:54 - integration and then go
35:55 - ahead and go to deployment and then you
35:58 - operate
35:59 - then you get feedback right and based on
36:02 - feedback you can
36:03 - then continues and continues and
36:07 - continues and if you go to the next
36:09 - slide
36:11 - and we're gonna touch base on all of
36:13 - these types of technologies as well so
36:15 - like
36:15 - you're gonna need to learn about things
36:17 - like docker or kubernetes or
36:20 - jira and you guys might have heard of
36:22 - selenium or jenkins
36:24 - all of this type of stuff right gate
36:26 - github gitlab all of these
36:28 - are things that you kind of have to know
36:30 - like git for example
36:31 - is a need every developer needs to know
36:34 - this
36:35 - so let's move on to the next one yeah
36:38 - for the this one what is continuous
36:40 - integration now right
36:42 - this is where you guys we talked about
36:43 - get right this is where your
36:46 - your version control of your application
36:48 - so think of it like that's where you
36:49 - store your code okay
36:50 - so that kind of it all kind of comes
36:52 - from there then your code gets uploaded
36:54 - to github
36:55 - okay from github what we can do is we
36:58 - can actually do unit testing
37:00 - now what is unit testing kazi unit
37:03 - testing
37:04 - is you basically take any part of your
37:06 - code
37:07 - and especially if you guys are doing
37:08 - functional programming you want to write
37:11 - tests for it and they should go and test
37:13 - if your application
37:14 - or your functions are behaving how you
37:17 - would expect it to behave
37:19 - so let's just say you made a simple form
37:22 - with
37:22 - user login where they could click
37:25 - enter their username password hit login
37:29 - and enter the site now you might have a
37:32 - test running
37:33 - using selenium or cypress data or
37:36 - whatever
37:37 - testing unit you want to use that
37:39 - testing thing will go
37:41 - and open a browser type in the correct
37:44 - username
37:44 - type in the correct password and hit log
37:47 - in
37:47 - if that works your test will pass
37:51 - if it doesn't log you in it will go your
37:54 - test has broken
37:56 - so then it will alert you send you a
37:57 - notification maybe on your mobile device
38:00 - a notification on your slack channel so
38:02 - the entire team knows that there's
38:04 - something wrong
38:05 - and then you know that you have a bug
38:07 - and then you can actually start fixing
38:09 - it so unit testing
38:10 - is really important because especially
38:12 - once your code base gets bigger and
38:14 - bigger what if you have
38:16 - i think it's easy to keep track of if
38:18 - you have 100 lines of code
38:19 - but what if your application you're
38:21 - working on has 10 000 lines of code or 1
38:24 - million lines of code
38:26 - very hard to test it unless you have
38:28 - unit testing
38:29 - built in from day one
38:32 - and it's basically there guys so that to
38:35 - prevent any problems
38:36 - when it does go live okay from a unit
38:39 - testing
38:40 - you have code analysis so you can
38:41 - actually basically check hey
38:43 - how did this develop write the code
38:45 - wasn't clearly
38:46 - written or wasn't written and so you can
38:50 - you can get kind of there code and now
38:54 - then what you got you got test coverage
38:57 - so
38:57 - it appears first in a testing right and
39:00 - what happens here is that
39:02 - how much what percentage of my code
39:06 - is covered with testing with unit tests
39:09 - right
39:09 - is it fifty percent understanding is a
39:11 - seventy percent yeah and if if a certain
39:14 - test coverage passed right a lot for
39:16 - example other companies i was i'll just
39:17 - say really quickly
39:18 - a copy that i worked with we had to make
39:20 - sure that we had 70
39:22 - test coverage right if that was passed
39:24 - then
39:25 - the last part what we did is we did a
39:28 - what
39:28 - we did a release okay that is when
39:32 - the application goes live and
39:35 - and so guys that whole circle that you
39:38 - see
39:39 - that is continuous integration a very
39:42 - big part
39:43 - of development and actually a lot of fun
39:45 - i'm not kidding i actually love it it's
39:47 - a lot of fun
39:48 - like especially if you get the hang of
39:50 - it test
39:51 - driven development they call it tdd yeah
39:54 - it's a lot of fun you guys once you
39:56 - actually learn how this thing
39:57 - works because oftentimes
40:01 - what i really like about test room and
40:03 - development is it can actually
40:05 - help you write code instead of be your
40:08 - enemy
40:09 - so the right way to do it if you want to
40:11 - do tests
40:12 - everybody has a different way but what
40:15 - you can do is you can actually write the
40:17 - test
40:18 - first i'll give you a very simple
40:20 - example
40:21 - let's say you wanted to make a sum
40:22 - function that just took a and b
40:24 - and combine them together so you could
40:26 - give this function 1 and 2
40:28 - and you should get back a 3. now you
40:30 - could actually
40:31 - write a test case for it before you even
40:33 - start writing this function
40:34 - and that will tell you somebody like
40:37 - reading the test
40:38 - and let them know like okay the data
40:40 - types this should take is numbers
40:42 - it should take two arguments it should
40:45 - return
40:45 - what the result should look like of what
40:48 - it should return you can see
40:49 - at it in the test cases so then when
40:52 - you're actually writing the code it
40:54 - makes it
40:55 - very very clear for you uh on
40:58 - what it is you're trying to achieve with
41:00 - your code it makes you very thoughtful
41:02 - of it
41:03 - yeah all right let's keep going let's
41:06 - keep going with that
41:07 - all right so let's go so github
41:10 - introduced something called github
41:11 - actions and now it's now it's built in
41:15 - um with continuous integration now have
41:17 - you looked a lot into github actions
41:20 - what the little still i hear a lot of
41:22 - people like in
41:23 - the development blood people still
41:25 - a-okay so
41:27 - yeah but it's pretty it's pretty clean
41:29 - guys how it like allows you to do lots
41:31 - of workflows in an automated way
41:33 - something to definitely look into
41:35 - anything any times you guys have new
41:37 - releases of things
41:38 - i think it's good to kind of jump on it
41:41 - even as a hobby play around with it
41:42 - because if it's something
41:44 - truly useful it can give you a big edge
41:46 - on other developers
41:49 - like one big thing you guys can do one
41:50 - big thing you guys can do is like for
41:51 - example let's say
41:52 - you just pushed your code right to
41:54 - github you can create a github action
41:56 - that will right away
41:58 - deploy to like
42:02 - right so that's just something that you
42:04 - can you know wanna
42:05 - you can use yup exactly
42:09 - now let's continue so let's talk dev
42:11 - stuff
42:12 - now there are lots of different things
42:15 - like
42:15 - design libraries so the big ones are
42:18 - material ui
42:20 - semantic and bootstrap
42:22 - [Music]
42:23 - these are the most popular libraries
42:27 - ever and they all actually support
42:30 - react and they have native react
42:34 - you know things that are built in so you
42:36 - can actually install bootstrap into your
42:38 - react app and then use it natively or
42:40 - you could install material ui natively
42:43 - and use it with your react app so let's
42:46 - continue
42:47 - now what is node and what is npm nas
42:50 - all right so guys right that node is
42:54 - the backend kind of the framework
42:57 - back in applications okay and npm
43:01 - actually goes hand in hand with node to
43:04 - install packages so let's say there's a
43:07 - maybe there is a reaction
43:08 - there's like a bootstrap you know uh
43:10 - package you want to install
43:12 - or maybe there's your ui package onto
43:15 - so npm is there to manage
43:18 - all your packages that you need to
43:19 - install and that's pretty much it
43:20 - honestly that's the difference
43:22 - the difference between those yup
43:26 - exactly and now a lot of people have a
43:29 - fight between
43:30 - npm or yarn guys just pick one
43:33 - they're both amazing and that's just
43:36 - honestly on npm and
43:37 - just pick npm you just just continue
43:39 - with it yeah that's it just pick npm and
43:42 - you're good to go
43:43 - now which code editor should i use adam
43:46 - i've used adam i've used sublime i've
43:48 - used visual studio code
43:50 - sublime [ __ ] sublime
43:53 - just because of how many times it asks
43:54 - me to pay for it
43:57 - um adam is really good but
44:01 - you know you know what i'm talking about
44:02 - right now is that yeah
44:04 - it's okay there we go yeah guys give
44:07 - some
44:08 - fire down in the comments for vs code
44:11 - yep so vs code then
44:14 - extensions are so easy but if i could
44:16 - just name one extension that puts it
44:18 - above
44:19 - everything is live yeah like
44:22 - just that one extension will clearly
44:25 - prove to you why
44:26 - vs code is superior to pretty much every
44:29 - other editor
44:30 - out there on the planet just that alone
44:33 - but there's tons of other i'll i love it
44:36 - for it's lightweight
44:37 - along with its being super extensible
44:40 - i can install vim with one click and i'm
44:43 - just up and running
44:44 - and so much more so vs code is the way
44:47 - to go
44:48 - and here are these extensions you must
44:51 - use these are like highly recommended
44:54 - so first of all i would highly recommend
44:57 - you guys get live share
44:59 - especially if you code with somebody
45:02 - another one i really like and use a lot
45:05 - is prettier
45:06 - so this is for every single time i hit
45:08 - save my code automatically gets
45:09 - formatted
45:13 - brackets because when i switched over to
45:15 - javascript it was so annoying how many
45:17 - squiggly brackets and semicolons you
45:20 - guys have
45:21 - in python it's all within indentation
45:25 - so it always confused me just to all the
45:28 - squigglies like which squiggly is
45:30 - closing which squiggly you know it was
45:31 - like
45:32 - give me a headache this solves that
45:35 - problem
45:36 - because every squiggly or every bracket
45:38 - gets every parentheses you have gets a
45:40 - color
45:42 - and then you can see oh the red one
45:43 - matches and closes the red one i'm good
45:45 - to go
45:47 - and the last one here that i want to
45:49 - talk about
45:50 - is uh so of course live server get this
45:54 - extension as well so then you can just
45:55 - have kind of hard reloading built in
45:57 - and then this one is the react one for
45:59 - es7
46:00 - snippets and this allows you to do cool
46:03 - things where you can actually write in
46:04 - something like rfce
46:06 - hit tab and then boom it just like
46:08 - writes a full component for
46:10 - you in react so that's insane
46:14 - yeah super nice
46:17 - so those are the so the in when it comes
46:20 - to linters and formatters you need
46:22 - is you know prettier we talked about it
46:25 - and then
46:25 - eslint and then seven snippets
46:31 - and we've talked about this live code
46:34 - sharing or pair programming
46:35 - super useful for that and now you might
46:38 - be asking how do i learn
46:40 - so how do you learn nas and what are we
46:42 - seeing here
46:43 - yeah guys so the first thing the first
46:46 - and easiest way to learn is obviously
46:47 - going to be through youtube
46:49 - just as you are doing it here guys you
46:52 - are
46:52 - learning through a youtube platform
46:54 - that's number one and second way is
46:56 - going to be through what let's keep
46:57 - going on the next slide
46:59 - that is going to be through community
47:01 - yeah a very
47:02 - important i always say that community is
47:03 - probably one of the most important
47:04 - things that developer can have
47:06 - so right so for example join a slack
47:08 - community of developers join a discorded
47:10 - community of developers
47:12 - a facebook community linkedin community
47:13 - internet community any of those
47:15 - communities you're going to connect
47:16 - make friends and also learn a lot
47:20 - but hold on hold on give it a second
47:22 - give it a second
47:24 - you will have the opportunity to
47:25 - potentially even get a
47:27 - job as well that is
47:31 - the biggest one okay and then
47:34 - with those communities in mind the third
47:37 - community is going to be
47:38 - what let's keep going the next one
47:45 - amazing community all right take it
47:49 - our community is lit as [ __ ] let me
47:52 - actually show you guys
47:54 - let me show you um
47:58 - actually a nice transition into our
48:00 - community
48:01 - nice slides whoever did them i think
48:03 - sunny huh
48:05 - so guys look at this community it's
48:07 - always just lit
48:08 - like sonya deep just shared his
48:10 - experience
48:12 - and he goes an e-learning company here
48:14 - in my country paid me
48:16 - paid him to take youtube sessions
48:19 - to learn coding that is sick so boom
48:23 - there is go ahead and somewhat deep
48:26 - actually
48:27 - you guys don't don't know here but
48:28 - somehow deep actually got a job at
48:30 - expedia
48:32 - whoa are you serious yep yeah we get a
48:34 - job at expedia
48:35 - as a developer i think two months two
48:38 - months after joining javascript
48:40 - after joining profile javascript bro
48:43 - oh that makes me so happy bro
48:46 - i know right guys i gotta get on a call
48:48 - with this guy guys give somebody give
48:50 - somebody but like a like
48:52 - or give somebody a high five in the
48:54 - comments below because he's
48:56 - killing it let's party for something
48:58 - deep you guys i know we don't have nas
48:59 - here but i'll do the dancing for him
49:01 - hey hey let's go let's go wait wait wait
49:06 - oh [ __ ] nas is here wait okay we can see
49:09 - you in the middle
49:11 - nice so guys samia deep this is awesome
49:14 - guys the community is just
49:15 - really really great so you guys can see
49:18 - whether you're posting
49:19 - technical questions we are responding to
49:22 - you and helping you out or
49:23 - you guys can be posting and sharing your
49:25 - wins the coaching calls homework
49:27 - assignments
49:28 - guys at the end of the day look it
49:30 - doesn't matter i'm just going to get
49:31 - real with you here
49:32 - doesn't matter whether you join the
49:34 - profit of a javascript community
49:36 - or any other community what's important
49:38 - is that you become
49:39 - a part of a community you become a part
49:43 - of a family essentially if you think
49:44 - about
49:45 - dancers how they get good at it is they
49:46 - join a dancing community
49:49 - people who become really people who
49:50 - become really good at anything are parts
49:53 - of like community they're around those
49:54 - people who have the skill that you want
49:57 - to have or did they want to have
49:59 - and so that's the key thing here for you
50:01 - guys that's the thing that is important
50:04 - and kazi how can they join the community
50:06 - like this by the way oh
50:07 - if you guys want to join our profit with
50:10 - javascript community it's
50:11 - very simple you guys you can go to this
50:14 - page over here
50:15 - here is the link at the top the link is
50:18 - going to be also in the description but
50:19 - it's our course
50:20 - called profit with javascript and
50:24 - really the biggest thing about this
50:26 - course if i can just give you one thing
50:29 - is that we actually you know of course
50:31 - we give you the technical training and
50:33 - the live
50:33 - calls which are huge but we actually
50:36 - help you make an
50:37 - income with it that's our number one
50:39 - goal
50:40 - we want you to have your skills
50:43 - on this side meet practicality and
50:47 - ability to make an income
50:49 - that's profit with javascript in a
50:51 - nutshell
50:53 - so if you're even slightly curious
50:56 - go ahead and check this page out and
50:59 - watch this video it's lit
51:00 - and with that said let's just jump back
51:02 - into the training
51:05 - dope dope dope now what is tutorial hell
51:09 - now
51:09 - people talk about this often do you know
51:11 - about this
51:12 - i don't know about this i've been there
51:15 - guys if you
51:16 - let us know in the comments but
51:18 - basically it's just you want to become a
51:19 - developer right
51:21 - you're learning a lot of new things and
51:23 - at the same time what's going on
51:25 - is you're just watching a lot of youtube
51:26 - tutorials one stop
51:28 - one after the other one after the other
51:32 - and so you definitely definitely want to
51:35 - get away from that
51:36 - right build watch the target at the same
51:39 - time
51:40 - build a project joining another
51:42 - community so i think nas
51:44 - is slightly wrong on this one i think
51:47 - what this actually is is once a
51:50 - developer passes away and they were a
51:52 - bad developer that's where they go
51:54 - to go to tutorial hell
51:57 - now guys you want to master the
52:00 - fundamentals all right make sure you
52:02 - master them and don't move past until
52:05 - you master them and this is
52:06 - everybody's nightmare i think this is
52:08 - actually what happens when you die as a
52:10 - developer and you were a bad
52:12 - developer you know this is what
52:15 - your eternity just loops over again and
52:18 - again and again
52:19 - so things like this make sure you
52:21 - understand them like
52:22 - what is a git merge and how to deal with
52:24 - it
52:25 - i i i think that if you i honestly think
52:28 - that if somebody's an expert at git
52:29 - merge they can just get a job
52:31 - just for knowing how to get merged as an
52:33 - expert
52:35 - yeah definitely good like i feel like
52:38 - it's that important
52:42 - or get pushed you know push or get
52:44 - pulled you know exactly
52:46 - and here we got we got some other stuff
52:49 - uh steve says no they become a project
52:51 - manager that's hilarious
52:52 - the hell did i go to now why you need to
52:55 - know
52:56 - get and hit up github you guys get
53:00 - is how i think of it is a time machine
53:03 - also in a video game you have saves and
53:05 - checkpoints
53:06 - when your character dies wouldn't it
53:09 - suck that after you spent 10 hours into
53:11 - a game you would have to start
53:12 - from zero that would suck that's why
53:16 - developers invented uh savings and
53:18 - checkpoint
53:19 - so when you your character dies in a
53:21 - video game you can start from the last
53:23 - checkpoint
53:25 - when it comes to get in your software if
53:27 - you don't do that you're not really
53:29 - saving along the way
53:30 - so if your code breaks at some point
53:32 - application breaks
53:34 - you can never go back to when things
53:36 - were working and you're permanently
53:38 - screwed
53:39 - and the company can lose millions of
53:41 - dollars
53:42 - but if you understand how git works
53:44 - essentially just like a time machine so
53:46 - you can actually go
53:47 - back in time to when things were working
53:49 - just fine and you can also be
53:52 - working with other developers at the
53:54 - same time working on
53:56 - three different features so developer
53:58 - one can be working on the ability to add
54:01 - user login developer two can be adding
54:05 - the functionality for the app to be
54:07 - hosted online or or something
54:09 - right and then at some point they can
54:12 - actually
54:12 - merge both of those things at the same
54:14 - time and now both of those
54:15 - functionalities are added simultaneously
54:18 - into the app so git is an extremely
54:22 - important thing to learn and one
54:23 - important note i want to make is get is
54:27 - i repeat not git is not
54:30 - github yeah well wait so
54:33 - what is the difference i thought it was
54:35 - github so the difference between git
54:38 - and github you guys is github is
54:41 - literally think of it like dropbox for
54:44 - code think of it like google drive
54:48 - for code you just save your code on
54:51 - github
54:52 - that is it get
54:55 - is what is version control so if you get
54:57 - in an interview and you don't know the
54:59 - difference
55:00 - i will come and fire you yeah good luck
55:03 - good luck i
55:09 - online version forget that's pretty much
55:12 - it yup
55:13 - exactly now what is a pre processor
55:17 - you guys so preprocessors are things
55:20 - that allows you to process your css so
55:22 - there are things like sas
55:24 - and they gave you some additional
55:25 - functionality post css
55:27 - and less what was cool what's cool about
55:30 - them is they can allow you to do really
55:32 - like fancy things in a fast way and
55:36 - they also give you ability to add in
55:38 - variables to your css but
55:40 - a lot of that functionality now is
55:42 - coming natively
55:43 - where now you can actually just add
55:45 - variables in your css
55:47 - so nas do you know what the point of
55:49 - using a preprocessor for you would be
55:52 - yeah so for sas we actually initially
55:55 - enough we actually went over with this
55:57 - in a recent coaching call but the reason
55:59 - why you
56:00 - you would use for example like sas or
56:01 - last or post css guys
56:04 - is because think of it as like it's like
56:06 - i see it as like
56:07 - css on steroids and it is what makes
56:11 - css scalable meaning
56:15 - you can write huge application with
56:18 - css right for example for example one
56:21 - one big
56:21 - thing you got to consider is like
56:23 - bootstrap or material ui
56:26 - how do you think they are written they
56:28 - are written with sas
56:30 - right because there you can have
56:33 - variables
56:34 - you can have mixins we call it right you
56:37 - can have
56:37 - it's like basically having javascript
56:39 - functionality inside
56:41 - css oh that's actually a great way to
56:44 - put it so
56:46 - javascript basically
56:49 - javascript in css almost
56:53 - yeah functionality in css nice
56:57 - okay hopefully that makes it really
56:58 - clear for you guys i think that's
57:00 - a great explanation for using these
57:03 - types of things like sass
57:05 - or less yep beautiful yeah
57:08 - all right let's move forward now style
57:10 - components nas what are these
57:12 - so style components that is what we have
57:15 - in react
57:16 - right and basically what you would do is
57:19 - you would create
57:20 - components and you would actually style
57:23 - the components within
57:24 - javascript right so when you build react
57:28 - applications um you don't necessarily
57:30 - build you sometimes you build
57:31 - sometimes you do have css within css
57:33 - files but sometimes you can also have
57:35 - css within the javascript file too
57:38 - that's something you should guys look
57:39 - into like
57:40 - if you're gonna learn react you're gonna
57:42 - learn style components
57:44 - yep and react uses something called jsx
57:47 - which
57:47 - allows you to be able to do all those
57:49 - things in javascript as well
57:51 - exactly dope and then we also
57:54 - and what are css modules uh the css
57:58 - modules that is basically you can create
58:02 - i i like to call them partials right so
58:05 - you can so for example if you have sas
58:08 - that that you know if using sas you can
58:11 - create kind of think of it as like
58:13 - you know a module for variables in css
58:16 - you can create a module for
58:18 - you know a specific you know let's say
58:20 - let's say it's you know the header right
58:23 - yeah and then you can create the main
58:24 - module we call let's say you call it the
58:26 - main module
58:27 - and then main module what does it do it
58:30 - imports
58:32 - all of the other partial modules okay so
58:36 - the header module the variable modules
58:38 - right
58:38 - it's almost like component based like
58:41 - how
58:41 - to react yeah it's like component based
58:43 - css almost
58:44 - yeah but yeah you basically split it up
58:47 - and that's it
58:48 - yeah so think of it like uh
58:51 - how components are to react
58:56 - right css modules are
59:00 - to css so kind of like that you guys
59:02 - could use them
59:04 - exactly dope and then we have bam have
59:07 - you ever used spam and ons and do you
59:09 - know
59:09 - what a good reason to use bam is so guys
59:12 - i actually have never learned about bam
59:14 - until somebody came along yes talks
59:17 - about it all the time
59:18 - sunny is a very big proponent of that
59:21 - yeah so
59:22 - yeah cause actually you go ahead and
59:23 - talk about it because i know i know you
59:25 - you've had
59:25 - dealt more with it at this point with
59:27 - yeah i use it a lot more
59:29 - i use it with sunny a bunch and bam guys
59:32 - it's a really clean way for having
59:35 - naming conventions
59:37 - it will also allow you to do things in a
59:39 - way where
59:40 - they're like you won't have conflicts as
59:42 - your app starts to scale
59:44 - it will have co naming conventions that
59:46 - are very
59:47 - very sensible and the name itself most
59:51 - of the times will make it extremely
59:52 - clear what it's doing so it's going to
59:54 - be really good for debugging
59:56 - it's going to be really good for other
59:58 - developers to be able to read your code
60:00 - they will instantly understand what all
60:02 - of your
60:03 - css designs and what all of your classes
60:06 - are meant to do
60:07 - so definitely learn bam it's going to
60:10 - help you out tremendously
60:12 - yeah and what's pwa by the way guys we
60:15 - are almost at a thousand
60:17 - likes guys let's get that to a thousand
60:19 - i think we're 800 right now
60:21 - come on let's go we're at 954
60:25 - yes yo guys we're at 954.
60:29 - if you guys if you guys could help us
60:30 - break that thousand like mark
60:32 - that would be huge thank you guys so
60:34 - much and we're currently at six six six
60:36 - people live
60:37 - the devil's number what is happening wow
60:40 - oh i think maybe we were talking about
60:41 - tutorial hell and we started detracting
60:43 - like
60:44 - a javascript satan oh man we got to be
60:47 - careful now
60:48 - now what is this pwa stuff
60:51 - yeah so that's progressive we call this
60:54 - guys progressive
60:55 - web applications okay and the
60:59 - and we i like to call them as one page
61:01 - apps
61:02 - right so if you think about it actually
61:04 - actually for example facebook
61:05 - is a progressive web app netflix is a
61:08 - progressive web app
61:10 - youtube is a progressive web app
61:14 - yeah why is it a progressive web is
61:16 - because
61:17 - it's actually one page but when you go
61:20 - to different like for example it's
61:22 - actually one think of it as one html
61:24 - page right but yeah but as you go to
61:27 - different pages certain blocks change
61:29 - yeah so guys did you notice for example
61:32 - that when you go for example on youtube
61:33 - did you notice that you when you go to
61:35 - for example video the header pretty much
61:37 - stays
61:38 - the same right the header at the top
61:41 - is the same yeah that is what makes it a
61:44 - progressive web app
61:46 - yep because it's one page and only
61:48 - certain components change
61:50 - as you kind of go to a different you
61:52 - know a different
61:53 - page on this site itself right yeah and
61:56 - yeah
61:56 - and it's very popular nowadays it is
61:58 - basically when you're going to learn how
61:59 - to become a full-stack developer
62:01 - you're going to be learning progressive
62:02 - applications super powerful
62:04 - and i think let me see actually so
62:07 - features of pewa
62:09 - it allows you to make full responsive
62:11 - and ads in browser compatibility
62:14 - it has connectivity independence so your
62:17 - app can actually work offline as well
62:20 - it has a app like interface can you can
62:23 - add it to your home screen it has push
62:25 - notifications which for some reason are
62:27 - only for android right now
62:29 - so i think apple needs to step up their
62:31 - game and then it
62:32 - allows you to make it fast using service
62:35 - workers
62:36 - now let's go on to type checkers
62:39 - and this is always a big battle between
62:41 - things like typescript and flow
62:44 - so typescript is essentially just think
62:48 - of it like a
62:50 - supercharged uh
62:53 - javascript yep okay because what
62:56 - typescript
62:57 - is you guys is if i was to draw
63:00 - it out right if we have
63:04 - this here and then i'm gonna make
63:07 - another circle inside of it yeah
63:09 - now the smaller circle inside of it is
63:12 - javascript
63:13 - the bigger circle is typescript
63:16 - so technically speaking
63:20 - typescript is actually
63:25 - is a superset of javascript
63:29 - so by definition oh crap my thing is
63:32 - blocking
63:33 - so now you guys should be able to see it
63:35 - so by definition
63:36 - it's actually javascript and then some
63:42 - and what it allows you to do is add in a
63:44 - lot of type checking that you know
63:46 - a lot of people really like languages
63:48 - like java it's strongly typed
63:50 - you can see what data types are going to
63:54 - be returned
63:55 - with every function it is a lot less
63:57 - buggy when you write your code and
63:59 - people love that functionality
64:01 - so they thought about how could they
64:02 - actually bring that to javascript so
64:05 - then it's less buggy more scalable
64:07 - and they introduced typescript yeah
64:11 - yeah so for big companies actually it's
64:13 - actually it's very popular
64:15 - so you know when you're thinking about
64:17 - tesla are you thinking about all these
64:18 - companies who are using react
64:20 - they're going to be using typescript yep
64:23 - omkar says now we see our path is slowly
64:25 - lighting
64:26 - up thank you so much for this session
64:29 - yep now let's go yeah you guys can learn
64:33 - typescript and you guys so felipe asks
64:37 - should i learn start learning typescript
64:39 - instead of javascript
64:41 - now remember it's up it is built on top
64:44 - of javascript so there's no way you can
64:46 - detach the two they're both the same
64:48 - typescript is just more but i would say
64:51 - but i would say my recommendation to
64:52 - to felipe because that's another
64:54 - question first right javascript first
64:56 - hundred percent typescript could come
64:58 - later don't worry about that
64:59 - just yet yeah yeah just get really good
65:01 - with javascript you guys and then move
65:03 - on to
65:03 - it and you guys can use it now so this
65:07 - is the fight that's happening between
65:09 - typescript and flow and
65:12 - we know who the winner is you guys
65:15 - another word for typescript
65:17 - you guys know another word another way
65:19 - of saying typescript
65:20 - it's actually hype script
65:23 - oh isn't it
65:27 - um damn man where's my sound stuff go i
65:30 - wanted to
65:31 - play the freaking air horns who stole my
65:34 - sounds
65:36 - all right i'm gonna play it right now
65:39 - all right there we go so yeah so
65:43 - typescript is super popular and the
65:46 - trend is just going like stupid which is
65:48 - why a lot of people are actually calling
65:49 - it hype
65:50 - script so i would i would just if i had
65:53 - to pick between the two i would just
65:54 - pick typescript and
65:55 - call it a day okay yeah yeah i'd agree
65:59 - with that
66:00 - let's move on now people talk about dino
66:02 - what's the hype about knowledge do you
66:04 - know about this you want to speak to it
66:05 - you want me to talk about it
66:06 - i don't know too much about dino guys
66:10 - okay cool so there is npm right
66:13 - there's npm and npm was pretty awesome
66:17 - but then the
66:18 - creator of npm was like hey man i found
66:20 - a lot of
66:21 - weird things about npm and i want to
66:23 - like take it to the next level
66:24 - and then he ended up creating dino
66:27 - [Music]
66:28 - but until it takes off and it starts
66:31 - being super popular and big companies
66:33 - start using it guys keep learning npm
66:36 - because npm is not going to be going
66:37 - anywhere anytime soon
66:39 - as a hobby and for fun you can start
66:41 - picking up dino just for
66:43 - you know you want to do something
66:44 - cutting edge new shiny object
66:46 - but keep learning npm guys keep learning
66:49 - npm
66:49 - and just keep stick to npm for now
66:54 - now webpacks you want to speak to this
66:56 - yeah so webpack guys
66:58 - is you know it's basically think of it
66:59 - as like it's a task manager for
67:01 - javascript
67:03 - so you know how you saw a lot of those
67:04 - like preprocessors so webpack is what
67:07 - allows you for example to use
67:09 - sas it allows you to for example magnify
67:12 - javascript so when i say modify i mean
67:15 - like compress
67:16 - javascript okay and this is what allows
67:18 - you to build
67:19 - you know progressive applications or
67:22 - single
67:22 - page applications okay and the reason
67:25 - why
67:26 - that is is because it's like a layer
67:29 - above your application okay
67:32 - so it runs the server right it runs
67:36 - any tasks that are needed in terms of
67:38 - like processing your css
67:40 - processing your javascript processing
67:42 - your html
67:43 - all that stuff webpack does and you know
67:47 - it's definitely one
67:48 - i would say i would say one of the
67:50 - biggest like
67:52 - developer tools that's used in you know
67:55 - in big
67:56 - in applications hundred percent
67:59 - yeah nice okay so definitely so when it
68:02 - comes to learning this should we say
68:04 - definitely learn this
68:05 - hundred percent web so in the case
68:08 - there's a few there's webpack there's
68:10 - golf and then there's grunt
68:11 - webpack is the biggest one highly
68:13 - recommend you
68:14 - i would say focus on that one so focus
68:18 - on webpack
68:19 - yes okay got it awesome so focus on
68:22 - webpack and then you guys can learn
68:24 - about other ones too but webpack is the
68:26 - most popular
68:27 - yep beautiful and then dev tools nas
68:32 - what is this do i need to know chrome i
68:34 - mean why can't i become a developer
68:36 - without knowing devtools bro what are
68:38 - you talking about oh
68:39 - man man chrome chrome chrome guys if you
68:42 - don't know chrome dev tools i don't know
68:44 - man
68:45 - um let's just say that you have to
68:47 - understand
68:48 - how to use chrome debugger how to use
68:51 - you know chrome console
68:52 - and just being able to use um
68:55 - chrome as a way to debug your website
68:58 - okay just take your lives at that you
69:00 - know
69:02 - so you just need it for debugging yeah
69:03 - super powerful and guys i'm just going
69:05 - to give you one little hack anyway
69:07 - so learn console.log which is very
69:10 - important
69:11 - and here's another one console.table
69:15 - use this one guys it's just like this is
69:17 - like a little pro tip i'll throw in
69:19 - there
69:20 - yeah amazing for visualizing your
69:22 - objects
69:24 - and arrays as a table and it's just such
69:27 - a nice
69:28 - little trick you guys can use yeah
69:31 - and console the log everything also the
69:34 - log your life
69:35 - yep yeah all right react so using the
69:38 - react profiler have you used this now do
69:39 - you know what this is
69:40 - i have not used react profile now okay
69:42 - guys so use react profiler
69:45 - and now native apps and react native
69:48 - guys
69:49 - if you do if you want to build native
69:52 - apps it's really easy to do it to react
69:55 - as pretty much
69:56 - all the apps that you build with react
69:57 - are almost native and ready to go
70:00 - and be translated into a mobile app
70:02 - anyway
70:03 - yeah i think i said react actually tesla
70:05 - app is built with react native
70:07 - oh really tesla is yep yep okay damn let
70:11 - me put that
70:12 - tesla build damn nice
70:16 - okay cool so let's move forward now
70:19 - electron
70:20 - is for desktop apps
70:23 - and uh here are some of the things that
70:25 - are built with electron.js okay so
70:28 - electron is it allows you to build
70:31 - desktop apps with javascript
70:33 - okay build
70:36 - holy i'm looking at right now right now
70:38 - so vs code
70:40 - vs code which slack what
70:44 - slack you didn't know that what
70:47 - no way yeah
70:50 - all of this stuff i was actually just
70:52 - gonna like write all of these out that
70:54 - they're all actually built with this
70:56 - wow insane yep
70:59 - and um steve is saying something awesome
71:02 - he's like
71:03 - about 75 only about 75 is usable from
71:06 - react to react native so if you want to
71:08 - make something completely native
71:10 - that's something you guys should learn
71:12 - which is react native itself
71:15 - and um oh i know what the profiler is
71:19 - guys i'm sorry i don't know why i acted
71:20 - like an idiot
71:23 - where so the react profiler
71:26 - it is a chrome extension you guys can
71:28 - get and you can go to pretty much any
71:30 - app and use it in your chrome
71:33 - uh where you guys have your chrome
71:35 - console and inspector tools
71:37 - you can actually have a react profiler
71:39 - and it allows you to see
71:41 - how that app is built you can see all
71:42 - the components and everything along
71:44 - those lines
71:45 - okay so i see yeah
71:48 - so electron js is pretty damn sick
71:53 - to to learn i think you guys should
71:55 - definitely take a look into it if
71:56 - something along those lines
71:58 - interests you to make desktop apps now
72:01 - we're going to get into testing
72:03 - frameworks so now let's go for it
72:06 - yeah so obviously there's there's three
72:07 - three types of testing we have
72:09 - number one unit testing number two
72:12 - integration testing and then
72:13 - three functional testing so jest is
72:17 - definitely what is one of the
72:18 - testing frameworks that you can use for
72:20 - example for example with like react
72:22 - okay and then if you if we keep going on
72:25 - uh
72:26 - enzyme right you know you can
72:29 - looks like airbnb actually uses jest as
72:32 - well to test
72:33 - to test their code because their
72:35 - application is written in
72:37 - they're even using it to test their ui
72:40 - yeah
72:40 - yeah yeah yeah so some very a very
72:43 - powerful powerful tool there
72:45 - yep so support for hooks and
72:48 - the one you guys should use which is
72:50 - actually like super highly recommended
72:52 - and one of the best
72:53 - is this one cypress so
72:56 - if you guys want to use this is actually
72:58 - even better than selenium you guys so if
73:00 - you want to use something use cyprus.io
73:02 - for testing
73:03 - gotcha and allows you to test anything
73:06 - that runs in a browser
73:07 - and then of course you have selenium and
73:09 - there's also selenium for react so you
73:11 - guys can use selenium to test
73:13 - react apps and then there is something
73:16 - called server side rendering
73:18 - so a lot of the times if you guys want
73:20 - to go
73:21 - from a you know if you guys want to get
73:23 - to that senior level developer
73:25 - server side rendering is one of those
73:27 - things you guys should actually really
73:29 - learn about and understand and one of
73:32 - the tools you can use for it
73:33 - is called next.js
73:37 - so this is i was going to say vishnu
73:40 - vishnu has
73:40 - just donated 40 i'm not sure what what
73:43 - how much money that is
73:44 - 40 something did you see that yep thank
73:46 - you so much vishnu for the donation
73:49 - really appreciate you and let me see
73:51 - i'll take you guys
73:52 - to next.js actually and let's actually
73:55 - take a look at
73:57 - that website so boom here we go
74:01 - oh it's by versal nice okay so this is
74:05 - what it is
74:06 - it's a react framework for pre-render
74:08 - sites
74:10 - and it's the jam stack for the
74:11 - enterprise so you guys can see
74:14 - it has file system routing so
74:18 - i can actually like switch between app
74:21 - really really fast and it will
74:24 - do all of the rendering and everything
74:26 - server side so then when the user goes
74:28 - it's extremely fast
74:30 - the reason to learn it is to make your
74:32 - apps
74:33 - really really fast at a very high level
74:35 - in an english version of server side
74:37 - rendering
74:38 - is it's like a cr it basically allows
74:41 - you to make super
74:42 - lightning fast apps okay and
74:45 - think about it think of it as like you
74:46 - have a cached version of your app like
74:48 - your whole html app
74:50 - yes it's the cached version and you're
74:52 - right away displaying to the user
74:54 - as the as they are loading it exactly
74:57 - it also has next.js also has automatic
75:00 - cloud
75:01 - code splitting so if your app is online
75:03 - and there's bunch of stuff that's not
75:05 - being used or a bunch of files that the
75:07 - user is not using
75:08 - it will upload them without uploading
75:10 - those things so that way
75:12 - it's going to be super lightweight as it
75:14 - gets uploaded it'll know like whatever
75:16 - is not being used it just won't upload
75:18 - that
75:19 - for those parts so that's super powerful
75:22 - will save you a ton of space
75:24 - and make your app really really fast
75:27 - so why use it it's good for static
75:30 - exporting
75:31 - pre-rendering it requires pretty much no
75:34 - configuration on your end it's fully
75:36 - extensible
75:38 - allows you to do css in javascript
75:41 - it is ready for production and here are
75:43 - the companies that are using it
75:45 - next.js so trulia netflix
75:48 - github twitch docker
75:52 - starbucks hulu and the list
75:55 - goes on so definitely something you guys
75:58 - should look into
76:00 - and then here i think that you can even
76:01 - go to their showcase
76:03 - and uh they show you like what are all
76:06 - the so here's like jobs.netflix.com page
76:09 - is built with next.js yeah
76:13 - so you can see and you can see basically
76:14 - just how fast it loads all the data
76:16 - right away
76:17 - yeah right again because it is a static
76:21 - pretty much
76:21 - site let's see what type of jobs
76:24 - uh netflix have because i'm about to get
76:27 - a job there bro
76:28 - i'm about to leave clever programmer
76:30 - let's apply yeah
76:32 - let's apply forget about these live
76:34 - streams
76:35 - yeah uh i mean over bye guys yeah guys
76:38 - sorry i'm gonna apply here all right
76:44 - so let's go back do you guys want some
76:45 - music in these live streams
76:47 - guys what are you guys thinking because
76:48 - i'm thinking we should start adding some
76:49 - music to this thing
76:51 - and make it a lot more like upbeat maybe
76:53 - some dubstep in the back
76:55 - savage i'm just gonna be i'm just gonna
76:56 - be dancing all the time man yeah i want
76:58 - to add music to this stuff bro he goes
77:00 - you guys are doing great
77:01 - really looking forward to learn and
77:02 - enhance my technical skills from you
77:04 - guys
77:05 - thank you so much appreciate you
77:08 - all right somebody asks how to choose
77:11 - between
77:11 - client side and server side you there's
77:14 - you're going to have to learn both
77:16 - if you want to build full stack
77:17 - applications yeah
77:20 - and some there's a client side first and
77:22 - then learn server side trust me
77:25 - yeah run learn yeah exactly that's a
77:26 - good order to do it in do you want to
77:28 - speak to static side generators nas
77:30 - yeah so static slide generators is it's
77:32 - kind of kind of
77:33 - what you guys saw with next js but
77:35 - imagine you kind of have
77:37 - imagine you have a website right that
77:40 - shows some data
77:41 - right um well what what happens is that
77:43 - excite generator will actually
77:45 - take the data from a database create a
77:48 - static html
77:49 - site and then we'll be able to display
77:51 - to a user
77:52 - okay yeah and again the reason why we do
77:54 - this is because
77:55 - of speed okay so instead of us trying to
77:58 - go
77:59 - every time a user tries to get some you
78:02 - know a site instead of us trying to go
78:04 - to the database
78:04 - grabbing grabbing data from a database
78:06 - and then you know show the html
78:09 - the html is right there displayed
78:12 - for them and so that my friends is why
78:14 - kind of like you use
78:15 - aesthetic side generators yep exactly
78:19 - now there are the most popular static
78:21 - side generator right now
78:23 - is gatsby very very powerful
78:27 - i think helpful to learn that this is
78:30 - for server side so
78:31 - this is next.js there's jekyll next
78:34 - is i believe it's basically like next js
78:37 - but for vue
78:38 - you got hugo gatsby so one thing i'll
78:41 - recommend
78:42 - is if you want to do static site
78:45 - use gatsby if you want uh
78:48 - speed in a dynamic app that you're
78:50 - building and you want more scalability
78:52 - pick next js so i think between these
78:55 - these are the two i would recommend for
78:57 - you guys
78:58 - yeah and it gatsby actually works very
79:00 - nicely with react as well so
79:02 - that's true yep so there you go and uh
79:05 - if you guys are still not sure how to
79:07 - get
79:07 - started uh let's all we can talk about
79:10 - how to make money as a developer so
79:13 - this in we covered this in a lot of
79:15 - detail in the last live stream we're not
79:17 - going to go too much into detail on this
79:19 - but one of the ways you guys can
79:20 - actually make an income
79:21 - is by teaching coding to people and
79:25 - i'm going to just list out some
79:26 - platforms that are good for this if you
79:28 - guys
79:28 - are interested you can pause it and view
79:30 - this but i already covered a lot of this
79:32 - in front of developer guide
79:34 - so i'll just talk about like some
79:36 - resources you guys can go
79:38 - is facebook groups instagram wise and
79:40 - take lessons people per hour craigslist
79:42 - upwork
79:43 - fiverr or linkedin or some other ones
79:46 - you guys can take a screenshot of this
79:48 - but these are really good resources for
79:50 - going and getting jobs as a developer
79:54 - even if you're a beginner and you don't
79:55 - have actual job because
79:57 - getting a full-time job guys will take
79:59 - you a long time will take you
80:01 - you know most for most people it takes
80:02 - them one to two years so
80:04 - in the start i think what i recommend is
80:07 - you
80:08 - learn coding and then you can teach it
80:10 - to other people and charge them
80:11 - whether they're high school students
80:13 - college students boo
80:15 - they're going to coding boot camp
80:18 - you can definitely help them and just
80:20 - with these two platforms alone
80:22 - wise and and take lessons i personally
80:25 - before i started clever programmer was
80:27 - able to scale my income to 104
80:29 - 000 per year and then
80:32 - i added in craigslist and this is where
80:35 - i started actually
80:36 - i used craigslist to freelance and
80:40 - i started adding and with craigslist i
80:42 - was able to take
80:43 - my income even above that so i i would
80:46 - use it to land
80:47 - contracts or freelancing clients so
80:50 - that gave me another source of income
80:52 - and those are the ones i really really
80:54 - recommend for you guys as well
80:56 - if you guys want to go more on the
80:57 - freelancing side then you can go heavier
81:00 - on upwork nice
81:04 - number two way of making an income from
81:06 - coding
81:07 - is how nas freelancing guys
81:11 - so that means basically you are a person
81:14 - and you
81:14 - are getting work by yourself
81:17 - from clients right so you're going up
81:19 - you're using websites like
81:21 - upwork like freelancer.com like toptail
81:25 - and you're literally just kind of going
81:26 - there seeing what work needs to be done
81:29 - and then applying and then saying hey
81:31 - guys hey
81:32 - hey client i can actually do this work
81:34 - and this is how much i charge
81:36 - and that's pretty much it so it's very
81:37 - it's very much different
81:39 - from because it's just like basically
81:40 - it's project by project basis
81:43 - yep exactly and then of course you guys
81:46 - can go the route
81:47 - which is step three for a lot of people
81:49 - is getting a permanent job or
81:51 - you know even if it's not permanent
81:52 - getting a full-time job essentially
81:55 - and so that's really like level three
81:58 - like if i had to put it
82:00 - i think you could teach people as a
82:03 - beginner
82:04 - um number two you can freelance as kind
82:07 - of intermediate developer and then i
82:09 - think for full time you need to be a
82:11 - little bit more advanced
82:12 - because nobody's going to like want to
82:14 - pay you a lot of money if you're either
82:16 - not
82:16 - advanced or not you know
82:19 - have some experience so freelancing and
82:22 - teaching
82:23 - how allows you to get that experience
82:25 - i'm going to also go through this pretty
82:26 - fast but
82:27 - i think that you should go in this order
82:30 - learn coding
82:31 - then learn to coach and that should put
82:33 - you at 3k per month income
82:35 - learn the freelance that should put you
82:37 - at 5k a month income
82:39 - so this stacks on top of each other so
82:41 - this 3k
82:42 - and 5k you should be at 8k a month
82:46 - and um and again guys it's very rare for
82:49 - people
82:50 - but if you actually follow this roadmap
82:52 - and put in the work it's very possible
82:53 - for you
82:54 - and then if you have a job you can be
82:56 - making 7k a month from a job but at
82:58 - which point you could choose to keep all
82:59 - three sources of income
83:01 - or say no to all your clients say no to
83:03 - all this and just be happy with the 7k a
83:05 - month
83:06 - or you could keep your freelancing plus
83:08 - this
83:09 - and now you have 13k a month coming in
83:12 - or
83:13 - you could choose to say no to your
83:15 - freelancing keep some clients on the
83:17 - side they're teaching coding to and this
83:19 - and now that puts you at 10k really like
83:22 - whatever flavor suits you but the
83:24 - potential
83:25 - if you put in ridiculous hours of work
83:27 - and time
83:28 - that your potential income could really
83:30 - be 15k a month or more
83:36 - so with that said you guys if you guys
83:38 - want to be able to actually learn
83:40 - and go ahead you can take a picture of
83:41 - this and
83:43 - i added in a nice little camera for you
83:45 - guys here

Cleaned transcript:

i'm here with your boy sonny and your boy nas what is up everybody guys we are so excited to bring you the full stack developer guide the ultimate manifesto of developer guides for you are you guys ready are you ready guys we are so excited to bring this value bombs to you what are we going to be covering in this sonny so guys we're going to be covering front end development backend development a bit of devops we've got some stuff involved around which language do you pick i know a lot of there's a lot of different things out there like different frontend languages back in languages we're going to go through a bunch of them why and which ones you need to be worried about and take like put your time towards um yeah nice what do you have to say about that yeah it's going to be well what i got to say is we're going to cover the front end we're going to cover the back end we're going to give you guys the road map on how to go ahead and get to become a full stack developer that is the goal here guys yep and guys lots of technologies okay so just to roadmap a little bit we're going to be talking about react javascript firebase things like material ui command line angular bootstrap node making money with freelancing mongodb so we're going to talk about things like c nosql and sql right over here java python and heroku git and amazon services is going to be another one of those things we're going to touch base on in frameworks like vue.js or which editors you should use packages like npm and many more things so with that said guys let's actually just start moving forward so it's gonna be your roadmap to becoming a full stack developer in 2020 um and let me put us right over here so you guys can see us okay awesome so let's move forward now what should they do nas before we continue guys here's what i want you to do i literally want you to take your phone okay take this phone right here right here and i literally want you to chug it to chug it right away from you chug it on your bed chuck it out your window okay smash it out of your window just break your phone well most of all the guys focus because it's going to be very important put your phone under not disturb and let's get this going yep exactly all right so a lot of people are like where do i begin guys first thing we want to say is it doesn't matter just start and we want we do want to talk about what does it mean what does it mean when somebody says full stack what is the meaning of that so sunny talk us through what it means when somebody says full stack so when somebody says full stack guys they're talking about some so we're talking about frontend development backend development and then a few extra additions to that so we're talking about things like databases how you can push information into a database pull it from a database set that all up and then we're also talking about something called devops so some of you guys might actually not know what devops is we're going to go ahead and cover that today and show you why it's useful why people get paid a lot of money to know these sort of skills and we're also going to cover um some interesting things like mobile app development so that all comes under what we call a full stack development developer and yeah with that said i hope you guys are excited and here are the salaries guys for people who are becoming developers in united states for full stack developers salaries so if we look over here years by experience united states now it doesn't matter if you have less than one year of experience you can still be looking at about 92 000 a year and between and any more than that and you're talking about a lot of income like 136 000 or more now i know a lot of you guys are gonna be like but i am not in united states how can i do this doesn't my life suck uh no i mean like you can still get jobs in different places like united states remote jobs you guys can get jobs in other countries as well like germany or united kingdom or canada so there are lots of markets that are actually available to you now what are what is what am i looking at over here now is with these top companies so these top companies guys right we got what we got tesla we got cisco we got idc technologies right fannie mae and what you can see right you know the the salary right even though the average salary right now we have is 92k right which you can go if you go for those top companies you're you're looking at 173k 148k 145 so you're looking at around 150k average 70. my bad we were blocking it but now you guys should be able to see it yeah it's just simply insane from what from literally from that's a crazy salary right so yeah just something to definitely something to think about yep let's move forward now what's this sunny so on this page uh my screen's a bit slow so front end versus back end and we're looking at the two people slapping each other [Laughter] so this is a very interesting image okay guys you're going to have a lot of like heat between front end developers and back end developers but what we want to show you today is that if you actually go ahead and master the skills of a front end developer and you pick up some backend developments because all you flip it around and do it the other way whichever side you prefer we're going to show you why that's so valuable and why you can take that skill and run with it with that said guys if you're interested in learning frontend development i'm actually going to be jumping on a react coaching call inside of proper javascript right now so the link is in the description and with that i'm going to be hopping onto that coaching call right now if you're interested to go check it out and i'll leave you guys to go and crush this hey peace out sunny yeah peace out sunny thanks for jumping in guys and if you guys give it up for sunny and just smash the like button for sunny all right smash the like button and subscribe break that like button all right now finally nas can get his uh logo underneath him peace out sonny boom there we go popped in place all right hey hey we got more room for each other bro look at all this room what am i gonna do nice let's keep it rocking and rolling you guys so let's start we're going to start off with front end now let's take it away all right guys so the three most important things guys when you're thinking about front end right you're thinking about the front end view right what you see on the website and that includes what that includes html that includes css and that includes the javascript and those three are the most important things that you guys need to learn as the base foundation for a frontend developer beautiful okay i tried to give you some nice words that went along with it and now here are the job opportunities and salaries for developers so we already checked them out and i just want to show you guys some more so keep in mind guys i know a lot of you are have less than one year of experience in coding so that's why we want to show you opportunities where even with less than one year experience but a lot of hard work these salaries are possible for you okay and there are 45 000 jobs or more available right this second for developers and even if you go on a platform like upwork and just type in the word javascript for example you'll see a ton of job opportunities available to you guys so that's gonna be really really huge all right let's keep it moving forward okay so what am i looking at here with the stack overflow so guys check this out so stackoverflow does surveys every single year at hundreds of thousands of developers and javascript html css you know are literally always for the past few years have been at the top of the list right so that tells you it's just the popularity and the growth the most likely you're gonna have as you know as as the years go by and you know in the next five ten years right so i think that's just a lot super popular and it's important now what i touched on earlier for you guys it doesn't matter what countries you're in you can still be part of these job markets you could be part of usa part of canada germany united kingdom so your country doesn't really matter whether you are currently in you uh your uruguay or kenya or you are in dubai like it doesn't you know or saudi arabia or wherever like turkey your country doesn't matter you can always work for these types of countries if you want a higher paying salary and guys here are the top companies that are actually using javascript so what are these companies here now i got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay groupon right tesla netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal insane guys and half of them we already built clones for half of them already so oh yeah yeah building tons of clones for all of these now guys if you guys are enjoying this video and you want to do help us and do us a huge favor we want this video to go out to as many people as possible so please if you could just go ahead and smash that like button and just with that we can send this video out to so many other people who are trying to become developers get promotions land their dream jobs or become freelancers and start their own companies and we can all do that and be a part of it just by hitting that like button so this video goes out to them now moving forward this is overall just so guys front when we say full stack it's front end combined with backhand so let's dive into front end first now when you look at front end nowadays it it has gone like a little bit more complex than it used to be there's a lot of things you guys have to kind of know about for example of course you have to know about html css and javascript but within css these are some of the things you might have to start knowing about within javascript you might have to start knowing about frameworks like angular vue js or react i mean we will talk a lot about react a lot of our channel is pretty heavy on react as you guys will see in libraries well do you want bootstrap material ui or semantic and then in tools are you looking at npm webpack and chrome dev tools those are all and that's just that's not even all of it you know and in this video we'll go deeper into it but this is just to kind of show you guys the overall road map we're going to be looking at when we're talking about front end go ahead nas all right so guys good question what can you do with javascript first things is you can build web applications right so web applications include things like guys facebook that's a web app right we can build native apps i don't know if you know tesla the actual app for your ios and android is built with react which is insane right and you can also build server apps so server apps are your backend applications using node.js and those are very popular as well right exactly they're super powerful and now let's get into the technical nitty gritty so when it comes to html just learn the basics make a page make it work don't over complicate it so keep it simple and just get started now moving forward when we're talking about css vishal thank you for the first donation really appreciate that buddy learn how to use different layouts flexbox responsive design media queries and this is going to be part of css as you guys like learn it and then in javascript nas what's happening what we got we got obviously we got data types right so like your var your lat your cons right you've got your functions and the es6 is a very big part of it right so you have to know all the new es6 standards you got dom manipulation you got scope you got your fetch api you also got your async of weight yeah so much along with that but very important as well yeah and we're talking about es6 and those things we are also talking about things like for example you guys have probably seen these arrow functions you know that's just like a little example of what we're talking about okay cool so let's move forward now we're not going to cover too much visual and design stuff because in our if you guys want to go deep into our front end developer guide we did produce one last week i believe you guys can go on our channel and check out our front end developer guide and we just go really deep into a lot of front end stuff and this one we're gonna get to more of the back end stuff so then we can give you guys that as well so definitely check that one out now when we're looking at what is a framework [Laughter] you know what is going on here and oh by the way bojack joined um profit with javascript yesterday and he actually just said in the co in the chat he goes really loving profit with javascript so far thank you bro that's awesome i appreciate it that is amazing i was super pumped when i saw him join yesterday i was so happy wow so awesome now let's keep going so we remember we touch base on some of the front end stuff and we will touch on frameworks now so now the most popular frameworks are which ones nas we got angular obviously right then we also got vue and then we got our favorite one quasi react hey yeah and i think you know what one as you can see from here right a lot of companies are using the all three frameworks are both very popular you got for example angularjs used by companies like the guardian upwork paypal sunny react gs airbnb instagram by ubereats and then ujs alibaba grammarly giblet and guys and so much more that's just the starting of it right um so yeah all very important all very uh popular uh frameworks yep and i wrote which one is our favorite i wrote it underneath which should you choose so when it comes to framework there's a big war between the most loved frameworks the most dreaded and the most wanted under the most wanted you will see my beautiful friend react.js it is by far the most wanted and then underneath it you will see other ones like vue or angular django and all of that now all these frameworks guys are super powerful they're really really powerful but react right now is on this type of trend like you know those exponential curves that they taught us in school angular is a little bit on the downward trend and the view is doing okay the reason for that you guys is angular is a lot more opinionated and it's a framework view is a framework react is actually just a library so it's pretty much like you're just using javascript so it's extremely lightweight and then it's super powerful which is why companies like instagram and facebook are using it so this is the trend that i was referring to you guys can see here is react and then here is the react curve and this is modern according to google trends and these are actually the downloads per year and then you guys can see where downloads from where i think i don't know actually not exactly sure but here's angular i think sorry the thing is just download the general just downloading the actual library itself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what yeah um so there you go so when you think react you know react for the win so that's what we're going with and it has a really nice componentbased design to it so nas go for it yeah so one of the big things guys in react is all about managing data that's you know that's what kind of sets react apart from a lot of these like framework frameworks and it's something called redux and it's a little bit hard to understand but we're going to go to there so let's go ahead to the next thing so redux context api that is when you were able to for example properly you know store data think of it as like you know data a local data of your on your application and then kind of use it throughout your whole app so whenever you change one thing for example on the one side of the app right another thing will be able to change as well so it kind of talks in sync with each other exactly and managing data in react you guys can look into mobx as well which is kind of like next level of things but it's bleeding edge but you know it's just something optional for you to look into and as bruce buffer apparently says we have tons of live bills that we've put on youtube and you guys can check them out so we actually did a zoom clone build we did spotify clone build with react we built tick tock with react we built youtube clone with react we built tinder with react and we build a bunch of other things like netflix would react right over here and we built instagram with react and a real time chat app for facebook messenger and just yesterday we built slack realtime chat app with react so guys if you are looking to learn and react you are in the right place or if you're looking to learn just javascript in general you're in the right place yeah and i think and if you guys have any suggestions for us on what you want to see in terms of next like a next clone in react literally drop that in the comments below yep take it away nas all right so back in development so let's get so guys front end development was the first thing that we cover right that is the first part of full stack developer now the backend right that is the backend part of the application so that is the server side part of the application and so and this is like the salary of the backend developer individually you can see 127 k average salary which is pretty much comparable with the front developer just maybe a little bit higher now yeah exactly even a little bit higher sometimes yeah yeah so huge keep going all right so with backend development guys what language do we use right that's a good question so there's a lot we have python we have javascript we have go typescript rust java and so much more but i think we'll kind of differentiates back end is like now is what frameworks are we going to use right as you can see python's top one javascript's second so let's see which ones we can actually what frameworks go along with those languages so node.js one of the one of the most popular ones interestingly enough guys netflix yes netflix actually uses node.js for their whole backend structure the whole backend development structure so node.js next thing we have what let's go keep going let's keep going and so javascript as you can see right javascript is node.js and javascript allows us to do frontend and back at the same time right that was react right for front end and then back in is with node.js so very popular with that yeah so javascript can the great thing about learning javascript is it's kind of a hack like it's a little trick you're essentially learning front end and back end at the same time so if you get a javascript you're kind of getting good at both simultaneously and that makes you a full stack developer basically yep yeah and yeah keep going yeah next thing we got we got another big big popular language and then we got a bust programming language then that was next one go link java right and then yeah golden java and now at this point we've covered the let's now talk about how we store data that's a full stack developer yep so now guys here we got sql that allows you to store data and then we also have no sql on the other side so when we're talking about storing data in very basic terms think about it like a video game where you have saves and you can have checkpoints if you couldn't store data you couldn't have all the likes showing up under your instagram post if you couldn't store data you couldn't come back the next day and your instagram post would be gone yep so essentially that's storing data for some reason it took me the longest time to understand what a database was because it always just sounded complicated super complicated but it's really just a savings checkpoint in a video game okay and if you couldn't store data you won't be able to see this youtube video oh yeah yeah exactly that's a big point and so if you have so nosql database right what's cool about those is they are highly scalable they have high availability really fast performance replication and then big data capability so let's go up to here nosql and then we also got c so this is when we say nosql and sql these are the two that we got right here all right these are the two things so it's always a thing that people are debating between which way they want to go sunny and i often times kind of just go with firebase which is essentially no c it's a nosql and a sql hybrid which we'll talk about later but you know sql you got your relational tables in sql also you have to have all the tables and columns kind of predefined whereas in nosql you have a lot more flexibility you can map things out on the fly so if you're building things for your own self honestly i think it's a lot more fun to use nosql just because you're not really bounded by a lot of things and you can kind of play around with data and all of that and um and then yeah if you can switch it to a sequel at some point if you want yeah but i want to make a small addition guys both are important and both are important to learn a lot of companies are using nosql a lot of companies are also using sql so yeah definitely consider that too right like nosql you know no they're examples of nosql are like mongodb right mongodb and then you have firebase things like that and then sql you have my sequel you got postgresql yep yep those are two two top ones yeah so they're like really big all right and then you guys got graphql which is you know you start getting into the api type of world but i think graphql is important to learn there's mongodb firebase now uh nas you can talk about this so what is firebase and why is it so useful for full stack so we touched on guys that firebase is what it's a nosql database right but the reason why it's such a big part is because it is actually something called so actually go go to the right go to the right keep going keep going one more time it is a real time database that means that as you update things you will be you can basically create realtime applications like you know messenger right clone or whatsapp clone really easily without having to do like crazy you know coding or anything like that and that's what separates firebase from a lot of these other databases exactly and i already know a bunch of people are messaging like hey why don't we use aws and probably a lot of you are thinking if you have a choice guys between aws on one side and firebase on the other choose firebase the reason is firebase is just a easier aws yeah that's how i put it okay it's easy simple aws it has pretty much all the functionality you'll ever need okay look firebase is being used by companies like instacart and twitch so it's not that it's for little people or just if you're making a small app you could build very powerful things with firebase but we like to go with it just because it's so much simpler and easier i've done both aws and firebase and i choose firebase all the time just because with aws there's a lot of admin headache you have to deal with there's a lot of dev op stuff that you have to learn about which you know as a developer you kind of just want to develop and move forward and we're going to talk about a lot of other things with firebase as well in just a second so for example it is scalable so if you want to have 100 million users or whatever your app will scale to match that yeah and um this is what is the real data realtime database that firebase has and then if you want to even add things like machine learning or whatever you can actually just add that with firebase i'm sure just like aws has those types of functionalities and the really powerful thing about firebase you guys is you can build full backends without even doing anything with node without even doing anything like that you can actually just do cloud functions and cloud yeah cloud functions allow did you know this by the way now i didn't even know this honestly oh really so yeah you could actually do full on everything like if you want to build a payment gateway with stripe sunny and i actually built it with uh firebase with outfit that's insane okay okay yeah so you guys can do everything with just react and firebase and literally have a scalable app to 100 million people and you know just handle everything like that firebase can also do storage for you so if your app has images firebase can optimize those images or media files for you and handle everything so this is why you know i really am a big advocate for it it's just like how aws has lambda firebase has cloud functions which is essentially the same functionality but just much easier to and you um user friendly nozzle you want to touch on this yeah no as a firebase is application it's like a really simply set up you know app to be able to authenticate or like log in you know you can log in i'm sorry i have to cut you off for a second your audio is cutting off maybe you can turn off your video and your audio would be better because your connection i think is dropping a little bit but i will i will speak to this point a little bit guys so authentication you can do all types of authentication like google facebook twitter github email or even phone all of these types of authentication you could do with firebase you guys and it's so easy it's all like few lines of code and one click of a button and boom you have google authentication built in as a matter of fact yesterday we built a clone for yo what did we build a clone on frankie yesterday what did we build look it up um slack so yesterday we built slack clone so realtime chat app using firebase and that clone that we built even had user authentication with a using firebase uh with google it had google user authentication so you guys can definitely use firebase for all of these types of things as well yeah thank you guys for reminding me everybody's yelling at me they're like slack hendricks is slack current is slack so thank you guys so much appreciate that all right so nas can you speak now let's try it so talk about this maybe cloud functions and let's see if your audio is working yeah so you know cloud function is basically it's you're able to create similar is very small functionalities and hopefully that you probably guys can hear me well now very small functionalities it's kind of like aws lambda functions except this is now with google and so you can create what kind of what kind of small applications can they create with that quasi you could create actually as big of applications as you want like crazy so i mean you can literally build a application like twitch using so this is guys this is getting into the world of server serverless um and when you get into serverless architecture i think this is where all modern development is actually going and if you guys want to be on the true bleeding edge and be one of the most highly paid and sought after people please start learning all serverless as of today as of now because your app can scale and you don't have to pay for anything that's not being used so if you have functions in your app that are not being run if you just host them on let's say heroku well you have to pay for every single function every single line of code that you have in your app now contrast that with using cloud functions unless a user actually activates that function uh maybe like let's say they charge their card and you have like a stripe function that runs to charge their card for the transaction that piece of code will not run until the user interacts with it it's almost like it's sleeping and then as soon as they use it boom now it runs and it gets activated and you get charged for it at that time so you can take a big company and instead of them spending 100 million dollars a year you can cut them down to maybe 50 million dollars a year just by moving to a serverless architecture and it's so much more scalable programming like this is a lot more fun a lot more bugfree and errorfree so really look into serverless architectures and again your app you can build as massive of an app or as small of an app as you can think of using cloud functions yeah yeah so let's move here now firebase also has all your storage okay so basically you can store everything all your media can be stored here and then it also can help you optimize your images and videos as well so i'm gonna move on to the next and it has your regular analytics that you expect to see in your app and it has all of those built in and much easier to use than aws you guys i built applications with aws and to this day i'm trying to figure out how to use the freaking cloud cloud log or whatever it's so freaking complicated dude it's very complicated man i still myself like have a hard time with this all i know is how to launch an ec2 instance that's pretty much it yeah and i don't know why they don't just make everything super super simple and basic but with this you guys it comes built in so as long as soon as you launch app you don't have to do anything it automatically adds all the google analytics from start of your app and all the react clones that we actually built have google analytics installed in them and it tracks them and then when it comes to testing this is the best set of testing suite that you could ever imagine it could literally test your app concurrently on like thousands of different types of devices for you and then it tells you the results of all of those tests and lets you know if there's any problems with it or if it's not responsive or whatever there may be and yeah so you can do a b testing with firebase cloud messaging inapp messaging and uh you know it's time for firebase to sponsor us so guys please reach out to them yeah fire come on let's go yep so somebody's saying yep people can one use firebase for production yes you can use firebase for production you guys this is why i'm saying like instacart right instacart uses firebase and twitch uses firebase and a lot of big companies use it and somebody said how much uh does firebase support sms whatsapp push notifications or or twofactor authentication so push notifications that's something else you have to look for something else for push notifications but firebase will be able there to to save the notifications there so um yeah and in fact twofactor application as well you can just set up factor auth with firebase because that is where you have google authentication you know facebook authentication and both of those support to factor off exactly now you guys i do want to mention one thing if you guys are interested in learning about all of these things like javascript and you are also interested in let me actually take you off nas just because i think it's gonna cut you off so you can quit your video actually if you want okay if you guys are interested in learning how to become a developer and go from zero to your first one hundred thousand dollars and whether you do that in six months twelve months or three years or five years i wanted we wanted to put together a full road map for you a stepbystep guide so what i recommend is definitely go ahead and check this video out we've put together a free exclusive training for you and it's called top three mistakes to avoid when becoming a javascript developer and it gives you a full roadmap how you can take your javascript or any coding skills and then turn that into cash so the link is actually in the description below and you guys can just go ahead click register at the bottom and register for this training and again it's a free training just super value packed so i did want to let you guys know of that hopefully that is valuable to you with that said let's continue so firebase guys it's free fast and easy to use alright so as easy as that now let's talk devops nas all right guys so what is devops now if you actually have an idea what it is drop that in the comments below but in general what devops is it is how my friends is how you go from developing an application to actually then putting it to live right think of it as like let's say you just developed facebook right and you want to put a lot for everybody to see and use right the whole process between development to putting it there is devops right and that includes things like for example right like building it right so if you right there right yeah section and then you go ahead and go to continuous integration and then go ahead and go to deployment and then you operate then you get feedback right and based on feedback you can then continues and continues and continues and if you go to the next slide and we're gonna touch base on all of these types of technologies as well so like you're gonna need to learn about things like docker or kubernetes or jira and you guys might have heard of selenium or jenkins all of this type of stuff right gate github gitlab all of these are things that you kind of have to know like git for example is a need every developer needs to know this so let's move on to the next one yeah for the this one what is continuous integration now right this is where you guys we talked about get right this is where your your version control of your application so think of it like that's where you store your code okay so that kind of it all kind of comes from there then your code gets uploaded to github okay from github what we can do is we can actually do unit testing now what is unit testing kazi unit testing is you basically take any part of your code and especially if you guys are doing functional programming you want to write tests for it and they should go and test if your application or your functions are behaving how you would expect it to behave so let's just say you made a simple form with user login where they could click enter their username password hit login and enter the site now you might have a test running using selenium or cypress data or whatever testing unit you want to use that testing thing will go and open a browser type in the correct username type in the correct password and hit log in if that works your test will pass if it doesn't log you in it will go your test has broken so then it will alert you send you a notification maybe on your mobile device a notification on your slack channel so the entire team knows that there's something wrong and then you know that you have a bug and then you can actually start fixing it so unit testing is really important because especially once your code base gets bigger and bigger what if you have i think it's easy to keep track of if you have 100 lines of code but what if your application you're working on has 10 000 lines of code or 1 million lines of code very hard to test it unless you have unit testing built in from day one and it's basically there guys so that to prevent any problems when it does go live okay from a unit testing you have code analysis so you can actually basically check hey how did this develop write the code wasn't clearly written or wasn't written and so you can you can get kind of there code and now then what you got you got test coverage so it appears first in a testing right and what happens here is that how much what percentage of my code is covered with testing with unit tests right is it fifty percent understanding is a seventy percent yeah and if if a certain test coverage passed right a lot for example other companies i was i'll just say really quickly a copy that i worked with we had to make sure that we had 70 test coverage right if that was passed then the last part what we did is we did a what we did a release okay that is when the application goes live and and so guys that whole circle that you see that is continuous integration a very big part of development and actually a lot of fun i'm not kidding i actually love it it's a lot of fun like especially if you get the hang of it test driven development they call it tdd yeah it's a lot of fun you guys once you actually learn how this thing works because oftentimes what i really like about test room and development is it can actually help you write code instead of be your enemy so the right way to do it if you want to do tests everybody has a different way but what you can do is you can actually write the test first i'll give you a very simple example let's say you wanted to make a sum function that just took a and b and combine them together so you could give this function 1 and 2 and you should get back a 3. now you could actually write a test case for it before you even start writing this function and that will tell you somebody like reading the test and let them know like okay the data types this should take is numbers it should take two arguments it should return what the result should look like of what it should return you can see at it in the test cases so then when you're actually writing the code it makes it very very clear for you uh on what it is you're trying to achieve with your code it makes you very thoughtful of it yeah all right let's keep going let's keep going with that all right so let's go so github introduced something called github actions and now it's now it's built in um with continuous integration now have you looked a lot into github actions what the little still i hear a lot of people like in the development blood people still aokay so yeah but it's pretty it's pretty clean guys how it like allows you to do lots of workflows in an automated way something to definitely look into anything any times you guys have new releases of things i think it's good to kind of jump on it even as a hobby play around with it because if it's something truly useful it can give you a big edge on other developers like one big thing you guys can do one big thing you guys can do is like for example let's say you just pushed your code right to github you can create a github action that will right away deploy to like right so that's just something that you can you know wanna you can use yup exactly now let's continue so let's talk dev stuff now there are lots of different things like design libraries so the big ones are material ui semantic and bootstrap these are the most popular libraries ever and they all actually support react and they have native react you know things that are built in so you can actually install bootstrap into your react app and then use it natively or you could install material ui natively and use it with your react app so let's continue now what is node and what is npm nas all right so guys right that node is the backend kind of the framework back in applications okay and npm actually goes hand in hand with node to install packages so let's say there's a maybe there is a reaction there's like a bootstrap you know uh package you want to install or maybe there's your ui package onto so npm is there to manage all your packages that you need to install and that's pretty much it honestly that's the difference the difference between those yup exactly and now a lot of people have a fight between npm or yarn guys just pick one they're both amazing and that's just honestly on npm and just pick npm you just just continue with it yeah that's it just pick npm and you're good to go now which code editor should i use adam i've used adam i've used sublime i've used visual studio code sublime [ __ ] sublime just because of how many times it asks me to pay for it um adam is really good but you know you know what i'm talking about right now is that yeah it's okay there we go yeah guys give some fire down in the comments for vs code yep so vs code then extensions are so easy but if i could just name one extension that puts it above everything is live yeah like just that one extension will clearly prove to you why vs code is superior to pretty much every other editor out there on the planet just that alone but there's tons of other i'll i love it for it's lightweight along with its being super extensible i can install vim with one click and i'm just up and running and so much more so vs code is the way to go and here are these extensions you must use these are like highly recommended so first of all i would highly recommend you guys get live share especially if you code with somebody another one i really like and use a lot is prettier so this is for every single time i hit save my code automatically gets formatted brackets because when i switched over to javascript it was so annoying how many squiggly brackets and semicolons you guys have in python it's all within indentation so it always confused me just to all the squigglies like which squiggly is closing which squiggly you know it was like give me a headache this solves that problem because every squiggly or every bracket gets every parentheses you have gets a color and then you can see oh the red one matches and closes the red one i'm good to go and the last one here that i want to talk about is uh so of course live server get this extension as well so then you can just have kind of hard reloading built in and then this one is the react one for es7 snippets and this allows you to do cool things where you can actually write in something like rfce hit tab and then boom it just like writes a full component for you in react so that's insane yeah super nice so those are the so the in when it comes to linters and formatters you need is you know prettier we talked about it and then eslint and then seven snippets and we've talked about this live code sharing or pair programming super useful for that and now you might be asking how do i learn so how do you learn nas and what are we seeing here yeah guys so the first thing the first and easiest way to learn is obviously going to be through youtube just as you are doing it here guys you are learning through a youtube platform that's number one and second way is going to be through what let's keep going on the next slide that is going to be through community yeah a very important i always say that community is probably one of the most important things that developer can have so right so for example join a slack community of developers join a discorded community of developers a facebook community linkedin community internet community any of those communities you're going to connect make friends and also learn a lot but hold on hold on give it a second give it a second you will have the opportunity to potentially even get a job as well that is the biggest one okay and then with those communities in mind the third community is going to be what let's keep going the next one amazing community all right take it our community is lit as [ __ ] let me actually show you guys let me show you um actually a nice transition into our community nice slides whoever did them i think sunny huh so guys look at this community it's always just lit like sonya deep just shared his experience and he goes an elearning company here in my country paid me paid him to take youtube sessions to learn coding that is sick so boom there is go ahead and somewhat deep actually you guys don't don't know here but somehow deep actually got a job at expedia whoa are you serious yep yeah we get a job at expedia as a developer i think two months two months after joining javascript after joining profile javascript bro oh that makes me so happy bro i know right guys i gotta get on a call with this guy guys give somebody give somebody but like a like or give somebody a high five in the comments below because he's killing it let's party for something deep you guys i know we don't have nas here but i'll do the dancing for him hey hey let's go let's go wait wait wait oh [ __ ] nas is here wait okay we can see you in the middle nice so guys samia deep this is awesome guys the community is just really really great so you guys can see whether you're posting technical questions we are responding to you and helping you out or you guys can be posting and sharing your wins the coaching calls homework assignments guys at the end of the day look it doesn't matter i'm just going to get real with you here doesn't matter whether you join the profit of a javascript community or any other community what's important is that you become a part of a community you become a part of a family essentially if you think about dancers how they get good at it is they join a dancing community people who become really people who become really good at anything are parts of like community they're around those people who have the skill that you want to have or did they want to have and so that's the key thing here for you guys that's the thing that is important and kazi how can they join the community like this by the way oh if you guys want to join our profit with javascript community it's very simple you guys you can go to this page over here here is the link at the top the link is going to be also in the description but it's our course called profit with javascript and really the biggest thing about this course if i can just give you one thing is that we actually you know of course we give you the technical training and the live calls which are huge but we actually help you make an income with it that's our number one goal we want you to have your skills on this side meet practicality and ability to make an income that's profit with javascript in a nutshell so if you're even slightly curious go ahead and check this page out and watch this video it's lit and with that said let's just jump back into the training dope dope dope now what is tutorial hell now people talk about this often do you know about this i don't know about this i've been there guys if you let us know in the comments but basically it's just you want to become a developer right you're learning a lot of new things and at the same time what's going on is you're just watching a lot of youtube tutorials one stop one after the other one after the other and so you definitely definitely want to get away from that right build watch the target at the same time build a project joining another community so i think nas is slightly wrong on this one i think what this actually is is once a developer passes away and they were a bad developer that's where they go to go to tutorial hell now guys you want to master the fundamentals all right make sure you master them and don't move past until you master them and this is everybody's nightmare i think this is actually what happens when you die as a developer and you were a bad developer you know this is what your eternity just loops over again and again and again so things like this make sure you understand them like what is a git merge and how to deal with it i i i think that if you i honestly think that if somebody's an expert at git merge they can just get a job just for knowing how to get merged as an expert yeah definitely good like i feel like it's that important or get pushed you know push or get pulled you know exactly and here we got we got some other stuff uh steve says no they become a project manager that's hilarious the hell did i go to now why you need to know get and hit up github you guys get is how i think of it is a time machine also in a video game you have saves and checkpoints when your character dies wouldn't it suck that after you spent 10 hours into a game you would have to start from zero that would suck that's why developers invented uh savings and checkpoint so when you your character dies in a video game you can start from the last checkpoint when it comes to get in your software if you don't do that you're not really saving along the way so if your code breaks at some point application breaks you can never go back to when things were working and you're permanently screwed and the company can lose millions of dollars but if you understand how git works essentially just like a time machine so you can actually go back in time to when things were working just fine and you can also be working with other developers at the same time working on three different features so developer one can be working on the ability to add user login developer two can be adding the functionality for the app to be hosted online or or something right and then at some point they can actually merge both of those things at the same time and now both of those functionalities are added simultaneously into the app so git is an extremely important thing to learn and one important note i want to make is get is i repeat not git is not github yeah well wait so what is the difference i thought it was github so the difference between git and github you guys is github is literally think of it like dropbox for code think of it like google drive for code you just save your code on github that is it get is what is version control so if you get in an interview and you don't know the difference i will come and fire you yeah good luck good luck i online version forget that's pretty much it yup exactly now what is a pre processor you guys so preprocessors are things that allows you to process your css so there are things like sas and they gave you some additional functionality post css and less what was cool what's cool about them is they can allow you to do really like fancy things in a fast way and they also give you ability to add in variables to your css but a lot of that functionality now is coming natively where now you can actually just add variables in your css so nas do you know what the point of using a preprocessor for you would be yeah so for sas we actually initially enough we actually went over with this in a recent coaching call but the reason why you you would use for example like sas or last or post css guys is because think of it as like it's like i see it as like css on steroids and it is what makes css scalable meaning you can write huge application with css right for example for example one one big thing you got to consider is like bootstrap or material ui how do you think they are written they are written with sas right because there you can have variables you can have mixins we call it right you can have it's like basically having javascript functionality inside css oh that's actually a great way to put it so javascript basically javascript in css almost yeah functionality in css nice okay hopefully that makes it really clear for you guys i think that's a great explanation for using these types of things like sass or less yep beautiful yeah all right let's move forward now style components nas what are these so style components that is what we have in react right and basically what you would do is you would create components and you would actually style the components within javascript right so when you build react applications um you don't necessarily build you sometimes you build sometimes you do have css within css files but sometimes you can also have css within the javascript file too that's something you should guys look into like if you're gonna learn react you're gonna learn style components yep and react uses something called jsx which allows you to be able to do all those things in javascript as well exactly dope and then we also and what are css modules uh the css modules that is basically you can create i i like to call them partials right so you can so for example if you have sas that that you know if using sas you can create kind of think of it as like you know a module for variables in css you can create a module for you know a specific you know let's say let's say it's you know the header right yeah and then you can create the main module we call let's say you call it the main module and then main module what does it do it imports all of the other partial modules okay so the header module the variable modules right it's almost like component based like how to react yeah it's like component based css almost yeah but yeah you basically split it up and that's it yeah so think of it like uh how components are to react right css modules are to css so kind of like that you guys could use them exactly dope and then we have bam have you ever used spam and ons and do you know what a good reason to use bam is so guys i actually have never learned about bam until somebody came along yes talks about it all the time sunny is a very big proponent of that yeah so yeah cause actually you go ahead and talk about it because i know i know you you've had dealt more with it at this point with yeah i use it a lot more i use it with sunny a bunch and bam guys it's a really clean way for having naming conventions it will also allow you to do things in a way where they're like you won't have conflicts as your app starts to scale it will have co naming conventions that are very very sensible and the name itself most of the times will make it extremely clear what it's doing so it's going to be really good for debugging it's going to be really good for other developers to be able to read your code they will instantly understand what all of your css designs and what all of your classes are meant to do so definitely learn bam it's going to help you out tremendously yeah and what's pwa by the way guys we are almost at a thousand likes guys let's get that to a thousand i think we're 800 right now come on let's go we're at 954 yes yo guys we're at 954. if you guys if you guys could help us break that thousand like mark that would be huge thank you guys so much and we're currently at six six six people live the devil's number what is happening wow oh i think maybe we were talking about tutorial hell and we started detracting like a javascript satan oh man we got to be careful now now what is this pwa stuff yeah so that's progressive we call this guys progressive web applications okay and the and we i like to call them as one page apps right so if you think about it actually actually for example facebook is a progressive web app netflix is a progressive web app youtube is a progressive web app yeah why is it a progressive web is because it's actually one page but when you go to different like for example it's actually one think of it as one html page right but yeah but as you go to different pages certain blocks change yeah so guys did you notice for example that when you go for example on youtube did you notice that you when you go to for example video the header pretty much stays the same right the header at the top is the same yeah that is what makes it a progressive web app yep because it's one page and only certain components change as you kind of go to a different you know a different page on this site itself right yeah and yeah and it's very popular nowadays it is basically when you're going to learn how to become a fullstack developer you're going to be learning progressive applications super powerful and i think let me see actually so features of pewa it allows you to make full responsive and ads in browser compatibility it has connectivity independence so your app can actually work offline as well it has a app like interface can you can add it to your home screen it has push notifications which for some reason are only for android right now so i think apple needs to step up their game and then it allows you to make it fast using service workers now let's go on to type checkers and this is always a big battle between things like typescript and flow so typescript is essentially just think of it like a supercharged uh javascript yep okay because what typescript is you guys is if i was to draw it out right if we have this here and then i'm gonna make another circle inside of it yeah now the smaller circle inside of it is javascript the bigger circle is typescript so technically speaking typescript is actually is a superset of javascript so by definition oh crap my thing is blocking so now you guys should be able to see it so by definition it's actually javascript and then some and what it allows you to do is add in a lot of type checking that you know a lot of people really like languages like java it's strongly typed you can see what data types are going to be returned with every function it is a lot less buggy when you write your code and people love that functionality so they thought about how could they actually bring that to javascript so then it's less buggy more scalable and they introduced typescript yeah yeah so for big companies actually it's actually it's very popular so you know when you're thinking about tesla are you thinking about all these companies who are using react they're going to be using typescript yep omkar says now we see our path is slowly lighting up thank you so much for this session yep now let's go yeah you guys can learn typescript and you guys so felipe asks should i learn start learning typescript instead of javascript now remember it's up it is built on top of javascript so there's no way you can detach the two they're both the same typescript is just more but i would say but i would say my recommendation to to felipe because that's another question first right javascript first hundred percent typescript could come later don't worry about that just yet yeah yeah just get really good with javascript you guys and then move on to it and you guys can use it now so this is the fight that's happening between typescript and flow and we know who the winner is you guys another word for typescript you guys know another word another way of saying typescript it's actually hype script oh isn't it um damn man where's my sound stuff go i wanted to play the freaking air horns who stole my sounds all right i'm gonna play it right now all right there we go so yeah so typescript is super popular and the trend is just going like stupid which is why a lot of people are actually calling it hype script so i would i would just if i had to pick between the two i would just pick typescript and call it a day okay yeah yeah i'd agree with that let's move on now people talk about dino what's the hype about knowledge do you know about this you want to speak to it you want me to talk about it i don't know too much about dino guys okay cool so there is npm right there's npm and npm was pretty awesome but then the creator of npm was like hey man i found a lot of weird things about npm and i want to like take it to the next level and then he ended up creating dino but until it takes off and it starts being super popular and big companies start using it guys keep learning npm because npm is not going to be going anywhere anytime soon as a hobby and for fun you can start picking up dino just for you know you want to do something cutting edge new shiny object but keep learning npm guys keep learning npm and just keep stick to npm for now now webpacks you want to speak to this yeah so webpack guys is you know it's basically think of it as like it's a task manager for javascript so you know how you saw a lot of those like preprocessors so webpack is what allows you for example to use sas it allows you to for example magnify javascript so when i say modify i mean like compress javascript okay and this is what allows you to build you know progressive applications or single page applications okay and the reason why that is is because it's like a layer above your application okay so it runs the server right it runs any tasks that are needed in terms of like processing your css processing your javascript processing your html all that stuff webpack does and you know it's definitely one i would say i would say one of the biggest like developer tools that's used in you know in big in applications hundred percent yeah nice okay so definitely so when it comes to learning this should we say definitely learn this hundred percent web so in the case there's a few there's webpack there's golf and then there's grunt webpack is the biggest one highly recommend you i would say focus on that one so focus on webpack yes okay got it awesome so focus on webpack and then you guys can learn about other ones too but webpack is the most popular yep beautiful and then dev tools nas what is this do i need to know chrome i mean why can't i become a developer without knowing devtools bro what are you talking about oh man man chrome chrome chrome guys if you don't know chrome dev tools i don't know man um let's just say that you have to understand how to use chrome debugger how to use you know chrome console and just being able to use um chrome as a way to debug your website okay just take your lives at that you know so you just need it for debugging yeah super powerful and guys i'm just going to give you one little hack anyway so learn console.log which is very important and here's another one console.table use this one guys it's just like this is like a little pro tip i'll throw in there yeah amazing for visualizing your objects and arrays as a table and it's just such a nice little trick you guys can use yeah and console the log everything also the log your life yep yeah all right react so using the react profiler have you used this now do you know what this is i have not used react profile now okay guys so use react profiler and now native apps and react native guys if you do if you want to build native apps it's really easy to do it to react as pretty much all the apps that you build with react are almost native and ready to go and be translated into a mobile app anyway yeah i think i said react actually tesla app is built with react native oh really tesla is yep yep okay damn let me put that tesla build damn nice okay cool so let's move forward now electron is for desktop apps and uh here are some of the things that are built with electron.js okay so electron is it allows you to build desktop apps with javascript okay build holy i'm looking at right now right now so vs code vs code which slack what slack you didn't know that what no way yeah all of this stuff i was actually just gonna like write all of these out that they're all actually built with this wow insane yep and um steve is saying something awesome he's like about 75 only about 75 is usable from react to react native so if you want to make something completely native that's something you guys should learn which is react native itself and um oh i know what the profiler is guys i'm sorry i don't know why i acted like an idiot where so the react profiler it is a chrome extension you guys can get and you can go to pretty much any app and use it in your chrome uh where you guys have your chrome console and inspector tools you can actually have a react profiler and it allows you to see how that app is built you can see all the components and everything along those lines okay so i see yeah so electron js is pretty damn sick to to learn i think you guys should definitely take a look into it if something along those lines interests you to make desktop apps now we're going to get into testing frameworks so now let's go for it yeah so obviously there's there's three three types of testing we have number one unit testing number two integration testing and then three functional testing so jest is definitely what is one of the testing frameworks that you can use for example for example with like react okay and then if you if we keep going on uh enzyme right you know you can looks like airbnb actually uses jest as well to test to test their code because their application is written in they're even using it to test their ui yeah yeah yeah yeah so some very a very powerful powerful tool there yep so support for hooks and the one you guys should use which is actually like super highly recommended and one of the best is this one cypress so if you guys want to use this is actually even better than selenium you guys so if you want to use something use cyprus.io for testing gotcha and allows you to test anything that runs in a browser and then of course you have selenium and there's also selenium for react so you guys can use selenium to test react apps and then there is something called server side rendering so a lot of the times if you guys want to go from a you know if you guys want to get to that senior level developer server side rendering is one of those things you guys should actually really learn about and understand and one of the tools you can use for it is called next.js so this is i was going to say vishnu vishnu has just donated 40 i'm not sure what what how much money that is 40 something did you see that yep thank you so much vishnu for the donation really appreciate you and let me see i'll take you guys to next.js actually and let's actually take a look at that website so boom here we go oh it's by versal nice okay so this is what it is it's a react framework for prerender sites and it's the jam stack for the enterprise so you guys can see it has file system routing so i can actually like switch between app really really fast and it will do all of the rendering and everything server side so then when the user goes it's extremely fast the reason to learn it is to make your apps really really fast at a very high level in an english version of server side rendering is it's like a cr it basically allows you to make super lightning fast apps okay and think about it think of it as like you have a cached version of your app like your whole html app yes it's the cached version and you're right away displaying to the user as the as they are loading it exactly it also has next.js also has automatic cloud code splitting so if your app is online and there's bunch of stuff that's not being used or a bunch of files that the user is not using it will upload them without uploading those things so that way it's going to be super lightweight as it gets uploaded it'll know like whatever is not being used it just won't upload that for those parts so that's super powerful will save you a ton of space and make your app really really fast so why use it it's good for static exporting prerendering it requires pretty much no configuration on your end it's fully extensible allows you to do css in javascript it is ready for production and here are the companies that are using it next.js so trulia netflix github twitch docker starbucks hulu and the list goes on so definitely something you guys should look into and then here i think that you can even go to their showcase and uh they show you like what are all the so here's like jobs.netflix.com page is built with next.js yeah so you can see and you can see basically just how fast it loads all the data right away yeah right again because it is a static pretty much site let's see what type of jobs uh netflix have because i'm about to get a job there bro i'm about to leave clever programmer let's apply yeah let's apply forget about these live streams yeah uh i mean over bye guys yeah guys sorry i'm gonna apply here all right so let's go back do you guys want some music in these live streams guys what are you guys thinking because i'm thinking we should start adding some music to this thing and make it a lot more like upbeat maybe some dubstep in the back savage i'm just gonna be i'm just gonna be dancing all the time man yeah i want to add music to this stuff bro he goes you guys are doing great really looking forward to learn and enhance my technical skills from you guys thank you so much appreciate you all right somebody asks how to choose between client side and server side you there's you're going to have to learn both if you want to build full stack applications yeah and some there's a client side first and then learn server side trust me yeah run learn yeah exactly that's a good order to do it in do you want to speak to static side generators nas yeah so static slide generators is it's kind of kind of what you guys saw with next js but imagine you kind of have imagine you have a website right that shows some data right um well what what happens is that excite generator will actually take the data from a database create a static html site and then we'll be able to display to a user okay yeah and again the reason why we do this is because of speed okay so instead of us trying to go every time a user tries to get some you know a site instead of us trying to go to the database grabbing grabbing data from a database and then you know show the html the html is right there displayed for them and so that my friends is why kind of like you use aesthetic side generators yep exactly now there are the most popular static side generator right now is gatsby very very powerful i think helpful to learn that this is for server side so this is next.js there's jekyll next is i believe it's basically like next js but for vue you got hugo gatsby so one thing i'll recommend is if you want to do static site use gatsby if you want uh speed in a dynamic app that you're building and you want more scalability pick next js so i think between these these are the two i would recommend for you guys yeah and it gatsby actually works very nicely with react as well so that's true yep so there you go and uh if you guys are still not sure how to get started uh let's all we can talk about how to make money as a developer so this in we covered this in a lot of detail in the last live stream we're not going to go too much into detail on this but one of the ways you guys can actually make an income is by teaching coding to people and i'm going to just list out some platforms that are good for this if you guys are interested you can pause it and view this but i already covered a lot of this in front of developer guide so i'll just talk about like some resources you guys can go is facebook groups instagram wise and take lessons people per hour craigslist upwork fiverr or linkedin or some other ones you guys can take a screenshot of this but these are really good resources for going and getting jobs as a developer even if you're a beginner and you don't have actual job because getting a fulltime job guys will take you a long time will take you you know most for most people it takes them one to two years so in the start i think what i recommend is you learn coding and then you can teach it to other people and charge them whether they're high school students college students boo they're going to coding boot camp you can definitely help them and just with these two platforms alone wise and and take lessons i personally before i started clever programmer was able to scale my income to 104 000 per year and then i added in craigslist and this is where i started actually i used craigslist to freelance and i started adding and with craigslist i was able to take my income even above that so i i would use it to land contracts or freelancing clients so that gave me another source of income and those are the ones i really really recommend for you guys as well if you guys want to go more on the freelancing side then you can go heavier on upwork nice number two way of making an income from coding is how nas freelancing guys so that means basically you are a person and you are getting work by yourself from clients right so you're going up you're using websites like upwork like freelancer.com like toptail and you're literally just kind of going there seeing what work needs to be done and then applying and then saying hey guys hey hey client i can actually do this work and this is how much i charge and that's pretty much it so it's very it's very much different from because it's just like basically it's project by project basis yep exactly and then of course you guys can go the route which is step three for a lot of people is getting a permanent job or you know even if it's not permanent getting a fulltime job essentially and so that's really like level three like if i had to put it i think you could teach people as a beginner um number two you can freelance as kind of intermediate developer and then i think for full time you need to be a little bit more advanced because nobody's going to like want to pay you a lot of money if you're either not advanced or not you know have some experience so freelancing and teaching how allows you to get that experience i'm going to also go through this pretty fast but i think that you should go in this order learn coding then learn to coach and that should put you at 3k per month income learn the freelance that should put you at 5k a month income so this stacks on top of each other so this 3k and 5k you should be at 8k a month and um and again guys it's very rare for people but if you actually follow this roadmap and put in the work it's very possible for you and then if you have a job you can be making 7k a month from a job but at which point you could choose to keep all three sources of income or say no to all your clients say no to all this and just be happy with the 7k a month or you could keep your freelancing plus this and now you have 13k a month coming in or you could choose to say no to your freelancing keep some clients on the side they're teaching coding to and this and now that puts you at 10k really like whatever flavor suits you but the potential if you put in ridiculous hours of work and time that your potential income could really be 15k a month or more so with that said you guys if you guys want to be able to actually learn and go ahead you can take a picture of this and i added in a nice little camera for you guys here you can take a picture of that if you guys want to learn how to do all of this we have packaged this in our course called profit with javascript the link is in the description below so definitely go and at the very least just click the button to check out that program uh oh and we
