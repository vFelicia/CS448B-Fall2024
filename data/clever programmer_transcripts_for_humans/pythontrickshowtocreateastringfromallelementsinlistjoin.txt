00:00 - hey you welcome back to the Python hacks
00:05 - and tips and tricks and tips series in
00:08 - this video we will work on using the
00:13 - join method so without any further ado
00:15 - let's jump right into it
00:17 - alright so join method is super cool it
00:20 - allows us to put together a list of
00:23 - strings or a string of Lists basically
00:28 - it allows us to take a list okay and we
00:30 - can turn it into a string in the fastest
00:32 - way possible that's just one use case
00:34 - scenario so here's what we're gonna be
00:36 - doing for example say we have this
00:39 - sentence here and this sentence says
00:42 - something like python has officially
00:44 - been searched on google more times than
00:46 - Kim Kardashian and we'll finish it off
00:49 - by saying in 2018 oops let's put this
00:56 - period right over here alright so this
00:59 - is a true sentence actually and what
01:04 - we're gonna do is we want to put this
01:05 - together into one string as you can see
01:08 - right now it's a list okay so what would
01:11 - be one way to do it
01:13 - what I want you to do is pause the video
01:15 - right this second and go and see if you
01:17 - can write a solution for this in under
01:20 - 30 seconds I'm gonna give you five
01:22 - seconds five four three two one
01:26 - alright so one solution for this would
01:28 - be something like this okay and a lot of
01:31 - people would do this you'll create an
01:32 - empty string then you'll say for word in
01:35 - the sentence you will basically do plus
01:40 - equals and you'll say something like
01:42 - this and maybe a little thing like this
01:46 - and then at the end do print final write
01:51 - and then it will say python has
01:53 - officially been searched on Google more
01:55 - times than Kim Kardashian in 2018 okay
01:58 - that's cool you know Python is cool if
02:01 - it beeped Kim K so take that Kim K but
02:07 - there's gonna be a much easier solution
02:09 - my friend and this is the solution that
02:11 - I prefer
02:13 - and it's but the join method okay so
02:16 - what we can essentially do is we can
02:18 - just do this alright we can say dot join
02:20 - and sentence and then you can just print
02:24 - out final alright and it prints out
02:29 - essentially the same thing so this is my
02:33 - go-to solution if you want to play with
02:36 - this file that I'm playing with right
02:38 - now and just get access to my code just
02:40 - go in the description of this video on
02:44 - YouTube and I have provided the links to
02:47 - the notes that was the tip and the trick
02:50 - hack for today if you would like to see
02:55 - a trick in the upcoming videos then make
02:59 - sure to post a comment on what you would
03:00 - like to see next and I'll make sure that
03:02 - whatever is voted up or makes a lot of
03:05 - sense I make a video on that okay thank
03:08 - you so much for watching that's it for
03:09 - this video and as always my friend I'll
03:11 - see you in the next video

hey you welcome back to the Python hacks and tips and tricks and tips series in this video we will work on using the join method so without any further ado let's jump right into it alright so join method is super cool it allows us to put together a list of strings or a string of Lists basically it allows us to take a list okay and we can turn it into a string in the fastest way possible that's just one use case scenario so here's what we're gonna be doing for example say we have this sentence here and this sentence says something like python has officially been searched on google more times than Kim Kardashian and we'll finish it off by saying in 2018 oops let's put this period right over here alright so this is a true sentence actually and what we're gonna do is we want to put this together into one string as you can see right now it's a list okay so what would be one way to do it what I want you to do is pause the video right this second and go and see if you can write a solution for this in under 30 seconds I'm gonna give you five seconds five four three two one alright so one solution for this would be something like this okay and a lot of people would do this you'll create an empty string then you'll say for word in the sentence you will basically do plus equals and you'll say something like this and maybe a little thing like this and then at the end do print final write and then it will say python has officially been searched on Google more times than Kim Kardashian in 2018 okay that's cool you know Python is cool if it beeped Kim K so take that Kim K but there's gonna be a much easier solution my friend and this is the solution that I prefer and it's but the join method okay so what we can essentially do is we can just do this alright we can say dot join and sentence and then you can just print out final alright and it prints out essentially the same thing so this is my goto solution if you want to play with this file that I'm playing with right now and just get access to my code just go in the description of this video on YouTube and I have provided the links to the notes that was the tip and the trick hack for today if you would like to see a trick in the upcoming videos then make sure to post a comment on what you would like to see next and I'll make sure that whatever is voted up or makes a lot of sense I make a video on that okay thank you so much for watching that's it for this video and as always my friend I'll see you in the next video
