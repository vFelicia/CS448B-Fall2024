00:00 - let me tell you about the most pivotal
00:02 - moment
00:03 - in my software career i can attribute
00:05 - this exact moment to being the reason
00:07 - why
00:07 - i was able to crush my interview with
00:09 - google microsoft and blue origin
00:11 - i couldn't even believe that these
00:13 - things were achievable like getting a
00:15 - job at google
00:16 - i can't do that but after this moment
00:19 - i was able to get the confidence and the
00:21 - skills that i needed to completely shine
00:23 - on those interviews and this is the
00:25 - origin of data structures poppy
00:28 - so how did it start for me well i
00:30 - clearly remember one day at my
00:32 - university
00:32 - three google software engineers came to
00:35 - visit sort of for like a recruiting
00:36 - event and everyone was all hyped about
00:38 - it all my classmates were like man i'm
00:40 - gonna network with that person i'm gonna
00:41 - go become that person's best friend get
00:42 - the job i was just like whoa like a
00:44 - google software developer it was like a
00:46 - pokemon or something just something i
00:48 - wasn't ever going to see in my entire
00:50 - life so when they came
00:51 - they told us about what it is and what
00:53 - it takes to get a job there but in the
00:54 - back of my head i was still always
00:56 - thinking
00:57 - man that's just not me i'm never gonna
00:59 - be able to get those opportunities
01:01 - i specifically remember thinking that
01:02 - thought when there's the part where
01:03 - they're doing
01:04 - a mock interview two of the googlers
01:07 - went up to the white board and then
01:08 - one of them asked a question write me a
01:11 - function that can find me the path
01:13 - from a to b and literally my mouth just
01:16 - dropped
01:17 - because i couldn't even comprehend on
01:19 - where to begin
01:20 - this is where i was like i'm never gonna
01:22 - become a googler and it was so crazy
01:24 - because it was like a magic show
01:26 - literally
01:27 - the other developer just started to go
01:29 - through the problem
01:30 - break it down into the different pieces
01:32 - solve each part write this amazing
01:34 - function this algorithm
01:38 - using the right data structures to find
01:40 - the shortest path
01:41 - and for me this was a magic show this
01:43 - was like when you're a little kid
01:45 - and you see the magician pull the bunny
01:46 - out of the hat and you're just
01:47 - absolutely amazed
01:49 - so after that i was determined to have a
01:51 - conversation
01:52 - with that software developer i was
01:54 - determined to go up to him and ask him
01:55 - like
01:56 - how can i get this so that's exactly
01:57 - what i did i was super scared i was
01:58 - super nervous
01:59 - walking up to the guy i remember my
02:01 - hands were shaky palms were a little bit
02:02 - sweaty
02:03 - mom's spaghetti and then all of a sudden
02:05 - i go up to him and then i kind of just
02:07 - ask him hey man like honestly i i've
02:10 - never seen myself
02:11 - being able to work at google just
02:13 - because it's been like a dream
02:14 - for you like how were you able to do it
02:17 - and then he kind of started to tell me
02:18 - his story he was telling me how he was a
02:20 - developer he started working at a
02:22 - company in fact he graduated from the
02:23 - same university that i did and that gave
02:25 - me hope
02:25 - and he started working at some company
02:27 - moved to another one three years later
02:28 - and finally google recruiter reached out
02:29 - to him he had three weeks to prep for
02:31 - the interview
02:32 - and what he did for those three weeks
02:33 - was he went hard into the basics of
02:35 - programming the data structure and
02:37 - algorithms literally he told me his
02:38 - schedule
02:39 - was he would work nine to five after
02:41 - five from
02:42 - five to eight pm monday through friday
02:44 - he would do white boarding problems just
02:46 - solving problem after problem after
02:48 - problem then on the weekend
02:50 - he would do six to eight hours each day
02:52 - both saturday and sunday
02:53 - or more problem solving and when he told
02:56 - me that
02:57 - when he told me that that is when
02:59 - everything changed for me because that
03:01 - is when i realized
03:02 - if this amazing developer in front of me
03:04 - was able to get there
03:06 - you know starting from the similar
03:07 - position where i'm at from the same
03:08 - university it's not like a huge
03:10 - university it's not a prestigious
03:11 - university in fact it's a university
03:13 - that has a 100 acceptance rate
03:15 - what like no one gets rejected going
03:17 - into the university that i went to right
03:19 - he was able to go there and end up at
03:20 - google and not only that when i realized
03:23 - that data structures and algorithms
03:24 - was simply just a skill that's when
03:27 - everything changed for me this is that
03:28 - pivotal moment because i realized
03:30 - the skill i realized i can learn that
03:33 - skill
03:33 - i realize i can build that confidence
03:36 - because confidence comes from one thing
03:37 - and one thing only
03:38 - how well do you know something when you
03:41 - know something
03:42 - to a high level every detail you're
03:44 - going to be super confident
03:46 - when you perform that task and that's
03:48 - what i realized
03:49 - i just had to do more repetition so from
03:52 - that day forward
03:53 - every single day for 30 minutes a day i
03:55 - solved
03:56 - one algorithm problem and i did it again
03:58 - and again and again and again i'm not
04:00 - gonna lie i miss some days but i just
04:01 - did it over and over and over again
04:04 - and that allowed me to start to build so
04:06 - much competence that i could distinguish
04:08 - what are the different things that i
04:10 - have to do to solve these different
04:11 - problems i was able to show up with the
04:13 - confidence
04:14 - i was able to crush those interviews and
04:16 - i was able to get
04:18 - the job offers and the rest is history
04:20 - that's how data structures papi was born
04:24 - of course i'm not a guru guys i'm just a
04:27 - regular person
04:28 - i just developed the right skill set so
04:30 - what i want to get to right now is i
04:31 - want to make the magic show
04:33 - i'm going to solve the exact same
04:35 - problem that that google developer
04:37 - solved in front of me
04:38 - that got me inspired to take action
04:40 - because i want to inspire
04:42 - you to be able to go out there and build
04:44 - the skill set that you need so let's go
04:46 - ahead
04:46 - and jump into that problem guys and here
04:49 - we are
04:50 - finding the shortest path from the top
04:52 - left to the bottom right
04:54 - of this array i'm not gonna lie this is
04:55 - probably not the exact same problem
04:57 - that they did but let's go ahead and
04:59 - dive into this let's go ahead and solve
05:00 - this problem so what i always want to
05:02 - start off doing is kind of replicating
05:04 - the problem here i get on my whiteboard
05:05 - i'm gonna replicate the same array that
05:07 - they have in the lead code example
05:09 - so i have a great starting point now
05:11 - what i start to notice is there's going
05:12 - to be a specific pattern here it's going
05:14 - to get me the shortest path since i'm
05:16 - going from the top
05:17 - left all the way to the bottom right i
05:18 - can only go to the right or down
05:21 - from each square to the next square
05:23 - knowing this well i could create another
05:25 - array that at
05:26 - every specific position that's going to
05:28 - represent the minimum
05:29 - sum needed to get to that point here the
05:31 - first value in the top left
05:33 - will just be the same from the original
05:34 - array the first row and the first column
05:37 - will also be unique
05:38 - because we can only travel in one
05:39 - direction we would just get the value
05:41 - at that same position adding the sum of
05:43 - the previous positions so that gets us
05:45 - the minimum path because there's only
05:47 - one path however when we start to look
05:49 - at the other positions you could take
05:51 - two different paths one coming from the
05:52 - top
05:53 - and one coming from the left so on those
05:55 - we're then compared to see which one has
05:57 - the minimum number by adding the current
05:59 - position and the previous path
06:01 - so let me go ahead and code it up now
06:03 - cool so now when we actually start to
06:04 - code the first thing i like to do is
06:06 - write my pseudo code i just write it on
06:07 - comments because these are the steps i'm
06:09 - gonna have to take now these are the
06:10 - specific steps that i just talked you
06:12 - through of having the minimum path so i
06:14 - start with the very first implementation
06:15 - this is just creating my array of zeros
06:17 - simple double for loop next thing is
06:19 - setting the initial zero zero
06:21 - as well as now getting all of the first
06:24 - column and all of the first rows now by
06:26 - the way there's actually a bug here that
06:27 - i was stuck on for a bit
06:28 - let's see if you could figure it out
06:29 - before we get to the bug reveal but
06:31 - again this is just two simple loops to
06:33 - fill
06:34 - out the summation of my first row and
06:36 - the summation of my first column because
06:38 - those are the ones that i don't have to
06:39 - do different combinations so from there
06:41 - we go over to actually getting the
06:43 - summations of all of the different
06:45 - positions
06:46 - inside of my summations array all i have
06:47 - to do is i have to add the current value
06:50 - of the specific
06:50 - ij position on the grid and then just
06:53 - get the minimum
06:54 - of either one position to the left or
06:57 - one position to the top
06:59 - because that minimum is going to give me
07:00 - the shortest path there
07:02 - and boom here's the celebration that you
07:04 - always have to have
07:05 - whenever you think you figured it out
07:10 - it was at this moment that he knew he
07:12 -  up
07:14 - it did take me a while to figure this
07:16 - one out my code only worked for
07:17 - square studio race not for rectangular
07:19 - 2d array because
07:21 - if you look at my first loop the
07:22 - conditional statement was wrong
07:24 - let's go so that is how that is done
07:28 - that is magic
07:29 - i hope that you saw how the magic works
07:30 - i hope that this kind of inspired you
07:32 - to really dive into data structures
07:34 - algorithms because that's what we did
07:36 - here right we were able to kind of get
07:38 - this problem
07:39 - that we had and they were able to draw
07:40 - it out kind of come to a solution
07:42 - and finally we were able to implement it
07:44 - so guys this is why data structure's not
07:46 - going to be so important
07:47 - you could just do this you could get
07:48 - better every single
07:50 - time i am not a guru i'm just a regular
07:53 - person
07:54 - i just worked on enough of these that i
07:55 - was able to kind of figure out
07:57 - what it was that i needed to do next you
07:59 - can get to this point in fact you could
08:01 - probably get even better results
08:03 - than i did you just have to practice and
08:05 - it's going to take
08:06 - time to get there it's going to take
08:08 - patience but we are here
08:10 - for you so with that being said i hope
08:12 - you got value
08:13 - from this video if you did go ahead hit
08:15 - that like button
08:16 - comment below let me know what you guys
08:18 - want to see more with data structures
08:19 - and
08:19 - algorithms because i want to give you
08:21 - guys more value to help you crush it to
08:23 - help you
08:25 - on your next interview so you could get
08:26 - that job offer so you could have that
08:28 - confidence
08:29 - not be like how i was before but
08:31 - actually being able to move towards
08:32 - having the goals that you want all right
08:34 - guys that is it for coach daniel
08:36 - i will see you in the next one peace

Cleaned transcript:

let me tell you about the most pivotal moment in my software career i can attribute this exact moment to being the reason why i was able to crush my interview with google microsoft and blue origin i couldn't even believe that these things were achievable like getting a job at google i can't do that but after this moment i was able to get the confidence and the skills that i needed to completely shine on those interviews and this is the origin of data structures poppy so how did it start for me well i clearly remember one day at my university three google software engineers came to visit sort of for like a recruiting event and everyone was all hyped about it all my classmates were like man i'm gonna network with that person i'm gonna go become that person's best friend get the job i was just like whoa like a google software developer it was like a pokemon or something just something i wasn't ever going to see in my entire life so when they came they told us about what it is and what it takes to get a job there but in the back of my head i was still always thinking man that's just not me i'm never gonna be able to get those opportunities i specifically remember thinking that thought when there's the part where they're doing a mock interview two of the googlers went up to the white board and then one of them asked a question write me a function that can find me the path from a to b and literally my mouth just dropped because i couldn't even comprehend on where to begin this is where i was like i'm never gonna become a googler and it was so crazy because it was like a magic show literally the other developer just started to go through the problem break it down into the different pieces solve each part write this amazing function this algorithm using the right data structures to find the shortest path and for me this was a magic show this was like when you're a little kid and you see the magician pull the bunny out of the hat and you're just absolutely amazed so after that i was determined to have a conversation with that software developer i was determined to go up to him and ask him like how can i get this so that's exactly what i did i was super scared i was super nervous walking up to the guy i remember my hands were shaky palms were a little bit sweaty mom's spaghetti and then all of a sudden i go up to him and then i kind of just ask him hey man

front of me that got me inspired to take action because i want to inspire you to be able to go out there and build the skill set that you need so let's go ahead and jump into that problem guys and

button comment below let me know what you guys want to see more with data structures and algorithms because i want to give you guys more value to help you crush it to help you on your next interview so you could get that job offer so you could have that confidence not be like how i was before but actually being able to move towards having the goals that you want all right guys that is it for coach daniel i will see you in the next one peace
