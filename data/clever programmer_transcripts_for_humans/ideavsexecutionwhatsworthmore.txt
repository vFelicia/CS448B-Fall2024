00:01 - so after making this video I realized
00:03 - the camera was shaking like crazy so I'm
00:06 - sorry I don't want you guys to suffer
00:08 - from like a stroke or a seizure but I
00:10 - think that what was said in the video is
00:12 - important so worst case scenario you can
00:15 - just not look at the video and listen to
00:16 - it and I want to just apologize in
00:19 - advance I'm sorry but I think what is
00:22 - covered in the video is very important
00:24 - and I think it's applicable to every
00:26 - single one of you and it's the idea of
00:30 - ideas versus execution and what's worth
00:34 - more and what should you value and focus
00:37 - on more this can help you with Landing
00:39 - jobs this can help you with how you
00:41 - should price yourself and this can help
00:43 - you with when you're working on your
00:44 - entrepreneurial idea and you want to
00:46 - launch a business how should you value
00:50 - and how should you come up with the
00:52 - different
00:53 - percentages for ideas versus execution
00:56 - so watch this video I think it'll be
00:58 - helpful to you again I'm sorry for the
01:00 - crazy seizure shaking okay didn't
01:03 - realize that sorry
01:05 - enjoy hey guys what's up this is ky from
01:09 - clever program.com so I just got an
01:13 - email from somebody and I am like this
01:18 - one this email got me
01:21 - triggered like so hard and I wanted to
01:24 - just share that experience with you guys
01:25 - and talk to you and maybe you can tell
01:27 - me maybe I'm crazy okay
01:30 - so I got this email and we we're just
01:33 - going to call this guy
01:35 - the the 0.5% guy okay 05%
01:39 - [Music]
01:41 - guy
01:43 - and here's what happened okay so the
01:45 - email
01:47 - went hey I got this amazing idea for an
01:50 - app that I think could revolutionize the
01:53 - world
01:55 - and I found your channel and blah blah
01:58 - blah and uh I think we can work together
02:03 - so I'm like okay great usually when
02:06 - people have ideas
02:08 - of uh like revolutionizing the whole
02:11 - world it's either one of two things
02:16 - one yes they're ready for it and that
02:18 - what whatever idea they have they'll
02:20 - revolutionize the world world with two
02:24 - they're completely
02:25 - delusional let me explain why I would
02:28 - say that they are sometimes tional
02:32 - because to say such a to say such a bold
02:36 - claim you have uh you have to have some
02:39 - evidence to kind of back it up you have
02:40 - to have something that's providing some
02:42 - kind of data or some kind of analytics
02:44 - like let's say the Apple's already
02:45 - getting thousands of people and then he
02:48 - had an idea to work with me to kind of
02:50 - like improve it and take it to the next
02:54 - level then that would make a ton of
02:56 - sense I would I would totally understand
02:58 - I would be like okay if you already have
03:01 - results and now you want me to help you
03:03 - improve it so you're not delusional
03:05 - let's work on it but here's where the
03:08 - delusionality comes into play where they
03:11 - have an idea but there's nothing backing
03:14 - it
03:14 - up so that's where your detector and
03:18 - your brain goes off and you go okay um
03:22 - there's probably nothing there and they
03:23 - just want to build something from
03:24 - scratch and then they think that it's
03:26 - going to compete with Facebook and all
03:27 - that stuff so great now with that part
03:30 - out of the way the part that actually
03:32 - bothered me a lot was something
03:35 - something different okay it's okay to
03:37 - have Big Dreams because that's what
03:39 - allow us to pursue our goals right I
03:42 - don't look down on people who have a
03:43 - crazy goal like if you think you're
03:44 - going to compete with Google that's a
03:46 - great goal but you need to then start
03:49 - actually working towards it and if you
03:51 - can use energy like that to go towards
03:54 - your goal you're going to be successful
03:57 - even if you don't make something that
03:59 - would compete with Google you'll create
04:00 - something good but if you have a goal
04:02 - and you don't act on it that's when
04:04 - you're in when you're in trouble
04:07 - right uh like my own brother had this
04:10 - crazy app idea that would require like
04:12 - bajillion dollars he's like it's going
04:14 - to change the world and I have this idea
04:16 - but he didn't pursue it right so that's
04:18 - what makes it weak the idea is what
04:19 - makes it great okay let's continue
04:22 - further as to what actually bothered me
04:24 - about this particular person's message
04:28 - and triggered me
04:31 - and he said we'll work on this blah blah
04:34 - and i' and I'd like to give you a share
04:39 - uh it's a great idea and i' I've have
04:42 - I've gotten some feedback from people
04:44 - from schools and uh it it's going to be
04:47 - like a real killer in the social media
04:50 - world I said okay sounds pretty
04:52 - interesting but you know uh to be frank
04:55 - I'm kind of busy right now working a lot
04:57 - on my YouTube channel so it's not
04:59 - something I can really pursue at the
05:00 - moment it's not in line with my
05:03 - goals um I would recommend kind of
05:05 - hiring a
05:07 - developer and this gentleman said well
05:12 - kazzy if you choose to work with me then
05:14 - I would like to even give you a certain
05:16 - share or a percentage in the
05:19 - company um and I again replied I'm like
05:23 - I'm sorry it's too difficult
05:26 - um but you know I can do it and then I
05:30 - got a reply back that said this okay
05:34 - that
05:36 - said I'm going to give
05:38 - you
05:42 - 0.5%
05:47 - share
05:49 - and and if it was any other day I would
05:53 - have
05:54 - said nothing and just moved on I would
05:58 - have just ignored that email or would
06:00 - have deleted it but it wasn't any other
06:03 - day and I read it and I was
06:08 - like I replied back I mean I
06:11 - said did you
06:14 - mean 0.5 out of
06:17 - one as in 50% like is that what you
06:20 - meant to say maybe you just use the
06:22 - percentage sign incorrectly did you mean
06:25 - to say 50
06:27 - 50% and the reply came back and he said
06:31 - no I meant
06:33 - 0.5% because it's my
06:39 - idea and this brings on a huge problem
06:44 - that I want to talk about because and
06:47 - this is applicable to all of you okay so
06:50 - it's not like you're just only watching
06:52 - this right because you're on my channel
06:54 - and you know me right I I want this to
06:58 - be also applic able to you in your life
07:02 - and I'm going to tell you why it's so
07:03 - applicable and this is one big mistake
07:07 - and I think it's just it requires you to
07:09 - reframe your way of thinking people put
07:11 - way too much value on ideas and not
07:14 - enough value on
07:16 - execution the number one secret why
07:18 - Facebook became Facebook out of Myspace
07:21 - out of Twitter and out of like a
07:22 - bajillion other things do you think it's
07:25 - because of just an
07:27 - idea do you think that
07:29 - nobody else had a idea for social media
07:33 - do you think nobody had nobody else had
07:35 - the idea for
07:36 - Uber no what made those work was it the
07:41 - idea no the idea actually had very
07:44 - little to do with it everybody has an
07:46 - idea it was the execution that was key
07:50 - that made it a
07:52 - reality you
07:54 - see um this channel clever programmer as
07:58 - small as it is right
08:01 - now do you think it was an idea that
08:04 - brought it to this
08:06 - level right it wasn't it was us working
08:10 - together having a back and forth and if
08:13 - I didn't provide you value the channel
08:15 - wouldn't grow right and also it required
08:18 - on my end to work a lot make videos give
08:23 - you guys lots of things that were
08:24 - beneficial to you it wasn't my idea that
08:28 - really helped right
08:29 - yes ideas what sparked the initial thing
08:32 - like oh this is something that would be
08:34 - really cool but it was the tremendous
08:37 - amount of effort that is behind the
08:39 - scenes that's not visible to most people
08:42 - like right it's not like my chest tastic
08:44 - business that I started which was chess
08:46 - and it kind of went
08:49 - nowhere it was my idea was there but you
08:52 - know what kind of made it feel the
08:55 - execution worked really hard on it for a
08:58 - year half a year but then I kind of
09:00 - stopped if I had continued working on it
09:03 - it would have been probably at a
09:05 - completely different place right now
09:08 - so that's my point right execution is
09:13 - King work is King content is King and
09:17 - just
09:19 - talk ideas they're fluff ideas are
09:23 - almost nothing
09:26 - so in my perspective
09:29 - work is a lot more important than an
09:32 - idea okay like let's say this person had
09:35 - not a revolutionary idea some really
09:37 - crappy idea but he chose to pursue it Mr
09:42 - 0.5% if he chose to pursue it he would
09:45 - have been in a much farther place right
09:46 - now than having an idea nobody there to
09:49 - work to bring that idea to
09:53 - life so it actually should have been
09:56 - something if anything it should have
09:58 - been the opposite it should have been
10:00 - 0.5% from idea I'll give you
10:03 - 99% for actually working and bringing it
10:06 - to life right or it should be worst case
10:10 - scenario should be
10:11 - 50/50% but honestly I'm a huge believer
10:14 - that ideas are important but execution
10:16 - is king So if you just have an idea and
10:21 - you want to pitch to a software
10:22 - developer you want them to bring your
10:24 - idea to life don't say
10:28 - 0.5%
10:29 - um it takes years and years for
10:32 - businesses to grow and for that 0.5% to
10:37 - mean anything for me I would have to
10:39 - work on it for 10 years and it would
10:42 - have to be as big as Google for me to
10:45 - have some kind of Chunk that was
10:46 - actually valuable or worth it for the
10:48 - time and the effort
10:53 - so give if we have to reverse this and
10:57 - convert it into a 80 20- year rule 80%
11:00 - of your focus should be on execution
11:02 - getting technical skills and then 20% on
11:05 - the ideas okay so work on your
11:07 - negotiation skills soft skills work on
11:09 - your technical
11:10 - skills use those right those are real
11:13 - tangible things use those to build
11:15 - something ideas they're weak people
11:19 - spend months years coming up with the
11:22 - idea the website the tagline the
11:26 - logo like even looking back I don't I
11:28 - didn't need to work so hard on my logo
11:30 - for the channel or whatever like I could
11:32 - have waited and which is actually what I
11:34 - did I waited for a while but again those
11:37 - are those are ideas those are kind of
11:39 - like things
11:40 - that take a lot of time but don't really
11:43 - produce any real results so focus on
11:47 - learning things and get just get going
11:52 - you have something got an idea get going
11:55 - don't overthink it and don't value ideas
11:58 - so much and make make them this mythical
12:00 - thing okay I want you to be realistic
12:04 - optimistic but not Dreamland and wavy
12:09 - not here okay
12:13 - so
12:15 - 0.5% I I I wrote him back a long email I
12:19 - wasn't very happy um it's disrespectful
12:22 - but more importantly I just wanted to
12:24 - like I want to actually help him and
12:26 - tell
12:27 - him
12:29 - like not only how it came off but
12:32 - something that he shouldn't think about
12:34 - but then he replied to me and you
12:38 - know he he he didn't get it he just said
12:41 - oh thank you okay like he just kind of
12:44 - ignored it and that's fine and that's
12:46 - fine maybe he will make the next Google
12:48 - or the next Facebook you know who am I I
12:51 - don't know but from my personal
12:54 - experiences and also learning from Elon
12:57 - Musk Steve Jobs like all these
12:59 - autobiographies that I've read and a lot
13:01 - of these people that I follow and learn
13:04 - from that's not what happened they
13:06 - worked on it Elon Musk used to sleep TW
13:09 - like used to work for 20
13:12 - hours sleep in the same place where he
13:15 - worked and when his employees would come
13:17 - in he told them wake me up when you come
13:20 - in so he could get back to work on the
13:23 - day of their launch for uh what's now
13:26 - called PayPal it was called something
13:27 - else I can't remember commented below if
13:29 - you know but on the day when Elon Musk
13:32 - was launching it Elon Musk was the
13:33 - founder of the original
13:36 - PayPal he was up for 48 hours on the day
13:39 - of the launch do you think that was an
13:41 - idea do you think he came up with the
13:42 - idea and then went to sleep just like oh
13:44 - yeah 50% I'll get it he worked his ass
13:49 - off to make it a reality
13:52 - right
13:55 - so
13:56 - please value acttion ual work a lot more
14:00 - than intangible
14:03 - ideas there was my rant for today that's
14:06 - it guys thank you guys for watching I
14:08 - love your faces
14:10 - off comment below if you've had somebody
14:12 - approach you like this or if you had
14:14 - some pre-existing myth and just let me
14:18 - know when you think about this right
14:20 - what what would you have said to this
14:22 - 0.5% guy would you have accepted him on
14:25 - this offer am I totally wrong you know
14:28 - let me know I would like to learn
14:31 - okay thank you guys love your guys'

Cleaned transcript:

so after making this video I realized the camera was shaking like crazy so I'm sorry I don't want you guys to suffer from like a stroke or a seizure but I think that what was said in the video is important so worst case scenario you can just not look at the video and listen to it and I want to just apologize in advance I'm sorry but I think what is covered in the video is very important and I think it's applicable to every single one of you and it's the idea of ideas versus execution and what's worth more and what should you value and focus on more this can help you with Landing jobs this can help you with how you should price yourself and this can help you with when you're working on your entrepreneurial idea and you want to launch a business how should you value and how should you come up with the different percentages for ideas versus execution so watch this video I think it'll be helpful to you again I'm sorry for the crazy seizure shaking okay didn't realize that sorry enjoy hey guys what's up this is ky from clever program.com so I just got an email from somebody and I am like this one this email got me triggered like so hard and I wanted to just share that experience with you guys and talk to you and maybe you can tell me maybe I'm crazy okay so I got this email and we we're just going to call this guy the the 0.5% guy okay 05% guy and here's what happened okay so the email went hey I got this amazing idea for an app that I think could revolutionize the world and I found your channel and blah blah blah and uh I think we can work together so I'm like okay great usually when people have ideas of uh like revolutionizing the whole world it's either one of two things one yes they're ready for it and that what whatever idea they have they'll revolutionize the world world with two they're completely delusional let me explain why I would say that they are sometimes tional because to say such a to say such a bold claim you have uh you have to have some evidence to kind of back it up you have to have something that's providing some kind of data or some kind of analytics like let's say the Apple's already getting thousands of people and then he had an idea to work with me to kind of like improve it and take it to the next level then that would make a ton of sense I would I would totally understand I would be like okay if you already have results and now you want me to help you improve it so you're not delusional let's work on it but here's where the delusionality comes into play where they have an idea but there's nothing backing it up so that's where your detector and your brain goes off and you go okay um there's probably nothing there and they just want to build something from scratch and then they think that it's going to compete with Facebook and all that stuff so great now with that part out of the way the part that actually bothered me a lot was something something different okay it's okay to have Big Dreams because that's what allow us to pursue our goals right I don't look down on people who have a crazy goal like if you think you're going to compete with Google that's a great goal but you need to then start actually working towards it and if you can use energy like that to go towards your goal you're going to be successful even if you don't make something that would compete with Google you'll create something good but if you have a goal and you don't act on it that's when you're in when you're in trouble right uh like my own brother had this crazy app idea that would require like bajillion dollars he's like it's going to change the world and I have this idea but he didn't pursue it right so that's what makes it weak the idea is what makes it great okay let's continue further as to what actually bothered me about this particular person's message and triggered me and he said we'll work on this blah blah and i' and I'd like to give you a share uh it's a great idea and i' I've have I've gotten some feedback from people from schools and uh it it's going to be like a real killer in the social media world I said okay sounds pretty interesting but you know uh to be frank I'm kind of busy right now working a lot on my YouTube channel so it's not something I can really pursue at the moment it's not in line with my goals um I would recommend kind of hiring a developer and this gentleman said well kazzy if you choose to work with me then I would like to even give you a certain share or a percentage in the company um and I again replied I'm like I'm sorry it's too difficult um but you know I can do it and then I got a reply back that said this okay that said I'm going to give you 0.5% share and and if it was any other day I would have said nothing and just moved on I would have just ignored that email or would have deleted it but it wasn't any other day and I read it and I was like I replied back I mean I said did you mean 0.5 out of one as in 50% like is that what you meant to say maybe you just use the percentage sign incorrectly did you mean to say 50 50% and the reply came back and he said no I meant 0.5% because it's my idea and this brings on a huge problem that I want to talk about because and this is applicable to all of you okay so it's not like you're just only watching this right because you're on my channel and you know me right I I want this to be also applic able to you in your life and I'm going to tell you why it's so applicable and this is one big mistake and I think it's just it requires you to reframe your way of thinking people put way too much
