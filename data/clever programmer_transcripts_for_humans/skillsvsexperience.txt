00:10 - hey guys hey guys what's up this is Kazi
00:15 - from clever programmer calm so on my
00:24 - Facebook page today I got a story to
00:27 - tell you first of all check out this
00:29 - chair how awesome I feel like I'm
00:33 - strapped in like a little baby like look
00:35 - at my head it's just so strong it's so
00:40 - good okay so anyways before I waste any
00:45 - more of your time I I kind of made a
00:49 - post on my Facebook page and essentially
00:54 - it was like hey guys go check out my
00:58 - learn Python olp course which is a paid
01:01 - course I don't know why everybody goes
01:05 - so crazy about that and one of the
01:09 - gentlemen said like he saw my course and
01:14 - then he goes blah blah blah you are a
01:16 - scam your Facebook course should be
01:22 - priced at $50 and not any higher and
01:29 - I replied and I said well yes but also
01:36 - not yes and because you know there are
01:38 - lots of other things that are being
01:40 - offered in there and I specified each
01:44 - thing like okay we have a slack channel
01:46 - and then we do like life a route
01:48 - meetings and we like try to build some
01:50 - projects together and bunch of students
01:54 - even get lots of one-on-one help and
01:56 - then he responds back to me and he goes
02:00 - you're not a real software developer I
02:03 - just checked your LinkedIn you're you
02:07 - haven't worked for anybody you you are
02:12 - like a fake and so then I saw that
02:17 - message and I was like well you know I
02:22 - kind of got at that point I kind of got
02:24 - defensive I wanted to I wanted to say
02:26 - something I wanted to say something back
02:29 - but then I started thinking from this
02:33 - gentlemen's perspective and and the one
02:38 - thing I did say to him was okay you're
02:41 - not gonna go and look at the five
02:43 - hundred thousand people that are on the
02:45 - YouTube channel finding valuable
02:47 - information and you're also not gonna
02:50 - find like the five thousand people that
02:53 - we have enrolled in our courses at
02:55 - clever programmer but you're gonna like
02:57 - go look at my LinkedIn might as well
02:59 - also look at my Google+ page another
03:03 - social media thing that almost nobody
03:05 - ever uses so that was very interesting
03:09 - and you know I was trying to reason with
03:11 - this gentleman and I was like go check
03:13 - out my github and I've made apps and you
03:16 - can even see my apps and it's all like
03:17 - all open out there for the world to see
03:19 - but then I took a step back and I kind
03:22 - of stopped and I you know I got to
03:23 - thinking okay why was this person so
03:27 - emotional and why was this person who
03:29 - barely knows me probably never watched
03:31 - any of my stuff
03:32 - got like really upset about this that I
03:35 - was actually like selling a course or
03:38 - you know got personal he went from price
03:41 - of the course to
03:42 - like calling me a scam and I I I got to
03:48 - thinking and I was like okay what could
03:50 - be the reason and I think I'm kind of
03:52 - starting to understand right so he
03:56 - wasn't really upset at really what I was
04:01 - doing
04:02 - but what he was kind of upset at is how
04:06 - come I have more experience and it's
04:08 - very possible he could maybe he's a
04:10 - professional software developer I don't
04:12 - really know the gentleman but maybe he
04:16 - saw that he had so much experience and
04:18 - he just worked for so many years and
04:21 - then there's somebody else out there who
04:24 - is actually able to help more people and
04:27 - offer more valuable information to other
04:31 - people and other people are following
04:33 - that person and learning from that
04:35 - person and it ultimately comes down to
04:39 - that right I have more experience how
04:42 - can you be ahead of me how can you
04:46 - provide more value to people right that
04:52 - will happen with everybody in their
04:53 - lives that will happen with you all the
04:55 - time people will always question who
04:59 - made you the expert and they always want
05:01 - you to be the one who just backs out and
05:04 - goes yeah you're right I'm not the
05:06 - expert let me just go back let me lower
05:10 - my self-esteem let me lower my standards
05:12 - let me lower my rates because let's be
05:16 - honest I'm not an expert that's what
05:19 - they're actually trying to do they're
05:20 - trying to bring you down so when I get
05:22 - kind of that kind of feedback it's
05:24 - almost weird but I get excited I love
05:27 - that energy even if it's negative energy
05:29 - I want to take it and turn it into a
05:31 - positive energy for myself because it
05:33 - just tells me that I'm doing something
05:35 - right and it should also tell you that
05:37 - you're doing something right
05:38 - when you start to get people who really
05:40 - want to bring your energy levels down
05:42 - because they can't take it anymore it's
05:47 - actually a self projection kind of like
05:50 - how if you are you want to start a
05:53 - business or you want to do something and
05:54 - you'll
05:55 - - I don't know one of your cousins or
05:57 - your uncle or your mom or one of your
05:59 - friends and they'll be like you will
06:02 - fail and you know I love you very much
06:05 - but you know back when da da da started
06:10 - something bad person failed and then but
06:12 - back when this person started so when
06:15 - they're talking about their failures
06:18 - right they're not talking about you
06:20 - they're talking about their failures and
06:23 - they're projecting it onto and saying
06:25 - you will fail as well okay they can't
06:28 - wrap their heads around what you're
06:31 - doing or if you start to up your rates
06:35 - and actually get jobs where you are
06:37 - providing high value and also making
06:40 - lots of money back they'll be going what
06:44 - bar you can't charge that much you're
06:46 - not an expert it's not that there are
06:48 - going against you or taking a stab at
06:50 - you is that they can't justify how they
06:53 - would be able to do that and they can't
06:55 - justify why they spent so much time
06:57 - learning these things and they're not
07:00 - able to do as much as you or get as many
07:04 - things as you are getting so it's it's a
07:08 - self projection is what it is and skills
07:13 - will always beat experience and that's
07:15 - why I'm such a big you know proponent of
07:19 - that fact I am very young right and it
07:26 - doesn't matter how old you are or how
07:27 - young you are what matters is your skill
07:31 - I know for a fact that I'm better than a
07:33 - lot of software developers I'm also not
07:36 - blind and stupid and I know that there
07:38 - are but Jillian software developers who
07:40 - are better than me I don't claim to be
07:42 - the best I've never claimed to be the
07:43 - best but what's very important to
07:49 - understand is whether you as long as you
07:54 - can help somebody else that's all that
07:56 - matters that means you're gonna stay in
07:59 - business and whatever it is that you do
08:01 - so understand that skills will always
08:05 - always always be experienced
08:07 - and don't let anybody tell you otherwise
08:08 - and don't let anybody else bring you
08:11 - down because to be honest with you you
08:13 - know this stuff gets to you and like
08:18 - there are times where I'm reading it and
08:19 - I'm like wow like this is you know it
08:23 - gets kind of depressing sometimes you
08:25 - read it and you're like wow I really
08:26 - must be doing something wrong here but
08:30 - sometimes if you take a step back and
08:34 - kind of console your own self but also
08:39 - understand your own value right and you
08:44 - don't have to explain yourself to people
08:46 - but you can know what your worth is you
08:51 - know don't let people like undervalue
08:52 - you because that's what they'll always
08:54 - try to do so I just thought that that
08:58 - kind of wasn't cool but rather than just
09:04 - kind of ignoring it I wanted to share
09:06 - with you guys because I think that
09:09 - important takeaway is that skills will
09:12 - always beat experienced and wide that
09:17 - should be consoling to you is you don't
09:20 - have to be you don't have to have
09:22 - started programming when you were five
09:25 - so then when you're 20 years old you can
09:27 - say you've been programming for 15 years
09:29 - you can learn you can start learning
09:32 - when you're 20 get really good and then
09:34 - get a job all your 20 okay you don't
09:37 - need experience you need to skill so if
09:39 - you've built something then yes you will
09:42 - get that job or whatever it is that
09:43 - you're trying to get okay and this is
09:46 - regardless of just coding pretty much in
09:49 - any field of supplies also
09:55 - I am taking the mouse north chess team
10:00 - I'm also their assistant chess coach
10:02 - because that's where I graduated from
10:05 - high school and I used to play chess on
10:10 - the chess team and then ended up
10:12 - becoming top one percent in the country
10:14 - and then you know I play at
10:17 - international chess tournaments or local
10:20 - chess tournaments what have you so I'm
10:22 - going to be training them and we're
10:24 - going to state championships
10:26 - I leave this morning and then we're
10:30 - gonna be going four state championships
10:32 - in Peoria and so it's gonna be pretty
10:35 - much nothing but chess so I'm going to
10:37 - be giving chest lessons I'm going to be
10:39 - helping coach each tune one on one I
10:42 - also have to help the whole team kind of
10:44 - come together be able to work together
10:45 - throughout the tournament and I might
10:50 - also make a video or two on chess so
10:55 - that's kind of what's going to be coming
10:57 - up and yeah if I get time to make the
11:02 - video if I don't then I might not be
11:04 - here for a few days and then I'll come
11:06 - back and jump in right here with you
11:08 - guys okay that's it I just want to share
11:11 - that with you guys I love you guys so
11:13 - much take care and I will see you in the
11:16 - next video
