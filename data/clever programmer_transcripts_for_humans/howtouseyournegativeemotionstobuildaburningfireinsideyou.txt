00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:03 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm I
00:06 - want to talk about a few things I just
00:08 - actually got out of a massage and this
00:10 - was the first deep deep deep tissue
00:13 - massage I had and this thing is painful
00:15 - if you were standing outside it pretty
00:17 - much feels like I'm giving birth inside
00:18 - okay my masseuse is just telling me
00:20 - breathe deep and I'm just breathing just
00:22 - like and then they're just like she was
00:28 - just like working out all those knots
00:30 - it's really really painful
00:32 - I actually went at a dumb time which was
00:34 - right after lifting take care of your
00:36 - body take care of your body your body
00:38 - will take care of you and will take care
00:40 - of your mind
00:41 - all right so in this video I want to
00:43 - talk about the concept of using and
00:46 - leveraging negative emotions to drive
00:48 - you versus positive emotions and some of
00:51 - the advice then I'm gonna give you is
00:52 - not the general mainstream accepted
00:55 - advice okay but that's just how I think
00:58 - and I want you to just pick that advice
01:02 - up and and see if it works for you or
01:05 - not okay but I think that this will
01:07 - massively improve and change your life
01:09 - if you apply it and actually really
01:11 - understand what I'm saying and
01:12 - internalize it so let's jump right into
01:16 - it
01:17 - [Music]
01:26 - [Applause]
01:29 - so now you can use positive emotions to
01:33 - make yourself feel better right so you
01:34 - could be like hey and that's what that's
01:37 - one advice that kind of everybody gifts
01:39 - when they're like hey improve in your
01:42 - life and just like imagine it into
01:44 - existence
01:45 - and self manifestation and look in the
01:48 - mirror and say that you're the best ten
01:51 - times twenty times do affirmations do
01:55 - visualizations right in the journal your
01:58 - goals so there's just a lot of advice
02:00 - that people give on thinking about it
02:03 - positively right so now that might work
02:05 - but that could also not work for certain
02:08 - kinds of people and again you have to
02:10 - understand what personality type you are
02:12 - and what works really well for you
02:16 - that's the most important thing because
02:18 - what jives and works well with you now
02:21 - I'll give you specific examples for me
02:24 - negative emotions actually work really
02:27 - well it's not just like Oh fight yeah
02:30 - competition it's more like look at
02:32 - yourself in the mirror like if I'm
02:34 - looking at myself in the mirror just
02:35 - like what do you look like like that's
02:38 - disgusting
02:39 - you've spent ten twenty years like you
02:42 - could have been working out for the last
02:44 - five years and this is what you could
02:46 - have looked like and this is what you
02:48 - actually look like and just like really
02:52 - acknowledging it and just seeing and
02:54 - then feeling it but it doesn't make me
02:56 - cry and I don't just crumble and then I
02:58 - don't do anything about it but rather
03:00 - just like who focuses me it gives me
03:03 - that laser sharp focus because I see I
03:06 - see it and I feel the pain and I let it
03:09 - sink in and then I let it sink in deeper
03:12 - and deeper and then I allow it to move
03:17 - me towards actually starting to take
03:19 - action towards that thing okay I'll go
03:22 - deeper here even starting this clever
03:25 - programmer channel yes there were a lot
03:27 - of positive things right lots of
03:29 - subscribers maybe money ad revenue
03:33 - oh I'll become famous I'll be a public
03:36 - figure
03:36 - maybe I'll speak one day because of it
03:38 - and providing lots of value to the world
03:42 - just a lot of joy and a lot of happiness
03:45 - and changing the world now yes at
03:47 - surface level it sounds really good yes
03:50 - it sounds good
03:51 - yes a lot of people will say that that's
03:53 - their deepest well that's kind of what
03:55 - drives them and pushes them through all
03:57 - the obstacles and everything and it can
03:59 - but for me personally it works but it
04:03 - doesn't work that well so again kind of
04:06 - negative emotions work a little bit
04:08 - better for me so it's like that
04:10 - competition and competitiveness works
04:12 - better so what I was doing was like I
04:14 - would look at online channels other
04:17 - coding channels and I was like how how
04:22 - do these guys have so many views and are
04:26 - getting amazing ratings for whatever and
04:28 - how did these guys even have channels
04:29 - they're so bad at teaching this stuff
04:32 - like they're doing such injustice to the
04:35 - people actually learning this stuff
04:37 - there are much simpler ways to teach it
04:40 - why are they making it so complicated
04:42 - and then the examples that they give are
04:44 - like super obfuscated mathematical
04:47 - examples and if you're a complete
04:48 - beginner what the hell you're not gonna
04:51 - learn like that right you're looking at
04:54 - this like for example if you're a
04:56 - complete beginner wouldn't it be better
04:58 - to learn in a visual way so then when
05:00 - you do something it makes a square or
05:01 - circle and if you're wrong you'll know
05:03 - you're wrong because your code didn't
05:05 - make a circle right and so it's obvious
05:08 - but what will a professor teach you
05:11 - alright guys we will write a Fibonacci
05:14 - sequence today and so if you're a
05:16 - beginner you have no idea where you went
05:18 - wrong was your code wrong are you
05:20 - actually even wrong what was the right
05:22 - result that you were supposed to get is
05:24 - recursion really the thing to be
05:26 - learning when you barely understand how
05:27 - to do a freaking for loop right or a
05:29 - while loop so there were a lot of things
05:32 - like that right that motivated because I
05:35 - saw this and I'm like water
05:36 - people teaching this the right way
05:38 - that's just like injustice it's not fair
05:41 - and I can't believe that people actually
05:43 - watching this and you know a lot of
05:46 - people maybe they're getting value I
05:47 - don't but a lot of people are like
05:48 - honestly getting more confused than
05:50 - actually helped and so that drove my
05:54 - motivation and desire to do it at a
05:58 - deeper level and I was like God like
06:01 - this just can't be happening
06:02 - because how I grew up a lot of unfair
06:04 - stuff happening around me and it's all a
06:06 - lot of unfair stuff happened to my
06:07 - friends so I would try to protect them
06:11 - from those unfair things happening and I
06:12 - cared less about myself and more about
06:14 - other people you know as I was growing
06:16 - up putting that into perspective at my
06:19 - current age and what currently drives me
06:21 - deeper it's like seeing like for example
06:23 - if my friend something unfair was
06:25 - happening or he couldn't stand up you
06:27 - know to his parents or whatever I feel
06:30 - like no like yes you can do this like
06:33 - tell them this or you know there is a
06:36 - way to get out of the situation why are
06:37 - you okay with it why don't you change it
06:39 - like there's so many ways so that unfair
06:42 - on injustice that would happen to me
06:44 - that I tolerated when I was seeing
06:46 - happening to somebody else I'm like I
06:48 - cannot tolerate it this will not happen
06:51 - I'm not complacent with it like it has
06:53 - to change so it's similar when I'm
06:56 - looking at those channels and I'm like
06:58 - no this can't be happening I'm like I
06:59 - need to do it so that this that's why
07:02 - that drives me at a deeper level but
07:04 - maybe you know who knows like maybe
07:06 - you're young and you're like wow I'm
07:07 - gonna grow up and just self manifest
07:09 - into this amazing beautiful person and
07:12 - if it drives you great it doesn't do it
07:14 - for me so that kind of drove it deeper
07:17 - for me and you know certain other like
07:19 - and I would be like wow I need to make a
07:23 - better coding channel and there's so
07:25 - many things I could improve on so let's
07:27 - do it
07:27 - you know let's just jump into it and
07:29 - actually make it happen and then over
07:32 - time you know there are different types
07:33 - of motive
07:34 - they keep driving you but that was the
07:36 - underlying competitiveness that really
07:38 - helped me same thing when I was
07:39 - improving in chess it was a lot of the
07:41 - underlying competitiveness and the fight
07:46 - that actually motivated me and pushed me
07:48 - and if you think of competitions that's
07:50 - the same reason why people improve so
07:52 - freaking fast if they're part of a team
07:55 - and part of a competition because you
07:57 - have that fight in you that energy in
07:59 - you and then you just bring it out and
08:01 - then you push yourself beyond like what
08:04 - you could actually imagine and so it's
08:07 - actually good to have that enemy and
08:09 - have that like I need to get to this
08:11 - level and I need to get past it you know
08:13 - like John Tsongas wasn't really my enemy
08:16 - because I liked actually what he taught
08:17 - and that's why I started my channel but
08:19 - I was like I got to get to that point
08:20 - but when I was starting you know coding
08:23 - 360 I'm just calling it out but I wasn't
08:29 - really a huge fan of his content that
08:30 - was like if this guy can teach Python
08:33 - again no offense I'm like there's so
08:38 - many ways to improve upon this ok he he
08:42 - has good content but I think he honestly
08:44 - can just do so much better and and I was
08:48 - like I can improve on this I can improve
08:50 - on this so in the start it was like when
08:52 - my channel has zero subscribers yes
08:54 - there was a lot of other driving factors
08:56 - what was pushing us like I need to get
08:57 - to this point you know get to dis many
08:59 - subscribers at coding 360 has so it was
09:01 - like that internal competitiveness right
09:04 - it just brought out that competitiveness
09:06 - like alright let's go and then I would
09:09 - just like keep going and then once I
09:10 - beat his channel and it intersected and
09:13 - we beat it right like for example I'd
09:14 - look it up on social blade and social
09:16 - blade would say at this rate you're
09:18 - gonna beat this channel at five in five
09:20 - years from now and I'd be sitting and
09:23 - I'd be like really
09:24 - five years from now watch me get it down
09:25 - to one year in a week or two two weeks
09:28 - you know and so then when I would look
09:30 - at it again because my subscriber growth
09:32 - increased faster it would say okay now
09:35 - it looks so you can beat him one year
09:37 - from now and I kept getting it down so
09:38 - that competitiveness drove me
09:40 - so and then eventually I caught up to
09:43 - him and then I had I said bigger and
09:45 - bigger challenges for myself to appeal
09:47 - to that competitive part in my brain and
09:49 - keep that accountability and that
09:51 - motivation going past just a surface
09:54 - level of whatever else things I want it
09:57 - like a bigger house maybe like take my
10:00 - family on traveling things like that
10:02 - another thing that really drove me was
10:05 - and I've shared this before but like my
10:07 - mom had an accident I couldn't nobody
10:08 - could actually afford her surgery
10:10 - in my family and so seeing that and I'm
10:14 - just like how pathetic is that that you
10:16 - have a family and they're adults they
10:19 - spend their whole life
10:20 - we love this person and as a whole
10:22 - family we can't even afford her surgery
10:25 - I'm like school system is just a scam
10:28 - you get out with hundred twenty fifty
10:33 - three hundred thousand dollar loans you
10:35 - barely have a skill set that people will
10:38 - actually pay you for hire you for you
10:40 - cross your fingers hoping they'll get a
10:41 - job not really and even when you get the
10:44 - job you don't use any skills that you
10:46 - actually learned in the school and the
10:48 - people who are teaching you those
10:49 - courses don't have any skills themselves
10:51 - and they're stuck teaching it or maybe
10:54 - they do but they're not that good
10:55 - usually okay so and it's like charging
10:59 - you ridiculous prices for those classes
11:01 - okay so I was like there's no way that
11:05 - school will actually help me where I
11:07 - need to get to and all for like a below
11:09 - six-figure income if you're living in
11:11 - America and if you're living like for
11:15 - example right now in LA Hollywood yeah
11:18 - good luck surviving off of like $40,000
11:21 - a year like barely will cover your rent
11:25 - and then you have to pay taxes on it and
11:27 - then you have to actually
11:29 - do stuff like maybe get a coach or maybe
11:31 - you need to get a car or you have like
11:33 - so many extra bills and good luck if you
11:35 - need a subscription to something or you
11:36 - want to get meal prep or you want to get
11:38 - cleaning or you want actually just even
11:40 - do stuff outside good luck and then you
11:44 - think you'll be able to take care of
11:45 - your family members with that freaking
11:47 - money that where you can barely support
11:48 - yourself how disgusting is that you
11:51 - spend your you spent so much of your
11:53 - life and only enough to barely support
11:58 - yourself is that okay with you that's
12:00 - not okay with me going deeper into those
12:02 - negative emotions and actually poking at
12:06 - the things that drive you and motivate
12:07 - you alright and you're just like I can't
12:10 - hit like this level of complacency I
12:12 - just won't have it okay and just saying
12:15 - it and being honest about it I believe
12:18 - can actually help you a lot right and
12:21 - again maybe this is not the style for
12:24 - everybody okay maybe not everybody
12:26 - learns like this or improves like this
12:28 - but it does help me and maybe it can
12:30 - help you however in the mainstream media
12:32 - they'll never give you this advice so if
12:35 - you've never practiced it or try it you
12:38 - know give it a try like be extremely
12:40 - honest with yourself and don't get into
12:42 - a depressive state don't get depressed
12:46 - you know you're seeing you're like oh
12:48 - man like I want to just cry in a corner
12:50 - now but like exactly specifically see
12:53 - how much you suck at something
12:55 - understand it and then systematically
12:57 - start improving in it you know so if
12:59 - it's like table tennis there's like oh
13:00 - man like I'm just so just coordinated
13:02 - like my hands just can't even move like
13:05 - I don't know what I'm doing and then you
13:07 - know and then just like look at it I'm
13:09 - like oh man I suck so bad and then know
13:12 - exactly how much you suck so here's what
13:14 - I mean ping-pong has a rating system and
13:17 - so maybe the best player is like 3000
13:21 - rated player okay elo rating system the
13:23 - same that chest has the same that
13:24 - actually even tinder has so see what a
13:27 - 2000 level player plays that understand
13:29 - specifically what a 1600 level player
13:31 - plays that and then understand
13:33 - specifically what your rating would be
13:34 - if you played competitively so maybe
13:36 - your rating would be like 200 250 you
13:39 - suck
13:40 - then now that you know exactly how much
13:42 - you suck you could actually is that
13:44 - keemstar
13:45 - yo that was that big back to the point
13:50 - knowing and understanding exactly how
13:53 - much you suck is very important okay so
13:54 - it's like your rating is 250 now you got
13:57 - it now you know exactly what your rating
13:59 - is right and now you can look up
14:01 - material how to improve as a 250 rated
14:04 - player to get to 300 now every advice
14:07 - that will come your way as well will be
14:08 - very specific so yes first it can be
14:10 - very depressing putting yourself in a
14:11 - number oh man
14:13 - but now you have something measurable
14:15 - whereas people in life are just like a
14:17 - leaf in the wind and just like blowing
14:19 - and being controlled by their emotions
14:21 - and you know they'll play pool for their
14:24 - whole life but never actually improve in
14:26 - it or they'll code their whole life but
14:28 - just have a someone skill be at a
14:30 - specific type for their whole life and
14:32 - their typing speed is always the same
14:34 - and it's like the low average or average
14:35 - so why not actually make improvement so
14:38 - now in table tennis when you realize
14:40 - what your rating is what kind of
14:42 - material you could look at to actually
14:44 - improve that was the byproduct of
14:46 - knowing specifically and exactly how
14:49 - much you sucked okay and coming to terms
14:51 - with that and then from there improving
14:54 - and I honestly feel there's like beauty
14:57 - in that so it's like when it comes to
14:58 - fitness you know most people are just
15:00 - like oh man yeah I'm okay I'm average
15:02 - yeah I'm good
15:03 - I'm fine yeah just like okay but like
15:06 - really are you though are you at that
15:09 - level where you're happy with it you
15:11 - know what can your body actually look
15:14 - like if it was at its best ever right
15:17 - how would your muscles look like what
15:19 - would your strengths be at could you
15:20 - carry your friends something happened
15:23 - here why could you carry her if you're
15:24 - falling off of a cliff could you
15:25 - actually pull up and get back there like
15:28 - so many people who don't do a lot of
15:30 - physical activity and they'll like run
15:32 - around a little bit and just like get a
15:34 - cramp in their leg okay that's weird man
15:38 - that's kind of disgusting and so if you
15:40 - tell your brain that that's disgusting
15:41 - there's such a strong emotion such a
15:43 - strong word for example that your brain
15:46 - will be like I'm not gonna be complacent
15:47 - with this behavior whereas if you just
15:50 - tell your brain I like that's okay like
15:51 - if I eat candy
15:52 - once in a while or like I don't code
15:54 - once in a while like that's okay
15:57 - but if you're like no that's that's how
16:00 - my brain thinks okay so this might be
16:01 - aggressive for some of you
16:02 - so just tone it down to your level my
16:04 - brain is like no you're a loser
16:06 - if you don't code or your loser if
16:09 - you're not doing this there's something
16:11 - wrong with you and it needs to change
16:13 - so when I tell myself that it's like
16:16 - whoa it's like a reality check okay and
16:18 - then it actually helps me start doing
16:21 - the new thing and then eventually it
16:22 - turns into a habit and it turns into a
16:25 - system and it turned into something that
16:26 - I can improve forever I don't care about
16:30 - the surface level stuff anymore I'm
16:31 - improving at it in a much much much
16:33 - deeper level and a much much much faster
16:35 - level okay don't be okay with the
16:38 - average okay I know exactly where you
16:41 - are and know exactly how much you suck
16:43 - in the thing that you're doing and then
16:45 - improve don't be pessimistic but just be
16:49 - hyper realistic and then improve from
16:51 - there okay I'm very optimistic person if
16:53 - I'm like oh my rating in ping-pong is
16:55 - 250 I'm like I know I can get into a
16:57 - thousand or 1500 within two to three
16:59 - months but then I focus and I improve
17:01 - those skills so if you're working on the
17:03 - table tennis skill set right and you're
17:06 - like first you're just hitting the ball
17:07 - like like this or something okay
17:09 - now you could keep hitting it like this
17:10 - for the rest of your life and you'll
17:12 - never improve or you could just actually
17:14 - watch a video be like okay you know I
17:16 - need to this is like the stroke is like
17:18 - this so then you start practicing right
17:21 - so you're like
17:26 - [Music]
17:28 - and what will happen when you start to
17:30 - play like that even though you've played
17:32 - like this for years
17:33 - okay you'll play like this for years but
17:35 - now you start playing like this and what
17:37 - happens
17:40 - completely we'll get destroyed the first
17:43 - few times or maybe even for the first
17:45 - few weeks or maybe for the first few
17:47 - months because now this is a new style
17:50 - that you've actually never tried before
17:52 - and it'll completely throw you off okay
17:54 - how much you can improve with this style
17:57 - has a way bigger ceiling then how much
18:02 - you can improve with this style but this
18:03 - style it's like you'll max out right
18:05 - away but that instant gratification is
18:06 - good but with this style you can
18:09 - actually keep improving and working on
18:11 - your forward stroke for years and
18:13 - improving so maybe in a month to two
18:15 - months you'll catch up to this thing
18:16 - even though it'd be painful in the time
18:18 - being and then eventually you'll just
18:19 - smoke past it and keep improving forever
18:22 - same thing with take it for code then
18:26 - you keep coding the crappy way forever
18:27 - or you can actually start learning new
18:29 - things and keep improving okay so one of
18:32 - the things I've learned is called vim
18:33 - and it was really painful to learn vim I
18:36 - guess if you're a developer or you know
18:37 - what it is you know exactly what I mean
18:39 - what happens when you learn them the
18:41 - first time you're typing sucks you can't
18:44 - write one thing it's frustrating it's
18:46 - like man I just want to go back to how I
18:48 - regularly did things but then what
18:50 - starts to happen you start getting good
18:52 - at it it takes few weeks it takes a
18:54 - month lots of frustration it's almost
18:56 - like getting your left hand to be as
18:58 - good as your right hand and then you get
19:00 - good and then you explode past so now I
19:03 - smoke anybody who just types code or
19:06 - anything regularly because it's vim I
19:08 - can like cut lines pace lines drag lines
19:11 - go to the end of the line go to sort of
19:13 - the line the end of a word start of a
19:14 - word cut two lines take four lines and
19:17 - indent them
19:18 - it's literally magic if you see my
19:20 - screen and what happened what's
19:21 - happening whoa whoa what's happening
19:22 - that's the same thing that you can
19:24 - actually bring into your life you know
19:26 - that's what I do and I'm improving every
19:29 - time and if I'm coding magic coding the
19:31 - same way every time I'm focusing on like
19:33 - newer newer challenges and bigger
19:36 - problems that can actually solve that
19:38 - keep me improving okay but I always know
19:41 - how much I suck at something and then
19:43 - where to improve and I'm very optimistic
19:44 - because I've done it so many times
19:47 - there's so many different skill sets
19:48 - that it's a system and almost anything
19:50 - in life is a skill and you can improve
19:53 - in it systematically okay so leverage
19:56 - your negative emotions and leverage
19:59 - knowing how much you suck at something
20:00 - and don't shy away from it embrace it
20:03 - because it's gonna take you out of that
20:05 - nasty place that's I call complacency I
20:08 - think it's the darkest deepest limbo
20:11 - that anybody can ever be in that's just
20:13 - like being okay okay like oh just
20:18 - hanging out with my friends and oh looks
20:20 - like today I'm just gonna go to
20:21 - Disneyland and oh oh so fun like I like
20:25 - this party and it's cool it's cool to do
20:28 - that and have those types of days but
20:31 - you do this for a week and month and
20:33 - people are just moving with their
20:34 - emotions and feelings when they look
20:36 - back there's not a single skill set that
20:38 - they developed over at that time they
20:40 - haven't made any forward progress but
20:43 - you take actually control and you get
20:46 - out of complacency and how do you get
20:48 - out of complacency by shocking yourself
20:50 - with those types of thoughts honestly
20:52 - you know that's why Gary Vee is has like
20:54 - really dark thoughts he's like hey I
20:55 - imagine my family member like getting
20:57 - killed under a car and he's like it
20:59 - drives me and I'm like oh Sh like I
21:01 - don't want to let that happen I don't
21:03 - know he's he's he's even a little bit
21:04 - more beyond me but it helps them okay so
21:09 - understand what helps you know what
21:10 - triggers you and don't give a about
21:12 - what the mainstream thinks okay use
21:14 - those triggers to move you forward if he
21:17 - puts you in a depressive state you want
21:18 - to cry then maybe don't do it but if it
21:21 - puts you in a similar mmm like let's go
21:23 - like it brings out that fight and that
21:24 - inner competitiveness and that like that
21:27 - domination that things like self
21:30 - manifestation and just think it and
21:33 - they'll come true like Lewis Howes
21:35 - that's why I don't really enjoy a lot of
21:37 - his stuff cuz it's just like pinky and
21:39 - the wisdom and love life I don't know
21:41 - just not me
21:42 - if the dark one doesn't work for you go
21:45 - the Lewis how route right
21:47 - go to embrace the negative emotions and
21:51 - actually use them as leverage those are
21:55 - my thoughts for today that I want to
21:56 - share with you I hope that you enjoyed
21:57 - this video that's it for this video as
22:00 - always I love your faces off I actually
22:02 - didn't say it in the last video if
22:04 - somebody got upset and they're like hey
22:05 - you should say it so I love your faces
22:07 - off and I'll see you in the next video
22:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I want to talk about a few things I just actually got out of a massage and this was the first deep deep deep tissue massage I had and this thing is painful if you were standing outside it pretty much feels like I'm giving birth inside okay my masseuse is just telling me breathe deep and I'm just breathing just like and then they're just like she was just like working out all those knots it's really really painful I actually went at a dumb time which was right after lifting take care of your body take care of your body your body will take care of you and will take care of your mind all right so in this video I want to talk about the concept of using and leveraging negative emotions to drive you versus positive emotions and some of the advice then I'm gonna give you is not the general mainstream accepted advice okay but that's just how I think and I want you to just pick that advice up and and see if it works for you or not okay but I think that this will massively improve and change your life if you apply it and actually really understand what I'm saying and internalize it so let's jump right into it so now you can use positive emotions to make yourself feel better right so you could be like hey and that's what that's one advice that kind of everybody gifts when they're like hey improve in your life and just like imagine it into existence and self manifestation and look in the mirror and say that you're the best ten times twenty times do affirmations do visualizations right in the journal your goals so there's just a lot of advice that people give on thinking about it positively right so now that might work but that could also not work for certain kinds of people and again you have to understand what personality type you are and what works really well for you that's the most important thing because what jives and works well with you now I'll give you specific examples for me negative emotions actually work really well it's not just like Oh fight yeah competition it's more like look at yourself in the mirror like if I'm looking at myself in the mirror just like what do you look like like that's disgusting you've spent ten twenty years like you could have been working out for the last five years and this is what you could have looked like and this is what you actually look like and just like really acknowledging it and just seeing and then feeling it but it doesn't make me cry and I don't just crumble and then I don't do anything about it but rather just like who focuses me it gives me that laser sharp focus because I see I see it and I feel the pain and I let it sink in and then I let it sink in deeper and deeper and then I allow it to move me towards actually starting to take action towards that thing okay I'll go deeper here even starting this clever programmer channel yes there were a lot of positive things right lots of subscribers maybe money ad revenue oh I'll become famous I'll be a public figure maybe I'll speak one day because of it and providing lots of value to the world just a lot of joy and a lot of happiness and changing the world now yes at surface level it sounds really good yes it sounds good yes a lot of people will say that that's their deepest well that's kind of what drives them and pushes them through all the obstacles and everything and it can but for me personally it works but it doesn't work that well so again kind of negative emotions work a little bit better for me so it's like that competition and competitiveness works better so what I was doing was like I would look at online channels other coding channels and I was like how how do these guys have so many views and are getting amazing ratings for whatever and how did these guys even have channels they're so bad at teaching this stuff like they're doing such injustice to the people actually learning this stuff there are much simpler ways to teach it why are they making it so complicated and then the examples that they give are like super obfuscated mathematical examples and if you're a complete beginner what the hell you're not gonna learn like that right you're looking at this like for example if you're a complete beginner wouldn't it be better to learn in a visual way so then when you do something it makes a square or circle and if you're wrong you'll know you're wrong because your code didn't make a circle right and so it's obvious but what will a professor teach you alright guys we will write a Fibonacci sequence today and so if you're a beginner you have no idea where you went wrong was your code wrong are you actually even wrong what was the right result that you were supposed to get is recursion really the thing to be learning when you barely understand how to do a freaking for loop right or a while loop so there were a lot of things like that right that motivated because I saw this and I'm like water people teaching this the right way that's just like injustice it's not fair and I can't believe that people actually watching this and you know a lot of people maybe they're getting value I don't but a lot of people are like honestly getting more confused than actually helped and so that drove my motivation and desire to do it at a deeper level and I was like God like this just can't be happening because how I grew up a lot of unfair stuff happening around me and it's all a lot of unfair stuff happened to my friends so I would try to protect them from those unfair things happening and I cared less about myself and more about other people you know as I was growing up putting that into perspective at my current age and what currently drives me deeper it's like seeing like for example if my friend something unfair was happening or he couldn't stand up you know to his parents or whatever I feel like no like yes you can do this like tell them this or you know there is a way to get out of the situation why are you okay with it why don't you change it like there's so many ways so that unfair on injustice that would happen to me that I tolerated when I was seeing happening to somebody else I'm like I cannot tolerate it this will not happen I'm not complacent with it like it has to change so it's similar when I'm looking at those channels and I'm like no this can't be happening I'm like I need to do it so that this that's why that drives me at a deeper level but maybe you know who knows like maybe you're young and you're like wow I'm gonna grow up and just self manifest into this amazing beautiful person and if it drives you great it doesn't do it for me so that kind of drove it deeper for me and you know certain other like and I would be like wow I need to make a better coding channel and there's so many things I could improve on so let's do it you know let's just jump into it and actually make it happen and then over time you know there are different types of motive they keep driving you but that was the underlying competitiveness that really helped me same thing when I was improving in chess it was a lot of the underlying competitiveness and the fight that actually motivated me and pushed me and if you think of competitions that's the same reason why people improve so freaking fast if they're part of a team and part of a competition because you have that fight in you that energy in you and then you just bring it out and then you push yourself beyond like what you could actually imagine and so it's actually good to have that enemy and have that like I need to get to this level and I need to get past it you know like John Tsongas wasn't really my enemy because I liked actually what he taught and that's why I started my channel but I was like I got to get to that point but when I was starting you know coding 360 I'm just calling it out but I wasn't really a huge fan of his content that was like if this guy can teach Python again no offense I'm like there's so many ways to improve upon this ok he he has good content but I think he honestly can just do so much better and and I was like I can improve on this I can improve on this so in the start it was like when my channel has zero subscribers yes there was a lot of other driving factors what was pushing us like I need to get to this point you know get to dis many subscribers at coding 360 has so it was like that internal competitiveness right it just brought out that competitiveness like alright let's go and then I would just like keep going and then once I beat his channel and it intersected and we beat it right like for example I'd look it up on social blade and social blade would say at this rate you're gonna beat this channel at five in five years from now and I'd be sitting and I'd be like really five years from now watch me get it down to one year in a week or two two weeks you know and so then when I would look at it again because my subscriber growth increased faster it would say okay now it looks so you can beat him one year from now and I kept getting it down so that competitiveness drove me so and then eventually I caught up to him and then I had I said bigger and bigger challenges for myself to appeal to that competitive part in my brain and keep that accountability and that motivation going past just a surface level of whatever else things I want it like a bigger house maybe like take my family on traveling things like that another thing that really drove me was and I've shared this before but like my mom had an accident I couldn't nobody could actually afford her surgery in my family and so seeing that and I'm just like how pathetic is that that you have a family and they're adults they spend their whole life we love this person and as a whole family we can't even afford her surgery I'm like school system is just a scam you get out with hundred twenty fifty three hundred thousand dollar loans you barely have a skill set that people will actually pay you for hire you for you cross your fingers hoping they'll get a job not really and even when you get the job you don't use any skills that you actually learned in the school and the people who are teaching you those courses don't have any skills themselves and they're stuck teaching it or maybe they do but they're not that good usually okay so and it's like charging you ridiculous prices for those classes okay so I was like there's no way that school will actually help me where I need to get to and all for like a below sixfigure income if you're living in America and if you're living like for example right now in LA Hollywood yeah good luck surviving off of like $40,000 a year like barely will cover your rent and then you have to pay taxes on it and then you have to actually do stuff like maybe get a coach or maybe you need to get a car or you have like so many extra bills and good luck if you need a subscription to something or you want to get meal prep or you want to get cleaning or you want actually just even do stuff outside good luck and then you think you'll be able to take care of your family members with that freaking money that where you can barely support yourself how disgusting is that you spend your you spent so much of your life and only enough to barely support yourself is that okay with you that's not okay with me going deeper into those negative emotions and actually poking at the things that drive you and motivate you alright and you're just like I can't hit like this level of complacency I just won't have it okay and just saying it and being honest about it I believe can actually help you a lot right and again maybe this is not the style for everybody okay maybe not everybody learns like this or improves like this but it does help me and maybe it can help you however in the mainstream media they'll never give you this advice so if you've never practiced it or try it you know give it a try like be extremely honest with yourself and don't get into a depressive state don't get depressed you know you're seeing you're like oh man like I want to just cry in a corner now but like exactly specifically see how much you suck at something understand it and then systematically start improving in it you know so if it's like table tennis there's like oh man like I'm just so just coordinated like my hands just can't even move like I don't know what I'm doing and then you know and then just like look at it I'm like oh man I suck so bad and then know exactly how much you suck so here's what I mean pingpong has a rating system and so maybe the best player is like 3000 rated player okay elo rating system the same that chest has the same that actually even tinder has so see what a 2000 level player plays that understand specifically what a 1600 level player plays that and then understand specifically what your rating would be if you played competitively so maybe your rating would be like 200 250 you suck then now that you know exactly how much you suck you could actually is that keemstar yo that was that big back to the point knowing and understanding exactly how much you suck is very important okay so it's like your rating is 250 now you got it now you know exactly what your rating is right and now you can look up material how to improve as a 250 rated player to get to 300 now every advice that will come your way as well will be very specific so yes first it can be very depressing putting yourself in a number oh man but now you have something measurable whereas people in life are just like a leaf in the wind and just like blowing and being controlled by their emotions and you know they'll play pool for their whole life but never actually improve in it or they'll code their whole life but just have a someone skill be at a specific type for their whole life and their typing speed is always the same and it's like the low average or average so why not actually make improvement so now in table tennis when you realize what your rating is what kind of material you could look at to actually improve that was the byproduct of knowing specifically and exactly how much you sucked okay and coming to terms with that and then from there improving and I honestly feel there's like beauty in that so it's like when it comes to fitness you know most people are just like oh man yeah I'm okay I'm average yeah I'm good I'm fine yeah just like okay but like really are you though are you at that level where you're happy with it you know what can your body actually look like if it was at its best ever right how would your muscles look like what would your strengths be at could you carry your friends something happened here why could you carry her if you're falling off of a cliff could you actually pull up and get back there like so many people who don't do a lot of physical activity and they'll like run around a little bit and just like get a cramp in their leg okay that's weird man that's kind of disgusting and so if you tell your brain that that's disgusting there's such a strong emotion such a strong word for example that your brain will be like I'm not gonna be complacent with this behavior whereas if you just tell your brain I like that's okay like if I eat candy once in a while or like I don't code once in a while like that's okay but if you're like no that's that's how my brain thinks okay so this might be aggressive for some of you so just tone it down to your level my brain is like no you're a loser if you don't code or your loser if you're not doing this there's something wrong with you and it needs to change so when I tell myself that it's like whoa it's like a reality check okay and then it actually helps me start doing the new thing and then eventually it turns into a habit and it turns into a system and it turned into something that I can improve forever I don't care about the surface level stuff anymore I'm improving at it in a much much much deeper level and a much much much faster level okay don't be okay with the average okay I know exactly where you are and know exactly how much you suck in the thing that you're doing and then improve don't be pessimistic but just be hyper realistic and then improve from there okay I'm very optimistic person if I'm like oh my rating in pingpong is 250 I'm like I know I can get into a thousand or 1500 within two to three months but then I focus and I improve those skills so if you're working on the table tennis skill set right and you're like first you're just hitting the ball like like this or something okay now you could keep hitting it like this for the rest of your life and you'll never improve or you could just actually watch a video be like okay you know I need to this is like the stroke is like this so then you start practicing right so you're like and what will happen when you start to play like that even though you've played like this for years okay you'll play like this for years but now you start playing like this and what happens completely we'll get destroyed the first few times or maybe even for the first few weeks or maybe for the first few months because now this is a new style that you've actually never tried before and it'll completely throw you off okay how much you can improve with this style has a way bigger ceiling then how much you can improve with this style but this style it's like you'll max out right away but that instant gratification is good but with this style you can actually keep improving and working on your forward stroke for years and improving so maybe in a month to two months you'll catch up to this thing even though it'd be painful in the time being and then eventually you'll just smoke past it and keep improving forever same thing with take it for code then you keep coding the crappy way forever or you can actually start learning new things and keep improving okay so one of the things I've learned is called vim and it was really painful to learn vim I guess if you're a developer or you know what it is you know exactly what I mean what happens when you learn them the first time you're typing sucks you can't write one thing it's frustrating it's like man I just want to go back to how I regularly did things but then what starts to happen you start getting good at it it takes few weeks it takes a month lots of frustration it's almost like getting your left hand to be as good as your right hand and then you get good and then you explode past so now I smoke anybody who just types code or anything regularly because it's vim I can like cut lines pace lines drag lines go to the end of the line go to sort of the line the end of a word start of a word cut two lines take four lines and indent them it's literally magic if you see my screen and what happened what's happening whoa whoa what's happening that's the same thing that you can actually bring into your life you know that's what I do and I'm improving every time and if I'm coding magic coding the same way every time I'm focusing on like newer newer challenges and bigger problems that can actually solve that keep me improving okay but I always know how much I suck at something and then where to improve and I'm very optimistic because I've done it so many times there's so many different skill sets that it's a system and almost anything in life is a skill and you can improve in it systematically okay so leverage your negative emotions and leverage knowing how much you suck at something and don't shy away from it embrace it because it's gonna take you out of that nasty place that's I call complacency I think it's the darkest deepest limbo that anybody can ever be in that's just like being okay okay like oh just hanging out with my friends and oh looks like today I'm just gonna go to Disneyland and oh oh so fun like I like this party and it's cool it's cool to do that and have those types of days but you do this for a week and month and people are just moving with their emotions and feelings when they look back there's not a single skill set that they developed over at that time they haven't made any forward progress but you take actually control and you get out of complacency and how do you get out of complacency by shocking yourself with those types of thoughts honestly you know that's why Gary Vee is has like really dark thoughts he's like hey I imagine my family member like getting killed under a car and he's like it drives me and I'm like oh Sh like I don't want to let that happen I don't know he's he's he's even a little bit more beyond me but it helps them okay so understand what helps you know what triggers you and don't give a about what the mainstream thinks okay use those triggers to move you forward if he puts you in a depressive state you want to cry then maybe don't do it but if it puts you in a similar mmm like let's go like it brings out that fight and that inner competitiveness and that like that domination that things like self manifestation and just think it and they'll come true like Lewis Howes that's why I don't really enjoy a lot of his stuff cuz it's just like pinky and the wisdom and love life I don't know just not me if the dark one doesn't work for you go the Lewis how route right go to embrace the negative emotions and actually use them as leverage those are my thoughts for today that I want to share with you I hope that you enjoyed this video that's it for this video as always I love your faces off I actually didn't say it in the last video if somebody got upset and they're like hey you should say it so I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
