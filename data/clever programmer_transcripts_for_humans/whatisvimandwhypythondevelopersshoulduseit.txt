00:00 - let's give this one a try let's see if
00:02 - it works let me know if any look cool
00:07 - I'll wait so it's excellent connection
00:21 - yeah do you see me speaking like saying
00:26 - hey Cobb hey guys this or no cool ok I
00:32 - hope that it is working now I hope that
00:35 - you guys can see my face and that you
00:37 - guys can hear my voice sorry about few
00:40 - of the technical difficulties we are
00:42 - still trying to figure out this new
00:44 - system but if it works I'm saying if it
00:49 - works it's gonna be nice you guys gonna
00:54 - get some fresh fresh content
00:57 - hello ponpon from Columbia hello
01:00 - Fernando from Mexico hello sunjai hello
01:04 - Jonathan Gor re so at this point I'll
01:10 - trust that this is working and
01:15 - essentially just go from there hello
01:17 - technophile from india welcome everyone
01:21 - in this video i want to talk about what
01:24 - is them and why python developers should
01:27 - use it so vim is a really freaking
01:32 - powerful tool now all it comes down to
01:37 - is how and why you should use it ok so
01:40 - what what is it what is it at all so
01:42 - let's talk about that I'm gonna I'm just
01:45 - going to show more than I speak that way
01:47 - you'll really be able to understand what
01:49 - it is and what it does let me just make
01:53 - sure that the screen is showing up
01:56 - alright Frankie if you could just let me
01:59 - know if my picture in picture is showing
02:01 - up at the bottom right with the screen
02:02 - test that'd be great thank you or if you
02:04 - could even put it somewhere record
02:06 - well none is laughs it's fine to get
02:07 - your good
02:10 - yeah perfect perfect thank you all right
02:12 - so let's kind of jump into it so I am
02:17 - building I'm working on this to-do list
02:19 - app with Python and I was just messing
02:22 - around with it I put it together really
02:23 - quickly using Django and do you don't
02:28 - have to really worry about the app that
02:30 - I have here just worry more about them
02:35 - how I'm using them okay so let's go here
02:40 - and oh you guys can follow along by the
02:44 - way you guys can go to repla and use it
02:47 - if you want you can even go to this link
02:49 - and get this app so that's kind of cool
02:52 - right you can actually use this exact
02:54 - app for free
02:56 - enjoy all right now if you're here I
03:01 - dropped a link in the chat if you guys
03:02 - want to use it now if you're here what
03:07 - you want to do is go to settings and
03:09 - inside of settings a lots of people are
03:11 - coming on I think as you can see that
03:13 - you can go to settings and you can click
03:17 - them all right now them is enabled so
03:21 - what does them allow you to do ok so a
03:24 - few things I'm going to just start with
03:25 - very simple things I'm going to give you
03:26 - the 80/20 principles of what you
03:29 - actually need to know there's a ton of
03:31 - stuff people will teach you that I never
03:33 - even use there's just a few keys that I
03:35 - find myself using very commonly and then
03:37 - that's it all right so first up I want
03:41 - to show you that if you do DD you type
03:45 - in DD this deletes a line okay so for
03:51 - example if I go right over here and I
03:55 - hit DD it has removed the line all right
04:04 - but I have to be in vim mode so if I hit
04:07 - I I go in insert mode okay if I hit I I
04:12 - go in insert mode if I hit escape I go
04:15 - in this mode the vim mode now if I hit
04:19 - DD it removes the line now this is
04:21 - pretty
04:22 - useful when I hit you it brings the line
04:25 - back so why don't you just give that a
04:27 - try with me right now
04:28 - doo dee dee delete that thing hit you so
04:32 - it comes back that's it
04:35 - another thing you can do which I like is
04:37 - if you delete a line so I said you do
04:39 - Dee Dee on here again you can do P and P
04:44 - pastes so this is super cool sometimes
04:47 - you want to change the order of a line
04:49 - you're like hey I want to move this line
04:52 - from here and move it below this one
04:54 - okay DDP that's all it takes
04:56 - DDP okay pretty cool all right what else
05:02 - now let's say you want to go to the end
05:05 - of this line okay so I'll show you okay
05:13 - I will put you in insert mode which is
05:17 - super useful and scape will put you in
05:23 - vim mode which is super important all
05:28 - right so let's just practice that cool
05:31 - I'm just going to look at chat and see
05:33 - if you guys are practicing and if this
05:34 - yeah like you I just want to see if you
05:36 - guys are practicing so far the repli'd
05:40 - link is in the chat guys
05:47 - alright okay annoying people in the chat
06:00 - you know just we need somebody to
06:03 - moderate the chat it's kind of it
06:06 - we need golden honey back in the chat
06:08 - again sort of me needing to moderate it
06:10 - okay cool
06:12 - so you have escape mode you have insert
06:16 - mode you can delete stuff
06:18 - okay that's but you gotta practice this
06:21 - with me otherwise you're not going to
06:23 - keep up with what's going on
06:24 - so hit scape hit I hit scape hit I
06:28 - should practice that yet comfortable
06:30 - with it them is more about getting
06:31 - comfortable with it rather than going
06:34 - crazy learning every single thing about
06:36 - it
06:38 - okay what else can you do that is pretty
06:41 - important okay so I showed you delete I
06:43 - showed you escape I showed you insert
06:46 - you want to move how you move around is
06:49 - with H so H will move you left all right
07:02 - J K and L so H will move your left J
07:11 - will move you down K will move you up
07:20 - and this will move your right now this
07:27 - is the part that's most confusing for
07:29 - people so what I want you to do is kind
07:31 - of just like go in vim mode so don't be
07:34 - an insert mode going vim mode so that
07:36 - means hit escape make sure you have the
07:40 - key bindings for vim enabled and you can
07:44 - just go to rep lit alright and just open
07:46 - up Python so you don't have to be in my
07:48 - thing you can just go to repla and open
07:50 - up a Python thing that's all
07:55 - all right so let's say you hit escape
07:59 - and you're in this mode now just
08:00 - practice moving around so okay I'm going
08:03 - to say go up up up up so every time I
08:08 - hae say up you should be hitting K up up
08:12 - up let's go down down down down
08:17 - so that's JJJ okay and then to move left
08:20 - and right is essentially H so you
08:23 - practice that a little bit I'll practice
08:25 - that a little bit okay now all this
08:29 - stuff seems really obfuscated but I want
08:31 - to I want to really tell you what
08:33 - actually ends up happening
08:34 - once you learn vim like what's the
08:36 - benefit why should you learn this you
08:39 - can literally you can do your projects
08:45 - twice as fast which means that as a
08:50 - freelancer if you're freelancing you can
08:54 - you can get paid twice as much all right
09:01 - so that's the long-term vision for while
09:04 - you're learning this now here are a few
09:05 - things to be aware of that will happen
09:07 - for sure
09:13 - you're put your productivity for the
09:18 - next two months will drop will drop down
09:25 - to will drop down by say 60% it's almost
09:33 - like when you're learning a new language
09:35 - so if you went from your language
09:37 - learning a new language in you know in
09:40 - human languages your productivity will
09:42 - drop and it will be really frustrating
09:44 - so it'll be really a very frustrating
09:46 - experience but once you actually learn
09:52 - it then your growth is going to be
09:54 - exponential okay so growth becomes
09:59 - exponential
10:03 - within one year you'll if you're working
10:11 - at a job you'll be able to see an ROI
10:13 - you'll be able you'll be able to see an
10:17 - ROI you'll be able to write 1.75 X to 2x
10:28 - more code which really means that if
10:34 - you're trying to learn and you're a
10:35 - beginner and a lot of you who are on my
10:37 - channel are beginners you will cut down
10:40 - cut down your learning curve from God
10:45 - like three years of time down to one
10:50 - year of time all right
10:54 - because you'll literally be able to make
10:56 - the same amount of mistakes in just a
10:58 - much shorter period of time which will
11:01 - allow you to improve at a much more
11:02 - rapid pace so I'll say this this is why
11:09 - you should learn them all right so
11:13 - that's the thing I want to put there now
11:16 - here is where we're kind of doing our
11:17 - technical training part of it if that
11:22 - makes sense okay
11:34 - what's going on Oh my brother is here
11:37 - cause wait what's up man and yeah thanks
11:40 - for reporting and it's kind of annoying
11:41 - yes throw the toxic people out it just
11:44 - kind of throws me off my game
11:46 - okay so how has it been so far is it
11:49 - kind of making sense
11:51 - Carlos's uses them every day great
11:55 - JavaScript developers great okay I'll
11:58 - throw in the link again if you guys need
12:00 - it
12:01 - throw that in boom okay so first of all
12:07 - does it make sense guys why you should
12:09 - be using them like I just want to make
12:13 - that clear like that make sense or if
12:15 - yeah if that makes sense to you guys
12:19 - because if you understand what the
12:23 - benefit of it is then you'll learn like
12:27 - you you're smart a lot of you are really
12:30 - smart people I've spoken with a lot of
12:32 - you guys and especially when it comes to
12:34 - the developer world world I know you're
12:37 - a self learner I know that you can think
12:41 - on your own time and pick up skills I
12:43 - know that you have the skill of
12:46 - researching down and self learning down
12:50 - so if the main thing is if I can get the
12:54 - benefits across to you of why it would
12:57 - be helpful for you then learning it as
13:02 - easy part okay learning is the really
13:04 - easy part so this is all your movement
13:16 - this is your movement okay I'll do that
13:23 - and these are some of your this is I
13:27 - mean this is just essential so I'll put
13:30 - this at the top you you must these are
13:33 - must I mean this is them itself like
13:37 - otherwise you can't even use them if you
13:40 - don't get these keys down okay and then
13:47 - I'm going to give you so yeah I really
13:51 - want to give you the 80 20s of why you
13:54 - should use them okay
14:07 - the next thing you need is really the P
14:10 - is really awesome paste this is
14:12 - something I commonly find myself doing
14:14 - so DDP
14:15 - you know it and then you do undo so I'll
14:19 - put that as well you do so if you guys
14:29 - notice how I'm moving around it's pretty
14:30 - frickin insane
14:32 - I'm using vim obviously so for example
14:34 - how did I do this I just deleted and
14:37 - deleted this entire line and started
14:39 - writing from here right what would most
14:42 - of the people do start deleting like
14:45 - this or if you're trying to be fancy you
14:49 - like highlight it but you're still
14:50 - having to now use the mouse move the
14:53 - keyboard around there's a lot that you
14:55 - might be doing that I might not have to
14:57 - do alright
15:03 - so you undo super important so I'll do
15:08 - DD and then I'll do you cool
15:13 - P is for paste okay
15:21 - other ones they are really helpful or
15:24 - let's say that I want to change where it
15:26 - says context dictionary I want to change
15:29 - this variable name so instead of context
15:32 - dictionary maybe I want to call it box
15:36 - so what would you do you would go and
15:39 - you would highlight it and maybe you're
15:41 - right box or you might go here and you
15:46 - might change it right like you might do
15:48 - it like this but what I like to do here
15:53 - is I change the inner word okay
15:57 - so how I do that is see iw so iw is like
16:03 - a modifier so when i do c IW c i w okay
16:11 - one at a time literally one at a time c
16:16 - IW this lets me change a word
16:24 - so if I do this I can change the word
16:26 - eventually it becomes my habit so I
16:29 - don't think about like boom boom but
16:33 - this requires a lot of time and practice
16:38 - so I'm gonna call box that easy okay so
16:41 - saves me a lot of time let me go and see
16:45 - what's happening in the chat completely
16:48 - makes a lot of sense I understand and I
16:51 - live it's everyday benefits great great
16:54 - okay now another important one that I
17:03 - want to write down for you guys is yank
17:09 - so that's why why so if I want to copy a
17:13 - line let's say I want to copy this line
17:15 - why why and if I want to paste it I'll
17:18 - do P and you to undo so why why P cool
17:24 - why why P that's it pretty simple
17:33 - this is yank yank and paste go together
17:37 - you know they're really helpful these
17:40 - are these are some of the most helpful
17:42 - ones if you want to go here and change
17:45 - this word what are you going to do quick
17:47 - question for you drop it in the chat if
17:49 - you know how to change a word quickly if
17:52 - you want to learn take active part in
17:55 - this so if I'm asking you how do I
17:58 - change that word let me know right now
18:00 - exactly what you're going to do without
18:01 - having to refer to what I wrote if you
18:04 - just CI W great job really quickly if
18:07 - you have to copy a line what are you
18:10 - going to do
18:12 - if you said YY awesome all right
18:17 - oh sorry for the other one you show says
18:19 - CI w yeah I did say that cool okay if
18:23 - you have to delete a line what are you
18:24 - going to do DD okay so I know that very
18:29 - quickly is starting to be lots of things
18:31 - about my goal in this video is really to
18:34 - just give you all the most common things
18:37 - and then that's it
18:38 - you know there's just a few more then
18:40 - you're good you're all caught up
18:42 - alright then it just need to practice
18:43 - and practice prep like day in and day
18:45 - out but I'm literally going to give you
18:47 - the stuff that will help you 95% of the
18:50 - time and then everything else is just
18:51 - fancy stuff that's it I use my vim with
18:57 - PyCharm so I actually don't even need I
18:59 - don't even need them the text editor
19:07 - because my philosophy is why why use vim
19:11 - text editor when you can use a modern
19:13 - day IDE integrated development
19:16 - environment which is a million times
19:18 - more powerful such as PyCharm
19:20 - and then you can use them inside of that
19:23 - so pycharm allows you to use them so why
19:26 - not use pycharm
19:28 - with vim it's just so much better
19:34 - okay so here we go cool so if there's
19:49 - ciaw which is change word quick question
19:52 - what's di W real quick
19:56 - delete word okay so if I wanna delete
19:59 - this word I can just do that but the
20:04 - reason why I showed you CI W is usually
20:07 - when you're trying to delete a word
20:08 - you're trying to replace it with
20:09 - something else
20:10 - so that's why I gave you CI w because
20:13 - when you do because if I do CI w here
20:24 - it not only deletes it but it puts me in
20:27 - insert mode which means that I can now
20:31 - start writing okay so if DD deletes the
20:36 - line what does CC do
20:49 - it allows you to change a line okay so
20:56 - with CC you can change a line with DD
20:58 - you can delete a line now a few other
21:03 - things okay Capital D allows you to
21:21 - basically allows you to delete from
21:25 - where your cursor is quick question
21:30 - what does capital C allow you to do
21:35 - change from where your cursor is okay so
21:41 - what does that mean if I'm in context
21:46 - dictionary and I just want to change
21:47 - what's after this equal sign I can just
21:50 - do what command C or shift C sorry okay
21:58 - if I want to delete all of this then I
22:01 - just do shift D that's it okay
22:10 - other ones that you need to know are
22:15 - a-okay a I'll also put insert so this is
22:23 - useful sometimes because if I want to go
22:30 - before the e then I will do I if I want
22:35 - to go after the e then I will do a now
22:40 - where this modifier comes in handy is if
22:44 - I did capital I this will insert the
22:50 - four line and can you guess what capital
22:55 - a would do insert after line that's
22:59 - right so for example if I'm in vim mode
23:02 - and I do shift I I'll go all the way to
23:04 - the start if I do shift a I'll go all
23:08 - the way to the end that's also where it
23:12 - becomes really helpful
23:13 - oh another really important one that
23:17 - I'll tell you and this goes in movement
23:19 - super super helpful would be when I'm
23:27 - traveling I see yeah I'm going by
23:32 - yeah so I usually go by e that allows
23:39 - you to move to the end of each word okay
23:46 - so move to end of words I barely ever
23:51 - use W so I won't even mention it but W
23:54 - allows you to move to the start of words
23:56 - I mean I use it sometimes I'll put it
23:59 - here
24:00 - move to move by words
24:23 - all right
24:25 - so there you go now another one that's
24:28 - super useful is that will really be
24:31 - helpful for you is B so move backwards
24:37 - by words super powerful okay so you can
24:43 - do BB BB okay so between BB and E and W
24:48 - it's really helpful to move like that
24:58 - boon lots of answers coming in vim and B
25:07 - what is the difference hmm not much
25:10 - difference TD yep Tony wants to make a
25:21 - pyramid with hashes nice Tony just join
25:24 - profitable programmer that's awesome
25:27 - okay so let's go here and do this format
25:33 - because I'm OCD okay so I'm thinking
25:38 - about what other wants to give you okay
25:40 - because I've found when I'm travelling
25:41 - through all this
25:43 - this app is cool too it's okay
25:46 - username is admin password is admin like
25:51 - hello stuff to do homework coding this
26:01 - is this is coded in Python by the way
26:03 - Jango so if you want to use this app
26:07 - feel free to use it all right let me
26:12 - think what else is useful for you so go
26:17 - to the end go to a beginning go by words
26:19 - go backwards delete another one I find
26:25 - myself using for movement a lot is ctrl
26:28 - D and control you
26:57 - so this is like allows me to move fast
27:00 - through the thing because it just moves
27:02 - me up by pages and down by pages so
27:05 - really helpful so I'll just hold ctrl
27:07 - and I'm tapping D and then I'll just
27:09 - keep holding ctrl and keep tapping you
27:11 - and that's it okay so okay going to the
27:20 - beginning going to D and yeah so this is
27:25 - really the crux of it if you get DS
27:29 - right I mean this is essentially 80% of
27:33 - what you need to do trying to think what
27:38 - else is useful for use of CI double use
27:41 - useful di WNYW so again you can notice
27:44 - the patterns right see it's change so
27:48 - constantly everywhere you'll see any set
27:51 - type of C stuff i dub you as a modifier
27:55 - so you just do c IW just changes the
27:58 - word you know di w deletes the word let
28:01 - me ask you what why i dub you does so
28:05 - real quick drop in the chat before i
28:08 - answer it what does y IW do if you said
28:13 - it Yanks the word great job so yank word
28:16 - okay because it's just yank just really
28:19 - means copy okay so i'm just gonna write
28:22 - that it just means a copy word copy word
28:24 - they just use yank in their terminology
28:28 - that's all it means
28:30 - so you know if i'm going here on a copy
28:33 - the word done now if i pasted it it
28:35 - pasted that word that's helpful
28:39 - okay another useful one is r this allows
28:47 - you to replace so for example if I want
28:53 - to replace T instead of hitting a to go
28:56 - in insert mode then hitting backspace
28:58 - and then typing in T what I can do is I
29:01 - can do
29:02 - ar e R T so are just kind of lets me do
29:09 - it on the fly now this is like more
29:11 - micro optimization you know I would not
29:14 - put this in the 80/20 so you know I'll
29:17 - call this like 80/20 and I'll put this
29:30 - in like fancy stuff alright you don't
29:32 - really need this but this is helpful
29:35 - this is just like optimization but
29:39 - really this is the this is all of that
29:43 - is ad part of the 80/20 right so you
29:47 - will put in 20% effort here and you'll
29:50 - get 80% results from these let me check
29:59 - on the chat what's going on Hudson says
30:03 - remember me what's up Hudson um can I do
30:11 - your course the profitable programmer
30:13 - 2.0 at my own pace yes you can you can
30:17 - do it at your own pace definitely it's
30:20 - yeah just if you want to go slow go slow
30:24 - when I go fast you can go fast just go
30:26 - at your own pace okay what else we got
30:31 - in here
30:38 - Tony to do nested loops it's not too
30:41 - complex just a test it just depends what
30:44 - you want to use them for but yeah the
30:47 - nested loops are they're fun they're fun
30:52 - okay let me think about what else can I
30:55 - offer in this that still is part of the
30:59 - 80/20 so that like I'm telling you the
31:03 - stuff that I use
31:03 - all right I'm telling you the stuff that
31:05 - I commonly use its exhaustive the amount
31:07 - of things you can learn but I don't
31:10 - recommend learning all of them just
31:12 - learn the stuff that you really need to
31:14 - get going okay so you got e you know B
31:17 - you got shift a you got shift I which
31:20 - you know practice that right now
31:22 - actually so shift I shifted just keep
31:25 - practicing it keep drilling like if
31:27 - you're on this live stream and you're
31:29 - hearing my voice just keep using that as
31:30 - like a drilling exercise because the
31:34 - more you practice this stuff the better
31:35 - you'll become if you use it like this
31:38 - weird tool and you give it so much
31:39 - respect you'll never learn it you'll get
31:41 - better at it in a really slow way just
31:44 - look to make mistakes look to really
31:47 -  up and have fun all right so the
31:49 - more mistakes you make and the more you
31:51 - crash and burn stuff that's better
31:53 - you'll improve like that so shift a
31:56 - scape shift icescape shift a shift I
32:00 - escape shift a escape shift I cool EEE
32:05 - BBB BBB okay all right change this word
32:12 - oh crap didn't mean to do that hit scape
32:14 - hit you di w delete the word oh crap
32:19 - didn't mean to do that hit you shift I
32:21 - escape delete the line okay
32:24 - delete this line paste it underneath
32:26 - this one so DDP delete this paste it on
32:31 - top all right so that's another one that
32:33 - I'll show you which is cool
32:37 - P is like pasted on top okay and most
32:46 - things have a shift version of them so I
32:49 - believe redo is shift you I believe
32:53 - let me actually try that hello I guess
32:59 - not I don't know what it is it could be
33:02 - like sometimes I'm not even thinking
33:04 - about the things I'm typing I'm just my
33:07 - muscle memory is just built-in so I'll
33:08 - just do them without really ever
33:10 - thinking about it and if somebody's in
33:14 - the chat who knows about it you're a
33:16 - feel free to drop something that I may
33:19 - be missing or something that you use
33:21 - that's helpful so Carlos if you want to
33:23 - add something that'd be great
33:25 - ah module that's awesome man welcome
33:30 - yeah module used to go to our Chess Club
33:32 - yeah welcome welcome
33:35 - and yeah Python is awesome so definitely
33:38 - go and take advantage of things okay
33:43 - yeah if you guys will find a tutorial
33:45 - useful for how I actually made this app
33:47 - the to-do list app and what I did I can
33:51 - definitely do that for you guys at some
33:53 - point for sure cool that's a that's what
34:00 - I wanted to share I think that takes
34:03 - care of a lot of what this is about
34:09 - let me see if I can fork this
34:20 - nope doesn't allow me to create a fork
34:22 - of it trying to create a fork and put it
34:28 - in the description
34:29 - ah 10 10 plus DD yep yep yep that's a
34:35 - good one that's a good one too for sure
34:38 - redo is control-r yep yep yep yep okay
34:42 - cool
34:43 - so redo is definitely important so let's
34:48 - add that do conceit eo+ are okay that I
34:56 - all I use a lot I just literally like
35:02 - muscle memory so yeah redo there you go
35:05 - that's important
35:06 - another one that's cool is I'll put this
35:10 - in fancy stuff is if you want to delete
35:12 - two lines actually this is this is
35:15 - useful so you can do this okay - DD
35:21 - delete two lines 10 DD or you know 10 DD
35:30 - deletes 10 lines okay so for example if
35:34 - I am here and I want to delete line 63
35:38 - and line 64 so I want to delete context
35:40 - dictionary variable and this return
35:42 - statement I'll press - and then I'll do
35:45 - DD that's it
35:50 - if I want to copy something like this
35:52 - fancy stuff and paste it 10 times 10 PP
35:56 - cool let's say 10 P or 30 P pasted it 30
36:05 - times really dope stuff you can do with
36:09 - this so that's another one okay let's
36:17 - see if I'm missing anything else
36:18 - Oh am I not using the Yeti that would be
36:29 - the most depressing
36:33 - oh I am I am using the Yeti I'm using
36:36 - the Yeti change inside parenthesis see I
36:44 - let me see that one
36:47 - see I okay so that would be useful let's
36:55 - say if I had multiple things oh that's
37:01 - nice oh yeah I love learning stuff like
37:06 - this okay cool
37:07 - I'm putting that down that's
37:09 - awesome I like that one a lot
37:11 - thank you who shared that one yo rishabh
37:14 - shout out to Rashad aha awesome Rochelle
37:20 - I see you man that was awesome
37:31 - I'm gonna put that in fancy stuff
37:33 - because I didn't know that until now and
37:35 - I was getting by fine definitely super
37:39 - helpful what else we got change inside
37:46 - brackets CI cool okay great oh yeah X is
37:57 - another one I use this helpful
37:58 - I'm going to put that here
38:06 - this is helpful because if you want to
38:08 - like delete something you know let's say
38:11 - there's an extra word here like that and
38:14 - you don't want to get out of vim mode to
38:17 - go eh and then press Delete I mean
38:19 - that's really expensive right like
38:21 - you're doing so many things
38:22 - justly you just do X X and then it
38:25 - deletes it hacker says what do I do if I
38:34 - want to be a full stack developer but
38:37 - because the financial issues can't pay
38:39 - for your 2.0 course that's totally fine
38:44 - there is a lot of stuff on full stack
38:47 - online learn it and then once you start
38:51 - earning an income you can join my
38:53 - program and my program what's the main
38:59 - the main difference in my program is
39:01 - just that it will show you freelancing
39:04 - stuff and most places won't show you how
39:08 - to do freelance freelancing or earning
39:10 - an income from coding so that's the main
39:13 - difference of my program yeah so for now
39:19 - you can just enjoy all the free stuff I
39:21 - have tons of YouTube content and you can
39:23 - you can go through that
39:25 - alright hackers is happy papa Python
39:29 - Rishabh is saying thank you yep you're
39:32 - welcome I'm and thank you for sharing
39:34 - that
39:34 - that was super useful cool all right
39:39 - that's all I got for you guys this is a
39:43 - great guide a quick question if anybody
39:47 - wants a downloadable cheat sheet of this
39:49 - or if you want yeah they're a
39:54 - downloadable cheat sheet or all this in
39:57 - one area emailed to you or something you
39:59 - know just let me know in the chat and if
40:01 - we have enough people
40:03 - maybe I'll I'll do something I'll do
40:06 - something about that
40:10 - okay I might put that in the description
40:14 - of this video or something alright thank
40:16 - you guys so much I love your face
40:19 - and if always I'll see you well hold on
40:26 - hold on I got it I got to do the cool
40:27 - stuff I love your face this is cozy as
40:32 - always I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

let's give this one a try let's see if it works let me know if any look cool I'll wait so it's excellent connection yeah do you see me speaking like saying hey Cobb hey guys this or no cool ok I hope that it is working now I hope that you guys can see my face and that you guys can hear my voice sorry about few of the technical difficulties we are still trying to figure out this new system but if it works I'm saying if it works it's gonna be nice you guys gonna get some fresh fresh content hello ponpon from Columbia hello Fernando from Mexico hello sunjai hello Jonathan Gor re so at this point I'll trust that this is working and essentially just go from there hello technophile from india welcome everyone in this video i want to talk about what is them and why python developers should use it so vim is a really freaking powerful tool now all it comes down to is how and why you should use it ok so what what is it what is it at all so let's talk about that I'm gonna I'm just going to show more than I speak that way you'll really be able to understand what it is and what it does let me just make sure that the screen is showing up alright Frankie if you could just let me know if my picture in picture is showing up at the bottom right with the screen test that'd be great thank you or if you could even put it somewhere record well none is laughs it's fine to get your good yeah perfect perfect thank you all right so let's kind of jump into it so I am building I'm working on this todo list app with Python and I was just messing around with it I put it together really quickly using Django and do you don't have to really worry about the app that I have here just worry more about them how I'm using them okay so let's go here and oh you guys can follow along by the way you guys can go to repla and use it if you want you can even go to this link and get this app so that's kind of cool right you can actually use this exact app for free enjoy all right now if you're here I dropped a link in the chat if you guys want to use it now if you're here what you want to do is go to settings and inside of settings a lots of people are coming on I think as you can see that you can go to settings and you can click them all right now them is enabled so what does them allow you to do ok so a few things I'm going to just start with very simple things I'm going to give you the 80/20 principles of what you actually need to know there's a ton of stuff people will teach you that I never even use there's just a few keys that I find myself using very commonly and then that's it all right so first up I want to show you that if you do DD you type in DD this deletes a line okay so for example if I go right over here and I hit DD it has removed the line all right but I have to be in vim mode so if I hit I I go in insert mode okay if I hit I I go in insert mode if I hit escape I go in this mode the vim mode now if I hit DD it removes the line now this is pretty useful when I hit you it brings the line back so why don't you just give that a try with me right now doo dee dee delete that thing hit you so it comes back that's it another thing you can do which I like is if you delete a line so I said you do Dee Dee on here again you can do P and P pastes so this is super cool sometimes you want to change the order of a line you're like hey I want to move this line from here and move it below this one okay DDP that's all it takes DDP okay pretty cool all right what else now let's say you want to go to the end of this line okay so I'll show you okay I will put you in insert mode which is super useful and scape will put you in vim mode which is super important all right so let's just practice that cool I'm just going to look at chat and see if you guys are practicing and if this yeah like you I just want to see if you guys are practicing so far the repli'd link is in the chat guys alright okay annoying people in the chat you know just we need somebody to moderate the chat it's kind of it we need golden honey back in the chat again sort of me needing to moderate it okay cool so you have escape mode you have insert mode you can delete stuff okay that's but you gotta practice this with me otherwise you're not going to keep up with what's going on so hit scape hit I hit scape hit I should practice that yet comfortable with it them is more about getting comfortable with it rather than going crazy learning every single thing about it okay what else can you do that is pretty important okay so I showed you delete I showed you escape I showed you insert you want to move how you move around is with H so H will move you left all right J K and L so H will move your left J will move you down K will move you up and this will move your right now this is the part that's most confusing for people so what I want you to do is kind of just like go in vim mode so don't be an insert mode going vim mode so that means hit escape make sure you have the key bindings for vim enabled and you can just go to rep lit alright and just open up Python so you don't have to be in my thing you can just go to repla and open up a Python thing that's all all right so let's say you hit escape and you're in this mode now just practice moving around so okay I'm going to say go up up up up so every time I hae say up you should be hitting K up up up let's go down down down down so that's JJJ okay and then to move left and right is essentially H so you practice that a little bit I'll practice that a little bit okay now all this stuff seems really obfuscated but I want to I want to really tell you what actually ends up happening once you learn vim like what's the benefit why should you learn this you can literally you can do your projects twice as fast which means that as a freelancer if you're freelancing you can you can get paid twice as much all right so that's the longterm vision for while you're learning this now here are a few things to be aware of that will happen for sure you're put your productivity for the next two months will drop will drop down to will drop down by say 60% it's almost like when you're learning a new language so if you went from your language learning a new language in you know in human languages your productivity will drop and it will be really frustrating so it'll be really a very frustrating experience but once you actually learn it then your growth is going to be exponential okay so growth becomes exponential within one year you'll if you're working at a job you'll be able to see an ROI you'll be able you'll be able to see an ROI you'll be able to write 1.75 X to 2x more code which really means that if you're trying to learn and you're a beginner and a lot of you who are on my channel are beginners you will cut down cut down your learning curve from God like three years of time down to one year of time all right because you'll literally be able to make the same amount of mistakes in just a much shorter period of time which will allow you to improve at a much more rapid pace so I'll say this this is why you should learn them all right so that's the thing I want to put there now here is where we're kind of doing our technical training part of it if that makes sense okay what's going on Oh my brother is here cause wait what's up man and yeah thanks for reporting and it's kind of annoying yes throw the toxic people out it just kind of throws me off my game okay so how has it been so far is it kind of making sense Carlos's uses them every day great JavaScript developers great okay I'll throw in the link again if you guys need it throw that in boom okay so first of all does it make sense guys why you should be using them like I just want to make that clear like that make sense or if yeah if that makes sense to you guys because if you understand what the benefit of it is then you'll learn like you you're smart a lot of you are really smart people I've spoken with a lot of you guys and especially when it comes to the developer world world I know you're a self learner I know that you can think on your own time and pick up skills I know that you have the skill of researching down and self learning down so if the main thing is if I can get the benefits across to you of why it would be helpful for you then learning it as easy part okay learning is the really easy part so this is all your movement this is your movement okay I'll do that and these are some of your this is I mean this is just essential so I'll put this at the top you you must these are must I mean this is them itself like otherwise you can't even use them if you don't get these keys down okay and then I'm going to give you so yeah I really want to give you the 80 20s of why you should use them okay the next thing you need is really the P is really awesome paste this is something I commonly find myself doing so DDP you know it and then you do undo so I'll put that as well you do so if you guys notice how I'm moving around it's pretty frickin insane I'm using vim obviously so for example how did I do this I just deleted and deleted this entire line and started writing from here right what would most of the people do start deleting like this or if you're trying to be fancy you like highlight it but you're still having to now use the mouse move the keyboard around there's a lot that you might be doing that I might not have to do alright so you undo super important so I'll do DD and then I'll do you cool P is for paste okay other ones they are really helpful or let's say that I want to change where it says context dictionary I want to change this variable name so instead of context dictionary maybe I want to call it box so what would you do you would go and you would highlight it and maybe you're right box or you might go here and you might change it right like you might do it like this but what I like to do here is I change the inner word okay so how I do that is see iw so iw is like a modifier so when i do c IW c i w okay one at a time literally one at a time c IW this lets me change a word so if I do this I can change the word eventually it becomes my habit so I don't think about like boom boom but this requires a lot of time and practice so I'm gonna call box that easy okay so saves me a lot of time let me go and see what's happening in the chat completely makes a lot of sense I understand and I live it's everyday benefits great great okay now another important one that I want to write down for you guys is yank so that's why why so if I want to copy a line let's say I want to copy this line why why and if I want to paste it I'll do P and you to undo so why why P cool why why P that's it pretty simple this is yank yank and paste go together you know they're really helpful these are these are some of the most helpful ones if you want to go here and change this word what are you going to do quick question for you drop it in the chat if you know how to change a word quickly if you want to learn take active part in this so if I'm asking you how do I change that word let me know right now exactly what you're going to do without having to refer to what I wrote if you just CI W great job really quickly if you have to copy a line what are you going to do if you said YY awesome all right oh sorry for the other one you show says CI w yeah I did say that cool okay if you have to delete a line what are you going to do DD okay so I know that very quickly is starting to be lots of things about my goal in this video is really to just give you all the most common things and then that's it you know there's just a few more then you're good you're all caught up alright then it just need to practice and practice prep like day in and day out but I'm literally going to give you the stuff that will help you 95% of the time and then everything else is just fancy stuff that's it I use my vim with PyCharm so I actually don't even need I don't even need them the text editor because my philosophy is why why use vim text editor when you can use a modern day IDE integrated development environment which is a million times more powerful such as PyCharm and then you can use them inside of that so pycharm allows you to use them so why not use pycharm with vim it's just so much better okay so here we go cool so if there's ciaw which is change word quick question what's di W real quick delete word okay so if I wanna delete this word I can just do that but the reason why I showed you CI W is usually when you're trying to delete a word you're trying to replace it with something else so that's why I gave you CI w because when you do because if I do CI w here it not only deletes it but it puts me in insert mode which means that I can now start writing okay so if DD deletes the line what does CC do it allows you to change a line okay so with CC you can change a line with DD you can delete a line now a few other things okay Capital D allows you to basically allows you to delete from where your cursor is quick question what does capital C allow you to do change from where your cursor is okay so what does that mean if I'm in context dictionary and I just want to change what's after this equal sign I can just do what command C or shift C sorry okay if I want to delete all of this then I just do shift D that's it okay other ones that you need to know are aokay a I'll also put insert so this is useful sometimes because if I want to go before the e then I will do I if I want to go after the e then I will do a now where this modifier comes in handy is if I did capital I this will insert the four line and can you guess what capital a would do insert after line that's right so for example if I'm in vim mode and I do shift I I'll go all the way to the start if I do shift a I'll go all the way to the end that's also where it becomes really helpful oh another really important one that I'll tell you and this goes in movement super super helpful would be when I'm traveling I see yeah I'm going by yeah so I usually go by e that allows you to move to the end of each word okay so move to end of words I barely ever use W so I won't even mention it but W allows you to move to the start of words I mean I use it sometimes I'll put it here move to move by words all right so there you go now another one that's super useful is that will really be helpful for you is B so move backwards by words super powerful okay so you can do BB BB okay so between BB and E and W it's really helpful to move like that boon lots of answers coming in vim and B what is the difference hmm not much difference TD yep Tony wants to make a pyramid with hashes nice Tony just join profitable programmer that's awesome okay so let's go here and do this format because I'm OCD okay so I'm thinking about what other wants to give you okay because I've found when I'm travelling through all this this app is cool too it's okay username is admin password is admin like hello stuff to do homework coding this is this is coded in Python by the way Jango so if you want to use this app feel free to use it all right let me think what else is useful for you so go to the end go to a beginning go by words go backwards delete another one I find myself using for movement a lot is ctrl D and control you so this is like allows me to move fast through the thing because it just moves me up by pages and down by pages so really helpful so I'll just hold ctrl and I'm tapping D and then I'll just keep holding ctrl and keep tapping you and that's it okay so okay going to the beginning going to D and yeah so this is really the crux of it if you get DS right I mean this is essentially 80% of what you need to do trying to think what else is useful for use of CI double use useful di WNYW so again you can notice the patterns right see it's change so constantly everywhere you'll see any set type of C stuff i dub you as a modifier so you just do c IW just changes the word you know di w deletes the word let me ask you what why i dub you does so real quick drop in the chat before i answer it what does y IW do if you said it Yanks the word great job so yank word okay because it's just yank just really means copy okay so i'm just gonna write that it just means a copy word copy word they just use yank in their terminology that's all it means so you know if i'm going here on a copy the word done now if i pasted it it pasted that word that's helpful okay another useful one is r this allows you to replace so for example if I want to replace T instead of hitting a to go in insert mode then hitting backspace and then typing in T what I can do is I can do ar e R T so are just kind of lets me do it on the fly now this is like more micro optimization you know I would not put this in the 80/20 so you know I'll call this like 80/20 and I'll put this in like fancy stuff alright you don't really need this but this is helpful this is just like optimization but really this is the this is all of that is ad part of the 80/20 right so you will put in 20% effort here and you'll get 80% results from these let me check on the chat what's going on Hudson says remember me what's up Hudson um can I do your course the profitable programmer 2.0 at my own pace yes you can you can do it at your own pace definitely it's yeah just if you want to go slow go slow when I go fast you can go fast just go at your own pace okay what else we got in here Tony to do nested loops it's not too complex just a test it just depends what you want to use them for but yeah the nested loops are they're fun they're fun okay let me think about what else can I offer in this that still is part of the 80/20 so that like I'm telling you the stuff that I use all right I'm telling you the stuff that I commonly use its exhaustive the amount of things you can learn but I don't recommend learning all of them just learn the stuff that you really need to get going okay so you got e you know B you got shift a you got shift I which you know practice that right now actually so shift I shifted just keep practicing it keep drilling like if you're on this live stream and you're hearing my voice just keep using that as like a drilling exercise because the more you practice this stuff the better you'll become if you use it like this weird tool and you give it so much respect you'll never learn it you'll get better at it in a really slow way just look to make mistakes look to really up and have fun all right so the more mistakes you make and the more you crash and burn stuff that's better you'll improve like that so shift a scape shift icescape shift a shift I escape shift a escape shift I cool EEE BBB BBB okay all right change this word oh crap didn't mean to do that hit scape hit you di w delete the word oh crap didn't mean to do that hit you shift I escape delete the line okay delete this line paste it underneath this one so DDP delete this paste it on top all right so that's another one that I'll show you which is cool P is like pasted on top okay and most things have a shift version of them so I believe redo is shift you I believe let me actually try that hello I guess not I don't know what it is it could be like sometimes I'm not even thinking about the things I'm typing I'm just my muscle memory is just builtin so I'll just do them without really ever thinking about it and if somebody's in the chat who knows about it you're a feel free to drop something that I may be missing or something that you use that's helpful so Carlos if you want to add something that'd be great ah module that's awesome man welcome yeah module used to go to our Chess Club yeah welcome welcome and yeah Python is awesome so definitely go and take advantage of things okay yeah if you guys will find a tutorial useful for how I actually made this app the todo list app and what I did I can definitely do that for you guys at some point for sure cool that's a that's what I wanted to share I think that takes care of a lot of what this is about let me see if I can fork this nope doesn't allow me to create a fork of it trying to create a fork and put it in the description ah 10 10 plus DD yep yep yep that's a good one that's a good one too for sure redo is controlr yep yep yep yep okay cool so redo is definitely important so let's add
