With timestamps:

00:00 - look i get it most of you are stuck in
00:02 - tutorial hell
00:04 - a lot of you can't seem to get yourself
00:07 - out of that
00:09 - this is something i was in for the
00:11 - longest time that i can imagine
00:13 - and it's one of those things that
00:15 - probably frustrated me
00:17 - and just straight up [ __ ] on my
00:19 - career from getting better
00:21 - for the longest amount of time because
00:24 - all i kept doing was going tutorial
00:25 - after tutorial and don't lie to me right
00:27 - now because i know
00:29 - you're probably doing that there's a
00:31 - high chance of you
00:32 - whether you're watching clever
00:33 - programmer tutorials and you're doing
00:35 - build after build
00:36 - or you're watching udemy or something
00:38 - else out there
00:39 - whatever it may be you are not making a
00:42 - lot of forward progress and what do i
00:44 - mean by forward progress
00:46 - what i mean when i say forward progress
00:48 - is really are you working on projects
00:51 - that excite you
00:52 - and are you working on stuff where it's
00:54 - useful to you and going on your
00:55 - portfolio
00:57 - are you working on things and are you
00:59 - able to code from scratch
01:01 - and build real world things because if
01:04 - you can't do that
01:06 - i mean to be honest you're kind of
01:08 - screwed
01:09 - right like you're not getting making
01:11 - forward um
01:13 - you're not gonna be making forward
01:14 - progress you're gonna be kind of just
01:15 - like stuck
01:17 - forever you know like if i was to show
01:19 - you on the screen it's kind of like um
01:22 - let me see if i can open this up
01:25 - boom so if i was to show you here you'd
01:27 - be just like
01:29 - running in and this is what most of the
01:31 - people who are
01:33 - coding right like you're just kind of
01:34 - running in circles forever
01:36 - and it seems like there's never any
01:39 - getting out of there
01:40 - going after tutorial after tutorial and
01:42 - what you want to be able to do
01:44 - is you want to preferably be able to go
01:47 - in a straight line where your career
01:51 - is moving forward like this but right
01:53 - now what's happening
01:54 - is you go to one tutorial make progress
01:57 - then you go to another one make
01:58 - some progress then go to another one and
02:00 - then maybe you even start picking up a
02:02 - new framework where in my opinion you're
02:03 - making backwards progress sometimes
02:05 - because
02:06 - if you want to get really really good
02:08 - you should just stick to one thing and
02:09 - keep getting better at it like for
02:10 - example in the start
02:12 - i personally don't think that you should
02:15 - be
02:15 - learning like basics of javascript and
02:18 - then moving on and trying to learn react
02:21 - and then trying to learn next js and
02:24 - trying to learn ever
02:25 - like all of these other things because
02:27 - instead of making forward progress
02:28 - really what you're doing is you're
02:30 - branching out
02:31 - you're make some forward progress with
02:32 - javascript then you start all over again
02:34 - make some forward progress with react
02:36 - then you start all over again make some
02:38 - forward progress with
02:41 - um you know what is it next js or
02:43 - tailwind css or whatever
02:45 - is your flavor of the month and you're
02:48 - not really making any forward progress
02:50 - at all
02:50 - in reality what you should be doing is
02:53 - pick up javascript
02:54 - and just start coding day one okay
02:58 - then this is day two code
03:01 - day two then if i keep going
03:04 - right this is day three
03:08 - and when i say you're coding i literally
03:10 - mean you are coding like
03:12 - yes you can watch tutorials yes you can
03:14 - try to pick up exercises but like
03:16 - code [ __ ] that you could do with
03:18 - whatever you do know for example if you
03:20 - learn if else
03:22 - make a freaking game out of if else you
03:24 - can take if else statements so far
03:27 - make something interactive where if you
03:29 - have a if else block i can type in
03:31 - something
03:32 - a pop-up happens and then i type in you
03:35 - know
03:36 - guess you can make guess the number game
03:37 - with fl statements right if i guess 50
03:39 - it goes too low
03:40 - then i guess uh 30 and then it goes too
03:43 - high then i guess 40 and then it's like
03:45 - close and then i'm
03:46 - like 42 and it goes correct you could do
03:49 - so much
03:50 - so then do that and you should be coding
03:52 - or thinking about coding or problem
03:54 - solving for many
03:55 - hours in a day so many of you have this
03:59 - crazy freaking problem with
04:02 - being able to sit there and think and
04:04 - focus for a long period of time
04:06 - if you cannot sit there think focus for
04:08 - a long period of time
04:10 - i'm not gonna say you're not gonna
04:11 - become a coder ever but like you're
04:13 - gonna have so
04:14 - much more difficulty right because for
04:15 - example if you are sitting there and you
04:18 - have trouble focusing
04:19 - you're making turtle like progress every
04:21 - day right so like for example this is
04:23 - you
04:24 - you make this much progress and that's
04:26 - all you got done in day one and then day
04:28 - two you make this much progress and
04:30 - that's all you got done in day two
04:32 - then you make this much progress that's
04:33 - your day three right and then you have a
04:35 - freak like me
04:37 - who will code there like a [ __ ]
04:39 - just not stop and i'll code for 10 12
04:41 - 14 hours and especially when i was
04:43 - picking it up as a skill
04:45 - i was literally coding 12 to 14 hours a
04:47 - day so then
04:48 - you have somebody who's not more
04:50 - talented than you who's not smarter than
04:52 - you because i failed my math classes i
04:53 - sucked at them
04:55 - but i will sit there and code for that
04:58 - amount of time and
04:59 - that's and that's my one day okay
05:03 - right and then and if we keep going
05:08 - this is my second day i've made this
05:10 - much progress on day two this is my day
05:12 - one and day two
05:14 - whereas like for you and most people
05:16 - you're gonna be here on day six
05:19 - right what i got done in in the in one
05:22 - day because with coding
05:25 - unlike let's say you're doing power
05:27 - lifting right with power lifting okay
05:29 - yeah if you dead lift and squat and
05:31 - bench
05:32 - if you did it for like more than two or
05:34 - three hours you'll start to have
05:35 - diminishing returns where you've broken
05:37 - down your muscles so much
05:38 - you literally need to give it more time
05:40 - to recover and heal
05:43 - with learning you can learn for 14 hours
05:46 - a day and then go to sleep
05:48 - let your brain process that and then
05:50 - wake up the next day and do that again
05:52 - with learning there's nothing that
05:54 - kind of messes you up or is in the way
05:58 - with um with uh when it comes to power
06:02 - lifting you need time for recovery
06:04 - because you're literally breaking down
06:05 - your muscles but learning you can just
06:06 - keep going okay
06:07 - so that's a huge advantage and you can
06:10 - do this
06:10 - for example where else can you do it
06:12 - okay when you're driving your car
06:15 - can you listen to a podcast about coding
06:20 - boom there's your extra learning time
06:22 - okay
06:24 - if you drive for one hour you're like
06:26 - hey i have a long commute great
06:27 - one to two hours a day one to two hours
06:31 - you are able to now um you're now able
06:35 - to learn coding
06:36 - okay or learn about coding which is
06:39 - super
06:39 - super important if there's other things
06:42 - you're like hey i am
06:44 - i i have to use the bathroom so i just
06:46 - need to kill that time
06:47 - if you're in the bathroom or you're
06:48 - showering or if you're not showering
06:50 - you're just
06:51 - freaking going um and pooping right
06:54 - you can watch a youtube video that's
06:56 - talking about code and maybe it's even
06:58 - interesting or maybe pick something that
07:00 - might excite you
07:02 - but you need to be doing things that
07:04 - constantly move you forward excite you
07:06 - brainwash you to want to code
07:09 - and makes you want to do things right
07:11 - most people
07:12 - first of all they'll only code very
07:14 - limited amounts of time
07:16 - and second of all they will never do
07:18 - their own learning
07:19 - like most people will just only do the
07:23 - learning
07:23 - that's prescribed to them through
07:27 - whatever their school tells them to do
07:29 - or whatever their
07:30 - youtube tutorial tells them to do or
07:32 - whatever their udemy tutorial tells you
07:34 - to do
07:34 - if you keep doing that here's what's
07:36 - going to happen and let me just make
07:37 - sure the audio is
07:40 - audio is good let's check the audio okay
07:42 - it's looking good there
07:43 - and let's check here beautiful so what's
07:46 - gonna happen when you do this
07:49 - is that you're you're just gonna be like
07:52 - stuck
07:52 - and you're just gonna be confused and
07:54 - you're not gonna make forward progress
07:55 - okay and also when you go to a job
07:57 - interview
07:58 - if you weren't able to turn things into
08:00 - your own and you weren't able to code
08:02 - something creatively
08:03 - and you go to a job interview and i tell
08:06 - you hey
08:07 - turn it into this you won't be able to
08:09 - do that you won't be able to make it
08:11 - something custom
08:12 - and you won't even be able to solve the
08:14 - problem they gave you
08:15 - because all you taught yourself how to
08:17 - do is to follow a tutorial
08:20 - so you got the skill of following
08:22 - tutorials but you did not
08:24 - work on your skill of thinking and you
08:26 - did not work on your skill of problem
08:29 - solving
08:31 - so you're not going to get the job
08:33 - you're just going to be stuck
08:36 - so this is why right this is so
08:39 - important
08:40 - like use all this time that you have
08:43 - at your disposal if you're washing
08:45 - dishes
08:48 - learn coding watch a video listen to
08:52 - something
08:54 - okay what else is there there's there's
08:56 - dishes
08:57 - uh driving there's tons of countless if
09:00 - you're cleaning the house
09:02 - you can be listening or watching
09:05 - something related to coding okay
09:08 - if you drive a truck all the time that's
09:10 - perfect for listening to audible
09:12 - listen to the story of how linus
09:14 - torvalds
09:16 - you know built linux listen to elon
09:18 - musk's
09:19 - autobiography listen to books that
09:21 - either personally develop
09:23 - you or make you interested in coding or
09:27 - straight up podcasts that talk about
09:29 - coding i know wes boss has a podcast
09:32 - called syntax
09:33 - and there's a bunch of other ones out
09:34 - there i don't care what you pick i just
09:36 - care
09:37 - you pick something and you learn and you
09:39 - keep improving your skill
09:42 - because at the end of the day it's about
09:44 - the hours that you actually put into
09:45 - this skill and that's all that comes
09:47 - down to
09:48 - if you're not putting if i have more
09:49 - hours like assuming our
09:51 - intelligence levels are equal so let's
09:53 - say that your intelligence level is here
09:55 - and my intelligence level is here okay
09:59 - um my bad i meant to make equal lines so
10:01 - these lines are fairly equal okay this
10:03 - is line one and this is two
10:04 - they're fairly equal well um
10:08 - we're both going to be pretty much at
10:10 - the same level
10:11 - right but now if you
10:15 - if we're same amount of talented but now
10:18 - if you're putting in
10:19 - two times the time as me to learn coding
10:22 - you have just 2x yourself
10:25 - okay now if you're brainwashing yourself
10:28 - and watching documentaries like instead
10:30 - of watching netflix at night in your
10:32 - wind down time maybe you're watching mr
10:34 - robot
10:34 - maybe you're watching a show like
10:36 - silicon valley that is entertaining
10:38 - funny
10:39 - but still hypes you up and excites you
10:42 - about coding and programming
10:43 - and you're kind of altering your reality
10:46 - to become that of a developer
10:48 - now instead of 2xing your results now
10:51 - you have four extra results
10:54 - okay and this this multiplier can keep
10:58 - increasing if you're taking care of your
11:00 - body and you're sleeping healthy and
11:02 - you're eating healthy
11:03 - and your body's clean and now when you
11:07 - code and learn coding your memory is
11:10 - stronger because you're able to retain
11:11 - more information you have less fogginess
11:13 - so
11:14 - you can absorb more information and
11:15 - actually apply more information
11:17 - now you've doubled maybe the result of
11:19 - the previous 4x multiplier
11:21 - and you've 8xed your results okay every
11:24 - time you add
11:25 - a new element you essentially double
11:27 - your results so one is for example
11:30 - maximizing your time right the other is
11:34 - kind of immersion which is like what i
11:36 - was calling like
11:37 - uh brainwashing yourself and then um
11:41 - i don't know what was the third one i
11:43 - forgot somebody in the chat will let me
11:45 - know but i'm not live so
11:47 - that won't help but whatever the third
11:49 - one was right that that
11:50 - is what gives you that multiplier each
11:54 - new thing that you do oh yeah body
11:58 - okay with each thing you do essentially
12:02 - is a new multiplier and
12:05 - gets you freaking jacked in your career
12:08 - and when we say 8x
12:10 - well 8x is massive because what 8x
12:12 - really means
12:14 - if we get out of this is you're going to
12:18 - achieve in one lifetime the results i
12:20 - will achieve in
12:20 - eight lifetimes you've 8xed your results
12:24 - you've eight extra career results you've
12:26 - also eight x
12:27 - shortened your results that you would
12:29 - get so for example let's say
12:31 - in your coding career the success you
12:33 - would achieve in 30 years
12:35 - well now you've 8xed it so just divide
12:37 - 30 by 8.
12:39 - so what's 30 by 8 30 where's my
12:43 - 30 divided by 8 that's 3.75
12:47 - 3.75 years so now you're getting 30
12:50 - years of results in
12:52 - 3.75 years which is kind of
12:55 - ridiculous when you put it like that
12:58 - but you're essentially getting
13:00 - incredible results so then people ask
13:02 - you hey how did you get that six-figure
13:03 - income so fast
13:05 - hey how are you able to build these real
13:07 - world applications and you were able to
13:09 - figure that out so fast
13:10 - that's how you have maximized your time
13:14 - you've maximized your body and you've
13:16 - maximized
13:17 - how much you believe in it the immersion
13:23 - if you start to now make friends this
13:25 - also goes towards immersion
13:27 - if you now go from friends who talk
13:29 - about gears of war or
13:30 - call of duty or league of legends or
13:34 - complain or negativity now if you
13:37 - replace
13:38 - that with friends who are cool friends
13:40 - and also talk about coding
13:44 - that's another multiplier that's part of
13:46 - the immersion multiplier
13:48 - now what you've done is you have friends
13:52 - that add value to your life
13:56 - and you have they fasten you to speed up
14:00 - your growth because
14:00 - as you're speaking with them yes you're
14:02 - having fun you're having a conversation
14:03 - but you're learning at the same freaking
14:05 - time
14:06 - so they're real-time tutorials that are
14:09 - teaching you
14:10 - okay but they're more practical even
14:12 - than tutorials
14:14 - okay because tutorials are great but
14:16 - they will not
14:18 - make you a better developer a lot of the
14:19 - times because you're just stick
14:21 - you're stuck there watching somebody
14:23 - else you will make progress when you do
14:25 - it
14:26 - so even when you watch tutorials i
14:27 - highly recommend you keep pausing them
14:29 - you keep building your own thing
14:30 - you keep switching it and changing it
14:33 - until that app is now yours
14:36 - completely yours completely unique or
14:38 - maybe you had a like if you
14:40 - somebody's building a blogging app you
14:43 - copy that and turn it into a video app
14:47 - okay that's how you win that's how you
14:49 - will win
14:50 - all right so these are some of the
14:52 - things i wanted to share with you
14:54 - maximize your time with coding don't go
14:58 - wow i have one hour a day two hours a
15:00 - day that's not gonna make you good you
15:01 - have to invest
15:02 - a lot of time if you have a family if
15:05 - you have kids which i know a lot of you
15:06 - do
15:07 - a lot of the students that are in our
15:08 - coding boot camp
15:10 - i know you hi if you're watching this
15:13 - archana hi if any of you are watching
15:16 - this
15:17 - hello brandon i understand you have
15:20 - families
15:21 - you have kids you have maybe even a job
15:24 - that takes up so much of your time
15:26 - whatever time is left over spend it into
15:29 - coding
15:30 - and during your time you can still be
15:32 - listening and learning about coding
15:34 - you can be literally watching my youtube
15:36 - videos and talk
15:37 - hearing me talk about coding and even if
15:40 - you're not seeing the screen
15:41 - even that might help just because you're
15:43 - getting familiar with the thought
15:44 - patterns
15:45 - what i'm saying the lingo
15:48 - it makes it less intimidating it has a
15:50 - huge impact
15:52 - so keep an eye out for that okay
15:55 - so that's all i have for you today okay
15:57 - if you enjoyed this video smash the like
15:59 - button
15:59 - subscribe to the goddamn channel because
16:01 - this is the channel where you learn
16:02 - everything react react
16:04 - react native and also full stack
16:05 - development and last thing i want to let
16:08 - you know
16:08 - is that for the cohort of june we're
16:10 - going to be shutting down enrollment for
16:12 - our full stack mastery boot camp
16:14 - in just a few days okay so for the june
16:17 - cohort it starts june 1st so in the next
16:19 - five to six days
16:20 - we're going to be shutting down
16:21 - enrollment for that so if this is
16:23 - something
16:24 - if you want to learn with me and my team
16:27 - and you want to be in our immersive
16:28 - coding boot camp that we just recently
16:30 - launched
16:31 - it's an incredible boot camp and i mean
16:34 - we just dive deep in this boot camp so
16:36 - just a couple of things that
16:37 - you should know it's uh six to eight
16:39 - months long right now we're
16:41 - we are making it even eight months
16:42 - because other boot camps they just don't
16:45 - do you justice like in two to three
16:47 - months you're not going to become a
16:48 - great developer i'm sorry but that's
16:49 - just
16:50 - the truth of it okay the only people
16:52 - that become successful out of those boot
16:53 - camps are people who already know coding
16:55 - so this bootcamp is mainly for people
16:58 - who are looking to switch careers
17:00 - or complete beginners and like looking
17:02 - to learn all of the skills if you're
17:03 - more
17:04 - advanced you will still get your ass
17:05 - kicked and learn a ton of things okay
17:07 - so you're going to learn data structures
17:09 - and algorithms we're going to
17:10 - teach you all the front end back end
17:13 - you're going to learn everything
17:14 - okay so if this is something exciting to
17:16 - you and you want to speak with me or my
17:18 - team members about
17:20 - schedule a call with us okay in the link
17:22 - below i'll have the
17:23 - you know there's a form fill that out in
17:25 - as much detail as possible
17:27 - currently we're mostly working with u.s
17:29 - students okay so if you're us
17:31 - go ahead and apply and fill out the
17:35 - details
17:36 - because we are very selective about the
17:38 - students that we take so we can only
17:40 - take a couple of students at a time
17:42 - so please fill in on as much detail as
17:44 - possible so then that gives you a chance
17:45 - for
17:46 - for me to pick up and get on a call with
17:47 - you or one of my team members to get on
17:49 - a call with you
17:50 - and then we'll just let you know i'm
17:51 - gonna be honest with you okay we're
17:52 - gonna be honest with you if it's a good
17:53 - fit for you we're gonna let you know if
17:55 - it's not a good fit for you i
17:56 - will tell you hey self teaching is
17:58 - better for you so save your money
18:00 - um hey this other bootcamp might be
18:02 - better for you we will just be honest
18:04 - with you okay my number one goal is that
18:05 - you actually get a job you actually
18:07 - increase your skills my number one goal
18:08 - is not to take your money i don't care
18:10 - i want to see you succeed i love your
18:12 - beautiful face this is qazi
18:14 - as always i'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

look i get it most of you are stuck in tutorial hell a lot of you can't seem to get yourself out of that this is something i was in for the longest time that i can imagine and it's one of those things that probably frustrated me and just straight up [ __ ] on my career from getting better for the longest amount of time because all i kept doing was going tutorial after tutorial and don't lie to me right now because i know you're probably doing that there's a high chance of you whether you're watching clever programmer tutorials and you're doing build after build or you're watching udemy or something else out there whatever it may be you are not making a lot of forward progress and what do i mean by forward progress what i mean when i say forward progress is really are you working on projects that excite you and are you working on stuff where it's useful to you and going on your portfolio are you working on things and are you able to code from scratch and build real world things because if you can't do that i mean to be honest you're kind of screwed right like you're not getting making forward um you're not gonna be making forward progress you're gonna be kind of just like stuck forever you know like if i was to show you on the screen it's kind of like um let me see if i can open this up boom so if i was to show you here you'd be just like running in and this is what most of the people who are coding right like you're just kind of running in circles forever and it seems like there's never any getting out of there going after tutorial after tutorial and what you want to be able to do is you want to preferably be able to go in a straight line where your career is moving forward like this but right now what's happening is you go to one tutorial make progress then you go to another one make some progress then go to another one and then maybe you even start picking up a new framework where in my opinion you're making backwards progress sometimes because if you want to get really really good you should just stick to one thing and keep getting better at it like for example in the start i personally don't think that you should be learning like basics of javascript and then moving on and trying to learn react and then trying to learn next js and trying to learn ever like all of these other things because instead of making forward progress really what you're doing is you're branching out you're make some forward progress with javascript then you start all over again make some forward progress with react then you start all over again make some forward progress with um you know what is it next js or tailwind css or whatever is your flavor of the month and you're not really making any forward progress at all in reality what you should be doing is pick up javascript and just start coding day one okay then this is day two code day two then if i keep going right this is day three and when i say you're coding i literally mean you are coding like yes you can watch tutorials yes you can try to pick up exercises but like code [ __ ] that you could do with whatever you do know for example if you learn if else make a freaking game out of if else you can take if else statements so far make something interactive where if you have a if else block i can type in something a popup happens and then i type in you know guess you can make guess the number game with fl statements right if i guess 50 it goes too low then i guess uh 30 and then it goes too high then i guess 40 and then it's like close and then i'm like 42 and it goes correct you could do so much so then do that and you should be coding or thinking about coding or problem solving for many hours in a day so many of you have this crazy freaking problem with being able to sit there and think and focus for a long period of time if you cannot sit there think focus for a long period of time i'm not gonna say you're not gonna become a coder ever but like you're gonna have so much more difficulty right because for example if you are sitting there and you have trouble focusing you're making turtle like progress every day right so like for example this is you you make this much progress and that's all you got done in day one and then day two you make this much progress and that's all you got done in day two then you make this much progress that's your day three right and then you have a freak like me who will code there like a [ __ ] just not stop and i'll code for 10 12 14 hours and especially when i was picking it up as a skill i was literally coding 12 to 14 hours a day so then you have somebody who's not more talented than you who's not smarter than you because i failed my math classes i sucked at them but i will sit there and code for that amount of time and that's and that's my one day okay right and then and if we keep going this is my second day i've made this much progress on day two this is my day one and day two whereas like for you and most people you're gonna be here on day six right what i got done in in the in one day because with coding unlike let's say you're doing power lifting right with power lifting okay yeah if you dead lift and squat and bench if you did it for like more than two or three hours you'll start to have diminishing returns where you've broken down your muscles so much you literally need to give it more time to recover and heal with learning you can learn for 14 hours a day and then go to sleep let your brain process that and then wake up the next day and do that again with learning there's nothing that kind of messes you up or is in the way with um with uh when it comes to power lifting you need time for recovery because you're literally breaking down your muscles but learning you can just keep going okay so that's a huge advantage and you can do this for example where else can you do it okay when you're driving your car can you listen to a podcast about coding boom there's your extra learning time okay if you drive for one hour you're like hey i have a long commute great one to two hours a day one to two hours you are able to now um you're now able to learn coding okay or learn about coding which is super super important if there's other things you're like hey i am i i have to use the bathroom so i just need to kill that time if you're in the bathroom or you're showering or if you're not showering you're just freaking going um and pooping right you can watch a youtube video that's talking about code and maybe it's even interesting or maybe pick something that might excite you but you need to be doing things that constantly move you forward excite you brainwash you to want to code and makes you want to do things right most people first of all they'll only code very limited amounts of time and second of all they will never do their own learning like most people will just only do the learning that's prescribed to them through whatever their school tells them to do or whatever their youtube tutorial tells them to do or whatever their udemy tutorial tells you to do if you keep doing that here's what's going to happen and let me just make sure the audio is audio is good let's check the audio okay it's looking good there and let's check here beautiful so what's gonna happen when you do this is that you're you're just gonna be like stuck and you're just gonna be confused and you're not gonna make forward progress okay and also when you go to a job interview if you weren't able to turn things into your own and you weren't able to code something creatively and you go to a job interview and i tell you hey turn it into this you won't be able to do that you won't be able to make it something custom and you won't even be able to solve the problem they gave you because all you taught yourself how to do is to follow a tutorial so you got the skill of following tutorials but you did not work on your skill of thinking and you did not work on your skill of problem solving so you're not going to get the job you're just going to be stuck so this is why right this is so important like use all this time that you have at your disposal if you're washing dishes learn coding watch a video listen to something okay what else is there there's there's dishes uh driving there's tons of countless if you're cleaning the house you can be listening or watching something related to coding okay if you drive a truck all the time that's perfect for listening to audible listen to the story of how linus torvalds you know built linux listen to elon musk's autobiography listen to books that either personally develop you or make you interested in coding or straight up podcasts that talk about coding i know wes boss has a podcast called syntax and there's a bunch of other ones out there i don't care what you pick i just care you pick something and you learn and you keep improving your skill because at the end of the day it's about the hours that you actually put into this skill and that's all that comes down to if you're not putting if i have more hours like assuming our intelligence levels are equal so let's say that your intelligence level is here and my intelligence level is here okay um my bad i meant to make equal lines so these lines are fairly equal okay this is line one and this is two they're fairly equal well um we're both going to be pretty much at the same level right but now if you if we're same amount of talented but now if you're putting in two times the time as me to learn coding you have just 2x yourself okay now if you're brainwashing yourself and watching documentaries like instead of watching netflix at night in your wind down time maybe you're watching mr robot maybe you're watching a show like silicon valley that is entertaining funny but still hypes you up and excites you about coding and programming and you're kind of altering your reality to become that of a developer now instead of 2xing your results now you have four extra results okay and this this multiplier can keep increasing if you're taking care of your body and you're sleeping healthy and you're eating healthy and your body's clean and now when you code and learn coding your memory is stronger because you're able to retain more information you have less fogginess so you can absorb more information and actually apply more information now you've doubled maybe the result of the previous 4x multiplier and you've 8xed your results okay every time you add a new element you essentially double your results so one is for example maximizing your time right the other is kind of immersion which is like what i was calling like uh brainwashing yourself and then um i don't know what was the third one i forgot somebody in the chat will let me know but i'm not live so that won't help but whatever the third one was right that that is what gives you that multiplier each new thing that you do oh yeah body okay with each thing you do essentially is a new multiplier and gets you freaking jacked in your career and when we say 8x well 8x is massive because what 8x really means if we get out of this is you're going to achieve in one lifetime the results i will achieve in eight lifetimes you've 8xed your results you've eight extra career results you've also eight x shortened your results that you would get so for example let's say in your coding career the success you would achieve in 30 years well now you've 8xed it so just divide 30 by 8. so what's 30 by 8 30 where's my 30 divided by 8 that's 3.75 3.75 years so now you're getting 30 years of results in 3.75 years which is kind of ridiculous when you put it like that but you're essentially getting incredible results so then people ask you hey how did you get that sixfigure income so fast hey how are you able to build these real world applications and you were able to figure that out so fast that's how you have maximized your time you've maximized your body and you've maximized how much you believe in it the immersion if you start to now make friends this also goes towards immersion if you now go from friends who talk about gears of war or call of duty or league of legends or complain or negativity now if you replace that with friends who are cool friends and also talk about coding that's another multiplier that's part of the immersion multiplier now what you've done is you have friends that add value to your life and you have they fasten you to speed up your growth because as you're speaking with them yes you're having fun you're having a conversation but you're learning at the same freaking time so they're realtime tutorials that are teaching you okay but they're more practical even than tutorials okay because tutorials are great but they will not make you a better developer a lot of the times because you're just stick you're stuck there watching somebody else you will make progress when you do it so even when you watch tutorials i highly recommend you keep pausing them you keep building your own thing you keep switching it and changing it until that app is now yours completely yours completely unique or maybe you had a like if you somebody's building a blogging app you copy that and turn it into a video app okay that's how you win that's how you will win all right so these are some of the things i wanted to share with you maximize your time with coding don't go wow i have one hour a day two hours a day that's not gonna make you good you have to invest a lot of time if you have a family if you have kids which i know a lot of you do a lot of the students that are in our coding boot camp i know you hi if you're watching this archana hi if any of you are watching this hello brandon i understand you have families you have kids you have maybe even a job that takes up so much of your time whatever time is left over spend it into coding and during your time you can still be listening and learning about coding you can be literally watching my youtube videos and talk hearing me talk about coding and even if you're not seeing the screen even that might help just because you're getting familiar with the thought patterns what i'm saying the lingo it makes it less intimidating it has a huge impact so keep an eye out for that okay so that's all i have for you today okay if you enjoyed this video smash the like button subscribe to the goddamn channel because this is the channel where you learn everything react react react native and also full stack development and last thing i want to let you know is that for the cohort of june we're going to be shutting down enrollment for our full stack mastery boot camp in just a few days okay so for the june cohort it starts june 1st so in the next five to six days we're going to be shutting down enrollment for that so if this is something if you want to learn with me and my team and you want to be in our immersive coding boot camp that we just recently launched it's an incredible boot camp and i mean we just dive deep in this boot camp so just a couple of things that you should know it's uh six to eight months long right now we're we are making it even eight months because other boot camps they just don't do you justice like in two to three months you're not going to become a great developer i'm sorry but that's just the truth of it okay the only people that become successful out of those boot camps are people who already know coding so this bootcamp is mainly for people who are looking to switch careers or complete beginners and like looking to learn all of the skills if you're more advanced you will still get your ass kicked and learn a ton of things okay so you're going to learn data structures and algorithms we're going to teach you all the front end back end you're going to learn everything okay so if this is something exciting to you and you want to speak with me or my team members about schedule a call with us okay in the link below i'll have the you know there's a form fill that out in as much detail as possible currently we're mostly working with u.s students okay so if you're us go ahead and apply and fill out the details because we are very selective about the students that we take so we can only take a couple of students at a time so please fill in on as much detail as possible so then that gives you a chance for for me to pick up and get on a call with you or one of my team members to get on a call with you and then we'll just let you know i'm gonna be honest with you okay we're gonna be honest with you if it's a good fit for you we're gonna let you know if it's not a good fit for you i will tell you hey self teaching is better for you so save your money um hey this other bootcamp might be better for you we will just be honest with you okay my number one goal is that you actually get a job you actually increase your skills my number one goal is not to take your money i don't care i want to see you succeed i love your beautiful face this is qazi as always i'll see you in the next video
