02:16 - with like pretty much everything like
02:18 - clever programmer a lot of the reason
02:19 - that actually exists

02:36 - thick and thin
02:37 - and like helped us really bring it back
02:39 - and then like propel
02:41 - clever programmer to another level and
02:43 - if i didn't have that sanity and that
02:45 - voice of reason
02:46 - at that time guys a lot of this today
02:49 - would not exist so
02:51 - i'm i'm really personally just pumped to

02:58 - have her
02:59 - and hear her out one thing i want to say
03:01 - is that

03:04 - value bombs in this presentation that
03:06 - rachel has prepared for you guys
03:08 - so just make sure that you have a
03:10 - notebook you're ready to pay attention

03:26 - it
03:26 - as easy for you as possible but just
03:29 - remember you're going to be getting
03:30 - a lot of value out of this freelance
03:32 - developer
03:33 - guide that we have put together and
03:34 - again it's from somebody who
03:36 - has been doing freelancing and honestly
03:39 - for doing it over a period of three and
03:41 - a half years and somebody who's made
03:43 - well over fifty thousand dollars and
03:46 - almost kind of like working
03:47 - part-time and having our own lifestyle
03:50 - and you're a mother of
03:51 - two kids right yep two kids one baby one
03:55 - one five-year-old yeah and
03:59 - what's amazing about you rachel is most
04:02 - of the times i thought when you have
04:03 - kids you can't really do anything in
04:05 - life but
04:06 - you are somebody who has kids but then
04:09 - you're also super high performing
04:11 - and you're very critical thinking and
04:13 - then you're also doing so much growth
04:15 - with
04:15 - you're finding waste time to read books
04:19 - right like you're finding time to
04:21 - actually grow and self-reflect
04:23 - and improve and add value to the
04:25 - business as well
04:27 - yeah absolutely i think if anything kind
04:29 - of having kids has done the opposite for
04:30 - me
04:31 - in that it's like i really treasure that
04:33 - any time that i can
04:34 - put into personal growth i go all in on
04:36 - it um and i have to be super productive
04:38 - and high performing with with my work
04:40 - time
04:41 - plus it gives you that big big incentive
04:44 - obviously to like
04:45 - perform the best you can for them as
04:46 - well as yourself yeah
04:48 - i mean that's really amazing i don't see
04:50 - that with many other people honestly but
04:53 - it's really cool to see that with you
04:55 - and it's kind of inspiring it's like
04:57 - hey life doesn't just end when you have
04:59 - kids it actually can
05:00 - help propel you forward okay with that
05:04 - said
05:05 - let's jump right into it so freelance
05:08 - developer guy

05:21 - the next slide and then you can take it
05:22 - from here okay
05:24 - hey guys so um yeah first up the most
05:28 - crucial thing i think when you're
05:29 - starting as a freelancer especially is
05:31 - mindset
05:32 - getting your mind in the right place now
05:33 - i've tagged this up because um
05:35 - sunny and frankie did an epic video like
05:38 - back last week
05:39 - and there's a big section in that
05:40 - especially on mindset that speaks to a
05:42 - lot of um
05:43 - a lot of things that you'll find really
05:44 - useful but just getting your mind
05:47 - in the right place and having that
05:49 - attitude before you begin
05:50 - is it's crucial um
05:57 - and there are there are loads of things
05:58 - you can do though that will help you
06:00 - with that and
06:00 - yeah when if you could check that video
06:02 - out um yeah there are
06:04 - some really great tips yeah you're
06:06 - talking about the video with frankie
06:08 - and sonny yeah guys like that's a great
06:09 - video on mindset and yeah i think
06:12 - that's what you're referring to right
06:13 - that video yeah yeah that's the one
06:16 - yeah awesome we have some nice comments
06:19 - coming in people are like rachel is such
06:21 - an amazing human being
06:23 - uh yes we want to hear from rachel
06:26 - uh people are amanat is like we got
06:28 - rachel in the house
06:30 - yusuf says yeah rage in the house rocket
06:32 - girl
06:35 - yeah this is like this is special right
06:37 - now this is special because
06:39 - i mean i'm honestly i'm the i'm one of
06:42 - the biggest fans of just you
06:43 - as a human being so i i'm just pumped
06:47 - that
06:48 - we're actually on here and have the time
06:50 - to actually talk
06:51 - but it's kind of like disguised as we're
06:53 - creating content but it's also providing
06:54 - value to everybody you know so that's
06:56 - kind of fun
06:58 - i love it i love it okay so
07:02 - with the have an end goal in mind now
07:04 - what do you think about this
07:06 - you know with the skills and then making
07:08 - an income and are you able to see my
07:09 - screen right
07:11 - yes yeah okay i can see your screen yeah
07:13 - i think
07:14 - um i think that yeah that end goal is so
07:17 - so crucial in setting up the vision for
07:20 - what you want to create when you start
07:21 - freelancing
07:22 - so um be that a financial goal um
07:25 - that you can then reverse engineer um
07:28 - maybe you want to leave
07:29 - maybe you want to leave a nine-to-five
07:31 - job or move to freelancing
07:33 - maybe it's that you want to switch to a
07:35 - junior developer job
07:37 - whatever that might you know whatever
07:38 - that might be yep
07:40 - freelancing um just having an end goal
07:44 - that you're clear on and you can really
07:46 - keep
07:47 - in the back of your mind um and break
07:49 - down into the skills that you want to
07:50 - learn
07:51 - how you're going to earn that money yeah
07:54 - and then how you're going to go about
07:56 - getting the clients you know yep
07:58 - agreed agreed so that's great
08:01 - and now speak to us a little bit about
08:04 - on the salaries that developers
08:06 - can be making you know whether it's a
08:08 - front-end developer
08:09 - or back-end developer
08:13 - excuse me sorry i'm just gonna drink
08:16 - oh good
08:20 - like guys these are no joke salaries
08:23 - that most developers you know whether
08:25 - you're
08:26 - depending on whatever level you're at
08:28 - and for you to be able to make this much
08:30 - that is really powerful and most of
08:32 - these you can actually do it from
08:34 - different
08:34 - parts of the world right rachel yep yeah
08:37 - absolutely
08:38 - absolutely and that's that's the beauty
08:40 - of being able to work remotely too
08:43 - yep awesome so here we're looking at 99
08:46 - 000
08:47 - potential salary for a front-end
08:48 - developer and then
08:50 - what is it looking like for a back-end
08:52 - developer
08:54 - so back-end developer right up there
08:56 - with the 121-443
08:59 - dang that's a big number that's a big
09:02 - number
09:03 - yeah and you know if you whether you
09:05 - want to be a back-end developer
09:07 - front-end developer you can be making a
09:09 - lot of salary again it depends on your
09:11 - skill set
09:12 - and like you know rachel said in the
09:13 - start disclaimer hard work required
09:16 - so you can't just do it kind of out of
09:18 - nowhere you do have to put in the work
09:20 - and of course if you're a full stack
09:22 - developer you can be looking in a
09:24 - similar range
09:25 - as well okay i'm going to move on
09:30 - go ahead rachel okay so um
09:34 - just looking now more specifically at
09:36 - how you how you go about getting clients
09:38 - and setting yourself up with a strategy
09:40 - um so especially for me when i
09:43 - first started freelancing and i was
09:45 - still in the 95 situation the first
09:47 - thing i did
09:48 - set up your defense so you want that
09:50 - really clear online
09:52 - presence um that people can see when you
09:54 - start interacting
09:56 - um and you start hanging out networking
09:58 - online and looking for work
10:00 - so be that um social media platforms
10:03 - upwork um if you could hop onto the next
10:06 - one kazi
10:07 - um i i want to actually add on to what
10:10 - you're saying here
10:11 - uh rachel is and i'm sorry i'm cutting
10:15 - you off just a little bit but
10:16 - no it's grand i remember that even when
10:19 - you started working with clever
10:20 - programmer
10:21 - and you the initial interview took place
10:24 - from upwork
10:25 - uh we got on a call and you crushed it
10:28 - during the interview process i was
10:29 - asking you so many like questions
10:31 - it's like hey how would you you know if
10:32 - you have to create an email marketing
10:34 - sequence and tag it
10:35 - and you were able to answer all
10:37 - questions technically and i was i
10:38 - remember once i got off the call i was
10:40 - so excited
10:42 - but one thing that i did do that really
10:45 - sealed the deal for
10:46 - me is i found your facebook profile
10:49 - and then i was going through your
10:50 - facebook profile and even though you
10:52 - weren't getting
10:53 - like thousands of likes or thousands of
10:54 - shares like it didn't matter
10:56 - your facebook i went through your
10:58 - facebook profile and i would see you
10:59 - posting stuff that would literally have
11:01 - zero likes and zero comments sometimes
11:02 - and it would be like
11:04 - hey going into the rabbit hole of
11:05 - learning about you know convertkit
11:08 - or going into the rabbit hole of
11:10 - learning about like some other
11:11 - technology or something
11:13 - and i thought man this is the person we
11:15 - want
11:16 - who is so excited about it is that in
11:18 - their free time
11:20 - they're sharing these resources on their
11:21 - social media profile
11:23 - that was a huge thing for us
11:27 - when like at least for me mentally for
11:29 - me to decide actually even working with
11:31 - you and i think that could be useful for
11:32 - you guys for watching this
11:34 - you can build out your social media
11:36 - profiles even if they're not getting
11:38 - that many views because a job employer
11:41 - might actually look at it and see where
11:43 - your passions are right rachel
11:45 - yeah absolutely i remember that really
11:47 - well and it doesn't
11:49 - you don't even have to over complicate i
11:50 - think it was just a couple of simple
11:52 - posts
11:53 - i mean you can put graphics together in
11:54 - things like canva yeah
11:56 - um so it's so simple to set that up um i
11:59 - remember remember when you're talking
12:00 - about i think it was a wordpress theme
12:01 - salient that you built one of your
12:03 - websites on yeah yeah
12:06 - um but yeah that's it and it just just
12:08 - gives you that little corner of the
12:09 - internet where somebody can go and just
12:10 - get an impression of you what you're
12:12 - enthusiastic about
12:13 - um it gives them an insight into your
12:15 - technical skills without you having to
12:17 - say it it's just that the proof is there
12:19 - yeah it's it's the proof for sure
12:21 - so what are we looking at here okay
12:24 - so i think there's just a few simple
12:26 - things with that social media presence
12:28 - um that can really set you up for
12:30 - success um
12:32 - one thing i'd say is obviously
12:33 - prioritize the platforms that you
12:35 - actually enjoy spending time on
12:36 - so yeah if you're heavy on facebook or
12:39 - there are
12:40 - groups in facebook that there might be
12:41 - potential clients then
12:43 - make sure that you set that profile up
12:45 - um
12:47 - so it's easy to reach out to you um to
12:49 - find out how to work with you
12:51 - to see what your skills are and get a
12:53 - really quick simple idea of you
12:54 - um because you never know when
12:56 - somebody's looking you could be
12:57 - networking in a group and
12:59 - somebody just want to click on your
13:00 - little stalk
13:03 - and you want to make sure that platform
13:04 - is there um also what i find really good
13:06 - is to just keep
13:07 - certain things consistent if you've got
13:09 - different
13:10 - different different profiles things like
13:12 - a headshot so
13:14 - if you're using a headshot um
13:18 - and yeah talk with headshots
13:20 - specifically i think that's something
13:21 - that's really worth putting a little bit
13:22 - of time into to make sure you've got a
13:24 - good picture of your face so people can
13:25 - really
13:27 - so people can and a nice smile yeah
13:30 - yeah because people will make that
13:32 - decision sometimes within a few seconds
13:34 - yep we just got our first donation
13:37 - actually
13:38 - thank you so much gaming with wizard
13:42 - and uh we're gonna take your questions
13:44 - later but he says hey i'm not getting
13:45 - clients
13:46 - give me a suggestion and that's what
13:48 - we're going to do in this video okay so
13:49 - keep watching
13:50 - and we're going to give you tons of
13:52 - suggestions and ideas
13:55 - so keeping profile headshots and things
13:57 - like that consistent across
13:59 - and also making sure that they're good
14:01 - right like smiling i think is really
14:03 - happy
14:04 - really important because when people
14:05 - look sad or depressed
14:07 - i don't want to work with them you know
14:09 - you don't want to work with you because
14:10 - you're like either this person is going
14:11 - to be condescending
14:13 - or they're going to be patronizing or
14:15 - there's going to be something weird
14:16 - about this person
14:17 - i don't want to work with them but
14:18 - having like i'm not
14:20 - yeah it's crazy how much that smile
14:22 - actually
14:23 - how long of a wait goes so if you guys
14:26 - are watching this
14:28 - literally it can make the difference
14:29 - between eighty thousand dollars being in
14:31 - your bank account in one or two years
14:34 - versus five thousand dollars being in
14:36 - your bank account
14:38 - you know it's like it's crazy it's not
14:41 - just a smile but like it
14:42 - has that much of an impact sometimes
14:46 - you know i took a great photo of my
14:48 - friend tenzin
14:49 - and he ended up getting a client and i'm
14:52 - not gonna reveal their name but he got a
14:53 - client that were they were billionaires
14:58 - they were literally billionaires uh so
15:00 - he would be able to go and hang out with
15:02 - them and they would just pay him like
15:04 - five thousand
15:04 - four thousand to five thousand a week
15:07 - for literally just hanging
15:08 - out with them and that was his social
15:12 - media presence it was the photo it was
15:14 - the words that he had there
15:16 - it just can't be emphasized enough
15:20 - yeah so true so true and you just set it
15:22 - up once you've done it once and you've
15:23 - put the investment in then it's just
15:24 - there serving you
15:26 - nice people love smiling logan says
15:30 - a smile resembles happy energy you want
15:32 - to work with happy people
15:34 - getting some comments and from people
15:35 - that i'm reading out loud that maybe you
15:37 - don't see right now um
15:41 - awesome now here is somebody who we know
15:44 - who is this rachel
15:46 - here is amanath as a shiny example of
15:51 - a beautiful social media feed and
15:53 - especially i mean
15:54 - ours has been a student of ours for a
15:55 - few months now um and we've just seen
15:58 - him progress
15:59 - um and he's a machine with his social
16:02 - media
16:04 - yeah i mean he is even actually you know
16:07 - sunny is paying him to also manage his
16:09 - social media
16:11 - wow yeah and i'm thinking about hiring
16:13 - him actually
16:14 - um yeah and he came he came to our
16:17 - attention largely through instagram
16:18 - so it goes a long way doesn't it such a
16:21 - long way
16:22 - it's huge yeah big um i mean and
16:26 - his social media profile is so good that
16:28 - if you're an employer
16:30 - and he's interviewing and you're looking
16:32 - at it i mean that will be
16:34 - you will very likely hire him honestly
16:37 - because you will go
16:39 - like this is actually even more powerful
16:41 - than a resume in some ways right because
16:43 - you can't lie on this you know what i
16:46 - mean like
16:47 - he's been posting something for what
16:50 - over
16:50 - you know the last 10 20 30 40 50 days
16:55 - you know because on resume i can lie and
16:57 - say all kinds of crazy claims but this
16:59 - is like who
17:00 - i am and how i think on a daily basis
17:03 - man yeah that's so true because the
17:04 - consistency just speaks for itself
17:06 - doesn't it um
17:07 - i mean the content is there you can see
17:08 - the attention to detail you can see so
17:10 - many things about that person just from
17:11 - a look at their social media feed yep
17:14 - seriously he's actually in the chat
17:16 - right now and he's like
17:17 - oh thank you yeah
17:20 - yeah so guys actually go check out his
17:23 - profile and even check out his copy like
17:25 - let me actually see if i can
17:28 - find amanoth's instagram and pull it up
17:31 - here
17:32 - so let me see if i can find it but
17:36 - that is a huge let me see um
17:40 - yep there we go so i think we found it
17:43 - and i just shared it with everybody but
17:45 - if you guys take a look
17:46 - at the stuff that he's posting and you
17:48 - even read his copy
17:50 - right i can tell what type of person he
17:52 - is we keep moving forward opening new
17:55 - doors and open
17:56 - doing new things because we're curious
17:57 - and curiosity keeps leading us down new
17:59 - paths
18:00 - walt disney day six a day 36 out of 37
18:05 - and then he goes hey guys just wanted to
18:06 - share some knowledge on git
18:08 - git was developed by linus tor walls
18:09 - blah blah blah he goes on
18:12 - now if i am hiring this person i'm
18:16 - literally thinking man this person
18:19 - will change the culture
18:23 - in our business like
18:26 - if i have other software developers
18:28 - there he will boost their productivity
18:31 - so a software developer that you know
18:34 - let's say he's doing his 5x
18:36 - but then with the monoth on the team
18:38 - that developer will go from 5x to like
18:40 - 10x
18:43 - so yeah absolutely just brings so much
18:45 - energy right yeah so as a ceo or as an
18:47 - owner like a business owner i'm
18:48 - constantly will be thinking about how
18:50 - he will like the roi is like so there in
18:53 - my mind the value is so there and i want
18:56 - a person like this who when they learn
18:58 - they're hungry then share that knowledge
19:00 - with everybody around them
19:02 - so of course i will look at his resume
19:04 - of course i will take a look at his
19:05 - skills
19:06 - but this would just give him such a huge
19:08 - plus in my opinion
19:10 - yeah yeah absolutely that's it i think
19:12 - if he's connecting with people on
19:14 - instagram directly as well
19:16 - yeah then you know you never know who's
19:18 - seeing those posts
19:19 - um if he's out reaching out to people
19:22 - directly
19:22 - they're just going to take a quick look
19:23 - at this profile and wow yup
19:26 - really says so much it it really really
19:29 - does
19:30 - so okay i'm gonna so go ahead what's
19:33 - going on here
19:36 - okay so this was just um a quick check
19:38 - for setting up
19:39 - those profiles and making it super easy
19:42 - for people to actually
19:43 - they've checked you out they think yep i
19:45 - really want to take the next step with
19:47 - this person i want to book a call i want
19:48 - to work with them
19:49 - just make it as easy as possible so on
19:51 - facebook you've got things like the book
19:52 - now button
19:54 - um they'll link right through to your
19:56 - calendar
19:57 - if you've got a portfolio you obviously
19:58 - want to make that sure that's in there i
19:59 - mean these sound like basic things
20:02 - but so often you don't see them um and
20:05 - that means that they've gone on to the
20:06 - next person
20:06 - you know yep i see i see a
20:10 - multiple things here i see your new
20:12 - website is live
20:16 - and you've pinned it right yep i see
20:19 - that you even have
20:20 - a book me here so i can actually be able
20:22 - to book a call with you
20:24 - that's important um
20:27 - yep this is this is really valuable okay
20:31 - that's it right and that's what people
20:32 - will see when they click straight
20:33 - through from
20:34 - your personal profile yeah so you want
20:37 - to just make it as easy and frictionless
20:39 - as possible
20:40 - yep so got a comment here by
20:43 - sachin and he says seriously i find this
20:46 - totally not required
20:49 - and it's funny because he's misspelling
20:51 - the whole thing the whole time so
20:53 - i'll read it in his words seriously i
20:56 - find this
20:56 - tota totally not required it's
20:58 - misspelled
21:00 - beatifying your insta so that clients
21:02 - will think about you
21:03 - social life is supposed to be private
21:05 - and up to that person to share it with
21:06 - others
21:08 - now that's a pretty valid point
21:11 - but i think such and you're missing a
21:13 - very big point here and guys
21:14 - let me know what you guys think in the
21:16 - comments below as well because we are
21:17 - reading
21:18 - uh all of what you guys are saying as
21:20 - well but here's what i will say
21:23 - you could if you want to just make your
21:24 - social media profile completely private
21:26 - that's okay that's up to you
21:28 - but if you want to actually leverage it
21:30 - to grow your business and grow your
21:32 - brand
21:33 - and be able to get a higher paying
21:35 - salary which affects your personal life
21:37 - right like the fact that rachel can use
21:39 - her social media profile
21:41 - and then is able to generate an income
21:44 - with it
21:44 - she can provide for her family she
21:47 - doesn't have to worry about a ton of
21:49 - things like what happens if somebody
21:50 - around
21:51 - me like loses my job she doesn't have to
21:53 - worry about that so
21:54 - it actually has a huge impact on your
21:56 - life so you can see it as
21:58 - two different ways i see it as
22:01 - why not if you have the option to
22:03 - leverage it if you have the option to be
22:06 - able to
22:07 - use it to kind of further your life why
22:10 - would you not and
22:10 - and what are your thoughts on this
22:12 - rachel yeah i totally agree and i think
22:15 - i mean
22:16 - there's also the option of course if you
22:17 - did want to kind of have a private um
22:20 - a private life you could have you could
22:22 - set up a dedicated page
22:23 - especially with something like instagram
22:25 - yes um if it was privacy it was the
22:27 - question
22:28 - if that was the question then you could
22:29 - have a dedicated page where you didn't
22:31 - share your private life as much but you
22:33 - could still put the work in and share
22:34 - that handle
22:35 - yeah um i think that's an option also
22:38 - when you talk about
22:39 - beautifying it i get you but i mean i
22:42 - think it's not so much about how it
22:43 - looks it's more that it's easy to see
22:45 - all of that really practical content
22:47 - like when you looked into it that shows
22:48 - so much about um
22:50 - amino's craftsmanship with how he puts
22:52 - his posts together
22:53 - his skill sets um his consistency i
22:56 - think it's about
22:56 - a lot more than the aesthetic but i
22:58 - totally hear you because if you're about
23:00 - to hire somebody you want to be able to
23:01 - see their consistency
23:03 - you always you want to be able to see
23:04 - their thought process so
23:06 - remember remember we didn't just look at
23:08 - it and go he has pretty photos on here
23:10 - because i think anybody can do that
23:11 - we're really looking at everything just
23:13 - like for example the fact that i'm
23:14 - looking at
23:15 - you're constantly misspelling everything
23:18 - that would make me actually not
23:19 - hire you like like literally you know
23:21 - what i mean so
23:23 - if that's the case actually social media
23:26 - could hurt you in this case
23:28 - but if you are using it in a good way
23:31 - and you are using it to share value with
23:33 - other people that's what i care about
23:36 - and that's what most business owners
23:37 - care about that you're providing value
23:39 - to people so
23:41 - i think it's a massive plus i mean think
23:43 - about the reason why you're here right
23:44 - now
23:46 - right like why are you here on this
23:49 - stream right now
23:50 - it's because we are providing you value
23:54 - we have a beautiful thumbnail with a
23:56 - beautiful title of make money with
23:58 - programming
23:59 - you are in to get value out of that and
24:02 - you are here and we're currently like 20
24:05 - minutes or 30 minutes in
24:06 - it's because it's bringing you value in
24:08 - some type of way so as long as your
24:10 - guys's north star is bringing value not
24:12 - beauty that will really really help you
24:16 - so even when i'm seeing a lot of the
24:18 - profile you know of rachel or
24:20 - when you know we're going through our
24:21 - hiring process and when we're looking at
24:23 - amanath
24:24 - we're able to see that you're providing
24:26 - value and we want that person on the
24:28 - team that's providing value
24:30 - like before they even have a job
24:34 - yep so just my two cents
24:39 - okay
24:43 - all right so okay should we move on to
24:45 - the next one rachel
24:47 - yeah absolutely nice okay so talk to us
24:50 - about this
24:52 - slides that i put in yeah
24:56 - i think such such a good point though
24:58 - isn't it um yeah
24:59 - i like it like you were saying about the
25:01 - value that your potential employer
25:03 - client will get from um seeing your
25:07 - personal growth in your thought process
25:08 - if you've got that
25:10 - if you've got those posts that give an
25:11 - insight into um
25:13 - especially things like how invested you
25:14 - are and how you take on feedback you
25:16 - know there's so much that you can
25:17 - you can tell as a story in in in that
25:20 - social media
25:21 - yep 100 percent so documenting your even
25:24 - right now
25:25 - i'm you know amanath is not saying he's
25:27 - an expert
25:28 - he is basically saying hey i'm on day 36
25:31 - out of day 70.
25:33 - he's just telling the truth and if
25:35 - somebody's looking to hire maybe they're
25:36 - looking for an intern
25:38 - that might be a perfect fit they're
25:39 - looking for somebody who's willing to
25:41 - learn fast
25:42 - might be a great fit for them logan says
25:45 - if you want to separate your work and
25:46 - your personal on instagram just make a
25:48 - second account and direct your followers
25:50 - kind of what rachel you were saying a
25:51 - little bit earlier
25:53 - and then ziad says he says i think if
25:57 - your profile is private no one will know
25:59 - who you are and i don't think you'll be
26:01 - able to grow your business so have two
26:03 - profiles one private and the other one
26:04 - for your business
26:05 - so i think that could be also another
26:07 - good way to go
26:09 - yeah for sure um awesome
26:13 - uh oshea says this means a lot thank you
26:15 - so much and can't agree more
26:18 - and what you and rachel have just said
26:20 - so
26:22 - awesome job rachel we're we're crushing
26:24 - it
26:25 - thank you and yeah even document the
26:29 - failures you know if something is bad
26:31 - or like your code is not working or a
26:33 - project is broken
26:34 - broken you can even share that that's
26:36 - actually helpful
26:38 - okay so it's so so helpful right and
26:40 - that just shows so much about character
26:42 - i think that speaks to what you were
26:43 - just saying cassie about value
26:45 - yeah um is that i know i don't know what
26:48 - you'd say but when you're higher in the
26:49 - first thing you're looking to is that
26:50 - character
26:51 - yep character traits the skills skill
26:53 - can be trained
26:54 - yes and taught but the character that's
26:57 - that's what you want to put across and
26:58 - it's such a good way to do that it's so
27:01 - it's such a good way to do that because
27:02 - most people are trained for
27:04 - answers like hey what's your biggest
27:06 - weakness and they're like
27:07 - honesty you know biggest weakness i'm
27:10 - just too honest or like what's your
27:12 - biggest biggest weakness i'm too
27:13 - hard-working
27:15 - and so you don't want those people on
27:17 - your i literally had to
27:19 - end the interview with some people and
27:21 - be like okay all right thank you so much
27:22 - for coming in but and i ended the
27:24 - interview because
27:26 - they um there's so much like
27:29 - politics built into them you don't want
27:32 - people to bring in
27:33 - politics or circular type of answers
27:36 - to the business or the culture that's
27:38 - actually poison
27:39 - and so a lot of us are actually trained
27:42 - wrong
27:43 - you would rather be at the interview and
27:45 - just say i don't know
27:46 - but i can figure it out like i'll i can
27:49 - get back to you tonight on it
27:52 - you would much rather have that so you
27:54 - can just that's why documenting your
27:55 - failures can be a very
27:57 - great sign of your overall
27:59 - characteristics as a human being because
28:01 - they're hiring the human
28:04 - yeah yeah definitely it speaks so much
28:06 - to your character doesn't it
28:07 - yeah awesome okay so
28:11 - what's up with the call booking okay so
28:15 - i'd say with zoom a lot a lot of people
28:17 - are probably already on the case there
28:18 - with kovid and everything being online
28:20 - now um
28:22 - but just making sure that you've got
28:23 - those basics like you've got a zoom
28:25 - account ready
28:26 - um and you've got calendly um
28:29 - just as a as a great service for having
28:32 - your cat you can put your calendar on
28:33 - there
28:34 - um people can book in specific times
28:36 - with you um
28:37 - i think there's even a paid option if
28:39 - you're doing things like coaching and
28:40 - one-off freelancers
28:41 - where it's so straightforward yep
28:43 - they're booking the
28:44 - page done so just making things as
28:46 - simple as possible
28:48 - yep and getting those optimized yep
28:51 - and i don't have to with calendly you
28:53 - know you and i don't have to keep having
28:55 - a back and forth on like
28:56 - what's a good time for you 6 p.m doesn't
28:59 - work for me but
29:00 - can we do 7 30 p.m no that doesn't work
29:03 - for me can we do
29:04 - you know what i mean and like then only
29:06 - to realize that comes
29:08 - exactly i'm just gonna say only to
29:09 - realize i was talking pst and you were
29:11 - talking
29:12 - like uk time and eight hour difference
29:14 - with calendly we don't have to do that
29:16 - you can just send somebody a thing and
29:18 - then they can just
29:19 - book your free availability so
29:22 - you know i think for freelancers or
29:24 - people who want to freelance i think
29:26 - guys this can be a really important
29:27 - resource for you because if you want to
29:30 - set up an interview with somebody right
29:31 - rachel like your potential employer
29:34 - you don't want to have them like chasing
29:36 - around you
29:37 - trying to book a time you want to make
29:39 - it an easy process for them
29:40 - oh yeah absolutely you want to make it
29:42 - as easy as possible
29:44 - so that they just get it done like you
29:46 - said yeah totally totally
29:48 - and you avoid doing the time zone dance
29:50 - yes
29:51 - so yeah definitely avoid that dance
29:54 - because
29:54 - it's not good for anybody so great so
29:57 - get
29:58 - get these things and get comfortable
30:00 - with calendly get comfortable with zoom
30:02 - i mean i would say even learn like
30:04 - annotating in zoom
30:05 - like how i'm annotating so much yeah
30:10 - okay so that's it i mean they're free
30:12 - they're both free you can just get them
30:14 - you can play around with them you can
30:15 - get really comfortable for them for when
30:16 - you
30:16 - start needing them yes exactly
30:20 - all right so let's move on to the next
30:22 - one
30:26 - okay so next step so you you want to set
30:28 - up what we call in your defense first so
30:30 - you want to get your profiles ready
30:32 - um on the different platforms that
30:33 - you're going to use your own your own
30:35 - personal social
30:36 - media um and then
30:39 - it's time to go love clients so the way
30:42 - that i did it was just to kind of
30:43 - systemize it especially to kind of make
30:47 - it
30:47 - non-overwhelming just create a system um
30:50 - every day to do certain actions and go
30:52 - out and make sure that i was doing
30:54 - things that would help me move towards
30:55 - getting clients um so
30:58 - if you want to hop onto the next one
31:00 - causey sure thing
31:02 - i'll show you the actual tool in a
31:04 - minute um
31:06 - but yeah if you want to start with your
31:07 - research and i know you've talked a lot
31:10 - carly about specific platforms that are
31:11 - good
31:12 - um just so many so many places that you
31:15 - could be looking
31:16 - but you basically want to make a list of
31:18 - say upwork
31:20 - people per hour there are various
31:23 - slack communities where your ideal
31:26 - clients might be hanging out
31:29 - facebook groups yep um in person meetups
31:32 - online meetups
31:36 - yep just i'd say the very first thing i
31:39 - did was get that list
31:40 - get it all together and have it ready
31:42 - for every time that i wanted to go out
31:43 - and look for
31:44 - potential clients yeah um
31:48 - then off the back of that um
31:52 - it was to um to hop onto the
31:56 - next one next slide please yeah cool
31:58 - cool yeah
31:59 - you can just say next that's fine okay
32:01 - thank you
32:02 - um oh next again that's just a little
32:05 - nice
32:06 - little dance two-step dance
32:10 - so there we go so this is just um one
32:12 - example of a tool there i mean there are
32:13 - plenty out there that you can use this
32:14 - one's called um meister task or there's
32:16 - trello that a lot of people probably use
32:18 - so say that again what is this one
32:20 - called this is called meister task
32:22 - ah yeah yeah yeah i've heard of this
32:24 - okay so let me actually write that
32:26 - meister task that's what the tool cool
32:29 - and it's it free
32:31 - um yeah yeah i'm pretty sure the basic
32:32 - level is free
32:34 - okay cool got it go ahead i mean trello
32:37 - is really similar
32:38 - um but this yeah this is the first step
32:42 - at kind of creating a system so
32:44 - to have this board there um carve out
32:47 - time
32:48 - and in those time blocks to um which
32:51 - i'll come on to in a moment but
32:53 - in those time blocks go out and look for
32:54 - clients and then use this as like your
32:56 - hub
32:57 - of who you've spoken to so that when
33:00 - you're when you're out there and you're
33:01 - chatting to people
33:02 - um or you've sent off an application on
33:04 - upwork
33:05 - you can remember what you've done and
33:06 - you can follow them up
33:08 - so you'd pop everybody into the
33:10 - potential clients as much information as
33:11 - you could
33:12 - um but you could also use something like
33:14 - this is if you're kind of
33:16 - really proactively reaching out to
33:17 - people that you would like to work with
33:18 - like say you kazi
33:20 - um say somebody was thinking i really
33:22 - wanted to be on the cp team
33:24 - yep they'd add clever programmer in
33:26 - there as a potential client
33:27 - then you'd go out and you'd just get as
33:29 - much information about that
33:31 - company and about cars as you could that
33:33 - would really help you how to
33:35 - reach out um the email addresses
33:37 - instagram handles
33:39 - various different ways that you can get
33:40 - in touch pop it all on a card in there
33:42 - and then off you go you've got those
33:44 - people to start
33:45 - tackling when you're when you're out
33:46 - there and you're starting to try and get
33:48 - momentum
33:49 - yep got it that is huge
33:53 - i think that is a great way to put it
33:55 - and you're very systematic with this so
33:58 - i think like
33:58 - maybe we should bring you on one time to
34:00 - even do like an
34:01 - actual tutorial of how you use these how
34:04 - you use these tools i think that will be
34:06 - actually really valuable to people
34:09 - if that would be valuable to you guys do
34:11 - drop it in the comments below because
34:13 - rachel has she's very systematic she's
34:16 - very analytical and she's
34:17 - very good with systems and processes so
34:20 - things like following up reaching out
34:23 - and having a solid way to go about it
34:25 - i think that could be pretty valuable
34:27 - for everybody
34:29 - we got also one super donation so thank
34:31 - you so much for that and actually just
34:33 - right now we got another one by
34:34 - conscious code
34:37 - so rachel people are loving this and um
34:41 - let's see what he said he says hey i'm
34:42 - done well versed with data structures
34:45 - and algorithms in c
34:46 - plus i want to move to web development i
34:48 - have no idea about web how can i start
34:51 - i'm confused with the technologies how
34:53 - to start
34:55 - you are in the right place you should
34:58 - really just watch this channel and even
35:01 - the live stream builds that we're doing
35:03 - do those with us and they literally show
35:06 - you
35:06 - how to build your portfolio and then how
35:08 - you can land your job so
35:10 - even tomorrow we're going to be building
35:11 - a spotify clone
35:14 - so actually guys i do want to let you
35:16 - know tomorrow we're building a spotify
35:18 - clone right here on this channel
35:21 - and that will be pretty mind-blowing so
35:23 - if you are excited about that
35:25 - put it in your calendars like literally
35:27 - set up alarms for it
35:28 - and let me know that you're registered
35:30 - for the spotify training i'm going to
35:32 - give you a shout out
35:33 - but put it in your calendar put set up
35:36 - alarms for it
35:37 - it's going to be 10 15 a.m monday
35:39 - pacific time

35:52 - guys what can you do to make sure this
35:54 - video goes out to everybody
35:56 - rachel what can they do to make sure
35:57 - this video goes out to everybody and it
36:00 - doesn't cost them anything
36:04 - i'm sorry i lost you what can they do
36:07 - rachel right now
36:08 - to make sure this video goes out to
36:10 - everybody and it doesn't cost them
36:12 - anything
36:13 - oh hit the like button please i didn't
36:16 - say it this time guys rachel said it
36:20 - go smash that like button and it make
36:22 - sure that this if you're
36:23 - have if you're getting value from this
36:25 - this will just spread send it out to so
36:27 - many people
36:28 - and we just work really hard to prepare
36:30 - all these trainings for you guys
36:31 - and by just hitting that one button
36:33 - helps us so much
36:35 - you won't even believe so please go
36:36 - ahead and do that and with that said
36:38 - let's jump right back into the training
36:41 - yeah for sure and i mean if if if you
36:43 - guys think it would be helpful i can
36:45 - totally go into this in more detail um
36:48 - in another training but yeah the gist of
36:50 - it then
36:51 - um is you can also obviously see who you
36:53 - need to follow up so
36:55 - i think that's so that it's so easy to
36:57 - slip through the cracks to send
36:58 - something off
36:59 - and not do a follow-up but if you've got
37:01 - it all here in black and white that can
37:03 - be really effective
37:04 - yep yeah um
37:07 - awesome so let's go on to the next slide
37:12 - so what's okay so go ahead take it away
37:15 - rachel
37:16 - okay so um conferences so we just
37:21 - thinking here of just really opening
37:24 - your mind to all of the different
37:26 - opportunities there are to meet people
37:28 - that you could potentially be your
37:29 - clients
37:30 - um i mean we've talked a lot about the
37:32 - online places that you can be but of
37:34 - course
37:34 - in person yeah um and even even
37:38 - digitally you know that now a lot of the
37:39 - conferences are going online at the
37:41 - moment aren't they
37:42 - yep in person
37:45 - yeah in person is a little bit tricky
37:46 - for now but a lot of these conferences
37:49 - are online so you can
37:50 - still network with like-minded people in
37:52 - the same way and you just never know
37:53 - who you're going to meet i know you've
37:54 - seen a lot of success at conferences
37:56 - haven't you crazy
37:57 - oh yeah tons of success at conferences
38:00 - literally last conference we went to
38:02 - you know we closed somebody for five
38:05 - thousand dollars
38:07 - right there at the conference like
38:08 - literally before leaving the conference
38:10 - and i think we had paid
38:12 - three thousand to book the hotels and
38:14 - take frankie and aaron with me to the
38:16 - conference so
38:17 - we got our we got that up front and then
38:20 - daniel joined our team
38:22 - and then he ended up closing multiple
38:24 - people on our high ticket program
38:27 - so just that conference alone directly
38:29 - made us over ten thousand dollars in
38:32 - like cash today
38:33 - so conferences are
38:36 - killer you guys they're super powerful
38:38 - but again with covet i think that's
38:40 - going to be a little tricky
38:42 - a little tricky but online you know
38:44 - there's so much online there are a lot
38:45 - of the
38:46 - online summits and there are still a lot
38:47 - of those places you can find where these
38:48 - people are hanging out
38:50 - yep 100
38:53 - okay so let's go on to the next one go
38:55 - ahead
38:58 - okay so this was just kind of speaking
39:00 - to this
39:02 - tripping over specifics of um of that
39:05 - outreach so you just want to kind of try
39:07 - and
39:08 - especially if you're a little bit off
39:10 - put by the idea of reaching out to
39:11 - people just turn it into a habit
39:13 - so block out time on the calendar put it
39:15 - on there every day maybe every day at
39:16 - the same time
39:17 - um and then go in there
39:21 - um have your list of who you're gonna
39:23 - reach out to
39:24 - all of the different places so if you're
39:26 - anything like me then your brain isn't
39:27 - distracted
39:28 - with too many options yeah um and
39:31 - excuses
39:32 - because you've got everything else you
39:33 - can go to your list and go okay i'm
39:34 - gonna try upwork i'm gonna
39:36 - go to go to the facebook groups and look
39:37 - for look where people american connect
39:39 - with
39:40 - um i'm gonna think about conferences i'm
39:42 - gonna look at my board and see who i can
39:44 - follow up with who i can reach out to
39:45 - i've been admiring for some time you
39:47 - know you've got all of those options
39:49 - and you've got that time specifically
39:51 - kind of scheduled out
39:52 - to make sure that it's something that
39:53 - becomes a habit yep
39:57 - yep i think yeah making it a habit i
39:59 - think is a really important point where
40:01 - almost like
40:02 - you're not even that emotional about it
40:04 - you just do it as a discipline at some
40:05 - point
40:07 - you know yeah i think that's that way of
40:09 - building relationships is important
40:12 - yeah yeah definitely definitely i think
40:14 - especially if the idea is
40:16 - is overwhelming initially um to some
40:18 - people like and then
40:19 - if you hop to the next one causey sure
40:22 - um something i found really good if
40:26 - if that is you too is the pomodoro
40:27 - technique and i know that's
40:28 - traditionally more of a kind of
40:30 - time management strategy but the way
40:33 - i've always
40:34 - always used it for outreach was okay i'm
40:36 - gonna set this timer
40:38 - i'm gonna put aside especially any of
40:40 - you know the negative the self-talk and
40:42 - the imposter syndrome
40:43 - i'm just gonna check that out at the
40:44 - door for a minute i'm gonna stop
40:45 - thinking about the distractions like the
40:47 - kids and the washing and you know
40:49 - but you set that timer and in that time
40:51 - you're in the zone and you're gonna
40:52 - fully promote yourself you know
40:54 - that's where you're gonna put your
40:55 - energy turn up best foot forward
40:58 - and off you go that's actually really
41:01 - great advice to
41:02 - like actually just have a pomodoro timer
41:05 - and it's about 25
41:06 - 20 minute timer and then just focus on
41:08 - doing the outreach
41:10 - and then after that you're just done yep
41:12 - but like laser focus
41:14 - and john sonmez in his book soft skills
41:16 - talks about this technique as well i
41:17 - think it's a powerful technique
41:20 - to your point about the conferences
41:22 - amanda says there's
41:23 - a lot of conferences happening online
41:26 - right now he says
41:27 - i attended a few conferences during this
41:29 - lockdown
41:30 - and i met a lot of cool people from
41:32 - google and major companies and was able
41:34 - to talk to them
41:36 - wow that's so powerful isn't it that's
41:38 - huge that's
41:39 - that's really huge um
41:42 - and again this is also from the last i
41:45 - think webinar
41:46 - frankie was talking about this as well
41:48 - on the pomodoro
41:49 - but guys like finding your learning
41:51 - style is important and
41:53 - you know time management productivity
41:55 - hacks like pomodoro are really really
41:57 - helpful
41:57 - and then rachel i also want to hear your
41:59 - thoughts on being able to handle stress
42:01 - and anxiety through things like
42:03 - meditation or anything else
42:05 - yeah for sure so i think um
42:10 - a lot of that well a lot of that is kind
42:11 - of tied in with what we were just
42:13 - talking about with the outreach and
42:14 - having a kind of specific system around
42:16 - it
42:17 - when you're especially when you're
42:18 - really keen that you want to get things
42:19 - moving um
42:21 - if that's overwhelming having some kind
42:22 - of system helps
42:24 - but also for me things that have been
42:27 - really great for um
42:28 - handing them are just like making sure
42:30 - that you you know you look after
42:31 - yourself the normal stuff
42:32 - the exercise keep keeping your energy up
42:35 - meditation
42:36 - um and i think a gratitude practice is a
42:41 - really good
42:41 - a really good um one to adopt as well
42:45 - yep agreed yeah uh gratitude practice
42:49 - even tony robbins talks about that a lot
42:51 - um yeah yeah so let's go on
42:56 - my bad my bad you can finish your
42:57 - thoughts that's okay i was just gonna
43:00 - i was just gonna say that um i mean even
43:02 - especially if you're reaching out um
43:04 - reaching out to clients taking those few
43:06 - minutes to um make sure that you're in
43:08 - kind of
43:08 - try and shift yourself from what might
43:10 - be a stress or anxious state to
43:12 - a positive one could be huge in in terms
43:15 - of results that you get as well
43:16 - just taking that time maybe you do a
43:18 - meditation maybe you
43:20 - maybe journaling works for you putting
43:21 - on a music that changes your state
43:24 - doing some jumping jacks hitting
43:25 - something whatever it is that does that
43:27 - for you
43:31 - yeah i think that that is definitely
43:33 - really like
43:34 - some people even have those tiny
43:36 - trampolines in their house
43:37 - have you ever seen those
43:41 - epic webs says for me the stress slash
43:44 - anxiety is also
43:45 - addressed by trying to hide your
43:47 - failures as mentioned previously
43:49 - be honest and don't worry about asking
43:52 - other people for help
43:54 - oh so true so that is really really huge
43:58 - and yeah i think those things are really
43:59 - important they set your foundation
44:01 - really really right yeah now moving on
44:05 - talk to us about like personalize your
44:08 - messages
44:09 - okay so this is um
44:13 - this is where we met kazi oh
44:16 - this is actually holy crap this is
44:18 - actually your real message to me the
44:20 - first one
44:21 - actual first one yep yep there was a
44:23 - kind of um
44:24 - a little proposal that goes with it but
44:26 - this was the cover letter so this is
44:27 - what i sent to try and
44:28 - stand out when i saw your your the job
44:30 - application
44:31 - and now you've been working with us for
44:33 - what two point
44:36 - first ever message
44:39 - and now this is so cool this is so cool
44:42 - you guys like the fact that and now
44:43 - she's been working with us for two
44:45 - and a half years at cp that's insane
44:49 - like that is one of the coolest things i
44:51 - mean nobody i've never seen a training
44:53 - like this
44:53 - like this is so cool that we can talk
44:55 - about this
44:56 - it's crazy right yeah that is insane
44:59 - go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks
45:01 - to how much power there is in
45:03 - um just really putting some effort into
45:07 - the right kind of job application or
45:08 - whatever whatever way that you're
45:10 - reaching out to people
45:11 - putting some thought into it doing your
45:12 - research on who the other person is
45:15 - um really taking your time and
45:17 - especially on platforms like at work you
45:19 - see a lot of
45:20 - copy and pastes yes you know oh my god
45:22 - people just
45:24 - they just apply for this every all these
45:26 - jobs with the same thing it doesn't
45:28 - speak to
45:28 - your own application to the skills to
45:30 - the character which if you can just take
45:32 - that time to really
45:33 - um really hone in on what they're asking
45:36 - for
45:37 - um because i mean all the time to your
45:40 - point i would get these like garbage
45:41 - messages on upwork and
45:43 - just like hey really interesting
45:46 - project you have there i could
45:48 - definitely help you and then blah blah
45:50 - and i'm like
45:51 - that's your what 104th copy paste of the
45:54 - day
45:55 - you know yeah and so when i saw a
45:58 - message like
45:59 - yours it was extremely refreshing to see
46:02 - somebody who actually
46:03 - read what we had written and wrote
46:06 - specifically for that
46:08 - so like what rachel is saying is like
46:10 - guys stop
46:12 - using canned messages when you reach out
46:15 - to these platforms
46:17 - it's not a game of volume it's a game of
46:19 - like reaching out with quality
46:21 - yeah yeah oh totally totally um and i
46:24 - want to even read out your message
46:25 - because i think it's really important
46:27 - you guys could even use this as a
46:28 - template
46:29 - so rachel reached down and she said hi
46:32 - there and she goes
46:33 - i really enjoyed reading your job
46:35 - posting and it would be awesome to chat
46:37 - with you about whether i'd be a good fit
46:39 - for the role honestly when i read this
46:42 - i thought it was like a canned message
46:44 - probably
46:45 - you know most likely because that's what
46:47 - i got from a lot of people
46:49 - but then this is where i got interested
46:51 - i love problem solving and getting tech
46:53 - tools to work together
46:55 - my background is ten years in
46:56 - accountancy and admin but six months ago
46:59 - i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal
47:01 - work is in problem solving
47:03 - so here she said problem solving love
47:06 - problem solving
47:07 - in my initial job posting i had
47:10 - mentioned problem solving multiple times
47:13 - um yeah i think i've popped the post a
47:15 - little further down as well causey so
47:16 - it's there in case yeah
47:17 - oh yeah that's awesome we can actually
47:19 - take a look at that too
47:21 - um oh wow even amanat is
47:25 - he's like um he's this letter is amazing
47:27 - i've never thought of writing a letter
47:28 - like that
47:29 - finally wishing i'm good this is awesome
47:32 - so
47:32 - here um so i've got experience in
47:35 - leadpages and various email webinar
47:37 - payment
47:38 - course systems these specific systems we
47:40 - were talking about
47:42 - but not kajabi and this is honestly one
47:45 - of those things that kind of just like
47:46 - hits you in the heart like this was one
47:48 - of the things where i'm like
47:50 - not only do we not have somebody who's
47:52 - possibly really good at it
47:55 - but the fact that she says openly she
47:58 - doesn't know kajabi
48:00 - and not like some wishy-washy
48:03 - answer
48:03 - like literally she's like not kajabi
48:06 - that is
48:07 - huge because already i can tell so much
48:10 - about her
48:11 - character and integrity and i want to
48:14 - work with somebody on the team who has
48:16 - character and integrity
48:18 - i don't want to work with people who put
48:20 - politics
48:22 - above everything else right
48:25 - so going on and she goes yet i'm really
48:27 - keen to learn all of these systems so
48:29 - that's important to me that she's very
48:31 - flexible
48:32 - and so would be very happy in my element
48:35 - in fact to learn them
48:37 - quickly and on my own time like that is
48:40 - just
48:41 - beautifully written it's like somebody's
48:43 - dream to have somebody like that working
48:45 - on their team
48:46 - where they're like hey i would i don't
48:49 - know them this is actually funny right
48:50 - because
48:51 - at the start of this video that's what i
48:54 - said
48:54 - if you don't know it just say it and say
48:56 - i'll be able to willing to learn later
48:58 - literally what you say here and um we
49:02 - have messages that are like
49:03 - joseph says uh this is a working
49:06 - template
49:06 - nice one rachel o'shea says rachel's
49:09 - letter is perfect it's brief
49:11 - specific and detailed really good job so
49:16 - that lucy says this is so useful
49:20 - asan says eloquent amazing job says
49:24 - amanath abdullah says yeah rachel
49:26 - amazing job
49:28 - no thanks guys yeah seriously it's
49:31 - actually really amazing and then she
49:33 - goes i love research and have found some
49:35 - great resources so i can quickly get
49:37 - familiar with them i pride myself in
49:40 - being proactive a strong communicator
49:42 - and a great team player
49:44 - honestly this statement i trust if
49:47 - anybody else says it i would just ignore
49:48 - it
49:49 - but like do you guys know what makes me
49:53 - want to trust this statement more like
49:56 - what
49:56 - out of this entire thing what was it
49:59 - that makes me actually trust this
50:01 - statement more
50:02 - and if you want to guess drop it in the
50:04 - comments below but for me
50:06 - it was actually this statement where she
50:08 - just openly is so honest
50:10 - and willing to say i don't know kajabi
50:13 - and then when you say you pride yourself
50:16 - in being a strong communicator and great
50:18 - team player
50:18 - i trust you see what i'm saying yeah
50:21 - yeah like
50:22 - because i'm like okay i she why would
50:25 - you say that
50:26 - if you were somebody who was just lying
50:28 - you know because you literally went out
50:29 - of your way to say you didn't know
50:31 - something
50:32 - yeah yep um abdullah says amazing tips
50:35 - thanks for the advice sure says this is
50:37 - nice um
50:39 - we have everything ipad pro says the way
50:42 - she writes is just beautiful
50:45 - yeah minik says i've never thought of
50:48 - writing such a thing this is awesome
50:50 - yep and then she even goes on to say
50:52 - look forward to hearing from you if
50:53 - you'd like to discuss
50:54 - more and best of luck with finding
50:56 - someone awesome
50:57 - i mean who goes out of their way to even
51:01 - encourage you and be
51:02 - happy for you to find somebody else
51:04 - that's awesome
51:05 - ending on such a positive note is
51:08 - another huge thing
51:10 - everything eyepatch pro says rachel is
51:12 - an independent and strong woman
51:14 - and uh she's proud of you
51:17 - oh thank you yeah yeah
51:22 - and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had
51:25 - a really nice message to this and he
51:27 - says
51:28 - he said the letter is amazing i've never
51:30 - thought of writing such a letter
51:31 - finally wishing them and and he goes you
51:34 - finally
51:35 - wishing somebody good luck and finding
51:37 - that is this seriously shows the mindset
51:40 - of rachel
51:42 - so so that's yeah so that's huge because
51:45 - it shows
51:47 - where her mindset is
51:50 - and this is the letter that like
51:52 - resulted in i don't know
51:54 - fifty thousand dollars and more like i
51:56 - don't know i don't even know at this
51:57 - point how
51:58 - where we're at but like this is
52:01 - literally has led to over a fifty
52:04 - thousand dollar transaction
52:06 - and probably we're gonna work until
52:09 - many many more years like we like
52:11 - literally i would love to have rachel on
52:13 - the team for the next three
52:14 - five ten years on clever programmer and
52:17 - it all came
52:19 - from right here so it doesn't really get
52:21 - any more real than this
52:23 - yep pretty crazy
52:27 - that's crazy right
52:31 - you never thought one day your letter
52:33 - that you were gonna write was gonna be
52:34 - like broadcasted to thousands of people
52:38 - no i really didn't oh man i think you're
52:41 - right you're right it just
52:42 - shows the power of taking that time
52:44 - taking that time to really
52:46 - stop um stop think put yourself in the
52:48 - other person's shoes as to what they're
52:49 - looking for and
52:50 - yeah and like like we were talking about
52:52 - to put yourself in the right
52:53 - state when you're when you're
52:54 - approaching it as well you know put
52:56 - make sure you're in that positive place
52:58 - where you can write it with like all of
52:59 - the
53:00 - enthusiasm and best intentions and then
53:03 - you know let go yes yep
53:07 - john ford says rachel is a true
53:09 - professional her work
53:11 - her insta profile and this letter now
53:13 - everything speaks about how cool and
53:15 - good at her work she is
53:17 - simply amazing be like rachel
53:20 - no damn and o'shea says it takes
53:23 - just one good letter to change your life
53:26 - yep and uh kringet says nice message
53:30 - it's awesome the whole thing especially
53:31 - about being honest
53:32 - yep so
53:36 - i mean yeah this is something that's
53:37 - really valuable if you guys want to take
53:39 - a screenshot of this before we move on
53:41 - go ahead
53:42 - and do that it'll give you kind of like
53:44 - a template but again
53:45 - her whole point is personalized yeah
53:48 - yeah totally but even within
53:50 - personalization this is a good template
53:52 - to kind of work
53:53 - off of uh so what else rachel before we
53:57 - move on to the next slide
53:59 - yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking
54:01 - about how important personalizing is
54:03 - but there's a little note there about um
54:05 - a swipe file and by that what i mean is
54:07 - not copy and paste in
54:09 - um the same thing to every job but just
54:11 - having a couple of notes
54:12 - um if you know if you're doing a lot of
54:15 - outreach
54:16 - um you're reaching out to quite a few
54:18 - people that you're really interested in
54:20 - just having a little kind of swipe file
54:21 - of phrases that explain your skills that
54:23 - you can still word in from so you don't
54:25 - put too much
54:26 - mental energy into that that's
54:27 - unnecessary i think that's something
54:28 - that's quite handy too
54:30 - yep a hundred percent so
54:33 - definitely use have those handy so that
54:36 - you can use them as reference and then
54:37 - grow
54:39 - like leverage them to be be able to
54:41 - write
54:42 - but guys yeah this is something that's
54:44 - really important it shows you
54:45 - it's not so much praying spray and just
54:48 - like
54:48 - reach out to 5 000 locations
54:52 - you can if you spend more time and you
54:54 - reach out with precision
54:56 - your success rate honestly is going to
54:58 - be much higher don't
55:00 - overthink it as well like don't spend
55:02 - three hours on a message
55:04 - but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10
55:06 - or 10 minutes personalizing
55:08 - write it and move on that would be
55:09 - really good yeah
55:12 - awesome so asa ali says i'm about to
55:15 - start my first freelancing job this is
55:17 - really helpful
55:18 - you guys deserve a lot thank you guys
55:20 - awesome
55:22 - congratulations yeah
55:25 - uh tam mayor tim marlon says rachel i
55:27 - would want
55:28 - you to teach me writing true and very
55:30 - like detailed messages like these
55:32 - that's cool how to have a chat with you
55:35 - awesome okay so let's keep it moving so
55:38 - let's go on to the next one
55:41 - and uh this was the actual job posting
55:44 - right
55:45 - mm-hmm yeah yep so this is the job
55:47 - posting
55:48 - go ahead i'm just gonna say we just cut
55:50 - it up so yep that's
55:51 - it so yeah this is the posting guys this
55:54 - is part
55:55 - like this is you know the first part of
55:57 - it this is the second part of it it's
55:58 - the same posting we have we just cut it
56:00 - up so it's all on the same page
56:02 - but like uh my main thing we were
56:04 - looking for was
56:05 - people who knew about all these
56:07 - technologies kajabi drip click funnel
56:09 - sam cart webinar jams
56:11 - zapier but i said like we need someone
56:13 - who can manage these systems understand
56:15 - how they work
56:16 - and be able to do it and i wrote some
56:19 - specific
56:20 - things like you should be able to
56:22 - understand what we mean when we say
56:24 - xyz and if you don't know this you'd
56:27 - love to
56:28 - research it until you understand how it
56:30 - works and can put it together
56:32 - so you know going back and here i
56:34 - mentioned kajabi and going back to what
56:36 - rachel said
56:37 - she said in her message that she doesn't
56:39 - know kajabi but she's willing to learn
56:42 - it
56:42 - right and so she also understood like
56:44 - where i was coming from
56:46 - and then she mentioned that and she said
56:47 - i'd be willing to learn so it matches up
56:49 - to
56:49 - kind of what we were looking for and we
56:53 - said the right person will be confident
56:55 - in his
56:56 - his slash her intuition to figure out
56:59 - figure it out and get the job done
57:00 - correctly
57:01 - you may not know every platform but this
57:04 - is a type of work that makes you feel
57:05 - invincible
57:06 - and you are smart enough to figure it
57:08 - out and definitely when i spoke with
57:10 - rachel she already knew a lot of things
57:11 - and what she didn't know
57:13 - she said she would be willing to learn
57:15 - and then when i went on her social media
57:18 - on her facebook it confirmed with me she
57:20 - that she
57:21 - wasn't just saying words to say whatever
57:24 - she needed to say to get a job
57:26 - she was backing it up with her actions
57:28 - and i could see three months ago she was
57:30 - like
57:31 - posting about going down rabbit holes
57:33 - and learning about technology
57:35 - yeah so that was huge
57:38 - cool go ahead and remember also with
57:41 - that kazee
57:41 - right at the end of the requirements um
57:44 - and it said you wanted a minimum of two
57:45 - plus years hands-on
57:47 - administrative support experience oh
57:48 - yeah yeah yeah so and i know
57:50 - things like that would sometimes put
57:52 - people off with the specifics oh yeah
57:53 - that was just complete like i
57:55 - don't even know what that meant
57:56 - i just put that i had no idea what that
57:58 - even meant
58:00 - i don't even what is administrative
58:01 - support i have i had no idea
58:04 - exactly so it's always it's always worth
58:06 - it's always worth applying to something
58:07 - if you read it and you think yes
58:09 - and you connect you know even if there's
58:11 - something like that
58:12 - yeah so i mean like it also goes to show
58:17 - you that like
58:18 - and you didn't have that right just to
58:19 - be clear you didn't have two plus years
58:21 - of hands-on
58:22 - how much did you have um
58:25 - i think gosh six months to a year
58:28 - maybe at that point yeah so
58:32 - so basically another thing like don't
58:34 - say no for the other person
58:37 - yeah so like she
58:40 - she could have easily just said oh i
58:42 - don't have two years of experience
58:44 - i'm not gonna apply for this but she's
58:46 - just like
58:47 - she she applied for it anyway and it
58:49 - turns out
58:50 - that i was an idiot and i didn't even
58:53 - know what the hell i was looking for
58:54 - and i just put some random stuff in
58:56 - requirements and a lot of people who are
58:59 - looking
58:59 - like a lot of people who are actually
59:02 - posting these jobs
59:03 - from the hr department they even have no
59:05 - idea what the specs are
59:09 - yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you
59:11 - put it so well they're not saying no
59:13 - for them yeah so don't say no for them
59:16 - apply anyway
59:17 - intelligently and don't don't have those
59:19 - weird things put you off you know
59:21 - like um i saw this one post where the
59:24 - developer of the react.js library or
59:26 - something along those lines something
59:28 - really massive
59:29 - got rejected from a job and
59:33 - because they wanted like 10 years of
59:34 - experience
59:36 - and he says i have five years of
59:38 - experience or something along those
59:40 - lines
59:40 - and they're like sorry we need somebody
59:42 - with ten and then he made a tweet
59:44 - he says well i got rejected from a job
59:47 - but he goes i wrote the react.js library
59:50 - and it's only been out for five years
59:52 - oh wow so i was like oh wow
59:56 - so somebody can correct me in the chat
59:58 - below it's not really react and it's not
60:00 - the same time frame but the point is
60:02 - similar
60:03 - yeah so you know it's it's crazy but
60:07 - yeah all right moving on so what is
60:10 - going on here
60:11 - with this guy now this this guy's hiding
60:15 - from video
60:16 - oh no yeah i think the the one thing
60:19 - the other one thing i'd maybe do a
60:21 - little differently now
60:23 - um if i was kind of actively looking
60:26 - on that point right now is i would add
60:28 - in video
60:30 - so and in addition to because people
60:32 - like different platforms in addition to
60:33 - that written
60:34 - um message that i sent i would probably
60:37 - make a really short video
60:39 - just so that you can really connect with
60:41 - the other person because video's so
60:42 - powerful
60:43 - game changer so i think
60:46 - if you hop to the next one kazi um yeah
60:50 - we're just talking about loom there um
60:52 - and i mean even when you're working with
60:53 - clients like there's an example there
60:55 - um this is loom if anybody hasn't used
60:57 - it before it's a free tool
60:59 - yep and here's your face this is a video
61:01 - here's her face
61:02 - talking over it and then she's sharing
61:04 - her screen but keep going rachel
61:06 - yeah yeah exactly this is me talking
61:09 - about something in one of our systems
61:11 - in kajabi but yeah i mean even once
61:13 - you're working with clients this could
61:14 - be so powerful just to kind of
61:16 - catch up especially if you're on
61:17 - different time zones and things but in
61:18 - the outreach phase
61:20 - um so so good for them to really get a
61:23 - feel for you
61:25 - um and i mean i've i can imagine that
61:27 - you would do this like if i would say
61:28 - research in clever programmer talk about
61:31 - clever program again you could be on the
61:32 - clever program or website
61:33 - you could have that with the screen
61:34 - shared you could show what you were
61:36 - finding
61:37 - um talk over it and yeah did a video so
61:40 - powerful so i would
61:41 - just get comfortable with that um
61:44 - and with something like loom i mean you
61:45 - can even start by practicing if if video
61:47 - is something that
61:48 - is really um terrifying to you um you
61:52 - could just take baby steps
61:53 - um yeah you've got things like instagram
61:56 - stories you can use loom and you can
61:57 - just make videos for yourself and just
61:59 - steadily get used to seeing yourself on
62:00 - the camera
62:02 - um and then by the time that you're in a
62:04 - position where you're working with
62:05 - clients and you've got video calls it's
62:07 - just like in nature
62:09 - yep exactly i mean i try to start loom
62:12 - but i think my camera is being used up
62:15 - by another device so it's only like a
62:18 - yellow little mark here actually let me
62:21 - yeah let me end it right now but
62:25 - you you guys won't get a yellow mark
62:27 - like this which
62:28 - will happen is loom will record your
62:30 - screen so here
62:31 - i just record it for just a few seconds
62:34 - and you'll see it already created a link
62:36 - and the video is online so if you guys
62:39 - actually went to this link right here
62:41 - you'd be able to see this exact video i
62:44 - can even drop it in the chat
62:47 - i mean it's not a very awesome video but
62:50 - you get the point the fact that i was
62:51 - able to make a video in like a second
62:53 - and then boom it's up
62:55 - so what rachel is saying is she would
62:58 - now
62:58 - actually make a video talking about
63:02 - what the client is looking for and then
63:04 - send that directly through upwork and
63:06 - that will crush
63:07 - if i had seen a video from you i would
63:09 - be like it's game over
63:11 - like i would just yeah i would probably
63:12 - skip the interview
63:15 - that's it it just gives you that so much
63:16 - extra connection doesn't it there's so
63:18 - much you can get from a video
63:20 - yep as an extra tool
63:24 - exactly so let's let me
63:27 - go full screen this huge tool
63:31 - all right so keep going rachel and if
63:33 - you want me to move on to the next one i
63:34 - can do that too
63:36 - yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to
63:38 - the next one
63:39 - all right let's do it and ahmad says
63:42 - seriously the years of experience
63:43 - doesn't matter if you have the skills
63:45 - and that's
63:46 - it most people are afraid to apply for
63:47 - jobs when they see that years of
63:50 - experience
63:51 - mm-hmm yeah all right so true isn't it
63:54 - go for it rachel
63:55 - so true oh so this this is jen from um
63:59 - from our community the prophet
64:01 - javascript so i shared this because
64:03 - the other point i really want to talk
64:05 - about is the power of community
64:07 - um especially like when i was talking
64:08 - about that outreach stage earlier
64:10 - you know like for me when i was
64:12 - transitioning out of my job and into
64:14 - um freelance it's such a massive mindset
64:17 - shift
64:18 - um to go from that nine-to-five world to
64:21 - and to kind of like normalize the online
64:22 - world
64:23 - yeah when your friends and family are
64:25 - like you do you do what um
64:27 - yeah exactly they're like oh what are
64:29 - you doing and you're like i'm doing
64:30 - something on
64:31 - upwork yeah get away from me what's your
64:33 - job
64:34 - oh my god what the hell amberly just
64:38 - gave a five dollar super chat
64:41 - no and she said go rachel so proud of
64:45 - you
64:46 - crushing it and she goes i guess quasi
64:48 - is all right too
64:50 - oh i'm believing wow thank you so
64:54 - much amberly thank you i wish i could
64:56 - make you my girlfriend
64:58 - this is such a sweet person amberly
65:02 - oh man um so yeah this is jen so um
65:05 - yeah a huge a huge thing that's helpful
65:07 - in that kind of
65:08 - in that stage especially and with your
65:10 - mindset is just the people that you're
65:11 - surrounded by
65:13 - because they're gonna dictate what you
65:14 - think is possible um
65:16 - if you've got the right community around
65:18 - you you've got accountability you've got
65:19 - support
65:20 - um you've got people to ask questions
65:22 - you've got people to celebrate with you
65:24 - which is why you shared this post from
65:25 - jen
65:26 - especially um jen had this amazing win
65:30 - last week didn't you kazi
65:31 - um yeah and just look at those reactions
65:33 - from us
65:35 - so last week uh jen from our program
65:38 - profit with javascript actually got a
65:40 - job
65:40 - i don't know if you know this but she
65:41 - actually got a job offer
65:43 - uh so she got fired so here's the crazy
65:46 - thing about jen that happened
65:48 - she got fired uh because of
65:51 - covid a week ago
65:54 - and um those guys are dumb asses to fire
65:57 - her she's like one of the most amazing
65:58 - people
65:59 - you know i'm like i wish we could hire
66:01 - her so
66:03 - that happened and that was like sad but
66:06 - a week later she gets a
66:08 - job offer for twice as much so she was
66:11 - initially getting paid 46
66:12 - 000 something now she got a job offer
66:15 - for 95
66:16 - 000 a year with a six
66:19 - percent bonus year over year
66:23 - and uh there was yeah it was
66:25 - mind-blowing so
66:26 - that's the offer she got and um
66:29 - one the employer here's what the thing
66:32 - that he was impressed with
66:33 - so just think about how crazy that is
66:36 - last week
66:37 - she got she lost her job because of
66:38 - covid and then this week
66:40 - the employer was super impressed by her
66:43 - covet tracker app that she had built
66:45 - within
66:46 - profit with javascript and that's
66:48 - actually what made them decide to give
66:49 - her the 96k year offer
66:52 - man that's amazing isn't it
66:55 - yeah i was like what pretty crazy and
66:58 - even she says that she goes right at the
67:00 - end of the call
67:00 - i got a job offer at almost twice what i
67:03 - used to make
67:03 - they mentioned one thing that really
67:05 - impressed them was the covet tracker
67:08 - we are learning real world projects that
67:09 - land jobs and i think this actually has
67:12 - the most reactions i've ever seen
67:14 - yeah right so much going on there
67:18 - yeah seriously that's it and you you see
67:21 - that in the community all the time
67:22 - it's the power of being around people
67:24 - like that is um like i saw somebody
67:26 - posting there
67:27 - recently that they were struggling and
67:29 - so many so many other
67:30 - other members jumped in to give advice
67:32 - to give support and to lift them back up
67:34 - and that just makes such a difference
67:35 - between carrying on on what's
67:37 - a really hard journey and quitting and
67:40 - winning yep and uh
67:43 - there's somebody who said on the stream
67:46 - this

68:44 - yeah and here we are with google the
68:45 - ability to google is this important
68:48 - rachel
68:49 - it's so important
68:52 - go ahead rachel i'll let you speak to
68:54 - this one
68:55 - oh google it's just such a key skill
68:57 - isn't it it's it kind of speaks to what
68:58 - we said earlier as well about
69:00 - so much of um what makes you appealing
69:04 - to a client or an employer is your
69:06 - character
69:07 - um and then you kind of understand it
69:11 - and you can al
69:12 - always need to be able to find the right
69:14 - things with google
69:16 - um your resourcefulness
69:19 - yes yeah the resourcefulness is crazy
69:22 - and even with programming pretty much
69:24 - everything comes out to
69:25 - google link like a lot of it comes out
69:27 - to google and i saw this
69:29 - funny image today um let me see if i can
69:32 - actually find a way to
69:35 - um bring that up somehow
69:39 - let's see give me one second here i
69:41 - found like i found a really funny image
69:43 - on
69:44 - how googling works and how people like
69:46 - how people become developers
69:48 - okay i found it now what i have to do is
69:51 - actually send it over on slack
69:54 - so i'm going to send it over on slack
69:56 - real quick rachel
69:59 - and here we go okay guys just
70:04 - just stick with me here for just a few
70:06 - seconds
70:07 - and i think i got it all right i'm gonna
70:09 - bring it onto the screen
70:12 - come on slack come on slack
70:16 - all right please slack just
70:21 - okay all right
70:25 - boom sorry guys
70:28 - just one second this is funny so i have
70:30 - to show it to you
70:31 - all right there we go uh so
70:34 - catalin pitt i saw his uh tweet i think
70:37 - from him and he says let me break it
70:39 - down for you
70:40 - coding is one percent actually coding
70:45 - oh let me move my girlfriend's comment
70:47 - from the screen
70:48 - 40 debugging 15
70:52 - coffee breaks which rachel knows all
70:54 - about the coffee breaks
70:56 - 30 googling errors nine percent
71:00 - staring with your colleagues at the
71:01 - screen 100 true
71:04 - and then five percent trying to copy and
71:06 - paste solutions from stack overflow
71:10 - this right here guys is your guide to
71:13 - coding and crushing it
71:15 - in coding like seriously it's crazy but
71:17 - that's
71:18 - really what it is like rachel probably
71:20 - when you think of me as a developer you
71:22 - probably think i sit in front of a
71:23 - computer and then just like i just put
71:26 - on my hacker sunglasses and i just code
71:28 - all day
71:30 - never that has never happened it's so
71:32 - boring to look at me
71:34 - i'm like reading documentation i look
71:36 - like a lazy piece of i'm just like
71:38 - scrolling
71:39 - like drinking my perry
71:43 - sitting there like a lot of the day
71:46 - looks like i'm doing nothing
71:48 - and then something happens at the end
71:50 - and i'm like oh my god this is crazy
71:54 - some copy pasting worked
71:57 - so google power exactly
72:00 - so yeah hopefully that was worth the
72:02 - pain of
72:04 - showing it all right here we go yeah
72:08 - people are loving it they're like
72:10 - 15 coffee breaks sound good so much of
72:13 - my day is like
72:14 - let's go get a coffee i swear to god i
72:16 - almost break up my day in that
72:18 - so what about the coffee it's all about
72:20 - the coffee
72:24 - all right so let's move on to the next
72:27 - thing so we got the coffee covered and
72:30 - we got some of the google skills covered
72:32 - now what are some other important skills
72:35 - what are some important things that you
72:37 - need to have on your portfolio rachel
72:40 - well now we're into projects like as we
72:42 - just saw with jen and the power of that
72:44 - covet 19
72:45 - yes tracker projects
72:49 - especially what you guys have been doing
72:50 - on the live streams recently been going
72:52 - crazy
72:53 - we've been going crazy absolutely crazy
72:57 - i think um so even if we go to youtube i
73:01 - can actually like pull it up
73:02 - for everybody here like what we've been
73:04 - building but if you guys have been
73:06 - following over the last few days
73:09 - like have you been have you no do you
73:11 - know rachel what we have been building
73:12 - over the last few days
73:15 - yeah i've been i've been seeing all the
73:16 - different epic projects i mean you've
73:19 - done
73:20 - tik tok tinder youtube clone yep
73:24 - all kinds of craziness yeah so let me
73:27 - actually
73:28 - it's insane so guys take a look at this
73:31 - so hopefully everybody
73:32 - can see the screen but like literally
73:34 - yesterday
73:36 - holy crap the views are crazy on this
73:38 - one
73:39 - but yesterday we built the tick tock
73:41 - clone i don't know why my
73:44 - freaking annotation just decided to stop
73:46 - working and freeze
73:48 - um okay let me close out of a few things
73:53 - please work but i mean you can see it
73:56 - right rachel the tick tock clone
73:58 - yep yeah i mean we've even got the cover
74:00 - 19 tracker there the covet 19 tracker
74:03 - yup the youtube
74:04 - we actually started a show called dev's
74:05 - got talent i don't know if you know
74:07 - about that
74:08 - we're giving out prizes people are
74:09 - getting angry so so much fun
74:12 - um and here we got the tinder clone that
74:15 - we built
74:16 - which you guys can watch and learn from
74:18 - and just build these
74:19 - guys in the literally the last week if
74:21 - you if i keep going down
74:22 - we built a netflix clone we bit built
74:25 - amazon clone
74:26 - we built instagram clone uh we built
74:29 - tinder and tick tock clone and we're now
74:32 - going to be building these spotify
74:33 - clones soon
74:35 - just having some of these can get you a
74:38 - job on your portfolio
74:40 - imagine if you have all of these then
74:43 - i'm worried you might just be
74:44 - overqualified and you can't get a job
74:46 - anyway what do you think rachel
74:48 - right then i think you start getting the
74:51 - problem the other way
74:53 - because you'd imagine having all of
74:55 - those tangible projects yes
74:58 - that's crazy so for the world of
75:02 - developers
75:03 - like i think it will really help you to
75:05 - have
75:06 - projects and then have them on your
75:09 - portfolio
75:10 - and look rachel matt apparently made
75:12 - this slide
75:15 - apparently yeah
75:18 - so you guys you can put this on your
75:21 - portfolio
75:22 - and use that also to kind of get jobs
75:25 - and anything else rachel that's on your
75:27 - mind
75:29 - about freelancing and all of that just
75:32 - on the on the portfolio note
75:33 - um and obviously having that portfolio
75:36 - to make it easy and then having that
75:37 - really
75:38 - easily accessible on all your social
75:39 - media and all your platforms um
75:41 - like we talked about earlier yep
75:45 - make sure that's there and people can
75:46 - just hop in and see it so they can see
75:48 - your social they can see you put
75:49 - they can see your portfolio maybe you've
75:51 - sent them a video and then bam you've
75:52 - made such an amazing impression
75:55 - yeah because yeah because once they see
75:58 - your okay they see your video and
76:00 - they're like okay i'm
76:01 - pumped i want to know more about this
76:03 - person and then they see your portfolio
76:04 - and then they're like
76:05 - hey you've built like a bunch of
76:08 - projects and you can code too so you're
76:10 - not just bs'ing
76:11 - it's like real world stuff and you go
76:13 - okay cool that's the cool thing about
76:15 - coding and it's just like real you can
76:17 - actually hold it in your hands
76:18 - i mean virtually
76:22 - so
76:26 - let me actually just go ahead and do
76:27 - this awesome
76:30 - um i think this was phenomenal i think
76:32 - hopefully this provided a lot of value
76:34 - to everybody who's watched it
76:36 - how are you feeling rachel so far okay
76:39 - i'm feeling good i'm feeling good i hope
76:41 - it was helpful guys
76:44 - yeah guys if you thought that that was
76:46 - helpful or valuable to you just drop it
76:48 - in the comments below let us know
76:50 - if you've enjoyed what rachel put this
76:52 - together because guys rachel took a lot
76:53 - of time out of her day
76:55 - to put this together for you guys and
76:57 - she's here today and like
76:59 - working on it and she told you know her
77:02 - husband her kids to just leave her alone
77:03 - so she could do this for a little while
77:06 - so guys smash that like button for her
77:08 - and let's get this video going out to as
77:11 - many people as possible because if it
77:13 - provided you with value
77:14 - it's gonna provide other people with
77:16 - value as well so
77:18 - this was so huge rachel thanks so much
77:21 - for
77:22 - this you know this entire presentation i
77:24 - think this was tremendously helpful for
77:26 - people
77:27 - oh thank you and thank you everybody for
77:29 - being here we really appreciate it
77:31 - yeah awesome and yeah i mean if you guys
77:34 - want to see
77:35 - more of rachel's trainings let us know
77:38 - that as well
77:39 - i think rachel would um you know i don't
77:42 - know rachel what are you feeling like
77:43 - you
77:43 - she might want to come down next week or
77:45 - even the week after that to run a
77:47 - training
77:48 - uh i think that that was really exciting
77:50 - how are you feeling about that rachel
77:52 - okay i could make that happen
77:56 - yeah so crazy
78:00 - that full circle we started like we
78:02 - started
78:03 - you started being on the team from
78:05 - upwork
78:06 - now you're talking about upwork i think
78:10 - that's
78:10 - really freaking cool and i think that's
78:13 - real value for people because it's
78:14 - something real
78:15 - not just like you're talking about a
78:17 - platform that you didn't actually get
78:19 - paid from
78:20 - you know or you're talking about a
78:21 - platform that you have no idea
78:23 - about you know and so i think that's
78:27 - valuable i think the tips in this are
78:30 - really valuable for you guys
78:31 - if you actually start taking action on
78:33 - these because a lot of you will be like
78:35 - oh it's a cool idea to send videos oh
78:38 - it's a cool idea to personalize your
78:39 - message
78:40 - but then i'm going to look at your
78:42 - messages and it's going to be just copy
78:44 - pasted
78:45 - templates because that's the easy way
78:46 - out and there's going to be no video
78:48 - because that's also an easy way out and
78:51 - so
78:52 - if you want to take value
78:55 - from rachel by being here and instead of
78:58 - her
78:59 - spending three years to figure it out
79:00 - and then you spend three years to figure
79:02 - it out if you truly want to take value
79:04 - start
79:04 - actually taking action on what you
79:06 - learned here today
79:08 - so as of today make it a mission to go
79:11 - ahead
79:12 - and do something so here's what i want
79:13 - to do
79:15 - right now guys in the comments let drop
79:18 - below
79:19 - what action you're gonna take and commit
79:22 - to it and
79:23 - time bound it so i'll give you an
79:25 - example of a bad
79:26 - goal that you can set for this week a
79:29 - bad goal will be
79:31 - i definitely will learn more about
79:34 - freelancing that's an awful goal
79:38 - but if you set a goal and here's what a
79:40 - good goal will sound like
79:42 - and rachel you could help me with this
79:43 - too but what a good goal might sound
79:45 - like
79:46 - is i am going to do three
79:49 - i'm going to make a profile on upwork
79:53 - by today or
79:56 - by tomorrow i'm going to reach out to
80:00 - three people on upwork
80:03 - and i'm gonna do all of that by tomorrow
80:06 - so now it has a time
80:07 - it's time bound and it's very specific
80:10 - what you're gonna do
80:11 - what would you say rachel could could we
80:13 - make that better is that pretty good
80:16 - i think that's great i mean it's
80:17 - specific it's actionable it's what you
80:19 - can control you can
80:20 - you can do that outreach make the
80:21 - profile you've put a timestamp on it to
80:23 - give yourself a container
80:24 - so so much better yep so go ahead and
80:28 - start dropping below guys
80:30 - what are you going to be doing uh from
80:33 - this live stream today because i
80:35 - i like the views we like the likes you
80:37 - guys give this but what i really care
80:39 - about
80:40 - and what we care about the most is how
80:42 - many of you actually take action on it
80:44 - and do something that actually changes
80:46 - your life
80:47 - i think it's cool that you watch this
80:49 - video and it's super
80:50 - we're thankful for you but that's what
80:53 - truly matters right
80:55 - yeah i would love to see you get results
80:56 - i mean i can't believe that like from
80:58 - that
80:58 - upwork message two and a half years ago
81:00 - here we are so
81:01 - that's the power of taking action isn't
81:03 - it it's it's a massive massive
81:06 - power so definitely in the comments
81:09 - below you know drop
81:10 - you're gonna reach out to x amount of
81:12 - people make up upwork profile
81:14 - today and commit to that so drop that in
81:16 - the comments whether you want to do it
81:18 - on upwork or freelancer.com or
81:20 - fiverr.com the platform
81:21 - doesn't really matter that much the
81:23 - principles that rachel talked about
81:26 - will work for you on any of the
81:28 - platforms where you can
81:30 - do the outreach she gave you multiple
81:32 - resources like craigslist as well
81:34 - so there's no reason that today you
81:37 - shouldn't have a profile on upwork and
81:38 - now a lot of you're going to cry i got
81:40 - rejected by upworker then i stopped
81:41 - that's okay
81:42 - move on to craigslist make a job posting
81:46 - on craigslist nobody will reject you
81:48 - from craigslist
81:50 - do few things commit to them in the chat
81:53 - below and i want to start like reading
81:54 - out what you guys are going to be doing
81:56 - a little jackie actually says i have
81:58 - already earned 25 000
82:00 - using upwork that's awesome
82:03 - that's great amazing love hearing that
82:06 - let's see what's going on
82:08 - um evil namakian says i've already made
82:12 - hundreds of dollars
82:13 - um using flask that's great
82:17 - great job guys
82:20 - okay i'm gonna go ahead and start
82:22 - reading your guys's goals out now
82:29 - amanda says i'm going to create a upwork
82:32 - account today
82:33 - even though i was rejected once that's
82:35 - great pumped about that yeah way to go
82:39 - there's some there's somebody whose name
82:41 - is some guy
82:42 - and he says i'm on craigslist as we
82:44 - speak so i want you to make a job
82:47 - posting today
82:48 - on craigslist and do that probably right
82:51 - now actually
82:52 - the biggest hack i can give you for a
82:54 - job posting on craigslist
82:56 - is the first picture make it your
82:58 - picture and be smiling in it
83:00 - because you know craigslist allow you to
83:02 - post like 10 photos
83:04 - so use that and put your photo in there
83:10 - that's smart yeah
83:20 - will brush up my javascript this week
83:22 - all good that's okay i heard it rachel
83:23 - you can go that's fine
83:38 - i only see two good goals in the chat

Cleaned transcript:

today i am here with hey guys this is rachel guys this is gonna be a really fun one because rachel became part of our team when did you become part of the team rachel oh boy um it's been two and a half years now kazi two and a half years oh man that is that is amazing um i think was it january yep yeah january january 2018 you guys this is gonna be such an exciting one because rachel has been on the clever programmer team actually longer than anybody else right yeah yeah i think so now and in this video guys we're gonna be talking about the freelance developer guide 2020. this is what we have prepared for you and we're gonna go deep into all of this stuff and just so you guys i want to let you know you know if you're watching this is a replay or you're watching this right now guys rachel is also she is somebody who has made over 50 000 from freelancing in just one year uh from a platform like upwork and she's been doing freelancing for a while and we're going to be talking about all of that this is just to kind of preface what we're going to be covering but we're going to get into that in just a second now if you guys are excited about that and you guys want to hear rachel talk about this drop it in the comments below so rachel have you you know since we have started like have you been on what's the longest you've worked on a team or a job oh the longest on a team oh that's definitely um definitely a clever programmer really yep dang that is awesome so you're kind of like been freelancing for a real long time how long have you been freelancing for oh well i've been freelancing for three and a half years now wow since i yeah since i quit the old nine to five two and a half with clever programmer yep yeah guys so this is a really special one we call rachel our title for her at the team as protector of the realm if you guys are game of thrones fans you guys know what i'm talking about and that's how we see her she's been behind the scenes helping us with like pretty much everything like clever programmer a lot of the reason that actually exists is because of her you know um in 2018 there was like crazy stuff going on where pretty much clever programmer was about to end late 2018. you remember that like crazy things that were happening and rachel was there she stuck through thick and thin and like helped us really bring it back and then like propel clever programmer to another level and if i didn't have that sanity and that voice of reason at that time guys a lot of this today would not exist so i'm i'm really personally just pumped to have her here and i hope you guys are also excited to have her and hear her out one thing i want to say is that there are going to be tons and tons of value bombs in this presentation that rachel has prepared for you guys so just make sure that you have a notebook you're ready to pay attention listen up and in the comments if you're watching this live which you are right now make sure that you have questions and thoughtful questions drop them in and we're also going to go and answer those for you guys so we make it as easy for you as possible but just remember you're going to be getting a lot of value out of this freelance developer guide that we have put together and again it's from somebody who has been doing freelancing and honestly for doing it over a period of three and a half years and somebody who's made well over fifty thousand dollars and almost kind of like working parttime and having our own lifestyle and you're a mother of two kids right yep two kids one baby one one fiveyearold yeah and what's amazing about you rachel is most of the times i thought when you have kids you can't really do anything in life but you are somebody who has kids but then you're also super high performing and you're very critical thinking and then you're also doing so much growth with you're finding waste time to read books right like you're finding time to actually grow and selfreflect and improve and add value to the business as well yeah absolutely i think if anything kind of having kids has done the opposite for me in that it's like i really treasure that any time that i can put into personal growth i go all in on it um and i have to be super productive and high performing with with my work time plus it gives you that big big incentive obviously to like perform the best you can for them as well as yourself yeah i mean that's really amazing i don't see that with many other people honestly but it's really cool to see that with you and it's kind of inspiring it's like hey life doesn't just end when you have kids it actually can help propel you forward okay with that said let's jump right into it so freelance developer guy 2020 and rachel is gonna talk about all of these things so rachel i'm gonna have you take it away from here i'm gonna be here helping you along the way but i'm gonna go hit the next slide and then you can take it from here okay hey guys so um yeah first up the most crucial thing i think when you're starting as a freelancer especially is mindset getting your mind in the right place now i've tagged this up because um sunny and frankie did an epic video like back last week and there's a big section in that especially on mindset that speaks to a lot of um a lot of things that you'll find really useful but just getting your mind in the right place and having that attitude before you begin is it's crucial um and there are there are loads of things you can do though that will help you with that and yeah when if you could check that video out um yeah there are some really great tips yeah you're talking about the video with frankie and sonny yeah guys like that's a great video on mindset and yeah i think that's what you're referring to right that video yeah yeah that's the one yeah awesome we have some nice comments coming in people are like rachel is such an amazing human being uh yes we want to hear from rachel uh people are amanat is like we got rachel in the house yusuf says yeah rage in the house rocket girl yeah this is like this is special right now this is special because i mean i'm honestly i'm the i'm one of the biggest fans of just you as a human being so i i'm just pumped that we're actually on here and have the time to actually talk but it's kind of like disguised as we're creating content but it's also providing value to everybody you know so that's kind of fun i love it i love it okay so with the have an end goal in mind now what do you think about this you know with the skills and then making an income and are you able to see my screen right yes yeah okay i can see your screen yeah i think um i think that yeah that end goal is so so crucial in setting up the vision for what you want to create when you start freelancing so um be that a financial goal um that you can then reverse engineer um maybe you want to leave maybe you want to leave a ninetofive job or move to freelancing maybe it's that you want to switch to a junior developer job whatever that might you know whatever that might be yep freelancing um just having an end goal that you're clear on and you can really keep in the back of your mind um and break down into the skills that you want to learn how you're going to earn that money yeah and then how you're going to go about getting the clients you know yep agreed agreed so that's great and now speak to us a little bit about on the salaries that developers can be making you know whether it's a frontend developer or backend developer excuse me sorry i'm just gonna drink oh good like guys these are no joke salaries that most developers you know whether you're depending on whatever level you're at and for you to be able to make this much that is really powerful and most of these you can actually do it from different parts of the world right rachel yep yeah absolutely absolutely and that's that's the beauty of being able to work remotely too yep awesome so here we're looking at 99 000 potential salary for a frontend developer and then what is it looking like for a backend developer so backend developer right up there with the 121443 dang that's a big number that's a big number yeah and you know if you whether you want to be a backend developer frontend developer you can be making a lot of salary again it depends on your skill set and like you know rachel said in the start disclaimer hard work required so you can't just do it kind of out of nowhere you do have to put in the work and of course if you're a full stack developer you can be looking in a similar range as well okay i'm going to move on go ahead rachel okay so um just looking now more specifically at how you how you go about getting clients and setting yourself up with a strategy um so especially for me when i first started freelancing and i was still in the 95 situation the first thing i did set up your defense so you want that really clear online presence um that people can see when you start interacting um and you start hanging out networking online and looking for work so be that um social media platforms upwork um if you could hop onto the next one kazi um i i want to actually add on to what you're saying here uh rachel is and i'm sorry i'm cutting you off just a little bit but no it's grand i remember that even when you started working with clever programmer and you the initial interview took place from upwork uh we got on a call and you crushed it during the interview process i was asking you so many like questions it's like hey how would you you know if you have to create an email marketing sequence and tag it and you were able to answer all questions technically and i was i remember once i got off the call i was so excited but one thing that i did do that really sealed the deal for me is i found your facebook profile and then i was going through your facebook profile and even though you weren't getting like thousands of likes or thousands of shares like it didn't matter your facebook i went through your facebook profile and i would see you posting stuff that would literally have zero likes and zero comments sometimes and it would be like hey going into the rabbit hole of learning about you know convertkit or going into the rabbit hole of learning about like some other technology or something and i thought man this is the person we want who is so excited about it is that in their free time they're sharing these resources on their social media profile that was a huge thing for us when like at least for me mentally for me to decide actually even working with you and i think that could be useful for you guys for watching this you can build out your social media profiles even if they're not getting that many views because a job employer might actually look at it and see where your passions are right rachel yeah absolutely i remember that really well and it doesn't you don't even have to over complicate i think it was just a couple of simple posts i mean you can put graphics together in things like canva yeah um so it's so simple to set that up um i remember remember when you're talking about i think it was a wordpress theme salient that you built one of your websites on yeah yeah um but yeah that's it and it just just gives you that little corner of the internet where somebody can go and just get an impression of you what you're enthusiastic about um it gives them an insight into your technical skills without you having to say it it's just that the proof is there yeah it's it's the proof for sure so what are we looking at here okay so i think there's just a few simple things with that social media presence um that can really set you up for success um one thing i'd say is obviously prioritize the platforms that you actually enjoy spending time on so yeah if you're heavy on facebook or there are groups in facebook that there might be potential clients then make sure that you set that profile up um so it's easy to reach out to you um to find out how to work with you to see what your skills are and get a really quick simple idea of you um because you never know when somebody's looking you could be networking in a group and somebody just want to click on your little stalk and you want to make sure that platform is there um also what i find really good is to just keep certain things consistent if you've got different different different profiles things like a headshot so if you're using a headshot um and yeah talk with headshots specifically i think that's something that's really worth putting a little bit of time into to make sure you've got a good picture of your face so people can really so people can and a nice smile yeah yeah because people will make that decision sometimes within a few seconds yep we just got our first donation actually thank you so much gaming with wizard and uh we're gonna take your questions later but he says hey i'm not getting clients give me a suggestion and that's what we're going to do in this video okay so keep watching and we're going to give you tons of suggestions and ideas so keeping profile headshots and things like that consistent across and also making sure that they're good right like smiling i think is really happy really important because when people look sad or depressed i don't want to work with them you know you don't want to work with you because you're like either this person is going to be condescending or they're going to be patronizing or there's going to be something weird about this person i don't want to work with them but having like i'm not yeah it's crazy how much that smile actually how long of a wait goes so if you guys are watching this literally it can make the difference between eighty thousand dollars being in your bank account in one or two years versus five thousand dollars being in your bank account you know it's like it's crazy it's not just a smile but like it has that much of an impact sometimes you know i took a great photo of my friend tenzin and he ended up getting a client and i'm not gonna reveal their name but he got a client that were they were billionaires they were literally billionaires uh so he would be able to go and hang out with them and they would just pay him like five thousand four thousand to five thousand a week for literally just hanging out with them and that was his social media presence it was the photo it was the words that he had there it just can't be emphasized enough yeah so true so true and you just set it up once you've done it once and you've put the investment in then it's just there serving you nice people love smiling logan says a smile resembles happy energy you want to work with happy people getting some comments and from people that i'm reading out loud that maybe you don't see right now um awesome now here is somebody who we know who is this rachel here is amanath as a shiny example of a beautiful social media feed and especially i mean ours has been a student of ours for a few months now um and we've just seen him progress um and he's a machine with his social media yeah i mean he is even actually you know sunny is paying him to also manage his social media wow yeah and i'm thinking about hiring him actually um yeah and he came he came to our attention largely through instagram so it goes a long way doesn't it such a long way it's huge yeah big um i mean and his social media profile is so good that if you're an employer and he's interviewing and you're looking at it i mean that will be you will very likely hire him honestly because you will go like this is actually even more powerful than a resume in some ways right because you can't lie on this you know what i mean like he's been posting something for what over you know the last 10 20 30 40 50 days you know because on resume i can lie and say all kinds of crazy claims but this is like who i am and how i think on a daily basis man yeah that's so true because the consistency just speaks for itself doesn't it um i mean the content is there you can see the attention to detail you can see so many things about that person just from a look at their social media feed yep seriously he's actually in the chat right now and he's like oh thank you yeah yeah so guys actually go check out his profile and even check out his copy like let me actually see if i can find amanoth's instagram and pull it up here so let me see if i can find it but that is a huge let me see um yep there we go so i think we found it and i just shared it with everybody but if you guys take a look at the stuff that he's posting and you even read his copy right i can tell what type of person he is we keep moving forward opening new doors and open doing new things because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths walt disney day six a day 36 out of 37 and then he goes hey guys just wanted to share some knowledge on git git was developed by linus tor walls blah blah blah he goes on now if i am hiring this person i'm literally thinking man this person will change the culture in our business like if i have other software developers there he will boost their productivity so a software developer that you know let's say he's doing his 5x but then with the monoth on the team that developer will go from 5x to like 10x so yeah absolutely just brings so much energy right yeah so as a ceo or as an owner like a business owner i'm constantly will be thinking about how he will like the roi is like so there in my mind the value is so there and i want a person like this who when they learn they're hungry then share that knowledge with everybody around them so of course i will look at his resume of course i will take a look at his skills but this would just give him such a huge plus in my opinion yeah yeah absolutely that's it i think if he's connecting with people on instagram directly as well yeah then you know you never know who's seeing those posts um if he's out reaching out to people directly they're just going to take a quick look at this profile and wow yup really says so much it it really really does so okay i'm gonna so go ahead what's going on here okay so this was just um a quick check for setting up those profiles and making it super easy for people to actually they've checked you out they think yep i really want to take the next step with this person i want to book a call i want to work with them just make it as easy as possible so on facebook you've got things like the book now button um they'll link right through to your calendar if you've got a portfolio you obviously want to make that sure that's in there i mean these sound like basic things but so often you don't see them um and that means that they've gone on to the next person you know yep i see i see a multiple things here i see your new website is live and you've pinned it right yep i see that you even have a book me here so i can actually be able to book a call with you that's important um yep this is this is really valuable okay that's it right and that's what people will see when they click straight through from your personal profile yeah so you want to just make it as easy and frictionless as possible yep so got a comment here by sachin and he says seriously i find this totally not required and it's funny because he's misspelling the whole thing the whole time so i'll read it in his words seriously i find this tota totally not required it's misspelled beatifying your insta so that clients will think about you social life is supposed to be private and up to that person to share it with others now that's a pretty valid point but i think such and you're missing a very big point here and guys let me know what you guys think in the comments below as well because we are reading uh all of what you guys are saying as well but here's what i will say you could if you want to just make your social media profile completely private that's okay that's up to you but if you want to actually leverage it to grow your business and grow your brand and be able to get a higher paying salary which affects your personal life right like the fact that rachel can use her social media profile and then is able to generate an income with it she can provide for her family she doesn't have to worry about a ton of things like what happens if somebody around me like loses my job she doesn't have to worry about that so it actually has a huge impact on your life so you can see it as two different ways i see it as why not if you have the option to leverage it if you have the option to be able to use it to kind of further your life why would you not and and what are your thoughts on this rachel yeah i totally agree and i think i mean there's also the option of course if you did want to kind of have a private um a private life you could have you could set up a dedicated page especially with something like instagram yes um if it was privacy it was the question if that was the question then you could have a dedicated page where you didn't share your private life as much but you could still put the work in and share that handle yeah um i think that's an option also when you talk about beautifying it i get you but i mean i think it's not so much about how it looks it's more that it's easy to see all of that really practical content like when you looked into it that shows so much about um amino's craftsmanship with how he puts his posts together his skill sets um his consistency i think it's about a lot more than the aesthetic but i totally hear you because if you're about to hire somebody you want to be able to see their consistency you always you want to be able to see their thought process so remember remember we didn't just look at it and go he has pretty photos on here because i think anybody can do that we're really looking at everything just like for example the fact that i'm looking at you're constantly misspelling everything that would make me actually not hire you like like literally you know what i mean so if that's the case actually social media could hurt you in this case but if you are using it in a good way and you are using it to share value with other people that's what i care about and that's what most business owners care about that you're providing value to people so i think it's a massive plus i mean think about the reason why you're here right now right like why are you here on this stream right now it's because we are providing you value we have a beautiful thumbnail with a beautiful title of make money with programming you are in to get value out of that and you are here and we're currently like 20 minutes or 30 minutes in it's because it's bringing you value in some type of way so as long as your guys's north star is bringing value not beauty that will really really help you so even when i'm seeing a lot of the profile you know of rachel or when you know we're going through our hiring process and when we're looking at amanath we're able to see that you're providing value and we want that person on the team that's providing value like before they even have a job yep so just my two cents okay all right so okay should we move on to the next one rachel yeah absolutely nice okay so talk to us about this slides that i put in yeah i think such such a good point though isn't it um yeah i like it like you were saying about the value that your potential employer client will get from um seeing your personal growth in your thought process if you've got that if you've got those posts that give an insight into um especially things like how invested you are and how you take on feedback you know there's so much that you can you can tell as a story in in in that social media yep 100 percent so documenting your even right now i'm you know amanath is not saying he's an expert he is basically saying hey i'm on day 36 out of day 70. he's just telling the truth and if somebody's looking to hire maybe they're looking for an intern that might be a perfect fit they're looking for somebody who's willing to learn fast might be a great fit for them logan says if you want to separate your work and your personal on instagram just make a second account and direct your followers kind of what rachel you were saying a little bit earlier and then ziad says he says i think if your profile is private no one will know who you are and i don't think you'll be able to grow your business so have two profiles one private and the other one for your business so i think that could be also another good way to go yeah for sure um awesome uh oshea says this means a lot thank you so much and can't agree more and what you and rachel have just said so awesome job rachel we're we're crushing it thank you and yeah even document the failures you know if something is bad or like your code is not working or a project is broken broken you can even share that that's actually helpful okay so it's so so helpful right and that just shows so much about character i think that speaks to what you were just saying cassie about value yeah um is that i know i don't know what you'd say but when you're higher in the first thing you're looking to is that character yep character traits the skills skill can be trained yes and taught but the character that's that's what you want to put across and it's such a good way to do that it's so it's such a good way to do that because most people are trained for answers like hey what's your biggest weakness and they're like honesty you know biggest weakness i'm just too honest or like what's your biggest biggest weakness i'm too hardworking and so you don't want those people on your i literally had to end the interview with some people and be like okay all right thank you so much for coming in but and i ended the interview because they um there's so much like politics built into them you don't want people to bring in politics or circular type of answers to the business or the culture that's actually poison and so a lot of us are actually trained wrong you would rather be at the interview and just say i don't know but i can figure it out like i'll i can get back to you tonight on it you would much rather have that so you can just that's why documenting your failures can be a very great sign of your overall characteristics as a human being because they're hiring the human yeah yeah definitely it speaks so much to your character doesn't it yeah awesome okay so what's up with the call booking okay so i'd say with zoom a lot a lot of people are probably already on the case there with kovid and everything being online now um but just making sure that you've got those basics like you've got a zoom account ready um and you've got calendly um just as a as a great service for having your cat you can put your calendar on there um people can book in specific times with you um i think there's even a paid option if you're doing things like coaching and oneoff freelancers where it's so straightforward yep they're booking the page done so just making things as simple as possible yep and getting those optimized yep and i don't have to with calendly you know you and i don't have to keep having a back and forth on like what's a good time for you 6 p.m doesn't work for me but can we do 7 30 p.m no that doesn't work for me can we do you know what i mean and like then only to realize that comes exactly i'm just gonna say only to realize i was talking pst and you were talking like uk time and eight hour difference with calendly we don't have to do that you can just send somebody a thing and then they can just book your free availability so you know i think for freelancers or people who want to freelance i think guys this can be a really important resource for you because if you want to set up an interview with somebody right rachel like your potential employer you don't want to have them like chasing around you trying to book a time you want to make it an easy process for them oh yeah absolutely you want to make it as easy as possible so that they just get it done like you said yeah totally totally and you avoid doing the time zone dance yes so yeah definitely avoid that dance because it's not good for anybody so great so get get these things and get comfortable with calendly get comfortable with zoom i mean i would say even learn like annotating in zoom like how i'm annotating so much yeah okay so that's it i mean they're free they're both free you can just get them you can play around with them you can get really comfortable for them for when you start needing them yes exactly all right so let's move on to the next one okay so next step so you you want to set up what we call in your defense first so you want to get your profiles ready um on the different platforms that you're going to use your own your own personal social media um and then it's time to go love clients so the way that i did it was just to kind of systemize it especially to kind of make it nonoverwhelming just create a system um every day to do certain actions and go out and make sure that i was doing things that would help me move towards getting clients um so if you want to hop onto the next one causey sure thing i'll show you the actual tool in a minute um but yeah if you want to start with your research and i know you've talked a lot carly about specific platforms that are good um just so many so many places that you could be looking but you basically want to make a list of say upwork people per hour there are various slack communities where your ideal clients might be hanging out facebook groups yep um in person meetups online meetups yep just i'd say the very first thing i did was get that list get it all together and have it ready for every time that i wanted to go out and look for potential clients yeah um then off the back of that um it was to um to hop onto the next one next slide please yeah cool cool yeah you can just say next that's fine okay thank you um oh next again that's just a little nice little dance twostep dance so there we go so this is just um one example of a tool there i mean there are plenty out there that you can use this one's called um meister task or there's trello that a lot of people probably use so say that again what is this one called this is called meister task ah yeah yeah yeah i've heard of this okay so let me actually write that meister task that's what the tool cool and it's it free um yeah yeah i'm pretty sure the basic level is free okay cool got it go ahead i mean trello is really similar um but this yeah this is the first step at kind of creating a system so to have this board there um carve out time and in those time blocks to um which i'll come on to in a moment but in those time blocks go out and look for clients and then use this as like your hub of who you've spoken to so that when you're when you're out there and you're chatting to people um or you've sent off an application on upwork you can remember what you've done and you can follow them up so you'd pop everybody into the potential clients as much information as you could um but you could also use something like this is if you're kind of really proactively reaching out to people that you would like to work with like say you kazi um say somebody was thinking i really wanted to be on the cp team yep they'd add clever programmer in there as a potential client then you'd go out and you'd just get as much information about that company and about cars as you could that would really help you how to reach out um the email addresses instagram handles various different ways that you can get in touch pop it all on a card in there and then off you go you've got those people to start tackling when you're when you're out there and you're starting to try and get momentum yep got it that is huge i think that is a great way to put it and you're very systematic with this so i think like maybe we should bring you on one time to even do like an actual tutorial of how you use these how you use these tools i think that will be actually really valuable to people if that would be valuable to you guys do drop it in the comments below because rachel has she's very systematic she's very analytical and she's very good with systems and processes so things like following up reaching out and having a solid way to go about it i think that could be pretty valuable for everybody we got also one super donation so thank you so much for that and actually just right now we got another one by conscious code so rachel people are loving this and um let's see what he said he says hey i'm done well versed with data structures and algorithms in c plus i want to move to web development i have no idea about web how can i start i'm confused with the technologies how to start you are in the right place you should really just watch this channel and even the live stream builds that we're doing do those with us and they literally show you how to build your portfolio and then how you can land your job so even tomorrow we're going to be building a spotify clone so actually guys i do want to let you know tomorrow we're building a spotify clone right here on this channel and that will be pretty mindblowing so if you are excited about that put it in your calendars like literally set up alarms for it and let me know that you're registered for the spotify training i'm going to give you a shout out but put it in your calendar put set up alarms for it it's going to be 10 15 a.m monday pacific time los angeles time again 10 15 a.m and we're gonna be building spotify from scratch so it's getting pretty wild make sure you're there and if you're here right now guys what can you do to make sure this video goes out to everybody rachel what can they do to make sure this video goes out to everybody and it doesn't cost them anything i'm sorry i lost you what can they do rachel right now to make sure this video goes out to everybody and it doesn't cost them anything oh hit the like button please i didn't say it this time guys rachel said it go smash that like button and it make sure that this if you're have if you're getting value from this this will just spread send it out to so many people and we just work really hard to prepare all these trainings for you guys and by just hitting that one button helps us so much you won't even believe so please go ahead and do that and with that said let's jump right back into the training yeah for sure and i mean if if if you guys think it would be helpful i can totally go into this in more detail um in another training but yeah the gist of it then um is you can also obviously see who you need to follow up so i think that's so that it's so easy to slip through the cracks to send something off and not do a followup but if you've got it all here in black and white that can be really effective yep yeah um awesome so let's go on to the next slide so what's okay so go ahead take it away rachel okay so um conferences so we just thinking here of just really opening your mind to all of the different opportunities there are to meet people that you could potentially be your clients um i mean we've talked a lot about the online places that you can be but of course in person yeah um and even even digitally you know that now a lot of the conferences are going online at the moment aren't they yep in person yeah in person is a little bit tricky for now but a lot of these conferences are online so you can still network with likeminded people in the same way and you just never know who you're going to meet i know you've seen a lot of success at conferences haven't you crazy oh yeah tons of success at conferences literally last conference we went to you know we closed somebody for five thousand dollars right there at the conference like literally before leaving the conference and i think we had paid three thousand to book the hotels and take frankie and aaron with me to the conference so we got our we got that up front and then daniel joined our team and then he ended up closing multiple people on our high ticket program so just that conference alone directly made us over ten thousand dollars in like cash today so conferences are killer you guys they're super powerful but again with covet i think that's going to be a little tricky a little tricky but online you know there's so much online there are a lot of the online summits and there are still a lot of those places you can find where these people are hanging out yep 100 okay so let's go on to the next one go ahead okay so this was just kind of speaking to this tripping over specifics of um of that outreach so you just want to kind of try and especially if you're a little bit off put by the idea of reaching out to people just turn it into a habit so block out time on the calendar put it on there every day maybe every day at the same time um and then go in there um have your list of who you're gonna reach out to all of the different places so if you're anything like me then your brain isn't distracted with too many options yeah um and excuses because you've got everything else you can go to your list and go okay i'm gonna try upwork i'm gonna go to go to the facebook groups and look for look where people american connect with um i'm gonna think about conferences i'm gonna look at my board and see who i can follow up with who i can reach out to i've been admiring for some time you know you've got all of those options and you've got that time specifically kind of scheduled out to make sure that it's something that becomes a habit yep yep i think yeah making it a habit i think is a really important point where almost like you're not even that emotional about it you just do it as a discipline at some point you know yeah i think that's that way of building relationships is important yeah yeah definitely definitely i think especially if the idea is is overwhelming initially um to some people like and then if you hop to the next one causey sure um something i found really good if if that is you too is the pomodoro technique and i know that's traditionally more of a kind of time management strategy but the way i've always always used it for outreach was okay i'm gonna set this timer i'm gonna put aside especially any of you know the negative the selftalk and the imposter syndrome i'm just gonna check that out at the door for a minute i'm gonna stop thinking about the distractions like the kids and the washing and you know but you set that timer and in that time you're in the zone and you're gonna fully promote yourself you know that's where you're gonna put your energy turn up best foot forward and off you go that's actually really great advice to like actually just have a pomodoro timer and it's about 25 20 minute timer and then just focus on doing the outreach and then after that you're just done yep but like laser focus and john sonmez in his book soft skills talks about this technique as well i think it's a powerful technique to your point about the conferences amanda says there's a lot of conferences happening online right now he says i attended a few conferences during this lockdown and i met a lot of cool people from google and major companies and was able to talk to them wow that's so powerful isn't it that's huge that's that's really huge um and again this is also from the last i think webinar frankie was talking about this as well on the pomodoro but guys like finding your learning style is important and you know time management productivity hacks like pomodoro are really really helpful and then rachel i also want to hear your thoughts on being able to handle stress and anxiety through things like meditation or anything else yeah for sure so i think um a lot of that well a lot of that is kind of tied in with what we were just talking about with the outreach and having a kind of specific system around it when you're especially when you're really keen that you want to get things moving um if that's overwhelming having some kind of system helps but also for me things that have been really great for um handing them are just like making sure that you you know you look after yourself the normal stuff the exercise keep keeping your energy up meditation um and i think a gratitude practice is a really good a really good um one to adopt as well yep agreed yeah uh gratitude practice even tony robbins talks about that a lot um yeah yeah so let's go on my bad my bad you can finish your thoughts that's okay i was just gonna i was just gonna say that um i mean even especially if you're reaching out um reaching out to clients taking those few minutes to um make sure that you're in kind of try and shift yourself from what might be a stress or anxious state to a positive one could be huge in in terms of results that you get as well just taking that time maybe you do a meditation maybe you maybe journaling works for you putting on a music that changes your state doing some jumping jacks hitting something whatever it is that does that for you yeah i think that that is definitely really like some people even have those tiny trampolines in their house have you ever seen those epic webs says for me the stress slash anxiety is also addressed by trying to hide your failures as mentioned previously be honest and don't worry about asking other people for help oh so true so that is really really huge and yeah i think those things are really important they set your foundation really really right yeah now moving on talk to us about like personalize your messages okay so this is um this is where we met kazi oh this is actually holy crap this is actually your real message to me the first one actual first one yep yep there was a kind of um a little proposal that goes with it but this was the cover letter so this is what i sent to try and stand out when i saw your your the job application and now you've been working with us for what two point first ever message and now this is so cool this is so cool you guys like the fact that and now she's been working with us for two and a half years at cp that's insane like that is one of the coolest things i mean nobody i've never seen a training like this like this is so cool that we can talk about this it's crazy right yeah that is insane go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks to how much power there is in um just really putting some effort into the right kind of job application or whatever whatever way that you're reaching out to people putting some thought into it doing your research on who the other person is um really taking your time and especially on platforms like at work you see a lot of copy and pastes yes you know oh my god people just they just apply for this every all these jobs with the same thing it doesn't speak to your own application to the skills to the character which if you can just take that time to really um really hone in on what they're asking for um because i mean all the time to your point i would get these like garbage messages on upwork and just like hey really interesting project you have there i could definitely help you and then blah blah and i'm like that's your what 104th copy paste of the day you know yeah and so when i saw a message like yours it was extremely refreshing to see somebody who actually read what we had written and wrote specifically for that so like what rachel is saying is like guys stop using canned messages when you reach out to these platforms it's not a game of volume it's a game of like reaching out with quality yeah yeah oh totally totally um and i want to even read out your message because i think it's really important you guys could even use this as a template so rachel reached down and she said hi there and she goes i really enjoyed reading your job posting and it would be awesome to chat with you about whether i'd be a good fit for the role honestly when i read this i thought it was like a canned message probably you know most likely because that's what i got from a lot of people but then this is where i got interested i love problem solving and getting tech tools to work together my background is ten years in accountancy and admin but six months ago i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal work is in problem solving so here she said problem solving love problem solving in my initial job posting i had mentioned problem solving multiple times um yeah i think i've popped the post a little further down as well causey so it's there in case yeah oh yeah that's awesome we can actually take a look at that too um oh wow even amanat is he's like um he's this letter is amazing i've never thought of writing a letter like that finally wishing i'm good this is awesome so here um so i've got experience in leadpages and various email webinar payment course systems these specific systems we were talking about but not kajabi and this is honestly one of those things that kind of just like hits you in the heart like this was one of the things where i'm like not only do we not have somebody who's possibly really good at it but the fact that she says openly she doesn't know kajabi and not like some wishywashy answer like literally she's like not kajabi that is huge because already i can tell so much about her character and integrity and i want to work with somebody on the team who has character and integrity i don't want to work with people who put politics above everything else right so going on and she goes yet i'm really keen to learn all of these systems so that's important to me that she's very flexible and so would be very happy in my element in fact to learn them quickly and on my own time like that is just beautifully written it's like somebody's dream to have somebody like that working on their team where they're like hey i would i don't know them this is actually funny right because at the start of this video that's what i said if you don't know it just say it and say i'll be able to willing to learn later literally what you say here and um we have messages that are like joseph says uh this is a working template nice one rachel o'shea says rachel's letter is perfect it's brief specific and detailed really good job so that lucy says this is so useful asan says eloquent amazing job says amanath abdullah says yeah rachel amazing job no thanks guys yeah seriously it's actually really amazing and then she goes i love research and have found some great resources so i can quickly get familiar with them i pride myself in being proactive a strong communicator and a great team player honestly this statement i trust if anybody else says it i would just ignore it but like do you guys know what makes me want to trust this statement more like what out of this entire thing what was it that makes me actually trust this statement more and if you want to guess drop it in the comments below but for me it was actually this statement where she just openly is so honest and willing to say i don't know kajabi and then when you say you pride yourself in being a strong communicator and great team player i trust you see what i'm saying yeah yeah like because i'm like okay i she why would you say that if you were somebody who was just lying you know because you literally went out of your way to say you didn't know something yeah yep um abdullah says amazing tips thanks for the advice sure says this is nice um we have everything ipad pro says the way she writes is just beautiful yeah minik says i've never thought of writing such a thing this is awesome yep and then she even goes on to say look forward to hearing from you if you'd like to discuss more and best of luck with finding someone awesome i mean who goes out of their way to even encourage you and be happy for you to find somebody else that's awesome ending on such a positive note is another huge thing everything eyepatch pro says rachel is an independent and strong woman and uh she's proud of you oh thank you yeah yeah and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had a really nice message to this and he says he said the letter is amazing i've never thought of writing such a letter finally wishing them and and he goes you finally wishing somebody good luck and finding that is this seriously shows the mindset of rachel so so that's yeah so that's huge because it shows where her mindset is and this is the letter that like resulted in i don't know fifty thousand dollars and more like i don't know i don't even know at this point how where we're at but like this is literally has led to over a fifty thousand dollar transaction and probably we're gonna work until many many more years like we like literally i would love to have rachel on the team for the next three five ten years on clever programmer and it all came from right here so it doesn't really get any more real than this yep pretty crazy that's crazy right you never thought one day your letter that you were gonna write was gonna be like broadcasted to thousands of people no i really didn't oh man i think you're right you're right it just shows the power of taking that time taking that time to really stop um stop think put yourself in the other person's shoes as to what they're looking for and yeah and like like we were talking about to put yourself in the right state when you're when you're approaching it as well you know put make sure you're in that positive place where you can write it with like all of the enthusiasm and best intentions and then you know let go yes yep john ford says rachel is a true professional her work her insta profile and this letter now everything speaks about how cool and good at her work she is simply amazing be like rachel no damn and o'shea says it takes just one good letter to change your life yep and uh kringet says nice message it's awesome the whole thing especially about being honest yep so i mean yeah this is something that's really valuable if you guys want to take a screenshot of this before we move on go ahead and do that it'll give you kind of like a template but again her whole point is personalized yeah yeah totally but even within personalization this is a good template to kind of work off of uh so what else rachel before we move on to the next slide yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking about how important personalizing is but there's a little note there about um a swipe file and by that what i mean is not copy and paste in um the same thing to every job but just having a couple of notes um if you know if you're doing a lot of outreach um you're reaching out to quite a few people that you're really interested in just having a little kind of swipe file of phrases that explain your skills that you can still word in from so you don't put too much mental energy into that that's unnecessary i think that's something that's quite handy too yep a hundred percent so definitely use have those handy so that you can use them as reference and then grow like leverage them to be be able to write but guys yeah this is something that's really important it shows you it's not so much praying spray and just like reach out to 5 000 locations you can if you spend more time and you reach out with precision your success rate honestly is going to be much higher don't overthink it as well like don't spend three hours on a message but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10 or 10 minutes personalizing write it and move on that would be really good yeah awesome so asa ali says i'm about to start my first freelancing job this is really helpful you guys deserve a lot thank you guys awesome congratulations yeah uh tam mayor tim marlon says rachel i would want you to teach me writing true and very like detailed messages like these that's cool how to have a chat with you awesome okay so let's keep it moving so let's go on to the next one and uh this was the actual job posting right mmhmm yeah yep so this is the job posting go ahead i'm just gonna say we just cut it up so yep that's it so yeah this is the posting guys this is part like this is you know the first part of it this is the second part of it it's the same posting we have we just cut it up so it's all on the same page but like uh my main thing we were looking for was people who knew about all these technologies kajabi drip click funnel sam cart webinar jams zapier but i said like we need someone who can manage these systems understand how they work and be able to do it and i wrote some specific things like you should be able to understand what we mean when we say xyz and if you don't know this you'd love to research it until you understand how it works and can put it together so you know going back and here i mentioned kajabi and going back to what rachel said she said in her message that she doesn't know kajabi but she's willing to learn it right and so she also understood like where i was coming from and then she mentioned that and she said i'd be willing to learn so it matches up to kind of what we were looking for and we said the right person will be confident in his his slash her intuition to figure out figure it out and get the job done correctly you may not know every platform but this is a type of work that makes you feel invincible and you are smart enough to figure it out and definitely when i spoke with rachel she already knew a lot of things and what she didn't know she said she would be willing to learn and then when i went on her social media on her facebook it confirmed with me she that she wasn't just saying words to say whatever she needed to say to get a job she was backing it up with her actions and i could see three months ago she was like posting about going down rabbit holes and learning about technology yeah so that was huge cool go ahead and remember also with that kazee right at the end of the requirements um and it said you wanted a minimum of two plus years handson administrative support experience oh yeah yeah yeah so and i know things like that would sometimes put people off with the specifics oh yeah that was just complete like i don't even know what that meant i just put that i had no idea what that even meant i don't even what is administrative support i have i had no idea exactly so it's always it's always worth it's always worth applying to something if you read it and you think yes and you connect you know even if there's something like that yeah so i mean like it also goes to show you that like and you didn't have that right just to be clear you didn't have two plus years of handson how much did you have um i think gosh six months to a year maybe at that point yeah so so basically another thing like don't say no for the other person yeah so like she she could have easily just said oh i don't have two years of experience i'm not gonna apply for this but she's just like she she applied for it anyway and it turns out that i was an idiot and i didn't even know what the hell i was looking for and i just put some random stuff in requirements and a lot of people who are looking like a lot of people who are actually posting these jobs from the hr department they even have no idea what the specs are yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you put it so well they're not saying no for them yeah so don't say no for them apply anyway intelligently and don't don't have those weird things put you off you know like um i saw this one post where the developer of the react.js library or something along those lines something really massive got rejected from a job and because they wanted like 10 years of experience and he says i have five years of experience or something along those lines and they're like sorry we need somebody with ten and then he made a tweet he says well i got rejected from a job but he goes i wrote the react.js library and it's only been out for five years oh wow so i was like oh wow so somebody can correct me in the chat below it's not really react and it's not the same time frame but the point is similar yeah so you know it's it's crazy but yeah all right moving on so what is going on here with this guy now this this guy's hiding from video oh no yeah i think the the one thing the other one thing i'd maybe do a little differently now um if i was kind of actively looking on that point right now is i would add in video so and in addition to because people like different platforms in addition to that written um message that i sent i would probably make a really short video just so that you can really connect with the other person because video's so powerful game changer so i think if you hop to the next one kazi um yeah we're just talking about loom there um and i mean even when you're working with clients like there's an example there um this is loom if anybody hasn't used it before it's a free tool yep and here's your face this is a video here's her face talking over it and then she's sharing her screen but keep going rachel yeah yeah exactly this is me talking about something in one of our systems in kajabi but yeah i mean even once you're working with clients this could be so powerful just to kind of catch up especially if you're on different time zones and things but in the outreach phase um so so good for them to really get a feel for you um and i mean i've i can imagine that you would do this like if i would say research in clever programmer talk about clever program again you could be on the clever program or website you could have that with the screen shared you could show what you were finding um talk over it and yeah did a video so powerful so i would just get comfortable with that um and with something like loom i mean you can even start by practicing if if video is something that is really um terrifying to you um you could just take baby steps um yeah you've got things like instagram stories you can use loom and you can just make videos for yourself and just steadily get used to seeing yourself on the camera um and then by the time that you're in a position where you're working with clients and you've got video calls it's just like in nature yep exactly i mean i try to start loom but i think my camera is being used up by another device so it's only like a yellow little mark here actually let me yeah let me end it right now but you you guys won't get a yellow mark like this which will happen is loom will record your screen so here i just record it for just a few seconds and you'll see it already created a link and the video is online so if you guys actually went to this link right here you'd be able to see this exact video i can even drop it in the chat i mean it's not a very awesome video but you get the point the fact that i was able to make a video in like a second and then boom it's up so what rachel is saying is she would now actually make a video talking about what the client is looking for and then send that directly through upwork and that will crush if i had seen a video from you i would be like it's game over like i would just yeah i would probably skip the interview that's it it just gives you that so much extra connection doesn't it there's so much you can get from a video yep as an extra tool exactly so let's let me go full screen this huge tool all right so keep going rachel and if you want me to move on to the next one i can do that too yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to the next one all right let's do it and ahmad says seriously the years of experience doesn't matter if you have the skills and that's it most people are afraid to apply for jobs when they see that years of experience mmhmm yeah all right so true isn't it go for it rachel so true oh so this this is jen from um from our community the prophet javascript so i shared this because the other point i really want to talk about is the power of community um especially like when i was talking about that outreach stage earlier you know like for me when i was transitioning out of my job and into um freelance it's such a massive mindset shift um to go from that ninetofive world to and to kind of like normalize the online world yeah when your friends and family are like you do you do what um yeah exactly they're like oh what are you doing and you're like i'm doing something on upwork yeah get away from me what's your job oh my god what the hell amberly just gave a five dollar super chat no and she said go rachel so proud of you crushing it and she goes i guess quasi is all right too oh i'm believing wow thank you so much amberly thank you i wish i could make you my girlfriend this is such a sweet person amberly oh man um so yeah this is jen so um yeah a huge a huge thing that's helpful in that kind of in that stage especially and with your mindset is just the people that you're surrounded by because they're gonna dictate what you think is possible um if you've got the right community around you you've got accountability you've got support um you've got people to ask questions you've got people to celebrate with you which is why you shared this post from jen especially um jen had this amazing win last week didn't you kazi um yeah and just look at those reactions from us so last week uh jen from our program profit with javascript actually got a job i don't know if you know this but she actually got a job offer uh so she got fired so here's the crazy thing about jen that happened she got fired uh because of covid a week ago and um those guys are dumb asses to fire her she's like one of the most amazing people you know i'm like i wish we could hire her so that happened and that was like sad but a week later she gets a job offer for twice as much so she was initially getting paid 46 000 something now she got a job offer for 95 000 a year with a six percent bonus year over year and uh there was yeah it was mindblowing so that's the offer she got and um one the employer here's what the thing that he was impressed with so just think about how crazy that is last week she got she lost her job because of covid and then this week the employer was super impressed by her covet tracker app that she had built within profit with javascript and that's actually what made them decide to give her the 96k year offer man that's amazing isn't it yeah i was like what pretty crazy and even she says that she goes right at the end of the call i got a job offer at almost twice what i used to make they mentioned one thing that really impressed them was the covet tracker we are learning real world projects that land jobs and i think this actually has the most reactions i've ever seen yeah right so much going on there yeah seriously that's it and you you see that in the community all the time it's the power of being around people like that is um like i saw somebody posting there recently that they were struggling and so many so many other other members jumped in to give advice to give support and to lift them back up and that just makes such a difference between carrying on on what's a really hard journey and quitting and winning yep and uh there's somebody who said on the stream this turns out to be one of the best developer freelance guide videos i have ever seen on youtube rachel is giving out real gems no damn yeah rachel doesn't just everybody knows rachel doesn't do well with compliments she's just like such a boss that like when you give her compliments she doesn't even hear you but like i want i'm so happy that all these comments are coming in like my number one goal here is just bombard her with compliments so keep them coming you guys thank you guys yeah ziad says this makes me more excited to learn that's amazing yes yeah this is this is really cool uh okay cool so should we move on to the next one yeah yeah i think so for sure so yeah that just wrapped up with the community and the people that you surround yourself with yeah and here we are with google the ability to google is this important rachel it's so important go ahead rachel i'll let you speak to this one oh google it's just such a key skill isn't it it's it kind of speaks to what we said earlier as well about so much of um what makes you appealing to a client or an employer is your character um and then you kind of understand it and you can al always need to be able to find the right things with google um your resourcefulness yes yeah the resourcefulness is crazy and even with programming pretty much everything comes out to google link like a lot of it comes out to google and i saw this funny image today um let me see if i can actually find a way to um bring that up somehow let's see give me one second here i found like i found a really funny image on how googling works and how people like how people become developers okay i found it now what i have to do is actually send it over on slack so i'm going to send it over on slack real quick rachel and here we go okay guys just just stick with me here for just a few seconds and i think i got it all right i'm gonna bring it onto the screen come on slack come on slack all right please slack just okay all right boom sorry guys just one second this is funny so i have to show it to you all right there we go uh so catalin pitt i saw his uh tweet i think from him and he says let me break it down for you coding is one percent actually coding oh let me move my girlfriend's comment from the screen 40 debugging 15 coffee breaks which rachel knows all about the coffee breaks 30 googling errors nine percent staring with your colleagues at the screen 100 true and then five percent trying to copy and paste solutions from stack overflow this right here guys is your guide to coding and crushing it in coding like seriously it's crazy but that's really what it is like rachel probably when you think of me as a developer you probably think i sit in front of a computer and then just like i just put on my hacker sunglasses and i just code all day never that has never happened it's so boring to look at me i'm like reading documentation i look like a lazy piece of i'm just like scrolling like drinking my perry sitting there like a lot of the day looks like i'm doing nothing and then something happens at the end and i'm like oh my god this is crazy some copy pasting worked so google power exactly so yeah hopefully that was worth the pain of showing it all right here we go yeah people are loving it they're like 15 coffee breaks sound good so much of my day is like let's go get a coffee i swear to god i almost break up my day in that so what about the coffee it's all about the coffee all right so let's move on to the next thing so we got the coffee covered and we got some of the google skills covered now what are some other important skills what are some important things that you need to have on your portfolio rachel well now we're into projects like as we just saw with jen and the power of that covet 19 yes tracker projects especially what you guys have been doing on the live streams recently been going crazy we've been going crazy absolutely crazy i think um so even if we go to youtube i can actually like pull it up for everybody here like what we've been building but if you guys have been following over the last few days like have you been have you no do you know rachel what we have been building over the last few days yeah i've been i've been seeing all the different epic projects i mean you've done tik tok tinder youtube clone yep all kinds of craziness yeah so let me actually it's insane so guys take a look at this so hopefully everybody can see the screen but like literally yesterday holy crap the views are crazy on this one but yesterday we built the tick tock clone i don't know why my freaking annotation just decided to stop working and freeze um okay let me close out of a few things please work but i mean you can see it right rachel the tick tock clone yep yeah i mean we've even got the cover 19 tracker there the covet 19 tracker yup the youtube we actually started a show called dev's got talent i don't know if you know about that we're giving out prizes people are getting angry so so much fun um and here we got the tinder clone that we built which you guys can watch and learn from and just build these guys in the literally the last week if you if i keep going down we built a netflix clone we bit built amazon clone we built instagram clone uh we built tinder and tick tock clone and we're now going to be building these spotify clones soon just having some of these can get you a job on your portfolio imagine if you have all of these then i'm worried you might just be overqualified and you can't get a job anyway what do you think rachel right then i think you start getting the problem the other way because you'd imagine having all of those tangible projects yes that's crazy so for the world of developers like i think it will really help you to have projects and then have them on your portfolio and look rachel matt apparently made this slide apparently yeah so you guys you can put this on your portfolio and use that also to kind of get jobs and anything else rachel that's on your mind about freelancing and all of that just on the on the portfolio note um and obviously having that portfolio to make it easy and then having that really easily accessible on all your social media and all your platforms um like we talked about earlier yep make sure that's there and people can just hop in and see it so they can see your social they can see you put they can see your portfolio maybe you've sent them a video and then bam you've made such an amazing impression yeah because yeah because once they see your okay they see your video and they're like okay i'm pumped i want to know more about this person and then they see your portfolio and then they're like hey you've built like a bunch of projects and you can code too so you're not just bs'ing it's like real world stuff and you go okay cool that's the cool thing about coding and it's just like real you can actually hold it in your hands i mean virtually so let me actually just go ahead and do this awesome um i think this was phenomenal i think hopefully this provided a lot of value to everybody who's watched it how are you feeling rachel so far okay i'm feeling good i'm feeling good i hope it was helpful guys yeah guys if you thought that that was helpful or valuable to you just drop it in the comments below let us know if you've enjoyed what rachel put this together because guys rachel took a lot of time out of her day to put this together for you guys and she's here today and like working on it and she told you know her husband her kids to just leave her alone so she could do this for a little while so guys smash that like button for her and let's get this video going out to as many people as possible because if it provided you with value it's gonna provide other people with value as well so this was so huge rachel thanks so much for this you know this entire presentation i think this was tremendously helpful for people oh thank you and thank you everybody for being here we really appreciate it yeah awesome and yeah i mean if you guys want to see more of rachel's trainings let us know that as well i think rachel would um you know i don't know rachel what are you feeling like you she might want to come down next week or even the week after that to run a training uh i think that that was really exciting how are you feeling about that rachel okay i could make that happen yeah so crazy that full circle we started like we started you started being on the team from upwork now you're talking about upwork i think that's really freaking cool and i think that's real value for people because it's something real not just like you're talking about a platform that you didn't actually get paid from you know or you're talking about a platform that you have no idea about you know and so i think that's valuable i think the tips in this are really valuable for you guys if you actually start taking action on these because a lot of you will be like oh it's a cool idea to send videos oh it's a cool idea to personalize your message but then i'm going to look at your messages and it's going to be just copy pasted templates because that's the easy way out and there's going to be no video because that's also an easy way out and so if you want to take value from rachel by being here and instead of her spending three years to figure it out and then you spend three years to figure it out if you truly want to take value start actually taking action on what you learned here today so as of today make it a mission to go ahead and do something so here's what i want to do right now guys in the comments let drop below what action you're gonna take and commit to it and time bound it so i'll give you an example of a bad goal that you can set for this week a bad goal will be i definitely will learn more about freelancing that's an awful goal but if you set a goal and here's what a good goal will sound like and rachel you could help me with this too but what a good goal might sound like is i am going to do three i'm going to make a profile on upwork by today or by tomorrow i'm going to reach out to three people on upwork and i'm gonna do all of that by tomorrow so now it has a time it's time bound and it's very specific what you're gonna do what would you say rachel could could we make that better is that pretty good i think that's great i mean it's specific it's actionable it's what you can control you can you can do that outreach make the profile you've put a timestamp on it to give yourself a container so so much better yep so go ahead and start dropping below guys what are you going to be doing uh from this live stream today because i i like the views we like the likes you guys give this but what i really care about and what we care about the most is how many of you actually take action on it and do something that actually changes your life i think it's cool that you watch this video and it's super we're thankful for you but that's what truly matters right yeah i would love to see you get results i mean i can't believe that like from that upwork message two and a half years ago here we are so that's the power of taking action isn't it it's it's a massive massive power so definitely in the comments below you know drop you're gonna reach out to x amount of people make up upwork profile today and commit to that so drop that in the comments whether you want to do it on upwork or freelancer.com or fiverr.com the platform doesn't really matter that much the principles that rachel talked about will work for you on any of the platforms where you can do the outreach she gave you multiple resources like craigslist as well so there's no reason that today you shouldn't have a profile on upwork and now a lot of you're going to cry i got rejected by upworker then i stopped that's okay move on to craigslist make a job posting on craigslist nobody will reject you from craigslist do few things commit to them in the chat below and i want to start like reading out what you guys are going to be doing a little jackie actually says i have already earned 25 000 using upwork that's awesome that's great amazing love hearing that let's see what's going on um evil namakian says i've already made hundreds of dollars um using flask that's great great job guys okay i'm gonna go ahead and start reading your guys's goals out now amanda says i'm going to create a upwork account today even though i was rejected once that's great pumped about that yeah way to go there's some there's somebody whose name is some guy and he says i'm on craigslist as we speak so i want you to make a job posting today on craigslist and do that probably right now actually the biggest hack i can give you for a job posting on craigslist is the first picture make it your picture and be smiling in it because you know craigslist allow you to post like 10 photos so use that and put your photo in there that's smart yeah will brush up my javascript this week all good that's okay i heard it rachel you can go that's fine i only see two good goals in the chat unless i'm missing them somehow but i only see like two good timebound goals deadline goals guys it's great they're getting value but again we're not gonna rest until we see you guys taking
