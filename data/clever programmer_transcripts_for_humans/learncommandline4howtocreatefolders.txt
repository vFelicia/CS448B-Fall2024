00:00 - hey guys all right so as promised in
00:02 - this video i want to show you how you
00:04 - can actually create a new folder and the
00:07 - reason why I want to keep these videos
00:09 - like short little nuggets is because I
00:11 - want you to try these things out as you
00:13 - go please do not just sit and watch this
00:15 - and learn this whether you're doing it
00:17 - for school or whether you're doing it
00:19 - for your personal enjoyment or for your
00:22 - job whatever it is actively be a part of
00:26 - this because it'll all seem so easy so
00:29 - obvious you'll be like died all makes
00:31 - sense but then you'll sit there and your
00:33 - face will be blank and your mind will
00:35 - just be going numb so I don't want that
00:37 - to happen to you please follow along all
00:40 - right pause this video right now follow
00:42 - along or have my video on one screen or
00:46 - like half of the screen on the other
00:47 - half actually have your command line
00:49 - open and follow this so in this video I
00:53 - promise you I'm going to show you a
00:54 - creole folder so let's do that so I have
00:57 - this playground folder okay what if I
01:00 - deleted it so I'm just going to go ahead
01:01 - and delete it it's gone and i'm going to
01:04 - simply create a folder so let me hit CD
01:08 - because CD takes me back home or you can
01:10 - do CD squiggly and i will hit LS and i
01:16 - will go to CD documents and then I'll
01:19 - see PWD and I am right here right that's
01:22 - what's around me if I hit a less you see
01:25 - all those things around me ok I want to
01:27 - create a new folder let's call this
01:29 - folder playground how do I do it mkay
01:33 - dir essentially it stands for make
01:37 - directory ok so MK der make directory
01:41 - and I think that should work in git bash
01:44 - if you're on Windows and MK dirt
01:47 - followed by the folder that you want so
01:50 - what do you want to name it so we're
01:52 - going to name it playground so I'm going
01:53 - to hit enter and i will hit and you can
01:57 - see it's right there how cool is that ok
02:01 - i'm going to give you a little sneak
02:02 - peek of a bit again i'm going to delete
02:06 - it and i'm going to do MK der or i can
02:09 - just hit up on my keyboard remember you
02:11 - can recall you
02:13 - or last commands by just hitting up and
02:15 - so I'm going to hit up and pay attention
02:19 - to that side at the top pay attention to
02:22 - that ok you're going to see playground
02:23 - pop-up right there all right three two
02:27 - one boom took a little bit longer than
02:32 - three two one but you get the points
02:34 - right there so look at that I didn't
02:36 - even actually have to do anything it was
02:38 - like magic I just got to do it right
02:40 - from the keyboard right from the command
02:43 - line ok so these are just some shortcuts
02:46 - you'll see that it'll keep on adding
02:49 - more and more value to your programming
02:52 - skills as you learn more of the command
02:54 - line ok so that's it for this video
02:58 - practice this right now and i'll see you
03:01 - in the next video
