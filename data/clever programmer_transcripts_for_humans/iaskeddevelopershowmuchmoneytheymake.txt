00:59 - actually in college I should say that
01:01 - that's a major key you get at least like
01:03 - a three-month internship that'll negate
01:05 - any sort of experience because then like
01:08 - you've gone through the process at that
01:10 - point you know you've gone through the
01:11 - software development life cycle once
01:12 - you've done that most jobs are like all
01:14 - right you're good to go my name is
01:15 - Camille I'm 24. I'm a front-end software
01:19 - engineer I work at Peloton in New York
01:21 - City my first job was with Peloton yeah
01:23 - wow amazing and how did you go about
01:26 - getting your first job I applied to
01:28 - probably 200 companies
01:31 - thank you
01:33 - and maybe like 10 people will be like
01:36 - hey never forget that people want to
01:39 - refer you because they get referral
01:41 - bonuses you don't want to know how much
01:42 - did you make on your first developer job
01:44 - uh so my first job my salary was 110. I
01:49 - had a 15K signing bonus and My Equity
01:52 - was about Equity as well um wow that's
01:56 - awesome well Peloton stock it used to be
01:59 - worth a lot more we've had an amazing
02:01 - time meeting people one piece of advice
02:04 - if you thought 125 000 is a lot then
02:08 - you'll be surprised to see what some of
02:10 - these developers are getting paid at the
02:11 - biggest companies the thing is
02:13 - developers are often shy about their
02:16 - salaries how much money do you make as a
02:18 - software engineer uh I will not reveal
02:20 - that I'm not comfortable sharing that I
02:22 - don't want to answer that no I can't do
02:24 - that sorry no worries will we find
02:26 - people willing to share yo that is
02:29 - awesome nice to meet you Mark what's it
02:31 - like working at Netflix ooh I mean it's
02:34 - great it's fun it's a big company but
02:37 - you get a lot of freedom I've talked to
02:39 - people and they're like hey even over
02:40 - sometimes a senior developer they'd
02:42 - prefer somebody who's Maybe Junior and
02:45 - but is like really hungry but they don't
02:47 - have the craziest amount of experience
02:48 - is it possible they could work at a
02:51 - company like Netflix I mean anything is
02:53 - possible I think it depends like keep
02:55 - focusing on your skills skills are
02:57 - really truly what matters trying to show
02:58 - your skills through other means because
03:00 - clearly you don't have like experience
03:02 - so understanding what you use so we
03:04 - often use like Frameworks and libraries
03:06 - actually reading a lot of code digging
03:08 - into those libraries I think is super
03:09 - important so if you're comfortable
03:11 - sharing how much do you make as a
03:13 - software developer I don't think I'm
03:14 - comfortable sharing got it well thank
03:17 - you so much Mark I appreciate it now
03:19 - that was unfortunate but these next
03:21 - developers are earning multiple six
03:23 - figures I'm here with Dalvin so my
03:25 - advice for somebody who wants to get
03:27 - into tech for the first time would be
03:28 - start trying to learn on YouTube you
03:31 - don't have to go to a boot camp or pay
03:32 - money if you don't want to start
03:34 - creating projects that you're interested
03:36 - in doing stuff that you like if I'm into
03:37 - sneakers I'm gonna try to make the Nike
03:39 - app again and put it on my portfolio and
03:42 - resume are you willing to say how much
03:43 - you make right now yeah so currently I
03:46 - make
03:47 - 146. damn that is amazing it's basically
03:51 - fake it till you make it yeah that's
03:53 - like my best advice so I'm here with
03:55 - Trent I guess tell us about yourself
03:57 - like what do you do sure I'm a full
03:59 - stack engineer at Glassdoor I've been
04:02 - doing this for about seven years now and
04:05 - I actually in college I was a pre-med
04:07 - major and switched to this last minute
04:08 - wow and it turned out to be a pretty
04:10 - good decision I never would have thought
04:12 - I would be here at a Tech conference and
04:14 - here I am if you want to share like how
04:15 - much you made at your first CS job sure
04:18 - I made uh it was 70 grand 70 grand in
04:21 - Chicago in Chicago and then how about
04:23 - now dude we don't give a range of like
04:25 - how much energy I think I make 180 Grand
04:28 - now after six seven years elevations
04:30 - yeah that's amazing yeah which is
04:32 - nothing for you know California electric
04:34 - car the cost of living the cost of
04:36 - living in California I'm here with Alex
04:37 - guys so I'm a DJ right I needed to make
04:41 - an app to help me organize my music I
04:43 - didn't know how to cook anything but the
04:45 - thing that I learned through that
04:46 - process was that I didn't hate it
04:47 - because one thing that I see a lot of
04:50 - newcomers come in like they see the
04:51 - price tag and then they get a month into
04:53 - the job and they realize I don't really
04:54 - like coding so much join the community
04:56 - try building something figure out that
04:58 - process for yourself and if you like it
04:59 - then you should be good to go how much
05:00 - money do you make as a software
05:01 - developer 2013 I started 40 Grand after
05:04 - a year there and they bumped me 75. by
05:06 - the end of 2018 it was lead devs for 130
05:08 - and then I'm in that like range like 200
05:11 - initial that is amazing man I would say
05:13 - so I've hired a lot of Junior devs if
05:15 - you're like totally fresh you're
05:16 - probably looking in the 60 70 range
05:18 - which I think is still really good these
05:19 - days if you thought 200 000 was a lot
05:22 - these next two developers are paid crazy
05:25 - all right so I'm here with Anthony tell
05:27 - us about yourself went to college for
05:29 - computer science ended up dropping out
05:31 - and just going self-learning Route
05:33 - anyone can get into this career path
05:35 - it's not like for intelligent people
05:37 - I've seen people who have worked their
05:40 - whole lives in like the surface industry
05:42 - go into like a boot camp or go into like
05:46 - a self-learning path and come out making
05:48 - two to three times the amount of money
05:50 - that they were and being two to three
05:53 - times happier in their role it's for
05:55 - everyone but I I ended up getting a job
05:57 - as a junior web developer and then from
05:59 - there just improving my skills and I
06:02 - made 17 an hour it was like 30 000 a
06:06 - year amazing and if you don't mind
06:07 - sharing like a range of how much do you
06:09 - make now yeah I make around 250 000 a
06:12 - year yeah this next developer is among
06:16 - the highest paid developers on Earth and
06:19 - this is how we got here what's up guys
06:21 - I'm here with Matthew tell us a little
06:23 - bit about yourself I am a developer at
06:25 - Credit Karma I have been for the past
06:28 - four-ish years since like 2018. right we
06:30 - have a lot of developers when they look
06:31 - at the job posting it says like hey we
06:33 - need like one year to five years of
06:35 - experience all right so like how would
06:36 - you be your advice for that even if it
06:38 - doesn't um if I don't have the years of
06:40 - experience if I don't meet every single
06:41 - qualification I would say go for it um
06:44 - like the worst that can happen is they
06:45 - say no awesome okay and when you got
06:47 - your first job as a developer how much
06:49 - did you make right out of college I was
06:50 - working at a company called axture and I
06:53 - was offered 80k a year here I switched
06:56 - because I realized that I wasn't growing
06:58 - the way I needed to I wasn't learning
06:59 - new technologies yeah I also do believe
07:01 - that the quickest way to like get raises
07:03 - and salaries to keep looking keep
