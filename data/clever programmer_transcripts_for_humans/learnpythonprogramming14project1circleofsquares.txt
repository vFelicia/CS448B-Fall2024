00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazzy so in
00:02 - this video I want to talk about a
00:04 - project all right so we learned a little
00:07 - bit about loops and how we can do some
00:10 - cool loops and make squares we learned
00:12 - about functions and how you can give
00:14 - multiple arguments to functions we did
00:17 - all of this while visualizing the code
00:19 - that's why we use the turtle python
00:21 - module so you can learn visually no
00:24 - matter how old you are no matter how
00:25 - young you are visual learning is one of
00:28 - the best ways to learn and to visualize
00:30 - your code it's amazing cuz you get it
00:33 - right away now I want
00:37 - to take this time and now allow you guys
00:40 - to do an actual project so up to this
00:43 - point we did a lot of fun stuff and I
00:45 - gave you some basic exercises like make
00:47 - a square now I want to give you a little
00:49 - bit of a project it might take you long
00:51 - it might not take you that long it's not
00:54 - that much code at all it's uh you just
00:56 - have to put a lot of these ideas
00:58 - together here's the project I want you
01:00 - to make a circle out of squares what do
01:04 - I mean just to be clear about what you
01:06 - need to do in the project and how it
01:07 - should look like I've designed this demo
01:09 - for you guys so check it
01:15 - out make a square turn a little bit make
01:18 - a square turn a little bit make a square
01:20 - turn a little bit make a square turn a
01:22 - little bit okay you get the idea you
01:24 - keep going like this and eventually you
01:27 - get a circle and if you notice and if
01:29 - you look really really into it you can
01:31 - probably keep looking at this forever
01:33 - it's fascinating so I love this thing I
01:38 - can myself look at it
01:41 - forever um
01:47 - yeah pretty enjoyable okay so I'm going
01:51 - to stop it right here you guys now have
01:53 - fun with it try to make something like
01:54 - this okay it's not too complicated it's
01:56 - really simple make a square turn make a
01:58 - square turn it just helps you put all
02:01 - the programming Concepts we've learned
02:03 - so far variables using the turtle module
02:07 - the looping
02:08 - structures and arguments in functions
02:11 - and the range thing that we looked at in
02:14 - a loop so good luck and I think you can
02:16 - do it all right I will see you in the
02:19 - next video where I'll provide you with
02:20 - the solution
