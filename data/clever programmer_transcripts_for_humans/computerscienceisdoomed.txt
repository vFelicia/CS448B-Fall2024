00:00 - the field of computer science is doomed
00:03 - that's a banger if you think about
00:05 - computer science what is the field about
00:07 - what does it mean what's the core idea
00:09 - of it it's the idea of taking an idea an
00:11 - algorithm or a concept or a data
00:13 - structure and translating it into a
00:16 - program that's what computer science has
00:18 - always been about before it was playing
00:20 - with logic gates directly then we went
00:22 - to a higher level language which was
00:24 - like assembly and then we got higher
00:26 - level languages like Java and then we
00:29 - started getting languages like
00:30 - JavaScript Python and so if you look we
00:34 - kept going higher and higher level than
00:36 - bits and bytes logic gates assembly
00:40 - JavaScript Ai and the idea of AI is
00:42 - turning natural language ideas into
00:44 - programs
