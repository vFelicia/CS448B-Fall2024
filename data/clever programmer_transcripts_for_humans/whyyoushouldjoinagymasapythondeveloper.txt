00:00 - yeah get the to the gym bro what's
00:03 - up this is Kazi from clever programmer
00:06 - calm in this video I want to talk about
00:09 - why everyone and specially every Python
00:12 - developer needs to get the fall to the
00:16 - gym alright what I want to talk to you
00:18 - about in this video is I get questions
00:20 - like how do I deal with anxiety Kazi how
00:23 - do I deal with procrastination you know
00:25 - they don't say that they say
00:26 - procrastination and how do I deal with
00:29 - being not productive sometimes I'm
00:32 - working and my brain is blank I get
00:34 - frustrated when I'm coding the simple
00:37 - answer okay and probably which not most
00:40 - of you're gonna like because
00:41 - most of you are probably like how I used
00:44 - to be and I hated gym and I loved being
00:46 - behind my computer and doing stuff
00:48 - that's funny
00:49 - Aaron just raised his hand but he's
00:52 - actually more jacked than I am so let's
00:54 - continue with this fish yeah because
00:56 - okay please understand that a lot of
00:59 - these things that happen with developers
01:01 - actually come from having a weak mindset
01:04 - and this isn't just applicable to their
01:08 - coding and how they get frustrated and
01:10 - not making much progress in coding this
01:12 - actually has to do with how when they're
01:15 - applying to jobs after a few declines or
01:18 - people refusing you or not responding to
01:20 - you this is actually what's gonna break
01:22 - you down a lot of the times too because
01:24 - you're not mentally strong most
01:26 - developers aren't they're really weak
01:28 - fragile people okay that is what's often
01:32 - time gonna stop you from making the
01:35 - progress and going to where you need to
01:37 - go I mean look at how Jack simple
01:39 - programmer is and then think about how
01:41 - successful he is write direct
01:43 - correlation I'm getting there
01:45 - simple program first John sunrise I'm
01:47 - coming for you bro what I want to share
01:51 - with people is the reason why some
01:53 - people are just way more resilient first
01:56 - of all read a book called anti fragile
01:58 - we're gonna pop it up in here read a
02:01 - book called anti fragile
02:02 - this book talks about this concept
02:05 - called being anti fragile and what does
02:08 - anti fragile mean let's say we have a
02:10 - box and in that box we put a glass now
02:14 - if we move this box that glass might
02:16 - actually break now let's say we put
02:19 - something else like a stone now if we
02:22 - move it a lot it might not break it's
02:24 - kind of weird right but but it will but
02:28 - if you use enough force you can even
02:30 - freaking crack stone right you can even
02:32 - break that but now with anti fragile and
02:35 - matching a material like glass and you
02:37 - put it in a box and then as you start
02:39 - shaking it it sounds like it's about to
02:41 - break but then it gets then you hit the
02:45 - more you move it it doesn't break so
02:47 - you're like what's going on and then you
02:49 - shake it more and then it gets harder
02:50 - and it doesn't break and then it gets
02:52 - even more difficult to break and
02:54 - eventually it turns into just being
02:56 - impossible and then what you realize is
02:58 - the more you shake it the stronger it
03:00 - gets the more you around with this
03:04 - the tougher it gets all right that's how
03:07 - you want to be so you want to be just
03:09 - type of person who when somebody is like
03:11 -  around with you you're like you
03:13 - kind of with them back then the
03:15 - more the would you with them
03:16 - more back and then when they get in your
03:18 - phase lock you I'm gonna solve this and
03:20 - on a fix this and I have the answer so
03:23 - what I want you to focus on from all of
03:25 - what I just said is you want to become
03:27 - anti fragile so sometimes what that
03:29 - looks like is artificially doing things
03:32 - that make your life more difficult so
03:34 - some people have really pampered lives
03:36 - or even if they don't if they're being
03:38 - if they're developers they're just
03:40 - sitting behind their computer in a very
03:42 - sedentary way using a chair like this
03:45 - which is very comfortable we're sitting
03:47 - usually for 8 to 10 hours 15 hours at a
03:50 - time sometimes for me I'm sitting there
03:52 - like for 18 hours encoding or doing
03:55 - something on my computer or doing
03:56 - something with my youtube channel or
03:58 - coding whatever it may be so just
03:59 - realize that we're spending so much time
04:02 - doing things that are not challenging
04:05 - that require you to just kind of
04:07 - freaking chill okay
04:09 - what does this lead to this leads to a
04:12 - brain and a body that's really weak any
04:16 - adversity it phases faces it it stops
04:19 - and it fails we're driven completely by
04:22 - our emotions but we're we do a lot of
04:26 - things on a day to day basis by our
04:27 - emotions what we want to eat is based on
04:30 - our emotions we're thinking about how
04:31 - will make us feel who we want to meet
04:33 - with is based on our emotions because we
04:36 - know how that person will make us feel
04:37 - so when it comes to being a developer
04:40 - dad is also really driven by emotion so
04:42 - if you're not feeling well you're
04:44 - probably not gonna perform that well and
04:45 - if you're feeling down because you got
04:47 - to reject it from a particular job
04:49 - you're also not gonna keep applying so
04:52 - what you need to do and what has helped
04:54 - me a lot is constantly going to the gym
04:58 - now I've been training and boxing I have
05:01 - been doing kickboxing a little bit but
05:04 - I've been mostly doing jujitsu as well
05:06 - so lots of fighting skills and then also
05:09 - strength training like powerlifting has
05:12 - helped me a lot mentally okay so yes it
05:15 - has physically helped me but it has made
05:16 - me a lot more internally confident which
05:19 - then show and made me a lot more
05:20 - resilient and my grid is stronger so
05:23 - then when I'm coding or I'm doing
05:24 - something like making this video this
05:26 - video up I just go again I it's
05:28 - easy and same thing when I'm coding and
05:31 - I mess up I can just keep going non-stop
05:33 - and if I start picking up the phone and
05:35 - I'm calling clients I just keep going
05:37 - unlike a lot of you who just
05:40 - give up a lot of you what I want to just
05:41 - say is you are strong in your own ways
05:44 - but sometimes what happens with a lot of
05:46 - developers is that they go okay I cause
05:51 - II but I didn't get a job I didn't get
05:54 - the freelancing opportunity this coding
05:56 - stuff doesn't work for me and then when
05:58 - I actually get on the phone with them or
06:00 - actually speak with them DM them
06:02 - one-on-one what I usually find out is
06:05 - they either applied to two or three or
06:07 - four places max and then they might have
06:10 - stopped even if they applied to 20
06:12 - places and they stopped
06:13 - that's failure in my book okay you
06:16 - should not stop or maybe they got failed
06:18 - or kicked out from one inner
06:20 - right maybe they tried one or two
06:21 - interviews didn't work they just gave up
06:24 - that resilience is the difference
06:26 - between you landing a job for 40 60 80
06:29 - hundred thousand dollars a year if not
06:31 - more versus you staying exactly where
06:33 - you are is the difference between you
06:35 - becoming a remote developer and
06:37 - traveling wherever the you want
06:38 - versus staying exactly where you're at
06:41 - this is the difference between you being
06:43 - able to provide for your family and your
06:45 - girlfriend versus being a loser
06:47 - okay so it's a very simple decision that
06:50 - you can make you can either get stronger
06:52 - and become more anti fragile or you can
06:54 - stay weak and have a weak mind which
06:57 - will lead to weak results in a weak life
07:00 - and weakness is actually a very
07:02 - unattractive characteristic the point of
07:05 - this video is probably this week you
07:08 - should get a membership to a freaking
07:10 - gym around you okay start with a simple
07:12 - step or you can start with something
07:14 - that's too much commitment for you you
07:15 - can literally right after watching this
07:17 - video just go for a walk okay something
07:20 - simple or you can do this you can do
07:21 - five push-ups something that gets you
07:24 - more in your body I promise you it this
07:26 - is the thing the thing that will help
07:29 - you code better they'll help you think
07:31 - more effectively let me put it like this
07:34 - sometimes I spent eight hours coding and
07:36 - I don't exercise I eat poorly and my
07:39 - effectiveness in coding is I can't
07:42 - even make like a nap my brain is
07:44 - blanking out a lot my effectiveness and
07:45 - my efficiency is so poor sometimes all
07:48 - lift for two hours then I'll spend some
07:51 - time eating then I'll hang out with
07:52 - somebody I really love I'll come back
07:54 - and code for two hours and I'll actually
07:56 - complete that app so I will basically
07:59 -  on eight hours of results sorry
08:04 - eight hours of work with only two hours
08:06 - of really effective work and that those
08:09 - are the types of things that being able
08:11 - to work out actually allow me to do and
08:13 - it personally makes me more effective so
08:16 - what I would suggest for you is give
08:18 - that a try alright what I want you to do
08:20 - now at this point of the video is drop
08:22 - in the comments below what is the one
08:24 - thing you will commit to doing right
08:26 - after watching this video I want you to
08:28 - take an action step right
08:30 - for watching this video because
08:31 - otherwise this video is completely
08:33 - useless and you have just wasted two
08:36 - last nine or ten minutes however long
08:38 - this video is by not taking any action
08:41 - right now so if you wash this please it
08:45 - would be amazing and it would be a
08:46 - privilege for me and and I would love it
08:49 - if you just took some amount of action
08:52 - and I really do care if you drop it in
08:54 - the comments below I promise I will
08:55 - actually reply it back all right the
08:57 - real me so what I want you to do is take
08:59 - a commit to taking action step and drop
09:01 - it in the comments below what's one
09:03 - thing you're gonna do right after you
09:04 - stop this video it could be doing two
09:07 - push-ups it could be doing five push-ups
09:09 - it could be like I'm gonna take a walk
09:11 - outside my apartment or my house and
09:13 - just come back in or maybe you will
09:16 - commit to actually getting even a ten
09:18 - dollar membership at your gym or getting
09:20 - a one day ten dollar pass at the Gold's
09:23 - Gym near you whatever it may be what is
09:25 - the one thing you commit to doing right
09:27 - now drop it in the comments below I
09:29 - would love to come and chat with you in
09:32 - the comments that's it for this video
09:34 - thank you so much for watching as always
