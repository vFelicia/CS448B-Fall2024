00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the learn
00:02 - command line tutorial let's learn how to
00:05 - rename things
00:08 - so uh essentially you can see I have
00:10 - that folder called playground but what
00:12 - if I didn't like it being called
00:13 - playground what if I wanted it to be
00:15 - called not playground or clever
00:19 - programmer or something like that right
00:21 - you're just sitting there you get those
00:23 - urges you just want to call things
00:24 - clever programmer for no reason so let's
00:27 - just do that let's call it whatever we
00:28 - want so the command is actually called
00:33 - [Music]
00:36 - MV MV so I'm going to do
00:40 - MV and I'll explain to you more how that
00:43 - command works but for now let's just use
00:46 - it for this so I'm going to say
00:52 - um MV
00:55 - playground oh I got to get out of
00:57 - Playground now I'm in documents remember
01:00 - remember I do the dot dot to get out of
01:01 - it or CD dot dot if I'm on Windows using
01:05 - git bash so I am out of it now if I do
01:08 - LS I should see playground right there
01:11 - so MV takes in two arguments the first
01:13 - argument is the file and then the second
01:17 - argument you give it and the arguments
01:18 - are determined by the
01:20 - spaces is what I want to name it so I
01:25 - want to essentially what I'm saying is
01:27 - change the name of playground to
01:31 - and I want to change it
01:33 - to not
01:36 - playground
01:38 - anymore hit
01:40 - enter and you see that it just changed
01:43 - all of a sudden to not playground
01:45 - anymore
01:47 - okay that's it for this video very
01:50 - simple go ahead and practice renaming
01:52 - files you can rename uh or sorry folders
01:55 - you can rename files the same way all
01:58 - right so go ahead and practice that in
02:00 - the next video we will cover how to move
02:02 - files
