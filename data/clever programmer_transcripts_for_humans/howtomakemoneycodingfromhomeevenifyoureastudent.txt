00:00 - hey guys Jacob here so today we'll be
00:02 - talking about money I want to show you
00:04 - how to make money as a student with code
00:07 - basically for all of my methods you
00:10 - don't need any experience but you should
00:12 - know at least how to code I will cover
00:15 - five bullet points and describe all of
00:17 - them let's go
00:20 - [Music]
00:38 - alright let's so let's get to the first
00:41 - advice so basically it's the most simple
00:44 - advice you can get it's get a job yeah
00:47 - I'm not kidding
00:47 - I literally suggest you do first of all
00:50 - find some internship and then work
00:53 - part-time as a student during your
00:54 - summer holidays you have probably two or
00:57 - three months free so you should use this
01:00 - time wisely and get the internship in
01:02 - some software company I did that once I
01:05 - went to Austria for a Python internship
01:07 - for three months and then when I came
01:09 - back to my hometown I would be able to
01:12 - get two or three different job offers
01:15 - and I could easily choose one of them
01:18 - which is super cool and I suggest you do
01:20 - that and now a lot of you may say Jacob
01:23 - but I have no and I don't have any
01:24 - experience a lot of companies they just
01:27 - declined my offer
01:28 - yeah I've been there what I did is I
01:30 - applied to 50 different companies in
01:32 - Germany I went for tons of different
01:35 - interviews processes all them declined
01:37 - me I was super sad but what I did I
01:39 - didn't give up that after Germany I
01:41 - searched for Austria all the companies
01:44 - and Austria's applied to also like 50 to
01:46 - 70 different companies and for different
01:48 - interviews I felt most of them but the
01:51 - one company they accepted me and I used
01:54 - that opportunity I went there and I
01:56 - learned a lot and it also great for your
01:59 - CV so do that I was also talking about
02:02 - it once in my Instagram you can see the
02:04 - video probably somewhere here when I was
02:06 - talking about it guys so many of you
02:09 - asked me how did I start as a Python
02:11 - developer how did I get my first job so
02:13 - most of the companies they ignored me
02:16 - they didn't even replied for my mails
02:19 - but it's okay I guess because I didn't
02:21 - have much experience migrants but few of
02:24 - them did and they took me to the next
02:27 - stage to the coat interview process but
02:30 - I felt all of them except one so I got
02:34 - this a chance to go to Austria as a
02:36 - Python developer I was pretty excited
02:38 - and that's what you should do guys you
02:41 - should send your CV to as much companies
02:44 - as you can and try to go through the
02:47 - process and maybe you'll get this
02:49 - one single chance all right the next and
02:53 - the second step is freelance I mean this
02:56 - is obvious it's related to get a job but
02:59 - it's actually different for this you may
03:01 - not need any experience at all because
03:04 - you can start from scratch what I do as
03:07 - a freelancer because I also have some
03:09 - experience at freelancer I was asking my
03:11 - friends if they need some help then I
03:13 - was looking at the different groups on a
03:15 - Facebook there are tons of them and I
03:17 - was asking people if they need help if
03:19 - they need some service you can do it as
03:21 - a front-end developer or you can also do
03:23 - it as a back-end developer what's funny
03:25 - about my friend on Instagram he actually
03:27 - got a client and the client pays him 50
03:31 - years per hour for coding he's got his
03:33 - client through Instagram and now for
03:35 - freelance
03:35 - I have also a good advice for you so
03:37 - basically if you have back-end developer
03:39 - as me and you don't know how to design
03:41 - your tera bullet you had colleague
03:43 - front-end you can team up with someone I
03:46 - did that with my friend from uni and we
03:48 - actually deliver a bit hope product in
03:50 - two months and we got paid for that he
03:52 - was doing the front end he was designing
03:54 - and I was developing back-end and we
03:56 - just combine our forces together and I
03:58 - earn the money with this and provide the
03:59 - great product for our client ok and
04:02 - let's talk about today's video sponsor
04:04 - skill sure
04:08 - skipper is an online learning community
04:10 - that offers membership with meaning with
04:13 - so much to explore real projects to
04:15 - create and the support of fellow
04:17 - creatives sculture empowers you to
04:19 - accomplish real growth skill sure is
04:22 - also a great platform to go if you're
04:24 - looking to improve your skills they
04:26 - offer great classes so you can improve
04:29 - your web development skills you can
04:30 - learn javascript CSS HTML and then it
04:33 - will help you to get your first clients
04:35 - and earn money with code skills are
04:38 - super affordable the early plans are
04:40 - only ten dollars a month
04:42 - also the first 500 people who click link
04:45 - down below will get two months free
04:47 - mobile skills
04:49 - [Music]
04:54 - [Music]
05:04 - so the third way how to make money is
05:06 - actually by creating the online products
05:09 - and selling them to people you can also
05:10 - do it in different ways first of all you
05:12 - can create some game or some app and put
05:15 - it on an online store and earn a lot of
05:17 - money through the ads or for some
05:19 - subscriptions like freemium games you
05:22 - know the premium games basically you put
05:24 - you gain for free but people are willing
05:27 - to pay for items in the game there are
05:29 - many of them you pay for the game and
05:31 - you enjoy with mobile apps we now have
05:33 - the ability to make games that are
05:34 - boring and stupid but if you pay for
05:37 - incentives you're rewarded premium the
05:40 - Miam is that not many other way is to
05:43 - create the SAS products as means
05:45 - software-as-a-service so basically you
05:48 - can create some API for example the API
05:51 - which will predict you the weather for
05:53 - next week I know that there's a couple
05:55 - of them and they already for free but
05:57 - you provide a good new product and
05:59 - market it well people are willing to pay
06:01 - you monthly for access to your API I saw
06:04 - some basic products such as generator of
06:06 - the random data' and I know that there
06:08 - are a lot of free ways to do that but
06:11 - there was like this one website and
06:12 - people were earning a lot of money you
06:14 - can check for example the nice website
06:16 - such as poker use of indie hackers
06:18 - people there are posting there bootstrap
06:20 - businesses they are earning money from 0
06:23 - to millions of dollars so you can do it
06:25 - definitely buy your own for example last
06:27 - time on a YouTube I posted a video about
06:29 - influence and marketing we got a stop
06:32 - here very quickly so basically this
06:33 - video is posted on my friend's channel
06:35 - clever programmer you can just check it
06:39 - check him out he's one of the most
06:41 - popular youtubers related to programming
06:44 - on YouTube and there's the video a
06:46 - building a simple Instagram influence at
06:48 - bot with Python it's about influences
06:51 - database so I highly recommend and I'll
06:53 - put the link to this video in the
06:55 - description and I created an online
06:58 - product which is online database of
07:00 - influencer if I will deep dive in this
07:02 - product and provide better features
07:04 - which with the detailed reports of an
07:07 - influencer in a certain niche I would
07:10 - also make create an online
07:11 - for it and use it as a
07:13 - software-as-a-service and charge monthly
07:15 - fees the other way is if you are for
07:19 - example front-end developer and it's
07:20 - hard for you to find like good clients
07:23 - which I want to have a nice website you
07:26 - can create the templates for example
07:28 - portfolio templates you can put it down
07:31 - on an online store and people are
07:33 - willing to pay for it let's say from 10
07:35 - to 20 euro spec template then if you
07:37 - market it well you are able to scale
07:40 - your business and earn money
07:46 - [Music]
08:04 - number four teach others get tutor be an
08:08 - online teacher or create the online
08:10 - courses I know that there are a lot of
08:12 - online courses and you don't want to
08:14 - become a next guru such as Tai Lopez
08:16 - here my garage just bought this new
08:19 - Lamborghini here you see this tik tok ER
08:23 - get in a little closer Johnny you in
08:25 - tighten up these guys are crazy you can
08:28 - actually provide a ton of value creating
08:30 - really high quality online course and
08:33 - helped a lot of people out there the
08:36 - other way is to actually just be it
08:38 - online tutor so basically there are many
08:40 - students who have problems with coding
08:42 - West problems will start and you can be
08:45 - an online tutor and church for example
08:46 - thirty to fifty dollars per hour for
08:49 - such a consulting session and again here
08:51 - it's all about building a personal brand
08:54 - it's all about marketing if people know
08:56 - you if people are following you they are
08:59 - willing to pay you the money they are
09:01 - willing to use your resources because
09:03 - they trust you they know that they will
09:05 - learn from you more than from some
09:07 - random udemy courses
09:09 - [Music]
09:22 - [Music]
09:26 - and the last which is the number five
09:29 - and this is my favorite is going to the
09:32 - coding contest so basically here I will
09:35 - focus mostly on the hackathons because
09:36 - I'm a huge fan of hackathon so basically
09:39 - I would suggest you first of all go
09:40 - there buy your own or with someone and
09:43 - just try it out see what is the
09:44 - hackathon what is it about how it is
09:47 - coding 24 hours per week but then if you
09:49 - are keep doing it you can have like one
09:51 - team for example of for coders they will
09:54 - be like one design and run from the
09:55 - engineer one patent engineer and the one
09:58 - DevOps then you are able to create the
10:00 - full products and win the hackathons I
10:03 - did that I went to six hackathons and I
10:06 - want four of them and basically you can
10:08 - get a really really good money and this
10:11 - is also some kind of like a side hustle
10:13 - not really regular and stable income but
10:16 - this is always good to have some extra
10:18 - cash with that
10:20 - [Music]
10:35 - [Music]
10:37 - [Applause]
10:38 - [Music]
10:50 - whirring where we go in are we going to
10:53 - extra crunch for absorption session

11:14 - [Music]
11:29 - [Music]
11:34 - alright guys so that were my five points
11:36 - how to make money with code if you have
