00:00 - um
00:05 - [ __ ] that's how this video should
00:07 - start
00:09 - yo guys what is up i wanted to learn
00:11 - react native so i thought
00:13 - what better way than to get two other
00:15 - badass developers with me
00:17 - from team cp and we just do it together
00:20 - so one of our hosts today is lam what's
00:23 - up lam
00:24 - what's up yo and then we got david in
00:27 - the house
00:27 - what's up guys this is gonna be a ton of
00:30 - fun
00:30 - and we're just gonna build [ __ ] on the
00:33 - fly we don't even know how it's gonna go
00:37 - [Music]
00:40 - i don't see [ __ ] dude why is this so
00:43 - [ __ ] hard to just do normal comments
00:45 - and stuff it's like
00:46 - add a text two hours later oh
00:50 - i know how to add text
00:53 - but we're gonna figure it out together
00:55 - my goal is to master react native and
00:57 - hopefully
00:58 - together we build something from scratch
00:59 - i think lem you already have some
01:01 - experience with react native right yeah
01:02 - i've got some experience i got some
01:04 - experience
01:04 - okay dope he's uh he always acts really
01:07 - humble but he's a badass so we're
01:09 - excited to see what we do
01:12 - okay cool so with that said um let's
01:15 - just go
01:15 - all right that was a good intro we did a
01:18 - good job guys
01:19 - okay so i'm gonna whip up a
01:22 - new react project right lem yep uh if i
01:26 - do something i probably can do
01:27 - um an expo project yes i will do expo
01:31 - what is it
01:31 - expo init the name of the project
01:34 - yeah i think so all right so that's it
01:36 - right do you know any of this david not
01:39 - really this is all new i mean i
01:40 - write it like once you excited to get
01:42 - your ass kicked david yeah yes
01:44 - that's how we learn and now let's open
01:46 - this bad boy up
01:47 - github practice react native learn react
01:49 - native open that [ __ ] app.js
01:51 - you aren't start can i do that can i do
01:54 - that yeah i'm gonna do
01:55 - ios simulator let's see you have like
01:58 - xcode and everything on there right yes
01:59 - i have xcode installed yeah because that
02:02 - install takes forever
02:03 - yeah what is happening oh it's working
02:06 - code okay that's a good sign yo guys i'm
02:08 - actually so excited like
02:10 - it takes so long though yeah initial
02:13 - render is uh
02:14 - is pretty painful because it has to you
02:16 - know convert everything but
02:18 - after that speeds up a little bit i
02:20 - don't know where your emulator is though
02:21 - it says running application on iphone 12
02:24 - pro mac is it on a different desktop
02:27 - let's check so now if we change this to
02:31 - let's change this text to you guys see
02:34 - the new update that i made to the app oh
02:35 - that's so cool
02:36 - yep let's go
02:40 - okay so i guess the first thing i'm
02:41 - going to do is just want to make it like
02:42 - dark mode enabled from
02:44 - the start so can i just change this
02:46 - color to freaking background color zero
02:48 - zero zero
02:48 - and like just type in color here and go
02:52 - uh white like that but why did the font
02:55 - color not change
02:56 - yeah it should be it should be color
02:58 - white i wonder if it is because we need
03:01 - to
03:02 - uh target the actual text um text
03:04 - element
03:05 - yeah that could be it like within the
03:07 - container the actual text element
03:10 - change text color and react
03:13 - what i find you have to give the text a
03:15 - style i think
03:17 - and then you could probably do it like
03:19 - oh wait wait
03:20 - wait i got you i got you i think we can
03:21 - do this look i think we can
03:23 - pass text the style right here and we
03:25 - can just go styles
03:27 - um styles like that and then i think you
03:31 - can do
03:32 - then we can go color white this maybe
03:35 - let's go to our app oh [ __ ]
03:37 - that worked because look at here
03:39 - essentially you can pass it a
03:42 - style whatever object kind of like this
03:44 - guy's doing like this you can pass that
03:46 - style just like that you know but i'm
03:48 - just
03:48 - actually giving it an object like you
03:50 - can literally take this thing here
03:53 - pop that in right there like that yeah
03:56 - but
03:56 - that's not in inline style that's not
03:59 - good
04:00 - yeah yeah yeah boom okay
04:03 - yes out of the box we have dark mode
04:06 - ready
04:06 - let's go whoa who the [ __ ] did that
04:10 - me cause i'm wait so you have to like
04:13 - add quotes in there
04:14 - i'm just testing it here okay try oh
04:17 - that worked
04:18 - okay go 800.
04:22 - so how do we do an h2 is there such a
04:24 - thing as h2
04:25 - lim uh no no it's just the uh
04:29 - just the text then you have to adjust
04:31 - from there you have to actually bring it
04:33 - up to like
04:33 - and when you do sizes it's like the if
04:35 - there's no pixel amounts it's just like
04:37 - a number
04:38 - uh and you'd have to size it manually oh
04:41 - the browser app
04:42 - okay so can we do font size
04:45 - is that yeah it's a thing yeah so can i
04:48 - give it ems or what what do i give it
04:50 - i mean no i can't i don't i don't think
04:52 - you can actually give it ems you have to
04:54 - actually give it like a number amount
04:56 - hey hey hey
05:09 - all right we just need to make our own
05:10 - whoa that looks
05:12 - cool so far more like an
05:15 - apple-ish thing all right that actually
05:18 - looks clean a react native framework
05:20 - is stunning okay get started
05:24 - but um so far so good let's
05:27 - let's see their github because that's
05:29 - what's gonna tell me if i should use
05:31 - them or not
05:31 - 8.1 k bro that's [ __ ] great
05:35 - and okay i kind of like the like the
05:38 - rounded corners and the playfulness of
05:40 - their design like that's the one thing i
05:42 - don't like about material ui like
05:44 - material ui looks like
05:45 - you develop for an android like it
05:48 - literally looks like
05:48 - you're an android developer and i
05:50 - [ __ ] hate that but like
05:52 - this looks very uh like kind of like
05:55 - delicious like you want to eat
05:56 - it's like i don't know it's nice clearly
05:59 - i'm a designer with my design
06:01 - design terminology you just have to say
06:04 - you know it uh it we we're making it pop
06:07 - and then you're a designer yeah making
06:10 - it pop
06:11 - yeah like look this makes it pop and it
06:13 - looks like um
06:14 - looks like 3d and cartoony and fun and
06:17 - inviting and playful
06:19 - i love the feel of that when i look at
06:21 - [ __ ] material ui it feels like you're
06:23 - going to text me and it's going to be a
06:24 - green blob of [ __ ] text and i'm just
06:26 - going to block
06:27 - you [ __ ] you yeah
06:30 - install into an existing app i mean we
06:32 - do have an existing app
06:35 - i'll tell you that we've done a lot of
06:36 - work on it so far
06:38 - beautiful using yarn yarn ad
06:42 - expo ah if you use expo you should
06:44 - install you should expo install like
06:46 - this
06:46 - oh nice but wouldn't whenever i do yarn
06:49 - add doesn't it already
06:51 - automatically change it to x-bow install
06:53 - because that's what i thought
06:54 - i don't know i just like even when i
06:56 - install because even when i do
06:58 - um yarn start it actually does expo
07:01 - start under under the hood
07:03 - oh yeah like i think in your uh your
07:05 - package.json it probably just says
07:07 - expo okay so let's install it on our
07:10 - expo
07:11 - hopefully our entire app will change and
07:13 - look beautiful
07:15 - right away boom
07:16 - [Laughter]
07:19 - what it didn't do everything damn
07:23 - ooh okay so i like when they give me
07:26 - code because that means i don't have to
07:28 - write it
07:30 - wrap the root component of your app into
07:33 - application provider
07:34 - so let's go to our app and let's just
07:37 - paste copy pasta that oh my god what
07:40 - could have possibly gone wrong
07:43 - [Laughter]
07:45 - let's see
07:50 - wait hold on you deleted the whole
07:51 - styling
07:55 - but what's the error saying it says
07:57 - could not be found
07:58 - but like i did install the did you
08:02 - uh did you uh import the layout
08:05 - wait hold on hold on hold on it says if
08:07 - you use expo use
08:08 - expo install react native svg but like
08:11 - look
08:11 - it never said ui kitten so or
08:15 - any of this that's confusing right
08:19 - yeah okay i'm just gonna
08:22 - type that do you see eva or kitten
08:25 - anywhere i don't see any of that
08:27 - i just see like regular looking stuff so
08:30 - i'm just going to do yarn add
08:32 - and let's see what happens that's kind
08:35 - of confusing directions on their end i
08:36 - think
08:38 - it was put on theme eva dark oh
08:42 - is it that easy oh dude that is so
08:45 - [ __ ] cool oh that makes me so happy
08:49 - i did nothing and everything worked
08:52 - that's what i like
08:53 - wow okay i i'm gonna be honest i even
08:55 - love the dark mode
08:56 - like i love the color they have in the
08:58 - background too i'm a huge fan
09:00 - not gonna lie i'm a huge fan of uh ui
09:03 - kitten already we strongly recommend
09:05 - paying
09:06 - enough attention on this guide in order
09:08 - to have develop a better developer
09:09 - experience
09:10 - important for me though
09:14 - okay so it's kind of like bootstrappy
09:16 - here we got the buttons
09:18 - so like let's put a button and let's
09:19 - give it like a success or primary and
09:22 - let's see what that looks like
09:23 - so who's going to put the button you
09:25 - guys want to do the honors of putting a
09:26 - button
09:27 - right underneath home yeah good one
09:30 - gonna be lamb because it didn't compile
09:32 - on my end
09:33 - should we how about how about this let's
09:35 - make like a clever programmer app
09:37 - so then one day we can put it in our app
09:38 - store and students can go
09:40 - and watch clever programmer videos or
09:42 - courses or whatever what do you guys
09:44 - think about that
09:44 - [ __ ] yes yeah okay [ __ ] it let's do it
09:48 - so i'm gonna change it from home to
09:51 - clever programmer because that i know
09:52 - how to do
09:53 - so i'm proud of that so you don't have
09:55 - to do that weird
09:57 - thing where you could title you can
09:59 - actually
10:01 - go old school and then we can write
10:04 - inside of it start
10:05 - learning and we'll just write two t's
10:10 - nice beautiful
10:13 - anybody want to add just a little margin
10:15 - between clever programmer and start
10:16 - learning
10:17 - we should try yeah yeah all right
10:20 - and um yeah let me let me try it
10:25 - okay oh and that's also cool we can have
10:27 - how many times a button was pressed
10:29 - and what i want to do is i want to have
10:32 - a
10:33 - counter and we'll do set counter
10:37 - and i'll do use state of zero nice
10:41 - so where did you add the margin bottom
10:44 - to the text um
10:48 - oh now i had to just set counter thing
10:50 - that's weird why did that not work
10:53 - perfect so you're incrementing the
10:54 - counter by one
10:56 - beautiful yep and where are we having
10:59 - the problem
11:00 - now i think it's in the
11:03 - stylesheet.create
11:06 - but i don't see the problem why is that
11:09 - a problem
11:09 - is mice are we not closing things
11:12 - properly is that what's happening
11:14 - that's exactly how it started starting
11:18 - spelling there's misspelling create okay
11:20 - now it should be
11:21 - oh wait can't
11:24 - find variable style sheet that's the
11:28 - [ __ ] problem do we have to import
11:30 - styles oh yeah
11:31 - yeah oh i have to import it from react
11:36 - native
11:39 - wait is it is it from react native or
11:43 - i think it's can we not get it from the
11:45 - kitten thing so let's look for style
11:47 - sheet here
11:48 - style no you can
11:51 - hold on guys so import oh yeah you okay
11:55 - so you import style sheet from react
11:57 - native you guys are right okay
11:59 - so style sheet just comes from react
12:00 - native so go ahead and import that
12:04 - there we go let's go nice
12:07 - all right so the 16.
12:11 - so i'm going to add another text right
12:13 - underneath here
12:15 - and we'll do text
12:20 - all right and then i'm just going to say
12:23 - um
12:25 - you clicked the button
12:29 - we'll go counter times
12:34 - nice is it actually working
12:38 - it looks like a potato the quality no
12:41 - it's working
12:42 - so yoho style dot um i'm gonna call this
12:46 - uh
12:48 - i'm gonna refactor this and we're gonna
12:50 - call
12:51 - rename symbol and call it a
12:54 - header text like this
12:57 - oh and then okay
13:01 - i'll do style equals styles dot
13:06 - paragraph text i mean i don't know if
13:08 - that's too verbose or not
13:11 - nice you're already on it paragraph text
13:14 - dude this is sick yeah rec native is fun
13:20 - this is [ __ ] good
13:23 - you added the margin to it that's
13:26 - interesting why is it not
13:29 - maybe just take some time huh maybe we
13:31 - just have to like
13:32 - i mean you added a huge margin bottom to
13:35 - paragraph
13:35 - text exactly
13:39 - style so let's see the documentation eh
13:43 - oh category h1 what the what is that oh
13:48 - that oh when you do that it all it
13:50 - actually uses the
13:52 - h1 built-in styling oh
13:55 - shh yeah wait so if i do
13:59 - over here paragraph text category
14:04 - uh equals p
14:07 - nothing change because i i guess that's
14:09 - the default how about h
14:11 - h4 it says unsupported configuration
14:19 - real quick
14:23 - text yeah margin bottom should be like
14:28 - hey look
14:30 - so it just took time to refresh but h4
14:33 - worked i think
14:35 - i just don't know why i'm not getting um
14:38 - i don't know what's happening with the
14:40 - margin though yeah because you
14:42 - because you added margin bottom yeah
14:44 - like
14:45 - big time
14:48 - why don't we just um why don't we just
14:52 - go to here let's do this
14:56 - let's take this out and we'll do styles
14:58 - no let's not do that
14:59 - yeah styles.container
15:03 - and then let's create container and and
15:06 - hold on hold on i got you i got you
15:07 - don't don't make the dictionary because
15:09 - i got
15:10 - or that object just one second hold on
15:12 - okay
15:14 - um dictionary python
15:17 - guy here
15:21 - [ __ ] you guys
15:26 - i mean we weren't the ones that didn't
15:29 - choose the right language to start with
15:34 - oh wait comma was in the wrong
15:39 - why does it like putting it in just one
15:41 - line
15:42 - where and nobody can see what it is but
15:44 - okay that's fine
15:46 - um now to this what we want to add is uh
15:49 - margin bottom right
15:51 - oh no that's not that's not going to do
15:53 - what we wanted to do
15:54 - i basically want every text element
15:57 - inside of
15:58 - this layout to have a margin bottom
16:02 - is there an easy way to do that uh
16:05 - yeah so what you can do is um
16:09 - i believe you can do embedded styles
16:13 - so like if you can just do that how do
16:16 - we do that if you can just show us
16:17 - i want to see how yeah if i remember
16:20 - correctly which one
16:21 - is it that we we're trying to fix we
16:23 - just want every element
16:25 - inside of this container to have a
16:27 - certain margin bottom like
16:28 - we also don't understand why like why is
16:31 - this margin bottom not working here for
16:32 - paragraph text
16:34 - let's start there i'll say um
16:37 - i mean the official documentation says
16:39 - margin bottle margin bottom works like
16:41 - margin dash bottom in css
16:47 - that's it should so basically
16:50 - every component has its own styling
16:53 - yeah it's looking that way well can you
16:56 - figure out
16:57 - why how can we add margin bottom to that
16:59 - paragraph text
17:01 - the button and the text is too close so
17:04 - why is that yeah
17:06 - yeah let's see pull up window
17:11 - david all right maybe put a margin top
17:14 - on the button
17:15 - okay that makes sense dang that margin
17:18 - top is not working for the oh
17:19 - wait some margin takes a while
17:23 - no it's not that it just takes a while
17:24 - the paragraph text margin bottom is like
17:26 - not working at all
17:28 - but the margin top is working because if
17:31 - i
17:31 - if i had 32 on the bottom uh button
17:35 - you have to save it like multiple times
17:37 - but like
17:38 - this line here is just like not doing
17:40 - anything i don't think
17:42 - yeah how about giving it like
17:46 - an 800 just to like throw it off
17:51 - yeah that threw it off
17:54 - okay so it kind of works so
17:57 - if margin bottom just mysteriously
17:59 - doesn't work then just
18:01 - try to aim for margin top i guess wait
18:04 - wait wait
18:05 - let's let's try that because can you
18:08 - you save it too all right let's just
18:11 - move on so we figured this out we don't
18:13 - need to now obsess over it so we got
18:15 - this i think
18:17 - we don't need the paragraph text
18:20 - all right so that's good now what else
18:23 - should we add guys
18:25 - um i would say let's go with user
18:28 - authentication
18:30 - because we need that definitely or we
18:32 - can just put the uh
18:34 - i think we're gonna need yeah let's do
18:36 - more front end stuff for now
18:38 - like i would like to add like cards
18:40 - where people could see the courses or
18:42 - something at the top you know like a
18:43 - javascript course
18:45 - um pwj like i don't know like a
18:48 - javascript course a pwg
18:49 - course something like that you know and
18:51 - then a bottom where we have
18:53 - like maybe home and then
18:56 - we got something else that would be
18:58 - really good
19:00 - yeah let's look at the um
19:03 - ui and see if they have a bottom
19:07 - uh bottom at bar kind of thing
19:10 - there you go i think bottom tabs might
19:12 - be what we're looking for perfect
19:14 - i'm gonna follow you then all right and
19:17 - look at their code
19:19 - let's see they got a really simple uses
19:21 - example here down at the uh at the
19:22 - bottom of the uh
19:24 - bottom of the help it looks like we only
19:26 - need like two components
19:28 - let's see
19:32 - which one are you looking at the
19:35 - uh so on the uh the tabs uh bottom tabs
19:39 - help it's the very last entry
19:43 - oh that uh the users
19:47 - with the star right yeah yeah just with
19:49 - the start just to uh
19:51 - just to get that one you know that one
19:53 - uh example going
19:57 - wait so we need the star icon so that's
20:00 - that's the thing
20:04 - where it complaining about
20:09 - did you import it oh wait uh
20:13 - yeah wait would it be working if i did
20:17 - it like there you go
20:22 - but it's not showing
20:26 - or what if
20:32 - well it's not showing because you're oh
20:34 - you added it in my bed
20:37 - yeah all right i just added it in yeah
20:40 - yeah
20:41 - can you make the name of it a little bit
20:43 - more complicated
20:46 - that's how it was in documentation
20:48 - [Laughter]
20:54 - let's see i can't remember what the
20:56 - error says
20:59 - kazia made it a little more complicated
21:01 - just worry
21:05 - piece of [ __ ]
21:07 - [Laughter]
21:13 - let's see but hold on
21:17 - what is the [ __ ] error saying like i
21:20 - don't know
21:20 - i don't see it that's what i was saying
21:23 - you didn't [ __ ] import it that's what
21:24 - i was like dude did you import it you're
21:25 - like yeah i was like
21:27 - okay but then i went because i imported
21:29 - it okay where
21:31 - because i don't see any import
21:35 - it's right there bottom level this is
21:36 - what it is icon
21:38 - eva icons pack
21:41 - i mean i could still be wrong but let's
21:43 - see
21:45 - am i still wrong holy [ __ ]
21:49 - yes you are
21:52 - uh yeah yeah you're a kid in components
21:56 - yeah
22:03 - we need icon registry apparently
22:14 - all the odds and ends we need wait i
22:17 - have no idea what's happening here
22:19 - icons pack name
22:22 - so it's not registered with the registry
22:24 - service
22:26 - show me what you're using as example
22:27 - code
22:29 - sure
22:32 - so can you guys link it in slack
22:36 - whatever the stuff you're looking at
22:37 - because i think the problem that's
22:39 - happening is um
22:41 - it's not registered with the icon
22:43 - registry service or whatever that
22:45 - supposed to mean because that's what the
22:46 - first stack
22:48 - error says says unidentified object
22:52 - ufo alright so you guys uh did this
22:55 - right navigation container and create
22:57 - bottom tab navigator
23:00 - um i was looking at the one to the uh
23:02 - the example at the very bottom
23:05 - the super simple one with one uh
23:08 - oh my god that is so beautiful
23:11 - [ __ ] what it's [ __ ] good
23:15 - what example this one the super simple
23:17 - one this one
23:18 - nope yeah it's like yep right up right
23:21 - at the bottom
23:22 - no it's not even more simple very bottom
23:24 - one that one
23:25 - oh okay so you guys did that
23:29 - and then you're i was looking at it i
23:31 - haven't i haven't uh i haven't tried yet
23:33 - okay let me know i don't know which one
23:35 - uh you're using david
23:36 - so david got so did you do bottom
23:38 - navigation tab
23:40 - yeah you did okay we don't need this for
23:42 - now so i'm gonna remove that too
23:44 - so we got icon bottom navigation tab
23:47 - it's being imported from
23:49 - ui kitted components um
23:53 - and then icon like that
23:56 - so where's your icon show me your icon
24:00 - yeah it's under export default which
24:04 - might be [ __ ] things up i'm just
24:07 - gonna like uh
24:08 - put it over here that's probably not the
24:12 - problem
24:13 - wait we're getting a better problem now
24:16 - star
24:16 - icon you're passing it in
24:20 - something with props name star
24:23 - okay and then your bottom sheet icon
24:26 - you're giving it this yeah
24:28 - autumn sheet giving it a star icon okay
24:31 - um i think you might need to put these
24:33 - in the right order
24:35 - let's like put it put it in the right
24:37 - order you know like let's build it first
24:39 - and then our app is gonna get access to
24:41 - it
24:42 - um so you mean like on the top
24:46 - whoa
24:50 - what is happening here
24:54 - okay can't find variable so star icon
24:58 - you're clearly describing what a star
25:00 - icon
25:01 - is um is it returning an expression you
25:05 - might not be returning anything here you
25:06 - might have to put it in parentheses
25:08 - so you can retrieve no you don't have to
25:10 - because
25:12 - when you're working with arrow functions
25:13 - it works immediately
25:15 - like it's it's just gonna uh return one
25:18 - thing
25:19 - without the parents but if you put the
25:21 - parents you can like
25:22 - put more stuff in there okay
25:32 - evaluating icons evaluating
25:37 - icons pack dot name
25:40 - i love github issues and it's closed so
25:42 - that's a good sign
25:44 - i guess you forgot to register an icon
25:46 - package
25:52 - and sometimes it's just like the owners
25:55 - like [ __ ] it
25:57 - so we never installed eva icons i don't
25:59 - think guys or no did we
26:02 - uh i don't think so you sure
26:05 - i thought this was the first thing we
26:06 - did no okay let's go here well
26:09 - it wasn't that big list of uh if it was
26:12 - a big list of yarn stuff
26:14 - yeah we did not do eva icons actually
26:17 - that's why we don't have them
26:18 - so let's do eva icons and then i don't
26:22 - think we need to do react natives
26:24 - svg because we've already installed that
26:25 - so let's install this
26:28 - and that should work because really it's
26:30 - the problem but it's not
26:32 - recognizing the icon so we should i
26:34 - think it should work now let's hit save
26:37 - weird
26:41 - do i have to do it the way they did it
26:43 - like
26:44 - darn add and then like plus react native
26:47 - svg like that i don't think that should
26:48 - make any difference right
26:50 - um register icons that is what we need
26:54 - to do
26:54 - because even if you look at the error
26:56 - the first error starts with some
26:57 - registry [ __ ]
26:59 - so oh [ __ ] i was on the right track son
27:02 - suckas i was on the frickin right track
27:06 - way before you fools okay
27:09 - we're gonna also need icon
27:11 - [Music]
27:15 - registry i like how in their example
27:18 - like they don't freaking
27:20 - show this yeah so in the default
27:25 - um you need to actually register the
27:28 - icons
27:29 - so like right here you actually need to
27:32 - register all your icons like
27:34 - that why am i getting a big fat red
27:36 - error oh okay
27:37 - just wrap it in jsx element i guess um
27:40 - like this okay
27:44 - [ __ ] my life
27:48 - are we so we are getting icon
27:51 - registry that's good i am getting
27:55 - that i've installed it too we are doing
27:59 - this
27:59 - here as well
28:02 - um registry
28:07 - eva icons pack so that's the icons pack
28:10 - we're using
28:13 - within our app oh wait am i ending the
28:16 - freaking thing yeah i am
28:20 - what's the error i don't understand yeah
28:24 - let's go [ __ ]
28:32 - [Applause]
28:37 - see how easy that was guys
28:40 - [Laughter]
28:42 - yeah oh these are nice
28:48 - father father icon
28:56 - okay
29:00 - let's see what type of cards they got
29:05 - i mean we could also add a chessboard
29:12 - i'm sure our students would have the
29:14 - need for that
29:16 - yeah like how is like code academy app
29:19 - laid out let me actually go see
29:20 - codecademy or something or like um what
29:23 - are those like popular code apps like
29:26 - uh solo learn
29:29 - so learn um
29:36 - i know like uh codementor io
29:44 - i don't know i think like i see uh uh
29:46 - play
29:48 - just learn like in i might bring it just
29:50 - like freaking scream
29:53 - oh i love scrimba
29:57 - okay this is a cool landing page so take
29:59 - a look at this guys i'm gonna drop it in
30:01 - our chat
30:01 - in slack
30:07 - um what are our names
30:10 - [Music]
30:11 - [Laughter]
30:15 - so this is uh memo which is like one of
30:18 - the most popular coding applications
30:20 - this is their landing page
30:23 - um the email should come to us in about
30:27 - i mean it's just a photo there we go
30:34 - okay
30:36 - so let me go downloads

30:54 - okay i actually know a side which
30:56 - generates an svg

31:01 - nice wavy svg generator let's
31:04 - try it wavy svg
31:09 - get waves.i o
31:12 - i think that's exactly it let me let me
31:15 - see it i have it bookmarked but how do i
31:17 - apply
31:18 - this image here that's that's that's
31:20 - that
31:21 - it's down there it's down there like you
31:23 - can download it uh there is a download
31:24 - button
31:25 - somewhere and you just like you will get
31:28 - the the
31:29 - yeah that exact svg vegeta you see that
31:31 - blue thing

31:39 - image into it that's what i'm saying
31:43 - oh that's not happening there so this is
31:46 - not what i want
31:47 - this is just the wave i want one where
31:50 - you give it an
31:50 - image i want one where you give it an
31:53 - image and then it gives you
31:54 - i mean it's cool to have a wave don't
31:56 - get me wrong that's [ __ ]
31:58 - so but i want to have a landing page
32:00 - like theirs
32:04 - i mean we can just sketch it together

32:16 - the svg you like you have an image and
32:18 - then just put the two oh
32:19 - how about this i got an idea let's use
32:23 - how do can i flip this upside down oh
32:26 - perfect
32:27 - yep um
32:32 - nah that's gonna look weird
32:39 - i'm trying to think how we can make it
32:41 - work
32:43 - um let's see her photo again
32:49 - let's go to downloads
32:54 - so like how do we get this
32:57 - thing
33:01 - like i'm sure there's some way right lem
33:05 - holy [ __ ] is 11 shock or what
33:08 - can you guys hear me
33:12 - here we are i've been on mute this whole
33:14 - time
33:18 - how do we do this
33:22 - uh i'm thinking that we're going to have
33:24 - to we're going to have to build an svg
33:26 - i can do that and uh real quick okay
33:30 - yeah do you wanna okay that's dope
33:34 - let's do that
33:39 - all right let's see grab my pen tool
33:44 - is my internet so back
33:49 - let's see
33:54 - that's got kind of a subtle wave to it
33:59 - bring an iphone frame
34:06 - i mean there's gotta be a website that
34:08 - does this to be honest i just
34:10 - can't freaking
34:18 - um
34:21 - let's see svg
34:25 - generator
34:32 - like
34:38 - their second page is really freaking
34:41 - dope as well actually
34:42 - i'll air drop it to myself
34:51 - i mean it's pretty much the same it's
34:52 - just a different photo they're using
34:54 - which
34:56 - looks pretty freaking cool
35:00 - this is the one
35:04 - oh sh i really like this
35:08 - like the photo they're using and
35:09 - everything's like super sick
35:18 - let's see so i think i think if we use
35:21 - this wave generator
35:22 - we can like um we can
35:25 - put the svg that generates
35:30 - uh like one like that on top and then
35:32 - like
35:35 - make the make a div under it the same
35:37 - color
35:42 - um
35:48 - can't in photoshop you just create a
35:51 - shape like yeah with the with pen tool
35:56 - right so you should be able to create a
35:58 - shape like this and then just pop an
36:00 - image in there right i mean i don't know
36:02 - how to exactly do that in photoshop but
36:03 - i know that should be possible
36:06 - yeah i'm actually um i'm in figment now
36:10 - i'm gonna load uh an iphone frame just
36:12 - so i can get
36:13 - a good reference uh-huh do you want me
36:17 - to send this over to you in slack i'll
36:19 - drop this in slack as well
36:24 - okay
36:27 - um interesante
36:38 - i like the font to create a profile to
36:40 - save your progress
36:42 - and then this one is start learning to
36:44 - code
36:45 - so let's actually david let's build this
36:48 - while he builds an image okay let's like
36:50 - okay this right here with the [ __ ]
36:54 - like the whole thing let's just model
36:56 - this exact thing
36:58 - okay
36:58 - [Music]
37:02 - and you got the image right uh yeah
37:06 - yeah can you unfuck up whatever you
37:08 - [ __ ] up bro please
37:22 - uh uh collaborative programming words
37:25 - [Laughter]
37:30 - yo david so first of all this is a
37:32 - bottom navigation tab right but it's
37:34 - like smack in the middle of the screen
37:36 - so how do we fix that what do you mean
37:40 - it's smacking
37:41 - oh you mean like you want to put it like
37:43 - down there or some [ __ ]
37:45 - yeah i want to put it down there that's
37:47 - exactly what i want to do
37:51 - let me give it a style because
37:58 - what the [ __ ] because what else is the
38:00 - point of bottom navigation tab
38:02 - if it's not going to put [ __ ] at the
38:03 - bottom you know what i mean like
38:06 - oh because because we're centering our
38:09 - [ __ ] right like
38:10 - we're centering our entire freaking
38:13 - so let's not do that let's remove a line
38:16 - items
38:18 - you probably do uh if the containers if
38:21 - it's parents containers flex
38:23 - one you can do uh margin top as auto
38:28 - how about we use display grid instead of
38:31 - [ __ ] flex
38:32 - cause uh it's just better hold on hold
38:34 - on hold on hold on
38:35 - let's before we bring out our bazooka
38:37 - let's just use our brains a little bit
38:40 - [Laughter]
38:44 - this guy's always ready to throw in the
38:46 - [ __ ] kitchen sink at every problem
38:51 - so margin auto so
38:54 - okay so i mean it won't stop refreshing
38:57 - what the [ __ ] is happening
38:59 - oh because david will not stop writing
39:02 - code i see
39:05 - you know what i'm just gonna like put my
39:07 - hands up
39:08 - no no no no you're doing good i'm just
39:10 - seeing don't touch the keyboard
39:13 - okay okay you're fine david you're fine
39:15 - i just wanted to see what it might be
39:17 - so okay so margin top auto worked but it
39:21 - moved everything
39:25 - no position absolutes okay fine
39:30 - why because is that isn't that like
39:33 - doesn't that lead to a [ __ ] ton of
39:34 - problems oh bottom nav okay okay
39:37 - okay okay okay okay i see what you're
39:39 - doing okay i can [ __ ] with that that's
39:41 - cool
39:42 - that's cool i'm gonna then what i'm
39:44 - gonna do is i'm gonna make a position of
39:46 - this relative
39:48 - okay i mean i think that that should be
39:50 - the initial
39:52 - state though but but yeah yeah
39:55 - i don't think so that's what pro uh css
39:58 - developers tell me
40:00 - it's a happening make the parent
40:03 - relative and make the child absolute
40:06 - okay um
40:11 - is it not working i mean in real life
40:15 - most of the times the parent is a
40:17 - relative of the sun
40:22 - so
40:31 - um so david what did you do
40:37 - did you get that joke pills today but by
40:40 - the way
40:40 - i i might have but i don't what
40:43 - pills did you [ __ ] get that [ __ ] up
40:45 - the whole app every time
40:48 - code [ __ ] you know what i'm just gonna
40:50 - [ __ ] this
40:51 - like not do it what
40:55 - invalid position of value ab but you
40:59 - never wrote ab you wrote absolute i'm
41:01 - not understanding
41:03 - i think it's my abs that it's probably
41:10 - uh hold on do you guys see the error
41:13 - because i don't understand it
41:16 - i just removed all the styling on that
41:19 - did my server just die
41:22 - could have i just killed it from here
41:26 - i'm just gonna yarn start remote
41:29 - colleague
41:29 - kills american company servers
41:33 - but you did that i didn't
41:42 - you developers smashes the whole company
41:50 - oh man um okay
41:55 - so
41:59 - all right
42:02 - wait i can just stick this right in the
42:04 - freaking folder hold on a sec
42:06 - about to put my graphic into the assets
42:09 - how about we put all the content in
42:11 - first and then worry about
42:13 - oh [ __ ] he's about to drop it in assets
42:15 - that's [ __ ] sick
42:17 - um guys why is this like should i close
42:21 - this [ __ ] simulator or what
42:22 - the [ __ ] is happening opening oh it's
42:26 - still
42:26 - opening huh interesting
42:30 - opening okay it's taking its sweet time
42:35 - [Music]
42:37 - oh i know the svg is going to work i'll
42:39 - make a ping too
42:40 - all right so is there a reason why this
42:42 - is taking so [ __ ]
42:44 - long
42:47 - that's weird right like there's some
42:49 - weird [ __ ] with like whenever you're
42:51 - doing react native development like
42:52 - normal common sense stuff like doesn't
42:56 - work
42:59 - probably because we don't do that too
43:01 - much and it's just a lack of experience
43:03 - but
43:05 - module parse failed
43:08 - what is that we you may need an
43:11 - appropriate
43:12 - loader to handle this file currently no
43:14 - loaders are configured
43:15 - to process this file uh
43:20 - okay well everything was working so what
43:24 - changed
43:26 - what did we add that
43:30 - had that impact
43:35 - because we were good here
43:40 - oh [ __ ] son
43:45 - i don't know if you're going to be able
43:46 - to use the svg so uh
43:49 - i'm i'm also going to stick a a png in
43:51 - that folder
43:53 - okay oh so what you're doing
43:57 - is what you want to do is put a regular
43:59 - image and then
44:01 - put the svg on top of that with like a
44:03 - higher z index
44:05 - [Music]
44:07 - or something is that what you're trying
44:09 - well so
44:10 - well what i actually just made a uh
44:14 - g that would uh that would cover the
44:16 - bottom like uh portion of the page
44:18 - and yeah we can put like a we can put
44:20 - that to like a z index of like
44:22 - negative one something like that and
44:23 - then uh have it under everything
44:26 - okay oh
44:32 - yeah i want to give my folder open here
44:38 - bottom dot png
44:42 - i mean david don't don't be sad we'll
44:44 - add in the
44:46 - authentication as soon as the first
44:48 - landing page is built
44:50 - thank you i'm so happy now like
44:55 - i can't even tell how happy this is
45:04 - man at least that [ __ ] will break
45:07 - um
45:10 - okay so
45:12 - [Music]
45:14 - does it seem so my app is just gone
45:18 - like just straight up just [ __ ] gone
45:20 - like
45:22 - [Music]
45:23 - is it there for you guys i'm just
45:25 - getting errors on like fail to compile
45:29 - let me try uh you may need an
45:33 - appropriate loader so i'm gonna
45:35 - google that let's see stack overflow 126
45:39 - upvotes npm
45:43 - install babel preset yes 2015.
45:47 - wait hold on this is uh let me let the
45:50 - world know that we're
45:51 - working with react native here in all
45:54 - caps
45:59 - i've been banging my head against the
46:01 - wall all day trying to figure out is
46:03 - this guy okay
46:07 - hope he's not dead
46:12 - um
46:15 - it still says react and not react native
46:18 - even though i wrote react native in all
46:19 - caps
46:23 - would we still have to do this babble
46:26 - crap
46:28 - i haven't before
46:32 - i guess you'll resolve more incorrectly
46:35 - closing the upper property try this
46:42 - loaders
46:45 - presets react es 215
46:48 - [Music]
46:50 - um okay
46:57 - i'll see so
47:01 - why do we need that because everything
47:03 - was working up until now so i'm not
47:04 - going to do that solution because it
47:06 - just sounds
47:07 - silly to me like did somebody in here go
47:11 - and change app.json
47:14 - or our babble config
47:19 - babel preset expo so that looks
47:23 - like normal to me
47:26 - and then where's our loader
47:30 - [Music]
47:33 - hello loader where the hell is our
47:36 - loader
47:38 - let's see you know
47:42 - what's what's the uh the error rate
47:43 - again
47:45 - um the error is saying
47:50 - module parse failed you may need an
47:54 - appropriate loader to handle this file
47:56 - type
47:56 - currently no loaders are configured to
47:59 - process this file
48:01 - but we have the loader that we don't
48:03 - need image or
48:05 - or an icon or anything
48:08 - i mean we do have an icon but that icon
48:11 - we had the whole time
48:13 - everything was working um
48:18 - fine but then i think david did
48:21 - something and
48:22 - and it changed so do you remember your
48:26 - last couple of changes david
48:38 - the thing the the style for that uh
48:44 - that stuff right there okay
48:48 - so
48:51 - so let's try that real quick because
48:53 - that's when things were working
48:59 - let me go back to our app
49:03 - [Music]
49:07 - nope still still [ __ ] up
49:12 - um should i just remove
49:16 - that right there
49:19 - [Music]
49:29 - the problem is happening inside of
49:33 - input.component.js on line 105.
49:41 - are we using any inputs i don't think so
49:47 - not at all do you even have input
49:51 - imported in
49:54 - nope react
49:59 - react native
50:03 - native expo loader
50:12 - [Music]
50:18 - why did we change bro what the [ __ ]
50:23 - um i'm just gonna start it again it's
50:26 - like if it won't run we can't really
50:28 - make any progress you know like we
50:30 - literally
50:31 - need to be able to at least see it right
50:34 - try compiling now i got rid of the uh
50:37 - um the svg that was in
50:41 - the assets oh it might be the [ __ ]
50:45 - svg
50:46 - you're right that was the new change
50:47 - that we added
50:49 - let me actually look react native assets
50:52 - svg how to use svgs with
50:56 - react native yeah you have to actually
50:59 - have a
51:00 - bring in a loader so that might be it i
51:03 - do have react native svg by the way we
51:05 - have installed that already
51:08 - okay um but like where to add svgs is
51:12 - the question
51:13 - um ah see look we need a transformer
51:18 - that does this [ __ ] this is what we need
51:19 - to do
51:20 - you see all this we need a
51:23 - metroconfig.js
51:24 - and babel needs to know how to transform
51:27 - the path
51:28 - for the svgs that's why we were having
51:30 - the problem
51:32 - and then in your assets you could add
51:34 - svgs
51:35 - i think our app is going to compile now
51:37 - with the svg not there
51:40 - like so far i don't see any problems and
51:42 - like yeah i don't get any errors at all
51:44 - let's hit w open in the web browser
51:49 - project is running at 1906. let's hit
51:52 - enter
51:53 - wait why do i still have that problem
51:55 - you took it out right
51:57 - yeah uh
52:01 - let's try it on the land
52:04 - wait a minute is there like do we have
52:07 - to clean up cash
52:09 - there is a way it might be worth it look
52:12 - the app is loading
52:13 - it's bundling boom the app is there [ __ ]
52:16 - yeah
52:17 - so it was that 3g good [ __ ] debugging
52:21 - um i think we're going to have to use
52:24 - this transformer
52:26 - um
52:30 - this looks way too complicated yeah
52:36 - right like shouldn't that be the why
52:37 - don't i just go with a [ __ ] png
52:41 - well like with rack native anyways like
52:43 - all of your images are loaded
52:46 - to uh um in s3 instance
52:49 - a what instance um uh
52:52 - amazon storage oh really yeah
52:56 - let's look at react native transformer
52:59 - and if this has
53:00 - a [ __ ] ton of github stars then that
53:02 - means we should use it
53:03 - if it doesn't then it's probably a scam
53:07 - um okay
53:11 - so i believe we'd be able to make svg's
53:14 - work
53:15 - my friend but we would have to go this
53:18 - route
53:19 - do you guys want to go this route
53:22 - uh not really
53:26 - all right i mean if there's any easier
53:28 - way so what's the solution
53:30 - the solution is to go png yeah i think
53:33 - the solution is to go png
53:35 - okay so for example david take note of
53:37 - one hour and 36 minutes when we decided
53:40 - to scratch
53:40 - svgs and go png's that might be a good
53:43 - note to add and then you can actually
53:44 - drop that in the video as well
53:47 - okay uh-huh okay
53:50 - so quick quick quick quick quick
53:55 - all right i want to see what interesting
53:58 - so we got cards
53:59 - card statuses
54:08 - nice not exactly what i was imagining
54:11 - when i was thinking cards but okay
54:13 - um can you help okay so cool
54:17 - so let's um let's make damage work now
54:19 - right lamb
54:22 - okay so let's add the image to the home
54:24 - page
54:34 - um app
54:37 - app
54:41 - actually let's look at dribble for
54:43 - inspiration i totally forgot we can do
54:45 - that
54:46 - [ __ ] yeah because dribble is just the
54:48 - [ __ ]

56:37 - through like
56:38 - certain things that could be cool um do
56:40 - you guys not want it to be dark themed

57:56 - whenever you're working on these kind of
57:58 - stuff let me know
57:59 - me too seriously like this this type of
58:02 - design if i can do this

64:01 - is that um they have the image
64:04 - as like um as like z index like
64:08 - zero or something like that right and
64:10 - then they added the waves over it
64:12 - yeah okay so david we can work on this
64:15 - right
64:15 - yep okay let's work on this then and we
64:18 - can add oh yeah

65:05 - somewhere
65:07 - where is the image um let's use
65:10 - um

65:34 - oh [ __ ] yo
65:39 - this is a this is mobile development for
65:41 - you just adding an image just [ __ ]
65:44 - takes like our lives experience and
65:46 - swift it was so much easier
65:49 - nah react native is way easier i think

65:52 - wait hold on so now let's what's uh
65:56 - let's
65:57 - now we're making progress dude i'm

70:19 - top one oh two two three three
70:22 - there is the eye thing and just uncheck
70:24 - the eye

70:28 - absolute this to be just
70:29 - right below oh wait no no i can i can
70:33 - position absolute this and i can
70:34 - override it onto the image right
70:37 - [Music]
70:38 - uh yeah exactly exactly yeah
70:43 - but like you can also do and i think
70:46 - that's that's better
70:48 - if uh if we do margin negative
70:52 - that's a dope app by the way it's called
70:54 - uh
70:55 - opted high gay yeah uh
70:58 - where the [ __ ] did it go right there
71:03 - [Music]
71:05 - like it even gives blurry gradient and
71:08 - all that [ __ ] that we
71:09 - need for exactly i just discovered it
71:12 - today
71:13 - i mean right now right after i
71:16 - discovered it or not
71:17 - no no i i was messing with it earlier
71:21 - um yeah where is it a project
71:26 - all right so i will add it like that
71:32 - wait it was supposed to be a [ __ ] png
71:35 - but it's doing some weird ass [ __ ] now
71:36 - [Music]
71:38 - i'm gonna call it uh
71:41 - upside down upd
71:48 - and instead i will do
71:53 - require
71:54 - [Music]
71:56 - and hopefully it's gonna [ __ ] everything
71:58 - up forever
72:00 - yay it did i don't know
72:03 - dot slash dot slash like that
72:08 - speed yes
72:14 - okay now what i need to do
72:18 - is give it us uh let's go and drop in
72:22 - touchable opacity like this
72:26 - let's what's that let's wrap this image
72:28 - in touchable opacity
72:31 - what's the touchable opacity um
72:36 - i'll show you and now we can actually
72:37 - give it styling as well
72:39 - so let's give it styling and we'll do
72:42 - styles dot um
72:46 - waves or something that makes sense
72:49 - yeah okay and then let's go here
72:52 - and let's go waves
72:56 - and position
72:59 - [Music]
73:02 - absolute
73:04 - and let's go margin top
73:08 - you need to give it an uh position to be
73:11 - actually absolute
73:13 - oh [ __ ] disconnected
73:16 - what disconnected skype
73:24 - wait why did the app disconnect
73:30 - hello why did the app disconnect what
73:34 - the [ __ ]
73:35 - that's weird it looks stupid on the
73:38 - simulator but on my phone it's actually
73:40 - not looking too bad
73:46 - that's half
73:51 - there
73:54 - okay um
73:59 - margin top 200
74:03 - margin top 200 again
74:06 - 2 000
74:09 - that's nothing [ __ ]
74:14 - um
74:18 - i just want to like put it here you know
74:25 - isn't that what we're supposed to do or
74:26 - what
74:28 - yeah uh i mean like i'm supposed to like
74:31 - i'm
74:32 - i'm trying to add it to the top of that
74:34 - but that's not going to do anything
74:35 - right that's not
74:36 - going to do what we want it to do is it
74:40 - because if i my gut feeling says
74:44 - okay can we wrap the two images together
74:47 - and then just put the second one on the
74:49 - bottom
74:51 - like the waves in the bottom
74:54 - the waves at the bottom
74:57 - hold on um
75:01 - okay if you want to try that as long as
75:03 - just
75:05 - i think we don't [ __ ] up any cash
75:06 - related thing
75:12 - what do you mean wrap the two images
75:14 - what do you mean by that
75:17 - i'm in like the
75:22 - um i don't think they're like divs i
75:24 - mean you could put it in like a view
75:26 - you could put it in a view yeah
75:30 - but like they already are interviews i
75:32 - don't understand like what's the point
75:34 - of that
75:36 - so i mean wait uh
75:39 - okay go for it girlfriend i'm in view
75:43 - like this boom and then
75:47 - put this here
75:52 - and yeah it's
75:56 - acting up let's go and instead of
76:00 - like this i would do
76:07 - images
76:10 - wait misspelled style
76:14 - oh
76:19 - hold on the problem is i can't find view
76:21 - read the error dude
76:24 - doesn't mean oh we gotta import it is it
76:27 - not important
76:28 - no i don't think so that's important
76:34 - what okay
76:37 - this is this boom
76:42 - there bam
76:46 - okay
76:50 - and now i would do like
76:53 - this
76:57 - here something like this
77:05 - uh why doesn't it center this image
77:10 - can you show the app can see it
77:14 - ice cream okay let's
77:17 - learn from this because these guys got
77:22 - well but that's not what we want right
77:24 - we want um
77:27 - how like what are these hold on i'm not
77:30 - conceptually [ __ ] understanding
77:32 - something like i think
77:33 - that's more important to understand so
77:38 - these waves here are just white waves
77:41 - right or what what the [ __ ] is this
77:44 - yeah that's a white wave that goes from
77:46 - the very bottom
77:48 - all the way to almost the middle where
77:50 - it covers the
77:51 - image which probably would take up the
77:54 - whole screen anyway
77:57 - okay so we are
78:02 - so the image really needs to be a
78:04 - background image then right
78:07 - actually that makes sense so let's go
78:10 - ahead and make our first of all let's go
78:12 - and make our image
78:13 - background image first so let's go
78:16 - react native background image
78:20 - let's start off there let's just keep
78:21 - [ __ ] simple and go from there
78:24 - so yeah i've used this before
78:27 - image background perfect
78:34 - so let's import image background
78:38 - here and then the first
78:41 - guy we're going to make it image
78:43 - background
78:45 - no no not your waves right there
78:50 - wait what is [ __ ] happening no no you
78:52 - want this uh the first
78:54 - one i don't want it in the [ __ ] wavy
78:58 - image
78:58 - styling i want it on its own right
79:02 - okay um
79:04 - [Music]
79:06 - am i not seeing it because it's a
79:08 - background image
79:14 - wait resize okay you you need to add
79:17 - a couple of styling stuff so there's a
79:19 - resize mode
79:20 - wait what's the error happening here
79:22 - style that what the [ __ ] is this error
79:24 - every time i comment out your view
79:25 - [Music]
79:29 - hold up with what
79:32 - is it because oh this is this is
79:40 - but isn't it an object should be like
79:42 - that yeah
79:43 - makes sense okay i don't know that's an
79:47 - integer
79:47 - oh what
79:51 - [Music]
79:53 - um let's actually do
79:57 - what this [ __ ] what
80:01 - where'd i do this instead this is what
80:04 - the
80:04 - documentation i can see it says
80:08 - like ah wait wait okay
80:12 - so so the container
80:16 - needs to be flex one flex direction
80:18 - column
80:19 - for some reason i don't care now let's
80:22 - just
80:22 - add it um
80:26 - okay do whatever you want i'm gonna look
80:28 - in
80:29 - oh okay okay that makes sense container
80:32 - flex
80:33 - one so yeah container flex one and flex
80:36 - direction column it's or it's uh i just
80:38 - add it there
80:39 - uh let me just comment these out for
80:41 - real quick
80:42 - see how that hap how that will turn out
80:58 - now we just need like we don't need you
81:02 - bro this is exciting
81:06 - um wow damn that's sick as [ __ ]
81:12 - [Music]
81:13 - um wait wait wait wait wait wait
81:16 - but i want this to be the same color as
81:19 - that dark mode screen that we had
81:21 - because that was sick
81:23 - okay we just need to uh change the color
81:27 - there but not touching anything else
81:29 - [Music]
81:30 - you're you're at the right place yep so
81:33 - that's where you set the color
81:35 - like i think like that color ah
81:39 - that's i think that's too dark so what
81:42 - was that
81:42 - color that it gave us like that
81:46 - uh-huh something like that i i think
81:48 - yeah
81:49 - yo bro like there is the ui kitten
81:52 - dark mode color hold on let's get rabbit
81:56 - from them because they had a pretty nice
81:57 - uh
81:58 - dark theme color going on it was this
82:02 - one right it was one of these i think
82:03 - the 800 one
82:04 - it's pretty good is it 800 okay
82:09 - oh [ __ ] dude i'm gonna start
82:12 - coding every single day
82:16 - fighting as [ __ ] it is so
82:19 - fun bro wait it's not ah
82:23 - why does it look so dark here but like
82:25 - then when i actually pick it it's like
82:27 - not dark at all
82:31 - but that was the color somewhere like ah
82:34 - yeah that's good that's good
82:37 - probably you're going way too dark
82:40 - like this i think ah i think that's
82:42 - that's good yeah
82:43 - that's good right okay let's go yep
82:47 - like i like purple colors dude i really
82:50 - do like me too
82:53 - ah like a good purple
82:57 - better than ah [ __ ] okay
83:01 - or let's just try this dark one the one
83:04 - that we did get
83:07 - so let's drop it in
83:10 - let's grab the name of this and name it
83:13 - final two
83:15 - and name this final like this
83:18 - okay look at that look
83:21 - at that um how can i
83:25 - um can should we zoom
83:28 - out the image the background no no no no
83:31 - i i think i think um
83:36 - can we zoom it out a little bit center
83:40 - you want to go lex
83:44 - part about this boom
83:47 - [ __ ] that you can do flex dash start or
83:49 - something right
83:51 - oh okay
83:56 - react native
83:59 - flex start
84:03 - i want to zoom the image out you see
84:05 - what i'm saying so i can like
84:07 - see the [ __ ] hold on
84:10 - um hold on dude i'm gonna take that
84:14 - [ __ ]
84:15 - image let's do it like this okay so
84:19 - let's grab uh
84:20 - [Music]
84:23 - that's what i'm saying it looks way
84:25 - better like this
84:27 - yeah yeah i mean we just need like a
84:29 - good vertical images like that
84:31 - and then like [ __ ] let's go ahead
84:33 - beautiful
84:34 - so we got or should this be called the
84:37 - hero image right it's like really easy
84:39 - to understand
84:40 - i don't know the terminology what the
84:42 - [ __ ] is any hero image
84:43 - it's like the hero image you know like
84:46 - bam
84:47 - main one like the main [ __ ] oh okay
84:50 - okay dude this is so cool we learned how
84:52 - to make [ __ ] waves
84:53 - oh what the [ __ ] is sick um [ __ ]
84:56 - now we just need to go to noob app and
85:00 - like do a couple of things uh definitely
85:03 - need to wrap up our app in this provider
85:06 - that's for sure
85:12 - gosh this [ __ ] simulator is ass
85:16 - i hate the trade-offs it's like okay so
85:20 - you could do the whole regular reacting
85:22 - but that's just
85:23 - really really really hard really hard
85:27 - okay or you could go the expo round it's
85:31 - gonna be really easy
85:33 - but it's not gonna work yeah pretty much
85:36 - you're like um okay um this one's not
85:39 - gonna work because you're not gonna be
85:41 - able to figure it out it's because it's
85:42 - not gonna work because it's [ __ ] [ __ ]
85:45 - let's add another button underneath that
85:48 - so
85:48 - hold on let's do it like this okay so i
85:50 - know you gave this button some
85:52 - styling and stuff like that
85:56 - where did you color it okay so what i'm
85:58 - going to do is i'm going to
86:00 - remove some of the styling
86:04 - background color
86:07 - and default is blue you don't like it
86:12 - i do but on the dark blue background the
86:15 - light blue let's go
86:16 - success on it let's go status is equal
86:19 - to success
86:22 - because that's gonna work out oh vim
86:24 - mode in dark mode
86:25 - so i'm pretty [ __ ] good actually
86:28 - okay
86:31 - actually i'm see you two weeks from now
86:34 - we know you're doing this
86:36 - you're playing with a [ __ ] whim how
86:38 - do i install
86:39 - i can install packages and [ __ ] too in
86:41 - here
86:43 - i'm not sure i want to give our own [ __ ]
86:46 - one last try
86:47 - yeah like i'm gonna i'm gonna develop
86:50 - here in the future
86:52 - what happened no no it's just so
86:54 - discouraging that
86:55 - [ __ ] metro doesn't work sometimes so
86:58 - we have to like
86:59 - debug the [ __ ] out of everything yeah
87:02 - can you unselect everything
87:04 - oh yeah thank you yeah i actually
87:07 - just went to you this expo [ __ ] and
87:11 - i don't i don't [ __ ] find a way to
87:14 - install packages
87:15 - oh wait add dependency yeah so let's
87:18 - give it a try afterwards it's like if we
87:21 - keep [ __ ] get running into errors or
87:23 - some [ __ ] we'll give it a try
87:25 - let me try warning warning
87:28 - i feel like it might look pretty
87:30 - freaking cool
87:32 - because i love the orange color and it's
87:34 - like very clever programmy
87:37 - right yeah yeah yeah um
87:43 - i love it [ __ ] that's how this video
87:47 - should start
87:48 - okay so we've made pretty good progress
87:52 - i mean not having any skills in front
87:54 - end then
87:55 - not having react native skills and not
87:57 - knowing
87:58 - not ever doing any wave [ __ ] to
88:01 - putting together what we did i'm [ __ ]
88:03 - impressed
88:04 - um so now let's say
88:07 - so actually what we should say is
88:10 - start learning to code right
88:14 - and then we should have get started
88:16 - underneath there
88:18 - so let's actually see if we can write
88:22 - text here let's go text
88:25 - and let's go start what the [ __ ] does it
88:28 - say it's not there
88:30 - it's [ __ ] right like i don't even
88:32 - know how to [ __ ] inspect tools in the
88:34 - [ __ ]
88:37 - i don't think you can because
88:40 - i mean at the end of the day you're like
88:42 - looking at swift stuff
88:44 - all right so i see
88:47 - okay so i see this button looks juicy i
88:50 - can click it that's a good sign
88:53 - now how do i add the text underneath
88:56 - there
88:56 - to start learning the code because i'm
88:58 - not seeing the text
88:59 - it's because i mean i gave my text the
89:03 - same
89:04 - [ __ ] styling as a button so i should
89:06 - see the text right
89:08 - i guess yep so
89:12 - i'm trying to make it work and uh
89:16 - because it's position absolute and all
89:18 - of the good stuff
89:19 - you know let's go color and i'll go
89:23 - white
89:27 - [Music]
89:29 - i don't see [ __ ] dude why is this so
89:32 - [ __ ] hard to just do normal comments
89:35 - and stuff it's like
89:36 - add a text two hours later oh
89:39 - i know how to add text
89:45 - it's like [ __ ] that you and i would have
89:46 - like
89:48 - finished in react yes so long ago
89:51 - i know i would have finished it this
89:54 - whole [ __ ] episode
89:55 - bro um so
89:58 - where is the text why don't i see it
90:01 - uh what no [ __ ] idea
90:05 - i literally gave it the same styling as
90:07 - the button
90:08 - oh [ __ ] okay wait why'd you leave the
90:10 - session
90:12 - because you kicked me out i guess i
90:14 - didn't
90:15 - but i don't know i'm joining again so
90:18 - it's all good
90:19 - face id okay so this is looking really
90:23 - good
90:24 - we have our landing page
90:28 - looking really really beautiful um
90:31 - i wish i could add a little bit of text
90:35 - somewhere
90:36 - um i probably will at some point
90:40 - but i think this is pretty freaking good
90:42 - for now let me actually try adding text
90:45 - like that
90:46 - so there's text being added all the way
90:48 - to the top there
90:49 - which is interesting so
90:52 - let's look at the styling of this layout
90:55 - we got container
90:57 - direction is column okay
91:04 - [Music]
91:07 - i would like to add text here just
91:10 - looking good right
91:12 - yeah [ __ ] insane dude
91:15 - like look at this this looks cool right
91:20 - oh yeah what's crazy is that that's a
91:23 - button
91:27 - because i couldn't add a text there
91:32 - you know i don't know why i couldn't add
91:33 - a text there so i just made it a button
91:36 - and it's a button with a ghost outline
91:39 - hey don't [ __ ] around with my button
91:40 - what are you doing
91:44 - so i added a button with the ghost
91:47 - appearance
91:48 - and a basic status so that gives you a
91:51 - button like that
91:56 - okay okay yeah so
91:59 - how i started adding text i'm going to
92:01 - delete your text david
92:02 - is um i started adding text like this so
92:05 - you now see my
92:06 - wow is showing up on the background
92:10 - i see you put it in a safe area too it's
92:12 - good it's good
92:13 - i would like it to be kind of like
92:16 - uh where they have theirs so like if i
92:19 - go here
92:21 - [Music]
92:23 - you see they have theirs like underneath
92:27 - the photo
92:29 - says start learning to code so something
92:31 - like that would be cool but like
92:33 - we were having a lot of difficulty so
92:35 - what we had to do was
92:38 - kind of do weird [ __ ] like we use
92:40 - position absolute for these buttons
92:46 - um and yeah to add that text i mean i
92:49 - could do position absolute but that you
92:51 - know
92:52 - i don't know it feels like i'm doing
92:54 - something wrong
92:56 - all right so what i would probably do
92:59 - um in this situation right is like i
93:02 - would wrap
93:03 - all of this in a in a view right like
93:06 - the uh the buttons give me
93:08 - just one second before you go on uh
93:11 - yeah let me actually hide that wow text
93:14 - because
93:16 - i don't really need it right now so save
93:20 - save um
93:24 - add cp
93:27 - mobile app landing page
93:31 - get push wait there's nowhere to push
93:35 - all right
93:36 - um let's go let's see let's see
93:40 - and you have like image
93:43 - so i would have a uh
93:47 - so the whole app i think is in layout
93:51 - [Music]
93:53 - and then we have
93:58 - the wave container and i have no idea
94:01 - where the wave container is how big it
94:03 - is
94:03 - no idea i don't know how to do inspect
94:05 - element and react native
94:08 - yeah me either
94:11 - um
94:13 - [Music]
94:15 - i think if we have
94:19 - uh let's see like if we had a uh
94:22 - a view wrapped around your buttons and
94:26 - the line of text that you want to add
94:28 - and
94:29 - set the top margin to auto it'll it'll
94:32 - push everything down over the uh the
94:35 - wave
94:36 - uh and if we set the bottom margin it
94:39 - will
94:40 - so you're saying kind of like
94:43 - wrap all of this in a view
94:47 - but it already isn't a view
94:50 - right but inside of that uh oh is it
94:53 - already
94:54 - inside of that waves container okay so
94:57 - wave container
94:58 - has the image and the buttons and i
95:01 - think
95:02 - and then this is the image that it has
95:07 - so what happens when you put a
95:10 - text a text element in there i'll show
95:13 - you what happens
95:14 - there's a text element and it doesn't
95:17 - exist anywhere
95:23 - let's go what does uh styles dot
95:28 - can i have a link to get into the code
95:33 - sent it in our chat okay cool
95:36 - dude react native is so much more
95:38 - annoying than [ __ ]
95:40 - straight up react yeah but it can do it
95:42 - can do a lot of things though like
95:44 - being able to do like desktop without
95:46 - being such a memory sync like uh
95:48 - like a uh electron i see
95:52 - it's like some [ __ ] time to get
95:55 - to get used to like for real clever
95:58 - programmers we'll go new
96:00 - go cp react native
96:04 - app creating the repository
96:10 - we'll add a team to it invite teams the
96:13 - squad
96:14 - yeah um write code
96:17 - and uh all right so none of us can
96:20 - figure out how to add a text right
96:23 - i'm trying it out right now
96:26 - all right lamb whatever idea you got
96:29 - just go for it ask for forgiveness you
96:32 - know not permission
96:33 - the way you see anything render and
96:35 - react native is you have to save like 20
96:37 - times
96:38 - and refresh does the different firebase
96:42 - [ __ ] my life dude i want to just develop
96:46 - and react js bro why
96:47 - why can't we just do that why do we have
96:49 - to [ __ ]
96:50 - no metro's not gonna let me in
96:55 - oh wait hold on you can see it here just
96:57 - hit save and you'll
96:58 - see it on my ecam that's so weird where
97:01 - is the
97:02 - text hmm
97:06 - okay z index let's see the index one
97:10 - i'm going to say text
97:14 - style see if area view
97:17 - it's inside the v-waves
97:23 - let's see yeah i don't see anything
97:26 - what the heck but if i take it out of
97:28 - here
97:29 - all right so as soon as you bring it
97:31 - [Music]
97:32 - into
97:34 - waves all right
97:37 - that's like though bro let's just sit
97:38 - there let me shave
97:40 - oh shouldn't the safe area view like
97:43 - wrap around everything though
97:46 - well normally the safer review is to
97:49 - keep it in like the oh yeah yeah like
97:51 - the safe review
97:52 - apart from the images i think so it's
97:54 - done like everything is in the safe area
97:57 - okay so it works there but then when we
98:00 - put it
98:01 - beneath waves let me
98:04 - save a couple more times just to you
98:06 - know make sure it actually
98:08 - yeah then just appears all right so
98:11 - let's take a look at those
98:12 - i'll be right back waves i wonder
98:16 - if it is because all right
98:20 - um
98:23 - all right guys so i hope you enjoyed
98:25 - that us building
98:26 - out the landing page of clever
98:29 - programmer we
98:30 - i think are gonna one day publish this
98:32 - but it also gives me an incentive and a
98:34 - reason to code this thing
98:36 - up so i hope you had fun i had a ton of
98:39 - fun building this
98:40 - oh and if you enjoyed this smash the
98:42 - like button
98:43 - okay subscribe to the channel because
98:45 - this is the channel where you learn
98:46 - all things react react native and full
98:49 - stack development so thanks so much
98:51 - and i'll see you in the next video
99:53 - you

Cleaned transcript:

um [ __ ] that's how this video should start yo guys what is up i wanted to learn react native so i thought what better way than to get two other badass developers with me from team cp and we just do it together so one of our hosts today is lam what's up lam what's up yo and then we got david in the house what's up guys this is gonna be a ton of fun and we're just gonna build [ __ ] on the fly we don't even know how it's gonna go i don't see [ __ ] dude why is this so [ __ ] hard to just do normal comments and stuff it's like add a text two hours later oh i know how to add text but we're gonna figure it out together my goal is to master react native and hopefully together we build something from scratch i think lem you already have some experience with react native right yeah i've got some experience i got some experience okay dope he's uh he always acts really humble but he's a badass so we're excited to see what we do okay cool so with that said um let's just go all right that was a good intro we did a good job guys okay so i'm gonna whip up a new react project right lem yep uh if i do something i probably can do um an expo project yes i will do expo what is it expo init the name of the project yeah i think so all right so that's it right do you know any of this david not really this is all new i mean i write it like once you excited to get your ass kicked david yeah yes that's how we learn and now let's open this bad boy up github practice react native learn react native open that [ __ ] app.js you aren't start can i do that can i do that yeah i'm gonna do ios simulator let's see you have like xcode and everything on there right yes i have xcode installed yeah because that install takes forever yeah what is happening oh it's working code okay that's a good sign yo guys i'm actually so excited like it takes so long though yeah initial render is uh is pretty painful because it has to you know convert everything but after that speeds up a little bit i don't know where your emulator is though it says running application on iphone 12 pro mac is it on a different desktop let's check so now if we change this to let's change this text to you guys see the new update that i made to the app oh that's so cool yep let's go okay so i guess the first thing i'm going to do is just want to make it like dark mode enabled from the start so can i just change this color to freaking background color zero zero zero and like just type in color here and go uh white like that but why did the font color not change yeah it should be it should be color white i wonder if it is because we need to uh target the actual text um text element yeah that could be it like within the container the actual text element change text color and react what i find you have to give the text a style i think and then you could probably do it like oh wait wait wait i got you i got you i think we can do this look i think we can pass text the style right here and we can just go styles um styles like that and then i think you can do then we can go color white this maybe let's go to our app oh [ __ ] that worked because look at here essentially you can pass it a style whatever object kind of like this guy's doing like this you can pass that style just like that you know but i'm just actually giving it an object like you can literally take this thing here pop that in right there like that yeah but that's not in inline style that's not good yeah yeah yeah boom okay yes out of the box we have dark mode ready let's go whoa who the [ __ ] did that me cause i'm wait so you have to like add quotes in there i'm just testing it here okay try oh that worked okay go 800. so how do we do an h2 is there such a thing as h2 lim uh no no it's just the uh just the text then you have to adjust from there you have to actually bring it up to like and when you do sizes it's like the if there's no pixel amounts it's just like a number uh and you'd have to size it manually oh the browser app okay so can we do font size is that yeah it's a thing yeah so can i give it ems or what what do i give it i mean no i can't i don't i don't think you can actually give it ems you have to actually give it like a number amount hey hey hey all right we just need to make our own whoa that looks cool so far more like an appleish thing all right that actually looks clean a react native framework is stunning okay get started but um so far so good let's let's see their github because that's what's gonna tell me if i should use them or not 8.1 k bro that's [ __ ] great and okay i kind of like the like the rounded corners and the playfulness of their design like that's the one thing i don't like about material ui like material ui looks like you develop for an android like it literally looks like you're an android developer and i [ __ ] hate that but like this looks very uh like kind of like delicious like you want to eat it's like i don't know it's nice clearly i'm a designer with my design design terminology you just have to say you know it uh it we we're making it pop and then you're a designer yeah making it pop yeah like look this makes it pop and it looks like um looks like 3d and cartoony and fun and inviting and playful i love the feel of that when i look at [ __ ] material ui it feels like you're going to text me and it's going to be a green blob of [ __ ] text and i'm just going to block you [ __ ] you yeah install into an existing app i mean we do have an existing app i'll tell you that we've done a lot of work on it so far beautiful using yarn yarn ad expo ah if you use expo you should install you should expo install like this oh nice but wouldn't whenever i do yarn add doesn't it already automatically change it to xbow install because that's what i thought i don't know i just like even when i install because even when i do um yarn start it actually does expo start under under the hood oh yeah like i think in your uh your package.json it probably just says expo okay so let's install it on our expo hopefully our entire app will change and look beautiful right away boom [Laughter] what it didn't do everything damn ooh okay so i like when they give me code because that means i don't have to write it wrap the root component of your app into application provider so let's go to our app and let's just paste copy pasta that oh my god what could have possibly gone wrong [Laughter] let's see wait hold on you deleted the whole styling but what's the error saying it says could not be found but like i did install the did you uh did you uh import the layout wait hold on hold on hold on it says if you use expo use expo install react native svg but like look it never said ui kitten so or any of this that's confusing right yeah okay i'm just gonna type that do you see eva or kitten anywhere i don't see any of that i just see like regular looking stuff so i'm just going to do yarn add and let's see what happens that's kind of confusing directions on their end i think it was put on theme eva dark oh is it that easy oh dude that is so [ __ ] cool oh that makes me so happy i did nothing and everything worked that's what i like wow okay i i'm gonna be honest i even love the dark mode like i love the color they have in the background too i'm a huge fan not gonna lie i'm a huge fan of uh ui kitten already we strongly recommend paying enough attention on this guide in order to have develop a better developer experience important for me though okay so it's kind of like bootstrappy here we got the buttons so like let's put a button and let's give it like a success or primary and let's see what that looks like so who's going to put the button you guys want to do the honors of putting a button right underneath home yeah good one gonna be lamb because it didn't compile on my end should we how about how about this let's make like a clever programmer app so then one day we can put it in our app store and students can go and watch clever programmer videos or courses or whatever what do you guys think about that [ __ ] yes yeah okay [ __ ] it let's do it so i'm gonna change it from home to clever programmer because that i know how to do so i'm proud of that so you don't have to do that weird thing where you could title you can actually go old school and then we can write inside of it start learning and we'll just write two t's nice beautiful anybody want to add just a little margin between clever programmer and start learning we should try yeah yeah all right and um yeah let me let me try it okay oh and that's also cool we can have how many times a button was pressed and what i want to do is i want to have a counter and we'll do set counter and i'll do use state of zero nice so where did you add the margin bottom to the text um oh now i had to just set counter thing that's weird why did that not work perfect so you're incrementing the counter by one beautiful yep and where are we having the problem now i think it's in the stylesheet.create but i don't see the problem why is that a problem is mice are we not closing things properly is that what's happening that's exactly how it started starting spelling there's misspelling create okay now it should be oh wait can't find variable style sheet that's the [ __ ] problem do we have to import styles oh yeah yeah oh i have to import it from react native wait is it is it from react native or i think it's can we not get it from the kitten thing so let's look for style sheet here style no you can hold on guys so import oh yeah you okay so you import style sheet from react native you guys are right okay so style sheet just comes from react native so go ahead and import that there we go let's go nice all right so the 16. so i'm going to add another text right underneath here and we'll do text all right and then i'm just going to say um you clicked the button we'll go counter times nice is it actually working it looks like a potato the quality no it's working so yoho style dot um i'm gonna call this uh i'm gonna refactor this and we're gonna call rename symbol and call it a header text like this oh and then okay i'll do style equals styles dot paragraph text i mean i don't know if that's too verbose or not nice you're already on it paragraph text dude this is sick yeah rec native is fun this is [ __ ] good you added the margin to it that's interesting why is it not maybe just take some time huh maybe we just have to like i mean you added a huge margin bottom to paragraph text exactly style so let's see the documentation eh oh category h1 what the what is that oh that oh when you do that it all it actually uses the h1 builtin styling oh shh yeah wait so if i do over here paragraph text category uh equals p nothing change because i i guess that's the default how about h h4 it says unsupported configuration real quick text yeah margin bottom should be like hey look so it just took time to refresh but h4 worked i think i just don't know why i'm not getting um i don't know what's happening with the margin though yeah because you because you added margin bottom yeah like big time why don't we just um why don't we just go to here let's do this let's take this out and we'll do styles no let's not do that yeah styles.container and then let's create container and and hold on hold on i got you i got you don't don't make the dictionary because i got or that object just one second hold on okay um dictionary python guy here [ __ ] you guys i mean we weren't the ones that didn't choose the right language to start with oh wait comma was in the wrong why does it like putting it in just one line where and nobody can see what it is but okay that's fine um now to this what we want to add is uh margin bottom right oh no that's not that's not going to do what we wanted to do i basically want every text element inside of this layout to have a margin bottom is there an easy way to do that uh yeah so what you can do is um i believe you can do embedded styles so like if you can just do that how do we do that if you can just show us i want to see how yeah if i remember correctly which one is it that we we're trying to fix we just want every element inside of this container to have a certain margin bottom like we also don't understand why like why is this margin bottom not working here for paragraph text let's start there i'll say um i mean the official documentation says margin bottle margin bottom works like margin dash bottom in css that's it should so basically every component has its own styling yeah it's looking that way well can you figure out why how can we add margin bottom to that paragraph text the button and the text is too close so why is that yeah yeah let's see pull up window david all right maybe put a margin top on the button okay that makes sense dang that margin top is not working for the oh wait some margin takes a while no it's not that it just takes a while the paragraph text margin bottom is like not working at all but the margin top is working because if i if i had 32 on the bottom uh button you have to save it like multiple times but like this line here is just like not doing anything i don't think yeah how about giving it like an 800 just to like throw it off yeah that threw it off okay so it kind of works so if margin bottom just mysteriously doesn't work then just try to aim for margin top i guess wait wait wait let's let's try that because can you you save it too all right let's just move on so we figured this out we don't need to now obsess over it so we got this i think we don't need the paragraph text all right so that's good now what else should we add guys um i would say let's go with user authentication because we need that definitely or we can just put the uh i think we're gonna need yeah let's do more front end stuff for now like i would like to add like cards where people could see the courses or something at the top you know like a javascript course um pwj like i don't know like a javascript course a pwg course something like that you know and then a bottom where we have like maybe home and then we got something else that would be really good yeah let's look at the um ui and see if they have a bottom uh bottom at bar kind of thing there you go i think bottom tabs might be what we're looking for perfect i'm gonna follow you then all right and look at their code let's see they got a really simple uses example here down at the uh at the bottom of the uh bottom of the help it looks like we only need like two components let's see which one are you looking at the uh so on the uh the tabs uh bottom tabs help it's the very last entry oh that uh the users with the star right yeah yeah just with the start just to uh just to get that one you know that one uh example going wait so we need the star icon so that's that's the thing where it complaining about did you import it oh wait uh yeah wait would it be working if i did it like there you go but it's not showing or what if well it's not showing because you're oh you added it in my bed yeah all right i just added it in yeah yeah can you make the name of it a little bit more complicated that's how it was in documentation [Laughter] let's see i can't remember what the error says kazia made it a little more complicated just worry piece of [ __ ] [Laughter] let's see but hold on what is the [ __ ] error saying like i don't know i don't see it that's what i was saying you didn't [ __ ] import it that's what i was like dude did you import it you're like yeah i was like okay but then i went because i imported it okay where because i don't see any import it's right there bottom level this is what it is icon eva icons pack i mean i could still be wrong but let's see am i still wrong holy [ __ ] yes you are uh yeah yeah you're a kid in components yeah we need icon registry apparently all the odds and ends we need wait i have no idea what's happening here icons pack name so it's not registered with the registry service show me what you're using as example code sure so can you guys link it in slack whatever the stuff you're looking at because i think the problem that's happening is um it's not registered with the icon registry service or whatever that supposed to mean because that's what the first stack error says says unidentified object ufo alright so you guys uh did this right navigation container and create bottom tab navigator um i was looking at the one to the uh the example at the very bottom the super simple one with one uh oh my god that is so beautiful [ __ ] what it's [ __ ] good what example this one the super simple one this one nope yeah it's like yep right up right at the bottom no it's not even more simple very bottom one that one oh okay so you guys did that and then you're i was looking at it i haven't i haven't uh i haven't tried yet okay let me know i don't know which one uh you're using david so david got so did you do bottom navigation tab yeah you did okay we don't need this for now so i'm gonna remove that too so we got icon bottom navigation tab it's being imported from ui kitted components um and then icon like that so where's your icon show me your icon yeah it's under export default which might be [ __ ] things up i'm just gonna like uh put it over here that's probably not the problem wait we're getting a better problem now star icon you're passing it in something with props name star okay and then your bottom sheet icon you're giving it this yeah autumn sheet giving it a star icon okay um i think you might need to put these in the right order let's like put it put it in the right order you know like let's build it first and then our app is gonna get access to it um so you mean like on the top whoa what is happening here okay can't find variable so star icon you're clearly describing what a star icon is um is it returning an expression you might not be returning anything here you might have to put it in parentheses so you can retrieve no you don't have to because when you're working with arrow functions it works immediately like it's it's just gonna uh return one thing without the parents but if you put the parents you can like put more stuff in there okay evaluating icons evaluating icons pack dot name i love github issues and it's closed so that's a good sign i guess you forgot to register an icon package and sometimes it's just like the owners like [ __ ] it so we never installed eva icons i don't think guys or no did we uh i don't think so you sure i thought this was the first thing we did no okay let's go here well it wasn't that big list of uh if it was a big list of yarn stuff yeah we did not do eva icons actually that's why we don't have them so let's do eva icons and then i don't think we need to do react natives svg because we've already installed that so let's install this and that should work because really it's the problem but it's not recognizing the icon so we should i think it should work now let's hit save weird do i have to do it the way they did it like darn add and then like plus react native svg like that i don't think that should make any difference right um register icons that is what we need to do because even if you look at the error the first error starts with some registry [ __ ] so oh [ __ ] i was on the right track son suckas i was on the frickin right track way before you fools okay we're gonna also need icon registry i like how in their example like they don't freaking show this yeah so in the default um you need to actually register the icons so like right here you actually need to register all your icons like that why am i getting a big fat red error oh okay just wrap it in jsx element i guess um like this okay [ __ ] my life are we so we are getting icon registry that's good i am getting that i've installed it too we are doing this here as well um registry eva icons pack so that's the icons pack we're using within our app oh wait am i ending the freaking thing yeah i am what's the error i don't understand yeah let's go [ __ ] see how easy that was guys [Laughter] yeah oh these are nice father father icon okay let's see what type of cards they got i mean we could also add a chessboard i'm sure our students would have the need for that yeah like how is like code academy app laid out let me actually go see codecademy or something or like um what are those like popular code apps like uh solo learn so learn um i know like uh codementor io i don't know i think like i see uh uh play just learn like in i might bring it just like freaking scream oh i love scrimba okay this is a cool landing page so take a look at this guys i'm gonna drop it in our chat in slack um what are our names [Laughter] so this is uh memo which is like one of the most popular coding applications this is their landing page um the email should come to us in about i mean it's just a photo there we go okay so let me go downloads image so this is what it is so this is something like how our hours should look like okay yeah so we can have our landing page like this that would be cool okay i actually know a side which generates an svg with that wavy thing oh perfect nice wavy svg generator let's try it wavy svg get waves.i o i think that's exactly it let me let me see it i have it bookmarked but how do i apply this image here that's that's that's that it's down there it's down there like you can download it uh there is a download button somewhere and you just like you will get the the yeah that exact svg vegeta you see that blue thing no i mean the blue thing is cool but like how do i how do i put an image into it that's what i'm saying oh that's not happening there so this is not what i want this is just the wave i want one where you give it an image i want one where you give it an image and then it gives you i mean it's cool to have a wave don't get me wrong that's [ __ ] so but i want to have a landing page like theirs i mean we can just sketch it together is there an image generator no no i mean i mean like you download the svg you like you have an image and then just put the two oh how about this i got an idea let's use how do can i flip this upside down oh perfect yep um nah that's gonna look weird i'm trying to think how we can make it work um let's see her photo again let's go to downloads so like how do we get this thing like i'm sure there's some way right lem holy [ __ ] is 11 shock or what can you guys hear me here we are i've been on mute this whole time how do we do this uh i'm thinking that we're going to have to we're going to have to build an svg i can do that and uh real quick okay yeah do you wanna okay that's dope let's do that all right let's see grab my pen tool is my internet so back let's see that's got kind of a subtle wave to it bring an iphone frame i mean there's gotta be a website that does this to be honest i just can't freaking um let's see svg generator like their second page is really freaking dope as well actually i'll air drop it to myself i mean it's pretty much the same it's just a different photo they're using which looks pretty freaking cool this is the one oh sh i really like this like the photo they're using and everything's like super sick let's see so i think i think if we use this wave generator we can like um we can put the svg that generates uh like one like that on top and then like make the make a div under it the same color um can't in photoshop you just create a shape like yeah with the with pen tool right so you should be able to create a shape like this and then just pop an image in there right i mean i don't know how to exactly do that in photoshop but i know that should be possible yeah i'm actually um i'm in figment now i'm gonna load uh an iphone frame just so i can get a good reference uhhuh do you want me to send this over to you in slack i'll drop this in slack as well okay um interesante i like the font to create a profile to save your progress and then this one is start learning to code so let's actually david let's build this while he builds an image okay let's like okay this right here with the [ __ ] like the whole thing let's just model this exact thing okay and you got the image right uh yeah yeah can you unfuck up whatever you [ __ ] up bro please uh uh collaborative programming words [Laughter] yo david so first of all this is a bottom navigation tab right but it's like smack in the middle of the screen so how do we fix that what do you mean it's smacking oh you mean like you want to put it like down there or some [ __ ] yeah i want to put it down there that's exactly what i want to do let me give it a style because what the [ __ ] because what else is the point of bottom navigation tab if it's not going to put [ __ ] at the bottom you know what i mean like oh because because we're centering our [ __ ] right like we're centering our entire freaking so let's not do that let's remove a line items you probably do uh if the containers if it's parents containers flex one you can do uh margin top as auto how about we use display grid instead of [ __ ] flex cause uh it's just better hold on hold on hold on hold on let's before we bring out our bazooka let's just use our brains a little bit [Laughter] this guy's always ready to throw in the [ __ ] kitchen sink at every problem so margin auto so okay so i mean it won't stop refreshing what the [ __ ] is happening oh because david will not stop writing code i see you know what i'm just gonna like put my hands up no no no no you're doing good i'm just seeing don't touch the keyboard okay okay you're fine david you're fine i just wanted to see what it might be so okay so margin top auto worked but it moved everything no position absolutes okay fine why because is that isn't that like doesn't that lead to a [ __ ] ton of problems oh bottom nav okay okay okay okay okay okay i see what you're doing okay i can [ __ ] with that that's cool that's cool i'm gonna then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make a position of this relative okay i mean i think that that should be the initial state though but but yeah yeah i don't think so that's what pro uh css developers tell me it's a happening make the parent relative and make the child absolute okay um is it not working i mean in real life most of the times the parent is a relative of the sun so um so david what did you do did you get that joke pills today but by the way i i might have but i don't what pills did you [ __ ] get that [ __ ] up the whole app every time code [ __ ] you know what i'm just gonna [ __ ] this like not do it what invalid position of value ab but you never wrote ab you wrote absolute i'm not understanding i think it's my abs that it's probably uh hold on do you guys see the error because i don't understand it i just removed all the styling on that did my server just die could have i just killed it from here i'm just gonna yarn start remote colleague kills american company servers but you did that i didn't you developers smashes the whole company oh man um okay so all right wait i can just stick this right in the freaking folder hold on a sec about to put my graphic into the assets how about we put all the content in first and then worry about oh [ __ ] he's about to drop it in assets that's [ __ ] sick um guys why is this like should i close this [ __ ] simulator or what the [ __ ] is happening opening oh it's still opening huh interesting opening okay it's taking its sweet time oh i know the svg is going to work i'll make a ping too all right so is there a reason why this is taking so [ __ ] long that's weird right like there's some weird [ __ ] with like whenever you're doing react native development like normal common sense stuff like doesn't work probably because we don't do that too much and it's just a lack of experience but module parse failed what is that we you may need an appropriate loader to handle this file currently no loaders are configured to process this file uh okay well everything was working so what changed what did we add that had that impact because we were good here oh [ __ ] son i don't know if you're going to be able to use the svg so uh i'm i'm also going to stick a a png in that folder okay oh so what you're doing is what you want to do is put a regular image and then put the svg on top of that with like a higher z index or something is that what you're trying well so well what i actually just made a uh g that would uh that would cover the bottom like uh portion of the page and yeah we can put like a we can put that to like a z index of like negative one something like that and then uh have it under everything okay oh yeah i want to give my folder open here bottom dot png i mean david don't don't be sad we'll add in the authentication as soon as the first landing page is built thank you i'm so happy now like i can't even tell how happy this is man at least that [ __ ] will break um okay so does it seem so my app is just gone like just straight up just [ __ ] gone like is it there for you guys i'm just getting errors on like fail to compile let me try uh you may need an appropriate loader so i'm gonna google that let's see stack overflow 126 upvotes npm install babel preset yes 2015. wait hold on this is uh let me let the world know that we're working with react native here in all caps i've been banging my head against the wall all day trying to figure out is this guy okay hope he's not dead um it still says react and not react native even though i wrote react native in all caps would we still have to do this babble crap i haven't before i guess you'll resolve more incorrectly closing the upper property try this loaders presets react es 215 um okay i'll see so why do we need that because everything was working up until now so i'm not going to do that solution because it just sounds silly to me like did somebody in here go and change app.json or our babble config babel preset expo so that looks like normal to me and then where's our loader hello loader where the hell is our loader let's see you know what's what's the uh the error rate again um the error is saying module parse failed you may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type currently no loaders are configured to process this file but we have the loader that we don't need image or or an icon or anything i mean we do have an icon but that icon we had the whole time everything was working um fine but then i think david did something and and it changed so do you remember your last couple of changes david the thing the the style for that uh that stuff right there okay so so let's try that real quick because that's when things were working let me go back to our app nope still still [ __ ] up um should i just remove that right there the problem is happening inside of input.component.js on line 105. are we using any inputs i don't think so not at all do you even have input imported in nope react react native native expo loader why did we change bro what the [ __ ] um i'm just gonna start it again it's like if it won't run we can't really make any progress you know like we literally need to be able to at least see it right try compiling now i got rid of the uh um the svg that was in the assets oh it might be the [ __ ] svg you're right that was the new change that we added let me actually look react native assets svg how to use svgs with react native yeah you have to actually have a bring in a loader so that might be it i do have react native svg by the way we have installed that already okay um but like where to add svgs is the question um ah see look we need a transformer that does this [ __ ] this is what we need to do you see all this we need a metroconfig.js and babel needs to know how to transform the path for the svgs that's why we were having the problem and then in your assets you could add svgs i think our app is going to compile now with the svg not there like so far i don't see any problems and like yeah i don't get any errors at all let's hit w open in the web browser project is running at 1906. let's hit enter wait why do i still have that problem you took it out right yeah uh let's try it on the land wait a minute is there like do we have to clean up cash there is a way it might be worth it look the app is loading it's bundling boom the app is there [ __ ] yeah so it was that 3g good [ __ ] debugging um i think we're going to have to use this transformer um this looks way too complicated yeah right like shouldn't that be the why don't i just go with a [ __ ] png well like with rack native anyways like all of your images are loaded to uh um in s3 instance a what instance um uh amazon storage oh really yeah let's look at react native transformer and if this has a [ __ ] ton of github stars then that means we should use it if it doesn't then it's probably a scam um okay so i believe we'd be able to make svg's work my friend but we would have to go this route do you guys want to go this route uh not really all right i mean if there's any easier way so what's the solution the solution is to go png yeah i think the solution is to go png okay so for example david take note of one hour and 36 minutes when we decided to scratch svgs and go png's that might be a good note to add and then you can actually drop that in the video as well okay uhhuh okay so quick quick quick quick quick all right i want to see what interesting so we got cards card statuses nice not exactly what i was imagining when i was thinking cards but okay um can you help okay so cool so let's um let's make damage work now right lamb okay so let's add the image to the home page um app app actually let's look at dribble for inspiration i totally forgot we can do that [ __ ] yeah because dribble is just the [ __ ] best oh yeah inspiration explore design work um mobile right there where that's what i was looking for mobile ah okay cool that's beautiful the grocery one oh the dashboard looks so [ __ ] good yo that's actually the type of dashboard we want built for our [ __ ] too loaned processed and approved take note of that i can put that together okay let's work on that [ __ ] that's what i'm saying now we got david in before david was just [ __ ] sleeping in his head david go get a coffee okay or you're fired okay david it's like everything is like that david go get sleep or you're fired he's like oh [ __ ] okay this is for job okay it's for work great i can sleep in peace now okay i'm not gonna lie guys i'm starting to get excited as [ __ ] looking at these designs i'm actually so [ __ ] happy right on so cool i really like the uh ones with like uh that uh uh the one with the illustrations on it that one's really cool like that's super friendly um what are you talking about everything has illustrations your your mouse is like pretty much on it right now okay this one yeah there's a blue one right there oh no i like the uh oh [ __ ] i like the shapes and stuff i do wait wait i have i have a resource for that too wait so it's like if they want to go through the builds or if they want to go through like certain things that could be cool um do you guys not want it to be dark themed you guys want the app to be like i don't know all the way dark i love dark theme you know yeah dark dark dark theme all the way but yeah dude this is exciting because if i learn how to build designs like this like my life will change forever because these are the designs i want to like i mean i can point to the stuff that excites me um oh [ __ ] that's kind of cool why the [ __ ] oh pun intended i should have you um make like a uh a pinterest board or something of like uh designs that really uh uh that really captivate you and uh i could i could work something up dude that is sick like there's a bunch of [ __ ] that like gets me really [ __ ] excited that's [ __ ] cool i mean i know it's not like coding related but like jeez that's cool it's like imagine giving people like coding exercises like hey you got five minutes go it's like a simple exercise like loop through an array um whenever you're working on these kind of stuff let me know me too seriously like this this type of design if i can do this that is exciting as [ __ ] because then i mean then it's [ __ ] game over oh yeah exactly wow you are right lam i will say that this is probably like the i just sent in a link to the chat with the with a bunch of stuff like this so let me just go here oh i have quasi design inspiration so i'll just keep putting this in here done um i'm like i really want to go for a dark theme but i don't know why none of these are dark themes um isn't there a filter yeah filter color filter ah you're right filter wait tags dark uh dark ah that's what's up nice that's a nice landing page which is invisible for some reason okay i could [ __ ] with something like this too this is not bad this is kind of cool but you know still not completely what i'm after but that's pretty cool um the day streaks are pretty cool like i would like to have for students to kind of like what streak they're on i'll build something up hey this is so inspiring that it literally makes me want to like go crazy building an app you know oh you get excited when you look at this this is cool i think you should be able to like click on a card and then it shows you what's what the course contains or what the video contains or whatever and then you can hit play then we should uh level up our oh my goodness this is cool like each core should be like this that's really cool yeah that's really cool so like you look up a course and you're like oh javascript course or like you know whatever react beginner course and then it has all the videos in there that'd be really dope um but we should get some landing page inspirations like i kind of want to look at some landing pages and then wow that's so beautiful i like want all these apps to be in the app store where i can just go and download them oh [ __ ] like dashboards like these i would want to have you know like like dashboards like these lamp 100 that is [ __ ] cool so like i just dropped a little sample of something that i have uh i designed recently where in the chat oh it just came through oh [ __ ] son damn that's [ __ ] clean that's [ __ ] dope bro yeah i like how on the left hand side of slash archive slash char underscore pages mac and a key where is like landing page like i want to see like here let's get out of here let's go i don't know we're in mobile so you want to go up to inspiration and go there so landing no but i want i want mobile landing pages oh okay or like let's just look at login pages dark login but what do we call it register pages is that what they call it like not the login page i want the registration page like where you register you know where you click get started and [ __ ] that i want yeah there's like three of them okay lem how far are we into the the svg thing are we good to go on that because i think we can just code up the design of memo that we saw for now oh yeah um i can put the i can put the spg back um there is a uh like the wavy bottom there's a png of it right now that we can work with um okay i am actually i'm actually gonna have to uh have to jump here in like a little bit i got a uh i got a student call i gotta take care of okay oh man but it's been so much fun [Laughter] oh yeah so do we have that image with this like little wave or like we don't right now yeah well the there's the png of it in the uh uh but this is but this is just a wavy bottom right this is not an image with the waves hold on i'm all right i'm i'm sorry i'm i'm a little confused i think i misunderstood i mean is there an image um but how did these guys do this is this not oh they don't have an image here right like it's not like that this is just an image and then in photoshop that put these waves is that not what they did no i think what they did is that um they have the image as like um as like z index like zero or something like that right and then they added the waves over it yeah okay so david we can work on this right yep okay let's work on this then and we can add oh yeah we obviously can add like regular images um in react okay if you gotta go all good all good brother all good all right hey this has been this has been excellent i had a i had a blast awesome bro enjoy all right take care boys take care man bye take care all right i'm gonna go with touchable opacity what's up david what's up we're the last one standing let's go all right let's go image there's an easier way how about that so bomb hey nice my boy fast i think we can just import it from somewhere where is the image um let's use um so next time we ran into a problem like that where we know we're not wrong let's clean our cache the cache yeah so okay we're good let's now bring this image back and hopefully it messes everything up again oh [ __ ] yo this is a this is mobile development for you just adding an image just [ __ ] takes like our lives experience and swift it was so much easier nah react native is way easier i think so i think wait hold on so now let's what's uh let's now we're making progress dude i'm excited so yeah yep let's fix this image and bro i think lem like scammed us bro like how do we add the [ __ ] waves no let's just turn that [ __ ] into a png put it right under and then just like have like a negative margin between the two with the top image beings your way hold on i'm not on the same page as you one second so let's go to is this what you're saying go to get waves yeah yeah all right i think this is the easiest one yeah yeah okay just somehow download this now i'm excited bro okay so we'll just down i'll just download the first first actually rhymes with cam so all right so svg copied up um so we'll make a new file and it will be oh no we cannot do svgs remember is it we cannot do switches he gave us some cash too no no no we can't do svgs where's lim yo give me the file give us the png file he put it in the freaking thing and then i removed it but he gave us the png file how about i go into [ __ ] uh uh he's gonna give it to us okay oh [ __ ] my leg is asleep [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] one that gives you png i have the png oh download png that's exactly what i was looking for perfect bump oh okay you can you can work that way too yeah yeah wait who dropped the wavy bottom oh not me not me i moved in here's lambs i don't um so i'm adding lambs as well showing finder wavy bottom png okay so how do we how do we use that image i would put it right under uh like here okay here let me upload that image to freaking imgur and use it from there because what is this anchor it's just hosting images yeah but is it like whatever you upload it's gonna be public right i mean yeah i don't know what kind of private images you're [ __ ] adding all right so let's copy this paste it paste this image um let's give it a height that's like way smaller 200 there we go perfect magnificent oh you should have unticked the background from that haiku or high k up thing i can go upside down on this i don't know on the right like on the right side yeah like i could go upside down and but how do i get um like uh like uh for example i don't want any of uh that i just want the blue uh see see the on the right hand side color uh two lines below yeah and on the right side next to the top one oh two two three three there is the eye thing and just uncheck the eye perfect because now i can position absolute this to be just right below oh wait no no i can i can position absolute this and i can override it onto the image right uh yeah exactly exactly yeah but like you can also do and i think that's that's better if uh if we do margin negative that's a dope app by the way it's called uh opted high gay yeah uh where the [ __ ] did it go right there like it even gives blurry gradient and all that [ __ ] that we need for exactly i just discovered it today i mean right now right after i discovered it or not no no i i was messing with it earlier um yeah where is it a project all right so i will add it like that wait it was supposed to be a [ __ ] png but it's doing some weird ass [ __ ] now i'm gonna call it uh upside down upd and instead i will do require and hopefully it's gonna [ __ ] everything up forever yay it did i don't know dot slash dot slash like that speed yes okay now what i need to do is give it us uh let's go and drop in touchable opacity like this let's what's that let's wrap this image in touchable opacity what's the touchable opacity um i'll show you and now we can actually give it styling as well so let's give it styling and we'll do styles dot um waves or something that makes sense yeah okay and then let's go here and let's go waves and position absolute and let's go margin top you need to give it an uh position to be actually absolute oh [ __ ] disconnected what disconnected skype wait why did the app disconnect hello why did the app disconnect what the [ __ ] that's weird it looks stupid on the simulator but on my phone it's actually not looking too bad that's half there okay um margin top 200 margin top 200 again 2 000 that's nothing [ __ ] um i just want to like put it here you know isn't that what we're supposed to do or what yeah uh i mean like i'm supposed to like i'm i'm trying to add it to the top of that but that's not going to do anything right that's not going to do what we want it to do is it because if i my gut feeling says okay can we wrap the two images together and then just put the second one on the bottom like the waves in the bottom the waves at the bottom hold on um okay if you want to try that as long as just i think we don't [ __ ] up any cash related thing what do you mean wrap the two images what do you mean by that i'm in like the um i don't think they're like divs i mean you could put it in like a view you could put it in a view yeah but like they already are interviews i don't understand like what's the point of that so i mean wait uh okay go for it girlfriend i'm in view like this boom and then put this here and yeah it's acting up let's go and instead of like this i would do images wait misspelled style oh hold on the problem is i can't find view read the error dude doesn't mean oh we gotta import it is it not important no i don't think so that's important what okay this is this boom there bam okay and now i would do like this here something like this uh why doesn't it center this image can you show the app can see it ice cream okay let's learn from this because these guys got well but that's not what we want right we want um how like what are these hold on i'm not conceptually [ __ ] understanding something like i think that's more important to understand so these waves here are just white waves right or what what the [ __ ] is this yeah that's a white wave that goes from the very bottom all the way to almost the middle where it covers the image which probably would take up the whole screen anyway okay so we are so the image really needs to be a background image then right actually that makes sense so let's go ahead and make our first of all let's go and make our image background image first so let's go react native background image let's start off there let's just keep [ __ ] simple and go from there so yeah i've used this before image background perfect so let's import image background here and then the first guy we're going to make it image background no no not your waves right there wait what is [ __ ] happening no no you want this uh the first one i don't want it in the [ __ ] wavy image styling i want it on its own right okay um am i not seeing it because it's a background image wait resize okay you you need to add a couple of styling stuff so there's a resize mode wait what's the error happening here style that what the [ __ ] is this error every time i comment out your view hold up with what is it because oh this is this is but isn't it an object should be like that yeah makes sense okay i don't know that's an integer oh what um let's actually do what this [ __ ] what where'd i do this instead this is what the documentation i can see it says like ah wait wait okay so so the container needs to be flex one flex direction column for some reason i don't care now let's just add it um okay do whatever you want i'm gonna look in oh okay okay that makes sense container flex one so yeah container flex one and flex direction column it's or it's uh i just add it there uh let me just comment these out for real quick see how that hap how that will turn out now we just need like we don't need you bro this is exciting um wow damn that's sick as [ __ ] um wait wait wait wait wait wait but i want this to be the same color as that dark mode screen that we had because that was sick okay we just need to uh change the color there but not touching anything else you're you're at the right place yep so that's where you set the color like i think like that color ah that's i think that's too dark so what was that color that it gave us like that uhhuh something like that i i think yeah yo bro like there is the ui kitten dark mode color hold on let's get rabbit from them because they had a pretty nice uh dark theme color going on it was this one right it was one of these i think the 800 one it's pretty good is it 800 okay oh [ __ ] dude i'm gonna start coding every single day fighting as [ __ ] it is so fun bro wait it's not ah why does it look so dark here but like then when i actually pick it it's like not dark at all but that was the color somewhere like ah yeah that's good that's good probably you're going way too dark like this i think ah i think that's that's good yeah that's good right okay let's go yep like i like purple colors dude i really do like me too ah like a good purple better than ah [ __ ] okay or let's just try this dark one the one that we did get so let's drop it in let's grab the name of this and name it final two and name this final like this okay look at that look at that um how can i um can should we zoom out the image the background no no no no i i think i think um can we zoom it out a little bit center you want to go lex part about this boom [ __ ] that you can do flex dash start or something right oh okay react native flex start i want to zoom the image out you see what i'm saying so i can like see the [ __ ] hold on um hold on dude i'm gonna take that [ __ ] image let's do it like this okay so let's grab uh that's what i'm saying it looks way better like this yeah yeah i mean we just need like a good vertical images like that and then like [ __ ] let's go ahead beautiful so we got or should this be called the hero image right it's like really easy to understand i don't know the terminology what the [ __ ] is any hero image it's like the hero image you know like bam main one like the main [ __ ] oh okay okay dude this is so cool we learned how to make [ __ ] waves oh what the [ __ ] is sick um [ __ ] now we just need to go to noob app and like do a couple of things uh definitely need to wrap up our app in this provider that's for sure gosh this [ __ ] simulator is ass i hate the tradeoffs it's like okay so you could do the whole regular reacting but that's just really really really hard really hard okay or you could go the expo round it's gonna be really easy but it's not gonna work yeah pretty much you're like um okay um this one's not gonna work because you're not gonna be able to figure it out it's because it's not gonna work because it's [ __ ] [ __ ] let's add another button underneath that so hold on let's do it like this okay so i know you gave this button some styling and stuff like that where did you color it okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to remove some of the styling background color and default is blue you don't like it i do but on the dark blue background the light blue let's go success on it let's go status is equal to success because that's gonna work out oh vim mode in dark mode so i'm pretty [ __ ] good actually okay actually i'm see you two weeks from now we know you're doing this you're playing with a [ __ ] whim how do i install i can install packages and [ __ ] too in here i'm not sure i want to give our own [ __ ] one last try yeah like i'm gonna i'm gonna develop here in the future what happened no no it's just so discouraging that [ __ ] metro doesn't work sometimes so we have to like debug the [ __ ] out of everything yeah can you unselect everything oh yeah thank you yeah i actually just went to you this expo [ __ ] and i don't i don't [ __ ] find a way to install packages oh wait add dependency yeah so let's give it a try afterwards it's like if we keep [ __ ] get running into errors or some [ __ ] we'll give it a try let me try warning warning i feel like it might look pretty freaking cool because i love the orange color and it's like very clever programmy right yeah yeah yeah um i love it [ __ ] that's how this video should start okay so we've made pretty good progress i mean not having any skills in front end then not having react native skills and not knowing not ever doing any wave [ __ ] to putting together what we did i'm [ __ ] impressed um so now let's say so actually what we should say is start learning to code right and then we should have get started underneath there so let's actually see if we can write text here let's go text and let's go start what the [ __ ] does it say it's not there it's [ __ ] right like i don't even know how to [ __ ] inspect tools in the [ __ ] i don't think you can because i mean at the end of the day you're like looking at swift stuff all right so i see okay so i see this button looks juicy i can click it that's a good sign now how do i add the text underneath there to start learning the code because i'm not seeing the text it's because i mean i gave my text the same [ __ ] styling as a button so i should see the text right i guess yep so i'm trying to make it work and uh because it's position absolute and all of the good stuff you know let's go color and i'll go white i don't see [ __ ] dude why is this so [ __ ] hard to just do normal comments and stuff it's like add a text two hours later oh i know how to add text it's like [ __ ] that you and i would have like finished in react yes so long ago i know i would have finished it this whole [ __ ] episode bro um so where is the text why don't i see it uh what no [ __ ] idea i literally gave it the same styling as the button oh [ __ ] okay wait why'd you leave the session because you kicked me out i guess i didn't but i don't know i'm joining again so it's all good face id okay so this is looking really good we have our landing page looking really really beautiful um i wish i could add a little bit of text somewhere um i probably will at some point but i think this is pretty freaking good for now let me actually try adding text like that so there's text being added all the way to the top there which is interesting so let's look at the styling of this layout we got container direction is column okay i would like to add text here just looking good right yeah [ __ ] insane dude like look at this this looks cool right oh yeah what's crazy is that that's a button because i couldn't add a text there you know i don't know why i couldn't add a text there so i just made it a button and it's a button with a ghost outline hey don't [ __ ] around with my button what are you doing so i added a button with the ghost appearance and a basic status so that gives you a button like that okay okay yeah so how i started adding text i'm going to delete your text david is um i started adding text like this so you now see my wow is showing up on the background i see you put it in a safe area too it's good it's good i would like it to be kind of like uh where they have theirs so like if i go here you see they have theirs like underneath the photo says start learning to code so something like that would be cool but like we were having a lot of difficulty so what we had to do was kind of do weird [ __ ] like we use position absolute for these buttons um and yeah to add that text i mean i could do position absolute but that you know i don't know it feels like i'm doing something wrong all right so what i would probably do um in this situation right is like i would wrap all of this in a in a view right like the uh the buttons give me just one second before you go on uh yeah let me actually hide that wow text because i don't really need it right now so save save um add cp mobile app landing page get push wait there's nowhere to push all right um let's go let's see let's see and you have like image so i would have a uh so the whole app i think is in layout and then we have the wave container and i have no idea where the wave container is how big it is no idea i don't know how to do inspect element and react native yeah me either um i think if we have uh let's see like if we had a uh a view wrapped around your buttons and the line of text that you want to add and set the top margin to auto it'll it'll push everything down over the uh the wave uh and if we set the bottom margin it will so you're saying kind of like wrap all of this in a view but it already isn't a view right but inside of that uh oh is it already inside of that waves container okay so wave container has the image and the buttons and i think and then this is the image that it has so what happens when you put a text a text element in there i'll show you what happens there's a text element and it doesn't exist anywhere let's go what does uh styles dot can i have a link to get into the code sent it in our chat okay cool dude react native is so much more annoying than [ __ ] straight up react yeah but it can do it can do a lot of things though like being able to do like desktop without being such a memory sync like uh like a uh electron i see it's like some [ __ ] time to get to get used to like for real clever programmers we'll go new go cp react native app creating the repository we'll add a team to it invite teams the squad yeah um write code and uh all right so none of us can figure out how to add a text right i'm trying it out right now all right lamb whatever idea you got just go for it ask for forgiveness you know not permission the way you see anything render and react native is you have to save like 20 times and refresh does the different firebase [ __ ] my life dude i want to just develop and react js bro why why can't we just do that why do we have to [ __ ] no metro's not gonna let me in oh wait hold on you can see it here just hit save and you'll see it on my ecam that's so weird where is the text hmm okay z index let's see the index one i'm going to say text style see if area view it's inside the vwaves let's see yeah i don't see anything what the heck but if i take it out of here all right so as soon as you bring it into waves all right that's like though bro let's just sit there let me shave oh shouldn't the safe
