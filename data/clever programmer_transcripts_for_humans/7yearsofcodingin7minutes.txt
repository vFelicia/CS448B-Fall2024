00:23 - being able to charge clients good money
00:26 - per month and and you know what and
00:29 - living a good lifestyle all right so it
00:31 - all starts out in 2012 back in high
00:34 - school it was 11th grade and I took my
00:36 - first web design class now back then we
00:40 - were doing using Dreamweaver so we were
00:42 - building a very basic applications very
00:45 - simple websites and but you know what in
00:48 - the end they were very beautiful and it
00:50 - looked good all right by the way this

01:24 - have your password safe and secure in
01:27 - 2012 as well I built my first personal
01:30 - website and it was called tech help org
01:32 - and that website was made for to review
01:36 - technical products and to write blogs
01:39 - and and at the same time just to learn
01:42 - how it is to learn coding in 2013 I went
01:47 - ahead and out and I did that did
01:49 - something crazy on the sidelines while
01:51 - still taking the same web design class
01:53 - that from high school I decided to
01:56 - completely redo the whole schools
01:58 - website as a surprise I didn't tell
02:00 - anyone I was doing by myself like in the
02:02 - end I showed it to my teacher and the
02:04 - teacher loved it and we ended up
02:06 - actually deploying it and
02:08 - and the school used this website for the
02:10 - next three years as their landing page
02:13 - so in 2014 I I joined college and the
02:17 - thing is that's when I realized that
02:20 - college in itself is not enough for you
02:23 - to later on go on
02:24 - and do work and to be to be hired by
02:28 - companies like Google and to be hired by
02:31 - start or to even learn and that for that
02:33 - matter so that's why in January of 2015
02:37 - I decided to join a startup in fact I
02:41 - joined a complete creative computing
02:43 - Club initially and I saw these two guys
02:45 - these two guys who were building some
02:47 - kind of application so I asked them what
02:50 - are you guys doing they said we're
02:52 - building an app I'm like that's amazing
02:54 - can I join so alright ok so I asked him
02:59 - the potentially work for free
03:00 - and return they teach me and I can get
03:03 - experience for that time going through
03:06 - 2015 was honestly one the best years of
03:09 - my life honestly we were building a
03:12 - startup we were I was learning a lot of
03:14 - new skills I was learning Django I was
03:16 - only Python I was learning angularjs and
03:18 - so many other technologies that I was
03:21 - excited about right but the most part is
03:24 - I was working with the team as well and
03:26 - it was working with the team you get to
03:28 - build a really some really cool
03:29 - applications one of the applications we
03:31 - build was called trend allah' and that
03:33 - was an application that was literally
03:34 - curating clothing for people who are
03:38 - using it so start now in 2016
03:41 - sorry 2016 I decided I wanted to get an
03:43 - internship I had my experience but I
03:45 - needed to do something with that
03:47 - experience right so I decided to apply
03:49 - for jobs as I was working at the startup
03:52 - I applied for the first one I applied it
03:54 - was Twitter apply for Twitter it got
03:57 - rejected in a month I applied for
03:59 - Palantir they did went through all the
04:02 - interviews they flew me out to
04:03 - California I did four rounds of
04:06 - interviews got rejected by them too then
04:09 - I apply for Squarespace at this great
04:12 - space I did a really cool project for
04:13 - them right and a couple of days Kerry
04:16 - ejected by them too then I applied for
04:18 - Google
04:19 - I applied for Google they flew me out to
04:22 - Cali are they five rounds of interviews
04:24 - and they got rejected by those but then
04:27 - finally in 2016 I asked my friend who
04:31 - was working at a company called urban
04:32 - science now he he introduced me to the
04:36 - he gave my resume to the recruiter the
04:39 - recruiter contacted me and then right
04:41 - away I got the internship in about a
04:43 - week they also talked about the power
04:45 - connections that is the one of the most
04:47 - important things that I learned in this
04:48 - space if you know someone you're a lot
04:51 - more likely to get that that that job or
04:55 - the internship or whatever less that you
04:56 - want all right through my second half of
04:58 - 2016
04:59 - I was doing an internship with that
05:00 - company called urban science right
05:02 - through them I gave three months three
05:04 - months of very interesting work where I
05:07 - was working with a lot of data
05:09 - I was actually building a a program that
05:11 - was combining data from from databases
05:14 - that had millions and millions of rows
05:17 - right and then interestingly enough in
05:20 - that time I decided to learn to learn
05:23 - machine learning on my own I took a
05:26 - Udacity course for free and I applied it
05:29 - to the actual project I was doing with
05:32 - them I applied it and then I presented
05:35 - it they loved it an Olfa sudden I was on
05:39 - a different team let's forward to fall
05:41 - of 2016 I got a new team it was a
05:45 - software analytics intern it was a lot
05:47 - more interesting I was working with
05:49 - people who had master's degrees who had
05:51 - PhDs and I was doing very interesting
05:53 - work working with nodejs and machine
05:56 - learning in Python and honestly is one
05:58 - of the best times I've ever had now
06:01 - through that time right after that fall
06:04 - 2016 at the end of the internship they
06:07 - actually gave me a full-time offer to
06:09 - start right after I finished college
06:11 - which was amazing January 2017
06:15 - I finished my internship I start
06:18 - something called a senior design class
06:20 - and it's your design class you actually
06:22 - build a real project that's going to be
06:25 - used in the real world and we've built a
06:27 - project called canvas well it was a
06:29 - mimic of canvas maybe some of you might
06:31 - know but this project
06:33 - was allow students to to to do
06:37 - assignments on courses to create groups
06:39 - and it was a very complicated project
06:41 - and involved many people but it taught
06:43 - us a lot of things through May 2017 I
06:47 - was finishing college we finished that
06:49 - project we turned it in we got an A
06:51 - which was great and then I was supposed
06:54 - to start my might my full-time job at
06:58 - urban science but there was one issue at
07:01 - the end of the college time as I was
07:02 - supposed to start working I had a friend
07:05 - who introduced me to a star that he was
07:07 - working at and he told me amen
07:10 - we got a job here if you want it you got
07:12 - it so I decided like you know what why
07:14 - not I applied I went for an interview
07:17 - and about a week I got an offer so now I
07:21 - had two issues the issue was one either
07:23 - go to startup or or or work at a bigger
07:27 - company right they already gave me an
07:29 - offer and I just can't took the leap of
07:32 - faith I decide to look at a startup I
07:34 - told the other company that I couldn't
07:35 - do it I'm sorry and I decided to go the
07:38 - path of working with a friend of mine at
07:40 - this startup called service comm June
07:42 - 2017 I am working at a start-up right we
07:46 - are building this really cool
07:47 - application where we are connecting
07:49 - contractors and customers to get work

07:55 - things I'm learning
07:56 - angularjs I mean learning testing I'm
07:58 - learning Django I'm learning Django rest
08:00 - and so much more I saw a year and a half
