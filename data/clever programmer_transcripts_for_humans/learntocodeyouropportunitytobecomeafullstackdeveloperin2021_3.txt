03:26 - yeah for example a product a slack
03:29 - is a sas product discord is a sas
03:31 - product
03:32 - so you need when you work at those

04:04 - their time and we're also going to give
04:06 - you video feedback and video review
04:09 - okay not every single person is going to
04:11 - get that so just be aware of that

08:21 - is me i'm quasi the guy drinking the
08:23 - coffee here
08:24 - um you know i hate to say any of this
08:27 - because it sounds douchey
08:28 - but um i i work really really hard and i
08:31 - figured out how to be making a hundred
08:32 - thousand dollar a year income
08:34 - while i was going to college and i was
08:36 - doing that from development working
08:37 - remotely
08:39 - at this point i've had the privilege to
08:41 - teach lots and lots of students i mean
08:43 - you know just to give you guys a little
08:44 - bit i started because i was like
08:47 - really dumb and coding was really hard
08:49 - for me to learn and i was like failing
08:50 - math classes and the way that
08:52 - instructors taught me just didn't work
08:53 - for me at all
08:54 - so i'm like screw this and i started
08:56 - learning it in my own way
08:58 - and started getting mentorship to learn
09:00 - it in my own way
09:02 - and then i started getting good picking
09:03 - up the skills and i was just obsessed
09:05 - with coding so i was coding like 10 to
09:06 - 15 hours a day
09:08 - and then within like three to six months
09:10 - i started actually working with clients
09:12 - and landing clients but a lot of it
09:13 - came from obsession and i just want to
09:15 - emphasize the amount of hard work
09:18 - and uh you know not really you know i'm
09:21 - smart but i'm not
09:22 - that smart i just work really really
09:24 - freaking hard
09:25 - so that's that's where i make it up uh
09:27 - so you know now we have a youtube
09:29 - channel that's almost about to hit a
09:30 - million subscribers
09:32 - i'm super excited about and i want to
09:34 - just take all of the things that we're
09:36 - learning and i want to share that with
09:37 - you guys is that okay with you guys

10:22 - the same
10:24 - yeah i mean guys it's really a blessing
10:26 - to have a person like nas working
10:28 - alongside you he's one of the best
10:29 - problem solvers and thinkers i've ever
10:31 - come across
10:33 - in the world of software development and
10:34 - i know many developers i have friends
10:36 - who are like
10:37 - you know work the smartest people
10:39 - working at google working on some of the
10:40 - hardest problems and even with that

11:20 - of jobs are you guys doing

11:23 - think about from her perspective right
11:25 - she was doing
11:25 - uh tax law that has nothing to do with
11:27 - software development yeah she was able
11:29 - to make that switch
11:30 - so if you're thinking about switching
11:32 - your career and going from your current
11:33 - job to a new job
11:35 - it's possible for you okay and she also
11:38 - loves coffee
11:39 - and uh anime i like anime too anybody
11:42 - else here likes anime
11:46 - i've never been i've never been a big
11:47 - fan of some reason
11:49 - yeah we should have a lot of people so
11:51 - we have people who are doing lots of uh
11:56 - wow brilliant i love anime nice
12:00 - i know death note i watched uh uh attack
12:03 - on titan that was a lot of fun
12:05 - big naruto fan awesome ending all right
12:08 - so now
12:10 - let's take a look at what you guys are
12:11 - going to be building so i apologize guys
12:13 - because we have so
12:14 - much information and value we want to
12:16 - share we're probably going to be going
12:18 - at a little
12:18 - faster pace is that cool with you guys
12:21 - okay we're going to be kind of like
12:22 - going fast
12:24 - all right so so have your if you guys
12:27 - want to screenshot it with your computer
12:29 - or just take notes just be prepared to
12:31 - go fast and stay on pace because
12:33 - there might be some slides you see that
12:35 - we're just going to keep going faster
12:37 - through them okay so one project you
12:39 - guys are going to be building is a
12:41 - startup landing page that's going to be
12:43 - worth 10k or more
12:46 - you guys are going to be building a rock
12:47 - paper scissors game using
12:49 - advanced javascript and you guys are
12:51 - going to be building a sas
12:52 - product with esx javascript okay so when
12:54 - i say sas product
12:56 - think of like you know what slack looks
12:58 - and feels like think of what discord
13:00 - looks and feels like
13:01 - okay so those are sas products that are
13:04 - successful so imagine basically building
13:06 - three project guys in these next five
13:07 - days and then putting them on your
13:09 - portfolio
13:10 - to be able to showcase to you know uh
13:12 - potential employers
13:14 - potential you know uh you know maybe
13:16 - freelancing projects and so forth
13:18 - yeah there's a lot of opportunity we're
13:20 - gonna have a lot of fun as well yeah and
13:22 - the job of
13:23 - projects that go on your portfolio is
13:25 - get recruiters attention
13:27 - that's pretty much the number one job of
13:29 - your portfolio
13:31 - then once they bring you in the rest is
13:34 - up to them
13:35 - okay but that gets you most of the times
13:38 - in the door and gets you
13:39 - we want to help you with okay and this
13:41 - is our goal is that your portfolio looks
13:43 - great
13:44 - okay so for example here's a portfolio
13:46 - one of our students he has instagram
13:48 - clone built a blogging app built he has
13:50 - multiple different
13:51 - projects that he's built this is
13:52 - actually david
13:54 - yeah who who was one of our students
13:57 - yeah and now he's working with us
14:00 - all right um so now the question is
14:03 - hopefully you guys are ready to to get
14:06 - going
14:06 - and uh you know hopefully you guys are
14:08 - ready to bring it
14:09 - your all all right bring your a game
14:12 - bring your energy of course
14:15 - and bring attention guys and most
14:16 - importantly bring time into this okay
14:19 - these next five days are going to take
14:20 - up a lot of time so make sure you put a
14:22 - lot of effort into this because this is
14:23 - going to be probably the most
14:24 - one of the most important things you
14:25 - learn yeah and it matters right so
14:28 - everybody who's sitting there prepared
14:30 - like i see jessica simpson she's sitting
14:31 - in a good posture she has her pen
14:33 - it looks like she's going to take notes
14:35 - can it matters right so like
14:37 - actually being prepared for this and
14:39 - kind of bringing your heart and energy
14:41 - you're going to retain a lot of
14:42 - information
14:43 - if you're kicking back you're just like
14:46 - sleeping
14:47 - you're not at home or in a good spot
14:50 - you're not gonna take away a lot out of
14:52 - this
14:52 - okay so that's important for you to know
14:54 - i see back she's got her notebook
14:56 - already ready and she's somewhere in
14:57 - hawaii
14:58 - as well so that's pretty cool yeah i
15:00 - love that that's absolutely amazing
15:03 - okay so let's go boot campers and let's
15:06 - get going and thank you guys for doing
15:08 - so many amazing posts like the
15:10 - engagement was
15:11 - crazy insane in this challenge like
15:15 - all of you guys went absolutely bananas
15:17 - so you we had like ashley make a post
15:20 - and she's like hey i'm from london
15:21 - by the way any other people here from
15:23 - london or uk it's kind of cool
15:25 - but it seems like she's complaining like
15:27 - hey it's
15:28 - university and things like that like the
15:30 - way that she was learning is
15:31 - boring do any of you guys resonate with
15:33 - that
15:34 - has like boring instructors or you just
15:37 - fi found learning boring
15:38 - i've i've had instructors who literally
15:40 - just go to like you know presentation
15:42 - just read off presentation literally and
15:43 - that's literally all they do
15:45 - nothing else
15:48 - abigail you know albert albert lives in
15:52 - los angeles hey what's going
15:54 - on maybe when we're doing the challenge
15:56 - in person next month hopefully
15:58 - albert can join oh another uk student
16:01 - abigail
16:02 - that's awesome lucas is in virginia
16:05 - cool wesley and it just goes on and on
16:08 - like you guys went absolutely crazy
16:09 - just know that we love your engagement
16:11 - we're reading all the comments we're
16:12 - doing our best to reply to almost all of
16:15 - you okay
16:15 - so it really that connection to us
16:17 - really matters yeah
16:19 - and keep the engagement up guys very
16:21 - very important okay this is how you
16:22 - connect with other people
16:23 - and it's also how we connect with you
16:26 - yep
16:26 - absolutely so this is the plan for the
16:30 - next five days
16:31 - day one today we're gonna talk about
16:32 - your opportunity to become a developer
16:34 - day two we're gonna build that landing
16:36 - page day three we're gonna build a game
16:39 - with javascript
16:40 - day four we're gonna work on the sas
16:42 - product and then day five
16:44 - we're gonna build your ultimate
16:46 - developer roadmap to become a full stack
16:48 - developer
16:49 - so what that basically means is we're
16:50 - going to give you all the technology
16:52 - all the tools you need so you're not
16:54 - learning like a million different things
16:56 - that are not
16:56 - actually helping you in your career cool
17:00 - and uh today we're going to be making
17:02 - making sure that you
17:04 - learn the opportunity and we're gonna
17:05 - kind of unravel
17:07 - some of the myths around becoming a
17:09 - developer
17:13 - okay so let's deep dive into building
17:16 - your personal roadmap
17:17 - all right let's see and what what we
17:19 - want to do is let's actually figure out
17:22 - why you want to become a developer
17:24 - because that's a good question that's
17:25 - because a lot of people you know
17:27 - you know think about this and actually
17:28 - they go into this for the wrong reason
17:30 - that's something that we see a lot a lot
17:33 - in people
17:34 - yes so here's what we want you guys to
17:38 - write down in the zoom chat right now
17:40 - what are three things that are actually
17:43 - more important to you than
17:44 - money yeah all right if you want to
17:46 - succeed in becoming a developer
17:48 - this is really the only way where you
17:50 - know what is more important to you than
17:51 - money because if that's the only reason
17:53 - you're doing it
17:54 - then that's you're not going to actually
17:56 - go really far with it okay so i want to
17:58 - start seeing what are your guys's three
18:00 - reasons
18:01 - so we have alex sanderson says knowledge
18:04 - stability and family memory says
18:05 - stability
18:07 - having fun family friends and health
18:09 - immanuel is helping people with
18:10 - technology
18:18 - charles says skill education and travel
18:22 - i like that that's really good
18:25 - set my own schedule build cool stuff
18:28 - rajesh's knowledge individuality jessica
18:31 - simon says creativity
18:35 - these are absolutely incredible answers
18:38 - wow happiness awesome family family
18:42 - helping my family wow okay so you guys
18:45 - are starting to see the trend with the
18:46 - other people hopefully maybe you're
18:48 - seeing it resonate a little bit with you
18:50 - as well
18:50 - but family is definitely an important
18:52 - thing that that a lot of you guys are
18:54 - saying
18:55 - learning the skill is important to you
18:56 - it seems like and of course the
18:58 - opportunity to have freedom
19:00 - and kind of you know either choose your
19:02 - own schedule or be
19:04 - or work from wherever you want okay so
19:06 - those are a couple of things you guys
19:07 - said
19:08 - none of them are wrong it's just what is
19:09 - important to you okay so remember those
19:11 - three things you said because you're
19:13 - gonna
19:13 - that's going to help craft what type of
19:16 - role
19:17 - you look for when you're becoming a
19:18 - developer okay
19:21 - and now let's maybe just talk about what
19:23 - can making money as a developer help you
19:25 - achieve in your life okay
19:26 - so quickly just give me if you were
19:28 - making a decent amount of money
19:30 - what can that help you do more okay
19:33 - what can that help you with in your life
19:36 - buy a house stability education
19:40 - uh give my daughter oh it's moving so
19:43 - fast i love
19:44 - this pay off debt oh wow there's so much
19:48 - insane help my daughter with school
19:54 - pay your student loans i love that give
19:56 - my wife and son a good life
19:57 - and for those of you on youtube as well
19:59 - make sure you guys to comment that down
20:00 - below as well i'm really curious to see
20:02 - what you guys are saying too
20:04 - rediane just wants to buy cars nothing
20:06 - wrong with that either
20:07 - house and travel i love that travel is
20:09 - not a bad thing nothing's wrong with
20:10 - that guys no judgment here so that's
20:11 - totally okay
20:12 - give mother a good life that's pretty
20:14 - cool i like that satisfaction discover
20:16 - the world
20:16 - that's right my girlfriend why do you
20:18 - need money to marry your girlfriend
20:20 - i mean you know weddings are not cheap
20:26 - okay fair enough i love this so this is
20:29 - this is really good because i want you
20:31 - guys to know what's important to you
20:33 - because you need three reasons why
20:35 - you're gonna code even if you didn't get
20:36 - paid
20:37 - right and then it's also good to know
20:38 - why you need the money if you did get
20:41 - if you were making money getting paid to
20:43 - code
20:44 - okay so that's absolutely great now
20:48 - let's quickly figure out your income
20:49 - goals as we keep going okay
20:51 - so how much income do you want to make
20:54 - per
20:55 - month all right so the reason why i ask
20:58 - this question
20:58 - is it determines a lot like for example
21:01 - maybe some of you might not need to make
21:03 - that much money some some of you may be
21:04 - happy with making
21:05 - two thousand dollars a month and what
21:07 - that might allow you to do is
21:09 - code part-time work remotely be a
21:11 - freelancer
21:12 - or some of you might be like hey i want
21:14 - to be making five seven thousand
21:16 - ten thousand dollars a month and i wanna
21:17 - be working at a big company and i'm okay
21:20 - working 40 hours a week and i'm okay
21:22 - there none of those are wrong okay
21:23 - because you can learn a lot from working
21:25 - at big companies and working full-time
21:28 - so what is your income goal that's
21:30 - important for you to know
21:31 - yeah and it's 12k a month wow eight to
21:34 - 10k
21:35 - 5k 10k a month 10k a month 2k
21:39 - 75k a month holy molly 75k a year right
21:42 - okay
21:42 - somebody said 20k a month these are some
21:44 - good numbers yeah just don't don't be
21:46 - unrealistic guys right you know
21:48 - don't say it like you know i want to
21:49 - make a million a month right it's very
21:51 - important
21:52 - i've had people say that right so want
21:54 - to be realistic with it as well
21:57 - yeah yeah he's not saying don't be
21:59 - optimistic yeah it means be realistic
22:01 - because you can't take
22:03 - 20 steps on a la you know at once you
22:05 - kind of go you got to go to level one
22:07 - level two so if you can
22:08 - prove you can make a hundred dollars
22:10 - with coding then yes you're more likely
22:11 - to then make a thousand dollars a month
22:13 - with coding
22:14 - okay so a lot of you i saw 5k 10k a
22:16 - month
22:17 - that's that's a pretty good range to be
22:20 - thinking about
22:21 - all right and then the last thing you
22:23 - know we want to ask you guys
22:25 - is are you you know do you want to do
22:27 - freelancing with
22:28 - with development or do you see more
22:30 - working full-time
22:32 - okay so freelancing just party at the
22:36 - bottom
22:36 - i love that so yeah i mean both
22:40 - again both are really really good both
22:43 - are solid we just decided to put like
22:45 - random funny photos here
22:47 - but which one do you want to do
22:50 - full-time full-time full-time so which
22:52 - one you you did guys which one did you
22:54 - do
22:55 - we should almost have a poll for that
22:57 - that's actually cool
22:59 - um what i did actually mostly
23:01 - freelancing
23:02 - with with software development
23:06 - personally
23:09 - yeah i mean i did full time i did
23:11 - freelancing but i kind of did both right
23:13 - though i know personally i mean i did
23:16 - enjoy both
23:17 - myself right um yeah i don't know i
23:19 - think it's really cool to experience
23:22 - you know the freelancer side and the
23:23 - full-time side and then you kind of kind
23:25 - of see
23:25 - which which side is for you because i'll
23:27 - be honest with you you know
23:29 - not eat not like freelancing might not
23:32 - be your thing
23:33 - or full-time might not be your thing you
23:34 - know right
23:36 - yeah so it's definitely good cool to
23:37 - experience both because with freelancing
23:39 - for example you have to deal with a lot
23:41 - more instability
23:43 - not knowing when you're going to have
23:45 - work next and a lot of those things
23:47 - right with full time
23:48 - you have job security you don't have to
23:50 - worry about where you're going to get
23:52 - work from or paid from next month but
23:55 - freelancing
23:56 - if you were working on one type of
23:58 - project you didn't like it you can
23:59 - quickly pick another client and work on
24:01 - a completely different thing tomorrow
24:04 - so again both are both are good
24:07 - personally
24:07 - i think that if you could get into full
24:09 - time my recommendation would be to try
24:11 - to break into full time just because
24:12 - you're gonna learn so freaking much
24:14 - and you will get mentorship there you
24:16 - will have some other developers that can
24:18 - teach you
24:18 - so from just a skill perspective charles
24:20 - like for example how you said
24:22 - number one is skill for you right just
24:24 - from a skill perspective alone
24:26 - it's killer opportunity where you can
24:28 - pick up so much
24:30 - all right so again web developer growth
24:33 - is a lot right so why
24:35 - it depends which which one you want to
24:37 - get into but we like
24:38 - talking about web development because
24:40 - because it's it is a
24:42 - faster growing than almost any other
24:44 - industry
24:45 - because even for example think of
24:46 - somebody that wants to do data science
24:48 - right maybe they're just like
24:49 - in this 12 growth that they're doing
24:51 - data science even they at some point
24:53 - need to learn web development because
24:54 - then somebody needs to take that data
24:56 - and those and those graphs and put
24:59 - them online
25:00 - right like it can't just live on a
25:02 - freaking pdf
25:04 - what are you gonna print it out you know
25:06 - so like even when stack overflow comes
25:08 - up with your service somebody needs to
25:09 - actually visualize those graphs and put
25:11 - them on the web
25:12 - so at some point that same data
25:14 - scientist is going to need some web
25:16 - development skills
25:17 - so why we like web development a lot is
25:19 - you can become a web developer
25:21 - or you can break out into other
25:26 - into other verticals like data science
25:28 - and still be
25:29 - still be great does that make sense guys
25:32 - [Music]
25:33 - okay and when i say data science just so
25:35 - everybody has an understanding i'm
25:36 - talking about like
25:37 - ai type of stuff right so there's the
25:39 - web development world and then there's
25:41 - the ai
25:42 - world okay so for example self-driving
25:45 - cars is ai
25:46 - self-checkout that that's happening
25:48 - around the world
25:49 - is is ai so even if you wanted to do
25:53 - that i think it would serve you to have
25:55 - web development
25:56 - experience
25:59 - so let's keep going here and the
26:02 - opportunity for becoming a developer is
26:04 - a lot
26:05 - okay so a lot right now yeah and it's
26:08 - growing constantly and the amount of
26:12 - um students that a computer science
26:16 - you know universities are able to pump
26:18 - out it's about like 400
26:19 - 000 per year but the demand is about 1.4
26:22 - million or more
26:23 - jobs which means that the
26:26 - amount of students is not meeting the
26:29 - needs for the
26:30 - overall jobs and so what happens it will
26:32 - happen is when you have
26:34 - more demand than supply what do what
26:36 - what do you think guys
26:37 - what happens usually when there's more
26:38 - demand versus supply what happens
26:41 - very simple what happens is higher pay
26:44 - exactly
26:44 - right so a lot of people that this is
26:46 - where basically the
26:48 - the income increases keeps increasing
26:50 - keeps increasing and we'll see later on
26:52 - that over the years the income has
26:53 - increased you know and for developer
26:55 - jobs you know what i mean
26:57 - yeah so you know even if you want to
27:00 - start off
27:00 - with maybe let's say you want to do
27:03 - software development but then maybe
27:05 - later you can think about launching your
27:07 - own company like a sas
27:09 - product or something like that right
27:10 - damn zach got excited about that i see
27:13 - that's what zac is on
27:14 - nice so if your goal is that that's
27:17 - totally great because
27:19 - it plays out in the long run because
27:21 - most of the world is moving towards
27:23 - technology right so even
27:24 - if it's not tomorrow or next year or in
27:27 - three years
27:28 - how about in the next seven years 10
27:30 - years because software development isn't
27:31 - going anywhere
27:32 - and for you to know this is a skill and
27:34 - even if you had people working
27:36 - under you if you knew the skill of
27:38 - software development you could make
27:40 - better hires that then work on your
27:42 - software
27:43 - okay so those are a couple of things to
27:45 - keep in mind it doesn't
27:46 - always mean you're permanently just
27:48 - going to be an employee even though
27:49 - that's
27:50 - pretty freaking great okay so there's a
27:52 - big gap
27:53 - and uh you know i don't know if we have
27:56 - those slides here but
27:58 - let's keep going and a lot of you know
28:00 - even here by definition you can't have
28:03 - a million more people here that are
28:04 - getting these degrees but they're still
28:06 - getting jobs which by definition means
28:08 - that majority of the people
28:09 - without degrees are actually getting
28:10 - software developer jobs and this is
28:12 - where a lot of companies sound to
28:13 - realize that
28:14 - right that it takes a long time for
28:16 - people to get through a degree
28:18 - and so a lot of people companies are
28:19 - starting to remove then yes the
28:20 - necessity for a degree instead of like
28:22 - basically looking more so
28:24 - at your experience right and what you
28:26 - can do and
28:27 - just in general just do you know how to
28:29 - code right or have you
28:31 - have you built projects and not
28:32 - necessarily just just like what you know
28:34 - from a degree that's
28:35 - it it's a game of skill yeah software
28:38 - development is a game of skill
28:39 - just like charles like you uh you you
28:42 - stream
28:43 - apex right you play a video game that's
28:46 - a game of skill
28:47 - if you were to join a league nobody
28:49 - gives a crap
28:51 - about your certification or a degree
28:53 - that you might have they just see your
28:54 - skill level in the game
28:56 - now don't don't get me wrong if there's
28:58 - a data science job you're going to they
29:00 - probably might care about you having a
29:02 - degree but like even
29:03 - elon musk says i don't give a damn about
29:05 - your degree i actually care about your
29:07 - skill level as a software developer
29:09 - so with software development because
29:11 - there's so much new technology and new
29:13 - things happening all the time
29:15 - you most of the times just need to have
29:17 - a skill and a way to prove that you have
29:18 - that skill
29:19 - so either you could rely on an 80 000
29:22 - piece of paper
29:23 - or you could rely on just good projects
29:25 - on your freaking portfolio
29:27 - that we're going to give you in this
29:28 - boot camp how does that sound
29:34 - okay it works all right so let's keep
29:37 - going
29:39 - um software engineer salaries in the us
29:43 - now on the left hand side right oh are
29:46 - those my drawings
29:47 - never went away can you remember honest
29:48 - yeah awesome okay cool cool
29:50 - so here you have javascript right 112
29:53 - dollars a year salary and then you all
29:56 - have all these other languages
29:58 - and and all languages are great but
30:00 - they're for different things
30:02 - yeah we got ios as well after sign the
30:04 - android though ios they are higher
30:06 - paying there's a lot less demand for
30:08 - it right so for ios basically this is
30:11 - when you're talking about this you're
30:12 - talking about like developing for
30:13 - iphone yeah for like literally iphone
30:15 - apps and of course the
30:17 - developing android apps as well yeah
30:20 - so for example here the cool thing about
30:23 - web development it helps you branch out
30:25 - and it has
30:26 - principles that play out in every other
30:28 - industry yeah that is meaning that if
30:29 - you learn web development and you learn
30:31 - how to do how do i talk to my database
30:34 - how do i build a user
30:36 - interface how do i what
30:39 - what i'm good right you guys can hear me
30:42 - yeah you're good
30:42 - okay cool so if i do all that i can
30:45 - still
30:46 - apply in the future and like pick up
30:49 - iphone skills iphone development skills
30:51 - ios development skills okay
30:53 - i can still pick up python and learn
30:56 - data science and stuff like that
30:58 - so what's important for you to
31:00 - understand is you're not alienating any
31:01 - other opportunities
31:03 - when you start with web development as a
31:05 - matter of fact they are
31:07 - complementary and often needed when you
31:09 - jump into other
31:10 - fields it makes sense or here for
31:13 - example when you learn javascript right
31:14 - there's a lot of opportunity around
31:16 - right around you learn react native
31:18 - which is from javascript and then being
31:20 - able to build
31:22 - applications for ios and for android at
31:24 - the same time
31:26 - yeah yeah so let's keep going
31:30 - all right now remote work during covet
31:33 - has increased a lot
31:34 - how many people experience a lot of
31:37 - different
31:37 - types of things in their heads and in
31:40 - job in the world last year like was last
31:42 - year kind of tricky and difficult for
31:43 - you guys yeah raise your hand
31:45 - with together it was for me yeah it was
31:47 - a really everybody's like oh
31:48 - you're filled with turmoil and
31:50 - unexpected events and it's like what the
31:52 - heck is going on right i'm like
31:53 - can you please just return to normal
31:55 - come on
31:57 - yeah but one something that interesting
31:59 - that happened with it within that
32:00 - is things changed and i believe a lot of
32:03 - things changed
32:04 - permanently too so now
32:08 - companies were forced to start thinking
32:10 - about how to work with talent
32:12 - remotely and then they made that shift
32:15 - from going from physical offices often
32:17 - to remote offices
32:18 - and some of some huge companies liked it
32:21 - so much they want to keep things that
32:22 - way even
32:23 - yeah it makes it easier for everybody
32:24 - like they actually found that focus
32:26 - increases a lot and and their efficiency
32:29 - has increased a lot because
32:31 - there's so much more focus on just a
32:32 - doing portion instead of doing a bunch
32:34 - of meetings
32:35 - so raise your hand raise your hand here
32:37 - guys i'm just curious
32:39 - who here loves to do remote work who
32:41 - here would love to do remote work
32:42 - everybody look at that look at that oh
32:45 - my god it just keeps going keeps going
32:48 - so the remote work portion just only
32:49 - increase and increase because
32:51 - really in the development world what do
32:52 - you need to do work
32:56 - what just your laptop
33:02 - pretty much is here nice hi
33:07 - nice to see you yeah and she would agree
33:10 - right like you need
33:11 - you preferably i'd like to have a
33:14 - monitor with my laptop
33:16 - okay preferably i'd have to have a nice
33:18 - setup when i'm coding
33:20 - so but even with that said you know you
33:22 - could work you can work
33:23 - i could have a nice setup at home as
33:26 - well so yeah
33:27 - a lot of what you need to do you are
33:29 - able to do it remotely
33:30 - i think you know for people it'll be
33:33 - always a split like sometimes i like to
33:35 - go into
33:35 - office to work sometimes i like to work
33:38 - from uh
33:38 - home what's more important is that i
33:41 - have the
33:42 - option of choosing both okay and what i
33:45 - want to share with you guys
33:46 - is that when you're doing development
33:48 - and you learn the skill you will have an
33:50 - option of choosing both okay that's one
33:53 - important thing to keep in mind so for
33:55 - those of you guys who are maybe doing
33:56 - stuff that's really hard takes all your
33:58 - time
33:58 - you're like man i just want to be with
33:59 - family more okay
34:01 - and i want to be either around my kids
34:03 - or around my girlfriend or wife whatever
34:06 - this gives you the opportunity to be
34:07 - able to do that or maybe you want to
34:09 - travel
34:10 - you know who knows yeah oh yeah now the
34:13 - world is opening up travel is the thing
34:14 - finally yeah yeah
34:19 - all right so let's now get into more
34:21 - like technical stuff as well right like
34:23 - for example
34:24 - why do we why why javascript why is this
34:27 - language
34:28 - actually helpful and why a couple of
34:30 - reasons all right
34:32 - first of all javascript is actually one
34:34 - of the most
34:36 - common and most used languages around
34:38 - the world for developers so you can see
34:39 - here on the left hand side
34:41 - all right it's one of the most powerful
34:43 - languages and and
34:44 - in a big picture perspective everything
34:46 - is from javascript okay so like if i
34:48 - just if i get out of here
34:50 - if i get out of this slide and i and i
34:52 - go to youtube
34:54 - you know all of this all of everything
34:56 - that you see here is javascript
34:58 - yeah i mean basically the whole the
35:00 - whole world wide web
35:02 - is built on javascript guys yeah when i
35:04 - click history or when i click this
35:06 - even when i hover my mouse and all this
35:09 - stuff is happening and
35:10 - what happens when i click live what
35:12 - happens when i click chess
35:13 - this is all javascript right when i go
35:16 - on instagram
35:18 - this isn't just like weird stuff that
35:20 - we're nerding out and talking about this
35:22 - is
35:22 - real stuff that's happening right now
35:24 - when i hit the play button
35:25 - there's a javascript video player that
35:27 - loads like literally every single thing
35:30 - that's
35:31 - online has javascript for those of you
35:34 - who are killing on zoom and you guys are
35:36 - watching this right and zoom through
35:38 - the web version of zoom that's also
35:40 - using javascript
35:41 - youtube you're watching on youtube what
35:42 - is that javascript guys right so
35:45 - that platoon that's a software somebody
35:47 - made and sold it to
35:48 - google for a billion dollars right and
35:51 - that software uses a lot of javascript
35:54 - so that's why these skills matter yeah
35:58 - all right so let's keep going and uh
36:01 - here is you know again another survey by
36:04 - stack overflow where javascript is
36:06 - clearly the number one
36:07 - and then for in terms of web frameworks
36:10 - and you guys should write this down as
36:12 - well if hopefully you're taking notes
36:14 - but in terms of learning frameworks we
36:17 - recommend that you learn
36:18 - react okay you don't have to learn it
36:20 - right away but put it
36:22 - on your roadmap to learning because it
36:25 - is
36:26 - hot right now and it's going to continue
36:28 - being hot
36:29 - and facebook started using it you guys
36:32 - saw facebook's ui
36:33 - change right like you guys saw facebook
36:35 - change a lot right where
36:37 - it used to kind of look like trash a few
36:39 - years ago
36:40 - now they did their ui update and looks
36:42 - cool and looks
36:43 - awesome they're using react and facebook
36:47 - actually created react for internal use
36:49 - and then they're like wait why don't we
36:50 - just open source this and they did and
36:52 - the whole world is like hey we want to
36:54 - start using react and then
36:56 - instagram jumped on it and a lot of
36:58 - other big companies
36:59 - are now jumping on it okay so a good one
37:02 - good tool to to learn about
37:06 - now another thing we want to touch base
37:07 - on is what can you actually do with
37:09 - javascript so
37:10 - top tech companies are using javascript
37:12 - so facebook linkedin
37:13 - microsoft ebay tesla groupon
37:17 - netflix all these companies have used
37:20 - or used javascript in some way or some
37:23 - shape
37:23 - okay and when it comes to types of web
37:27 - apps you can build here are the types of
37:29 - web apps you can actually build with
37:30 - javascript okay so on the left hand side
37:33 - you have facebook and that's built with
37:36 - javascript and react
37:37 - okay in the middle you have a server app
37:41 - which is you know netflix probably a lot
37:44 - by the way show of hands how many people
37:45 - here have a netflix account
37:48 - oh yeah probably everybody wow that's
37:51 - awesome that's super cool
37:53 - so netflix uses javascript okay
37:57 - and then even ios android apps use it
38:00 - to a certain extent so these are all
38:02 - types of things you can build with them
38:04 - okay and there are tons of myths of
38:06 - becoming a developer such as do i need
38:08 - to have a degree to get a job as a
38:09 - developer
38:10 - uh the answer is you know hold on let's
38:13 - see if uh
38:15 - i'm just gonna do stuff on the fly
38:16 - hopefully that's that's okay with you
38:18 - guys
38:21 - let's see uh if this video is there okay
38:24 - i'll let i'll let
38:26 - my my friend elon say some of this stuff
38:30 - now i do have to share it where i share
38:31 - my sound too
38:33 - um no no it's all good it's almost like
38:35 - you are you doing a road caster just
38:37 - stream it to world castle your sound
38:38 - should be on road caster that's it
38:40 - okay okay that's the one that's it
38:46 - no i don't hear your road caster sound
38:50 - i think you might have sound source on
38:51 - it bro college degree there we go now i
38:53 - can hear you
38:54 - the it's not it's it there's no need
38:56 - even to have a college degree
38:59 - okay at all or even high school
39:02 - the um i mean if somebody graduated from
39:05 - a great university that may be an indeed
39:07 - that may be an indication that they will
39:08 - be
39:09 - oh wait i can't show it for too long
39:10 - because copyright oh yeah yeah be
39:12 - careful oh yeah i remember it on the fly
39:17 - but i will share this part bill gates
39:20 - larry ellison steve jobs these guys
39:23 - didn't graduate from college
39:25 - but if you had a chance to hire them of
39:26 - course that would be
39:28 - a good idea i love that yeah
39:31 - yeah i love this guy so of course you
39:34 - know not everybody's bill gates or steve
39:36 - jobs or elon musk but also what's
39:38 - important to understand
39:39 - is that it's not always needed and
39:42 - elon is like elon is now the tony stark
39:46 - of real world
39:47 - right he's the real life iron man so
39:49 - when he does it sends
39:51 - it sets trends right like when apple and
39:53 - iphone does it sets trends when i
39:56 - apple is like hey now laptops are not
39:59 - going to have disk trays anymore
40:00 - disk trays are gone like no computer
40:03 - comes with that anymore right now apple
40:05 - is like usb c is the and then like
40:07 - android and everybody's like oh
40:09 - no offense to anybody who's using
40:10 - android here but like i'm sure things
40:12 - are gonna start changing to that
40:13 - direction right
40:14 - so when elon says things like that a lot
40:16 - of companies are like okay
40:18 - maybe there's different criteria we need
40:20 - to hire people on and maybe
40:22 - a boarding algorithm isn't the answer
40:25 - maybe we should look at their skills
40:27 - okay and maybe we should look past
40:28 - pieces of papers so a lot of modern tech
40:31 - companies that's what they do now
40:34 - okay so um yeah
40:39 - don't confuse schooling with education
40:41 - [Music]
40:43 - i like that and the coolest thing i
40:44 - think is to take away from this as well
40:46 - is like
40:46 - a lot of you guys think hey you know
40:47 - what nothing guys want certificates you
40:50 - want certificates
40:51 - you want to see certificates right oh
40:53 - nas i got an html set certificate you
40:56 - know
40:56 - i'm like great but do you have knowledge
40:58 - to actually build this kind of stuff
40:59 - right
41:00 - so what i think is we're trying to get
41:02 - from here is this
41:03 - it's not about degree a certificate it's
41:06 - about what you know and what you can do
41:07 - that's it yeah absolutely
41:14 - i didn't go to harvard but the people
41:16 - that work for me did
41:20 - um yeah yeah yeah
41:23 - so salary outlook you have a good salary
41:27 - outlook
41:27 - as we start to go into 2021 2022
41:32 - average salaries for software developers
41:34 - is something that's increasing
41:36 - um you know but again the
41:39 - what this also means is as time
41:41 - progresses you also need to start
41:43 - developing a stronger and stronger
41:45 - skill level okay if you have a stronger
41:47 - skill level then you can be getting paid
41:49 - higher income okay but when you start as
41:52 - a junior
41:53 - developer and you're completely starting
41:55 - out it might be a little bit lower than
41:57 - this
41:57 - right but then you can work your way up
41:59 - to this
42:02 - okay and software engineer salaries at
42:05 - these are software engineers
42:06 - saw uh salaries at tesla and this is for
42:09 - entry level entry-level people so
42:13 - literally beginners guys
42:15 - like if you're a beginner this is what
42:16 - what they're looking to give you biscuit
42:17 - if you look at those companies
42:19 - yeah so i'm just going to say that you
42:22 - have to
42:23 - there's you're still skilled and you're
42:25 - good at what you do
42:26 - and you know a lot of things if you
42:28 - don't know how to write code they're not
42:29 - going to give you the job
42:31 - but like if you're in a junior level
42:33 - developer
42:34 - this is actually what they will start
42:36 - you off with if they accept you
42:37 - yeah yeah yeah yeah cool
42:41 - so let's keep going you know uh your boy
42:44 - me uh i did drop out of college i was
42:47 - going
42:48 - i was going to college for two years
42:51 - and i was going to community college as
42:52 - well as saving money and then
42:54 - i was going to uic university of
42:56 - illinois in chicago i don't know if any
42:58 - of you guys have gone there anybody is
42:59 - from chicago at all
43:01 - um shout so shout out to chicago but
43:04 - my professor came up to me and i
43:07 - remember
43:07 - at that time i was already i had other
43:10 - developers even working for me and we
43:12 - were working for
43:13 - uh we were building this crm for a
43:15 - company and i was getting paid
43:17 - quite a bit you know um about like ten
43:20 - thousand dollars a month so i was on
43:22 - track to hit a hundred thousand dollars
43:24 - that year
43:25 - and my professor came up to me and he
43:27 - was like
43:29 - he started asking me for career advice
43:31 - and when he did that
43:32 - that was the cue for me and i was like
43:34 - okay maybe
43:36 - maybe this is the time to drop out of
43:38 - college and so i took one semester
43:40 - off and i was like if things don't work
43:42 - out i'll go back
43:44 - but then that's really when this started
43:45 - taking off and i just because i i was
43:47 - able to just go all in
43:48 - okay like can you focus your camera your
43:50 - camera's on focus for a second here
43:52 - okay there we go now you're good
43:56 - beautiful okay beautiful uh we have
43:59 - jesse who went from being a tax law
44:01 - consultant to a full stack developer
44:03 - and uh this is nasa's this is my friend
44:06 - yeah
44:06 - my friend robert and he's actually one
44:08 - of my first mentors and i
44:09 - actually literally met him by by going
44:12 - to a kuwaiti computing club and there
44:15 - he was actually building a startup
44:16 - company together with his friend steve
44:18 - and lilly joined him and he is now kind
44:21 - of he's built you can see trandala which
44:23 - was the starter company that was part of
44:25 - with them at the bottom and then he
44:27 - literally got a job at quickenload which
44:28 - is a work he's working right now
44:30 - and he's actually a lead developer there
44:32 - and he does not know how to have no
44:34 - degree
44:35 - he did go start going to college
44:36 - literally his first two years
44:38 - and then just dropped out he's like i
44:40 - don't need this so
44:42 - there you go yeah
44:45 - [Music]
44:46 - and this is what the career ladder looks
44:48 - like for you so if you want to become a
44:50 - software developer
44:52 - this is really what's happening you
44:53 - start off with being a junior software
44:55 - engineer or
44:56 - junior software developer that's your
44:58 - first title right your
44:59 - junior developer and then from there
45:03 - you go to a senior software developer
45:07 - third step up you become a lead
45:10 - developer where you're actually
45:11 - coordinating
45:12 - work within teams and sometimes you
45:14 - still write a code
45:15 - and sometimes you also become managers
45:16 - sometimes you either be a lead developer
45:18 - or you get to the managerial role
45:21 - [Music]
45:22 - technical architect where you're then
45:24 - actually focusing on designing
45:26 - systems here you become a team lead or a
45:30 - software development manager also what
45:32 - nas was talking about and here you're
45:34 - actually looking at
45:35 - projects and teams and you have power to
45:38 - hire and fire their developers
45:41 - and then the the final step is becoming
45:44 - a cto so
45:45 - that's a chief technology officer right
45:48 - so then you're actually managing the
45:49 - entire
45:50 - organization's technical needs and
45:53 - also from here you can either continue
45:56 - working at that company
45:57 - you'd go to different companies at
45:59 - higher paying jobs
46:01 - or if you wanted to it would also be a
46:03 - good time to maybe even look into
46:04 - developing something of your own
46:06 - because at this point you have tons of
46:08 - experience tons of knowledge
46:09 - okay all right
46:13 - now what's the first step that you
46:14 - should take
46:16 - what do you need to do to pass the
46:18 - interview how do you get noticed
46:20 - and so let's start actually going
46:22 - through and talking about these things
46:24 - okay
46:25 - before we we address all of those types
46:28 - of things
46:29 - cure is just one truth okay so for
46:32 - everybody who's a beginner
46:33 - and doesn't have a job right now as a
46:35 - software developer and doesn't have
46:37 - so much experience i want you guys to
46:41 - spend all your time
46:42 - learning the skills of coding it
46:46 - it takes a lot of time to really sharpen
46:48 - your skill set and actually get
46:49 - really really good at this but please
46:51 - spend majority of your time
46:53 - actually learning how to code all right
46:55 - just being competent in what you
46:57 - in what you guys in this field right
47:00 - right competency
47:01 - is what gives you confidence competency
47:03 - is what gives the opportunity
47:05 - now for those of you who don't know what
47:06 - competence is right because some of you
47:07 - guys might not know
47:08 - confidence is just you know the actual
47:10 - skill and you're being good at it
47:13 - because that's what people pay for my
47:14 - right yeah
47:16 - and confidence comes from competence
47:22 - okay so the more competent you are the
47:25 - more confident you are going to be
47:28 - you've probably experienced this in your
47:29 - life right when you guys are talking
47:31 - about a subject you don't know anything
47:32 - about you're like
47:33 - oh you have no idea what the hell to say
47:38 - but then if somebody's talking about
47:39 - things that you're good at
47:41 - or things you're passionate about all of
47:42 - a sudden your demeanor changes your
47:44 - posture changes the way your speaking
47:46 - changes you're like
47:47 - let me actually tell you how this is
47:48 - done and it's
47:50 - and it's not just random confidence that
47:52 - you just mustered out of nowhere it's
47:53 - because you're competing that skill you
47:55 - know what you're talking about
47:57 - okay so you know like i'm bad at
48:00 - construction and putting things together
48:02 - at diy stuff i'm like
48:04 - crap you know i'm garbage at that i'm
48:05 - like no don't talk to me
48:07 - somebody asked me a question i'm like oh
48:10 - i don't even know how to freaking tie a
48:11 - knot i don't know what's going on here
48:13 - but then like somebody wants to talk to
48:14 - me about chess and i'm super confident
48:16 - i'm like let me tell you about this you
48:18 - know everything changes and i'm talking
48:21 - about that
48:21 - yeah so because we we've had some people
48:25 - and without naming any names but
48:28 - where nas interviewed um
48:32 - you know interviewed uh her and she just
48:35 - didn't have
48:38 - any technical skills you know it was
48:40 - really
48:41 - really really bad like really bad
48:44 - and i think what happened in that case
48:47 - was like she had a great personality
48:49 - really high energy a wonderful
48:52 - person but i think the problem that
48:55 - happened was
48:56 - she'd heard that soft skills are really
48:59 - important
49:00 - and i think she kind of like went
49:02 - overboard with it meaning like she spent
49:04 - all her time
49:05 - making connections making relationships
49:07 - um
49:09 - meetings with people knowing everybody
49:10 - in the tech world interviewing
49:12 - sending hundreds of job offers but
49:15 - everybody that interviewed her just said
49:17 - that your technical skills are just not
49:19 - good
49:20 - yeah because like yeah i could hire
49:22 - somebody who's a great person but
49:23 - if your skills are just not there what
49:26 - am i hiring you for
49:28 - you know yeah like if that's that's
49:31 - that's the most important thing like
49:32 - like it or not
49:33 - and if you could combine both soft
49:35 - skills and technical skills
49:38 - this is where you become so in demand
49:40 - that
49:41 - people will literally throw money at you
49:43 - like there's literally companies that
49:44 - would that will fight for you
49:46 - i've had that happen from multiple
49:48 - companies
49:49 - where you know if you're really good and
49:51 - they really want you they'll just
49:52 - they'll just keep
49:53 - like okay we'll raise this up where is
49:55 - this up and like
49:56 - this is where you'll be able to get like
49:58 - big raises i went to a company where i
50:00 - started off making seventy thousand
50:02 - dollars
50:03 - and then within within literally six
50:05 - months i was able to get a razor for 80k
50:08 - right and so forth and so forth right
50:11 - yeah
50:12 - and there you go so yeah the skills will
50:15 - at the end of the day speak
50:16 - louder than everything else so one thing
50:19 - is
50:20 - you know just understand that the hours
50:22 - of you
50:23 - coding will lead to good to great
50:26 - results
50:27 - the difference is in the hours that you
50:29 - put in okay yes there are smarter
50:31 - strategies there's this and that
50:33 - but the hours are going to be you're
50:35 - defining
50:36 - you know part of your success so this is
50:38 - why this day boot camp guys
50:40 - how many hours are you going to put in
50:43 - into coding for these my five days
50:45 - let us know down in the comments below
50:47 - that's actually a great question
50:49 - yeah that's actually a great question 30
50:52 - hours holy are you asking
50:54 - per day or the whole no no the whole
50:56 - five day boot camp
50:58 - okay yeah 10 hours per day 40 hours
51:01 - 50 hours holy moly sister per day 60
51:06 - hour that you put in is for yourself so
51:09 - like if you put in overtime
51:11 - that's for yourself you know if you
51:14 - don't
51:15 - like if you put in two hours to me that
51:17 - just tells me you value yourself
51:18 - very poorly because you're well you see
51:21 - what i'm saying you're like
51:22 - hey i'm only going to invest two hours
51:24 - into this thing that's going to be my
51:26 - career
51:27 - into something that i'm going to be
51:28 - loving and doing for
51:30 - a longer period of my life you know
51:33 - if you're gonna do one to two hours
51:34 - don't do it at all all right
51:36 - um because the reason why i'm saying
51:40 - that i'm saying it from a really good
51:41 - place in my heart
51:42 - because it's not gonna work out if you
51:45 - want to do
51:46 - like this very small number of hours and
51:49 - then think you're going to succeed
51:50 - that's not going to happen
51:51 - because other software developers that
51:52 - are trying to learn they're going to
51:54 - keep putting in four or five hours
51:56 - and they're just going to beat you it
51:58 - doesn't matter even if you're smart
52:00 - or intelligent if somebody just keeps
52:02 - putting in more work than you on a
52:04 - regular basis
52:05 - they're just going to be better than you
52:06 - they're going to beat you you're going
52:07 - to go to an interview they're going to
52:08 - get the job
52:09 - and you're going to go home with the
52:12 - fact that you're like
52:13 - i had great work-life balance and i only
52:16 - did one hour of coding every day
52:18 - yeah no it's not gonna happen guys so
52:20 - like
52:21 - i don't discourage work-life balance i'm
52:23 - also not pro
52:24 - hustle you know just go crazy
52:28 - but i think that if you want to be great
52:31 - at something
52:32 - you do have to get a little obsessive at
52:34 - times and there's nothing wrong with
52:35 - that
52:36 - okay still sleep on time i still sleep
52:38 - and get my good sleep
52:40 - but every thought that comes out of my
52:42 - mind
52:43 - is about clever programmer is about how
52:45 - we can get you guys a better experience
52:47 - because let's be honest
52:48 - nobody else is doing events like these
52:50 - no all right and the reason why these
52:52 - are happening and why they're so good
52:54 - that we put together for you guys is
52:56 - because
52:57 - this is all we do and this is our entire
52:59 - focus and we're obsessed at 2 a.m
53:02 - i'm sending nas messages about how we
53:04 - can make it better
53:05 - or what we can do to better have better
53:07 - engagement with you guys
53:09 - even before this we were having
53:10 - arguments with like how can we actually
53:13 - give you guys video feedback on your
53:14 - freaking things and and we're like
53:16 - that's probably not going to be able to
53:17 - happen we have so many people i'm like
53:18 - let's
53:19 - we were like let's come up with a win
53:22 - it's obsession
53:23 - right it's like obsession to what you're
53:25 - trying to do that helps you get great
53:26 - results
53:27 - we're not a normal group of people we're
53:29 - not a work-life balanced group of people
53:32 - you know so our job here if you want to
53:35 - go
53:35 - be happy go to therapy
53:38 - it's brilliant but if you want to get
53:41 - good
53:42 - that's what we're here for we will do
53:44 - the work to make you happy too
53:46 - but we want to look at you like an
53:48 - engine you come to us how can we
53:49 - fine-tune you
53:50 - make you badass at software development
53:53 - and make you go get that job does that
53:55 - make sense
53:56 - that's what we're here for and
53:57 - especially in your younger years as you
53:59 - guys are starting
54:00 - this has been the best time to put as
54:02 - much time as possible as you're starting
54:04 - out
54:04 - inside development and i will tell you
54:07 - it's at some point it does get easier
54:09 - right and then maybe you will have more
54:10 - time for your family and stuff like that
54:12 - right
54:12 - um but yeah and yeah and don't let age
54:15 - be a barrier because wherever you start
54:18 - you will be completely
54:19 - good like yeah average age of a software
54:23 - developer when this
54:24 - start in us is like 34 or 37
54:27 - okay if you start later than that it
54:29 - doesn't mean you
54:30 - can't pick it up if you start earlier
54:32 - than that doesn't mean you can't pick it
54:33 - up
54:34 - jack ma decided to launch his business
54:36 - when he was like
54:37 - 50 and he created alibaba and it became
54:40 - a billion dollar business
54:41 - so we literally have students here in
54:44 - the you know in our boot camp in our
54:45 - community who are
54:46 - 49 55 years old and they're starting
54:49 - their first careers in top development
54:51 - and have already have gone jobs is
54:53 - pretty insane yes
54:55 - okay so don't let those things
54:57 - discourage you whether some people are
54:58 - like i'm too young or i'm too old
55:00 - i'm like no you're just looking for
55:01 - excuses okay
55:04 - you you can do this all right the only
55:06 - thing that's going to happen between you
55:07 - going from 60 years old to 61 is you're
55:10 - going to go from 60 to 61
55:11 - without being a software developer
55:13 - exactly or if you actually learn it you
55:16 - can be a software developer at 61 okay
55:19 - so it's doable just make sure
55:23 - the big butt there okay um
55:26 - is put in the work and it's doable
55:29 - okay it's not rocket science because i
55:32 - admit rocket science is pretty hard
55:34 - but software development is learnable a
55:37 - very
55:38 - very very learnable skill okay it just
55:40 - requires you to put in time and effort
55:42 - wait i just want to mention richard otis
55:43 - i love how you're watching this with
55:45 - your kid and just
55:46 - just you guys both are just smiling i
55:48 - love that
55:50 - that's actually great old-school shitty
55:53 - here
55:54 - [Laughter]
55:56 - okay so let's keep going
56:00 - all right now in terms of how do you
56:02 - learn to code there are many ways you
56:04 - guys can learn to code
56:05 - you know for example you guys are here
56:08 - at the event
56:10 - just make sure you go all in okay
56:12 - obsession
56:13 - in my opinion is really the only way to
56:15 - learn because
56:17 - the people that i see dilly dallying the
56:19 - mo the ones that it takes the longest
56:22 - to like do this in these weird hour
56:25 - blocks or some type of weird schedule
56:27 - type of thing
56:28 - just i know if you have family and you
56:30 - have all this you don't have the luxury
56:31 - to go for 10 hours or 15 hours
56:33 - but whatever time you have just put all
56:36 - of that in
56:37 - okay like look let me let me tell you
56:39 - guys this right
56:40 - you guys don't put instagram youtube and
56:43 - whatsapp and all of these apps
56:44 - on a calendar yet all of you find a way
56:47 - to spend 30 hours 30 minutes or an hour
56:50 - or two or three hours a day
56:52 - to use those apps on facebook or
56:55 - instagram anything else
56:56 - it's not on your calendar so with coding
56:59 - find a way where it's fun for you where
57:01 - it doesn't feel like pulling teeth where
57:03 - you don't have to put
57:04 - schedules and reminders make it so you
57:07 - immerse in it so what i would recommend
57:08 - is that when when you're in this boot
57:10 - camp
57:11 - everything you should be eating and
57:12 - breathing should be around coding
57:14 - you have free time and you want to relax
57:16 - great watch a documentary on
57:18 - um on linustor vaults okay
57:24 - he created linux oh okay that's cool
57:26 - awesome so like
57:28 - watch stuff around coding okay watch
57:30 - stuff around software development
57:32 - use that time to be entertained yet
57:35 - inspire yourself because look you can't
57:38 - just start eating broccoli right you can
57:40 - you can't go from like eating
57:42 - garbage food and candy to all of a
57:44 - sudden eating broccoli 24 7.
57:46 - but what you can do is you can trick
57:48 - yourself and eat
57:50 - healthier candy okay eat healthier ice
57:53 - cream
57:54 - which tastes just as good as the crappy
57:57 - ice cream
57:58 - all right so go watch entertaining
58:01 - videos that talk about coding and
58:02 - software development so you're excited
58:04 - about doing it
58:06 - so that's what i would recommend work on
58:09 - all the stuff that you have in here and
58:11 - then the rest of the time
58:12 - play with it watch videos watch content
58:14 - immerse yourself where
58:15 - this is your life this is the new you
58:18 - okay
58:19 - and if you're here break through
58:22 - like literally have almost an identity
58:24 - level change
58:25 - okay who here would be excited if you
58:28 - left and you're just you're
58:29 - loving software development who would be
58:31 - excited about that change in you and you
58:33 - created
58:34 - and you've created those amazing
58:35 - projects at this point and now you're
58:36 - gonna see where you the potential is
58:38 - guys
58:39 - yeah there's so much potential so much
58:42 - absolutely
58:43 - okay so that's really in my mind how you
58:45 - learn to code in a really
58:47 - fast amount of time okay if you put 30
58:49 - minute blocks
58:50 - you could do that for five years and
58:52 - you're gonna have a great
58:54 - thing going but you're not gonna be a
58:55 - great software developer okay so
58:57 - try to find ways where you could
58:59 - maximize it on each day
59:01 - and still get good sleep still get good
59:03 - food and still
59:04 - find a way i'm not asking you to
59:09 - kill yourself what i'm asking is use
59:10 - your time effectively i promise you
59:12 - there's two hours
59:14 - a day that are just being wasted into
59:16 - garbage
59:17 - if you focused that effectively on
59:19 - learning coding or doing some
59:21 - coding you wouldn't even need more time
59:24 - okay like
59:24 - how is elon musk running 20 different
59:27 - companies
59:28 - one launches rocket ships the other one
59:31 - is building a
59:32 - tunnel and like solving the traffic
59:34 - problem you know
59:36 - and then i don't know what other stuff
59:37 - that he's doing is crazy stuff
59:39 - he doesn't have more time than you or me
59:42 - no no no he's just being a lot more
59:43 - effective with his time
59:45 - and like and like and i want to give you
59:47 - guys a story guys like
59:49 - we have a student by the name of huda
59:50 - for example right and i'll
59:52 - get really good take this with two
59:53 - minutes right we have the student name
59:56 - huda she's in our booth camp
59:58 - and she lives in iran
60:01 - so for her actually you know the time
60:03 - for her for the coaching calls are very
60:05 - very late
60:06 - her coaching call time is 3 a.m in the
60:07 - morning but guess what
60:09 - it doesn't really matter for her because
60:11 - she still gets up at 3 in the morning
60:12 - she has three kids right she has a
60:14 - husband and and so forth
60:16 - she gets up at three a.m she learns with
60:19 - us literally for
60:20 - three hours per day from 3 a.m till
60:23 - about 6 a.m
60:24 - and after 6 a.m she gets up to then
60:27 - take her kids to school and after school
60:30 - after she leaves
60:31 - her kids at school then she comes back
60:33 - and then she also does homework and of
60:35 - course other things
60:36 - so right even though yes yes it's hard
60:39 - for her and yes she has to do this kind
60:41 - of stuff but
60:42 - the things that she already has done is
60:43 - amazing she's probably one of the
60:45 - hardest working people that i know just
60:46 - in general
60:48 - and so i want you guys to remember huda
60:49 - like when you think about any excuses
60:51 - that you might have
60:52 - and think about you know what i can
60:53 - learn this no matter what i have
60:56 - students who currently
60:57 - are doing truck driving anybody hear a
60:59 - truck driver by any chance
61:01 - anybody here truck driver anybody
61:04 - let me see in the chat if you guys are
61:07 - don't worry if you're not no worries
61:08 - but yeah for anybody who is a truck
61:10 - driver somebody said forklift driver
61:11 - yeah
61:12 - we have truck drivers who literally you
61:13 - know stop at truck stops
61:15 - just go ahead and learn with us it's
61:18 - crazy
61:18 - right it's all possible it's just you
61:20 - got to put the time into it that's it
61:23 - yeah absolutely yeah it's
61:26 - it's that that time component is really
61:30 - important
61:31 - and what i want to really emphasize is
61:35 - work hard to find that passion component
61:38 - because when you become passionate about
61:40 - it you just do this all the time like
61:42 - i don't need to think about clever
61:44 - programmer in time blocks and time
61:46 - portions because i love doing it my
61:48 - problem is the opposite of most people's
61:50 - problems people are like
61:51 - how do i stop procrastinating how do i
61:54 - you know put in the work how do i do all
61:56 - this
61:57 - my problem is the opposite my girlfriend
61:59 - can't it's hard for her to get me
62:01 - away from work like on a saturday or a
62:04 - sunday
62:05 - on my free day i just walked into nasa's
62:08 - office and i worked there
62:11 - this last sunday because i was like i
62:14 - was excited
62:14 - and and amberly she was like i think i'm
62:17 - gonna go do this other thing and i was
62:18 - sitting there i'm like what should i do
62:20 - i'm like i have the whole day to myself
62:22 - i'm gonna go to the office
62:24 - it's like the best thing i could do so
62:28 - find a way to build passion around it
62:31 - you know that's why i say
62:33 - be around the people that are in the
62:34 - community watch
62:36 - stuff around software development when
62:39 - you have that passion and excitement for
62:41 - it
62:41 - the rest of it becomes a lot easier you
62:43 - will just find a way to automatically
62:45 - put in the work
62:46 - agreed agreed okay now
62:49 - you know of course setting a goal for
62:51 - yourself is an important thing
62:52 - okay and and having realistic
62:54 - expectations so for example
62:57 - long-term goal for you would be hey i
62:59 - want to become a full-stack developer
63:01 - within the next
63:02 - one to five years that raise your hand
63:04 - that's your long-term goal here
63:07 - raising that's your long-term goal okay
63:09 - i like it
63:10 - if you have a if you have a different
63:11 - long-term goal let us know down and down
63:13 - the comments below
63:15 - yeah super curious yeah
63:19 - one to five years not too long
63:23 - so i'm saying we have steven says i'm in
63:25 - uh tutorial
63:26 - right now a lot of students are
63:30 - machine learning startup nice samir luna
63:32 - says i want to create something to
63:34 - better help the
63:35 - the foster care system wow that's
63:37 - awesome
63:39 - okay what's an sde software development
63:42 - something
63:42 - already sde software development
63:44 - engineering i don't know
63:46 - uh already a software development
63:47 - engineer got it yeah
63:50 - okay great so these are amazing goals
63:54 - that you guys are
63:55 - sharing yeah i think that realistically
63:58 - speaking you can become a pretty damn
63:59 - good developer within one to five years
64:01 - it takes a lot of work and if you really
64:05 - get committed you can definitely get a
64:07 - job within your first
64:09 - year so within the 12 months like for me
64:12 - i got my first job within the 12 months
64:15 - i had my first paying clients three
64:17 - months in
64:18 - and then six months in i had bigger
64:20 - paying clients
64:22 - i'm also obsessive and i was doing it
64:23 - like crazy but i think most people if
64:25 - you focus
64:26 - put in the hours you it's very possible
64:30 - for you
64:30 - to be able to get a job within your
64:32 - first 12 months
64:33 - okay and then short-term goal you know
64:36 - also understand what's your short-term
64:38 - goal so for example instead of learning
64:41 - five different types of things maybe
64:43 - make it
64:43 - something simple i want to just learn
64:46 - the fundamentals of javascript and then
64:49 - just go hard at that and master it okay
64:54 - so write it down maybe even have a
64:57 - timeline
64:57 - a rough timeline around it of what your
65:00 - goal is and what you're looking to do
65:02 - okay it could be even like build a to-do
65:04 - app by myself by next week
65:06 - yeah all right yeah so there could be
65:09 - those are some simple ideas for you
65:11 - maybe after you're done with this boot
65:12 - camp maybe your goal can be
65:14 - within two days after the boot camp
65:17 - build the rock paper scissors app
65:19 - or that sas product that i built but
65:20 - from scratch by yourself
65:22 - four days five days yeah yeah and one
65:25 - thing we'll encourage you guys as you
65:26 - guys go into this kind of stuff is
65:28 - you know within the rock paper scissors
65:29 - game any of these other projects that
65:31 - you guys are building with us
65:32 - is to always you know try to test things
65:36 - out by yourself and even add extra
65:37 - features
65:38 - right and then after this boot camp your
65:40 - goal should be one on the goal
65:42 - i never learn how to build this can i
65:45 - now build it by yourself by myself
65:46 - and that's it and literally do it that
65:48 - way because yeah
65:50 - i probably believe that raise your hand
65:54 - if you feel right now you feel like
65:57 - you're having a hard time building stuff
65:58 - by yourself
66:00 - like you're watching tutorials and you
66:02 - can do them yeah look at that look at
66:04 - everybody's hands go up
66:05 - yeah you're not the only ones guys we
66:08 - here at clever program we talk to a lot
66:10 - of students hundreds of students on a
66:11 - daily basis
66:13 - and it's the same situation every single
66:15 - time
66:16 - you guys are going to tutorials but yet
66:20 - you do not know how to build stuff fully
66:22 - by yourself
66:24 - so what needs to happen what needs to
66:26 - change
66:27 - what do you guys think let me know let
66:30 - us know in the comments below one is to
66:31 - change
66:32 - for you to change that habit for
66:33 - something for something to happen
66:35 - let me know
66:38 - but yeah we can continue on
66:42 - building things solo discipline small
66:46 - passion to get it done damn it nice yeah
66:49 - all right um so you know if you guys
66:52 - want to plan things
66:53 - and put them just one recommendation we
66:56 - have for you
66:57 - is if you guys you know i don't know if
66:58 - you guys know notion or not
67:00 - but if any of you guys familiar with
67:03 - notion just
67:04 - raise your hand slightly no all good all
67:07 - good
67:08 - so notion is a really just good
67:10 - productivity tool it's free
67:12 - and it helps you basically write down
67:15 - your plans put together timelines
67:17 - whatever you kind of want to do all in
67:18 - one place so
67:20 - give it a shot it works for some people
67:23 - and i
67:24 - i recommend you know if you need
67:26 - something that helps you with planning
67:27 - this could be a really good tool that
67:29 - you could use okay so give it a shot
67:31 - and maybe a notion you can have when
67:33 - you're planning to do
67:34 - what okay and put your learning plan
67:37 - in here might be a good idea to do that
67:42 - just gonna quickly lay out seven most
67:44 - important habits that we notice that
67:46 - people who succeed or
67:47 - students who succeed and go and get a
67:49 - job as a developer
67:51 - and we just wanted to lay them out for
67:54 - you
67:55 - here okay and some of them that i want
67:59 - to highlight out of all of these
68:01 - are um so i'm going to start off with
68:05 - just this for now okay so
68:08 - hard work and patience
68:11 - when i say hard work honestly i feel
68:13 - really guilty saying that because
68:16 - it's weird but i kind of you know just
68:19 - honest truth i feel like kind of suck at
68:21 - hard work
68:22 - nas is extremely good at hard work um
68:26 - because for me what it feels like i just
68:28 - get so obsessed that it doesn't
68:30 - feel like it doesn't feel like work
68:32 - anymore at all
68:33 - and it literally feels like i'm playing
68:35 - a game and then i can just go through it
68:37 - and and
68:38 - even if i have to do it obsessively or
68:39 - for long term to me it doesn't really
68:42 - feel like work when i do things
68:45 - um why is that why is that
68:49 - i think that
68:52 - when i went to school i developed a i
68:54 - went to this like weird school when i
68:56 - was young
68:57 - and i developed this thing where i um
69:01 - because they took a lot of things from
69:03 - you and they restricted a lot of things
69:05 - and it was very like
69:06 - it was really disciplinary and i
69:11 - started hating doing things that i hated
69:14 - like really like most people probably
69:16 - are like i'll just wash the dishes it
69:18 - doesn't feel that bad
69:19 - or i'll do this other thing it doesn't
69:20 - feel that bad for me i started
69:22 - hating things with the passion that
69:24 - didn't like so much that now when i do
69:26 - things that i don't like
69:27 - it like kills my soul from the inside it
69:29 - like burns
69:30 - wow so um it made me wanna really focus
69:35 - on things i enjoy doing
69:37 - and then within that i found that when
69:39 - something is really enjoyable for me and
69:41 - it's fun
69:42 - and i like it and it's aligned with me i
69:44 - can go through
69:45 - tremendous amount of work and it doesn't
69:48 - feel like i worked it's almost like i
69:50 - wake up from it and i'm like what the
69:51 - hell
69:52 - just happened what did i just do
69:53 - probably some of you might have
69:54 - experienced that
69:55 - yeah right like for example you'll leave
69:58 - that if you guys went to college
70:00 - and you or or you know maybe think back
70:03 - to when you were a student
70:04 - you left your final exam all the way
70:07 - until the last freaking day to study
70:09 - right who did that
70:10 - who did that here i sure as heck did it
70:17 - so but then all of a sudden you look
70:19 - back and you're like damn man that was
70:21 - sick
70:22 - i was like a superhuman how did i pull
70:24 - that off that was crazy
70:26 - so when you kind of are aligned and
70:29 - you're excited about things and you
70:30 - enjoyed them
70:31 - you know personally that's what it feels
70:33 - like for me but i just want to say that
70:35 - hard work and having patience is a key
70:38 - component okay
70:39 - so for me how i played it is i'll give
70:43 - you guys my
70:44 - workbook okay my recipe and nas laughs
70:47 - at me but i'm gonna share this with you
70:49 - but like for me patience is
70:52 - a really key thing and patience comes
70:54 - from expectation
70:56 - so when you have really high
70:58 - expectations you're really
71:00 - impatient with yourself you'll be really
71:02 - hard on yourself
71:03 - and also i think a lot of sense of loss
71:06 - great
71:07 - stems from having poor expectations all
71:10 - right
71:10 - so for example when i started coding i'm
71:12 - like in five years i'll have a job
71:15 - the first year i'm just supposed to suck
71:18 - not have a job constantly lose but i
71:22 - worked my ass off and i learned like
71:25 - crazy okay
71:26 - and then i'm like whatever happens
71:27 - happens if i get a job within the five
71:29 - years
71:30 - it's just a bonus so like in my mind
71:34 - i'm never losing i'm always winning
71:37 - every day
71:38 - even if i don't get a job for the five
71:40 - years i'm
71:41 - winning um even when i started clever
71:46 - programmer it started off like
71:48 - i i remember i got on a call with my
71:50 - friend tenzin and i'm like
71:51 - i want to fail the only thing i want to
71:53 - work on this year is
71:55 - fail 10 business ideas
71:58 - that's my only goal for this year work
72:01 - on 10 things that i'm going to fail
72:04 - and then i start a clever programmer and
72:07 - it succeeded and it became
72:08 - it became good um and it was like hey
72:12 - this is just a bonus this is this is
72:14 - great
72:14 - so why i'm sharing this with you guys is
72:16 - if you set your expectations right and
72:18 - you're not like i need a job within the
72:20 - next month
72:21 - you play that long game but you work
72:22 - your ass off now
72:24 - you'll also have this weird thing called
72:27 - happiness and peace along the way
72:29 - yeah okay see this is this is where i
72:31 - get a little bit even different
72:32 - sometimes you know
72:34 - because like for me this is where like
72:35 - kazi like we got these two different
72:37 - personalities in a way where
72:38 - kaizen like always looks like the worst
72:40 - case scenario you're not working but
72:41 - like always like
72:42 - you know what if i just get this i'll be
72:44 - fine right
72:46 - for me it's like i always said these
72:47 - crazy crazy things like guys i'm going
72:49 - to do this we're going to do this
72:51 - like for me if i was that position i'd
72:52 - be like okay i gotta have a job
72:54 - literally one year
72:55 - gotta get there you know like what can i
72:58 - do right
72:59 - but from that even so as
73:02 - as i've gotten older i realized how much
73:05 - of that
73:05 - is not so much important like yes that
73:08 - personality has gotten
73:09 - to where i am today right but i've also
73:12 - realized that
73:13 - that's not a necessity personality right
73:16 - like yes i want to push hard and go hard
73:18 - all the time and that's really good and
73:20 - that can really get you to a lot of
73:21 - places
73:22 - um at the same time you i kind of
73:24 - realized that i need to learn
73:27 - to almost kind of like step back and let
73:29 - things happen for you
73:31 - you know weirdly enough right and like
73:33 - instead of having this crazy
73:34 - expectations which i still sometimes do
73:36 - and i still like to push myself towards
73:38 - them
73:38 - i am a lot more relaxed knowing that you
73:40 - know what if i don't hit that
73:42 - somehow i know i'll hit it either later
73:44 - or some or something else might hit
73:46 - as well so i think that's the most
73:49 - important thing is i don't
73:50 - like bog myself down because that's what
73:52 - i used to do i used to literally punish
73:53 - myself for not
73:55 - knowing hey you know what oh i didn't
73:56 - get an a on this test or
73:58 - you know what i didn't do this or i
74:00 - don't have a job yet like what's going
74:02 - on with me
74:03 - yeah and that wasn't so pretty honestly
74:06 - so
74:07 - yeah now it does definitely change that
74:09 - though i'm still working on it
74:11 - yeah so just two perspectives from two
74:13 - different people take what you value
74:15 - throw away what isn't valuable for you
74:19 - um but i think that's kind of what i
74:21 - want to share from d7
74:23 - of course the other ones are important
74:24 - like taking initiative
74:26 - of course you have to be good at
74:28 - learning a lot because with development
74:29 - all those things change
74:31 - but you know this is this is the reason
74:33 - i see a lot of people
74:34 - quit having bad expectations
74:37 - and they go i'm gonna do two hours of
74:40 - coding
74:40 - and by the sixth month i'll have a job
74:43 - and then that leads to unhappiness and i
74:45 - see
74:46 - lots of people quit out of this career
74:48 - if you flip it it will
74:50 - make you really happy um and you will
74:53 - actually get through a lot of the crappy
74:55 - things that you need to get through
74:56 - okay so beautiful let's keep on going
75:00 - um so
75:04 - um yeah if you get angry and you're
75:06 - coding and things don't work sometimes
75:09 - there's one solution is to break your
75:11 - computer the second solution
75:13 - is to you know um which what i prefer
75:17 - when i'm playing chess
75:18 - is for me i will like actually go for a
75:21 - walk
75:22 - or other ones are all google and stack
75:24 - overflow
75:26 - which is actually what i do that's
75:27 - usually the best answer
75:30 - yeah so
75:33 - because yeah like start off
75:36 - of course when things don't work one of
75:38 - the things that i want to just tell you
75:39 - guys is you have to become
75:40 - ninjas at googling googling is yours
75:44 - going to be the way to solve problems
75:45 - it's your superpower
75:47 - yeah and you'll build a pattern
75:50 - recognition experience with
75:52 - how to understand the problems because
75:53 - for me for me it literally took a
75:55 - few years to be able to actually
75:57 - understand the answers that i would see
75:59 - on stack overflow like for the first
76:00 - couple of years
76:01 - with software development when i would
76:03 - see answers on stack overflow they would
76:04 - never make any sense to me and i'm like
76:06 - i don't understand how to
76:07 - fix this but just googling random things
76:11 - that would help me kind of start getting
76:13 - into the right place
76:15 - okay of course you can also ask your
76:17 - question
76:18 - but so let me just start with this
76:21 - google stack overflow
76:22 - but one thing i'd recommend is those two
76:25 - ways are generally what i consider
76:27 - lazy ways of thinking because you want
76:30 - somebody else
76:31 - you want to outsource your thinking to
76:32 - somebody else which i think is
76:34 - fine if you're an experienced software
76:35 - developer because you shouldn't have to
76:37 - think all the freaking time
76:39 - but i think when you're new use these as
76:42 - learning opportunities
76:43 - so before you go to other people and go
76:46 - hey daddy can you please help me lift
76:48 - this
76:48 - grocery bag or this weight it's too
76:50 - heavy for me
76:52 - i think stop and flex your own thinking
76:55 - muscles
76:56 - first okay do as far as possible right
77:00 - yes and we're not here trying to say
77:02 - that you know what you can't ask
77:04 - questions that's not what we're trying
77:05 - to say here at all
77:06 - instead what we're trying to say here is
77:08 - like hey just
77:09 - give yourself time to figure the
77:11 - solution yeah because crazy enough
77:14 - actually in the process of figuring out
77:16 - a solution
77:17 - is what where you learn the most
77:21 - like you go from one thing to another
77:22 - thing and what's gonna happen is you're
77:24 - building
77:24 - out patterns around coding right and
77:27 - after that for example let's say
77:29 - as you're researching you realize there
77:30 - was something else that you might have
77:31 - been missing the whole time
77:33 - like oh dang this is interesting yeah
77:35 - and so that's
77:36 - where really enough your brain is going
77:39 - to pick up more things
77:40 - than just by you coding
77:43 - because the thing is a lot of students
77:45 - that we have sometimes
77:47 - you guys potentially just you try to get
77:49 - the answer too fast
77:52 - yeah that's one thing that's another
77:54 - thing that comes with patience which is
77:56 - like
77:56 - you'll run into a problem and almost
77:59 - like you get some level of anxiety
78:01 - not knowing the answer and you want to
78:04 - get it
78:04 - really really really fast and so then
78:07 - you will go
78:08 - and ask that question to somebody or get
78:11 - on a call with somebody
78:14 - and you know this is going to sound
78:16 - weird but like i don't know if this is
78:18 - true i'm not a scientist and i haven't
78:19 - done research on this but i generally
78:21 - feel like
78:22 - people who ask too many questions
78:25 - generally don't do well in those
78:28 - particular industries
78:30 - and the reason why i say this is
78:34 - i think what's actually happening is
78:37 - either they're not designed for this
78:39 - industry and maybe
78:40 - something else might be better for them
78:41 - maybe they're more communic
78:43 - social people maybe they would be better
78:45 - working as a team manager for a software
78:48 - development company
78:49 - communicating with everybody but i think
78:52 - what they're what is happening there is
78:55 - they're outsourcing their thinking
78:57 - so they're being lazy thinkers okay
79:00 - and one thing you definitely have to
79:03 - make sure you get good at as a software
79:04 - developer is the more you put your
79:06 - thinking under tension just like being a
79:08 - bodybuilder right
79:11 - when you put your muscle under tension
79:13 - the longer you put it for under tension
79:14 - the more your muscle is gonna grow
79:16 - yep so with software development
79:20 - it's all about thinking it's not about
79:21 - you knowing tools
79:23 - it's not about you doing things quickly
79:25 - it's about your ability to think
79:27 - and the more time you could put your
79:29 - brain what's up
79:30 - think and problem solve i'm just gonna
79:32 - say yeah think and problem solve and the
79:34 - more time you can put your
79:36 - brain under tension your brain
79:39 - actually will physically expand okay
79:42 - brains physically expand when they
79:43 - actually do the
79:45 - brain analysis and like that they
79:47 - even found that the taxi drivers in uk
79:50 - because they have to memorize so much
79:53 - about how the roads and the traffic
79:55 - works they
79:56 - actually have bigger brains
79:59 - physically so it's a muscle
80:03 - but it takes time and those moments
80:06 - where you feel
80:06 - pain and you're like man i just want to
80:08 - know the answer i want to get to the
80:09 - answer
80:10 - under that stress is where you become a
80:13 - really strong software developer
80:16 - yeah because like i said it just like
80:17 - cause you're saying just repeat like
80:19 - yeah brain is a muscle it grows as you
80:22 - build it
80:23 - this is why and even in these situations
80:25 - right the most important here is not the
80:27 - fact that you're learning javascript
80:29 - the most important thing here is now
80:30 - you're learning html or css
80:32 - the most important thing that you're
80:34 - learning is problem solving and it's
80:36 - thinking
80:36 - when you have a bug in front of you and
80:38 - you can't solve it
80:40 - or it's when you have a feature to build
80:42 - and you really just don't know
80:43 - how to go about it it's like you're
80:46 - trying to figure it out
80:47 - this is where you're building that brain
80:49 - so we want you guys to encourage that
80:51 - these next five days
80:53 - we encourage you literally challenge
80:56 - yourself
80:57 - as much as possible and you will find
81:00 - some amazing amazing results from that
81:03 - yeah
81:04 - and let me tell you something where your
81:05 - brain will try to trick you
81:08 - when you get stuck in a problem your
81:10 - brain will tell you
81:12 - and your brain is completely blank okay
81:14 - so i think you guys might have
81:15 - experienced that right where you run
81:16 - into
81:17 - has that ever happened to you guys where
81:18 - you guys run into a problem and then
81:20 - you're trying to think of a solution
81:21 - your brain is literally blank
81:23 - yeah colors are blocking your child said
81:25 - green right colors like you're like hey
81:28 - i'm literally not making any progress so
81:30 - your brain will actually trick you and
81:32 - your brain will say
81:33 - neo you're not making any progress
81:36 - so why don't you just look up the answer
81:38 - because you're not making any progress
81:39 - anyway
81:40 - and that's a trap that's a trap
81:44 - because your brain wants to survive
81:46 - because it knows if it thinks more it's
81:48 - more work
81:49 - your body doesn't want to do more work
81:51 - your body just wants to survive for a
81:53 - longer period of time another day
81:55 - you're still a biological creature that
81:57 - that has a primary function of survival
82:00 - so your brain will literally try not to
82:02 - do work and trick you like
82:03 - you know like you don't need to think
82:05 - about this there's google
82:08 - ah somebody has the answer it's like a
82:10 - crack addict that just needs another
82:11 - like fix
82:12 - so what you need to do at that point is
82:15 - ignore that voice of your brain
82:17 - and just chill like go go for a walk the
82:20 - tricky thing is sometimes at least for
82:21 - my brain
82:22 - i'll spend 30 minutes or 40 minutes and
82:24 - i have made no forward progress
82:26 - and then all of a sudden things starts
82:28 - clicking in a weird way yeah so
82:31 - i think sometimes that part is important
82:33 - like to not look at the answer and just
82:35 - get in the flow of it even if it takes
82:36 - you four hours of being
82:38 - unproductive it's going to actually help
82:41 - you at the end of the day
82:42 - yeah really enough yeah um
82:45 - all right because like there's some
82:46 - people who are like nas and this guy's
82:49 - either developed a really strong system
82:51 - for problem solving or probably is a
82:52 - little gifted as well
82:54 - but like he immediately's brain is like
82:56 - thinking of the way to solve the problem
82:58 - and he'll like start breaking it down
83:00 - for me my brain will be blank for like
83:02 - 30 minutes to an hour
83:04 - and then things will start coming in and
83:07 - then i'm like all right here we go
83:10 - it takes me time you know
83:13 - okay cool so full stack developer
83:17 - there are a lot of things that means
83:19 - it's a big term
83:21 - but generally what what what's happening
83:24 - is is these three things here
83:27 - okay other things can be of course a
83:29 - part of it too
83:30 - let me clear this and let me just draw
83:31 - with my other one okay but it's these
83:34 - three things here so when you
83:35 - when you hear full stack developer i
83:37 - want you to think
83:38 - front end back end database
83:42 - okay and database generally i even
83:44 - consider database to be
83:45 - part of back end okay so really when you
83:48 - when you hear a full stack i just want
83:49 - you to think front end and back end
83:50 - that's all okay these are the only two
83:52 - things i want you to think about
83:54 - all right when i when i say front end
83:56 - it's
83:57 - clicking but all the stuff that looks
84:00 - pretty and does stuff that you see with
84:01 - your eyes
84:02 - it's the view one what's up it's the
84:04 - view guys it's what you see on facebook
84:06 - what you see on instagram when you go on
84:07 - there
84:08 - it's what you're seeing right here right
84:09 - when you're on youtube or you're on zoom
84:11 - it's coaches yes yeah the user interface
84:15 - and all of that so for example what nas
84:17 - is saying is
84:18 - they could have had the videos in like
84:20 - excel type of thing
84:22 - where when you type in a search it's
84:23 - just an excel document
84:25 - with the list of videos right and you
84:27 - read the names and you click on the one
84:29 - that you like
84:31 - but then they decided hey instead of
84:34 - showing the view
84:35 - in that way how about actually we show
84:37 - thumbnails of the video in a way where
84:39 - it looks more clickable and friendly
84:41 - yeah would you would you guys agree
84:42 - that'd be that that's a lot better
84:45 - is that better or not yeah yeah
84:48 - so the ui okay and the design that's
84:51 - more front-end
84:52 - when when we talk about back-end it's
84:54 - more about for example
84:56 - how exactly is youtube able to handle
85:00 - billion gigabytes of new storage that's
85:04 - being uploaded to their website
85:05 - yeah that's interesting right yeah
85:07 - because your google drive can't do that
85:09 - no right where where am i going to store
85:12 - it like
85:12 - if i gave you okay if i gave you
85:16 - a billion gigabytes of footage
85:20 - where exactly are you going to store it
85:22 - what would you do with it
85:23 - like i'm just curious someone said the
85:26 - cloud
85:28 - where would you go with that well it'd
85:31 - be crazy
85:32 - right and if you um so that's just a
85:35 - simple
85:36 - example then what if you have a million
85:38 - people streaming
85:39 - what if you have one person streaming at
85:41 - a time okay you solve that that's great
85:43 - but if you have 100 people streaming at
85:44 - the same time
85:45 - you solve that that's great what if you
85:47 - have a billion people streaming at the
85:49 - same time
85:50 - ooh that's an interesting problem so
85:54 - back end okay
85:57 - that's that stuff is back in and it's
85:59 - equally if not more important
86:01 - yeah it's kind of what it's the things
86:03 - you don't see that's the hard work right
86:05 - uh you know when you for example log
86:07 - into facebook guys right and
86:08 - you put in your username username and
86:10 - password where do you think that
86:12 - username password goes to
86:14 - what do you guys think well a database
86:16 - it goes to database it goes to the
86:18 - backend right it goes to an api that
86:19 - they have
86:20 - right then the api checks the back end
86:23 - says hey is this guy real or not
86:25 - if he's not he's like oh no this guy's
86:27 - not real right it's a thormann error
86:29 - but if he's real okay all right let's go
86:32 - ahead and log him in
86:32 - and actually showcase watch and then
86:34 - give him all the information about
86:36 - himself
86:37 - who here knows about popular ugly
86:39 - websites
86:41 - does anybody here know any popular ugly
86:43 - websites let us know in the comments i'm
86:45 - curious
86:46 - well there used to be reddit
86:51 - there's craigslist and craigslist right
86:56 - but even even reddit has changed their
86:58 - ui now
86:59 - [Music]
87:02 - okay and i think craigslist might soon
87:05 - or maybe it's just craigslist i really
87:07 - doubt
87:08 - i really thought they're gonna change
87:09 - anything yeah that might that might
87:11 - never change there
87:12 - yeah so not many websites are gonna
87:15 - continue to be
87:16 - that ugly okay but i'm sure they have
87:18 - really good back ends
87:19 - but they don't have a good front end
87:21 - okay and now they're working on their
87:22 - front end as well because they're
87:23 - losing viewers and users and they're
87:25 - like okay let's do this okay
87:28 - all right um in terms of
87:32 - somebody saying no okay i'll go go good
87:35 - okay okay cool
87:36 - so in terms of technologies you guys
87:37 - need to learn okay
87:39 - um you'll need to know html you'll need
87:41 - to know css okay this is
87:43 - this right here is html this is css
87:47 - and javascript okay so these three
87:50 - if there's something for you guys to
87:51 - focus on this is what i would focus on
87:53 - for a while pick up
87:56 - react later but just keep in mind react
87:59 - is a baby of javascript
88:01 - okay javascript is the dad react is the
88:03 - baby
88:04 - so learn these first
88:07 - and then react is going to be easier
88:13 - cool and then you can also learn a
88:16 - firebase which is a database
88:20 - okay and that's where you can actually
88:22 - store
88:23 - stuff so that's going to be helpful when
88:25 - you're making apps where
88:27 - you have other users that can log in log
88:29 - out you have user authentication
88:32 - um things like that okay yeah i want to
88:35 - launch a poll here guys
88:36 - which one would you want to do front end
88:38 - backend or full stack
88:40 - i'm really curious here
88:43 - let me know that's so cool i love the
88:46 - poll
88:47 - yeah damn we have 200 and
88:51 - almost we have 300 people just answered
88:53 - the poll right now
88:54 - that's pretty fast like guys even this
88:58 - whole poll right if you think about it
89:00 - which portion is the view of the front
89:02 - end which portion is the front end right
89:04 - which person's the front end
89:07 - well it's what is the u actually seen
89:09 - right the question and you've been able
89:11 - to answer it
89:12 - and then which portion is the back end
89:16 - it's which one where where the poll is
89:18 - being stored
89:19 - well yes the poll being stored and where
89:21 - you you guys are actually being
89:23 - being able to when you answer the poll
89:25 - it's storing your answer in the database
89:27 - that's it
89:31 - wow we almost got 400 responses yeah
89:34 - that
89:34 - is phenomenal to the poll so yeah so it
89:36 - looks like 290 of you said you want to
89:38 - become full stack developers
89:40 - okay we're sharing the results now 36
89:44 - said you
89:44 - you know nine percent says back end 19
89:47 - said front end and 73
89:48 - of you said full stack development so
89:52 - you know um with full stack you know
89:55 - both front end and back end
89:56 - and what's amazing about that is that it
89:58 - makes you really
89:59 - uh valuable at your company which means
90:04 - you're probably going to be if if this
90:06 - happened god forbid this happens but
90:08 - you're going to be the last person
90:09 - that's fired
90:11 - because you're needed you're like needed
90:13 - needed
90:14 - right um just because it makes you so
90:18 - versatile all right
90:20 - but both of these other options if you
90:22 - chose front end and back end they're not
90:23 - wrong either they're great and there are
90:25 - plenty of people making a lot of money
90:26 - doing either of those okay so
90:28 - both of those are valuable awesome
90:30 - thanks for sharing guys
90:32 - now html css and javascript here's how
90:35 - you guys should think about it right
90:36 - html
90:38 - is just a skeleton okay
90:41 - html is pretty much when you like
90:45 - when you don't have any clothes on
90:46 - you're just this html structure
90:49 - all right it's like your bones basically
90:52 - yeah css is when you put on makeup when
90:56 - you put on clothes
90:58 - when you get ready right that's your
91:00 - that's the style like
91:02 - that i look good
91:05 - exactly so when you go to a website that
91:07 - doesn't have css
91:09 - those websites are absolutely hideous
91:12 - okay unlike you you're beautiful even
91:14 - with
91:14 - but no makeup on anything because you're
91:16 - here and we love you
91:18 - [Laughter]
91:19 - don't let anybody else tell you
91:20 - otherwise
91:23 - but for but for um websites
91:27 - when they don't have css they are
91:30 - they're awful to look at they're not
91:31 - pleasant
91:32 - you guys know what i'm talking about
91:33 - those css like or those uh
91:35 - you guys have seen like these university
91:37 - professors always post homework
91:39 - and it's always on like these ugliest
91:42 - websites you've
91:42 - ever seen um that's just with html okay
91:46 - and then javascript adds
91:50 - action to the thing it has the funkiness
91:52 - the funkiness of you being able to dance
91:54 - and the
91:55 - you know to think and to do all these
91:57 - other different things
91:59 - that's right so like when you actually
92:02 - click a button
92:02 - what happens you know how does a video
92:05 - load
92:06 - oh when i'm on youtube and i hit that
92:07 - thumbs up button it turns
92:09 - blue interesting okay those are all
92:13 - things happening with javascript
92:16 - cool so html is basically if you guys
92:20 - want to write this down as well
92:21 - if you know it that's that's great but
92:24 - this is what makes a page work it's the
92:26 - structure of a page
92:27 - okay this is what really bare bone html
92:31 - looks like
92:32 - and this html if you wrote this you
92:35 - would have a page or a website that's
92:37 - actually running or doing something
92:39 - okay uh one good place i recommend you
92:43 - guys go to if you want to just write
92:45 - random code and have fun stack blitz is
92:48 - a phenomenal resource
92:50 - and you can go here and do stuff so i'm
92:52 - gonna i'm just gonna choose
92:54 - i'm gonna go to stack blitz and i'm just
92:56 - gonna choose html javascript css
92:59 - boom right there you guys can see my
93:02 - screen
93:04 - cool so i'm just gonna choose index.html
93:07 - here
93:09 - all right that'd be great
93:12 - what's up if you can zoom in on that
93:13 - that'll be great
93:15 - oh just comment there we go nice
93:19 - okay great so i'm here right

93:28 - alone so
93:30 - let's just say i write a h2 and i say
93:32 - hello ron all of a sudden i have hello
93:37 - ron
93:38 - mm-hmm okay uh let's go now which
93:41 - portion is that guys what he's doing
93:42 - right now which portion is that
93:44 - let us know in the comments below which
93:45 - i don't know what that question means
93:47 - as an is this is this the html the css
93:50 - or is the javascript
93:51 - ah okay got it yeah
93:55 - so yeah which one is this am i working
93:57 - what am i working on here
93:59 - beautiful everybody's saying html
94:00 - exactly nice
94:02 - wow good smart crowd i love it thank you
94:05 - guys
94:06 - so yeah this is the html portion right
94:08 - and now if i make it
94:10 - h6 it'll become much smaller
94:14 - okay now if i was to change the color of
94:16 - this
94:18 - uh that would be what portion if i just
94:21 - asked you guys right now if i was to
94:22 - change the color of hello charles
94:24 - to to something else green
94:27 - some good answers out here good nice to
94:30 - have david nice css
94:32 - exactly that would be the styling good
94:33 - job so at a very basic level
94:36 - that's effectively what's happening okay
94:39 - so let's keep going on with our
94:41 - presentation and remember you can use
94:42 - the stack blitz resource it's awesome
94:44 - it's free
94:45 - it's epic gets you up and running super
94:47 - quick
94:48 - all right css you can use you can learn
94:51 - how to use different layouts
94:52 - flexbox responsive design media query so
94:55 - for example
94:57 - when i go on youtube these guys might
94:59 - actually be using flexbox
95:01 - to show their videos in a specific way
95:05 - okay so like for example the first row
95:08 - has
95:10 - three four five six videos right the
95:12 - next row also has six videos
95:15 - in this row essex they might be using
95:16 - flexbox to
95:18 - uh display it where there's like this
95:20 - little gap in between
95:22 - these videos here um it's laid out in
95:26 - this
95:26 - perfect like line here like this right a
95:29 - row
95:30 - so that's an example of flexbox
95:34 - let's go
95:38 - cool let's keep going and and by the way
95:40 - now if you ever want to show something
95:42 - to just let me know i can i'll stop my
95:43 - screen sure and you can do it too okay
95:45 - i'll keep going that's all good
95:47 - so let's go so and this is what css
95:50 - looks like so css will look like this
95:52 - where you're styling things you're
95:55 - targeting a certain
95:56 - block you're giving it a certain color
95:58 - okay
95:59 - so for example if we go back to this
96:02 - let's see maybe i can go to my style css
96:05 - let's look at this one right this is h6
96:08 - so maybe i can go here and go
96:11 - hey also h6
96:14 - save cool and can i give it
96:18 - um let's see if i give it a different
96:22 - color
96:23 - all of a sudden it's all green okay
96:26 - so it's really simple how it allows you
96:29 - to be able to play with it and
96:31 - you know change things
96:35 - cool and of course you can get more
96:37 - complex with it and do fancier things
96:38 - with it right here you have hover oh
96:40 - i could point on it and then it turns
96:42 - red fancy okay
96:45 - when it comes to go ahead now you want
96:47 - to talk about this so what do you need
96:48 - to know when you learn javascript
96:50 - yeah so for jaw so click on that again
96:52 - so the javascript comes up
96:53 - i think nice awesome so for the
96:57 - javascript portion guys
96:58 - what we really want to focus on is not
97:00 - so much just done
97:01 - basically learning a lot of complex
97:03 - things instead we want to focus on
97:05 - on learning the basic things right so
97:08 - for example here what we got is data
97:09 - types so one of the things right
97:11 - so guys what are the what are some data
97:12 - data types do we have let me know in the
97:14 - comments below
97:15 - well what do we know we know there's
97:17 - like variables
97:18 - right there's like you know an integer
97:20 - there's strings
97:21 - right there's objects there's arrays
97:23 - there's booleans
97:25 - all those are data types it's kind of
97:27 - like you need to know how to use them
97:29 - because
97:29 - you know each one provides you with a
97:31 - different solution
97:32 - each one allows you to do different
97:34 - things right
97:36 - if you want to have a data type for
97:37 - example hey is this user logged in or
97:40 - not
97:41 - what kind of data data type would you
97:42 - use oh that's a good one
97:44 - huh yeah yeah that's a that's a good one
97:47 - which one would you guys
97:48 - use if the user is logged in or not
97:50 - there's some good answers yeah
97:51 - like kind of like victor said yeah you
97:53 - use a boolean
97:55 - right what did which did the type would
97:57 - you use for example if you wanted to
97:59 - um have a list of for example names
98:03 - right and you want to be able to list
98:04 - them out
98:05 - what data would you use yeah correct and
98:08 - array
98:09 - right or what data would you use to for
98:11 - example to describe a user
98:13 - describe the use that's currently logged
98:15 - into facebook
98:17 - what data would you use yeah that's
98:19 - right exactly like an object right so
98:21 - this is where you guys need to learn all
98:23 - these different things so you can
98:24 - properly
98:25 - use them because sometimes when i talk
98:27 - to students you guys have no idea what
98:29 - that is instead you just kind of like
98:31 - oh yeah i get i get i get it you know
98:34 - here is his hand
98:37 - right yeah yeah i get it now they exist
98:39 - but like and which points i use it well
98:41 - you got to know when to use them
98:42 - next thing is of course functions es6
98:45 - and us7
98:46 - so with functions what's a function guys
98:49 - who knows what a function is anybody
98:52 - what's a function hector knows
98:56 - well a function is basically
98:59 - something that allows you to take a
99:00 - piece of your piece of code
99:02 - right and to store it and basically
99:05 - to create a reusable piece of code so
99:08 - for example
99:09 - let's say i have a piece of code for
99:10 - logging for logging you in right
99:12 - facebook has a piece of code for logging
99:14 - you in whenever you click the login
99:16 - button
99:17 - what do you think it will call what
99:20 - function
99:21 - what function the login function exactly
99:25 - let's say you guys want to go
99:27 - let's say let's talk take me for example
99:29 - as a person
99:31 - i want to go for a run what internal
99:34 - tools inside me is a person do i have
99:37 - to go for a run and what do i activate
99:40 - right what is it your legs
99:43 - right your arms all your muscles it's
99:45 - like it's like almost like a reusable
99:47 - function right
99:48 - do you know exactly what you need to
99:49 - activate in order to go for a run
99:52 - it's the same thing here next up
99:56 - dom manipulation now dom manipulation is
99:59 - very interesting because
100:01 - what do you see on there right in terms
100:03 - of a landing page when you
100:04 - go on any website let's say google.com
100:07 - or
100:08 - facebook.com you see a page right
100:12 - but what happens when you for example
100:16 - what happens when you for example a new
100:18 - post gets
100:19 - gets picked up right what happens then
100:22 - or for example you're on youtube right
100:23 - now right
100:24 - and let's just say that you right now
100:27 - for example
100:28 - you go to let's see subscriptions or
100:30 - originals let's say you click on
100:31 - originals
100:33 - click on originals there we go so you
100:36 - can see
100:37 - the left side bar stayed the same right
100:40 - while the right
100:41 - section of this page changed
100:44 - that's funny
100:48 - so what happened was basically we
100:51 - manipulate the dom
100:52 - which is the document object model which
100:55 - is what the page is it's the structure
100:56 - of the page
100:58 - and you said basically when you clicked
101:00 - on originals what do we say
101:01 - hey you know what the left sidebar stays
101:04 - the same we don't change the left
101:05 - sidebar look
101:06 - but the right section of the sidebar
101:08 - changes the content
101:10 - that's called down manipulation next up
101:13 - is going to be what scope so scope i
101:15 - won't go too much deeper but scope is
101:17 - basically where what
101:18 - scope is like kind of like um
101:21 - you have an access to something only
101:24 - within certain parts of the application
101:27 - right for example your password
101:30 - would you want your application to have
101:32 - access that password or no
101:35 - probably not because of safety reasons
101:38 - yeah
101:38 - probably not so we give your password
101:41 - only access to certain parts of the
101:43 - application potentially
101:44 - right that's scope next thing data
101:47 - structures
101:48 - data structures are freaking cool
101:50 - because a lot of people go
101:52 - ah boring but when you think about the
101:55 - boring company by elon musk
101:57 - that is using tons okay
102:01 - so also when you go on google
102:05 - that search engine is using data
102:06 - structures and algorithms if i told you
102:08 - for you know make a search engine you
102:11 - would need to use data structures and
102:12 - algorithms
102:14 - a lot of times there's binary trees
102:17 - there's stacks there's cues
102:19 - there's linked lists and the sad part
102:22 - about you guys
102:23 - or about a lot of students is they don't
102:25 - know what those are
102:27 - yeah they escape through them and in
102:30 - order for you guys because because
102:31 - everything else sounds fancier and much
102:33 - more
102:34 - fun you know this is like eating

104:23 - all right cool so this is where we're at
104:25 - right now right you guys are of course
104:27 - and this is an example of course of
104:29 - javascript as we see right now right
104:31 - what we have right now is
104:32 - we have this right here is what this is
104:35 - an object or this is actually an array
104:37 - right and then this right here is what
104:39 - this is an object right here this
104:40 - section okay
104:42 - all right and of course this right here
104:43 - is kind of like a filter function that
104:45 - that's being used
104:46 - right that's javascript so
104:49 - so what do we have here okay let's talk
104:52 - about some frameworks
104:53 - because javascript and html and css oh
104:57 - great they're kind of like the bare
104:59 - bones right it's kind of like
105:00 - when you're building a house guys what
105:02 - do you build first
105:04 - what do you build first what do you
105:05 - build first tell me what do you guys
105:06 - think in the
105:07 - given tell me the chat where it gets
105:08 - built first in terms of house
105:11 - the foundation correct and so really the
105:14 - javascript html the css what those are
105:16 - is those are just simply the foundations
105:18 - right but we need to build stuff on top
105:21 - of that for that
105:22 - for you to be fully useful this is where
105:25 - we go get into frameworks this is
105:27 - something that we'll explain here in
105:29 - this specific presentation okay
105:32 - well the most on the popular frameworks
105:34 - we have here are number one
105:35 - angular anybody know angler here raise
105:37 - your hand
105:39 - yeah good good good okay okay
105:42 - that's one next one we know is called
105:45 - view
105:46 - anybody know what view is ujs
105:49 - beautiful beautiful and then the third
105:52 - one we got
105:53 - is react and this one is tom tom tom
105:56 - this one is the best one or that that's
105:57 - the one that we like the most
105:59 - [Laughter]
106:00 - right now you might be asking yourself a
106:02 - question of like
106:04 - why is react so cool why react in
106:07 - general
106:08 - both of these frameworks are really good
106:11 - both are amazing right in terms of what
106:13 - they do and what they allow you to do
106:16 - the thing however is that we've realized
106:18 - is that look at the companies are
106:19 - currently using all these different
106:20 - frameworks so
106:21 - what do we have react.js right used by
106:24 - airbnb
106:25 - by instagram uber eats you know dropbox
106:28 - you know and so forth angularjs upwork
106:32 - paypal sony right so still pretty
106:35 - very much useful am i right correct
106:39 - however what should you i choose
106:43 - which one would you choose guys let me
106:45 - know in the comments
106:46 - in the in the zoom chat below i'm very
106:48 - curious which one would you choose
106:50 - react react react angular react react
106:53 - holy moly
106:55 - dang okay okay i like it i like it i
106:57 - like him
106:58 - a lot of react people so
107:01 - the reason why we just say react is
107:03 - because why this really is called a
107:05 - stack overflow survey that stack gorflow
107:07 - does
107:07 - every single year and
107:10 - they found out that react.js is one of
107:13 - the top
107:14 - ones out there right it's being used by
107:17 - a lot
107:18 - a lot of companies you know year in and
107:21 - year out
107:23 - you know it's a v and it's a really
107:25 - enough it's actually a lot more
107:26 - efficient
107:26 - and real life is actually it's a lot
107:28 - more faster than any of these other
107:29 - frameworks
107:31 - and it's because this is called a
107:33 - library while this is called a framework
107:36 - anybody anybody know the difference
107:38 - between a library and a framework here
107:39 - who knows
107:41 - anybody spelling victor says
107:45 - that's funny
107:48 - that's i mean that's pretty good so
107:51 - framework versus a library
107:56 - which one so library is a collection of
108:00 - tools
108:00 - chanda says embedded with frameworks
108:03 - okay
108:04 - a firmware has certain user
108:05 - specifications somebody says
108:07 - what else library connection collection
108:10 - of code library
108:11 - so good question so a library
108:14 - is basically a library is more bare
108:16 - bones so
108:18 - a bare bones built built
108:21 - built on bare bones javascript
108:27 - and and it gives right and it gives you
108:30 - a lot
108:32 - gives you a lot of basically
108:35 - room to play
108:38 - so it's a lot very flexible what does
108:40 - that mean basically
108:42 - it's using very much javascript
108:43 - underneath the hood yes
108:46 - but it's really built on javascript
108:48 - versus
108:49 - angular is basically you are limited
108:54 - limited to functionalities
108:57 - that it has
109:02 - functionalities that it has it's kind of
109:04 - like
109:05 - it's kind of like the mac os system or
109:07 - the you know the windows system right
109:09 - we're limited to the functionality that
109:11 - this has right so that's kind of where
109:13 - our frame will really come in right
109:15 - we're very limited but by what
109:17 - functionalities
109:18 - those mac os system and they give us you
109:20 - guys understand that yes or no raise
109:21 - your hand with me
109:23 - right versus a library it's almost kind
109:25 - of like linux more so i would say it's
109:27 - got the closest one it's like linux
109:29 - a library is where you can actually
109:31 - build things on top of it
109:33 - you can build other things on top of
109:35 - react gs
109:37 - because it's using more more bare bones
109:39 - right
109:40 - so this is where uh react.js is actually
109:42 - kind of winning because it's very much
109:44 - bare bones and so it's a lot more
109:45 - efficient
109:46 - and look at that here's some downloads
109:48 - per year some more data for you
109:50 - on the downloads per year section you
109:51 - can see for example react is very much
109:53 - going up up and up and up the whole time
109:55 - look at that
109:56 - it's pretty cool hey so that means that
109:59 - react for the win all right
110:02 - so top ten companies using javascript of
110:04 - course we got linkedin
110:06 - very important company we got facebook
110:08 - we got microsoft we got ebay
110:10 - tesla groupon netflix

122:07 - kind of like
122:08 - you guys will see me doing like a push
122:10 - and a pull you guys will see me
122:12 - committing things so but i won't be
122:14 - forcing you guys so much into learning
122:15 - get so much focus on more so on like the
122:18 - javascript side the html side and the
122:20 - windows projects okay
122:21 - awesome thank you so much you got it
122:24 - awesome any more questions
122:27 - let's see who else we got who else gavin
122:30 - go ahead my friend
122:35 - i just had a question um about um when
122:38 - you say launch do you mean using netlify
122:40 - or heroku yeah yeah you can you get you
122:43 - could you can use nullify heroic
122:45 - creators just can
122:46 - put your project live okay for us to see
122:48 - and that's pretty much it
122:50 - and then um for the project section do
122:52 - you just want us to leave it blank
122:53 - or if for some of us that don't have
122:56 - projects
122:57 - yeah if you don't have projects feel
122:58 - free just leave a blank honestly if you
123:00 - don't have any projects
123:01 - yeah don't worry yeah if you don't you
123:03 - probably just leave it blank okay
123:05 - but the other the other skill sets you
123:06 - can use you can you can just put on
123:08 - there you know
123:09 - and i mean yes at the end of this
123:11 - basically you will be able to put your
123:13 - three brothers that you will build
123:14 - so at the end of all this and then
123:16 - you'll be able to put the actual
123:17 - projects you know
123:18 - uh that will be building this five-day
123:20 - bootcamp understand
123:22 - got it awesome sweet cool cool any more
123:25 - questions let me see who else
123:26 - ron how are you doing my friend
123:30 - let me see ron
123:36 - let me see well yeah go ahead hi ron
123:39 - hey how you doing um
123:42 - you know this is my first time like
123:45 - entering into uh
123:47 - software programming and okay now it's
123:50 - uh
123:51 - i know with the projects everything's
123:52 - coming and there some people here
123:54 - know a little bit what to do you know um
123:58 - based on the project and the homework
124:00 - that we're gonna do the html is like
124:02 - would you
124:02 - recommend us uh you know
124:06 - going over the videos first before you
124:07 - go and
124:09 - start tackling on that homework yeah i
124:11 - mean
124:12 - i mean uh you mean like the portfolio
124:14 - homework is that what you're talking
124:15 - about
124:16 - right yeah because we have to like uh
124:18 - change it up do something because i'm
124:20 - i'm like all ready to go and do this
124:22 - that's awesome i love it i love
124:24 - it honestly i think just just kind of
124:26 - throw yourself into it
124:27 - perish like like really enough what's
124:29 - gonna happen is that when you throw
124:31 - yourself
124:31 - into it and you just kind of like um
124:34 - you know you kind of see things and you
124:36 - see challenges in front of you you're
124:38 - going to work
124:38 - backwards you know what i mean so you're
124:40 - going to see oh oh dang okay how do i
124:42 - start
124:42 - to start up this project well then
124:44 - you're going to go on google
124:46 - search up how do i start this project
124:48 - and then you get the answers so you'll
124:50 - be working backwards biscuit the whole
124:51 - time
124:52 - like doing like reverse engineering
124:54 - exactly exactly which is the fun part of
124:56 - it
124:56 - uh just in general as well yeah yeah i'm
124:59 - i'm an industrial designer by trade
125:01 - okay sorry a lot of little manufacturing
125:03 - portion so i
125:04 - i know what you're saying like you know
125:05 - thinking backwards and going sideways
125:08 - that's cool and so and so why you want
125:09 - to get into coding is that right
125:11 - yeah definitely that's awesome that's
125:13 - awesome and so like have you
125:15 - got us on community and things like that
125:18 - um
125:19 - say that again have you put yourself on
125:21 - the community are you in our community
125:22 - yeah yeah yeah i'm already part of it
125:25 - yeah beautiful beautiful
125:26 - cool cool yeah yeah cause i i started
125:28 - going doing
125:29 - the entering in the route of a software
125:34 - qa
125:34 - mm-hmm the engineering so like doing
125:36 - more of the
125:37 - end away and then even working my way up
125:40 - to going to do
125:41 - being developing you know nice so
125:44 - that's like probably the next round so
125:46 - wait i'm curious why switch why
125:48 - why why the whole switch i'm just
125:49 - curious um
125:52 - industrial design i mean this is uh
125:56 - i love it but at the same time it's like
125:58 - you know i feel like
125:59 - i'm not doing a lot of good and creating
126:02 - things so like i want to do something
126:04 - like i
126:04 - that's going to last put my stamp on it
126:07 - like really hard you know
126:10 - i feel like you know with with the
126:11 - software like i could create something
126:13 - new and
126:15 - it's going to go like it's going to go
126:16 - viral or just stay static or i'll be
126:18 - able to help out
126:19 - yeah be better you know so that's
126:22 - honestly the best part to all of you
126:24 - guys the best part about coin that i
126:25 - personally find is like
126:27 - it's like basically like the way i think
126:29 - of ourselves as developers is literally
126:32 - inventors
126:33 - like i think of us as inventors i'm not
126:35 - gonna lie you know kind of like einstein
126:37 - level
126:38 - you know which is crazy right but yeah
126:40 - if you think about it yes you're not
126:42 - creating any hardware per se here
126:44 - but if you have an idea and you create a
126:46 - software that can help a lot of people
126:48 - yes you're taking an idea from your head
126:50 - and you're putting into for people to
126:52 - use
126:53 - yeah exactly like that's awesome am i
126:55 - right yeah
126:56 - right i mean that that's that's what you
126:58 - have to think about i mean
127:00 - as a designer i'm always thinking like
127:01 - oh how am i gonna make this better for
127:03 - this person
127:03 - and what i want to do for this yeah
127:05 - exactly well i take the same concept
127:07 - i'm thinking like hey you know what in
127:09 - software yeah how do you how are they
127:11 - going to approach it how they're going
127:12 - to look at it how they're going to like
127:13 - go around it i love it i just ask
127:15 - questions so
127:16 - that's good well it's problem solving
127:18 - that's probably it's it's all promising
127:20 - and it's honestly
127:21 - it's the most fun right so i think yeah
127:23 - if that's what if that's what you like
127:24 - ron i think uh
127:26 - you're in a good position you're in a
127:27 - good position to learn at this point now
127:29 - you just need to put in a lot of work
127:31 - and learning
127:32 - and you will get to it right
127:35 - and most importantly just don't let
127:37 - anything else stop you
127:38 - no i mean with the community and i think
127:40 - i see everyone here that's awesome
127:42 - that wants to do something you know
127:44 - we'll all be friends and
127:46 - you know definitely be like working all
127:49 - together probably you know
127:50 - i love that love yeah we'll go together

128:49 - all right next question we got joseph
128:52 - hello my friend
128:56 - go ahead hi joseph
129:00 - hey sorry about that oh so how
129:03 - um how creative can we get with this i
129:06 - mean i've
129:07 - been doing you guys tutorials since back
129:09 - on the uh
129:11 - disney clone oh wow really yeah i've
129:13 - done them all back since you started
129:15 - with the
129:16 - to-do app nice it's uh react and i
129:19 - actually
129:20 - uh went to boot camp for react but
129:22 - unfortunately
129:23 - there's a lot of things you're not uh
129:27 - trained for you're not you're throwing a
129:29 - bunch of things i come from an
129:30 - engineering background
129:31 - so you're throwing a bunch of things and
129:33 - it's like here do this
129:35 - and then how do you get around
129:38 - per se a lot of companies want
129:42 - a bachelor's degree and where i'm at in
129:44 - florida that's like the big staple
129:47 - that i'm the big big brick wall i'm
129:49 - smacking into that's
129:52 - hard and like how do i push
129:56 - past that like whenever i follow you up
129:58 - with one you guys provided which is
130:00 - a lot better than the one i designed
130:04 - how do you going forward how do you push
130:07 - past that
130:08 - with that mindset is what my question is
130:12 - so good question i think
130:16 - basically i'm going to read it what
130:18 - you're asking right so
130:20 - you're asking me basically right you're
130:22 - currently in florida
130:23 - and you're trying to figure out uh kind
130:26 - of like a lot of companies you're saying
130:27 - that are asking for a bachelor's degree
130:30 - and of course you're in an engineering
130:31 - background right now and what do you do
130:32 - right now
130:33 - in terms of engineering at beckham um i
130:37 - haven't done anything with six years i'm
130:38 - actually disabled now oh so i stepped
130:40 - away from
130:40 - yeah so i programmed uh
130:43 - roughly 7 a.m to 2 a.m
130:46 - so i'm always programming wow i'm always
130:48 - doing something wow
130:50 - and i have the technical knowledge
130:53 - but i want to go your you kind of you
130:55 - you've i've mainly followed you and i
130:57 - you've kind of inspired me a lot because
131:00 - i want to go to the freelance route and
131:02 - i want to go and i don't know how to
131:04 - get there okay that's why i came to you
131:06 - guys for that road map how do i
131:07 - get there and avoid the corporate
131:10 - aspect yeah so of course so i am
131:14 - so one video you should watch is i had
131:16 - on youtube and write this down
131:18 - there's a video on youtube that i i did
131:21 - with blake connolly
131:22 - and um and he
131:25 - is a ceo of a freelancing software
131:28 - agency
131:29 - uh basically and he's only 20 23 years
131:31 - old
131:32 - and yeah only 23 years old and he's
131:34 - still a sub agency
131:36 - and a million dollars off their agency
131:38 - which is crazy
131:41 - and he started off literally with like
131:43 - um
131:44 - he started out with you know just kind
131:46 - of doing small projects by himself
131:49 - um he started i was just doing some
131:51 - upworks and freelancing projects
131:54 - building really low not making a lot of
131:56 - money initially
131:57 - but as he got more reviews as he got
131:59 - more you know as he got more experience
132:01 - he was able to rack up his price to this
132:03 - point
132:04 - i mean he's charging over a hundred
132:05 - dollars per hour and you know some of
132:07 - his projects are worth you know
132:09 - uh a few hundred thousand dollars right
132:12 - when he's working with the team
132:13 - okay because i asked sex i'm sure there
132:15 - are others amongst the other 200 or so
132:17 - of us that are here
132:18 - that probably think the same thing and
132:22 - i've done uh i've been stuck in tutorial
132:25 - health for
132:26 - about five years and it's
132:30 - that's where why i've come to this boot
132:32 - camp cause i wanna see if i can
132:34 - connect the dots to break free from that
132:37 - yeah because tutorial health if a lot of
132:39 - you guys don't know it some of you don't
132:41 - it's it's a nasty cycle it's a nasty
132:44 - cycle oils
132:45 - and you're trying to build stuff on your
132:48 - own but you may lack the either the
132:49 - creativity
132:51 - or you like the direction to get those
132:54 - tutorials or to make your own things and
132:57 - it's not easy i mean i still find myself
132:59 - i
133:00 - i'll design something on paper and i'm
133:01 - like well let me go throw it in figma
133:04 - let me go throw it in adobe
133:06 - xd let me figure out and then you'll get
133:08 - stuck
133:09 - and that's why i'm that's why i came
133:11 - here because i want to see in the next
133:13 - five days can i do
133:15 - your three projects on my own and see
133:18 - you know how do i get there that's why i
133:20 - thought i would ask you it's why i kind
133:22 - of dropped in here today was that was
133:23 - like i'm gonna ask dad
133:24 - if he knows how to make that dot
133:28 - is so let me ask you this question like
133:32 - what kind of like what kind of things
133:33 - have you learned before like what kind
133:34 - of fundamentals do you know
133:36 - um i started with c sharp okay i worked
133:39 - my way up through javascript html5
133:42 - css3 bootstrap material ui into react
133:46 - uh es6 7 8 9 and 10. okay and i've
133:50 - worked my way through
133:52 - uh i didn't learn data and algorithms
133:55 - okay unfortunately
133:56 - so joseph i if i if i were to here to
133:59 - ask you one question
134:01 - if i told you right now joseph can you
134:02 - for example
134:04 - if i was to give you a javascript
134:05 - problem and i asked you hey can you
134:07 - for me um merge if i give you two arrays
134:11 - in javascript one array call a one
134:14 - array called b and they both had numbers
134:16 - in them if i could talk to create a
134:18 - function for me to merge them together
134:21 - would you be able to do it yeah you
134:24 - you would look through both of them and
134:26 - you would merge them as the final
134:28 - product you would print them out as a
134:29 - final in a third
134:32 - uh object you would create a third uh
134:35 - variable to merge those two into one
134:37 - how using that okay so okay so use the
134:39 - loop and then what would you do
134:41 - you would map through a and you would
134:42 - map through b so you use a for loop
134:44 - you use a for loop and you'd say four uh
134:48 - iss and five uh
134:52 - i plus plus if that one
134:57 - you'd use a map function you you would
134:58 - map through it and then you would add it
135:00 - you would print that out add those add
135:02 - that variable to the next
135:04 - function with a another for loop using
135:06 - the variable k
135:08 - and so on and you print those both out
135:10 - with uh
135:11 - console log uh i plus k
135:14 - or whatever variable you assigned those
135:17 - two for loops too
135:18 - so then so you're kind of there but
135:22 - you're kind of there but um in the in
135:25 - the actual response what you would do
135:27 - and you're really close is you said loop
135:29 - through through the first frame and loop
135:30 - through a second array really what you
135:31 - would do is you look to the first array
135:33 - and you do use a dot push to push to
135:35 - another variable that you just created
135:37 - right
135:38 - let's just say the variable is called c
135:39 - and you do that push from first array to
135:41 - another another to that c
135:43 - uh variable and then you look at the
135:45 - second array b
135:46 - and you'll do a dot push from that array
135:49 - to
135:50 - then the c as well yeah okay no to the
135:52 - same to the same to the same c array
135:54 - right
135:54 - so that's how you merge them together
135:56 - you just print out c which can change
135:58 - both of them
135:58 - exactly exactly so that that's where i
136:01 - missed the push part
136:02 - you see someone's almost no you're
136:04 - really close so i think
136:05 - what where you're lacking right now is
136:07 - you're very close to kind of like what
136:09 - what you know you build a lot of
136:11 - projects you're liking
136:12 - some of the most fundamentals right yes
136:14 - you do need to know some
136:16 - um some what's it called some um
136:19 - algorithms algorithms and data
136:20 - structures right but that's mostly if
136:22 - you
136:23 - if you were to get a job at a company if
136:25 - you're
136:26 - if that's not your goal and you just
136:27 - want to go to freelancer route which i
136:29 - will tell you is not going to be easy
136:31 - right huh i don't
136:34 - expect you yeah it's not going to be i'd
136:35 - rather i'd rather earn that paycheck
136:38 - like
136:39 - like uh connolly's case where i start
136:42 - small
136:42 - and work my way up to where i can say
136:44 - hey i am but let me ask you a question
136:46 - let me question why are you so afraid to
136:47 - work in a company
136:51 - being disabled um one of my things is
136:54 - i don't deal well with
136:57 - uh being micromanaged
137:01 - and so a lot of the companies i've
137:02 - worked for at my age i'm 37
137:05 - so when i was just still young i yeah
137:08 - oh thanks a lot when i was younger in my
137:10 - early 20s i actually had a job in the
137:12 - engineering firm
137:13 - and when i lost that job i got this big
137:16 - chip on my shoulder
137:17 - that i couldn't come overcome so i went
137:19 - through a bunch of jobs after that
137:21 - as a freelancer that i ended up
137:25 - not knowing then that i didn't like
137:28 - working for
137:29 - other people in corporations because i
137:31 - had no say i had no
137:33 - presence i was just a monkey
137:36 - monkey see monkey do and that's what i
137:38 - felt and so
137:40 - to go the freelance route would be i
137:42 - would have that sense of individuality
137:44 - that sense of control
137:45 - mm-hmm and say hey hey nas i want to do
137:48 - this project for you cool
137:49 - let's let let's talk about it you know
137:51 - let's let's get this project done
137:53 - whereas you're telling me what you want
137:56 - i give you what you want
137:58 - but you don't hold all the power in that
138:01 - relationship it's a given time yeah and
138:04 - a corporation it's not really so much
138:06 - that when you're the new man on totem
138:07 - pole
138:08 - yeah you're you're expected to do with
138:11 - very little say
138:12 - so and that's what what is it what
138:14 - what's the most thing what's the most
138:16 - and this is for anybody here i'm very
138:17 - curious actually anybody here who's
138:18 - currently in
138:20 - in the zoom what's the most important
138:22 - what's the most important thing for
138:24 - you in terms of work
138:29 - hold on you're muted i can't hear you
138:31 - sorry
138:32 - my my shut off for me it's the freedom
138:35 - to again like how you and
138:38 - uh qazi started out it's the freedom to
138:41 - set my own projects to set my own rates
138:43 - to have that freedom where
138:45 - i control how much i want to work i want
138:48 - to work 60 hours a week cool
138:50 - i have the project signed up i can do
138:52 - that but i have
138:54 - the will the the freedom to decide
138:57 - and if a company comes along and says
138:58 - hey i want to offer you 100 grand a year
139:02 - i know i'm worth that i have the backing
139:04 - with all the projects i've done on say
139:06 - upwork and whatnot as a freelancer
139:08 - whereas right now i have no experience
139:11 - and a lot of times a lot of these
139:13 - companies are calling me up and i kid
139:14 - you not
139:15 - anybody in the zoo i've had plenty of
139:17 - people call me up off of linkedin i've
139:19 - got over 900
139:20 - connections on linkedin and i have
139:22 - recruiters calling me
139:24 - every other day saying hey i have this i
139:27 - have
139:28 - uh i have this javascript uh full stack
139:31 - developer job i have this react
139:32 - developer job a
139:33 - remote
139:37 - so and they'll call me and say hey i
139:38 - have the senior developer job this
139:41 - junior developer job whatever but once
139:43 - they hear i don't have a degree
139:45 - and i don't have any experience goodbye
139:49 - it's not i see what you mean i see what
139:52 - you mean so
139:53 - degree and experience i think
139:57 - so look yes the degree portion is
140:00 - sometimes hard for but these companies
140:03 - right but what i'll tell you is that
140:07 - for example for me at this point i don't
140:10 - put my degree on the resume
140:12 - right right i've got i've got the
140:15 - experience the one year the one the
140:17 - first job experience
140:18 - at wherever i am right
140:21 - and then now it doesn't really matter
140:23 - what kind of it doesn't really matter
140:25 - what kind of experience
140:26 - what degree you have for you what i
140:29 - think
140:30 - is happening here is you're looking for
140:31 - the wrong jobs
140:35 - you're looking for you're looking for
140:37 - the wrong jobs so
140:38 - i think what you could do is yes you can
140:41 - start doing freelancing and you can you
140:42 - can go that route that is correct
140:44 - you should go that route and then um try
140:46 - to pursue that route right
140:48 - the second round that you should go
140:50 - through though
140:51 - is actually going to be is actually the
140:54 - route with
140:55 - one finding companies that are more so
140:57 - on the startup side
141:00 - because those companies give you a lot
141:01 - more freedom
141:03 - and those companies give you uh don't
141:05 - really care about about the degrees at
141:06 - all
141:07 - they give zero shits about that no i'm
141:10 - not kidding you i'm not
141:11 - they really don't care what degree you
141:13 - have or not they just want somebody to
141:14 - help them out and actually build stuff
141:16 - and on top of that you have a lot more
141:17 - leverage and a lot more freedom to build
141:19 - things that you want because
141:20 - your say has a lot in in that startup
141:24 - company's coming to you with
141:26 - yeah i need you to do for me exactly
141:30 - not oh you're just a part of the team
141:32 - exactly you're
141:33 - you're expendable even if that means
141:35 - that you wrote for free for a little bit
141:37 - like joseph you have to be open to that
141:39 - because i know you haven't worked for
141:40 - the past what
141:41 - i think you said six years or something
141:42 - right yeah you have to be open to even
141:45 - you know what hey guys i'll work for
141:46 - free for you for a little bit
141:48 - well i'm actually volunteering with
141:49 - inkscape right now beautiful
141:51 - so and they've already said you know
141:54 - they want to talk to me about an
141:55 - apprenticeship which is great and all
141:57 - but
141:57 - django is not my forte but i don't mind
141:59 - learning it and i'm open to
142:01 - giving up my time i'm okay with that
142:03 - yeah it's just i don't want to be taken
142:05 - advantage of
142:06 - yeah i get it i totally i totally get
142:09 - that and this is
142:10 - where this is where you learn how to set
142:12 - your boundaries
142:14 - and this is where you keep your options
142:16 - open
142:18 - because i still plan on finishing ul's
142:20 - boot camp for the five days i mean i
142:21 - still want to do it anyways
142:22 - yeah just more experience yeah and the
142:24 - homework gives me something to do
142:26 - yeah but how do you and i'm sure the
142:29 - other
142:30 - the other one in the zoom might see it
142:32 - as well but
142:33 - how do you avoid getting hit with uh
142:37 - learning a million things at once like
142:38 - for a lot of people who don't know
142:40 - programming html css javascript those
142:43 - are fundamentals
142:44 - yeah how do you not get sucked into
142:47 - we're gonna learn
142:49 - uh react we're gonna learn python we're
142:50 - gonna learn django we're gonna learn
142:52 - you focus on one you focus on one
142:56 - well it's but it's really not it's just
142:59 - discipline
143:00 - it's discipline well it's literally just
143:03 - discipline because joseph the thing is
143:05 - oh yeah if i was to give you tips i
143:07 - would give you a tip but the thing is
143:08 - like
143:09 - for example the tip for you would be
143:10 - like to find somebody who keeps you
143:12 - accountable
143:14 - may that be a mentor or somebody else
143:16 - cause somebody people
143:17 - do need for that right but it depends on
143:18 - how good you are with money like do you
143:20 - like for example if you can't spend
143:22 - money yourself and you can find a mentor
143:24 - that will keep you kind of make sure
143:25 - that you don't sway outside the box
143:28 - and that's maybe something you need even
143:31 - that's more or less like if you were to
143:34 - say hey joe i need a
143:35 - i need a html website by tomorrow
143:37 - morning at 11am
143:39 - you know and you you call me at 10
143:42 - o'clock
143:43 - are you done yet or if i get stuck i can
143:46 - talk to you see that's what i'm looking
143:47 - for is more of a mentor but i haven't
143:49 - found anything
143:50 - i mean yeah i mean that's that's that's
143:53 - the hardest thing yes
143:54 - like without you trying to really talk
143:56 - about the opportunity of you know within
143:58 - how working or within clever programmer
144:01 - right which is that's what we do help
144:02 - our students with because i'm not trying
144:03 - to sell you on that that's part of one
144:05 - right
144:06 - though though you know like yes so we do
144:08 - offer that ability right
144:10 - of course especially as we get towards
144:11 - the end the boot camp we'll talk about
144:12 - that
144:13 - but yeah for those people who do need
144:16 - some little more discipline this is
144:17 - where you might need somebody
144:18 - somebody else's help right and if you
144:21 - think that you know what i can't afford
144:22 - somebody else's help
144:23 - then you just need to sit your butt down
144:26 - and write down
144:26 - things and just do it yeah
144:30 - that's that's that's a lot of people
144:32 - probably can relate to that
144:33 - yes honestly other than tutorial hell
144:36 - i'd say
144:37 - and maybe i'm wrong i'd say that's the
144:38 - hardest thing that really is
144:40 - the discipline this is
144:43 - this is where you know a mentor is so
144:46 - important and a structure right
144:47 - like for example when later on when we
144:48 - talk about the boot camp that we have
144:49 - for example you guys are able to
144:51 - potentially potentially join
144:52 - yes the thing that a lot of our students
144:54 - are requiring when they join
144:56 - is a structure right
144:59 - you right now go from the tour tutorial
145:00 - because there's a bunch of like
145:02 - tutorials and
145:03 - you know you don't really know what your
145:04 - structure is you don't have a problem
145:06 - roadmap am i right yep exactly yep
145:10 - so go ahead even with the boot camp it's
145:13 - still
145:14 - and i'm sure i think gavin's still in
145:16 - here and there's a few others
145:18 - that are in boot camps like flat iron or
145:20 - whatnot unfortunately
145:22 - even my own a lot of them were
145:26 - uh you're on your own pretty much that's
145:28 - unfortunate
145:30 - if you were like part-time basically you
145:32 - watch your videos you do this stuff on
145:34 - your own time
145:35 - and or or if you were full-time you had
145:37 - to look up everything
145:39 - and it's all things you could have done
145:41 - without going to the boot camp
145:43 - yeah and that's where a lot of us are a
145:45 - lot of us grad your stuff
145:47 - no i get it i get it yeah this is where
145:49 - it you know
145:50 - you have to find the right opportunity
145:53 - and you're the right person to get you
145:54 - you just need to keep searching
145:56 - like well sorry sorry to bug you with a
145:58 - with a
145:59 - loaded question i'm sure everybody else
146:01 - has other questions
146:02 - yeah yeah no no it's not just more
146:04 - important no no no no
146:05 - other question is more important i think
146:06 - these are all good questions that
146:08 - definitely relate to a lot of people
146:09 - right i think you know the answer to
146:11 - this question is just simply like
146:12 - we just need to get started discipline
146:14 - get really disciplined and don't let
146:16 - yourself get swayed by other focuses
146:18 - right
146:18 - oh this is view just oh it's so good oh
146:21 - english is so good no
146:23 - if your focus is front development with
146:25 - javascript and react gs you stay focused
146:27 - on that and only that right
146:29 - if you find something exactly if you
146:31 - find something where
146:32 - you have a structure right a structure
146:35 - where they give you structure and you
146:36 - have to follow it
146:37 - follow that right so if you have the
146:39 - ability to invest yourself to do that
146:41 - do that right that's what i'm doing
146:43 - right now is i'm trying to sit down and
146:46 - uh like my wife would tell me is that
146:48 - i'm always doing what everybody else
146:50 - wants me to do
146:51 - and now i'm just going to sit down and
146:52 - do what i want to do become selfish
146:55 - yeah that's what she's basically saying
146:56 - be selfish and do the projects you want
146:58 - to do
146:59 - the way you want to do them yep exactly
147:01 - somebody will come along
147:03 - exactly and say hey i saw your projects

150:43 - doing my how are you doing back
150:45 - wait now hold on there's hold on i'm
150:47 - trying to click on it go ahead back
150:51 - you got it how do i
150:56 - what's wrong i can't hear you
151:02 - hello can you hear me
151:08 - yeah now you're good go ahead you can
151:09 - talk now
151:12 - i can barely i can barely hear you you
151:15 - got some weird sound like
151:16 - are you somewhere outside or no no
151:19 - oh now i can hear you there we go
151:25 - can you hear me now yeah i can hear you
151:28 - okay there we go it must have been my
151:30 - headphones
151:30 - okay it's so adorable
151:34 - do you need to know like ux ui design
151:38 - as a full stock developer do you need to
151:42 - no you really don't you don't you don't
151:43 - need that does not need to be your
151:46 - full-on priority
151:47 - um though as you start to build more
151:49 - applications you start to get much
151:51 - better at it because
151:52 - as a front developer you actually will
151:54 - be working a lot with with
151:56 - ui ux designers and so you will start to
151:58 - get a hunch of these ui ux designs right
152:01 - um and start to get more understanding
152:03 - like okay well this looks good and this
152:04 - looks good and this looks good
152:06 - um so most of the time what happens is
152:10 - you'll have a design in front of you and
152:12 - then you'll be able to ha
152:13 - and you'll have to know how to make it
152:15 - uh real basically on the web page
152:19 - does that make sense yeah awesome
152:22 - i've been like phoned a couple of things
152:25 - but i've not
152:27 - designed is just it's not my thing no
152:30 - don't worry about it if you focus on
152:33 - just taking any design

155:09 - it simultaneously as well
155:10 - wait what dashboard where are you at
155:12 - what do you mean um the clever
155:13 - programming site

155:18 - um where it says uh learn web
155:20 - development by building
155:21 - oh there there no focus focus focus on
155:25 - focus on the 5-day boot camp for now
155:27 - okay okay
155:28 - got it right and then of course and then
155:30 - later on you can focus on the learned uh
155:32 - by building projects
155:34 - okay cool so that's afterwards basically
155:37 - yeah right
155:37 - i mean you can i mean for some people
155:39 - they do it during they do it at the same
155:41 - time because like
155:42 - that learn development building projects
155:44 - has some good substance to it has really
155:46 - good like
155:46 - basic fundamentals you guys will get to
155:48 - learn right
155:50 - and so for example if you're waiting

155:53 - few videos and yes do them
155:55 - yeah yeah uh it looks interesting i
155:57 - already have um some um

159:59 - awesome and so and so like what do you
160:02 - do there like a front developer backing
160:03 - developer or what
160:05 - um the angular developer even using a
160:07 - file is for authentication
160:09 - and doing a google cloud for deploying
160:12 - websites
160:13 - that's cool that's cool that's awesome
160:15 - i'm just curious why did you think that
160:17 - you
160:18 - what was the goal to join like an eight
160:19 - month course what was the goal for that
160:22 - i want to become a full step developer
160:24 - okay and
160:26 - uh as i'm literally i i did a
160:29 - front-end developer for four months four
160:32 - years
160:32 - but i think it is just a
160:36 - few things to become a great
160:42 - it's not my career right i want to
160:44 - become a full tech developer front end
160:46 - it's
160:47 - nothing for me like i i'm thinking okay
160:49 - i like it yeah
160:51 - i think what you're doing right now is
160:52 - great is you start out with the front
160:53 - end and so like
160:55 - the next step for you to learn in the
160:56 - back is going to be like the back end so
160:57 - it's like to makes you like a full-on
160:59 - false developer
161:00 - so i think you're in a really good path
161:02 - uh
161:03 - and of course you already have a startup
161:05 - job which is great that's
161:06 - actually how i started at a startup
161:08 - company and then so the opportunity
161:10 - there at that point it's just pretty
161:12 - pretty amazing

161:17 - the
161:17 - class that javascript is very important

164:21 - yeah i'm doing well being in new york
164:24 - and uh
164:25 - you're in new york yeah i'm in
164:27 - queensland i'm actually about
164:28 - 60 minutes away from jfk oh they i love
164:32 - that
164:32 - okay okay okay awesome so what's your
164:33 - question my friend so i just had a quick
164:36 - question right because
164:37 - i i mean i did a lot of vmware support
164:41 - uh cisco uh domain deployment and
164:44 - support
164:45 - but never kind of worked on on the
164:48 - software side right software development
164:50 - on it
164:50 - so but that's always something that had
164:53 - me
164:54 - interested um so i'm kind of
164:58 - starting up right now so what are some
165:00 - of the things that uh
165:02 - i would need to kind of look at in order
165:04 - for me to
165:05 - uh get better at uh
165:08 - understanding and doing things yeah from
165:11 - scratch because that's one of the things
165:13 - like a lot of people uh doing projects
165:16 - from scratch
165:18 - it's a little bit of a problem but yeah
165:19 - i love baseball right and
165:21 - and we do have a site for the team
165:25 - but it's very basic and so one of the
165:28 - things that i was
165:30 - i wanted to do was basically look at
165:33 - code and basically update the site to
165:36 - look
165:37 - and feel better have better
165:39 - functionality
165:40 - and uh so so what are some of the things
165:42 - that uh i could do
165:44 - in order to improve myself uh you know
165:47 - to move forward
165:48 - okay good question good question so let
165:50 - me first ask you this question like
165:53 - why why do you want it back in to go
165:56 - into coding because when i brought you
165:57 - what did you say you were doing right
165:58 - now
165:59 - um i was doing a lot of uh vmware and
166:02 - do you work at a company do you work for
166:04 - a company right now
166:06 - uh no they all the jobs they move them
166:09 - out to
166:10 - either texas india or uk and i was not
166:14 - moving out there
166:15 - oh wow that's because i have family i
166:17 - mean i well i have one kid already out
166:18 - of college
166:20 - but my daughter still has two more years
166:22 - of college so
166:23 - i i opted to take a package instead
166:27 - so i wanted to do this because
166:31 - it gives me a lot more flexibility as
166:34 - far as
166:35 - where i can work with i can work from
166:36 - anywhere yeah i do something like this
166:39 - i love you know technology but this is
166:42 - something that i think
166:44 - anybody can do from anywhere it doesn't
166:46 - matter where you live
166:47 - right so it gives you more uh that
166:51 - time for you to spend with your family
166:54 - but also you know do the things that you
166:56 - like to do and that's
166:57 - something that i love to do that's right
167:00 - and it will give me a lot more freedom
167:02 - and you know i could just retire now but
167:05 - i can't just sit home
167:07 - uh you're antsy you're antsy you're like
167:09 - i can't say it
167:12 - i need something to do right so and
167:14 - that's something that's
167:15 - interesting and you know i love baseball
167:18 - and i wanted to kind of help the team to
167:21 - even
167:22 - improve the site nice how it looks and
167:25 - and you know start working on different
167:27 - projects moving forward
167:28 - okay but that's one of the things that i
167:30 - wanted to do and
167:32 - i want to get really good at it um i do
167:35 - have a lot of time
167:36 - on my hands so i can so one of the
167:39 - things i want
167:40 - is more or less have an idea what things
167:43 - i can
167:44 - i can focus on to to
167:47 - get better at it and move forward from
167:49 - there so so good question i think
167:51 - i think for you to number one is i think
167:53 - you're in a good place right now with
167:55 - for example even kind of being in this
167:56 - community right
167:58 - where we'll give you we will give you
167:59 - some structure around you know
168:01 - these next five days but after these
168:03 - next five days
168:05 - um i think if you're going to focus on
168:07 - the front end for example
168:08 - then yes you want to focus on for
168:10 - example these technologies like like
168:12 - html like css and javascript
168:14 - most importantly what you want to focus
168:15 - on is learning those kind of fundamental
168:17 - parts of
168:18 - the coding portion right so you kind of
168:20 - want to get yourself really really good
168:23 - with
168:23 - you know different types of you know
168:27 - problems that you that come with you
168:29 - know with coding
168:30 - right now the question might be okay
168:33 - where do i see
168:34 - those problems or where did i get those
168:35 - problems right
168:37 - a few things the way you get those
168:40 - problems
168:41 - is actually by for example just kind of
168:43 - how you said
168:44 - looking at the project that you had
168:46 - which is your baseball project right
168:48 - and actually looking to fix it right and
168:50 - figure out how to do it
168:52 - you know like this the learning process
168:55 - here is almost like have havoc a little
168:56 - bit here
168:57 - sometimes you know sometimes it's not
169:00 - doesn't have to be so structured it
169:02 - doesn't have to be so
169:02 - point by point by point instead it's
169:05 - sometimes can be more on the side of
169:07 - okay i have a problem ahead of me let's
169:10 - figure out
169:11 - what how do i get how do i solve it
169:15 - so for example yeah go ahead no no go
169:18 - ahead
169:19 - so so for example in your case if you
169:21 - for example have a website in front of
169:23 - you and you're like okay
169:24 - well i'm gonna update it here's my
169:27 - process how would you
169:28 - i would look like edit like that i would
169:30 - say okay so how do i want to update how
169:32 - do i want to update my site so the first
169:33 - question i'll ask myself how do i want
169:35 - to update my site
169:36 - right and i will literally draw out
169:39 - things that i want to change to it
169:40 - i will draw or literally take a piece of
169:42 - paper now
169:44 - draw it out in terms of how do i want it
169:45 - to change how do i want it to look like
169:48 - okay right so that'll be the first step
169:50 - i would take okay that gives me some
169:52 - visual around what needs to happen
169:55 - okay then the second thing that i would
169:58 - do after that point is okay so i've got
170:00 - that visual now at this point
170:01 - i would actually i don't know where your
170:04 - site is for example loaded
170:06 - my goal next goal would be okay how can
170:08 - i get a hold of that site and
170:10 - how can i get a hold of that code
170:14 - right instead of my next task okay so my
170:16 - next step is like okay
170:18 - well i've got this website that's
170:20 - currently there where can i see the
170:22 - code that's your task number two
170:25 - my test number three at that point okay
170:26 - great so now do i have that
170:29 - what do i need to do where in the code
170:31 - or how do i need to change it up
170:33 - in terms of the code on the coding
170:34 - portion now this is where you might be
170:37 - stuck am i right
170:39 - yes okay so now at this point where okay
170:42 - you have to there's two steps
170:43 - the first step is that you just kind of
170:45 - divide your little problem into small
170:47 - pieces
170:48 - and you think and you ask yourself the
170:51 - questions okay
170:52 - okay let's just say you need to change
170:54 - the header
170:56 - right you figure out okay how do i
170:58 - change the header in a website
171:01 - so you go to google okay creating a
171:04 - header and a website you type in
171:05 - creating header for a website
171:08 - and you start to see code you start to
171:10 - see people doing different types of
171:11 - headers
171:12 - right right right you start to see
171:15 - different examples
171:17 - and you implement that right that's your
171:20 - first pathway so kind of like more so
171:23 - backtracking
171:23 - right you have the problem or you're
171:25 - trying to go backtrack from it
171:27 - the second pathway is okay i see what i
171:30 - need to do i'm going to give it a pause
171:32 - and instead i'm going to learn some
171:34 - basic things around coding
171:36 - so maybe i would go to free code camp
171:39 - and i'll learn some basic html some
171:41 - basic css
171:43 - and some basic javascript
171:46 - okay because there are pathways to that
171:50 - right and then at that point what i
171:52 - might do is maybe after that
171:54 - what i might do also is maybe i might at
171:56 - the same time
171:58 - i might join a five day coding bootcamp
171:59 - which you are in right now
172:02 - and so now i'm going to try and apply
172:04 - those skills to my html css skills to
172:06 - javascript right right i'll now
172:10 - learn how to create a simple website or
172:12 - apply those skills sorry apply those
172:13 - skills
172:14 - to the website not javascript but go to
172:16 - the website
172:17 - so now maybe you'll learn how to build a
172:19 - few projects with me
172:21 - right now it's time to apply that
172:23 - knowledge
172:24 - towards other things by yourself
172:29 - i gotcha and so that's the process i
172:30 - would take
172:32 - make sense thank you that makes sense
172:35 - makes sense thanks thanks a lot for
172:37 - the uh the explanation i think you know
172:41 - putting a big problem into into small
172:43 - pieces
172:44 - yeah it is uh it becomes easier to
172:47 - um actually uh correct 100
172:51 - 100 literally just like whenever i
172:55 - one of the biggest things that i know as
172:57 - a good developer that uh like
172:59 - my strength my strength as a developer
173:01 - is being able to take a big plot problem
173:04 - and then split up into multiple pieces
173:07 - thank you that's a lot of people are
173:09 - struggling with guys a lot of you people
173:11 - on zoom right now on youtube
173:14 - that's your struggle right but that's
173:17 - actually a
173:18 - biggest game changer for any developer
173:22 - like i have managers who would come to
173:24 - me like jonas can you come
173:26 - you know can you come into the room
173:28 - because there's a bunch of these
173:29 - you know uh business people and and even
173:32 - developers and nobody knows how to solve
173:34 - something that's because you guys are
173:36 - looking too much from a higher point of
173:38 - view
173:39 - and this is one humongous problem it's
173:41 - like for example if you were to build a
173:43 - building
173:44 - if you're building a building and all
173:46 - you saw was just a huge
173:48 - building you need to build people like
173:50 - holy how am i supposed
173:52 - to do this true but versus if you were
173:55 - to build a building you
173:56 - you start out from okay well let's first
173:57 - build the structure of the building
173:59 - the foundation be beside behind the
174:01 - layer last time build the beams
174:03 - okay then let's go ahead and build the
174:06 - walls around it right
174:07 - and then we can build the things on the
174:08 - inside right so like it's
174:10 - it becomes a lot easier right
174:14 - right so that's i want to think of this
174:16 - that's how you think of coding as well
174:20 - cool cool awesome lewis thank you much
174:23 - okay awesome louis well i'll see you
174:26 - tomorrow at 11am psc okay
174:28 - indeed we'll be there okay bye-bye have
174:30 - a good day bye-bye thanks
174:33 - next up let's see uh alex go ahead
174:40 - what's up nice little bit over facebook
174:43 - all right man all right oh yeah alex
174:45 - alex bishop as a right
174:47 - yeah hey let's go okay awesome
174:51 - man so i got some questions and i know
174:53 - uh we can't cover
174:54 - everything in five days obviously of
174:56 - course not
174:57 - are we going to go over like algorithms
174:59 - and uh algorithms and uh like
175:02 - database stuff and stuff like that or so
175:05 - yes we will call it that's going to be
175:06 - in like the
175:06 - we will cover databases so
175:10 - the data structures that's an eight
175:11 - month course okay
175:13 - but we will cover some databases because
175:15 - again it's really hard to just
175:18 - to cover all of that in these these next
175:20 - few these next five you know these next
175:21 - four days you know or even the
175:23 - three days of coding it's really hard to
175:24 - do that um right
175:26 - but we will cover like for example data
175:28 - structures like arrays and
175:29 - objects and we will cover databases like
175:32 - firebase as well
175:34 - it's cool makes sense and then yeah so
175:38 - most importantly i think you'll just see
175:39 - the possibilities that you can have with
175:41 - coding and then
175:42 - you'll be able to actually build
175:44 - something fully by yourself as well to
175:46 - be like oh
175:47 - i can actually do this you know what i
175:48 - mean so you kind of
175:51 - you kind of you kind of see in the big
175:52 - picture and then we'll step
175:54 - back and be like okay let's make this
175:56 - big picture so solid
175:58 - and let's start building those building
175:59 - blocks one by one
176:03 - sounds good man sounds good sounds good
176:05 - to me awesome where you where are you
176:06 - from alex
176:08 - i'm in jersey you're in jersey really
176:10 - well so many people from new york and
176:11 - new jersey i don't know what what are
176:12 - you guys all doing here i understand
176:16 - like so many students are from that from
176:18 - that side you know
176:20 - yeah man yeah man all right you know
176:22 - we're all trying to make it over there
176:26 - and what are you currently doing how
176:28 - it's going jacob
176:29 - what are you currently doing i'm a
176:32 - volunteer firefighter and i uh oh yeah
176:34 - that's right
176:35 - yeah you're a firefighter right and so
176:37 - you want to eat why did you want to
176:38 - switch the career
176:40 - uh it's dangerous work for one um
176:44 - two like it like i said before like it's
176:46 - not really
176:47 - thought-provoking work it's kind of just
176:49 - like you do the same thing over and over
176:52 - uh you are solving problems but you know
176:54 - it's kind of like
176:55 - it's in a different sense and yeah
176:58 - you know i i kind of prefer this kind of
177:00 - stuff um
177:02 - you know i've tried to do my own like
177:04 - small projects and stuff like that
177:06 - gotcha and uh yeah man it's pretty
177:08 - that's cool
177:09 - so so what was the what's the reason now
177:11 - to get into coding
177:14 - um well like i said i like to build my
177:16 - own projects
177:17 - uh i have like a lot of ideas um
177:20 - i'm also uh an entrepreneur like i
177:24 - run like a stock market group oh no way
177:27 - really yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm
177:30 - gonna i'm going to stock market as well
177:33 - oh okay yeah cool yeah one thing to make
177:35 - a lot of money is uh algorithmic
177:36 - platforms
177:37 - oh i just said you know um that are like
177:39 - even you buy and sell signals
177:41 - like something i want to build on my own
177:43 - because you get a quote from some of
177:45 - these places they're charging you like
177:47 - 25 000 for a project like that you're
177:50 - kidding really
177:52 - yeah man yeah it's expensive
177:55 - so uh yeah that's basically kind of what
177:58 - what i'm looking at like my own like my
178:01 - own projects
178:02 - and working you know full-time job so
178:04 - that's awesome that's sweet oh well you
178:06 - know i'm pumped to have you here you
178:07 - know i think it's really cool that
178:08 - you're doing this
178:09 - the fact that you're putting the time
178:11 - into it and you're working hard towards
178:12 - it
178:13 - i'm excited to see what you do in these
178:14 - next three days give it your all and
178:17 - show me what you got serious
178:21 - awesome all right alex i'll see you
178:22 - tomorrow at 11 okay
178:25 - see you then okay bye-bye okay next up

179:04 - i'm a college student uh community
179:06 - college uh um
179:08 - like i wanna i wanna get a bachelor's
179:10 - degree in computer science
179:12 - but i currently work out of where so
179:14 - like i i don't really like it
179:15 - and uh wait hold on hold on hold on hold
179:18 - on
179:20 - uh how do i remove share screen
179:24 - thank you okay thank you all right go
179:27 - ahead abe
179:28 - yeah like i said um i currently work at
179:30 - a warehouse
179:31 - and i don't really like it and uh
179:34 - towards the fall semester i want to i
179:36 - don't want to work at a warehouse
179:37 - anymore
179:37 - probably do like some freelancing so i
179:39 - could focus more on school
179:41 - because i have like a sponsorship right
179:42 - now for school so
179:44 - well i just need sponsorship from where
179:46 - sponsorship from where
179:47 - oh i have uh i have someone from my um
179:51 - because i'm muslim so like there's a man
179:53 - at my masjid and my musk was trying to
179:55 - sponsor me for school
179:57 - so uh but i need time
180:00 - like to study so i don't want to like
180:02 - spend because i work eight hours so i
180:03 - don't want to do that anymore
180:05 - so i've been i've been studying on my
180:07 - own i
180:08 - i think i'm pretty good at html and css
180:11 - but like the javascript is just giving
180:12 - me like a little bit yeah
180:13 - this is this is and then it's okay so
180:16 - okay awesome
180:16 - so what's your question what do you want
180:18 - to know so first of all is like this
180:20 - homeworks
180:21 - like so according to what uh
180:24 - is it cassie was saying yeah like all we
180:27 - just have to do is change the the
180:29 - picture and
180:29 - um and uh and and like the skill right
180:34 - yeah the skills and the picture and any
180:35 - other information that pertain more so
180:37 - to you
180:38 - oh okay and another thing is like
180:42 - with this with this five because i'm
180:44 - just trying to get some practice in
180:46 - okay you know maybe maybe see if i could
180:48 - understand javascript more because
180:50 - i'm currently learning from like a book
180:52 - okay this book right here it's not a bad
180:54 - book actually
180:55 - yeah like it's it's pretty good and but
180:58 - but it's boring i
180:59 - i'm kind of and another thing is i'm
181:01 - kind of scared like
181:02 - i don't know should i say scared or i'm
181:05 - like maybe when i'm done i might not
181:07 - be there or when i'm done with the book
181:09 - because i already finished up to like
181:11 - almost 400 pages
181:12 - but then it's like i don't know i'm
181:15 - trying to get some practice in with you
181:17 - guys so
181:17 - i don't know do you think i'm gonna be
181:21 - like okay with this by
181:24 - by this five days like if i put into
181:26 - work and then get some practice in or
181:28 - let me ask this question right so it's
181:31 - what you're looking for is just
181:32 - permission
181:34 - right do you believe that you'll
181:37 - you'll learn or that you will be okay
181:42 - uh that's the thing i don't know i think
181:46 - i think if i put in more work
181:48 - like if i put in a lot of work yeah like
181:51 - nothing is impossible of course there
181:53 - you go there's your answer
181:55 - does your answer there really my friend
181:57 - yes at the end these five days
181:58 - you will have three projects all they're
182:00 - going to use html css
182:02 - and javascript and so yes of course
182:04 - you'll be a lot better
182:05 - but it doesn't stop there right well a
182:08 - lot you got a lot of you guys need to
182:09 - understand is it's
182:10 - is that you cannot um
182:14 - you cannot rely on html css
182:18 - somebody calling what is this what's the
182:20 - name
182:22 - that's not me it's not you okay
182:27 - at the time please record your message
182:28 - and if that's recording press one for
182:30 - more options
182:32 - so um but yeah i think
182:37 - html css should not be your focus right
182:39 - now
182:41 - yeah i know that's what i'm saying like
182:42 - javascript is where i'm having like
182:44 - problems so i'm guessing if i could like
182:46 - get some things
182:48 - from this 5d well yes of course plus did
182:51 - you get the free course that we have
182:53 - if you when you join or no uh
182:56 - no so we basically when you join we get
182:59 - a
182:59 - you get a 11-hour course that that's
183:01 - that's part of it as well
183:03 - right so if you don't i think are you in
183:05 - our texting community
183:07 - uh texan yeah i think i got a message
183:10 - from you get a message
183:12 - okay awesome so make sure there and just
183:14 - say hey can i get the course as well
183:16 - um okay my most important thing for you
183:18 - guys is going to be the following
183:21 - you you need to take every single
183:24 - project that we currently give you
183:26 - and modify it and then learn how to
183:29 - modify it right
183:31 - right your yes you'll build three
183:33 - projects but it's not gonna stop there
183:34 - that's not the only thing you need to do
183:36 - then you need to go back and learn the
183:38 - fundamentals and start doing projects
183:40 - for yourself
183:41 - so one of the biggest things that i
183:42 - think you can do after this korean boot
183:44 - camp
183:45 - right is actually going to be to is
183:48 - actually going to be hey
183:49 - you know what um let me think of a
183:52 - project
183:52 - that i can build by myself like what's a
183:56 - project that can help other people that
183:58 - you have always wanted to do
183:59 - any idea potentially have
184:05 - i mean i was thinking of getting like a
184:06 - website for my barber i just for who

185:02 - and then you told him to like pause for
185:04 - a little bit and then
185:05 - focus more on this five-day coding
185:07 - bootcamp is that is that the 11-hour
185:09 - course you were talking yeah that's the
185:10 - one i was talking about yeah

185:31 - forgot his name
185:33 - uh sunny um yeah sunny i watch his
185:35 - videos as well i don't
185:37 - put along but usually like when i'm at
185:39 - work i'm just thinking about it and just
185:40 - watching these videos
185:41 - well i want to make sure guys don't it's
185:43 - not just about the watching just
185:44 - co actually do code along okay very
185:46 - important no matter who you're watching
185:48 - him or us or any other channel
185:51 - code along right because you can't drive
185:54 - a car but listening how to drive a car
185:58 - you can't learn how to drive a car if
185:59 - you just listen if somebody tells you
186:01 - okay now
186:01 - you gotta turn the wheel you know to
186:03 - left like it doesn't work that way
186:05 - you know like that's because i'm
186:07 - focusing more on the book
186:08 - and i just watch that while i'm at work
186:10 - or something just to
186:11 - engage my mind but you know i don't want
186:14 - to be all around the place like
186:16 - that's good that's good that's good too
186:18 - so if you're focusing on that book then
186:19 - focus on the book yeah if
186:20 - that's good too i see what you mean if
186:22 - you're focused on the book then yeah
186:23 - focus on the book and then of course
186:25 - you know you can sway a little bit for
186:27 - example if you're on this five-day
186:28 - coding bootcamp where you're learning
186:29 - javascript html css
186:31 - it's a good avenue because you're now
186:32 - going way too far i lost the book right
186:34 - now i'm gonna i'm gonna put the book

196:14 - wait aren't you charles wait wait that's
196:17 - robbie never mind robbie hi
196:18 - hi robbie hey how's it going uh i'm from
196:21 - florida
196:22 - uh i have a just a couple quick
196:24 - questions about the uh
196:25 - the eighth month uh boot camp okay um
196:29 - eight months is obviously a lot of time
196:31 - yes uh it's six to eight months
196:33 - okay cool is that something that you
196:35 - need to like dedicate like
196:37 - full-time hours to like go to is it like
196:39 - a 40-hour kind of week kind of thing how
196:41 - does it work
196:41 - so uh for the for that one basically no
196:43 - you don't you do not need to dedicate
196:45 - uh 40 hours uh actually about 80 of our
196:48 - current students have a full-time job
196:50 - and so you probably will be dedicated
196:53 - time basically about 20 hours of work a
196:55 - week
196:55 - and it's mostly time after your work so
196:58 - do you currently have a full-time job
196:59 - right now
197:00 - yeah i work full-time and i'm i'm
197:02 - technically working now
197:03 - you're working where what's your current
197:05 - job i do tech support
197:07 - tax support oh yeah okay i remember that
197:08 - yeah that's right um so
197:10 - yeah like for example for example our
197:11 - coaching calls that in this the
197:14 - the six to eight months boot camp the
197:16 - goal is for students
197:17 - who are people who currently have have a
197:19 - job right so the goal for that will be
197:22 - you'll be joining coaching calls after 5
197:24 - pm pst
197:25 - which what time zone are you in eastern
197:27 - eastern so your time will actually be 8
197:29 - p.m
197:30 - okay and it's about like you'll be
197:32 - having around four coaching calls a week
197:34 - okay okay okay does that make sense yeah
197:37 - that makes sense my only other question
197:38 - was i see that there is financing
197:39 - available which is fantastic
197:41 - do you guys also take like fafsa or any
197:43 - kind of federal aid
197:44 - we don't do unfortunately we don't i
197:46 - wish we did
197:47 - you know but no boot camp is able to do
197:49 - that because they're not like university
197:51 - you know
197:51 - for the university so uh we just kind of
197:54 - you know
197:54 - we just kind of teach you the things

200:04 - in in your courses unless you evaluate
200:07 - all the courses
200:08 - really yes and to evaluate all the
200:10 - courses it takes a lot a lot a lot of
200:13 - time
200:13 - wow that's crazy i like like like
200:16 - imagine you're registered for eight
200:17 - courses and you have to evaluate
200:19 - all the courses too to see your grades
200:22 - that's not fair yeah that's crazy i i i
200:26 - made a tool
200:27 - uh that that makes you evaluate all the
200:30 - courses in like seconds
200:32 - like if you if you don't like the course
200:33 - you you registered just like but
200:36 - number one and the javascript will
200:39 - evaluate all the courses
200:40 - when the instructors know i know about
200:43 - it
200:43 - they said what did you do what did you
200:45 - do with the with the system
200:47 - i didn't do anything the chrome just did
200:50 - google chrome
200:53 - that's funny they thought like i i just
200:56 - want to know what what's my level um i
200:59 - i did i did i did like five
201:02 - to six to six to six projects um
201:06 - one of the one with john so look your
201:08 - level your level is still junior
201:10 - level but you're on a good junior level
201:11 - so you're a good junior level developer
201:13 - right now
201:14 - you'll become more advanced as you
201:16 - actually work at a company
201:19 - okay okay great okay got it so right now
201:21 - you're junior level but you've got some
201:23 - really solid knowledge
201:24 - and so for you getting the job we
201:25 - wouldn't be that bad
201:29 - uh okay uh i'm uh i'm a computer science
201:31 - undergraduate i
201:32 - uh i still have like one year until i
201:35 - graduate
201:36 - okay that's fine that's fine yeah that's
201:38 - fine i mean just keep searching for job
201:40 - and so forth okay
201:44 - okay great like uh if i
201:48 - if i go on with your course like the
201:50 - eight months the eight months
201:52 - course i'm in lebanon um how can i get
201:56 - how can i benefit from it like of course
201:59 - it can benefit
202:00 - i can benefit a lot from its knowledge
202:02 - but
202:04 - how can i get like jobs abroad abroad
202:07 - well okay so for one thing is abroad
202:10 - jobs
202:10 - is is i know for example you know it
202:12 - might be harder for you for example
202:14 - because you're in different country
202:14 - right
202:15 - here's what i'll tell you though right
202:17 - is nowadays because
202:19 - because of the internet right because of
202:22 - what you know it's really just
202:24 - comes down to your skills right a lot of
202:26 - companies are searching for remote work
202:28 - you know and even for example right now
202:30 - temporarily you try to do freelance work
202:32 - which you still can
202:33 - right no matter where you're from you
202:35 - can find those jobs
202:37 - you see what i mean and for there are a
202:39 - lot of companies who are just hiring you
202:40 - know
202:41 - outside outside for example people
202:43 - people you know
202:44 - uh you know from other countries right
202:47 - doesn't really matter as long as you
202:48 - have good skills
202:50 - but i i know it's i know unfortunately
202:53 - the way
202:53 - the world is is it is harder for those
202:56 - who are outside
202:57 - like us or outside you know these these
202:59 - countries
203:00 - and i totally get it and i wish it was
203:01 - different um
203:04 - i think in your terms it's just going to
203:05 - be basically you trying even harder
203:07 - to get those to get jobs as freelancing
203:09 - jobs just to get jobs even in
203:12 - either in your country or to get jobs
203:14 - that are remote work
203:15 - you know in other countries does that
203:17 - make sense
203:19 - yes should i focus a lot like on
203:21 - linkedin yes of course focus on linkedin
203:24 - most importantly focus on building your
203:25 - skills
203:27 - on building my skills and do you think i
203:29 - should go through a tutorial once and
203:32 - i should go i should go on my own yeah
203:35 - the building projects
203:36 - 100 100 building projects and then at
203:39 - that point start doing linkedin
203:40 - and then you should be doing like some
203:42 - freelance work right now as well
203:44 - create a uh create your own portfolio on
203:46 - freelancer
203:47 - or somewhere else and start start doing
203:50 - a work through there

206:19 - wow man this cp team
206:22 - is so awesome the whole team rafi sonny
206:25 - all y'all
206:26 - but what's cool um
206:29 - i learned the um algorithms back in the
206:34 - early the early 1980s from a book called
206:37 - c brian kernerjee and dennis ritchie
206:40 - okay you learned uh linked lists um the
206:43 - bubble sort
206:44 - oh the good stuff huh
206:48 - so i've been out of programming then i
206:50 - got into basic
206:51 - i made the pac-man game in 1983.
206:54 - nice i love it uh-huh right then i got
206:57 - no hardware
206:58 - i was doing i'm right now fix computers
207:00 - right now
207:01 - but um i've been doing javascript
207:03 - websites for
207:04 - 20 years whoa a lot
207:08 - right i mean from the php to the asp
207:11 - to java um uh my sql database
207:16 - but the question was concerning
207:19 - databasing
207:20 - i've watched you and um sonny and y'all
207:23 - um
207:24 - uh qazi on the back end using firebase i
207:27 - heard about
207:28 - google firebase well actually um i got
207:32 - an
207:32 - angular a little while ago but i got out
207:34 - of angular it was too
207:35 - too hectic at the angular angle okay
207:38 - okay
207:39 - but when i seen you what guys um do
207:41 - react i fell in love with react
207:44 - nice because i'm a job a javascript neck
207:47 - i like nice but for the databasing
207:51 - um could you recommend or not i mean not
207:54 - recommend the mongodb
207:57 - on the back end and also what about the
208:00 - um node server with um
208:01 - express is that relevant right now
208:05 - because i see you build
208:07 - some sites without node and express
208:10 - and uh mongodb i mean i guess firebase
208:14 - has everything right for the back end
208:16 - backing packing services right
208:18 - yeah well let me ask that question
208:21 - really simple
208:22 - yeah mongodb and node are very very
208:25 - popular languages and frameworks and you
208:27 - should learn them
208:28 - period right yep we use fibers because
208:31 - it's also very easy
208:32 - right and it's very simple and it gets
208:34 - the point across but like it or not
208:36 - mongodb and you know mongodb and for
208:39 - example
208:40 - and node.js if you look at indeed.com if
208:42 - you look at the jobs and what they're
208:44 - looking for
208:44 - they're still one of the most popular
208:46 - jobs like they still very much need it
208:49 - wow great great great great got it
208:52 - and where are you from dave where you
208:53 - from by the way i'm not from um d.c
208:56 - oh dc washington d.c nice next
208:59 - connections capital
209:00 - right very nice and one other quick
209:01 - question um um

209:18 - days
209:19 - so on sunday you guys will get the
209:20 - chance to enroll and apply okay great
209:23 - there's an application process and then
209:24 - we go through the application process
209:26 - and we see
209:26 - you know not everybody gets in right
209:30 - but we go to the application process and
209:32 - basically and then we we see kind of
209:34 - how you guys do and so forth and then
209:36 - and then we kind of let you uh come in
209:39 - okay great great sounds good sounds
209:41 - great okay awesome my friend okay cool
209:43 - and then
209:43 - so what do you currently have a job or
209:45 - you currently work or not right now i
209:47 - got my own business i do computer
209:49 - i'm an it net where i do computer
209:51 - repairs
209:52 - nice i build websites i mean basic
209:55 - websites i mean many front end
209:57 - not not too much back in but you know um
210:00 - and that's basically it you know nice
210:02 - and what and what and what's your goal
210:03 - and what's your
210:04 - goal with what's your goal with coding i
210:07 - guess
210:07 - or with full stack development well
210:10 - basically i'm trying to get into react
210:12 - so i can do the four stack but um
210:14 - eventually i want to get into mobile
210:17 - app development nice i did start off
210:20 - with native script
210:21 - but if you know about uh a native script
210:24 - um mobile app development
210:25 - it's kind of like a hybrid similar to
210:28 - react native and everything right
210:29 - a lot of javascript mm-hmm i gotcha i
210:32 - know
210:32 - i was talking about okay right right so
210:34 - i guess i'm trying to get into mobile
210:36 - app development
210:37 - probably by next by 2022.
210:41 - okay okay dang that's awesome that's
210:43 - awesome i mean yeah there's
210:45 - this world is very much is going very
210:47 - high
210:48 - on the mobile development side and
210:50 - there's a lot of demand for it as well
210:53 - now with the mobile apps um you know
210:56 - there's two platforms apple and
210:58 - android yes and on one side you have
211:00 - java
211:01 - that is what it is swift right right
211:04 - right swift right
211:05 - but what about the react native it's
211:07 - more of a hybrid
211:09 - between both of them so react react
211:11 - native react natively uses javascript
211:14 - to basically create both for both
211:16 - android and for ios
211:18 - so yes right now there's a lot of
211:20 - possibilities around it for example
211:22 - there's other applications that are
211:23 - actually built with react native like i
211:24 - don't know if you guys know but the
211:26 - tesla
211:26 - application which i even have on my side
211:28 - right that itself is like built with
211:30 - react native
211:32 - wow yeah amazing amazing
211:35 - yeah so so definitely definitely look uh
211:38 - look into that one
211:39 - and then um there's just there's a lot
211:40 - of possibilities and it's because josh
211:43 - is becoming so
211:44 - so so much more um popular
211:47 - right it's getting a lot a lot stronger
211:50 - as well
211:51 - and so that actually allows us that
211:52 - allows these these
211:54 - you know you know uh what's it called
211:56 - devices to actually run them and so at
211:58 - some point
211:59 - i definitely foresee a future where all
212:01 - your apps are actually built in
212:02 - javascript
212:03 - right i mean a javascript is everywhere
212:05 - i mean anytime you have a web it's
212:07 - everywhere
212:08 - yeah exactly exactly right so and one
212:10 - last question i guess your course
212:12 - i missed your course last year i was
212:13 - very busy the profit with javascript
212:16 - okay
212:17 - i mean it's um that course are still
212:20 - available
212:21 - is it what the javascript yeah it's
212:23 - still available it's still available 100
212:26 - so how can we find um i found that link

213:47 - well
213:49 - that really depends on like what you're
213:50 - looking for so i think in your case
213:53 - it will actually be for example it'll
213:56 - just be contacting companies honestly
213:58 - like content companies like for example
214:01 - content companies and there's it just
214:03 - asks

Cleaned transcript:

and this is kazi and this is your day one of the boot camp guys they won the boot camp so excited to have you here we are going to be talking about the opportunity to become uh a developer in 2021 we've got there's plenty of opportunity if you're looking to make the career switch and you're thinking about becoming a developer now is the time because it's never been better to become a developer as the world is shifting into development as we go forward so tune in there's going to be a lot of value for you here and with that said what do we got now should we jump in let's jump in let's go ahead and have your screen share what you got and then we'll be able to see everybody okay awesome sweet let's go ahead all right guys so let's go here and uh just want to make sure you guys are able to see this clearly right day one your opportunity to become a developer you guys can all see this yep beautiful yeah let's start let's start rocking and rolling in that case all right hopefully you guys are ready i am um and let's go so a couple of things that i want you guys to do here that are on please guys it's time to focus so do me a favor and for now everybody just mute yourselves just because we don't want any sounds coming in and distracting anybody else that's actually trying to learn thank you guys who've brought a notebook or something to write with if you want to just go quickly grab something to write with preferably if it's you know paper it's going to be better so for example ron fernandez and john velasco you guys got notebooks something to write with that's great that way you're not going to get distracted if you're using your phone yeah um so just make sure put your phone and do not disturb have something to write with this is the time to do that and just to let you guys know this is the five day boot camp for those of you who are currently on youtube if you want to join the five day bootcamp the link is down below we have an amazing community as you can see right now that's uh that's on here on the facebook group and everybody's going to join in help each other out and are there here to kickstart their careers developers and actually just learn and just have a lot of fun yes absolutely and just so you guys know what's coming up ahead today i'm just going to show it real quick for you guys so um that's weird i don't know why my yeah click on the click on the what's it called the three buttons that the uh it's on your keyboard you see that it's up top near the brightness to the right weird all good all good okay so let's let's keep going i don't know why that didn't work that's odd but mainly the main things we're we're going to be covering okay i'm just going to draw it with this it's going to look crappier but that's okay it's going to get the point across so um basically one thing we're going to be discussing today is the agenda that we have for you over the next coming days okay excuse my handwriting it looks like a fiveyearold whatever um okay so we're gonna talk about what what's the agenda what are we gonna be covering in the next five days okay because the next five days are going to be really intense and so today we're going to talk about the opportunity starting tomorrow you're going to start building projects with javascript okay so day two we're going to build a startup landing page day three what are we going to build now day three we are good game which is going to be a lot of fun and then finally day four we're going to build a sas product business kind of like you know that you know like a lot of sas products like indeed.com and so forth and so we'll be able to build that together with with javascript yeah for example a product a slack is a sas product discord is a sas product so you need when you work at those companies you need to know how to build those types of landing pages that's what you're gonna get paid for so we're gonna be doing that on day two three and four so it's gonna be a lot of coding and um it's gonna get more intense okay but even if you're a beginner it's all good we're gonna give you all the resources and help you need okay another important thing for you guys to know if you listen to this and you guys pay attention you work hard and you submit your portfolios or the homework that we ask of you nas and i are personally going to take our time or people from our team are personally going to take their time and we're also going to give you video feedback and video review okay not every single person is going to get that so just be aware of that guys we're a very small team okay so it takes time and effort so if some of you we too please don't be upset about that but we'll try to do our best to get to as many people as possible does that make sense we do our best guys honestly so yeah just be patient with us right but the same time just also help the other community as well be nice to the community let's make sure that we have clean comments in you know this whole uh five day boot camp and let's make sure that we just you know communicate connect if you're like working hard you're engaging you're active we see you working hard even on calls like if i see you're actually paying attention and doing all this stuff we want to take and review your projects does that make sense okay so people who are participating really well we want to give you feedback if you don't care and you're like disengaged you're not participating in the community you don't even have your camera on then when you're working you're kind of we're not going to review your projects okay so those are a couple of things to understand uh we're going to talk about the opportunity that exists for developers because that's something really important and we want you guys to be able to see that um within this opportunity of course we're going to talk to you about what technologies you need to learn okay so should you be learning javascript should you be learning react first should you be learning mongodb so what types of things should be learning okay and also like what types of job opportunities and how how much salary is paid for those all right and then uh lastly one of the things we're going to talk about is um of course your roadmap okay so we're going to kind of build your personal plan of attack for becoming a developer and then at the end we're going to go over homework okay so this is just a rough outline of what we're going to be covering cool awesome so that's sweet can you show this like can you show the slides my friend uh yes you and there we go there we go all right so quick question guys who would like a free portfolio to put all of the projects that you're going to be building here in the next five days okay just a raise of hands if this is something that's exciting for you beautiful beautiful anna's excited give that to me nice so yeah we're gonna give you a full portfolio for this and give you all access to it okay so simply you can just click it and copy it it's yours all right and then we have prizes too depending on the participation and the level of effort and work you guys are putting in so we're gonna have one lucky winner who's going to win our coding boot camp full stack mastery okay so there's gonna be one person that wins that it's an eight month long program where if you think you're going to get value in five days you know imagine the value you'd get in eight months working with with me my team and uh what we're gonna offer you is going to be absolutely bananas and then number two and three you get access to our courses okay so uh if you guys want to connect with us on social media on instagram you guys can uh tag us all right at cleverkozy and we'd be happy to repost um all of your stuff okay so this is what it is or you can tag nas or jesse these are the three cool all right so let's keep moving um this wouldn't happen guys without a big team that we have so please give a moment of like a little golf clap okay you don't have to do a crazy clump a little crosstalk for the whole team because they do put in a lot of effort and hard work and without this amazing team this wouldn't be possible yeah there's a lot that goes behind the scenes that sometimes you guys don't see honestly and so yeah to make it happen everybody's working really really hard and you and just let you guys know you will probably be contacted by one of these team members right to engage right to go ahead and give you feedback on your project so so let you know between everybody on here you will probably contacted by them okay yeah redian nice to see you here hopefully your youtube videos are doing well all right let's keep going um so here are your instructors okay this is me i'm quasi the guy drinking the coffee here um you know i hate to say any of this because it sounds douchey but um i i work really really hard and i figured out how to be making a hundred thousand dollar a year income while i was going to college and i was doing that from development working remotely at this point i've had the privilege to teach lots and lots of students i mean you know just to give you guys a little bit i started because i was like really dumb and coding was really hard for me to learn and i was like failing math classes and the way that instructors taught me just didn't work for me at all so i'm like screw this and i started learning it in my own way and started getting mentorship to learn it in my own way and then i started getting good picking up the skills and i was just obsessed with coding so i was coding like 10 to 15 hours a day and then within like three to six months i started actually working with clients and landing clients but a lot of it came from obsession and i just want to emphasize the amount of hard work and uh you know not really you know i'm smart but i'm not that smart i just work really really freaking hard so that's that's where i make it up uh so you know now we have a youtube channel that's almost about to hit a million subscribers i'm super excited about and i want to just take all of the things that we're learning and i want to share that with you guys is that okay with you guys is that cool can i get a hands up for that yeah everybody beautiful here is my my friend nas hey hey how's it going guys this is nas and of course me some of you might know me as the instructor at you know multiple courses you know i'm on youtube as well but just in general kind of came from ukraine originally you know and uh have been they have given the chance to interview at many different companies around google to volunteer to twitter and so forth and at this point i've been coding for the last probably 10 years at this point right start off coding when i was in high school and kind of moved up to then you know go to college of course and i moved up to then uh you know work at different companies big companies small companies and now here i am teaching you guys how to do the same yeah i mean guys it's really a blessing to have a person like nas working alongside you he's one of the best problem solvers and thinkers i've ever come across in the world of software development and i know many developers i have friends who are like you know work the smartest people working at google working on some of the hardest problems and even with that i say what i say about nas so it's it's it's amazing to have him on here we're lucky to have him on this team and if you guys are here and you're participating really take value out of everything he's saying okay guys cool all right let's keep going awesome jessie she's an amazing instructor she's also going to be part of this uh boot camp you guys are going to see her on day two three and four and she's an amazing instructor for our coding bootcamp that we have and just to share with you guys right also for you guys to start making the connections like depending on what jobs you guys are currently doing and and maybe just drop it in the chat below as well what types of jobs are you guys doing okay so like what's your current but think about from her perspective right she was doing uh tax law that has nothing to do with software development yeah she was able to make that switch so if you're thinking about switching your career and going from your current job to a new job it's possible for you okay and she also loves coffee and uh anime i like anime too anybody else here likes anime i've never been i've never been a big fan of some reason yeah we should have a lot of people so we have people who are doing lots of uh wow brilliant i love anime nice i know death note i watched uh uh attack on titan that was a lot of fun big naruto fan awesome ending all right so now let's take a look at what you guys are going to be building so i apologize guys because we have so much information and value we want to share we're probably going to be going at a little faster pace is that cool with you guys okay we're going to be kind of like going fast all right so so have your if you guys want to screenshot it with your computer or just take notes just be prepared to go fast and stay on pace because there might be some slides you see that we're just going to keep going faster through them okay so one project you guys are going to be building is a startup landing page that's going to be worth 10k or more you guys are going to be building a rock paper scissors game using advanced javascript and you guys are going to be building a sas product with esx javascript okay so when i say sas product think of like you know what slack looks and feels like think of what discord looks and feels like okay so those are sas products that are successful so imagine basically building three project guys in these next five days and then putting them on your portfolio to be able to showcase to you know uh potential employers potential you know uh you know maybe freelancing projects and so forth yeah there's a lot of opportunity we're gonna have a lot of fun as well yeah and the job of projects that go on your portfolio is get recruiters attention that's pretty much the number one job of your portfolio then once they bring you in the rest is up to them okay but that gets you most of the times in the door and gets you we want to help you with okay and this is our goal is that your portfolio looks great okay so for example here's a portfolio one of our students he has instagram clone built a blogging app built he has multiple different projects that he's built this is actually david yeah who who was one of our students yeah and now he's working with us all right um so now the question is hopefully you guys are ready to to get going and uh you know hopefully you guys are ready to bring it your all all right bring your a game bring your energy of course and bring attention guys and most importantly bring time into this okay these next five days are going to take up a lot of time so make sure you put a lot of effort into this because this is going to be probably the most one of the most important things you learn yeah and it matters right so everybody who's sitting there prepared like i see jessica simpson she's sitting in a good posture she has her pen it looks like she's going to take notes can it matters right so like actually being prepared for this and kind of bringing your heart and energy you're going to retain a lot of information if you're kicking back you're just like sleeping you're not at home or in a good spot you're not gonna take away a lot out of this okay so that's important for you to know i see back she's got her notebook already ready and she's somewhere in hawaii as well so that's pretty cool yeah i love that that's absolutely amazing okay so let's go boot campers and let's get going and thank you guys for doing so many amazing posts like the engagement was crazy insane in this challenge like all of you guys went absolutely bananas so you we had like ashley make a post and she's like hey i'm from london by the way any other people here from london or uk it's kind of cool but it seems like she's complaining like hey it's university and things like that like the way that she was learning is boring do any of you guys resonate with that has like boring instructors or you just fi found learning boring i've i've had instructors who literally just go to like you know presentation just read off presentation literally and that's literally all they do nothing else abigail you know albert albert lives in los angeles hey what's going on maybe when we're doing the challenge in person next month hopefully albert can join oh another uk student abigail that's awesome lucas is in virginia cool wesley and it just goes on and on like you guys went absolutely crazy just know that we love your engagement we're reading all the comments we're doing our best to reply to almost all of you okay so it really that connection to us really matters yeah and keep the engagement up guys very very important okay this is how you connect with other people and it's also how we connect with you yep absolutely so this is the plan for the next five days day one today we're gonna talk about your opportunity to become a developer day two we're gonna build that landing page day three we're gonna build a game with javascript day four we're gonna work on the sas product and then day five we're gonna build your ultimate developer roadmap to become a full stack developer so what that basically means is we're going to give you all the technology all the tools you need so you're not learning like a million different things that are not actually helping you in your career cool and uh today we're going to be making making sure that you learn the opportunity and we're gonna kind of unravel some of the myths around becoming a developer okay so let's deep dive into building your personal roadmap all right let's see and what what we want to do is let's actually figure out why you want to become a developer because that's a good question that's because a lot of people you know you know think about this and actually they go into this for the wrong reason that's something that we see a lot a lot in people yes so here's what we want you guys to write down in the zoom chat right now what are three things that are actually more important to you than money yeah all right if you want to succeed in becoming a developer this is really the only way where you know what is more important to you than money because if that's the only reason you're doing it then that's you're not going to actually go really far with it okay so i want to start seeing what are your guys's three reasons so we have alex sanderson says knowledge stability and family memory says stability having fun family friends and health immanuel is helping people with technology charles says skill education and travel i like that that's really good set my own schedule build cool stuff rajesh's knowledge individuality jessica simon says creativity these are absolutely incredible answers wow happiness awesome family family helping my family wow okay so you guys are starting to see the trend with the other people hopefully maybe you're seeing it resonate a little bit with you as well but family is definitely an important thing that that a lot of you guys are saying learning the skill is important to you it seems like and of course the opportunity to have freedom and kind of you know either choose your own schedule or be or work from wherever you want okay so those are a couple of things you guys said none of them are wrong it's just what is important to you okay so remember those three things you said because you're gonna that's going to help craft what type of role you look for when you're becoming a developer okay and now let's maybe just talk about what can making money as a developer help you achieve in your life okay so quickly just give me if you were making a decent amount of money what can that help you do more okay what can that help you with in your life buy a house stability education uh give my daughter oh it's moving so fast i love this pay off debt oh wow there's so much insane help my daughter with school pay your student loans i love that give my wife and son a good life and for those of you on youtube as well make sure you guys to comment that down below as well i'm really curious to see what you guys are saying too rediane just wants to buy cars nothing wrong with that either house and travel i love that travel is not a bad thing nothing's wrong with that guys no judgment here so that's totally okay give mother a good life that's pretty cool i like that satisfaction discover the world that's right my girlfriend why do you need money to marry your girlfriend i mean you know weddings are not cheap okay fair enough i love this so this is this is really good because i want you guys to know what's important to you because you need three reasons why you're gonna code even if you didn't get paid right and then it's also good to know why you need the money if you did get if you were making money getting paid to code okay so that's absolutely great now let's quickly figure out your income goals as we keep going okay so how much income do you want to make per month all right so the reason why i ask this question is it determines a lot like for example maybe some of you might not need to make that much money some some of you may be happy with making two thousand dollars a month and what that might allow you to do is code parttime work remotely be a freelancer or some of you might be like hey i want to be making five seven thousand ten thousand dollars a month and i wanna be working at a big company and i'm okay working 40 hours a week and i'm okay there none of those are wrong okay because you can learn a lot from working at big companies and working fulltime so what is your income goal that's important for you to know yeah and it's 12k a month wow eight to 10k 5k 10k a month 10k a month 2k 75k a month holy molly 75k a year right okay somebody said 20k a month these are some good numbers yeah just don't don't be unrealistic guys right you know don't say it like you know i want to make a million a month right it's very important i've had people say that right so want to be realistic with it as well yeah yeah he's not saying don't be optimistic yeah it means be realistic because you can't take 20 steps on a la you know at once you kind of go you got to go to level one level two so if you can prove you can make a hundred dollars with coding then yes you're more likely to then make a thousand dollars a month with coding okay so a lot of you i saw 5k 10k a month that's that's a pretty good range to be thinking about all right and then the last thing you know we want to ask you guys is are you you know do you want to do freelancing with with development or do you see more working fulltime okay so freelancing just party at the bottom i love that so yeah i mean both again both are really really good both are solid we just decided to put like random funny photos here but which one do you want to do fulltime fulltime fulltime so which one you you did guys which one did you do we should almost have a poll for that that's actually cool um what i did actually mostly freelancing with with software development personally yeah i mean i did full time i did freelancing but i kind of did both right though i know personally i mean i did enjoy both myself right um yeah i don't know i think it's really cool to experience you know the freelancer side and the fulltime side and then you kind of kind of see which which side is for you because i'll be honest with you you know not eat not like freelancing might not be your thing or fulltime might not be your thing you know right yeah so it's definitely good cool to experience both because with freelancing for example you have to deal with a lot more instability not knowing when you're going to have work next and a lot of those things right with full time you have job security you don't have to worry about where you're going to get work from or paid from next month but freelancing if you were working on one type of project you didn't like it you can quickly pick another client and work on a completely different thing tomorrow so again both are both are good personally i think that if you could get into full time my recommendation would be to try to break into full time just because you're gonna learn so freaking much and you will get mentorship there you will have some other developers that can teach you so from just a skill perspective charles like for example how you said number one is skill for you right just from a skill perspective alone it's killer opportunity where you can pick up so much all right so again web developer growth is a lot right so why it depends which which one you want to get into but we like talking about web development because because it's it is a faster growing than almost any other industry because even for example think of somebody that wants to do data science right maybe they're just like in this 12 growth that they're doing data science even they at some point need to learn web development because then somebody needs to take that data and those and those graphs and put them online right like it can't just live on a freaking pdf what are you gonna print it out you know so like even when stack overflow comes up with your service somebody needs to actually visualize those graphs and put them on the web so at some point that same data scientist is going to need some web development skills so why we like web development a lot is you can become a web developer or you can break out into other into other verticals like data science and still be still be great does that make sense guys okay and when i say data science just so everybody has an understanding i'm talking about like ai type of stuff right so there's the web development world and then there's the ai world okay so for example selfdriving cars is ai selfcheckout that that's happening around the world is is ai so even if you wanted to do that i think it would serve you to have web development experience so let's keep going here and the opportunity for becoming a developer is a lot okay so a lot right now yeah and it's growing constantly and the amount of um students that a computer science you know universities are able to pump out it's about like 400 000 per year but the demand is about 1.4 million or more jobs which means that the amount of students is not meeting the needs for the overall jobs and so what happens it will happen is when you have more demand than supply what do what what do you think guys what happens usually when there's more demand versus supply what happens very simple what happens is higher pay exactly right so a lot of people that this is where basically the the income increases keeps increasing keeps increasing and we'll see later on that over the years the income has increased you know and for developer jobs you know what i mean yeah so you know even if you want to start off with maybe let's say you want to do software development but then maybe later you can think about launching your own company like a sas product or something like that right damn zach got excited about that i see that's what zac is on nice so if your goal is that that's totally great because it plays out in the long run because most of the world is moving towards technology right so even if it's not tomorrow or next year or in three years how about in the next seven years 10 years because software development isn't going anywhere and for you to know this is a skill and even if you had people working under you if you knew the skill of software development you could make better hires that then work on your software okay so those are a couple of things to keep in mind it doesn't always mean you're permanently just going to be an employee even though that's pretty freaking great okay so there's a big gap and uh you know i don't know if we have those slides here but let's keep going and a lot of you know even here by definition you can't have a million more people here that are getting these degrees but they're still getting jobs which by definition means that majority of the people without degrees are actually getting software developer jobs and this is where a lot of companies sound to realize that right that it takes a long time for people to get through a degree and so a lot of people companies are starting to remove then yes the necessity for a degree instead of like basically looking more so at your experience right and what you can do and just in general just do you know how to code right or have you have you built projects and not necessarily just just like what you know from a degree that's it it's a game of skill yeah software development is a game of skill just like charles like you uh you you stream apex right you play a video game that's a game of skill if you were to join a league nobody gives a crap about your certification or a degree that you might have they just see your skill level in the game now don't don't get me wrong if there's a data science job you're going to they probably might care about you having a degree but like even elon musk says i don't give a damn about your degree i actually care about your skill level as a software developer so with software development because there's so much new technology and new things happening all the time you most of the times just need to have a skill and a way to prove that you have that skill so either you could rely on an 80 000 piece of paper or you could rely on just good projects on your freaking portfolio that we're going to give you in this boot camp how does that sound okay it works all right so let's keep going um software engineer salaries in the us now on the left hand side right oh are those my drawings never went away can you remember honest yeah awesome okay cool cool so here you have javascript right 112 dollars a year salary and then you all have all these other languages and and all languages are great but they're for different things yeah we got ios as well after sign the android though ios they are higher paying there's a lot less demand for it right so for ios basically this is when you're talking about this you're talking about like developing for iphone yeah for like literally iphone apps and of course the developing android apps as well yeah so for example here the cool thing about web development it helps you branch out and it has principles that play out in every other industry yeah that is meaning that if you learn web development and you learn how to do how do i talk to my database how do i build a user interface how do i what what i'm good right you guys can hear me yeah you're good okay cool so if i do all that i can still apply in the future and like pick up iphone skills iphone development skills ios development skills okay i can still pick up python and learn data science and stuff like that so what's important for you to understand is you're not alienating any other opportunities when you start with web development as a matter of fact they are complementary and often needed when you jump into other fields it makes sense or here for example when you learn javascript right there's a lot of opportunity around right around you learn react native which is from javascript and then being able to build applications for ios and for android at the same time yeah yeah so let's keep going all right now remote work during covet has increased a lot how many people experience a lot of different types of things in their heads and in job in the world last year like was last year kind of tricky and difficult for you guys yeah raise your hand with together it was for me yeah it was a really everybody's like oh you're filled with turmoil and unexpected events and it's like what the heck is going on right i'm like can you please just return to normal come on yeah but one something that interesting that happened with it within that is things changed and i believe a lot of things changed permanently too so now companies were forced to start thinking about how to work with talent remotely and then they made that shift from going from physical offices often to remote offices and some of some huge companies liked it so much they want to keep things that way even yeah it makes it easier for everybody like they actually found that focus increases a lot and and their efficiency has increased a lot because there's so much more focus on just a doing portion instead of doing a bunch of meetings so raise your hand raise your hand here guys i'm just curious who here loves to do remote work who here would love to do remote work everybody look at that look at that oh my god it just keeps going keeps going so the remote work portion just only increase and increase because really in the development world what do you need to do work what just your laptop pretty much is here nice hi nice to see you yeah and she would agree right like you need you preferably i'd like to have a monitor with my laptop okay preferably i'd have to have a nice setup when i'm coding so but even with that said you know you could work you can work i could have a nice setup at home as well so yeah a lot of what you need to do you are able to do it remotely i think you know for people it'll be always a split like sometimes i like to go into office to work sometimes i like to work from uh home what's more important is that i have the option of choosing both okay and what i want to share with you guys is that when you're doing development and you learn the skill you will have an option of choosing both okay that's one important thing to keep in mind so for those of you guys who are maybe doing stuff that's really hard takes all your time you're like man i just want to be with family more okay and i want to be either around my kids or around my girlfriend or wife whatever this gives you the opportunity to be able to do that or maybe you want to travel you know who knows yeah oh yeah now the world is opening up travel is the thing finally yeah yeah all right so let's now get into more like technical stuff as well right like for example why do we why why javascript why is this language actually helpful and why a couple of reasons all right first of all javascript is actually one of the most common and most used languages around the world for developers so you can see here on the left hand side all right it's one of the most powerful languages and and in a big picture perspective everything is from javascript okay so like if i just if i get out of here if i get out of this slide and i and i go to youtube you know all of this all of everything that you see here is javascript yeah i mean basically the whole the whole world wide web is built on javascript guys yeah when i click history or when i click this even when i hover my mouse and all this stuff is happening and what happens when i click live what happens when i click chess this is all javascript right when i go on instagram this isn't just like weird stuff that we're nerding out and talking about this is real stuff that's happening right now when i hit the play button there's a javascript video player that loads like literally every single thing that's online has javascript for those of you who are killing on zoom and you guys are watching this right and zoom through the web version of zoom that's also using javascript youtube you're watching on youtube what is that javascript guys right so that platoon that's a software somebody made and sold it to google for a billion dollars right and that software uses a lot of javascript so that's why these skills matter yeah all right so let's keep going and uh here is you know again another survey by stack overflow where javascript is clearly the number one and then for in terms of web frameworks and you guys should write this down as well if hopefully you're taking notes but in terms of learning frameworks we recommend that you learn react okay you don't have to learn it right away but put it on your roadmap to learning because it is hot right now and it's going to continue being hot and facebook started using it you guys saw facebook's ui change right like you guys saw facebook change a lot right where it used to kind of look like trash a few years ago now they did their ui update and looks cool and looks awesome they're using react and facebook actually created react for internal use and then they're like wait why don't we just open source this and they did and the whole world is like hey we want to start using react and then instagram jumped on it and a lot of other big companies are now jumping on it okay so a good one good tool to to learn about now another thing we want to touch base on is what can you actually do with javascript so top tech companies are using javascript so facebook linkedin microsoft ebay tesla groupon netflix all these companies have used or used javascript in some way or some shape okay and when it comes to types of web apps you can build here are the types of web apps you can actually build with javascript okay so on the left hand side you have facebook and that's built with javascript and react okay in the middle you have a server app which is you know netflix probably a lot by the way show of hands how many people here have a netflix account oh yeah probably everybody wow that's awesome that's super cool so netflix uses javascript okay and then even ios android apps use it to a certain extent so these are all types of things you can build with them okay and there are tons of myths of becoming a developer such as do i need to have a degree to get a job as a developer uh the answer is you know hold on let's see if uh i'm just gonna do stuff on the fly hopefully that's that's okay with you guys let's see uh if this video is there okay i'll let i'll let my my friend elon say some of this stuff now i do have to share it where i share my sound too um no no it's all good it's almost like you are you doing a road caster just stream it to world castle your sound should be on road caster that's it okay okay that's the one that's it no i don't hear your road caster sound i think you might have sound source on it bro college degree there we go now i can hear you the it's not it's it there's no need even to have a college degree okay at all or even high school the um i mean if somebody graduated from a great university that may be an indeed that may be an indication that they will be oh wait i can't show it for too long because copyright oh yeah yeah be careful oh yeah i remember it on the fly but i will share this part bill gates larry ellison steve jobs these guys didn't graduate from college but if you had a chance to hire them of course that would be a good idea i love that yeah yeah i love this guy so of course you know not everybody's bill gates or steve jobs or elon musk but also what's important to understand is that it's not always needed and elon is like elon is now the tony stark of real world right he's the real life iron man so when he does it sends it sets trends right like when apple and iphone does it sets trends when i apple is like hey now laptops are not going to have disk trays anymore disk trays are gone like no computer comes with that anymore right now apple is like usb c is the and then like android and everybody's like oh no offense to anybody who's using android here but like i'm sure things are gonna start changing to that direction right so when elon says things like that a lot of companies are like okay maybe there's different criteria we need to hire people on and maybe a boarding algorithm isn't the answer maybe we should look at their skills okay and maybe we should look past pieces of papers so a lot of modern tech companies that's what they do now okay so um yeah don't confuse schooling with education i like that and the coolest thing i think is to take away from this as well is like a lot of you guys think hey you know what nothing guys want certificates you want certificates you want to see certificates right oh nas i got an html set certificate you know i'm like great but do you have knowledge to actually build this kind of stuff right so what i think is we're trying to get from here is this it's not about degree a certificate it's about what you know and what you can do that's it yeah absolutely i didn't go to harvard but the people that work for me did um yeah yeah yeah so salary outlook you have a good salary outlook as we start to go into 2021 2022 average salaries for software developers is something that's increasing um you know but again the what this also means is as time progresses you also need to start developing a stronger and stronger skill level okay if you have a stronger skill level then you can be getting paid higher income okay but when you start as a junior developer and you're completely starting out it might be a little bit lower than this right but then you can work your way up to this okay and software engineer salaries at these are software engineers saw uh salaries at tesla and this is for entry level entrylevel people so literally beginners guys like if you're a beginner this is what what they're looking to give you biscuit if you look at those companies yeah so i'm just going to say that you have to there's you're still skilled and you're good at what you do and you know a lot of things if you don't know how to write code they're not going to give you the job but like if you're in a junior level developer this is actually what they will start you off with if they accept you yeah yeah yeah yeah cool so let's keep going you know uh your boy me uh i did drop out of college i was going i was going to college for two years and i was going to community college as well as saving money and then i was going to uic university of illinois in chicago i don't know if any of you guys have gone there anybody is from chicago at all um shout so shout out to chicago but my professor came up to me and i remember at that time i was already i had other developers even working for me and we were working for uh we were building this crm for a company and i was getting paid quite a bit you know um about like ten thousand dollars a month so i was on track to hit a hundred thousand dollars that year and my professor came up to me and he was like he started asking me for career advice and when he did that that was the cue for me and i was like okay maybe maybe this is the time to drop out of college and so i took one semester off and i was like if things don't work out i'll go back but then that's really when this started taking off and i just because i i was able to just go all in okay like can you focus your camera your camera's on focus for a second here okay there we go now you're good beautiful okay beautiful uh we have jesse who went from being a tax law consultant to a full stack developer and uh this is nasa's this is my friend yeah my friend robert and he's actually one of my first mentors and i actually literally met him by by going to a kuwaiti computing club and there he was actually building a startup company together with his friend steve and lilly joined him and he is now kind of he's built you can see trandala which was the starter company that was part of with them at the bottom and then he literally got a job at quickenload which is a work he's working right now and he's actually a lead developer there and he does not know how to have no degree he did go start going to college literally his first two years and then just dropped out he's like i don't need this so there you go yeah and this is what the career ladder looks like for you so if you want to become a software developer this is really what's happening you start off with being a junior software engineer or junior software developer that's your first title right your junior developer and then from there you go to a senior software developer third step up you become a lead developer where you're actually coordinating work within teams and sometimes you still write a code and sometimes you also become managers sometimes you either be a lead developer or you get to the managerial role technical architect where you're then actually focusing on designing systems here you become a team lead or a software development manager also what nas was talking about and here you're actually looking at projects and teams and you have power to hire and fire their developers and then the the final step is becoming a cto so that's a chief technology officer right so then you're actually managing the entire organization's technical needs and also from here you can either continue working at that company you'd go to different companies at higher paying jobs or if you wanted to it would also be a good time to maybe even look into developing something of your own because at this point you have tons of experience tons of knowledge okay all right now what's the first step that you should take what do you need to do to pass the interview how do you get noticed and so let's start actually going through and talking about these things okay before we we address all of those types of things cure is just one truth okay so for everybody who's a beginner and doesn't have a job right now as a software developer and doesn't have so much experience i want you guys to spend all your time learning the skills of coding it it takes a lot of time to really sharpen your skill set and actually get really really good at this but please spend majority of your time actually learning how to code all right just being competent in what you in what you guys in this field right right competency is what gives you confidence competency is what gives the opportunity now for those of you who don't know what competence is right because some of you guys might not know confidence is just you know the actual skill and you're being good at it because that's what people pay for my right yeah and confidence comes from competence okay so the more competent you are the more confident you are going to be you've probably experienced this in your life right when you guys are talking about a subject you don't know anything about you're like oh you have no idea what the hell to say but then if somebody's talking about things that you're good at or things you're passionate about all of a sudden your demeanor changes your posture changes the way your speaking changes you're like let me actually tell you how this is done and it's and it's not just random confidence that you just mustered out of nowhere it's because you're competing that skill you know what you're talking about okay so you know like i'm bad at construction and putting things together at diy stuff i'm like crap you know i'm garbage at that i'm like no don't talk to me somebody asked me a question i'm like oh i don't even know how to freaking tie a knot i don't know what's going on here but then like somebody wants to talk to me about chess and i'm super confident i'm like let me tell you about this you know everything changes and i'm talking about that yeah so because we we've had some people and without naming any names but where nas interviewed um you know interviewed uh her and she just didn't have any technical skills you know it was really really really bad like really bad and i think what happened in that case was like she had a great personality really high energy a wonderful person but i think the problem that happened was she'd heard that soft skills are really important and i think she kind of like went overboard with it meaning like she spent all her time making connections making relationships um meetings with people knowing everybody in the tech world interviewing sending hundreds of job offers but everybody that interviewed her just said that your technical skills are just not good yeah because like yeah i could hire somebody who's a great person but if your skills are just not there what am i hiring you for you know yeah like if that's that's that's the most important thing like like it or not and if you could combine both soft skills and technical skills this is where you become so in demand that people will literally throw money at you like there's literally companies that would that will fight for you i've had that happen from multiple companies where you know if you're really good and they really want you they'll just they'll just keep like okay we'll raise this up where is this up and like this is where you'll be able to get like big raises i went to a company where i started off making seventy thousand dollars and then within within literally six months i was able to get a razor for 80k right and so forth and so forth right yeah and there you go so yeah the skills will at the end of the day speak louder than everything else so one thing is you know just understand that the hours of you coding will lead to good to great results the difference is in the hours that you put in okay yes there are smarter strategies there's this and that but the hours are going to be you're defining you know part of your success so this is why this day boot camp guys how many hours are you going to put in into coding for these my five days let us know down in the comments below that's actually a great question yeah that's actually a great question 30 hours holy are you asking per day or the whole no no the whole five day boot camp okay yeah 10 hours per day 40 hours 50 hours holy moly sister per day 60 hour that you put in is for yourself so like if you put in overtime that's for yourself you know if you don't like if you put in two hours to me that just tells me you value yourself very poorly because you're well you see what i'm saying you're like hey i'm only going to invest two hours into this thing that's going to be my career into something that i'm going to be loving and doing for a longer period of my life you know if you're gonna do one to two hours don't do it at all all right um because the reason why i'm saying that i'm saying it from a really good place in my heart because it's not gonna work out if you want to do like this very small number of hours and then think you're going to succeed that's not going to happen because other software developers that are trying to learn they're going to keep putting in four or five hours and they're just going to beat you it doesn't matter even if you're smart or intelligent if somebody just keeps putting in more work than you on a regular basis they're just going to be better than you they're going to beat you you're going to go to an interview they're going to get the job and you're going to go home with the fact that you're like i had great worklife balance and i only did one hour of coding every day yeah no it's not gonna happen guys so like i don't discourage worklife balance i'm also not pro hustle you know just go crazy but i think that if you want to be great at something you do have to get a little obsessive at times and there's nothing wrong with that okay still sleep on time i still sleep and get my good sleep but every thought that comes out of my mind is about clever programmer is about how we can get you guys a better experience because let's be honest nobody else is doing events like these no all right and the reason why these are happening and why they're so good that we put together for you guys is because this is all we do and this is our entire focus and we're obsessed at 2 a.m i'm sending nas messages about how we can make it better or what we can do to better have better engagement with you guys even before this we were having arguments with like how can we actually give you guys video feedback on your freaking things and and we're like that's probably not going to be able to happen we have so many people i'm like let's we were like let's come up with a win it's obsession right it's like obsession to what you're trying to do that helps you get great results we're not a normal group of people we're not a worklife balanced group of people you know so our job here if you want to go be happy go to therapy it's brilliant but if you want to get good that's what we're here for we will do the work to make you happy too but we want to look at you like an engine you come to us how can we finetune you make you badass at software development and make you go get that job does that make sense that's what we're here for and especially in your younger years as you guys are starting this has been the best time to put as much time as possible as you're starting out inside development and i will tell you it's at some point it does get easier right and then maybe you will have more time for your family and stuff like that right um but yeah and yeah and don't let age be a barrier because wherever you start you will be completely good like yeah average age of a software developer when this start in us is like 34 or 37 okay if you start later than that it doesn't mean you can't pick it up if you start earlier than that doesn't mean you can't pick it up jack ma decided to launch his business when he was like 50 and he created alibaba and it became a billion dollar business so we literally have students here in the you know in our boot camp in our community who are 49 55 years old and they're starting their first careers in top development and have already have gone jobs is pretty insane yes okay so don't let those things discourage you whether some people are like i'm too young or i'm too old i'm like no you're just looking for excuses okay you you can do this all right the only thing that's going to happen between you going from 60 years old to 61 is you're going to go from 60 to 61 without being a software developer exactly or if you actually learn it you can be a software developer at 61 okay so it's doable just make sure the big butt there okay um is put in the work and it's doable okay it's not rocket science because i admit rocket science is pretty hard but software development is learnable a very very very learnable skill okay it just requires you to put in time and effort wait i just want to mention richard otis i love how you're watching this with your kid and just just you guys both are just smiling i love that that's actually great oldschool shitty here [Laughter] okay so let's keep going all right now in terms of how do you learn to code there are many ways you guys can learn to code you know for example you guys are here at the event just make sure you go all in okay obsession in my opinion is really the only way to learn because the people that i see dilly dallying the mo the ones that it takes the longest to like do this in these weird hour blocks or some type of weird schedule type of thing just i know if you have family and you have all this you don't have the luxury to go for 10 hours or 15 hours but whatever time you have just put all of that in okay like look let me let me tell you guys this right you guys don't put instagram youtube and whatsapp and all of these apps on a calendar yet all of you find a way to spend 30 hours 30 minutes or an hour or two or three hours a day to use those apps on facebook or instagram anything else it's not on your calendar so with coding find a way where it's fun for you where it doesn't feel like pulling teeth where you don't have to put schedules and reminders make it so you immerse in it so what i would recommend is that when when you're in this boot camp everything you should be eating and breathing should be around coding you have free time and you want to relax great watch a documentary on um on linustor vaults okay he created linux oh okay that's cool awesome so like watch stuff around coding okay watch stuff around software development use that time to be entertained yet inspire yourself because look you can't just start eating broccoli right you can you can't go from like eating garbage food and candy to all of a sudden eating broccoli 24 7. but what you can do is you can trick yourself and eat healthier candy okay eat healthier ice cream which tastes just as good as the crappy ice cream all right so go watch entertaining videos that talk about coding and software development so you're excited about doing it so that's what i would recommend work on all the stuff that you have in here and then the rest of the time play with it watch videos watch content immerse yourself where this is your life this is the new you okay and if you're here break through like literally have almost an identity level change okay who here would be excited if you left and you're just you're loving software development who would be excited about that change in you and you created and you've created those amazing projects at this point and now you're gonna see where you the potential is guys yeah there's so much potential so much absolutely okay so that's really in my mind how you learn to code in a really fast amount of time okay if you put 30 minute blocks you could do that for five years and you're gonna have a great thing going but you're not gonna be a great software developer okay so try to find ways where you could maximize it on each day and still get good sleep still get good food and still find a way i'm not asking you to kill yourself what i'm asking is use your time effectively i promise you there's two hours a day that are just being wasted into garbage if you focused that effectively on learning coding or doing some coding you wouldn't even need more time okay like how is elon musk running 20 different companies one launches rocket ships the other one is building a tunnel and like solving the traffic problem you know and then i don't know what other stuff that he's doing is crazy stuff he doesn't have more time than you or me no no no he's just being a lot more effective with his time and like and like and i want to give you guys a story guys like we have a student by the name of huda for example right and i'll get really good take this with two minutes right we have the student name huda she's in our booth camp and she lives in iran so for her actually you know the time for her for the coaching calls are very very late her coaching call time is 3 a.m in the morning but guess what it doesn't really matter for her because she still gets up at 3 in the morning she has three kids right she has a husband and and so forth she gets up at three a.m she learns with us literally for three hours per day from 3 a.m till about 6 a.m and after 6 a.m she gets up to then take her kids to school and after school after she leaves her kids at school then she comes back and then she also does homework and of course other things so right even though yes yes it's hard for her and yes she has to do this kind of stuff but the things that she already has done is amazing she's probably one of the hardest working people that i know just in general and so i want you guys to remember huda like when you think about any excuses that you might have and think about you know what i can learn this no matter what i have students who currently are doing truck driving anybody hear a truck driver by any chance anybody here truck driver anybody let me see in the chat if you guys are don't worry if you're not no worries but yeah for anybody who is a truck driver somebody said forklift driver yeah we have truck drivers who literally you know stop at truck stops just go ahead and learn with us it's crazy right it's all possible it's just you got to put the time into it that's it yeah absolutely yeah it's it's that that time component is really important and what i want to really emphasize is work hard to find that passion component because when you become passionate about it you just do this all the time like i don't need to think about clever programmer in time blocks and time portions because i love doing it my problem is the opposite of most people's problems people are like how do i stop procrastinating how do i you know put in the work how do i do all this my problem is the opposite my girlfriend can't it's hard for her to get me away from work like on a saturday or a sunday on my free day i just walked into nasa's office and i worked there this last sunday because i was like i was excited and and amberly she was like i think i'm gonna go do this other thing and i was sitting there i'm like what should i do i'm like i have the whole day to myself i'm gonna go to the office it's like the best thing i could do so find a way to build passion around it you know that's why i say be around the people that are in the community watch stuff around software development when you have that passion and excitement for it the rest of it becomes a lot easier you will just find a way to automatically put in the work agreed agreed okay now you know of course setting a goal for yourself is an important thing okay and and having realistic expectations so for example longterm goal for you would be hey i want to become a fullstack developer within the next one to five years that raise your hand that's your longterm goal here raising that's your longterm goal okay i like it if you have a if you have a different longterm goal let us know down and down the comments below yeah super curious yeah one to five years not too long so i'm saying we have steven says i'm in uh tutorial right now a lot of students are machine learning startup nice samir luna says i want to create something to better help the the foster care system wow that's awesome okay what's an sde software development something already sde software development engineering i don't know uh already a software development engineer got it yeah okay great so these are amazing goals that you guys are sharing yeah i think that realistically speaking you can become a pretty damn good developer within one to five years it takes a lot of work and if you really get committed you can definitely get a job within your first year so within the 12 months like for me i got my first job within the 12 months i had my first paying clients three months in and then six months in i had bigger paying clients i'm also obsessive and i was doing it like crazy but i think most people if you focus put in the hours you it's very possible for you to be able to get a job within your first 12 months okay and then shortterm goal you know also understand what's your shortterm goal so for example instead of learning five different types of things maybe make it something simple i want to just learn the fundamentals of javascript and then just go hard at that and master it okay so write it down maybe even have a timeline a rough timeline around it of what your goal is and what you're looking to do okay it could be even like build a todo app by myself by next week yeah all right yeah so there could be those are some simple ideas for you maybe after you're done with this boot camp maybe your goal can be within two days after the boot camp build the rock paper scissors app or that sas product that i built but from scratch by yourself four days five days yeah yeah and one thing we'll encourage you guys as you guys go into this kind of stuff is you know within the rock paper scissors game any of these other projects that you guys are building with us is to always you know try to test things out by yourself and even add extra features right and then after this boot camp your goal should be one on the goal i never learn how to build this can i now build it by yourself by myself and that's it and literally do it that way because yeah i probably believe that raise your hand if you feel right now you feel like you're having a hard time building stuff by yourself like you're watching tutorials and you can do them yeah look at that look at everybody's hands go up yeah you're not the only ones guys we here at clever program we talk to a lot of students hundreds of students on a daily basis and it's the same situation every single time you guys are going to tutorials but yet you do not know how to build stuff fully by yourself so what needs to happen what needs to change what do you guys think let me know let us know in the comments below one is to change for you to change that habit for something for something to happen let me know but yeah we can continue on building things solo discipline small passion to get it done damn it nice yeah all right um so you know if you guys want to plan things and put them just one recommendation we have for you is if you guys you know i don't know if you guys know notion or not but if any of you guys familiar with notion just raise your hand slightly no all good all good so notion is a really just good productivity tool it's free and it helps you basically write down your plans put together timelines whatever you kind of want to do all in one place so give it a shot it works for some people and i i recommend you know if you need something that helps you with planning this could be a really good tool that you could use okay so give it a shot and maybe a notion you can have when you're planning to do what okay and put your learning plan in here might be a good idea to do that just gonna quickly lay out seven most important habits that we notice that people who succeed or students who succeed and go and get a job as a developer and we just wanted to lay them out for you here okay and some of them that i want to highlight out of all of these are um so i'm going to start off with just this for now okay so hard work and patience when i say hard work honestly i feel really guilty saying that because it's weird but i kind of you know just honest truth i feel like kind of suck at hard work nas is extremely good at hard work um because for me what it feels like i just get so obsessed that it doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like work anymore at all and it literally feels like i'm playing a game and then i can just go through it and and even if i have to do it obsessively or for long term to me it doesn't really feel like work when i do things um why is that why is that i think that when i went to school i developed a i went to this like weird school when i was young and i developed this thing where i um because they took a lot of things from you and they restricted a lot of things and it was very like it was really disciplinary and i started hating doing things that i hated like really like most people probably are like i'll just wash the dishes it doesn't feel that bad or i'll do this other thing it doesn't feel that bad for me i started hating things with the passion that didn't like so much that now when i do things that i don't like it like kills my soul from the inside it like burns wow so um it made me wanna really focus on things i enjoy doing and then within that i found that when something is really enjoyable for me and it's fun and i like it and it's aligned with me i can go through tremendous amount of work and it doesn't feel like i worked it's almost like i wake up from it and i'm like what the hell just happened what did i just do probably some of you might have experienced that yeah right like for example you'll leave that if you guys went to college and you or or you know maybe think back to when you were a student you left your final exam all the way until the last freaking day to study right who did that who did that here i sure as heck did it so but then all of a sudden you look back and you're like damn man that was sick i was like a superhuman how did i pull that off that was crazy so when you kind of are aligned and you're excited about things and you enjoyed them you know personally that's what it feels like for me but i just want to say that hard work and having patience is a key component okay so for me how i played it is i'll give you guys my workbook okay my recipe and nas laughs at me but i'm gonna share this with you but like for me patience is a really key thing and patience comes from expectation so when you have really high expectations you're really impatient with yourself you'll be really hard on yourself and also i think a lot of sense of loss great stems from having poor expectations all right so for example when i started coding i'm like in five years i'll have a job the first year i'm just supposed to suck not have a job constantly lose but i worked my ass off and i learned like crazy okay and then i'm like whatever happens happens if i get a job within the five years it's just a bonus so like in my mind i'm never losing i'm always winning every day even if i don't get a job for the five years i'm winning um even when i started clever programmer it started off like i i remember i got on a call with my friend tenzin and i'm like i want to fail the only thing i want to work on this year is fail 10 business ideas that's my only goal for this year work on 10 things that i'm going to fail and then i start a clever programmer and it succeeded and it became it became good um and it was like hey this is just a bonus this is this is great so why i'm sharing this with you guys is if you set your expectations right and you're not like i need a job within the next month you play that long game but you work your ass off now you'll also have this weird thing called happiness and peace along the way yeah okay see this is this is where i get a little bit even different sometimes you know because like for me this is where like kazi like we got these two different personalities in a way where kaizen like always looks like the worst case scenario you're not working but like always like you know what if i just get this i'll be fine right for me it's like i always said these crazy crazy things like guys i'm going to do this we're going to do this like for me if i was that position i'd be like okay i gotta have a job literally one year gotta get there you know like what can i do right but from that even so as as i've gotten older i realized how much of that is not so much important like yes that personality has gotten to where i am today right but i've also realized that that's not a necessity personality right like yes i want to push hard and go hard all the time and that's really good and that can really get you to a lot of places um at the same time you i kind of realized that i need to learn to almost kind of like step back and let things happen for you you know weirdly enough right and like instead of having this crazy expectations which i still sometimes do and i still like to push myself towards them i am a lot more relaxed knowing that you know what if i don't hit that somehow i know i'll hit it either later or some or something else might hit as well so i think that's the most important thing is i don't like bog myself down because that's what i used to do i used to literally punish myself for not knowing hey you know what oh i didn't get an a on this test or you know what i didn't do this or i don't have a job yet like what's going on with me yeah and that wasn't so pretty honestly so yeah now it does definitely change that though i'm still working on it yeah so just two perspectives from two different people take what you value throw away what isn't valuable for you um but i think that's kind of what i want to share from d7 of course the other ones are important like taking initiative of course you have to be good at learning a lot because with development all those things change but you know this is this is the reason i see a lot of people quit having bad expectations and they go i'm gonna do two hours of coding and by the sixth month i'll have a job and then that leads to unhappiness and i see lots of people quit out of this career if you flip it it will make you really happy um and you will actually get through a lot of the crappy things that you need to get through okay so beautiful let's keep on going um so um yeah if you get angry and you're coding and things don't work sometimes there's one solution is to break your computer the second solution is to you know um which what i prefer when i'm playing chess is for me i will like actually go for a walk or other ones are all google and stack overflow which is actually what i do that's usually the best answer yeah so because yeah like start off of course when things don't work one of the things that i want to just tell you guys is you have to become ninjas at googling googling is yours going to be the way to solve problems it's your superpower yeah and you'll build a pattern recognition experience with how to understand the problems because for me for me it literally took a few years to be able to actually understand the answers that i would see on stack overflow like for the first couple of years with software development when i would see answers on stack overflow they would never make any sense to me and i'm like i don't understand how to fix this but just googling random things that would help me kind of start getting into the right place okay of course you can also ask your question but so let me just start with this google stack overflow but one thing i'd recommend is those two ways are generally what i consider lazy ways of thinking because you want somebody else you want to outsource your thinking to somebody else which i think is fine if you're an experienced software developer because you shouldn't have to think all the freaking time but i think when you're new use these as learning opportunities so before you go to other people and go hey daddy can you please help me lift this grocery bag or this weight it's too heavy for me i think stop and flex your own thinking muscles first okay do as far as possible right yes and we're not here trying to say that you know what you can't ask questions that's not what we're trying to say here at all instead what we're trying to say here is like hey just give yourself time to figure the solution yeah because crazy enough actually in the process of figuring out a solution is what where you learn the most like you go from one thing to another thing and what's gonna happen is you're building out patterns around coding right and after that for example let's say as you're researching you realize there was something else that you might have been missing the whole time like oh dang this is interesting yeah and so that's where really enough your brain is going to pick up more things than just by you coding because the thing is a lot of students that we have sometimes you guys potentially just you try to get the answer too fast yeah that's one thing that's another thing that comes with patience which is like you'll run into a problem and almost like you get some level of anxiety not knowing the answer and you want to get it really really really fast and so then you will go and ask that question to somebody or get on a call with somebody and you know this is going to sound weird but like i don't know if this is true i'm not a scientist and i haven't done research on this but i generally feel like people who ask too many questions generally don't do well in those particular industries and the reason why i say this is i think what's actually happening is either they're not designed for this industry and maybe something else might be better for them maybe they're more communic social people maybe they would be better working as a team manager for a software development company communicating with everybody but i think what they're what is happening there is they're outsourcing their thinking so they're being lazy thinkers okay and one thing you definitely have to make sure you get good at as a software developer is the more you put your thinking under tension just like being a bodybuilder right when you put your muscle under tension the longer you put it for under tension the more your muscle is gonna grow yep so with software development it's all about thinking it's not about you knowing tools it's not about you doing things quickly it's about your ability to think and the more time you could put your brain what's up think and problem solve i'm just gonna say yeah think and problem solve and the more time you can put your brain under tension your brain actually will physically expand okay brains physically expand when they actually do the brain analysis and like that they even found that the taxi drivers in uk because they have to memorize so much about how the roads and the traffic works they actually have bigger brains physically so it's a muscle but it takes time and those moments where you feel pain and you're like man i just want to know the answer i want to get to the answer under that stress is where you become a really strong software developer yeah because like i said it just like cause you're saying just repeat like yeah brain is a muscle it grows as you build it this is why and even in these situations right the most important here is not the fact that you're learning javascript the most important thing here is now you're learning html or css the most important thing that you're learning is problem solving and it's thinking when you have a bug in front of you and you can't solve it or it's when you have a feature to build and you really just don't know how to go about it it's like you're trying to figure it out this is where you're building that brain so we want you guys to encourage that these next five days we encourage you literally challenge yourself as much as possible and you will find some amazing amazing results from that yeah and let me tell you something where your brain will try to trick you when you get stuck in a problem your brain will tell you and your brain is completely blank okay so i think you guys might have experienced that right where you run into has that ever happened to you guys where you guys run into a problem and then you're trying to think of a solution your brain is literally blank yeah colors are blocking your child said green right colors like you're like hey i'm literally not making any progress so your brain will actually trick you and your brain will say neo you're not making any progress so why don't you just look up the answer because you're not making any progress anyway and that's a trap that's a trap because your brain wants to survive because it knows if it thinks more it's more work your body doesn't want to do more work your body just wants to survive for a longer period of time another day you're still a biological creature that that has a primary function of survival so your brain will literally try not to do work and trick you like you know like you don't need to think about this there's google ah somebody has the answer it's like a crack addict that just needs another like fix so what you need to do at that point is ignore that voice of your brain and just chill like go go for a walk the tricky thing is sometimes at least for my brain i'll spend 30 minutes or 40 minutes and i have made no forward progress and then all of a sudden things starts clicking in a weird way yeah so i think sometimes that part is important like to not look at the answer and just get in the flow of it even if it takes you four hours of being unproductive it's going to actually help you at the end of the day yeah really enough yeah um all right because like there's some people who are like nas and this guy's either developed a really strong system for problem solving or probably is a little gifted as well but like he immediately's brain is like thinking of the way to solve the problem and he'll like start breaking it down for me my brain will be blank for like 30 minutes to an hour and then things will start coming in and then i'm like all right here we go it takes me time you know okay cool so full stack developer there are a lot of things that means it's a big term but generally what what what's happening is is these three things here okay other things can be of course a part of it too let me clear this and let me just draw with my other one okay but it's these three things here so when you when you hear full stack developer i want you to think front end back end database okay and database generally i even consider database to be part of back end okay so really when you when you hear a full stack i just want you to think front end and back end that's all okay these are the only two things i want you to think about all right when i when i say front end it's clicking but all the stuff that looks pretty and does stuff that you see with your eyes it's the view one what's up it's the view guys it's what you see on facebook what you see on instagram when you go on there it's what you're seeing right here right when you're on youtube or you're on zoom it's coaches yes yeah the user interface and all of that so for example what nas is saying is they could have had the videos in like excel type of thing where when you type in a search it's just an excel document with the list of videos right and you read the names and you click on the one that you like but then they decided hey instead of showing the view in that way how about actually we show thumbnails of the video in a way where it looks more clickable and friendly yeah would you would you guys agree that'd be that that's a lot better is that better or not yeah yeah so the ui okay and the design that's more frontend when when we talk about backend it's more about for example how exactly is youtube able to handle billion gigabytes of new storage that's being uploaded to their website yeah that's interesting right yeah because your google drive can't do that no right where where am i going to store it like if i gave you okay if i gave you a billion gigabytes of footage where exactly are you going to store it what would you do with it like i'm just curious someone said the cloud where would you go with that well it'd be crazy right and if you um so that's just a simple example then what if you have a million people streaming what if you have one person streaming at a time okay you solve that that's great but if you have 100 people streaming at the same time you solve that that's great what if you have a billion people streaming at the same time ooh that's an interesting problem so back end okay that's that stuff is back in and it's equally if not more important yeah it's kind of what it's the things you don't see that's the hard work right uh you know when you for example log into facebook guys right and you put in your username username and password where do you think that username password goes to what do you guys think well a database it goes to database it goes to the backend right it goes to an api that they have right then the api checks the back end says hey is this guy real or not if he's not he's like oh no this guy's not real right it's a thormann error but if he's real okay all right let's go ahead and log him in and actually showcase watch and then give him all the information about himself who here knows about popular ugly websites does anybody here know any popular ugly websites let us know in the comments i'm curious well there used to be reddit there's craigslist and craigslist right but even even reddit has changed their ui now okay and i think craigslist might soon or maybe it's just craigslist i really doubt i really thought they're gonna change anything yeah that might that might never change there yeah so not many websites are gonna continue to be that ugly okay but i'm sure they have really good back ends but they don't have a good front end okay and now they're working on their front end as well because they're losing viewers and users and they're like okay let's do this okay all right um in terms of somebody saying no okay i'll go go good okay okay cool so in terms of technologies you guys need to learn okay um you'll need to know html you'll need to know css okay this is this right here is html this is css and javascript okay so these three if there's something for you guys to focus on this is what i would focus on for a while pick up react later but just keep in mind react is a baby of javascript okay javascript is the dad react is the baby so learn these first and then react is going to be easier cool and then you can also learn a firebase which is a database okay and that's where you can actually store stuff so that's going to be helpful when you're making apps where you have other users that can log in log out you have user authentication um things like that okay yeah i want to launch a poll here guys which one would you want to do front end backend or full stack i'm really curious here let me know that's so cool i love the poll yeah damn we have 200 and almost we have 300 people just answered the poll right now that's pretty fast like guys even this whole poll right if you think about it which portion is the view of the front end which portion is the front end right which person's the front end well it's what is the u actually seen right the question and you've been able to answer it and then which portion is the back end it's which one where where the poll is being stored well yes the poll being stored and where you you guys are actually being being able to when you answer the poll it's storing your answer in the database that's it wow we almost got 400 responses yeah that is phenomenal to the poll so yeah so it looks like 290 of you said you want to become full stack developers okay we're sharing the results now 36 said you you know nine percent says back end 19 said front end and 73 of you said full stack development so you know um with full stack you know both front end and back end and what's amazing about that is that it makes you really uh valuable at your company which means you're probably going to be if if this happened god forbid this happens but you're going to be the last person that's fired because you're needed you're like needed needed right um just because it makes you so versatile all right but both of these other options if you chose front end and back end they're not wrong either they're great and there are plenty of people making a lot of money doing either of those okay so both of those are valuable awesome thanks for sharing guys now html css and javascript here's how you guys should think about it right html is just a skeleton okay html is pretty much when you like when you don't have any clothes on you're just this html structure all right it's like your bones basically yeah css is when you put on makeup when you put on clothes when you get ready right that's your that's the style like that i look good exactly so when you go to a website that doesn't have css those websites are absolutely hideous okay unlike you you're beautiful even with but no makeup on anything because you're here and we love you [Laughter] don't let anybody else tell you otherwise but for but for um websites when they don't have css they are they're awful to look at they're not pleasant you guys know what i'm talking about those css like or those uh you guys have seen like these university professors always post homework and it's always on like these ugliest websites you've ever seen um that's just with html okay and then javascript adds action to the thing it has the funkiness the funkiness of you being able to dance and the you know to think and to do all these other different things that's right so like when you actually click a button what happens you know how does a video load oh when i'm on youtube and i hit that thumbs up button it turns blue interesting okay those are all things happening with javascript cool so html is basically if you guys want to write this down as well if you know it that's that's great but this is what makes a page work it's the structure of a page okay this is what really bare bone html looks like and this html if you wrote this you would have a page or a website that's actually running or doing something okay uh one good place i recommend you guys go to if you want to just write random code and have fun stack blitz is a phenomenal resource and you can go here and do stuff so i'm gonna i'm just gonna choose i'm gonna go to stack blitz and i'm just gonna choose html javascript css boom right there you guys can see my screen cool so i'm just gonna choose index.html here all right that'd be great what's up if you can zoom in on that that'll be great oh just comment there we go nice okay great so i'm here right now if i add in other stuff onto this page let's just say i write okay i don't want to sign in leave me alone so let's just say i write a h2 and i say hello ron all of a sudden i have hello ron mmhmm okay uh let's go now which portion is that guys what he's doing right now which portion is that let us know in the comments below which i don't know what that question means as an is this is this the html the css or is the javascript ah okay got it yeah so yeah which one is this am i working what am i working on here beautiful everybody's saying html exactly nice wow good smart crowd i love it thank you guys so yeah this is the html portion right and now if i make it h6 it'll become much smaller okay now if i was to change the color of this uh that would be what portion if i just asked you guys right now if i was to change the color of hello charles to to something else green some good answers out here good nice to have david nice css exactly that would be the styling good job so at a very basic level that's effectively what's happening okay so let's keep going on with our presentation and remember you can use the stack blitz resource it's awesome it's free it's epic gets you up and running super quick all right css you can use you can learn how to use different layouts flexbox responsive design media query so for example when i go on youtube these guys might actually be using flexbox to show their videos in a specific way okay so like for example the first row has three four five six videos right the next row also has six videos in this row essex they might be using flexbox to uh display it where there's like this little gap in between these videos here um it's laid out in this perfect like line here like this right a row so that's an example of flexbox let's go cool let's keep going and and by the way now if you ever want to show something to just let me know i can i'll stop my screen sure and you can do it too okay i'll keep going that's all good so let's go so and this is what css looks like so css will look like this where you're styling things you're targeting a certain block you're giving it a certain color okay so for example if we go back to this let's see maybe i can go to my style css let's look at this one right this is h6 so maybe i can go here and go hey also h6 save cool and can i give it um let's see if i give it a different color all of a sudden it's all green okay so it's really simple how it allows you to be able to play with it and you know change things cool and of course you can get more complex with it and do fancier things with it right here you have hover oh i could point on it and then it turns red fancy okay when it comes to go ahead now you want to talk about this so what do you need to know when you learn javascript yeah so for jaw so click on that again so the javascript comes up i think nice awesome so for the javascript portion guys what we really want to focus on is not so much just done basically learning a lot of complex things instead we want to focus on on learning the basic things right so for example here what we got is data types so one of the things right so guys what are the what are some data data types do we have let me know in the comments below well what do we know we know there's like variables right there's like you know an integer there's strings right there's objects there's arrays there's booleans all those are data types it's kind of like you need to know how to use them because you know each one provides you with a different solution each one allows you to do different things right if you want to have a data type for example hey is this user logged in or not what kind of data data type would you use oh that's a good one huh yeah yeah that's a that's a good one which one would you guys use if the user is logged in or not there's some good answers yeah like kind of like victor said yeah you use a boolean right what did which did the type would you use for example if you wanted to um have a list of for example names right and you want to be able to list them out what data would you use yeah correct and array right or what data would you use to for example to describe a user describe the use that's currently logged into facebook what data would you use yeah that's right exactly like an object right so this is where you guys need to learn all these different things so you can properly use them because sometimes when i talk to students you guys have no idea what that is instead you just kind of like oh yeah i get i get i get it you know here is his hand right yeah yeah i get it now they exist but like and which points i use it well you got to know when to use them next thing is of course functions es6 and us7 so with functions what's a function guys who knows what a function is anybody what's a function hector knows well a function is basically something that allows you to take a piece of your piece of code right and to store it and basically to create a reusable piece of code so for example let's say i have a piece of code for logging for logging you in right facebook has a piece of code for logging you in whenever you click the login button what do you think it will call what function what function the login function exactly let's say you guys want to go let's say let's talk take me for example as a person i want to go for a run what internal tools inside me is a person do i have to go for a run and what do i activate right what is it your legs right your arms all your muscles it's like it's like almost like a reusable function right do you know exactly what you need to activate in order to go for a run it's the same thing here next up dom manipulation now dom manipulation is very interesting because what do you see on there right in terms of a landing page when you go on any website let's say google.com or facebook.com you see a page right but what happens when you for example what happens when you for example a new post gets gets picked up right what happens then or for example you're on youtube right now right and let's just say that you right now for example you go to let's see subscriptions or originals let's say you click on originals click on originals there we go so you can see the left side bar stayed the same right while the right section of this page changed that's funny so what happened was basically we manipulate the dom which is the document object model which is what the page is it's the structure of the page and you said basically when you clicked on originals what do we say hey you know what the left sidebar stays the same we don't change the left sidebar look but the right section of the sidebar changes the content that's called down manipulation next up is going to be what scope so scope i won't go too much deeper but scope is basically where what scope is like kind of like um you have an access to something only within certain parts of the application right for example your password would you want your application to have access that password or no probably not because of safety reasons yeah probably not so we give your password only access to certain parts of the application potentially right that's scope next thing data structures data structures are freaking cool because a lot of people go ah boring but when you think about the boring company by elon musk that is using tons okay so also when you go on google that search engine is using data structures and algorithms if i told you for you know make a search engine you would need to use data structures and algorithms a lot of times there's binary trees there's stacks there's cues there's linked lists and the sad part about you guys or about a lot of students is they don't know what those are yeah they escape through them and in order for you guys because because everything else sounds fancier and much more fun you know this is like eating broccoli like nobody wants to eat broccoli that's a good that's a good thing our job is to make a cake shove broccoli inside of it and just like force feed it to you you know like here so that you think the escape but it's actually broccoli underneath the cake you know yeah yeah it's like a fake painting of a cake right but we know it's good for you right so that's the most important thing [Laughter] right it's like and like apis are the next thing up which are going to be important for you guys to actually learn all right so that was my timer guys i have to run uh nas is going to be with you for the rest of the time you guys have been absolutely amazing thank you guys so much so far but guys there's still a lot more left okay so right now is not the time to leave right now is actually the time to buckle in even harder okay because there's gonna be amazing things now's gonna be sharing with you guys just wanna say love you guys and uh keep crushing it okay keep going guys yep let's do it let's do it awesome sweet awesome thanks quasi they're like love you too [Laughter] all right guys awesome sweet so you guys still see uh the page everything right you guys see every everything correct yes beautiful sweet sweet sweet wait so kaza you can actually now go if you need to leave skype you can feel free to leave skype i got myself on here you got everybody see is the screen yes yes all good give me a thumbs up guys all good beautiful thank you thank you thank you so currently we're killing what we're adding where did we get to guys let me see where did we get to well where we're at right now is we're currently on this side my right yep let's go ahead and click on this specific section so you guys can see beautiful sweet all right cool so this is where we're at right now right you guys are of course and this is an example of course of javascript as we see right now right what we have right now is we have this right here is what this is an object or this is actually an array right and then this right here is what this is an object right here this section okay all right and of course this right here is kind of like a filter function that that's being used right that's javascript so so what do we have here okay let's talk about some frameworks because javascript and html and css oh great they're kind of like the bare bones right it's kind of like when you're building a house guys what do you build first what do you build first what do you build first tell me what do you guys think in the given tell me the chat where it gets built first in terms of house the foundation correct and so really the javascript html the css what those are is those are just simply the foundations right but we need to build stuff on top of that for that for you to be fully useful this is where we go get into frameworks this is something that we'll explain here in this specific presentation okay well the most on the popular frameworks we have here are number one angular anybody know angler here raise your hand yeah good good good okay okay that's one next one we know is called view anybody know what view is ujs beautiful beautiful and then the third one we got is react and this one is tom tom tom this one is the best one or that that's the one that we like the most [Laughter] right now you might be asking yourself a question of like why is react so cool why react in general both of these frameworks are really good both are amazing right in terms of what they do and what they allow you to do the thing however is that we've realized is that look at the companies are currently using all these different frameworks so what do we have react.js right used by airbnb by instagram uber eats you know dropbox you know and so forth angularjs upwork paypal sony right so still pretty very much useful am i right correct however what should you i choose which one would you choose guys let me know in the comments in the in the zoom chat below i'm very curious which one would you choose react react react angular react react holy moly dang okay okay i like it i like it i like him a lot of react people so the reason why we just say react is because why this really is called a stack overflow survey that stack gorflow does every single year and they found out that react.js is one of the top ones out there right it's being used by a lot a lot of companies you know year in and year out you know it's a v and it's a really enough it's actually a lot more efficient and real life is actually it's a lot more faster than any of these other frameworks and it's because this is called a library while this is called a framework anybody anybody know the difference between a library and a framework here who knows anybody spelling victor says that's funny that's i mean that's pretty good so framework versus a library which one so library is a collection of tools chanda says embedded with frameworks okay a firmware has certain user specifications somebody says what else library connection collection of code library so good question so a library is basically a library is more bare bones so a bare bones built built built on bare bones javascript and and it gives right and it gives you a lot gives you a lot of basically room to play so it's a lot very flexible what does that mean basically it's using very much javascript underneath the hood yes but it's really built on javascript versus angular is basically you are limited limited to functionalities that it has functionalities that it has it's kind of like it's kind of like the mac os system or the you know the windows system right we're limited to the functionality that this has right so that's kind of where our frame will really come in right we're very limited but by what functionalities those mac os system and they give us you guys understand that yes or no raise your hand with me right versus a library it's almost kind of like linux more so i would say it's got the closest one it's like linux a library is where you can actually build things on top of it you can build other things on top of react gs because it's using more more bare bones right so this is where uh react.js is actually kind of winning because it's very much bare bones and so it's a lot more efficient and look at that here's some downloads per year some more data for you on the downloads per year section you can see for example react is very much going up up and up and up the whole time look at that it's pretty cool hey so that means that react for the win all right so top ten companies using javascript of course we got linkedin very important company we got facebook we got microsoft we got ebay tesla groupon netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal anybody using these companies of course of course and guys all these companies are the ones that are using javascript using these technologies like angular like react.js like you know like vue okay so here are some now resources resources that we will be using to learn okay all right so let me go ahead and go more reasons to learn front end we have companies like free code camp of course right amazing resources for you guys to learn you know there's free cold camp anybody here use learning free from free code camp anybody here nice nice good good good yourself front end mentor anybody has learned here from front and mentor so fundamental is not so much about learning coding but it's so much they have basically beautiful projects for you guys to do who here has trouble with projects anybody like trouble with the like basically trying to figure out what products to build well these guys actually will be the solution for you these guys right here find a mentor these guys for the mentor they have amazing products though they are designed for you all you have to do is build them and they're beautiful looking beautiful looking okay beautiful looking awesome and of course we have youtube so on youtube we have of course a few things so if you go to clubprogrammer.com on youtube um let me go ahead if you join our community there oh wait wait wait wait so if you go to youtube for example we have a lot of courses for example like we have an html cross course for beginners right here we have a css course course for beginners right here and so forth okay so a lot a lot of technologies you can learn from youtube as well let me go wait next community okay so guys at this point this has been our presentation on your opportunity to become a developer guys who is excited for your opportunity to become developer who's excited for you guys to learn this to become developers for you guys to build amazing projects and to land those jobs that you guys want to oh my god you guys are covering my screen holy moly if only you guys saw my screen i've been saying i love it i love it i love the energy you guys have i'm gonna go into q a here in a second so you guys can ask any questions we'll go one by one okay and hit the bell icon but before that i want you guys to take out a piece of paper okay everybody here please take out a piece of paper and pen all right or if you guys use your phone to screenshot that'd be great too you guys can use your phone take a picture so because of course this is a fiveday bootcamp this is our first day right now so we want you to give you guys homework every single day we will have homework for you understood comprende yes can i get a thumbs up hey can i get a thumbs up hey can i get a thumbs up yeah there you go that's what i'm talking about i love it shitlana's like yes thumbs up so here's your homework number one is we want you to go ahead and download visual studio code right here very very important okay so download videos to the code this is what you will be coding in okay download visual studio code get to know how to use it right maybe create a new project create a new file right figure that out this is what you'll be using basically guys tomorrow after that build your own portfolio website so guys we are going to be giving you a portfolio website look at this if i go ahead and look at this one look at that this is a portfolio website that will be giving you to use fully like you have the fullon project for yourself you can use this for companies you can use this for you know portfolio on linkedin pretty much anywhere and look at how good it looks look at that you can you got your skill sets right here you guys can talk about of course you've got your projects which is these are the projects you'll be able to put on for yourself right here of course right uh after that what else you got well you might have you know kind of like what you do maybe you're maybe you're teaching maybe you're coaching then maybe you have look at that it's dave by the way he's actually he's he actually works with us um you know you basically just kind of basically put out who you are so guys how awesome is this how awesome is this

love it beautiful let's continue on okay all right next up is gonna be here's your homework at this point wait let me go ahead how do i here's where this point is so the number one thing is going to happen the following first thing is download the portfolio website which is this one okay and the link guys we will have uh the link in the facebook post but feel free to screenshot this right now okay so number one download your portfolio very important okay number two watch how to use a portfolio video that's number two okay that's also so we will show you how to use it how to use it how to

i'm guessing right right am i am i right right so you want to do that of course and then update your experience section so any section you want to change on here just going to change it you know you know change your skill sets change your skill sets in here gonna change your projects change your projects in here right um go ahead and just modify the content and guys be creative with it this is the start of your journey this is where you now showcase what you can potentially do you start learning so if you want to change the theme of how this looks like do that you want to change the colors do that the more creative you're going to get the more you'll learn and the more you stand out so who here is gonna get created who here is gonna try and change things up on their portfolio everybody hey beautiful that's what i like to see now really important what i want you guys to do is of course screenshot your portfolio make a screenshot of your portfolio okay like a screenshot upload a z comment in the homework post on facebook okay very important so i'll put as a comment in the homework post on facebook so we will make a homework post on facebook okay and what we want you guys to do is to comment down below basically just your portfolio and showcase exactly what you've done not only will you get to inspire others but you also get to showcase like what you know and so you get to connect with other people as well does that make sense comprende comprende good good good good good and then finally the last thing that i want you to want you guys to do is the following submit your homework on ear table for us to give you a review of your or for your homework so that's it submit the screenshot to an airtable link again this airtable link will provide you guys in the homework post on facebook all right you we will also send out an email so make sure you guys click on the air table link and then provide your home post and it kind of looks like this it'll look a little like this kind of like this right so you can see right here day one homework submissions your name your email your phone number your screenshot uh and your your deploy url if you deployed it online does that make sense everybody yeah good good good good awesome sweet other than that that's pretty much it right now everybody right now i want you guys to go ahead and take a screenshot of this or use your phone to take a picture take a picture of you guys so you guys know it of course we'll make the homework post for you but you know for now i would say just just take a screenshot so you guys have

that it it was giving me a little bit of trouble um in this course are we going to become hello i'm sorry about that can you your cat is eating you yeah i know this sucks um in this course are we going to be covering git uh so we won't be covering git specifically but we'll be using git to kind of like you guys will see me doing like a push and a pull you guys will see me committing things so but i won't be forcing you guys so much into learning get so much focus on more so on like the javascript side the html side and the windows projects okay awesome thank you so much you got it awesome any more questions let's see who else we got who else gavin go ahead my friend i just had a question um about um when you say launch do you mean using netlify or heroku yeah yeah you can you get you could you can use nullify heroic creators just can put your project live okay for us to see and that's pretty much it and then um for the project section do you just want us to leave it blank or if for some of us that don't have projects yeah if you don't have projects feel free just leave a blank honestly if you don't have any projects yeah don't worry yeah if you don't you probably just leave it blank okay but the other the other skill sets you can use you can you can just put on there you know and i mean yes at the end of this basically you will be able to put your three brothers that you will build so at the end of all this and then you'll be able to put the actual projects you know uh that will be building this fiveday bootcamp understand got it awesome sweet cool cool any more questions let me see who else ron how are you doing my friend let me see ron let me see well yeah go ahead hi ron hey how you doing um you know this is my first time like entering into uh software programming and okay now it's uh i know with the projects everything's coming and there some people here know a little bit what to do you know um based on the project and the homework that we're gonna do the html is like would you recommend us uh you know going over the videos first before you go and start tackling on that homework yeah i mean i mean uh you mean like the portfolio homework is that what you're talking about right yeah because we have to like uh change it up do something because i'm i'm like all ready to go and do this that's awesome i love it i love it honestly i think just just kind of throw yourself into it perish like like really enough what's gonna happen is that when you throw yourself into it and you just kind of like um you know you kind of see things and you see challenges in front of you you're going to work backwards you know what i mean so you're going to see oh oh dang okay how do i start to start up this project well then you're going to go on google search up how do i start this project and then you get the answers so you'll be working backwards biscuit the whole time like doing like reverse engineering exactly exactly which is the fun part of it uh just in general as well yeah yeah i'm i'm an industrial designer by trade okay sorry a lot of little manufacturing portion so i i know what you're saying like you know thinking backwards and going sideways that's cool and so and so why you want to get into coding is that right yeah definitely that's awesome that's awesome and so like have you got us on community and things like that um say that again have you put yourself on the community are you in our community yeah yeah yeah i'm already part of it yeah beautiful beautiful cool cool yeah yeah cause i i started going doing the entering in the route of a software qa mmhmm the engineering so like doing more of the end away and then even working my way up to going to do being developing you know nice so that's like probably the next round so wait i'm curious why switch why why why the whole switch i'm just curious um industrial design i mean this is uh i love it but at the same time it's like you know i feel like i'm not doing a lot of good and creating things so like i want to do something like i that's going to last put my stamp on it like really hard you know i feel like you know with with the software like i could create something new and it's going to go like it's going to go viral or just stay static or i'll be able to help out yeah be better you know so that's honestly the best part to all of you guys the best part about coin that i personally find is like it's like basically like the way i think of ourselves as developers is literally inventors like i think of us as inventors i'm not gonna lie you know kind of like einstein level you know which is crazy right but yeah if you think about it yes you're not creating any hardware per se here but if you have an idea and you create a software that can help a lot of people yes you're taking an idea from your head and you're putting into for people to use yeah exactly like that's awesome am i right yeah right i mean that that's that's what you have to think about i mean as a designer i'm always thinking like oh how am i gonna make this better for this person and what i want to do for this yeah exactly well i take the same concept i'm thinking like hey you know what in software yeah how do you how are they going to approach it how they're going to look at it how they're going to like go around it i love it i just ask questions so that's good well it's problem solving that's probably it's it's all promising and it's honestly it's the most fun right so i think yeah if that's what if that's what you like ron i think uh you're in a good position you're in a good position to learn at this point now you just need to put in a lot of work and learning and you will get to it right and most importantly just don't let anything else stop you no i mean with the community and i think i see everyone here that's awesome that wants to do something you know we'll all be friends and you know definitely be like working all together probably you know i love that love yeah we'll go together guys make connections guys most importantly is if you're on this facebook community like use this community right get together get to know each other as you guys are counting together get to know each other and you guys will see a big big big difference all right hey nah thank you again thank you my friend all right you got it my friend okay i'll see you later okay well i'll see you tomorrow let me in pst well i see you tomorrow right yeah yeah good good good good awesome sweet all right let's go ahead next up who's got a question uh jeffrey hello how are you my friend uh i just want to know but i think i got it where the youtube site was what's up you i just want to know the youtube oh where the youtube was the youtube recording yeah yeah just go to youtube and go to clever clever and then type in clever programmer okay and then you'll see that video there okay okay understand awesome sweet all right next question we got joseph hello my friend go ahead hi joseph hey sorry about that oh so how um how creative can we get with this i mean i've been doing you guys tutorials since back on the uh disney clone oh wow really yeah i've done them all back since you started with the todo app nice it's uh react and i actually uh went to boot camp for react but unfortunately there's a lot of things you're not uh trained for you're not you're throwing a bunch of things i come from an engineering background so you're throwing a bunch of things and it's like here do this and then how do you get around per se a lot of companies want a bachelor's degree and where i'm at in florida that's like the big staple that i'm the big big brick wall i'm smacking into that's hard and like how do i push past that like whenever i follow you up with one you guys provided which is a lot better than the one i designed how do you going forward how do you push past that with that mindset is what my question is so good question i think basically i'm going to read it what you're asking right so you're asking me basically right you're currently in florida and you're trying to figure out uh kind of like a lot of companies you're saying that are asking for a bachelor's degree and of course you're in an engineering background right now and what do you do right now in terms of engineering at beckham um i haven't done anything with six years i'm actually disabled now oh so i stepped away from yeah so i programmed uh roughly 7 a.m to 2 a.m so i'm always programming wow i'm always doing something wow and i have the technical knowledge but i want to go your you kind of you you've i've mainly followed you and i you've kind of inspired me a lot because i want to go to the freelance route and i want to go and i don't know how to get there okay that's why i came to you guys for that road map how do i get there and avoid the corporate aspect yeah so of course so i am so one video you should watch is i had on youtube and write this down there's a video on youtube that i i did with blake connolly and um and he is a ceo of a freelancing software agency uh basically and he's only 20 23 years old and yeah only 23 years old and he's still a sub agency and a million dollars off their agency which is crazy and he started off literally with like um he started out with you know just kind of doing small projects by himself um he started i was just doing some upworks and freelancing projects building really low not making a lot of money initially but as he got more reviews as he got more you know as he got more experience he was able to rack up his price to this point i mean he's charging over a hundred dollars per hour and you know some of his projects are worth you know uh a few hundred thousand dollars right when he's working with the team okay because i asked sex i'm sure there are others amongst the other 200 or so of us that are here that probably think the same thing and i've done uh i've been stuck in tutorial health for about five years and it's that's where why i've come to this boot camp cause i wanna see if i can connect the dots to break free from that yeah because tutorial health if a lot of you guys don't know it some of you don't it's it's a nasty cycle it's a nasty cycle oils and you're trying to build stuff on your own but you may lack the either the creativity or you like the direction to get those tutorials or to make your own things and it's not easy i mean i still find myself i i'll design something on paper and i'm like well let me go throw it in figma let me go throw it in adobe xd let me figure out and then you'll get stuck and that's why i'm that's why i came here because i want to see in the next five days can i do your three projects on my own and see you know how do i get there that's why i thought i would ask you it's why i kind of dropped in here today was that was like i'm gonna ask dad if he knows how to make that dot is so let me ask you this question like what kind of like what kind of things have you learned before like what kind of fundamentals do you know um i started with c sharp okay i worked my way up through javascript html5 css3 bootstrap material ui into react uh es6 7 8 9 and 10. okay and i've worked my way through uh i didn't learn data and algorithms okay unfortunately so joseph i if i if i were to here to ask you one question if i told you right now joseph can you for example if i was to give you a javascript problem and i asked you hey can you for me um merge if i give you two arrays in javascript one array call a one array called b and they both had numbers in them if i could talk to create a function for me to merge them together would you be able to do it yeah you you would look through both of them and you would merge them as the final product you would print them out as a final in a third uh object you would create a third uh variable to merge those two into one how using that okay so okay so use the loop and then what would you do you would map through a and you would map through b so you use a for loop you use a for loop and you'd say four uh iss and five uh i plus plus if that one you'd use a map function you you would map through it and then you would add it you would print that out add those add that variable to the next function with a another for loop using the variable k and so on and you print those both out with uh console log uh i plus k or whatever variable you assigned those two for loops too so then so you're kind of there but you're kind of there but um in the in the actual response what you would do and you're really close is you said loop through through the first frame and loop through a second array really what you would do is you look to the first array and you do use a dot push to push to another variable that you just created right let's just say the variable is called c and you do that push from first array to another another to that c uh variable and then you look at the second array b and you'll do a dot push from that array to then the c as well yeah okay no to the same to the same to the same c array right so that's how you merge them together you just print out c which can change both of them exactly exactly so that that's where i missed the push part you see someone's almost no you're really close so i think what where you're lacking right now is you're very close to kind of like what what you know you build a lot of projects you're liking some of the most fundamentals right yes you do need to know some um some what's it called some um algorithms algorithms and data structures right but that's mostly if you if you were to get a job at a company if you're if that's not your goal and you just want to go to freelancer route which i will tell you is not going to be easy right huh i don't expect you yeah it's not going to be i'd rather i'd rather earn that paycheck like like uh connolly's case where i start small and work my way up to where i can say hey i am but let me ask you a question let me question why are you so afraid to work in a company being disabled um one of my things is i don't deal well with uh being micromanaged and so a lot of the companies i've worked for at my age i'm 37 so when i was just still young i yeah oh thanks a lot when i was younger in my early 20s i actually had a job in the engineering firm and when i lost that job i got this big chip on my shoulder that i couldn't come overcome so i went through a bunch of jobs after that as a freelancer that i ended up not knowing then that i didn't like working for other people in corporations because i had no say i had no presence i was just a monkey monkey see monkey do and that's what i felt and so to go the freelance route would be i would have that sense of individuality that sense of control mmhmm and say hey hey nas i want to do this project for you cool let's let let's talk about it you know let's let's get this project done whereas you're telling me what you want i give you what you want but you don't hold all the power in that relationship it's a given time yeah and a corporation it's not really so much that when you're the new man on totem pole yeah you're you're expected to do with very little say so and that's what what is it what what's the most thing what's the most and this is for anybody here i'm very curious actually anybody here who's currently in in the zoom what's the most important what's the most important thing for you in terms of work hold on you're muted i can't hear you sorry my my shut off for me it's the freedom to again like how you and uh qazi started out it's the freedom to set my own projects to set my own rates to have that freedom where i control how much i want to work i want to work 60 hours a week cool i have the project signed up i can do that but i have the will the the freedom to decide and if a company comes along and says hey i want to offer you 100 grand a year i know i'm worth that i have the backing with all the projects i've done on say upwork and whatnot as a freelancer whereas right now i have no experience and a lot of times a lot of these companies are calling me up and i kid you not anybody in the zoo i've had plenty of people call me up off of linkedin i've got over 900 connections on linkedin and i have recruiters calling me every other day saying hey i have this i have uh i have this javascript uh full stack developer job i have this react developer job a remote so and they'll call me and say hey i have the senior developer job this junior developer job whatever but once they hear i don't have a degree and i don't have any experience goodbye it's not i see what you mean i see what you mean so degree and experience i think so look yes the degree portion is sometimes hard for but these companies right but what i'll tell you is that for example for me at this point i don't put my degree on the resume right right i've got i've got the experience the one year the one the first job experience at wherever i am right and then now it doesn't really matter what kind of it doesn't really matter what kind of experience what degree you have for you what i think is happening here is you're looking for the wrong jobs you're looking for you're looking for the wrong jobs so i think what you could do is yes you can start doing freelancing and you can you can go that route that is correct you should go that route and then um try to pursue that route right the second round that you should go through though is actually going to be is actually the route with one finding companies that are more so on the startup side because those companies give you a lot more freedom and those companies give you uh don't really care about about the degrees at all they give zero shits about that no i'm not kidding you i'm not they really don't care what degree you have or not they just want somebody to help them out and actually build stuff and on top of that you have a lot more leverage and a lot more freedom to build things that you want because your say has a lot in in that startup company's coming to you with yeah i need you to do for me exactly not oh you're just a part of the team exactly you're you're expendable even if that means that you wrote for free for a little bit like joseph you have to be open to that because i know you haven't worked for the past what i think you said six years or something right yeah you have to be open to even you know what hey guys i'll work for free for you for a little bit well i'm actually volunteering with inkscape right now beautiful so and they've already said you know they want to talk to me about an apprenticeship which is great and all but django is not my forte but i don't mind learning it and i'm open to giving up my time i'm okay with that yeah it's just i don't want to be taken advantage of yeah i get it i totally i totally get that and this is where this is where you learn how to set your boundaries and this is where you keep your options open because i still plan on finishing ul's boot camp for the five days i mean i still want to do it anyways yeah just more experience yeah and the homework gives me something to do yeah but how do you and i'm sure the other the other one in the zoom might see it as well but how do you avoid getting hit with uh learning a million things at once like for a lot of people who don't know programming html css javascript those are fundamentals yeah how do you not get sucked into we're gonna learn uh react we're gonna learn python we're gonna learn django we're gonna learn you focus on one you focus on one well it's but it's really not it's just discipline it's discipline well it's literally just discipline because joseph the thing is oh yeah if i was to give you tips i would give you a tip but the thing is like for example the tip for you would be like to find somebody who keeps you accountable may that be a mentor or somebody else cause somebody people do need for that right but it depends on how good you are with money like do you like for example if you can't spend money yourself and you can find a mentor that will keep you kind of make sure that you don't sway outside the box and that's maybe something you need even that's more or less like if you were to say hey joe i need a i need a html website by tomorrow morning at 11am you know and you you call me at 10 o'clock are you done yet or if i get stuck i can talk to you see that's what i'm looking for is more of a mentor but i haven't found anything i mean yeah i mean that's that's that's the hardest thing yes like without you trying to really talk about the opportunity of you know within how working or within clever programmer right which is that's what we do help our students with because i'm not trying to sell you on that that's part of one right though though you know like yes so we do offer that ability right of course especially as we get towards the end the boot camp we'll talk about that but yeah for those people who do need some little more discipline this is where you might need somebody somebody else's help right and if you think that you know what i can't afford somebody else's help then you just need to sit your butt down and write down things and just do it yeah that's that's that's a lot of people probably can relate to that yes honestly other than tutorial hell i'd say and maybe i'm wrong i'd say that's the hardest thing that really is the discipline this is this is where you know a mentor is so important and a structure right like for example when later on when we talk about the boot camp that we have for example you guys are able to potentially potentially join yes the thing that a lot of our students are requiring when they join is a structure right you right now go from the tour tutorial because there's a bunch of like tutorials and you know you don't really know what your structure is you don't have a problem roadmap am i right yep exactly yep so go ahead even with the boot camp it's still and i'm sure i think gavin's still in here and there's a few others that are in boot camps like flat iron or whatnot unfortunately even my own a lot of them were uh you're on your own pretty much that's unfortunate if you were like parttime basically you watch your videos you do this stuff on your own time and or or if you were fulltime you had to look up everything and it's all things you could have done without going to the boot camp yeah and that's where a lot of us are a lot of us grad your stuff no i get it i get it yeah this is where it you know you have to find the right opportunity and you're the right person to get you you just need to keep searching like well sorry sorry to bug you with a with a loaded question i'm sure everybody else has other questions yeah yeah no no it's not just more important no no no no other question is more important i think these are all good questions that definitely relate to a lot of people right i think you know the answer to this question is just simply like we just need to get started discipline get really disciplined and don't let yourself get swayed by other focuses right oh this is view just oh it's so good oh english is so good no if your focus is front development with javascript and react gs you stay focused on that and only that right if you find something exactly if you find something where you have a structure right a structure where they give you structure and you have to follow it follow that right so if you have the ability to invest yourself to do that do that right that's what i'm doing right now is i'm trying to sit down and uh like my wife would tell me is that i'm always doing what everybody else wants me to do and now i'm just going to sit down and do what i want to do become selfish yeah that's what she's basically saying be selfish and do the projects you want to do the way you want to do them yep exactly somebody will come along exactly and say hey i saw your projects what do you do i like that exactly that's it anyway i'll let you get back to the questions awesome joseph awesome thanks so thank you so much my friend okay i'll see you tomorrow yes see you tomorrow i love the npc okay all right well dude beautiful okay crush it again byebye all right awesome who's next guys who's next who was another question i think we had hi azam how you doing yo what's up yo what's up how are you doing my friend do you remember me from the last bootcamp i remember you how are you going awesome i actually completed my portfolio nice you did awesome sweet sweet sweet that's really cool do you have any questions for me my friend uh not really any questions okay can i should i drop the link in the chat you got your portfolio yeah drop the link in chat sure sure sure yeah is that trash firebase link gotcha gotcha oh good oh good yeah that's really cool i remember you from the last time that's really awesome we have a and how old are you again say get a song eight years old this guy has built so many products now at this point it's insane that's awesome that's awesome i love that did you drop did you drop the link or no yeah i'm i didn't drop it yet wait wait a second i just need to validate the link i'll go sorry i'll check everything before so see if it's right and i'll get to you guys and i'll get to all your questions as well guys okay and guys of course if you ever want a question of course feel free to raise your hand or put in the zoom chat if you if you have a question for me okay and i'll be able to get you and if you do have a question make sure your camera's turned on because i don't want to talk and i want to like you know it gets weird when you're just talking to a black box you know i dropped the link so it only goes to you so you'll have it in the chat i don't see it my friend oh it's like oh it's like that link okay let me see can i use that link you don't have to copy paste it in your browser let me see maybe we see you see it it's kind of there but it's also kind of broken so how does it look does it i think it's taking a while to load it's telling me how to load i mean i have like i have like a lightning fast computer so i i popped i popped over my brother boom i literally that's awesome that's awesome yeah for some reason i might have said that's not loading very much i don't know we might want to check that but yeah i want i think check that out and then and then we'll be able to get back to you next time okay but in the meantime just want to get to it anybody has a question okay yeah i even did algorithms like nice algorithm yeah then like i tried quick sort and then literally i i literally was just starting the loop and literally i filled yeah so the first thing i did was a bubble store algorithm in python and then i went on free code camp uhhuh i tried to and then it said told me you need to implement it in javascript i'm like oh my god i tried it i was like i was like this should work i i run the tests guess what only one of them all the touch pads nice that's awesome that's awesome that's awesome well keep trying okay keep keep working it okay my friend okay awesome good job azam keep doing keep do what you're doing i love it okay awesome who else has got another question guys okay let me see who's got back how are you doing my how are you doing back wait now hold on there's hold on i'm trying to click on it go ahead back you got it how do i what's wrong i can't hear you hello can you hear me yeah now you're good go ahead you can talk now i can barely i can barely hear you you got some weird sound like are you somewhere outside or no no oh now i can hear you there we go can you hear me now yeah i can hear you okay there we go it must have been my headphones okay it's so adorable do you need to know like ux ui design as a full stock developer do you need to no you really don't you don't you don't need that does not need to be your fullon priority um though as you start to build more applications you start to get much better at it because as a front developer you actually will be working a lot with with ui ux designers and so you will start to get a hunch of these ui ux designs right um and start to get more understanding like okay well this looks good and this looks good and this looks good um so most of the time what happens is you'll have a design in front of you and then you'll be able to ha and you'll have to know how to make it uh real basically on the web page does that make sense yeah awesome i've been like phoned a couple of things but i've not designed is just it's not my thing no don't worry about it if you focus on just taking any design and then building it you're good all right all right i like it i like it beautiful awesome nice question hector how are you doing how are you my friend hey uh i was wondering oh shoot what's up forgot my question it's all good happened come back to me in a bit all right all right all right all right i'll come back in a second here are you sure you can think about it for a second here no wait did you get it uh i remembered it last second okay so it are you if we get into the eight month program or would you help us find a job afterwards yes yes oh you would yep that that's what we do is we and we we actually partner up with uh with recruiting agencies to help you with that oh oh that's really nice all right yeah thank you make sense awesome awesome and what do you do right now hector uh right now i'm just saving up money to go to college i already graduated high school in 2020. nice but i have to take a gap year because i'm i'm not that rich so gosh i got you okay oh good i'm good and so you're not are you working anywhere right now or no at all i took a parttime job in order to save up money a little bit yeah nice that's good that's good that's good and so you know do you want to go fully to college or you kind of want to go a different route well i'm kind of exploring my options college is an option but again it's expensive so if i can find a way around that okay and just like get a job like straight up with that okay i'll take anything really all right awesome well i'm excited to have you here hopefully we'll see you in the boot camp okay thank you okay my friend good next question let's see who else got a question heber hi haber how are you doing wait wait there's so many people wait there we go add me to a spotlight too where am i where is nas did anybody see where i am okay thank you all right go ahead hubbard i can't hear you though no i can't hear you no change your microphone maybe no can't hear you can you guess here there we go nice awesome okay awesome sweet all right so i got a question so this um the five days that we're doing right so i'm also on your clever programming where i'm in front of the dashboard learning web development by building projects nice what do you think i should focus more on the five days or that or do i do it simultaneously as well wait what dashboard where are you at what do you mean um the clever programming site um um where it says uh learn web development by building oh there there no focus focus focus on focus on the 5day boot camp for now okay okay got it right and then of course and then later on you can focus on the learned uh by building projects okay cool so that's afterwards basically yeah right i mean you can i mean for some people they do it during they do it at the same time because like that learn development building projects has some good substance to it has really good like basic fundamentals you guys will get to learn right and so for example if you're waiting right now for tomorrow just go through a few videos and yes do them yeah yeah uh it looks interesting i already have um some um experience when it comes to that i actually took a boot camp literally a couple months ago really wasn't it wasn't quite what i was looking for why is that why is that um i just feel like it wasn't like it was the passion wasn't there but the instructor oh yeah yeah that that that's always that's always what gets you huh i felt like i was inside a college class yeah just lecturing but they weren't really answering the question gotcha yes giving this a go you know yeah i know are you currently working anywhere or no oh yeah i'm an assistant manager at olson so oh okay okay okay so your assistant manager and then why do you want to get to coding curious yeah it's always been my passion honestly really yeah creating something out of nothing i was a big tron fan i was younger trona fan that you said yeah tron have you seen the movie tron but the original i've seen the movie tron yeah yeah yeah so i was a big fan about that so that's something i always dreamed of doing and at the beginning when i first went to college because i dropped out of college i was majoring on life science my mother was a doctor in her country so it's something that i just wanted to do just to make it happen but that's my passion so just dropped out focus on what i'm working on right now and i told me i told myself that once i save money i'm going to go back to what i'm really passionate about i mean you can tell like i've been pranked out i love that i love the stuff behind your thing yeah so you know it's something that i really am looking forward to so i'm excited about this that's cool that's cool well i'm excited to have you here and then i'm sure you'll learn a lot of things here okay yeah yeah thank you man okay and i'll see you tomorrow 11am okay sure beautiful all right byebye all right next one who we got ma suhami is that right go ahead wait go ahead my friend hey guys hi how are you doing good doing how are you i'm fine uh i have a question that uh where can i deploy my website securely without paying any money uh netlify sorry can you natalify netflix i'll put in the chat okay so net le phi let me see i'll put you guys in the in the yeah another fight is going to be a good one for you guys okay thank you and the other question is if i join a 8month course then what i have to pay for that how much we'll talk more about that kind of uh you know we'll talk more about that on sunday for now so just stay focused on the bootcamp and then just take a look at kind of like if it's the right uh term for you okay um okay that's fine and if uh you told that that you guys will help us uh to get job after that good campaign but if uh i moved to canada or other country then are you guys still are you currently in usa or where are you at right now yes right now i'm in usa california but in 2022 i may be in canada maybe in canada okay so you might be in canada that doesn't matter that doesn't matter we we have students who are in london we have students who are in canada we have students who are in iran and we help them good to get jobs through there yeah yeah it doesn't matter as long as the most important thing is for to teach your skills and then and then the jobs will kind of kind of come through you i mean and of course through us by helping you um but yeah most important is going to be the skills that you get to learn and then of course we'll help you get the job and what do you what do you currently do uh i actually i'm an intern as a software developer in my startup company really yeah that's awesome and so and so like what do you do there like a front developer backing developer or what um the angular developer even using a file is for authentication and doing a google cloud for deploying websites that's cool that's cool that's awesome i'm just curious why did you think that you what was the goal to join like an eight month course what was the goal for that i want to become a full step developer okay and uh as i'm literally i i did a frontend developer for four months four years but i think it is just a few things to become a great it's not my career right i want to become a full tech developer front end it's nothing for me like i i'm thinking okay i like it yeah i think what you're doing right now is great is you start out with the front end and so like the next step for you to learn in the back is going to be like the back end so it's like to makes you like a fullon false developer so i think you're in a really good path uh and of course you already have a startup job which is great that's actually how i started at a startup company and then so the opportunity there at that point it's just pretty pretty amazing yeah but did you guys told in the uh in the class that javascript is very important yeah i think i'm still lagging in javascript even after having your four years of experience wow four years what are you doing here i'm just kidding just for friends gotcha still i'm thinking i'm not a pro in javascript i love it i love it that's awesome well i'm happy to have you you have an amazing smile and it looks like you have to make an amazing energy okay yeah just enjoy it be in the community and we'll see you tomorrow at 11 right beautiful awesome thank you all right next one go ahead and help me out with who's next let me see who else we got let me go here uh who's got yo dave dave go ahead dave dave leck let's see if we can spot feel free to unmute yourself go ahead hi david how you doing you had a question for me well i just wanted to say hello and enjoyed all your videos here and uh um learning a lot in full stack mastery beautiful beautiful what kind of project you're building right now um i'm still working on that project we talked about oh that project nice nice nice nice he's building a crossword plot no not a crossover is it critical what is it called crosstalk advanced connect advanced connect which is like a big crossword uh what's it called puzzle it's like a tic tac toe but you have to connect x amount of pieces in yeah in line it's built all in react but in the same sense it'll have chat and it allows up to like x amount of players and the person who creates that game will set the options and boundaries for that game that's awesome i love it i love it i love it that's really cool yeah i mean keep doing that we would love to see it in the boot camp at some point here or in this even in this koni bootcamp okay but at the same time i just got done with that hard part of postdeck mastery by the way no oh really yep let's go over to the we're over to the fun part now oh okay the react.js portion yep yeah yeah you just got done with the fundamentals that's awesome yeah for sure for sure yeah just so you guys know dave luck is actually in the full semester here but uh in the booth game here and uh yeah been developed for how many years now you are uh 20 10 years with the web but i am still learning a lot even as a experienced developer there's stuff in there that i haven't even heard of before that i'm learning about that's good i'm happy to hear that i'm happy to hear that awesome dave i'm gonna go give uh some other people who are even you know to ask questions okay but thank you so much for jumping on okay yep thank you dave bye bye all right who's next all right lewis how are you doing my friend hello hold on let me go ahead and let you unmute yourself go ahead my bad oh good good who are you doing good how are you yeah i'm doing well being in new york and uh you're in new york yeah i'm in queensland i'm actually about 60 minutes away from jfk oh they i love that okay okay okay awesome so what's your question my friend so i just had a quick question right because i i mean i did a lot of vmware support uh cisco uh domain deployment and support but never kind of worked on on the software side right software development on it so but that's always something that had me interested um so i'm kind of starting up right now so what are some of the things that uh i would need to kind of look at in order for me to uh get better at uh understanding and doing things yeah from scratch because that's one of the things like a lot of people uh doing projects from scratch it's a little bit of a problem but yeah i love baseball right and and we do have a site for the team but it's very basic and so one of the things that i was i wanted to do was basically look at code and basically update the site to look and feel better have better functionality and uh so so what are some of the things that uh i could do in order to improve myself uh you know to move forward okay good question good question so let me first ask you this question like why why do you want it back in to go into coding because when i brought you what did you say you were doing right now um i was doing a lot of uh vmware and do you work at a company do you work for a company right now uh no they all the jobs they move them out to either texas india or uk and i was not moving out there oh wow that's because i have family i mean i well i have one kid already out of college but my daughter still has two more years of college so i i opted to take a package instead so i wanted to do this because it gives me a lot more flexibility as far as where i can work with i can work from anywhere yeah i do something like this i love you know technology but this is something that i think anybody can do from anywhere it doesn't matter where you live right so it gives you more uh that time for you to spend with your family but also you know do the things that you like to do and that's something that i love to do that's right and it will give me a lot more freedom and you know i could just retire now but i can't just sit home uh you're antsy you're antsy you're like i can't say it i need something to do right so and that's something that's interesting and you know i love baseball and i wanted to kind of help the team to even improve the site nice how it looks and and you know start working on different projects moving forward okay but that's one of the things that i wanted to do and i want to get really good at it um i do have a lot of time on my hands so i can so one of the things i want is more or less have an idea what things i can i can focus on to to get better at it and move forward from there so so good question i think i think for you to number one is i think you're in a good place right now with for example even kind of being in this community right where we'll give you we will give you some structure around you know these next five days but after these next five days um i think if you're going to focus on the front end for example then yes you want to focus on for example these technologies like like html like css and javascript most importantly what you want to focus on is learning those kind of fundamental parts of the coding portion right so you kind of want to get yourself really really good with you know different types of you know problems that you that come with you know with coding right now the question might be okay where do i see those problems or where did i get those problems right a few things the way you get those problems is actually by for example just kind of how you said looking at the project that you had which is your baseball project right and actually looking to fix it right and figure out how to do it you know like this the learning process here is almost like have havoc a little bit here sometimes you know sometimes it's not doesn't have to be so structured it doesn't have to be so point by point by point instead it's sometimes can be more on the side of okay i have a problem ahead of me let's figure out what how do i get how do i solve it so for example yeah go ahead no no go ahead so so for example in your case if you for example have a website in front of you and you're like okay well i'm gonna update it here's my process how would you i would look like edit like that i would say okay so how do i want to update how do i want to update my site so the first question i'll ask myself how do i want to update my site right and i will literally draw out things that i want to change to it i will draw or literally take a piece of paper now draw it out in terms of how do i want it to change how do i want it to look like okay right so that'll be the first step i would take okay that gives me some visual around what needs to happen okay then the second thing that i would do after that point is okay so i've got that visual now at this point i would actually i don't know where your site is for example loaded my goal next goal would be okay how can i get a hold of that site and how can i get a hold of that code right instead of my next task okay so my next step is like okay well i've got this website that's currently there where can i see the code that's your task number two my test number three at that point okay great so now do i have that what do i need to do where in the code or how do i need to change it up in terms of the code on the coding portion now this is where you might be stuck am i right yes okay so now at this point where okay you have to there's two steps the first step is that you just kind of divide your little problem into small pieces and you think and you ask yourself the questions okay okay let's just say you need to change the header right you figure out okay how do i change the header in a website so you go to google okay creating a header and a website you type in creating header for a website and you start to see code you start to see people doing different types of headers right right right you start to see different examples and you implement that right that's your first pathway so kind of like more so backtracking right you have the problem or you're trying to go backtrack from it the second pathway is okay i see what i need to do i'm going to give it a pause and instead i'm going to learn some basic things around coding so maybe i would go to free code camp and i'll learn some basic html some basic css and some basic javascript okay because there are pathways to that right and then at that point what i might do is maybe after that what i might do also is maybe i might at the same time i might join a five day coding bootcamp which you are in right now and so now i'm going to try and apply those skills to my html css skills to javascript right right i'll now learn how to create a simple website or apply those skills sorry apply those skills to the website not javascript but go to the website so now maybe you'll learn how to build a few projects with me right now it's time to apply that knowledge towards other things by yourself i gotcha and so that's the process i would take make sense thank you that makes sense makes sense thanks thanks a lot for the uh the explanation i think you know putting a big problem into into small pieces yeah it is uh it becomes easier to um actually uh correct 100 100 literally just like whenever i one of the biggest things that i know as a good developer that uh like my strength my strength as a developer is being able to take a big plot problem and then split up into multiple pieces thank you that's a lot of people are struggling with guys a lot of you people on zoom right now on youtube that's your struggle right but that's actually a biggest game changer for any developer like i have managers who would come to me like jonas can you come you know can you come into the room because there's a bunch of these you know uh business people and and even developers and nobody knows how to solve something that's because you guys are looking too much from a higher point of view and this is one humongous problem it's like for example if you were to build a building if you're building a building and all you saw was just a huge building you need to build people like holy how am i supposed to do this true but versus if you were to build a building you you start out from okay well let's first build the structure of the building the foundation be beside behind the layer last time build the beams okay then let's go ahead and build the walls around it right and then we can build the things on the inside right so like it's it becomes a lot easier right right so that's i want to think of this that's how you think of coding as well cool cool awesome lewis thank you much okay awesome louis well i'll see you tomorrow at 11am psc okay indeed we'll be there okay byebye have a good day byebye thanks next up let's see uh alex go ahead what's up nice little bit over facebook all right man all right oh yeah alex alex bishop as a right yeah hey let's go okay awesome man so i got some questions and i know uh we can't cover everything in five days obviously of course not are we going to go over like algorithms and uh algorithms and uh like database stuff and stuff like that or so yes we will call it that's going to be in like the we will cover databases so the data structures that's an eight month course okay but we will cover some databases because again it's really hard to just to cover all of that in these these next few these next five you know these next four days you know or even the three days of coding it's really hard to do that um right but we will cover like for example data structures like arrays and objects and we will cover databases like firebase as well it's cool makes sense and then yeah so most importantly i think you'll just see the possibilities that you can have with coding and then you'll be able to actually build something fully by yourself as well to be like oh i can actually do this you know what i mean so you kind of you kind of you kind of see in the big picture and then we'll step back and be like okay let's make this big picture so solid and let's start building those building blocks one by one sounds good man sounds good sounds good to me awesome where you where are you from alex i'm in jersey you're in jersey really well so many people from new york and new jersey i don't know what what are you guys all doing here i understand like so many students are from that from that side you know yeah man yeah man all right you know we're all trying to make it over there and what are you currently doing how it's going jacob what are you currently doing i'm a volunteer firefighter and i uh oh yeah that's right yeah you're a firefighter right and so you want to eat why did you want to switch the career uh it's dangerous work for one um two like it like i said before like it's not really thoughtprovoking work it's kind of just like you do the same thing over and over uh you are solving problems but you know it's kind of like it's in a different sense and yeah you know i i kind of prefer this kind of stuff um you know i've tried to do my own like small projects and stuff like that gotcha and uh yeah man it's pretty that's cool so so what was the what's the reason now to get into coding um well like i said i like to build my own projects uh i have like a lot of ideas um i'm also uh an entrepreneur like i run like a stock market group oh no way really yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm going to stock market as well oh okay yeah cool yeah one thing to make a lot of money is uh algorithmic platforms oh i just said you know um that are like even you buy and sell signals like something i want to build on my own because you get a quote from some of these places they're charging you like 25 000 for a project like that you're kidding really yeah man yeah it's expensive so uh yeah that's basically kind of what what i'm looking at like my own like my own projects and working you know fulltime job so that's awesome that's sweet oh well you know i'm pumped to have you here you know i think it's really cool that you're doing this the fact that you're putting the time into it and you're working hard towards it i'm excited to see what you do in these next three days give it your all and show me what you got serious awesome all right alex i'll see you tomorrow at 11 okay see you then okay byebye okay next up let me see uh let's see let's see raising your hand for quite a while now go ahead hey how you doing doing good how are you my friend i'm good i'm good but wait guys as you as you guys come up just uh say where you're from and then say your question okay go ahead okay so i leave in um elgin illinois like chicago area okay yeah so um i'm a college student uh community college uh um like i wanna i wanna get a bachelor's degree in computer science but i currently work out of where so like i i don't really like it and uh wait hold on hold on hold on hold on uh how do i remove share screen thank you okay thank you all right go ahead abe yeah like i said um i currently work at a warehouse and i don't really like it and uh towards the fall semester i want to i don't want to work at a warehouse anymore probably do like some freelancing so i could focus more on school because i have like a sponsorship right now for school so well i just need sponsorship from where sponsorship from where oh i have uh i have someone from my um because i'm muslim so like there's a man at my masjid and my musk was trying to sponsor me for school so uh but i need time like to study so i don't want to like spend because i work eight hours so i don't want to do that anymore so i've been i've been studying on my own i i think i'm pretty good at html and css but like the javascript is just giving me like a little bit yeah this is this is and then it's okay so okay awesome so what's your question what do you want to know so first of all is like this homeworks like so according to what uh is it cassie was saying yeah like all we just have to do is change the the picture and um and uh and and like the skill right yeah the skills and the picture and any other information that pertain more so to you oh okay and another thing is like with this with this five because i'm just trying to get some practice in okay you know maybe maybe see if i could understand javascript more because i'm currently learning from like a book okay this book right here it's not a bad book actually yeah like it's it's pretty good and but but it's boring i i'm kind of and another thing is i'm kind of scared like i don't know should i say scared or i'm like maybe when i'm done i might not be there or when i'm done with the book because i already finished up to like almost 400 pages but then it's like i don't know i'm trying to get some practice in with you guys so i don't know do you think i'm gonna be like okay with this by by this five days like if i put into work and then get some practice in or let me ask this question right so it's what you're looking for is just permission right do you believe that you'll you'll learn or that you will be okay uh that's the thing i don't know i think i think if i put in more work like if i put in a lot of work yeah like nothing is impossible of course there you go there's your answer does your answer there really my friend yes at the end these five days you will have three projects all they're going to use html css and javascript and so yes of course you'll be a lot better but it doesn't stop there right well a lot you got a lot of you guys need to understand is it's is that you cannot um you cannot rely on html css somebody calling what is this what's the name that's not me it's not you okay at the time please record your message and if that's recording press one for more options so um but yeah i think html css should not be your focus right now yeah i know that's what i'm saying like javascript is where i'm having like problems so i'm guessing if i could like get some things from this 5d well yes of course plus did you get the free course that we have if you when you join or no uh no so we basically when you join we get a you get a 11hour course that that's that's part of it as well right so if you don't i think are you in our texting community uh texan yeah i think i got a message from you get a message okay awesome so make sure there and just say hey can i get the course as well um okay my most important thing for you guys is going to be the following you you need to take every single project that we currently give you and modify it and then learn how to modify it right right your yes you'll build three projects but it's not gonna stop there that's not the only thing you need to do then you need to go back and learn the fundamentals and start doing projects for yourself so one of the biggest things that i think you can do after this korean boot camp right is actually going to be to is actually going to be hey you know what um let me think of a project that i can build by myself like what's a project that can help other people that you have always wanted to do any idea potentially have i mean i was thinking of getting like a website for my barber i just for who for my barber for your barber i get my yeah bro there you go no that's perfect go up to your barber and say hey you know what i got i'm learning how to code can i build a website for you like how much purpose would that give you yeah i'm just yeah i'm trying to get something real you know what i'm saying and if i could get from there maybe just like i know a couple restaurants around me that don't have a website as well and i was just looking up something and it says like just just make it for him and just tell him you know what i'm saying so i don't know be like yo you know i'll get give me some free haircuts and i'll build your website you know okay so i also i also heard like uh i think one of the guys you spoke to i forgot his name he was talking about something and then you told him to like pause for a little bit and then focus more on this fiveday coding bootcamp is that is that the 11hour course you were talking yeah that's the one i was talking about yeah oh okay okay okay oh did you say like i would get a text or what do i have yeah just text us the number that we texted you text says hey can i get access to the course okay okay thank you thanks a lot awesome that's my question i really appreciate like i'm really pumped i really want to get into this that's awesome i'm watching you guys video even with uh with the other guy from the uk i forgot his name uh sunny um yeah sunny i watch his videos as well i don't put along but usually like when i'm at work i'm just thinking about it and just watching these videos well i want to make sure guys don't it's not just about the watching just co actually do code along okay very important no matter who you're watching him or us or any other channel code along right because you can't drive a car but listening how to drive a car you can't learn how to drive a car if you just listen if somebody tells you okay now you gotta turn the wheel you know to left like it doesn't work that way you know like that's because i'm focusing more on the book and i just watch that while i'm at work or something just to engage my mind but you know i don't want to be all around the place like that's good that's good that's good too so if you're focusing on that book then focus on the book yeah if that's good too i see what you mean if you're focused on the book then yeah focus on the book and then of course you know you can sway a little bit for example if you're on this fiveday coding bootcamp where you're learning javascript html css it's a good avenue because you're now going way too far i lost the book right now i'm gonna i'm gonna put the book away for now okay i feel i have a good feeling about this to be honest good awesome well well let's see what you got i'm really excited for you to build these next three projects and just have fun and i'll i'll see what you got for the for the projects and how your skills are okay awesome okay have a good day i'll see you tomorrow at 11am okay all right next question neo hi again uh so i was just wondering i was looking at the facebook group i can't find the post for where we're submitting so amanov a month who's actually in here he's gonna as soon as we get off this call he's gonna he's gonna make the post okay okay awesome to submit it it's on uh air air table so there will be a link you guys will submit the link to there and then you guys will also post it as a facebook comment okay so there will be a post so and then in that facebook account just uh make it make a facebook come underneath that post okay guys okay make sense um so and then uh so the link to air table will also be on facebook right yes okay perfect yes awesome cool all right next up we have joseph hi joseph how you doing doing good how are you good good i'm from california oh no way okay let's go california i have like one question um okay do we have to use you guys project a portfolio project if you already have one mate cause i've been coding bootcamp right now no it's fine that's fine no it's fine if you if you have another portfolio just use that one it's all just for anybody who doesn't have a portfolio okay yeah that was the only cool question awesome sweet and what how how long you been cutting now um since march well i started in 2019 but i stopped cuz that kid and then um i started this bootcamp in march and then i had to graduate from the front end next month and then back in august oh dang that's sweet that's weird that's sweet and so what do you currently do all right now just i'm getting unemployment so i just like every day i'm coding for like 15 hours a day you know hey that's what i'm talking about i'm staying busy that's good and what are you like what do you know so far um i know bootstrap react uh react native um do you know javascript oh yeah javascript yeah okay i'm like yes you jump you jump like you know okay i still wanna you know progress in javascript because like like the promises are kind of tricky a little bit mmhmm so what else what else is tricky for you i'm just curious like what what else do you know for example did crazy data structures like linked lists and stacks and queues uh no see they didn't go over that everything would just be like from free code camp or like something else i'm doing stuff like that if i told you about the project joseph from scratch can you build it um i might be able to okay in advance yeah yeah focus on that okay joseph focus on that okay don't get too caught up in the fancy fancy react.js react native stuff you shouldn't even be doing regulator right now i don't really like reactivated yeah i don't like it at all you shouldn't even be doing it you you honestly should be focusing more so on the fundamentals and actually building stuff for yourself yeah i've been building i built a a weather app by myself and uh okay on todo list all through react nice and right now i'm working like on an informational website react nice and you're selected and you fully came up with this with the idea and you fully put them over yourself and you're just copying good that's awesome yeah it's good good good yeah and that gives you a good track good okay okay yeah awesome any other questions for me um i'm probably looking to get in the into the eight month uh boot camp as well i want to keep going you know keep going i love that i love that awesome well we'll see you throughout these next four days and yeah just have fun enjoy it and then uh we'll see you there okay okay sounds good alright i'll see you tomorrow 11am pst all right byebye okay awesome sweet next one uh and thingy mckenzie is that right go ahead anthony yeah yeah that's right how you doing nice how are you doing anthony i'm doing good i'm feeling good man i appreciate all the knowledge you're drafting man you got it i'm always here for you guys nice nice i just had one question um for the 11 hour free course that we got um is it only for the five days or is it um um no i think i think you just get it pretty much forever oh for real wow wow yeah okay nice yeah yeah i appreciate it yeah you got him a friend what are you where are you currently at where are you from um from toronto toronto all day and then what do you currently do uh right now i'm just um like working at a warehouse i'm just trying to like it's not really a career you know it's just kind of to get by but my main focus right now is to get into this um web development gotcha gotcha and then why why so i'm curious why so um i've been like uh ever since 2019 i kind of like i i found out about like qazi and i've been like seeing the python videos and stuff and just like just seeing how that's where the world's going right now like with the future like everything's kind of going on the web and like especially with like this corona stuff like everyone's working from home so it's just like i feel like it's like one of the most valuable skills to like you know for the for the present and the future right now right do you like let me ask you this like so okay so it's it's good for the future like do you enjoy it yeah like i enjoy like um because i spend a lot of time on the computer anyway so uhhuh it's like um like i like the like creative aspect of it where it's like you know you could use your imagination and like kind of just um like put put your thoughts onto like a computer basically into action pretty much okay that's cool that's awesome well i'm happy to have you here hope you enjoy these next these next four days and build some amazing projects my friend okay definitely definitely thank you all right and i can see you tomorrow 11 and pst okay sounds good all right sweet all right next one let's see holly hi holly hi hi how are you doing hello um good um yeah um i'm from melbourne australia australia no way yeah my actual my coach is from australia actually okay go ahead um so yeah my questions is like um i i feel like all the information is um on the facebook group and i've been like trying to join for quite a couple of times and i don't know why it's not been approved then you mentioned um i think with hobby previously okay the text message as well okay i tried to send text messages like i don't get any response either okay is it is it because i sent from an office's number not a us number i don't i don't know honestly but yeah if you're in the facebook group amano can you help out and just approve holly that'll be great yeah yeah because i'm just like there's a lot of information in the group and kind of missing out with whatever yeah yeah she has been doing because i think that's gonna be the main channel okay okay awesome yeah definitely yeah i think we'll be able to help you out i just will prove you okay okay great awesome any other questions um maybe it's just about the javascript um is that any particular like like i know there's a lot of kind of javascript so which one that we go to it like hidden first and what's gonna be like the next one i think i think for you the most important thing is i just focus just on the first javascript just like a javascript itself html css the other stuff like regis just keep that on the focus for later okay okay and molly holly what do you what do you currently do i'm actually a python developer wait what yeah i'm a python developer but you know python when we do front end stuff we just for me myself i just use like a ginger template so i'd like to upskill myself okay um for javascript skill so you know i can i can be like a truly full stack okay and so do you currently have a job as a python developer yeah i work fulltime so i kind of like challenged myself to try to join with this one i know you guys face in your ass when we started it was like 4 00 am here so i try like okay i'll wake up early for the next one i can make it work um right but then another thing the good thing is because you guys like at the other side of the world like it's not within my working hour yeah yeah yeah that's true after we finish this call i'll jump right into my my my work as well but luckily like my work is fully remote so it's good i guess i just need to manage my time awesome well well i'm excited to have you here to build some projects okay yeah awesome holly thank you so much we'll have a good day i'll see you tomorrow 11 a.m okay yeah byebye cheers awesome up next who else we got we got robbie go ahead wait aren't you charles wait wait that's robbie never mind robbie hi hi robbie hey how's it going uh i'm from florida uh i have a just a couple quick questions about the uh the eighth month uh boot camp okay um eight months is obviously a lot of time yes uh it's six to eight months okay cool is that something that you need to like dedicate like fulltime hours to like go to is it like a 40hour kind of week kind of thing how does it work so uh for the for that one basically no you don't you do not need to dedicate uh 40 hours uh actually about 80 of our current students have a fulltime job and so you probably will be dedicated time basically about 20 hours of work a week and it's mostly time after your work so do you currently have a fulltime job right now yeah i work fulltime and i'm i'm technically working now you're working where what's your current job i do tech support tax support oh yeah okay i remember that yeah that's right um so yeah like for example for example our coaching calls that in this the the six to eight months boot camp the goal is for students who are people who currently have have a job right so the goal for that will be you'll be joining coaching calls after 5 pm pst which what time zone are you in eastern eastern so your time will actually be 8 p.m okay and it's about like you'll be having around four coaching calls a week okay okay okay does that make sense yeah that makes sense my only other question was i see that there is financing available which is fantastic do you guys also take like fafsa or any kind of federal aid we don't do unfortunately we don't i wish we did you know but no boot camp is able to do that because they're not like university you know for the university so uh we just kind of you know we just kind of teach you the things that you should learn that's it you know so yeah yeah gotcha well that was it for me i appreciate it awesome thank you robbie have yourself a good ever so good day and we'll see you tomorrow right yes sir i'll be there all right awesome we'll see you tomorrow all right next up let me see who's next who's next uh any other anybody had any questions any questions uh let me see let me see keep going keep going all right cool cool cool cool we have we have ahmed how are you doing my friend hello hello oh yo wait no hold on what you want i'll call you on your next okay you're on ahmed hi hi almond how are you doing how's everything uh just i have to ask you first uh am i allowed at this video call because um uh actually i'm from lebanon and i had to turn on the vpn so oh yeah i know i know i know how that works out yeah yeah i get it okay hello oh no am i am i allowed or should i leave no you're allowed why because the zoom is not letting me letting me in oh really really no it's all good just stay on it's fine okay and uh i was very excited i i submitted like to the facebook group like for five uh for four to five times and uh unfortunately i'm not getting accepted okay okay well uh i think maybe uh um can help us out okay okay um my first question is i really want to know what's my what's my what's my level like i the the main the main purpose for getting me in in javascript is i i like very much to solve problems and one of the problems that i solved is that i i did i did a tool that evaluate all the courses in in my university because the the university i'm in can't let you show your grades in in your courses unless you evaluate all the courses really yes and to evaluate all the courses it takes a lot a lot a lot of time wow that's crazy i like like like imagine you're registered for eight courses and you have to evaluate all the courses too to see your grades that's not fair yeah that's crazy i i i made a tool uh that that makes you evaluate all the courses in like seconds like if you if you don't like the course you you registered just like but number one and the javascript will evaluate all the courses when the instructors know i know about it they said what did you do what did you do with the with the system i didn't do anything the chrome just did google chrome that's funny they thought like i i just want to know what what's my level um i i did i did i did like five to six to six to six projects um one of the one with john so look your level your level is still junior level but you're on a good junior level so you're a good junior level developer right now you'll become more advanced as you actually work at a company okay okay great okay got it so right now you're junior level but you've got some really solid knowledge and so for you getting the job we wouldn't be that bad uh okay uh i'm uh i'm a computer science undergraduate i uh i still have like one year until i graduate okay that's fine that's fine yeah that's fine i mean just keep searching for job and so forth okay okay great like uh if i if i go on with your course like the eight months the eight months course i'm in lebanon um how can i get how can i benefit from it like of course it can benefit i can benefit a lot from its knowledge but how can i get like jobs abroad abroad well okay so for one thing is abroad jobs is is i know for example you know it might be harder for you for example because you're in different country right here's what i'll tell you though right is nowadays because because of the internet right because of what you know it's really just comes down to your skills right a lot of companies are searching for remote work you know and even for example right now temporarily you try to do freelance work which you still can right no matter where you're from you can find those jobs you see what i mean and for there are a lot of companies who are just hiring you know outside outside for example people people you know uh you know from other countries right doesn't really matter as long as you have good skills but i i know it's i know unfortunately the way the world is is it is harder for those who are outside like us or outside you know these these countries and i totally get it and i wish it was different um i think in your terms it's just going to be basically you trying even harder to get those to get jobs as freelancing jobs just to get jobs even in either in your country or to get jobs that are remote work you know in other countries does that make sense yes should i focus a lot like on linkedin yes of course focus on linkedin most importantly focus on building your skills on building my skills and do you think i should go through a tutorial once and i should go i should go on my own yeah the building projects 100 100 building projects and then at that point start doing linkedin and then you should be doing like some freelance work right now as well create a uh create your own portfolio on freelancer or somewhere else and start start doing a work through there okay okay thank you okay awesome thank you ahmed have yourself a good day we'll see you tomorrow at 11 okay all right awesome okay okay cool cool sweet next one yolan hi ewan how are you doing hi i'm doing good okay you had a question for me where are you from yes um canada oh a lot of you are from canada hey let's go canada oh canada go ahead i can't hear you you're muted i think you muted your mic no i can't hear my friend something happened where your headphones just got screwed up sorry i can't hear you know no can't hear you all good how about this just come back in a second here okay fix your microphone and the media will take someone else neal yeah another question neil a lot of questions huh yeah well i wanted to ask you i see that uh music hardware in the background are you a music producer this yeah well or maybe that's not me i'm a parttime dj parttime developer now i'm just kidding well no it's because like for example when i coach or when i do these live calls right i do these things right and i control this and i did we have podcasts of course and so it allows me to do a lot of controlling a lot of that stuff but if i say that the funniest say do i do this right or if i for example you know what i do like podcasts hey what's up everybody hope you guys are in the mail this is nas and today we are having a coding show on clubhouse let's go and get started right so it's like it's yeah it's basically allows me to do a lot of youtube stuff and uh just have fun with it that's awesome what's that thing called it's called road caster pro okay yeah road caster pro check it out it's really really cool it's like you can do podcasts and it's kind of connected to your computer it's a lot of fun i love it that's sick awesome cool neil is that your correction cool awesome right next up uh derek go ahead hi derek how are you doing my friend hold on um hear me now yeah yeah i can hear you what's up wow man this cp team is so awesome the whole team rafi sonny all y'all but what's cool um i learned the um algorithms back in the early the early 1980s from a book called c brian kernerjee and dennis ritchie okay you learned uh linked lists um the bubble sort oh the good stuff huh so i've been out of programming then i got into basic i made the pacman game in 1983. nice i love it uhhuh right then i got no hardware i was doing i'm right now fix computers right now but um i've been doing javascript websites for 20 years whoa a lot right i mean from the php to the asp to java um uh my sql database but the question was concerning databasing i've watched you and um sonny and y'all um uh qazi on the back end using firebase i heard about google firebase well actually um i got an angular a little while ago but i got out of angular it was too too hectic at the angular angle okay okay but when i seen you what guys um do react i fell in love with react nice because i'm a job a javascript neck i like nice but for the databasing um could you recommend or not i mean not recommend the mongodb on the back end and also what about the um node server with um express is that relevant right now because i see you build some sites without node and express and uh mongodb i mean i guess firebase has everything right for the back end backing packing services right yeah well let me ask that question really simple yeah mongodb and node are very very popular languages and frameworks and you should learn them period right yep we use fibers because it's also very easy right and it's very simple and it gets the point across but like it or not mongodb and you know mongodb and for example and node.js if you look at indeed.com if you look at the jobs and what they're looking for they're still one of the most popular jobs like they still very much need it wow great great great great got it and where are you from dave where you from by the way i'm not from um d.c oh dc washington d.c nice next connections capital right very nice and one other quick question um um um your your course coming up for the eight months course yeah um how can you uh er er enroll to the course i mean like so how do you how can your roles are very easy right basically this is like this is going to be your test these next few days so on sunday you guys will get the chance to enroll and apply okay great there's an application process and then we go through the application process and we see you know not everybody gets in right but we go to the application process and basically and then we we see kind of how you guys do and so forth and then and then we kind of let you uh come in okay great great sounds good sounds great okay awesome my friend okay cool and then so what do you currently have a job or you currently work or not right now i got my own business i do computer i'm an it net where i do computer repairs nice i build websites i mean basic websites i mean many front end not not too much back in but you know um and that's basically it you know nice and what and what and what's your goal and what's your goal with what's your goal with coding i guess or with full stack development well basically i'm trying to get into react so i can do the four stack but um eventually i want to get into mobile app development nice i did start off with native script but if you know about uh a native script um mobile app development it's kind of like a hybrid similar to react native and everything right a lot of javascript mmhmm i gotcha i know i was talking about okay right right so i guess i'm trying to get into mobile app development probably by next by 2022. okay okay dang that's awesome that's awesome i mean yeah there's this world is very much is going very high on the mobile development side and there's a lot of demand for it as well now with the mobile apps um you know there's two platforms apple and android yes and on one side you have java that is what it is swift right right right swift right but what about the react native it's more of a hybrid between both of them so react react native react natively uses javascript to basically create both for both android and for ios so yes right now there's a lot of possibilities around it for example there's other applications that are actually built with react native like i don't know if you guys know but the tesla application which i even have on my side right that itself is like built with react native wow yeah amazing amazing yeah so so definitely definitely look uh look into that one and then um there's just there's a lot of possibilities and it's because josh is becoming so so so much more um popular right it's getting a lot a lot stronger as well and so that actually allows us that allows these these you know you know uh what's it called devices to actually run them and so at some point i definitely foresee a future where all your apps are actually built in javascript right i mean a javascript is everywhere i mean anytime you have a web it's everywhere yeah exactly exactly right so and one last question i guess your course i missed your course last year i was very busy the profit with javascript okay i mean it's um that course are still available is it what the javascript yeah it's still available it's still available 100 so how can we find um i found that link um on your page go to go to cleverprogram.com and there will be a link over there okay great okay good okay just scroll down and then i mean amanda thank you if you could put the link down in the in the chat that'll be great okay great sounds good nice awesome thank you derek cp number one thank you let's go awesome guys hey saeed i like it guys with this one guys this has been a lot a lot a lot of fun guys um there's a lot of q a you guys love these q and a sessions yeah a lot of q and a sessions no hi get a question and one last question yeah what's the question but um make sure to unmute yourself okay okay can you hear me yeah i can hear you i have a disability and i haven't worked for 20 years okay how will i get hooked up with um not an internship but an apprenticeship so how do you open the apprenticeship um well that really depends on like what you're looking for so i think in your case it will actually be for example it'll just be contacting companies honestly like content companies like for example content companies and there's it just asks if you can do an internship with them internship or an apprenticeship like for you either through that or a lot of are you anywhere near for example a college campus yeah yeah a lot of accomplished campuses here have like those career what's it called those career um career days right you know what i'm talking about yeah everything yeah i wish college college campus has a career day definitely go the career day and see if you can throw potentially if you can just if you could just start to network with people most importantly back what you need to do right now is start networking may that be through online or on purpose or in person without with other people um in the development community okay okay check out meetups.com meetups.com no one down here involving you're in kentucky well there's right now medium.com with online online videos.com so you can you can meet people online huh not even online but i guess i could do it myself yeah yeah even online like meetups.com yeah like go to meetups.com and then actually find meetups in san francisco but they are online hey let's go by the way but yes awesome okay do that okay that's awesome awesome thank you one more quick one yeah what's up like the fundamentals of javascript right i got html css the next step would be javascript yes that's the most important one that's the most important one along with a lot of others yes all right got it i like your energy back all right awesome guys at that point that's pretty much it from me for those of you on youtube guys thank you so wait thank you so much for watching those are on youtube wait what's up one more one more okay you on okay go ahead you want can you help me yourself now hold on let me let me let me show you hold on let me get your mute go ahead i knew yourself hello yes go ahead hi um i just wanted to ask what i should learn next because i have learned html css and javascript i also learned react and i don't know like what's the next step so i want to know what i should learn next to become like a full stack how old are you right now oh i'm 12. i like it so look you don't need to learn more things next what you should be doing right now is building more projects okay okay forget just practice what you pre what you learn right now with react.js with javascript and actually like like let me ask you a question like why are you encoding um i'm coding because it's it's fun i like doing it and also yeah i really like doing it and it's fun that's good so how about this how about you build some fun projects have fun with it okay okay build some fun projects and then let's see what that leads you maybe that will lead to something else who knows maybe that'll lead to machine learning who knows but but build some fun projects and then just keep exploring you at the age of 12 those of you guys are eight years old 12 years old you guys are in the perfect phase you guys are living your parents home you don't have to pay for anything you get food thrown at you right you know what i mean so like enjoy this time and honestly just have fun and build some amazing projects by yourself fully and like and i honestly just make others with friends around the two okay got it yeah awesome thank you one i'll see you tomorrow at 11 am pc okay all right beautiful all right one last question neil you had another one neil what was the other question you got you had neil what's up neo hey what's up so um you were talking about uh we uh you'll evaluate uh on sunday or not on sunday but like on sunday

it's good to hear okay awesome neil cool thank you awesome guys all right guys at this point that's pretty much it for me guys holy moly we've been done three hours of of uh of stuff of q as you've done uh a lot of learning about the opportunity to become a developer there's a lot more comment is next four days so stay tuned um on that that's pretty much it from uh from me and from cleverprogrammer team yeah hope you guys have a great day and then we'll see you guys when we'll see you when tomorrow at 11 a.m pst i'll see you guys there all right hey have yourself a great day
