15:47 - server let's go ahead and literally get
15:49 - this stuff get this stuff going okay oh
15:52 - i'm here
15:53 - so inside server.js guys you know first
15:55 - things first when you create
15:56 - a when you are creating a node.js
15:58 - application which who
15:59 - who dropped in the comments if you know
16:01 - what kind of node.js is
16:02 - very important okay if you know what
16:04 - node.js is drop it in the comments
16:06 - below um and yes we are using webrtc by
16:09 - the way yes we are using rtc yes
16:12 - okay hold on hold on
16:16 - by the way is everything okay with our
16:18 - our stream it looks like i think i think

16:35 - then inside here i will go ahead and do
16:36 - um what do we say npm init and pm init
16:39 - to initialize
16:41 - our node.js application okay npm
16:44 - init okay okay
16:47 - and okay and then npm and then enter and
16:49 - then this will pretty much just ask you
16:51 - a little a few questions about your
16:52 - project right in terms of like your
16:54 - package name we're going to say
16:55 - node.json cloneless enter
16:57 - enter enter enter enter you know enter
17:00 - don't worry about this don't worry about
17:01 - this don't worry about this
17:04 - yes um justine i just asked the question
17:07 - what is the difference between
17:08 - react and node.js
17:11 - so yeah go ahead you actually you go
17:13 - ahead and explain that
17:15 - yeah so uh in in website we have the
17:18 - front end which
17:19 - uh which is the ui the interface we see
17:23 - and we have also the back end which we
17:25 - don't see
17:26 - and which handles all the routes and
17:29 - the databases so react
17:33 - we we uh use react for the front end but
17:37 - no js we use the for the back end that's
17:39 - the
17:40 - different so if you know react and no
17:44 - no js you are a full stack developer
17:47 - exactly guys
17:48 - exactly so node.js for back end react.js
17:50 - for front end
17:51 - and that's all you got but both are very
17:53 - important got that
17:54 - sweet sweet i love it i love it alright
17:57 - so let's keep going guys
17:58 - let's get to it so we've created our
18:00 - initial thing and usually what happens
18:02 - guys it's really once you pay attention
18:03 - to this you see this package.json file
18:05 - this is what happens when you create an
18:06 - npm init file correct
18:08 - npm init is files creates this
18:10 - package.json file which will kind of
18:12 - tell us
18:13 - you know what our project is about very
18:15 - important okay
18:16 - um no i'm gonna keep it here okay so
18:19 - after we created our npm manito
18:21 - file okay what do we what do we want
18:23 - what do we want to do um
18:25 - yusuf what's the next thing so
18:28 - we start with our server right now after
18:32 - uh we install we will need express.js
18:35 - so we will need to npm install express
18:38 - npm install express so express those npm
18:41 - installs but i'll explain that in a
18:42 - second what is npm install
18:44 - express express right here boom and pnsl
18:47 - express that is how we're going to build
18:48 - our api
18:49 - okay and that is basically exactly yes
18:52 - so mp on external express and you can
18:54 - see it actually really interesting it
18:55 - adds a dependency here
18:57 - express inside the package.json file
18:59 - okay so always always keep that in mind
19:02 - guys 885 people
19:05 - holy [ __ ] okay oh [ __ ] bro
19:09 - so guys make sure to smash that like
19:11 - button as you know make sure to smash
19:13 - that like button
19:13 - really appreciate that by the way for
19:15 - yusuf this is the first time on his live
19:17 - call so smash the like button for yusuf
19:19 - give him some fire in the comments guys
19:22 - you know
19:23 - he's an amazing person yeah he's amazing
19:25 - person on this clever programmer team
19:26 - it's insane all right and make sure to
19:29 - follow me on instagram for daily tips
19:31 - yes instagram yes exactly all right so
19:34 - we got that we fought we installed
19:35 - express and then from there on
19:37 - inside here server.js let's go ahead and
19:39 - initialize our express project
19:41 - so what i'm saying i'm gonna say const
19:42 - const express
19:45 - is equal to okay and then require
19:48 - require express correct yeah
19:52 - it's probably express express
19:55 - view boom right there it's require
19:57 - express i'm going to save that okay
19:58 - all good okay then inside here when i
20:01 - say create create an app i'm going to
20:02 - say const
20:03 - app equals express this is how we
20:05 - initialize our
20:06 - express application okay and so for you
20:08 - those of you who do not do not know what
20:10 - express
20:10 - is literally okay literally what
20:13 - expresses so if i go ahead and do
20:15 - express
20:16 - express nodejs you guys will see what
20:19 - i'm talking about express node.js
20:21 - you see accenture is a fast and on a
20:24 - payment it's a minimalist of a web firm
20:26 - framework for node.js
20:27 - so this is what allows us actually guys
20:29 - to build web applications that's insane
20:32 - it's to build web applications okay this
20:34 - is what we used express for
20:36 - it's it's kind of like you know it's
20:37 - like you know node.js and like express
20:40 - they go together like peanut butter and
20:42 - jelly does that make sense
20:43 - does that make sense yes it's like
20:46 - peanut butter and jelly okay
20:49 - all right sweet let's continue on let's
20:51 - continue on but
20:52 - by the way for those of you who did not
20:53 - see have you not seen the zoom clone
20:55 - check
20:56 - this out this is the zoom clone right
20:57 - here all right sweet so
20:59 - express we've created that go ahead
21:01 - yusuf
21:03 - uh i would suggest uh to close it
21:05 - because i think it's
21:06 - repeating your voice there the the zoom
21:09 - clone
21:09 - right there how about now is that better
21:12 - yeah i think so
21:13 - okay so that's the was the one okay
21:17 - so we have got we have got that this is
21:20 - all good what i wanted to go ahead and
21:22 - do now is we have inside constable
21:24 - express let's go ahead and create
21:25 - our server that's actually going to run
21:28 - right so i'm going to say so i'm going
21:30 - to say const server
21:32 - is equal to require and do it do we need
21:36 - to install http actually
21:39 - uh i think no it's a built-in built-in
21:42 - exactly that's built-in server and then
21:44 - we specify what app
21:45 - what app we want to use okay so now
21:47 - within this guys within this all we got
21:49 - to do pretty much at this point is
21:51 - simply listen on that server
21:52 - and actually run it so i will go ahead
21:54 - and do server dot listen
21:57 - okay that listen and i will say let's go
22:00 - ahead
22:00 - and the current port we're going to use
22:02 - let's say 30 30. okay
22:04 - so we're going to use a a 33 so this is
22:06 - basically
22:07 - saying that hey you know the server is
22:09 - going to be localhost
22:11 - okay it's going to be a localhost and
22:13 - the port is going to be 30
22:15 - 30. okay now what you guys are saying
22:17 - what you see is something that connects
22:19 - two peers
22:20 - exactly a beat nice job this is exactly
22:22 - what we're going to use
22:23 - so we're going to use webrtc for this
22:25 - specific task
22:27 - all right sweet sweet tweet holy bro
22:30 - a thousand viewers a thousand one
22:33 - game bro [ __ ] oh man

22:46 - said uh literally we have everything now
22:48 - ready and what i want to go ahead and do
22:50 - now is go ahead let's go ahead and
22:51 - create our first
22:52 - kind of url that we're going to hit okay
22:55 - so the first year
22:55 - we're going to hit is going to hit the
22:57 - slash url which is the root url okay
22:59 - makes sense so i'm going to say const
23:02 - and i'm going to say i'm going to say
23:03 - app
23:04 - dot get dot get
23:07 - and the app.get is saying hey what url
23:09 - are we going to hit this is where our
23:11 - application is going to live okay like
23:13 - on what
23:13 - you know url is it going to live on and
23:15 - it's going to live something on the root
23:16 - folder or root to icon which is simply
23:18 - slash
23:19 - and inside here i'm going to use the es6
23:22 - request response i'm going to say like
23:24 - this request
23:26 - response okay and i'm going to create a
23:28 - function this by the way is es6
23:30 - function function right just so you know
23:32 - and then inside here all
23:34 - i will say pretty much is i will do um
23:38 - response what shall we do we shall do
23:40 - response
23:42 - what should i say response.status that
23:45 - status
23:46 - right when i say 200 dot
23:50 - after status how do you how do we return
23:52 - the actual like um
23:53 - actual code do you know
23:56 - response.status 200.
24:00 - and we can make it say and then we can
24:02 - say and then we can return for example
24:03 - like hello world
24:05 - uh yeah uh right right
24:08 - i think down right exactly now right

28:22 - okay so inside here exactly yes this is
28:24 - an html file you can actually see it
28:25 - right here you know it's specified as an
28:27 - html file
28:28 - all right so inside ajs means uh
28:31 - embedded javascript so you can it will
28:34 - help
28:35 - uh it's embedded javascript inside html

28:38 - what what will allow us to do
28:41 - uh to pass variable in the html
28:45 - yes beautiful so we can pass in
28:46 - variables we can basically our node.js

28:49 - can talk with the front-end you know uh
28:51 - room.egs
28:52 - file okay so what i want to do at this
28:55 - point is i'm inside here i'm going to
28:56 - create html boilerplate okay
28:58 - and it's a really neat trick and i want
29:00 - you to listen to this really quickly
29:01 - here
29:02 - a really neat trick is they used to do
29:04 - exclamation point and just hit
29:06 - enter voila we have ourselves
29:09 - just like that we have a set of
29:10 - boilerplate for html that we need
29:13 - so i'll go ahead and say this is a zoom
29:15 - clone
29:16 - just like this boom save that
29:19 - and i will say yo
29:24 - let's build this let's
29:27 - build this sweet all right cool cool
29:29 - cool let's build this
29:32 - all right so we have that so now we need
29:34 - to do obviously is
29:35 - when we go ahead and go back to here you
29:37 - know we still nothing's gonna happen
29:38 - nothing's going to
29:39 - actually we're not going to actually get
29:40 - it will not actually take us to where
29:42 - we want to go so in order for us to get
29:44 - there in order for us to get there my
29:46 - friends what we literally need to do
29:48 - is the following so if i go back to
29:50 - server.js
29:51 - and inside here instead of the serv
29:52 - response the status that 200
29:54 - what do we need to do what do what do
29:56 - you need to do instead
30:01 - yusuf who knows huh so
30:04 - now i was just asking if they know do
30:07 - you guys know do you guys know but if
30:08 - you know
30:09 - yousef i'm asking you what do you think
30:12 - uh i think they they might no they might
30:15 - probably because ejs is
30:16 - new for some of them okay okay okay okay
30:19 - sweet
30:20 - so let's go ahead and inside here what i
30:23 - want you guys to do
30:24 - it's going to be like this so when i say
30:26 - response
30:27 - dial render render and the render is
30:30 - saying hey
30:31 - what view file are we going to enter and
30:33 - we're going to
30:34 - render the view file this simply just
30:36 - says room okay
30:38 - and then and then that's pretty much it
30:40 - that's all we're going to do that's all
30:41 - we're going to do just render this file
30:43 - so if i go ahead and actually
30:44 - save this okay if i save this if i go
30:47 - back to here
30:48 - oh nothing was specified look at that
30:51 - this is interesting right so we have an
30:52 - issue okay what's the issue okay
30:54 - in order for us to fix this issue what
30:56 - do we need to do uh yusuf
30:59 - so first of all uh we uh we didn't
31:02 - install egs
31:04 - okay to install ajs so npm
31:07 - install so let's go to quit out of noma
31:10 - real quickly
31:11 - and we will say npm install npm install
31:14 - and then what is egs for again just
31:16 - explain that really quickly
31:18 - it's an embedded embedded javascript
31:21 - uh uh embedded javascript
31:25 - so it will help us to get variables
31:28 - from the backend to the front exactly
31:31 - exactly and a lot of you guys are saying
31:32 - hey install ejs first
31:33 - yes you guys are smart smart cookies
31:36 - somebody said
31:37 - import room no no engine
31:40 - no engine yeah maybe i don't know about
31:42 - no engine thing
31:43 - that's interesting yeah so now
31:46 - yeah because now we need to set to tell
31:49 - the
31:50 - to tell express that to set the view
31:52 - engine
31:53 - aj yes exactly so we have installed you
31:56 - can see we installed ejs right
31:58 - we've done that and then all we need to
32:00 - do now is we obviously we need to go
32:02 - ahead do we need to import
32:03 - ejs or no we do not need to import ejs
32:06 - we don't right
32:07 - no we don't need yeah we don't instead
32:09 - what we need to do
32:10 - is we need to app into app.set app.set
32:13 - and i'm going to say hey the view engine
32:15 - for us is going to be so view
32:18 - engine for this is going to be what
32:22 - ejs exactly so let's go ahead and save
32:26 - this
32:26 - okay okay let's go back to and then
32:29 - let's go back to him we say nodemon
32:31 - just so this is a nodemonster.js let's

34:24 - sheila said install uuid create the
34:27 - ability to join
34:28 - beautiful so what we are going to do is
34:30 - we are going to go ahead and create a
34:32 - really interesting um a really
34:35 - interesting what's it called use a
34:37 - really cool library called uuid so check
34:40 - this out what i will go ahead and say
34:42 - is i will go ahead and create a new
34:43 - terminal
34:45 - okay i'll create a new terminal and i
34:47 - will say npm
34:48 - install and it's called uuid correct
34:51 - uuid
34:52 - yeah yeah right uid boom just like that
34:56 - and the reason why can you explain to
34:58 - them why we're using uid4
35:01 - okay so for uh you we need the unique
35:04 - id which is your id uiid will generate
35:08 - random ids so for every specific rule
35:12 - we we give a unique id so
35:16 - for example if i join uh if i go to the
35:19 - zoom clone
35:20 - i get a unique id for me and i want to
35:22 - invite my friend
35:23 - through this room but if somebody else
35:25 - create a new one he can join
35:27 - i just need the unique one exactly so
35:29 - this will allow us to create these
35:31 - unique ids for the rooms
35:32 - all right so we've installed a uid okay
35:35 - next thing we want to do is we need to
35:37 - import our uuid
35:38 - in our server.js okay so what we are
35:41 - going to do is we'll say
35:42 - const const and i'm gonna
35:46 - say um i'm gonna say actually i will
35:49 - i'll import a certain version of the uid
35:51 - which is gonna be v4 some say v4
35:53 - okay and i'm gonna say uuid v4
35:57 - just like this and i will say equals
35:59 - require
36:00 - require require okay and this is going
36:04 - to be required
36:05 - uuid okay so we're going to import that
36:08 - library okay
36:09 - we're going to import that library
36:12 - beautiful so we've got that next thing
36:14 - we want to do is
36:16 - our goal guys at this point is look we
36:18 - have you see this you see this
36:20 - um you see this link right here you see
36:22 - this link right here right
36:24 - and let me maybe i can i can yeah i
36:26 - don't want to use too many things but
36:29 - maybe show screen brush that's fine here
36:31 - see this link
36:32 - right there this link right here right
36:35 - this link guys
36:36 - is what we want to do instead of using
36:39 - this link we actually want to have like
36:40 - a
36:40 - room id be in this link okay
36:44 - so what we want to do uh in this case
36:46 - and actually to in order to actually
36:47 - have it like as a room id
36:49 - all right as a room id what we want to
36:52 - do
36:52 - on the option tab there we go as a room
36:56 - id
36:56 - what i want to do is i want to create a
36:58 - new a new
37:00 - um url right a new url
37:03 - exactly okay a new url so i will do app
37:07 - dot get oop okay
37:10 - i'm gonna say app.get inside here
37:12 - actually let's go ahead and
37:14 - get some more space here right there so
37:16 - i'm gonna say app
37:17 - app.get okay and inside here i'm going
37:21 - to say
37:22 - slash and i'm going to say room now
37:25 - here's why it's room the reason why it's
37:27 - room is because this is going to be a
37:29 - room this is a parameter think of it as
37:30 - just like a number right it's a
37:32 - parameter okay
37:33 - so i'm going to say room okay and then
37:35 - i'm going to say request
37:37 - our request comma response okay
37:40 - and i'm going to say boom oh okay this
37:43 - is where our request
37:44 - request response will be and inside here
37:46 - actually is where you want to go ahead
37:48 - and render this room so instead of
37:50 - rendering it here we want to render in
37:51 - here so i'm going to say response
37:53 - dot render room
37:57 - render uh like this room
38:00 - right there okay and then we're going to
38:03 - pass in some kind of parameter i'm going
38:04 - to say
38:05 - for right now it's going to be empty so
38:06 - i'm going to say room id
38:08 - right yousef room id yes room id exactly
38:11 - okay
38:11 - and then we're going to get a parameter
38:14 - a room id parameter
38:15 - so what is what is that room day
38:17 - parameter
38:18 - so it's going to be what it will be the
38:22 - request
38:26 - now how do we actually get that how do
38:28 - we actually get that
38:29 - with the way we get that is actually
38:31 - through here check this out so instead
38:32 - of rendering it on
38:34 - the the in the what's it called the root
38:37 - the root url i'm going to render it like
38:40 - this
38:40 - i'm going to say response dot redirect
38:44 - okay i'm going to redirect our root
38:46 - folder or root
38:48 - url and i'm going to say inside here i'm
38:51 - going to say here check this out
38:53 - check this out okay i'm going to say
38:56 - slash slash and
39:01 - boom oh wait wait wait wait wait slash
39:04 - slash boom boom boom
39:05 - boom this is by the way is called using
39:08 - string literals it's called using string
39:09 - literals
39:11 - e slash and this is going to be uuid
39:15 - v4 and that's a function okay so what's
39:18 - going on here yusuf
39:20 - explain to us what's going on here like
39:22 - what is going on in this video before
39:24 - yeah so so we know that the
39:27 - this route is the main route so when you
39:30 - go to local
39:31 - localhost 3030 so it automatically will
39:35 - generate a uuid for you and redirect it
39:38 - redirect you to it okay yes exactly
39:42 - exactly but
39:43 - exactly and app.get will get that
39:46 - you you id that you the uid function
39:50 - generated it
39:51 - and we notice that in the rest.render
39:55 - room we are passing room id
39:58 - to the front so that's where where egs
40:01 - comes from so we need to to create a
40:04 - cons
40:04 - and pass it to the front okay so here's
40:06 - what we're going to do when i
40:08 - since we've already done this okay we've
40:10 - done this and we have nodemon running
40:12 - right here this is nomad okay that's
40:13 - already all good no
40:14 - not a problem if we simply now go ahead
40:17 - i'm gonna i'm going to save this if we
40:18 - now
40:19 - refresh this page check out what's gonna
40:21 - look at this you see this
40:23 - check this out so literally you see this
40:24 - url right here as i'm highlighting it
40:26 - right that url my friends is a uuid so
40:29 - what happens is it literally
40:30 - redirected me to a url with your id
40:34 - which took it to here which then
40:37 - rendered
40:37 - the room perfect now what we can do
40:41 - is we can pass in this room id into our
40:44 - room.egs so i'm going to go ahead and
40:46 - save this i'm going to go to room.ejs
40:49 - and inside here i actually want to go
40:50 - ahead and i want to console log
40:52 - this room id so i will go ahead and
40:55 - inside here i'm going to create a script
40:56 - tag really quickly script check okay
40:58 - i'm going to say script okay
41:01 - script i close out this script right
41:03 - here ooh script
41:06 - okay just like this and i will console
41:08 - log i will console log
41:10 - console.log console.log um
41:14 - our room id which the way we're going to
41:16 - do console.log it is we're going to do
41:18 - like this i'm going to say here
41:19 - and then i'm going to use a temple then
41:21 - ejs templating
41:22 - which looks like this okay and now we'll
41:25 - specify
41:26 - room id okay and this is going to be
41:30 - just like that all right so console.log
41:34 - huh right there right there right there
41:38 - beautiful
41:38 - so so what we need to now need to see is
41:41 - when inside the log we need to see that
41:43 - room id
41:43 - i actually know it's like this is room
41:45 - id yes i see that's it
41:47 - so we've done this okay we've done this

41:50 - refresh this page boom if we inspect
41:54 - them and on this guys let's go and
41:55 - inspect elements on this

44:04 - ahead and create a new file called
44:06 - script okay script.js
44:10 - all right and we need to now at this
44:12 - point is actually import that script.js
44:15 - inside our html so i'm going to say

44:54 - sure that that's all good looks like
44:56 - we're getting our script.js which is
44:58 - actually just simply
44:59 - empty it's not a problem all right at
45:01 - this point what we need to do is we need
45:03 - to set the public url for our script
45:06 - file so if i will go ahead and go to
45:09 - server.js
45:10 - i'm going to say to the server hey
45:12 - server
45:13 - our public files are going to be here so
45:15 - i'm going to say app.use
45:18 - app.use
45:21 - use and i'll say express dot
45:24 - static okay
45:28 - public oh looks like we got
45:32 - uh yusuf calling you have you in the
45:35 - house
45:37 - yeah hey yours is back in the house guys
45:39 - give you serato plaza give us a thumbs

45:42 - with this
45:43 - sorry for the technical problems you
45:46 - always
45:46 - we always got tactical powers you know
45:48 - it happens it happens you know
45:50 - all right so i'm going to specify the
45:51 - static the static folder is going to be
45:53 - inside the public url which is here
45:55 - okay so i'm going to save that okay i'm
45:58 - going gonna save that
46:00 - and then i'm going to now go back to my
46:02 - html file and boom now our script file
46:05 - is
46:05 - in here right there and we are actually
46:07 - loading the script file now so you see
46:09 - the console
46:09 - that we do not have that error anymore
46:12 - okay
46:13 - so now basically inside the script file
46:15 - this is where all all our javascript for
46:17 - the front end
46:19 - is going to live does that make sense
46:21 - right that makes sense i think right
46:23 - this is where the javascript of the
46:24 - front end is going to live
46:27 - okay all right
46:30 - so what we want to do now is we want to
46:33 - go ahead and actually create a
46:35 - video element and actually show our
46:39 - own video inside the page
46:42 - okay so how do we do that yusef how do
46:44 - we do that
46:46 - don't wait so how about how about you go
46:48 - ahead and start typing a little bit
46:49 - right so like
46:50 - let's go ahead and you know show our own
46:53 - video
46:53 - inside the javascript file okay let's go
46:56 - ahead and do that
46:58 - just let me follow where are you right
47:00 - now because i missed the
47:02 - sometimes i'm currently in scriptage you
47:03 - want to go ahead and click the live
47:05 - share
47:05 - click live share and simply just follow
47:07 - me or i'll follow you go ahead
47:10 - okay so uh so now let's
47:14 - go to script.js yes so uh basically
47:18 - now uh so now what functionality we are
47:22 - going to create we are going to create a
47:23 - functionality where we are actually
47:25 - seeing
47:25 - our own video ah see
47:28 - so we want to request the
47:32 - to access the media i mean you access
47:34 - the video
47:35 - and the audio exactly so let's do that
47:37 - right now
47:39 - so the first thing we are going to do is
47:42 - uh let's first of all there's
47:46 - uh create navigator okay
47:50 - okay
47:53 - devices okay dot
47:56 - get user menu
47:59 - yeah and what this will do what this
48:01 - does guys for us because that gets us
48:03 - allows us the ability to actually get
48:04 - video and audio output from
48:06 - chrome so go ahead keep going exactly
48:09 - so the first thing we want to get is the
48:11 - video
48:13 - this one this uh so get user media will
48:15 - accept an
48:16 - object so the first attribute will be
48:19 - video
48:20 - so we specify if we want to get the
48:23 - video so we need to specify
48:25 - true so if for example if you you don't
48:28 - want to access the video
48:29 - we just type false but no we need video
48:33 - and need the audio type
48:36 - true so
48:41 - uh so now we have access but
48:44 - but this is uh as you can notice here
48:47 - get user
48:48 - media is will be a promise
48:51 - and who doesn't know i know some some of
48:54 - you know promise some doesn't but
48:56 - promise exists only in javascript so
48:59 - promise
48:59 - is an event in the future it will be
49:02 - either resolved or either rejected
49:06 - so take it it's it's in the like
49:09 - like a real promise i give promise to
49:11 - nas to call him
49:12 - so it will be resolved if i call him it
49:15 - will be rejected
49:16 - if i don't call him so beautiful
49:21 - go ahead so let's continue on by the way
49:23 - guys i just want to make sure i just
49:24 - want to
49:24 - give a thanks a shout out to we'll see
49:26 - we have a few people who just donated
49:28 - guys really appreciate that we have
49:30 - sanju thanks so much for the donations
49:32 - and then suman thanks much for the
49:33 - donation
49:34 - really appreciate that guys as we keep
49:37 - going really appreciate we have worked
49:38 - really hard on this and you know we love
49:40 - your energy on here and we just love you
49:43 - all on here so
49:44 - all right let's continue on okay
49:47 - so uh we want you to access to the
49:50 - promise when it succeeds when
49:52 - when the user accept to give access to
49:54 - the camera and the audio
49:55 - so we
50:07 - then we will uh create a function
50:11 - i use es6 function and you should always
50:14 - do es6 so uh
50:18 - this function will take an argument
50:20 - stream not create
50:22 - stream here okay
50:26 - open curly braces and
50:29 - so let's create outside the outside as a
50:32 - global variable
50:34 - a variable called my video stream
50:38 - my video stream so we because we want
50:42 - this
50:43 - variable to be global and access it not
50:45 - only in
50:46 - this uh curly braces my
50:49 - video uh my video
50:52 - stream and so on
50:55 - so now we created the variable now
50:59 - then we'll take the stream so this
51:01 - argument then
51:02 - my my video stream will receive this
51:04 - stream
51:05 - we assign it and my video three
51:09 - received the stream so this will be the
51:12 - result of the
51:14 - other videos it's just basically think
51:16 - of it it's just kind of like a video
51:17 - okay
51:18 - it's just kind of like a video and and
51:20 - so we're gonna save that video a stream
51:21 - that continues continuously keeps
51:23 - playing and when i say that you know
51:24 - inside so let's say stream so i'll keep
51:26 - going keep going i'm going to type here
51:27 - for a second really quickly here
51:28 - yusuf okay and then from that point on
51:30 - let's go ahead and create a function
51:32 - called add video stream okay
51:35 - i don't want to say called const okay
51:38 - i'm going to say add
51:39 - video stream video not video
51:43 - video stream okay video stream
51:46 - and inside this function we're going to
51:48 - type in a few things we're going to call
51:49 - we're going to take in
51:50 - a video some check this out i'm going to
51:52 - say
51:53 - like this boom that's a function we're
51:55 - going to take in a video object
51:57 - that's the video object on the element
52:00 - okay on the actual element
52:01 - okay and then we're going to take a
52:03 - stream okay
52:05 - and then with ex and then within that
52:07 - guys okay within this
52:08 - we're actually going to go ahead and
52:09 - play this stream so check this out
52:12 - so i'm going to say video dot
52:15 - source source object
52:18 - okay is equal to okay stream
52:22 - right now you said while i'm typing this
52:24 - stuff let's go ahead and uh
52:25 - enter some comments in the youtube all
52:27 - right just so like just so we we are on
52:29 - there as well
52:29 - so video that source object equals
52:31 - stream okay and then we're gonna say hey
52:33 - when we load all the data okay when we
52:36 - load all the data for
52:37 - this specific stream we're gonna do a
52:40 - we're going to play this video
52:42 - so i will say video dot add
52:45 - event your event listener
52:48 - just like this oh everybody
52:52 - i'm just going to copy my section just
52:54 - i'm going to start making this guys
52:56 - easier for us check this out so let's
52:58 - add event event listener on the load
53:00 - metadata and i'm going to say hey let's
53:02 - go and play
53:03 - this video okay and then what i will do
53:06 - is i will go ahead and later on i will
53:07 - append this video to a grid that i have
53:10 - so now nothing's going to show up just
53:12 - yet
53:13 - okay nothing's gonna show up just yet
53:15 - but what we are going to do is let's go
53:16 - and create a video element
53:18 - uh that we can actually play our video
53:20 - stream in
53:21 - because we have imported here but now we
53:24 - want to we want to actually create a
53:25 - video element
53:26 - so the way we are going to do this is
53:28 - the following
53:30 - i'm going to say hey let's go ahead and
53:32 - do const
53:33 - my video okay my video
53:37 - is equal to okay document
53:41 - dot create element we're going to create
53:44 - html
53:44 - element and it's going to be of type
53:46 - video element okay
53:48 - all right i'm going to save this and for
53:50 - the time b i'm actually going to my
53:52 - video i'm going to mute this video okay
53:53 - this is
53:53 - because this is my own video so i'm
53:55 - going to mute this so it doesn't kind of
53:56 - replay back to me so i'm going to say my
53:58 - video
53:59 - dot video dot muted is equal to
54:03 - true okay is equal to true
54:06 - okay and then what i want to do create
54:08 - so we can create our element which is
54:10 - cool okay
54:11 - but obviously now we want to add that
54:13 - element somewhere
54:14 - so the way we do that is now we remember
54:16 - how we called this functional add video
54:18 - stream
54:18 - so i'm going to call this function
54:19 - called edit video stream and i'm saying
54:21 - add
54:21 - video stream okay and then i'm going to
54:25 - pass it number one
54:26 - the my video right right you said my
54:28 - video which is this one
54:30 - my video about my video which is this
54:33 - element we have just created
54:35 - okay and then i will go ahead and say
54:37 - and we'll pass in the stream
54:38 - as well this is my own stream
54:41 - okay okay so that's all good we are on
54:45 - here but obviously if i save this guys
54:47 - what's gonna happen okay if i save this
54:49 - and i go back to here nothing's really
54:50 - gonna happen okay most important thing
54:52 - is you do not get an error which is
54:54 - i'm gonna get an error for that one
54:57 - because if there's no air that means
54:58 - it's good all right
54:59 - all right i'm gonna take off the glasses
55:00 - because this [ __ ] this this stuff is
55:02 - getting serious okay
55:04 - all right i'm gonna drink some water
55:05 - guys here for a second here
55:10 - all right beautiful so we've got that
55:14 - what i want to do now is
55:18 - is i want to create a html element where
55:21 - all of these
55:22 - videos are going to live let's go to
55:24 - room.ejs
55:25 - and inside this let's go we can just
55:26 - simply remove this and
55:28 - instead of this we're going to create
55:30 - something called a video
55:32 - grid so i'm going to say inside here i'm
55:34 - going to say div
55:36 - id is equal to video
55:39 - dash grid okay like this
55:42 - just like that okay and i'm going to
55:44 - close this out boom save this video grid
55:46 - that's so good now that's all
55:48 - great okay but you're great so inside
55:50 - this video great this is where we are
55:51 - going to add our
55:52 - video elements so let's go back to
55:54 - script.js
55:55 - and now instead of you know just simply
55:58 - playing the video
55:59 - the way we're going to do it is right we
56:00 - are going to add
56:02 - this video so i'm going to say document
56:05 - dot
56:06 - what the get i'll get element by id
56:09 - right diagonal id and what do we do
56:12 - there
56:12 - um yusuf exactly
56:16 - so we will retrieve the the video for
56:18 - right now
56:19 - okay exactly no we will put the video in
56:22 - there
56:23 - exactly we will put the video here
56:25 - exactly we will put the video
56:27 - but the way we're going to do this i'm
56:28 - actually going to get this video here so
56:29 - i'm going to say
56:30 - const video grid video
56:34 - grid video
56:37 - grid is equal to document
56:41 - oh dot get element by id
56:44 - and then i'm going to get the buy video
56:48 - dash good all right like this all right
56:51 - save that okay good and then i will go
56:54 - ahead and say inside
56:55 - for this video good i'm gonna say video
56:57 - grid
56:58 - dot what the append
57:01 - this video element hey
57:05 - look at this this video element okay
57:08 - so if we save this if we say that's
57:11 - interesting
57:12 - so if we go ahead and save this now
57:15 - let's go back to here
57:16 - let's refresh this uncod
57:19 - cannot read property append off no
57:22 - something's not right here
57:24 - we have video grade i say this right
57:25 - video grid
57:28 - document.getelement document that given
57:30 - by the video grid
57:32 - right video dash grid
57:36 - if i go to room.egs
57:40 - did i save this right here do you see
57:43 - any issue
57:44 - yusuf um i need
57:47 - um can you share uh your screen on skype
57:50 - so i can
57:51 - oh you don't see my skype you don't see
57:52 - my script that's true let's go like
57:54 - give me a second here guys
58:02 - so what do you think what else do you
58:03 - think is the reason why so we cannot
58:05 - read property append
58:06 - of no interesting interesting
58:09 - so video dash great
58:12 - huh which line which is this is
58:16 - inside script.js looks like we do get
58:18 - element by id
58:20 - video grid which is right here okay but
58:22 - when we go ahead and actually append to
58:24 - it looks like it's not
58:25 - actually doing anything for us so my
58:27 - curiosity is like
58:28 - what's actually going on you know video
58:31 - a video grid
58:33 - let's actually console log this ah we
58:36 - can figure this out guys check this out
58:37 - don't worry
58:38 - console that's just live session of
58:40 - debugging
58:41 - guys there we go all right let's see
58:44 - boom
58:46 - okay so it looks like it's snow so it
58:48 - doesn't see that video grid for
58:50 - some for some reason dinah specified div
58:53 - id right
58:55 - video dash grid
59:00 - copy oh actually i know why i know why
59:04 - this is going on
59:05 - i actually check this out guys so i'm
59:07 - gonna
59:09 - no no let's play this one no hold on
59:13 - all right so take this i'm gonna do this
59:15 - really quick this sound effect really
59:16 - quickly guys we're gonna solve it
59:17 - together here
59:18 - so the reason why it's really quickly
59:20 - it's not actually working is because of
59:21 - this
59:22 - because we are loading our our room our
59:26 - script.js
59:27 - way too early instead what we need to do
59:29 - is we need to go ahead and copy this
59:30 - script.js
59:31 - i'm going to put it right below the body
59:34 - right here
59:34 - boom okay right below the body true
59:37 - so now if we save this and we refresh
59:41 - this
59:42 - boom we have a video oh oh dang look at
59:44 - that
59:47 - guys all right all right all right
59:50 - we've got it though which is amazing all
59:52 - right sweet
59:54 - that is great this is great great stuff
59:55 - guys so i'm going to do it
59:57 - for this one we got it working
60:02 - let's go sweet sweet sweets wait wait
60:04 - wait wait
60:05 - all right so look we have a video which
60:08 - is working
60:09 - right it's there okay look at you it's
60:12 - just huge you can literally see me here
60:15 - and here
60:16 - guys which is insane guys drop in the
60:18 - comments below if you think this is

60:41 - we reach 1.5 k lakhs
60:44 - bro 1.5 k likes let's go
60:48 - heck yeah rory somebody asked why do we
60:51 - put the script.js in there we put the
60:53 - script.js in there because
60:54 - we want the whole document to load and
60:56 - that's only when we can do
60:58 - document.getelementbyid
61:00 - right so if we look at here the script
61:02 - that js loads after we see the html you
61:04 - see if we put it above this html
61:07 - then this line of document that get my
61:09 - id it doesn't actually see it
61:11 - okay because when you read the file it
61:13 - reads it chronologically
61:14 - all right insane people like yo it's
61:17 - insane great
61:19 - awesome yeah let's go insane bro
61:24 - man you guys are at but you guys are

61:27 - that part working all right let's kind
61:30 - of chill out here for a second okay

61:32 - all right so we got that part working
61:36 - next thing is what we've got this
61:38 - working all is good what is the next
61:40 - thing
61:40 - let's go and actually style that so this
61:42 - video great i actually want to make it a
61:44 - little bit smaller okay
61:45 - and you know let's just make that a
61:48 - little bit smaller
61:49 - now to make it a little smaller we're
61:50 - going to create a style.css file
61:53 - so i will go ahead and do it's like
61:55 - public let's go ahead and do for new
61:56 - file
61:57 - we'll say style dot css
62:00 - okay okay this is where our style will
62:03 - be
62:04 - let's go and import our style this as
62:06 - css which is going to be inside
62:08 - here so i'm going to say link boom and
62:11 - i'm going to say style.css just like
62:13 - this
62:13 - so save that okay and inside the
62:15 - style.css i'm going to say
62:17 - inside this.css i'm going to say hey for
62:19 - this video grid
62:23 - video dash grid
62:26 - there's video dash grid i'm going to do
62:28 - like this video that's great i'm going
62:29 - to sue
62:30 - i'm going to say um display flex
62:34 - i will uh i will explain this play
62:36 - effects here in a second guys
62:37 - display flex and i'm going to say
62:40 - justify content uh center for now which
62:43 - is fine
62:44 - just like i just cut the kind of center
62:46 - and then i will actually just
62:48 - that that's all will be okay and then
62:50 - for the actual video itself which is
62:52 - going to be inside the video grid i'm
62:53 - going to say
62:54 - video just like this okay
62:57 - and i will say height is equal to be 300
63:00 - pixels
63:00 - and then width is equal to 400 pixels
63:05 - okay yeah and that's pretty much it so
63:07 - we're going to save this i'm going to
63:08 - say this let's go back to room.ejs
63:10 - say that let's refresh this
63:14 - hey okay it's still big
63:17 - it's still humongous yeah we i think we
63:20 - need to
63:21 - we need to add the padding and some more
63:25 - attributes
63:26 - yes yes yes exactly exactly but the
63:28 - reason why so it actually is
63:30 - 400 by 300 pixels look at that if you
63:32 - look at this video
63:33 - it's actually 300 just it's huge why is
63:35 - this so huge
63:37 - boom 400 by 300 pixels is that really
63:41 - it high 300 with 400
63:44 - is this actually 400 pixels guys
63:48 - is it really all right i mean i guess oh
63:50 - am i just really zoomed in
63:52 - oh i'm zoomed in look
63:56 - oh my god that's a relief thank god
64:00 - that's a relief so video four so height
64:03 - is 400
64:04 - three no we're going to do like this i'm
64:06 - going to say let's go back to i will
64:07 - start the css i'm going to say
64:08 - highest 300 with 400 pixels and then i'm
64:11 - going to say object
64:12 - fit fit i will say cover
64:15 - to make sure that actually it fits
64:17 - within the within you know
64:19 - the actual thing right there beautiful
64:21 - so that my friends now
64:23 - is our first part of
64:27 - the grid which is insane we got our grid
64:29 - pretty much there

65:08 - we got that all right now with that
65:11 - being done this next thing we are going
65:14 - to do is
65:15 - let's go to our plan we want to we got
65:18 - this person done
65:19 - at the blue to allow others to stream
65:21 - their video now guys this is going to be
65:23 - a little bit tougher okay this is where
65:25 - actually we're going to get into the
65:26 - zoom stuff all right
65:27 - are you ready to get into the zoom stuff
65:28 - the actual ability to
65:30 - be able to interact with others and see
65:32 - their videos yeah drop that in the
65:34 - comments below and let's
65:36 - get it started
65:40 - insane insane all right
65:44 - so okay as i'm doing this actually uh
65:46 - yousef like
65:47 - you go ahead you go ahead and let's
65:49 - start this you go ahead and
65:51 - start this whole thing of um you know
65:53 - adding the ability to allow others to
65:55 - stream their video what are we going to
65:56 - do
65:57 - and you go ahead and start it really
65:58 - quickly here
66:00 - okay so uh we will introduce
66:04 - uh the first thing i think we will
66:06 - introduce
66:07 - peer.js okay
66:10 - let's do that well do we well let's not
66:12 - use no and not pds the first step we're
66:15 - going to choose is sockets guys
66:17 - okay yeah while i while i talk about
66:19 - sockets while i do socket stuff let's go
66:20 - ahead you will just explain really
66:22 - quickly here
66:22 - what is what are sockets what is socket
66:26 - so yeah yeah so so uh socket io is for
66:30 - uh uh saktayo is for real-time
66:33 - communication so if
66:34 - um me and us communicate together we
66:37 - will be in the same channel
66:39 - it's an it's used socket is a library
66:41 - but it use
66:42 - web sockets which are very famous for uh
66:46 - asynchronous uh real-time communication
66:49 - [Music]
66:50 - as you can see real-time engine so with
66:54 - web
66:54 - what's the different websocket is like
66:56 - an internet protocol but the difference
66:58 - is for example
67:00 - uh different what's the difference
67:01 - between sockets and http
67:04 - so for example with http you can only as
67:07 - a client
67:08 - make a request of the server but the
67:10 - server
67:11 - can only respond he cannot start the
67:13 - request to you
67:14 - but with yeah with socket io
67:18 - the server can communicate with you or
67:21 - you can
67:22 - communicate with them so uh
67:25 - with socket io the server doesn't have
67:27 - to wait for a request for you to
67:29 - uh to start uh a message or something
67:32 - that's
67:32 - why socktio is good for real time it's
67:35 - green
67:35 - it's it does create a channel only one
67:38 - channel
67:39 - it's like a tube so you the
67:42 - the messages and traffic uh
67:45 - go through that yes yes exactly exactly
67:48 - all right sweet so let's get let's
67:50 - continue on
67:51 - i'm going to go back into the code right
67:52 - you guys ready you guys i hope you are
67:54 - because i am so ready
67:56 - all right so the first things first is
67:58 - actually we need to install socket our
68:00 - socket i o in our project correct so
68:02 - let's go ahead and do
68:03 - that so i'm going to quit this but i do
68:07 - not need the server
68:08 - i'm going to do npm install and you hope
68:11 - you guys can see that npm install and
68:12 - i'm going to say
68:12 - is it sakida yo what is it what is it
68:14 - actually
68:16 - dot io so i'm going to say sake
68:19 - right no i didn't write that right suck
68:22 - it
68:23 - suck it hold on socket
68:26 - dot exactly all right stop
68:30 - suck at that yo sweet we got that that's
68:32 - so good that's so good
68:34 - all right so we got sakura installed
68:37 - next thing that we need to actually
68:38 - import that and so
68:40 - it's important right now really quickly
68:42 - so inside here we need to go back to
68:44 - server.js guys that's we're going to use
68:46 - it
68:46 - and we need to go ahead and actually
68:50 - do like this let's go here let's go here
68:53 - boom boom boom let's go make this
68:55 - smaller i'm going to say
68:57 - const io is equal to
69:01 - require okay require and it's going to
69:04 - be socket
69:06 - io okay and then we're going to specify
69:10 - the server i'm going to say server like
69:13 - this okay
69:14 - so this is our server that's how you
69:15 - that's how you import io and inside here
69:17 - inside the socket.yo
69:18 - we are going to create a connection so
69:20 - i'm going to say io
69:22 - dot connection oh wait no i o
69:26 - and then dot on okay on the
69:29 - on when basically when we are connected
69:30 - to when a user is connected to it or i
69:32 - am connected to it i'm saying connection
69:34 - okay basically when you visit the site
69:36 - on connection i'm going to pass in the
69:39 - socket
69:41 - like this and then let's create a
69:42 - function boom just like that okay
69:45 - and inside this socket io connection
69:48 - there's a there's a one thing one main
69:49 - thing that we're going to do
69:51 - which is you know when a user goes in
69:53 - there guys a user will go ahead and do
69:55 - something called they will join
69:57 - the room okay the user will go ahead and
70:00 - join
70:00 - the room and the way i'm gonna explain
70:03 - what that actually means really quickly
70:04 - here but just imagine you when you visit
70:06 - the site okay when you visit the site
70:08 - you will join the room right imagine the
70:11 - whole
70:11 - um zoom is a room so i'm going to say
70:15 - socket
70:17 - okay socket dot on
70:21 - join room okay
70:24 - and then join room comma okay
70:28 - and i will pass it i don't need to pass
70:29 - in anything just yet but i'm going to
70:31 - create
70:32 - you know an empty empty parameters i'm
70:33 - going to create a function okay
70:35 - and then inside this join room this is
70:38 - just going to be console.log
70:40 - console.log hey we have joined the room
70:43 - okay
70:44 - we have joined the room okay join the
70:47 - room
70:47 - just like this okay and so within this
70:49 - join room now what we need to do is
70:51 - actually the following
70:52 - we need to now emit this join room
70:55 - somehow
70:56 - okay we need to tell this bad this this
70:58 - this socket
70:59 - that we have joined the room and the way
71:01 - we're going to do this is we're actually
71:02 - going to do this inside
71:04 - inside um what's it called inside what's
71:07 - inside
71:08 - inside the script.js so if we go to
71:10 - script.js we also need to now
71:12 - import socket io in script.js
71:16 - correct yes exactly
71:19 - exactly exactly let me say fixed
71:22 - it looks like i think i think my audio
71:24 - is good my audio levels i think are fine
71:26 - i think yeah it's not nothing bad about
71:28 - my audio levels
71:29 - so we need to go ahead and now emit this
71:31 - socket
71:32 - first things first go to room.ejs okay
71:36 - and let's import our socket io socket io
71:40 - uh file which literally is just simply
71:42 - is like this i'm going to say script
71:45 - boom this is right here script sagadayo
71:47 - sagario.js okay
71:48 - we've done that exactly save that right
71:51 - at this
71:52 - point on oh looks like we have here he
71:54 - did
71:55 - give us 80. holy moly hey harry thanks

72:15 - yeah uh harry pressed make uh
72:19 - a donation thank you so much yeah yeah
72:22 - we just i just put that on
72:24 - but yes exactly exactly so with
72:27 - this point on we even put our socket at
72:29 - yo let's go back to
72:31 - let's go back to script.js
72:34 - and we will say when basically when we
72:36 - load this script we're gonna say hey
72:38 - i have joined the room okay so i will go
72:40 - ahead and say
72:42 - uh let's do socket dot
72:45 - what dot socket dot
72:50 - what is it yusef so here uh
72:54 - in script.js we will call the socket so
72:57 - socket dot um no no suck it up emit
73:01 - that we are joining the room yeah yeah
73:03 - exactly it's like that admit so
73:05 - it's like a joint room okay and then
73:08 - for now this is pretty much it that's
73:10 - all we're going to do we're just going
73:11 - to
73:11 - join this room okay join this room
73:15 - right there and now check this out i
73:17 - want you guys to pay attention to this
73:19 - so we're going to emit this join room
73:20 - and then on the server.js we're actually
73:22 - going to accept it
73:23 - you see this right here and we are going
73:25 - to say join room so i want you to pay
73:26 - attention to when we run this server
73:28 - what's going to happen
73:29 - so let's go ahead and run the server
73:30 - again so i'm saying no mon
73:32 - server.js okay oh so it's like can i
73:35 - find module socket io
73:38 - do i not uh what
73:41 - uh did you did you required it on the
73:44 - script
73:45 - i did require it here require a
73:47 - secondary all right
73:48 - no in the front uh indescribe.js no no
73:51 - this is sir that just my friend
73:54 - uh wait uh it's because i actually
73:57 - spelled it wrong so suckadayo
74:00 - my bad guys all right let's refresh this
74:03 - guys all right now it's all good my
74:05 - friends okay
74:07 - all right save that all is good there
74:10 - all right
74:10 - and what we need to expect guys what do
74:12 - you think is gonna happen now what's
74:13 - going to happen is we if we refresh this
74:15 - now
74:17 - okay we've omitted that okay we've
74:20 - admitted that and if we go to
74:21 - our join room uh nothing actually
74:24 - happened which is fine nothing actually
74:26 - happened we didn't actually emit any
74:28 - join room functionality if we let's go
74:30 - and the reason why is actually something
74:31 - broke looks like
74:32 - if we go to our console looks like
74:34 - socket is not
74:35 - defined at script.js and the thing is
74:38 - because we did not import socket io
74:41 - properly so if we go to our
74:45 - thing okay okay good script.js okay and
74:48 - then the
74:48 - top import we import it in the top so
74:52 - yes
74:53 - so we need to import it at the top so
74:55 - we're going to say
74:56 - boom const okay
75:00 - socket socket is equal to
75:03 - i o i o
75:07 - like this oh i owe that just like that
75:09 - okay
75:10 - i owe bo save that
75:13 - okay now but we what yeah but we we need
75:17 - also to import it
75:18 - in the room.egs using the script it's
75:21 - which we did so rumour gs which is this
75:23 - one right here you see
75:24 - no no we need to import uh
75:28 - yeah exactly yeah so we've done that
75:30 - right exactly exactly sweet
75:31 - alright so we've done that you guys
75:34 - think it will work
75:35 - i think i think it will work
75:39 - that's wrong sound i'll just press some
75:41 - weird sound
75:42 - a uncut reference error io is not
75:45 - defined
75:47 - it's not defined so it looks like we did
75:48 - not put it incorrectly i think
75:51 - would you know why
75:55 - uh okay
75:59 - yo just fine can't suck it okay do you
76:02 - guys think
76:03 - what's gonna what do you think why guys
76:04 - huh socket
76:06 - ayo let's go to our room.ejs we're
76:08 - importing sockets
76:18 - okay
76:20 - see socket io
76:27 - all right i think you do import hold on
76:29 - so import
76:30 - so socket io front end
76:34 - boom
76:37 - right there client script
76:41 - all right script source
76:46 - i'm gonna put that in here
76:49 - boom save that
76:53 - okay let's go ahead and refresh this hey
76:56 - look at that hey okay beautiful so the
76:58 - reason why is actually because of a
77:00 - deferred we had a deformed different
77:01 - here
77:02 - which is not necessary for this point
77:03 - okay right
77:05 - you guys said script should be at the
77:06 - bottom yes so we can actually yes so
77:08 - this
77:08 - socket io scribble actually should be at
77:10 - the top
77:11 - it should be at the top because we're
77:13 - using socket io inside
77:14 - script.js in here and you guys are
77:16 - actually really nicely
77:17 - nicely commenting on here holy moly lee
77:21 - is like yo check your file name
77:22 - you know we got script should be at the
77:24 - bottom
77:28 - you submit your audio if you can you
77:30 - submit your audio
77:33 - yeah oh man all right the nice nice nice
77:37 - nice nice the firm means it will be
77:39 - loaded last
77:40 - yeah so because of the because of
77:42 - actually behind the fern here
77:44 - this is also actually this is a great
77:45 - explanation so thanks so much
77:47 - alex or alex defer means it will be
77:49 - loaded
77:50 - last and we don't want do not want that
77:52 - okay
77:54 - all right so with this point on we're
77:57 - going to save
77:58 - this and now if we actually look at our
78:00 - here you see how it says join the room
78:01 - guys you see this is joined the room
78:03 - that means we have just joined the room
78:05 - we have just joined the room
78:06 - okay so sakurai is now working you see
78:09 - that yusuf
78:11 - saketyo is now working which is perfect
78:13 - with this point
78:14 - now let's go ahead and go to our
78:20 - server.js and we have joined the room
78:23 - now with this join room what do we need
78:25 - to do now
78:28 - yusuf okay so
78:31 - on our server when we join the room we
78:34 - we need to add the stream so
78:36 - we join to put the link now uh
78:40 - uh so circuit on join room now we need
78:42 - to join that room
78:44 - exactly so now i need to join that room
78:46 - but the question is what room are we
78:48 - actually going to join okay
78:49 - well this is where we need to get the
78:50 - room a room specific id
78:52 - okay remember actually when we render
78:54 - remember when we render this room right
78:56 - here guys
78:57 - remember this remember this room right
79:00 - we entered this one right
79:01 - and we passed this in and then inside
79:03 - room.ejs
79:04 - we had it where we had it in here so now
79:07 - instead of here i'm going to create a
79:09 - constant called
79:10 - room id and i will say hey const
79:13 - okay room room underscore
79:17 - actually i'm just going to copy this
79:18 - like this all right
79:20 - i'm going to start copying the guys so
79:21 - you guys just have a faster room id is
79:23 - equal to room id that's how we console
79:24 - like the before
79:25 - but we're going to initiate it into an
79:27 - actual variable
79:29 - very important okay very important
79:33 - so with this with this now in there we
79:36 - can now use this room id
79:37 - right this now is available for us
79:39 - inside script.js
79:42 - okay so when we do socket.emit join
79:45 - room okay join room okay we can now join
79:49 - the room with a specific
79:51 - room id so i will say comma and i will
79:54 - pass in
79:54 - the room id okay the room id
79:59 - okay which came initially from where
80:01 - from here
80:02 - makes sense guys does that make sense i
80:04 - hope it does right
80:06 - this is the joint room id we're going to
80:07 - join now so this point on let's go
80:10 - if we go back to our server.js right we
80:11 - have joined the room
80:13 - in here and i will say now i will go
80:16 - ahead and do
80:17 - now like this i will do socket
80:20 - check this out i will do socket
80:24 - socket dot what dot join
80:29 - join room id right but where's this
80:33 - coming from we need to actually pass
80:34 - this in this is a
80:35 - room id is coming from here so now we
80:38 - have joined
80:39 - the room okay we've joined the room
80:42 - so this is all good so we've now joined
80:44 - the room from the specific room id
80:46 - and now we need to do guys is now we
80:48 - actually need to tell you
80:49 - to tell you know our socket hey do we
80:52 - have a user connected
80:53 - we have someone else connected because
80:54 - for example when somebody joins the room
80:56 - we have to now tell them that
80:57 - hey we have a user connected so what i
81:00 - will do is i will do like this i will do
81:01 - socket
81:04 - i'm going to start copying this stuff so
81:05 - you guys can see it
81:09 - boom i do not need this right now just
81:11 - yet
81:12 - okay socket dot to room id the broadcast
81:16 - the broadcast user connected so what is
81:19 - this actually going to do
81:23 - what is this going to do broadcast
81:26 - it's okay the same like the name yes
81:29 - it's gonna broadcast this user connected
81:32 - think of it as like think about this
81:33 - guys think of this as like it's like
81:35 - it's like a phone call almost it's like
81:37 - hey you know for example somebody joined
81:38 - my room
81:39 - right and somebody joined my room and
81:41 - now i'm telling everybody else
81:42 - inside the room that this user has
81:44 - connected so they can add that user
81:46 - to their own to their own uh stream
81:50 - make sense yes it does
81:55 - you guys are asking hey can you watch
81:56 - this video later yes of course you can
81:58 - watch this video later guys that's not
82:00 - even a problem
82:01 - so user connected yeah that's all good
82:03 - and now we actually
82:05 - and now if we go back to script that yes
82:08 - we need to listen on the user connected
82:11 - just like so so i'm going to say socket
82:13 - on
82:16 - socket socket.on
82:20 - okay user user dash
82:23 - connected okay good name okay
82:27 - exactly and then for now i'm just gonna
82:30 - have
82:30 - empty parentheses because that's empty
82:32 - variables and then i'll go i'm going to
82:34 - say i'm using connected
82:36 - uh i'm actually going to create a
82:37 - function called
82:39 - connect to new user connect to
82:43 - new user now this function is not
82:45 - created just yet but i will
82:46 - so what i will create a new function now
82:48 - we'll say connect to new user actually
82:51 - i'm going to say contact
82:52 - user connect connect
82:55 - connect am i saying this right
82:58 - connecting user okay
83:00 - all right connect to the user hold on
83:02 - const connect to your user all right
83:04 - equals
83:15 - i want to say thanks for meeting raj for
83:18 - their
83:18 - donation oh there we go niraj
83:21 - right there hey appreciate it my friend
83:24 - thanks so much guys like i said always i
83:26 - always appreciate donations
83:28 - they feel so good guys always feel so
83:30 - good
83:31 - all right connect to new user now what's
83:34 - going to happen
83:35 - here okay what's going to happen here is
83:36 - a few things and i don't want to talk
83:38 - about it just yet
83:39 - but here's what's going to happen okay
83:41 - inside here this will actually we are
83:42 - going to send
83:43 - now that user like you know our own
83:45 - video stream but i'm not going to do it
83:47 - just yet i'm just going to say i'm i'm
83:48 - just going to console log of this and
83:50 - i'm going to say console log
83:51 - you know a new user uh new user
83:54 - console log new user okay so now
83:58 - what's going to happen user connected is
84:00 - going to connect to a new user
84:02 - which is this and it's going to console
84:04 - log new user
84:05 - now if i refresh this
84:09 - right i don't have this output right
84:11 - here right there's nothing
84:12 - nothing that says hey new user right but
84:15 - if i go ahead and i copy this link
84:17 - okay and a different user approaches me
84:22 - okay new user look at this guys
84:25 - this is insane now awesome i just want
84:27 - you guys to think about this here for a
84:28 - second okay i'm giving some applause
84:30 - this is insane if someone else connected
84:33 - someone else somebody else connected
84:35 - and now i on the front end saw that and
84:38 - this is why we say
84:39 - new user right inside here we emitted
84:42 - that and then everybody knows about this
84:44 - new user but the question now
84:45 - is actually how do we go ahead like how
84:47 - do we identify that user okay
84:49 - this is a good question the way we've
84:51 - identified
84:52 - now i want to say thanks for web dev
84:54 - simplified he just
84:56 - joined in the comments hey
84:59 - where's the simplified where is it
85:02 - it's a little bit yeah it's at the top
85:06 - yeah thanks so much thanks so much
85:09 - appreciate
85:10 - appreciate that simplify seriously guys
85:12 - check out what the simplified guys
85:13 - amazing amazing guy we learned a lot
85:14 - from him in terms of how we
85:16 - in terms of you know how we built the
85:17 - zoom clone amazing amazing guy
85:19 - thank you so much you know we just kind
85:21 - of took that we and we saw how
85:23 - how we can kind of add our own things to
85:25 - it and this is what we are here
85:27 - doing all right all right sweet so i
85:30 - appreciate it i appreciate my friend
85:31 - appreciate it all right so connect to
85:33 - new user which is which is really cool
85:36 - and now at this point what we want to do
85:39 - is is actually to identify that user
85:41 - specifically
85:42 - now in order to identify a user this is
85:44 - where we need to get sent to something
85:46 - called
85:46 - peer-to-peer okay um with peer-to-peer
85:50 - you know
85:50 - with with webrtc right we're going to
85:53 - use
85:54 - peerjs to now actually send the streams
85:56 - between different people
85:58 - all right so i want you to just pay
86:00 - attention here really quickly
86:02 - okay okay what is webrtc
86:06 - web rtc dc
86:10 - yes what about you see okay webrtc
86:13 - is uh no i don't like that that
86:16 - definition
86:18 - is a free and open source uh where is it
86:20 - where is it no no no no no no
86:22 - it's a free and open source project that
86:24 - provides web browsers
86:26 - and the multiplications with the
86:27 - real-time communication via simple
86:29 - application programming interface
86:30 - so it is what allows web browsers to
86:32 - kind of communicate that to together
86:34 - in real time all right and so webrtc now
86:38 - webrtc now which is here
86:42 - web uh i'm sorry pgs
86:46 - okay pjs which is here is what's going
86:49 - to use right looks like this is how pjs
86:51 - now
86:51 - wraps the browser's webrtc
86:54 - implementation to provide
86:56 - a complete and configurable easy
86:59 - use peer-to-peer connection okay and you
87:01 - can see the way we simply do is
87:03 - is we can literally have it you know we
87:04 - can immediately just import the library
87:06 - like this we create a new peer
87:08 - connection and then we can actually
87:09 - connect
87:10 - to other people receive calls and we can
87:13 - send for example video
87:14 - you know on audio and so forth so does
87:16 - that make sense
87:17 - drop in the comments below does that
87:18 - make sense right if it doesn't it's okay
87:21 - we can continue on we can continue on
87:24 - [Laughter]
87:26 - all right so with that continuing on
87:29 - let's go ahead
87:30 - and do this all right first things
87:34 - first that we really need to do is we
87:36 - actually need to install
87:38 - peer js we need to install pds on our
87:41 - server
87:42 - so let's go to server right and we need
87:45 - to go ahead and install
87:46 - pier all right so inside here i'm going
87:49 - to quit test out
87:50 - and i'm saying npm install is it just
87:53 - peer
87:53 - right peer right
87:57 - yousef no okay install peer
88:02 - beautiful peer guess okay
88:06 - all right and now we need to actually
88:07 - run that prgs server okay but the way
88:10 - we're going to do this is like this
88:11 - so we've installed peer okay inside
88:14 - our server.js here's what we are going
88:16 - to do inside here
88:18 - we're gonna we are going to say the
88:21 - following
88:22 - all right we're going to do the
88:24 - following i'm going to copy this really
88:25 - quickly and you guys can simply just
88:26 - watch this
88:27 - all right so check this out so in here
88:29 - we are we
88:30 - imported peer and then inside here
88:33 - then we we use something called express
88:36 - peer
88:37 - server right so basically now the peer
88:39 - server is actually working
88:40 - within together together with express to
88:43 - you know
88:43 - work together and give us this
88:44 - functionality all right
88:46 - and then what we're going to use is we
88:48 - will go ahead and specify to the peer
88:50 - server
88:51 - hey what url are you going to use and
88:53 - the url we're going to use is simply
88:54 - just
88:54 - this right app.use peerjs okay
88:57 - and this is the piercer that that is
88:59 - here all right so
89:01 - save this so our peer server is now live
89:03 - and all good and all we have to do now
89:05 - is simply run the server and we shall be
89:06 - fine
89:07 - so if i do no month server
89:10 - all right we should all be fine in this
89:12 - case still
89:14 - now if we go back to now the front end
89:15 - this is where our peer connections are
89:17 - going to be
89:18 - all right first things first that we
89:20 - need to do is
89:22 - is actually we need to listen on
89:25 - the opening of appear connection well
89:28 - actually no first me to import
89:30 - appear right so if we do peerjs you can
89:33 - see right here this is peer
89:35 - so include the library i'm going to copy
89:37 - this library
89:39 - i'm going to go back to my room.ejs
89:42 - and i'm going to paste this in right
89:44 - here paste it in right here
89:47 - i'm going to save this and that's all
89:49 - good now okay
89:50 - next up we need to create a new peer
89:52 - connection which is in here
89:54 - and so if we go now go to script.js
89:56 - script the gs and let's go ahead and
89:58 - create the new pair connection guys okay
89:59 - now with this there's going to be a few
90:01 - different things that we're going to do
90:03 - all right inside here we're going to
90:04 - specify the id which we don't
90:06 - we don't really need or the id is going
90:08 - to be created automatically
90:09 - by uh by peer so we don't we do not need
90:12 - one okay
90:13 - but in terms of options okay we're going
90:16 - to specify the following path i'm going
90:17 - to say it's path
90:20 - is going to be dash peer
90:23 - js okay and the way where from where we
90:25 - got that is back from the server.js
90:28 - in terms of the actual host the host is
90:31 - going to be whatever host that we're
90:32 - hosting is on so i'm gonna say host
90:34 - that's just gonna be slash so host
90:35 - basically whatever host we're hosting
90:37 - this on either localhost or you know
90:38 - heroku whatever maybe
90:40 - that's where it's gonna be next port
90:43 - port is gonna be
90:47 - four four three no throw 30 30 for now
90:49 - because we're on local host my friend
90:51 - yeah 30 30 all right and the reason why
90:53 - it's 30 30 because it's because
90:55 - our node.js server is on 30
90:58 - 30. hopefully that made sense all right
91:02 - so that my friends is all good okay now
91:05 - what we need to do is we need to listen
91:06 - on the peer connection okay so now
91:10 - we have peer which is here okay
91:14 - so now it's going to happen you remember
91:15 - how we did this join room check this out
91:17 - we're gonna wrap this i'm gonna say peer
91:19 - dot on okay
91:23 - dot on hey when i open this connection
91:27 - open this connection and i get a
91:29 - specific id an id is
91:31 - simply just think of it as like you have
91:32 - your own id okay you have your id
91:35 - id okay boom right there
91:38 - so this id is going to be passed in here
91:40 - actually let's go under console.log what
91:42 - is this id
91:43 - so you guys can see it really quickly
91:44 - here console.log that id let's go back
91:47 - to our zoom clone let's refresh that's
91:49 - i can remove this for now let's go back
91:51 - to our zoom clone
91:53 - this is the id see this id right here
91:54 - this my friend is the id
91:57 - it's a specific id for me for the person
91:59 - who's actually
92:00 - uh you know connecting right and now in
92:03 - this socket that i met
92:04 - right i'm gonna say hey this specific
92:07 - person
92:08 - actually has joined this room and i will
92:11 - pass in the id
92:12 - right so we've passed an id but
92:14 - obviously we need to now
92:16 - right we need to now listen to that id
92:19 - okay so what i will do at this point is
92:22 - go
92:22 - to server.js and inside this room id
92:26 - i'm going to say user id
92:29 - right this user id okay
92:33 - and now when i emit user connected i can
92:36 - tell everybody hey guys
92:38 - here is the user id here's the user that
92:41 - has been
92:42 - connected okay okay
92:45 - so user connected i'm going to say comma
92:49 - i'm going to say comma and inside this
92:52 - i'm going to say
92:52 - just simply user id i'm going to emit
92:56 - this for everybody else
92:57 - that's saying that hey certain user has
92:59 - just connected
93:01 - all right and now that we have that
93:03 - let's go back to our
93:05 - script.js all right and where we are
93:08 - listen to connect user connected we can
93:10 - now
93:11 - actually listen on the user id
93:14 - guys you see this this is interesting
93:17 - stuff
93:18 - interesting stuff uh hold on make sure
93:21 - let me make sure that
93:22 - this is that we're all good i'm gonna
93:24 - say user id
93:26 - user
93:29 - id user id okay
93:33 - again user id and i will pass in this
93:35 - user id into the
93:36 - here user id beautiful connected to new
93:39 - user
93:40 - and this is going to call connected to
93:41 - the user which is going to call this
93:43 - function and
93:43 - since we're passing the user id we
93:45 - obviously we need to use that user id
93:47 - and say user
93:48 - id just like this okay and
93:52 - boom now we're here so if i do console
93:54 - log now
93:55 - console log a user id
94:00 - okay user id okay check this out what's
94:03 - going to happen
94:04 - let's go ahead and go back to our pom
94:06 - pom pom
94:08 - all right
94:12 - so obviously we don't have anything
94:13 - console log just yet but if i but if
94:15 - someone else joins my room
94:19 - right look this is someone else's user
94:22 - id this user id guys
94:23 - came from this other user that is insane
94:28 - insane guys insane guys
94:32 - all right so we have got that this is
94:35 - all good
94:36 - so what what am i going to do now
94:39 - at this point now we're going to use
94:41 - peer connections we're going to use peer
94:43 - now to connect
94:44 - to to our user the way we're going to do
94:47 - this is now we're going to say here
94:48 - to this user id let's call that user id
94:51 - okay i'm going to call this the other
94:52 - user who connected i'm going to call him
94:54 - okay i'm going to say const actually i'm
94:57 - going to just copy this specific things
94:59 - i'm going to call that user
95:04 - boom hold on i'm going to copy and paste
95:05 - this here boom
95:07 - called that user so here's here's what
95:08 - we have we have peer
95:12 - peer which comes from here okay peer
95:15 - call the user id and then we'll also
95:18 - we'll call in the user id with a certain
95:20 - stream which is actually we should be
95:21 - importing this stream from here
95:23 - okay now where is the stream coming from
95:26 - check this out
95:27 - the stream is should be coming from is
95:28 - coming from here
95:30 - stream save that and it's actually
95:34 - coming from where
95:34 - it's becoming from
95:39 - in the promise right so what does that
95:42 - mean yusef
95:44 - so it's uh actually meaning that the
95:47 - problem
95:48 - when using.then we are receiving the
95:50 - user's videos
95:52 - which we call the stream and we're
95:54 - passing it
95:55 - to the socket uh do the suck so we are
95:58 - passing the stream of the user
96:00 - yeah what is that circuit.on and all of
96:02 - those code
96:03 - is inside.then yeah so so that what that
96:06 - means guys what that means that if we
96:07 - actually in the uh
96:08 - on the user connected we actually need
96:09 - to go ahead and remove this right here
96:12 - and put this inside this stream right
96:14 - because we need to listen here
96:16 - on my stream let's go ahead and wait for
96:18 - my stream and actually then send it to
96:20 - everybody else
96:21 - right so when someone else connected
96:24 - right we have someone else who connected
96:26 - i'm going to save this
96:27 - i'm going to connect to that new user i
96:29 - know it's a little confusing guys but
96:30 - trust me it will make sense in a second
96:32 - here
96:32 - then i'm going to call that user someone
96:35 - else's user for example yousef okay i'm
96:36 - going to call yusuf
96:38 - i'm going to send him my stream and i'm
96:40 - going to create a new video element
96:42 - okay for for him and i'm going to
96:46 - call on stream user video stream so this
96:49 - right here this
96:49 - stream when when i basically re
96:53 - receive some of the stream i'm going to
96:55 - add that video stream
96:58 - does that make sense exactly
97:02 - i know this is a little bit like it's a
97:04 - little bit like
97:05 - like um it's a little bit odd i will i
97:08 - will say that it's a little bit odd
97:10 - all right so yeah it's a little bit odd
97:12 - so just check
97:13 - check this out so i'm gonna say
97:14 - advocation obviously with this add video
97:16 - stream function we do not
97:18 - have that just yet okay
97:21 - but we are going to create it right
97:24 - now all right so what i will say now
97:30 - so this stream biscuit is usually just
97:31 - so you know this right here this stream
97:33 - is yusef's stream no actually no yeah
97:36 - that that is use of stream yes so i will
97:39 - go ahead and create a function called
97:40 - const
97:42 - add video stream okay
97:45 - and i'm going to use this function right
97:48 - here
97:49 - let me see where uh
97:53 - i'm going to actually copy this and so
97:55 - you guys can simply can simply
97:57 - you know use it later on
98:00 - boom boom function add video stream
98:04 - but i'm going to do it in use six way it
98:06 - comes to add video stream
98:08 - boom boom
98:11 - add video stream what's going to happen
98:12 - now this is going to add a video stream
98:15 - right it's gonna it's going to go ahead
98:17 - and add
98:18 - the stream itself is going to be have a
98:19 - source which is this the one that we're
98:22 - passing in
98:22 - then we're going to wait on a listener
98:24 - actually we already have this look we
98:25 - already have a video stream right here
98:26 - what am i saying
98:27 - my bad my hat we have this streamer here
98:30 - we're going to call admin stream which
98:32 - is simply going to call this function
98:33 - right here
98:35 - so if i save this if i save this
98:39 - okay if i save this
98:43 - okay let's make sure that we are all
98:44 - good if i save this right here
98:48 - all right and now when a new user
98:51 - connects
98:53 - let's see when a new user connects we
98:56 - should technically
98:58 - see their stream are you ready are you
99:00 - ready to see this
99:03 - let's do it okay let's do it technically
99:06 - we should see this now
99:07 - so let me just make sure that i'm all
99:09 - good that i'm not like you know
99:11 - i'm not completely misusing anything
99:13 - guys
99:16 - completely misusing things guys all
99:19 - right
99:20 - i'm going to save this boom this is fine
99:24 - boom that's fine okay
99:27 - okay i'm going to now command c
99:35 - okay and we have nothing here now the
99:37 - reason why i have nothing here
99:39 - is for the following reason we now need
99:41 - to answer the call
99:42 - so i have called look i went ahead and i
99:45 - called yusuf
99:47 - okay i have called yusuf okay
99:50 - but i now need to answer because yusuf
99:52 - is going to call me right
99:54 - so i need to answer this call as well
99:56 - all right
99:57 - so the way that's going to work is the
100:00 - following
100:01 - so i'm literally just going to going to
100:03 - copy this really quickly here let's go
100:08 - back to the top
100:09 - on the stream right here
100:13 - pier so peer on call
100:16 - i'm going to answer his call and i'm
100:19 - going to go ahead
100:20 - and add a video stream from
100:24 - yusuf okay i'm going to save this
100:27 - i'm going to save this let's go back to
100:30 - our coding here let's refresh this
100:34 - okay i'm going to save this boom boom
100:37 - boom hey
100:40 - oh hold on look at that hold up there's
100:43 - too many people
100:44 - two people uh wait
100:47 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait audio
100:50 - false
100:52 - hold on
100:57 - hey hold on hold on let's do this again
100:59 - one more time one more time guys
101:06 - look at this guys we got two people
101:09 - connected
101:10 - this is insane insane guys
101:14 - insane stuff guys like like i said
101:16 - here's what happened i know this is this
101:18 - is a really hard one kind of to
101:19 - understand guys but
101:21 - right the way this kind of works is like
101:22 - i said is we are
101:24 - connect to new user we're connected this
101:25 - to this new user right here okay
101:28 - and we are sending this new user our own
101:30 - stream
101:31 - okay we're sending this user here our
101:33 - own stream through here
101:34 - okay i don't know are we sending no
101:37 - we're calling the user through here
101:38 - we're calling the user
101:39 - okay and then basically when the user
101:41 - calls us
101:43 - we answer it and we add it to the video
101:46 - stream
101:48 - exactly does that make sense
101:51 - yes it it does yes it does sweet
101:54 - so at this point on guys how insane is
101:57 - this
101:58 - somebody asking mean somebody's asking
102:00 - um
102:02 - let me ask you let me see some questions
102:03 - guys some of you guys are asking how
102:05 - many people are connected at once
102:07 - um i don't know we'll we'll test this
102:08 - out how many people can be getting to
102:10 - that one
102:10 - i think unlimited right a lot of people
102:14 - i'm limited people can get them once
102:16 - that'll be interesting
102:18 - let's see who else is like hey thanks
102:22 - bobby appreciate it bobby
102:23 - appreciate my friend yes the github code
102:26 - will be shown to you guys we'll be
102:27 - showing you guys now we got look at we
102:29 - got the streaming
102:30 - guys there right yeah must you generate
102:34 - ids using
102:35 - peers so peer again guys uh generates
102:37 - ids automatically okay
102:39 - those ids i'd be generated automatically
102:41 - all right what you guys see right here
102:43 - if i
102:43 - if you go where is my peer you see this
102:45 - appear open
102:46 - right appear open this is where the ids
102:48 - get automatically generated this id
102:50 - is automatically generated by this
102:52 - specific peer object all right so
102:54 - hopefully that kind of makes sense some
102:55 - things
102:58 - user id is unique to each user exactly
103:00 - yes yeah yes yes
103:02 - hello what's up
103:06 - hey guys guys so also awesome to have
103:08 - you on here like i said
103:09 - we've done a small part of it now which
103:12 - is insane drop in the comments below if
103:13 - you're
103:14 - pumped as we are as we
103:17 - are yeah steve is like no it's not
103:19 - unlimited your

104:50 - work on
104:51 - is actually going to be what it's going
104:53 - to be the styling of this application
104:56 - am i right yousef are we going to style
104:58 - this now
104:59 - yeah yes let's style this application
105:03 - okay so this one's gonna be a little bit
105:05 - more tough for now
105:07 - oh my god this is gonna oh man all right
105:10 - all right let's let's go to
105:10 - room.room.edu yes all right
105:12 - so inside here okay we need to create a
105:15 - few things if you look at our you know
105:17 - previous application which is do you uh
105:20 - do you have a previous a previous app
105:21 - running
105:23 - let me look at look at the code let me
105:25 - look at the code here uh yeah
105:26 - yes you do yeah you do yeah you do yeah
105:29 - it's here send you a link
105:30 - yeah yeah you do it i got it i got i got
105:32 - it you said thank you i got it perfect
105:34 - so this is our previous app that we that
105:36 - we have right here guys okay
105:38 - all right so our goal is to get to this
105:40 - all right so a few things that are going
105:42 - on
105:43 - here what do we have we have a you know
105:44 - a row we have a row that looks you know
105:47 - like this okay we have two columns one
105:49 - column and then another column
105:51 - so let's just simply you know
105:54 - start out with the main with the with
105:56 - the main class i'm going to inside here
105:58 - i'm going to say here
105:59 - let's create div
106:02 - can you see him by the way why does it
106:04 - do like this i'm curious
106:05 - what is this orange thing that it just
106:07 - kind of shows
106:09 - all right uh i don't know i don't know
106:11 - why yeah
106:13 - where am i all right so inside here i'm
106:16 - going to say
106:16 - div class
106:20 - because i'm selecting it oh that's why
106:22 - i'm like what that's going on
106:23 - div classmate that's going to be where
106:24 - our main you know zoom clone lives okay
106:27 - div classmate
106:28 - okay we have inside this zoom we have
106:30 - the left section we have the right
106:32 - section guys okay
106:33 - so the left section here is we have div
106:37 - class main underscore underscore
106:41 - left okay okay that's gonna be for the
106:44 - left section
106:44 - then we're going to have the right
106:46 - section just like so
106:48 - oop so we'll say div class
106:52 - main underscore is called right right
106:56 - okay beautiful inside the left section
106:58 - we're going to create a div
107:00 - uh for the video grid so i'm gonna say
107:02 - div
107:03 - class main videos
107:11 - and then inside that this is where we're
107:12 - gonna piss put put in the video grid
107:14 - correct
107:17 - oh yeah so we have the main container
107:19 - that contains the left and the video
107:20 - main
107:21 - exactly exactly all right and now in the
107:24 - main
107:24 - right in the main right then we're going
107:26 - to have that's where
107:27 - that's where we're going to have the
107:29 - chat so in the main right we're going to
107:30 - have simply the chat
107:31 - so in the main right let's go ahead and
107:33 - do in the main right let's go ahead and
107:34 - do
107:35 - um i'm going to say div
107:40 - main header i think maybe div class
107:43 - okay main header
107:47 - yeah so we need to specify that's a chat
107:50 - okay
107:51 - and i'm going to say h6 there's gonna be
107:52 - chat okay
107:54 - okay all right so that's fine okay now
107:57 - within this guys you

110:57 - okay let's go back to our main left and
110:59 - main left is flex 0.8 main right is like
111:01 - 0.2 so i'm gonna say
111:03 - main underscore underscore left flex
111:08 - flex it's going to be 0.8
111:12 - and then main right
111:15 - right main right main underscore let's
111:18 - go right
111:18 - is going to be flex 0.2
111:23 - there we go flex right 0.2 right
111:26 - beautiful so that my friends is working
111:29 - okay save that
111:30 - refresh this and
111:33 - voila ear horn guys
111:36 - now guys i just want to kind of i just
111:38 - want to kind of take a look guys
111:40 - guys so i say thanks so much we have 2
111:43 - 000 likes which is insane almost a dozen
111:45 - likes guys let's take this to 2k
111:48 - it is almost there guys
111:51 - insane stuff inside stuff by the way
111:54 - thank you thank you so much
111:56 - guys insane stuff i appreciate you guys
111:58 - so much you guys are you guys are the
112:00 - best you guys are the best it's all i
112:01 - can say
112:02 - because it's the best all right
112:05 - with this what's now you guys know
112:08 - well i know so this let's look a look at
112:11 - now this main left section okay main
112:13 - left actually has what the main videos
112:15 - which is here
112:16 - and then controls so the controls are
112:18 - going to take up some space and the
112:20 - menus are going to take up some space as
112:21 - well
112:22 - right so the way we make that work is
112:25 - how you sift in order to make sure that
112:27 - the controls are at the bottom and the
112:28 - videos are at the top how do you make
112:29 - that work
112:31 - so you want to the the controllers in
112:34 - the bottom right
112:35 - yes what do we do now in this case i
112:38 - think uh
112:40 - we align it we are going to use
112:43 - flex all right flex we're going to use
112:46 - flex guys
112:49 - oh no flex flag flax is the answer to
112:51 - everything all right
112:53 - so for the main left okay i'm going to
112:56 - say
112:56 - the main left i'm going to say display
112:58 - flex display flex
113:01 - okay and then i'm going to say flex
113:03 - direction
113:05 - flex direction is equal to
113:08 - column okay so now we have my videos in
113:11 - here
113:12 - and my controls at the bottom okay but
113:14 - it's still not good okay because the
113:15 - main left right
113:16 - you need to make videos kind of main
113:17 - videos needs to be kind of needs to push
113:19 - down everything else
113:20 - right so for in order for that to work i
113:22 - will need to sim i need to simply say
113:24 - main videos
113:24 - hey flex grow
113:28 - one right so now main video is going to
113:31 - grow as much as it can
113:33 - main control is obviously hidden right
113:34 - now because ebay controls has nothing
113:36 - inside of it okay
113:37 - inside the main videos i'm going to
113:39 - specify here the background color for
113:40 - this one
113:41 - is going to be what black boom
113:44 - okay so we're getting somewhere it
113:45 - doesn't look good just yet but we're
113:47 - getting somewhere
113:48 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
113:49 - to center these two right videos right
113:51 - so you can see we have two videos these
113:53 - are imagine imagine
113:54 - these are two people and the guys drop
113:56 - in the comments below how do we go ahead
113:57 - and
113:57 - center them well the way we do that is
114:00 - simply
114:01 - we also simply use what you said what do
114:03 - we use
114:05 - justify content yes justify content so
114:08 - we're also going to use flex for this
114:10 - right because
114:11 - this specific one has has a video grid
114:14 - right which is video right here video
114:15 - right here
114:17 - so inside here i'm going to say for this
114:19 - main videos i'm going to say
114:21 - display flex as well okay
114:24 - i'm going to say justify content center
114:27 - boom
114:27 - and what for the vertical alignment what
114:29 - do we do
114:30 - what do we do all right align item
114:33 - center
114:34 - exactly so i'm going to say align items
114:38 - center there we go so now we have
114:40 - centered our grid which is better that's
114:42 - exactly what we need
114:43 - i'm literally going to go ahead and copy
114:44 - this specific thing the specific
114:46 - css and i'm going to go back to main
114:48 - videos and i will say here
114:50 - and say hey dot main i'm just going to
114:54 - scroll

129:54 - from bootstrap
129:56 - no i think we didn't
129:59 - i think we did i think we did because
130:01 - it's right now
130:02 - the actual font family is just apple
130:05 - apple system which is interesting
130:07 - okay it's apple system i like it i like
130:09 - it
130:10 - all right main thing now let's go ahead

131:06 - how do we have that happen you get
131:08 - anybody know drop in the comments below
131:10 - well the reason why is because of flex
131:12 - okay if you look at main controls right
131:14 - you have display block one
131:16 - then you have what display black two to
131:17 - select three instead of saying
131:19 - hey flex start is the direction or is
131:22 - the actual
131:23 - you know alignment i'm going to say

131:29 - justify content what space
131:33 - between look at that now we're getting
131:36 - some of our friends right

144:50 - see this input right here
144:51 - i do not like how it looks here all
144:54 - right
144:54 - the way i'm going to style this is is
144:56 - i'm going to say the following
144:58 - i'm going to say may i'm going to just
145:00 - go to copy this guys because i'm just
145:02 - because running out of time here main
145:04 - message container
145:05 - input i'm going to focus on the input
145:06 - and i'm going to say hey the fact scroll
145:08 - for this one is going to be one
145:09 - the background so the reason why i say
145:11 - flag scroll one is because i want this
145:13 - input to take up the full width correct
145:15 - the full width
145:17 - okay i'm going to say the border is none
145:19 - and i'm going to say the background
145:20 - color is transparent because right now

148:34 - drop in the comments below
148:35 - you guys ready to continue going
148:39 - yes let's do it all right let's get to
148:42 - it
148:42 - okay so um
148:46 - so so the first thing we want to do is
148:48 - we get the
148:49 - input value so okay so let's go to
148:53 - the script.js here
148:57 - and in the so so
149:00 - i want to get this input here so
149:05 - okay uh you you are you are sharing the
149:08 - vs code right that's always good oh it's
149:10 - good
149:11 - you can trust me so the first thing yeah
149:14 - i do bro okay so i won't get my message
149:18 - so i'm gonna create a
149:20 - variable called message and here i'm
149:22 - going to use jquery
149:24 - since uh uh uh uploaded it
149:27 - when he uh added jquery uh when he added
149:31 - bootstrap
149:31 - he already added um where we're
149:35 - in the link as you can see here by
149:37 - default when you use bootstrap you need
149:39 - to
149:40 - add jquery but in bootstrap 5 jquery is
149:44 - not supported anymore
149:46 - but so let's keep going so
149:50 - let's go and get the input of the
149:54 - file of the input so here
149:57 - and try console.log
150:00 - here and type message
150:04 - uh but we want to get this
150:08 - input message when the user type
150:11 - enter because we didn't add a button
150:14 - so so the first thing we uh we
150:18 - we need to do is we call html which is
150:21 - the main
150:22 - file here
150:25 - using jquery of course so you see the
150:28 - dollar sign it replaces
150:29 - this gquery like this so
150:33 - we use the dollar sign so here we are
150:36 - calling the html
150:38 - the the file the html file which is
150:42 - dot egs uh to listen
150:45 - if a key down pressed key down pressed
150:49 - and we call the function so
150:53 - we call a function e we use es6
150:58 - oy
151:03 - so if
151:07 - e dot so you said what you could do you
151:09 - can actually probably copy some of the
151:11 - code and just kind of explain it so copy
151:12 - some of the code like key down
151:14 - and they can explain it right because
151:16 - then they'll understand better yeah yeah
151:18 - okay so here we made a condition
151:22 - if e which is the event of typing
151:25 - the key keyboard so
151:28 - uh 13 is equal to the code of
151:32 - tapping the enter key key so for example
151:35 - every keyboard
151:36 - every key in your keyboard has a unique
151:39 - number
151:40 - so the enter has the key 30. and we
151:43 - we want that we don't want to send an
151:46 - empty text so we
151:47 - we want to check that uh the message
151:51 - here i tape let's replace this by
151:54 - text not message so we want to
151:58 - to check if the message the value in the
152:00 - input
152:01 - is not not empty not zero different of
152:04 - zero so it will be either one
152:06 - or one character or more so so
152:10 - so we when we press enter we send the
152:12 - message and here
152:14 - we are calling socket.emit so
152:17 - in socket we have socket.email and
152:19 - socket.on
152:20 - socket.emit will send and socket.on will
152:24 - receive
152:25 - so here we are sending from the front
152:27 - end
152:28 - a message as you can see so on event
152:31 - message
152:32 - we are sending the value of the input
152:34 - which is
152:35 - the the message that the user type and
152:38 - then
152:39 - after the user uh press enter we need to
152:43 - clear the input
152:44 - we don't want the message to stay there
152:46 - so
152:47 - we just want to send so yeah now let's
152:51 - for example go
152:52 - go to the front end and test it test if
152:54 - when nas press
152:55 - enter we should um we need to console
152:57 - log it before
152:58 - so yes i'm going to save it uh-huh go
153:02 - ahead
153:03 - console. no no console.log
153:08 - uh we need message on the
153:11 - text
153:14 - now if nas can go to the browser as i
153:18 - even
153:18 - go to the browser okay refresh
153:21 - okay okay type something and press enter
153:25 - and go to the console
153:30 - console okay
153:33 - so let's that's weird because
153:39 - message is not defined
153:42 - oh we we replaced it
153:45 - with html we say because we didn't
153:49 - use msg here there's no
153:52 - keyword mmc no i think it's like msg
153:57 - javascript 55 so 55 because you're here
154:02 - right here see right yeah exactly
154:06 - but you actually want you want to simply
154:07 - console.log here correct
154:10 - yeah exactly so that's refreshed so when
154:12 - i press the enter i want to console log
154:14 - the uh the input hey ready guys you
154:15 - ready guys
154:17 - hey let's go look at that
154:20 - uh see we we here we are not getting the
154:22 - value so now
154:23 - we we need to add dot val here
154:28 - so let's bug and uh dot
154:32 - value so because we are just getting the
154:35 - element so
154:36 - okay so let's go let's refresh this one
154:38 - more time guys
154:39 - all right refresh this boom look at that
154:47 - now we are getting the value
154:51 - now go yousef go you sorry
155:05 - we make sure that we get the message so
155:07 - let's go back to script.js so
155:10 - when i type it uh circuit dot emit
155:13 - message i want to send that message
155:14 - hollywood
155:15 - frank just gave us twenty dollars

155:27 - all right that's cool i love it then
155:29 - thanks frank
155:30 - thanks frankie uh so
155:34 - uh we need now to receive the the
155:36 - message that we sent when we hit
155:38 - enter to the server and the server will
155:41 - send it again to the front and we pop it
155:43 - up to the user
155:45 - so we go to the server the
155:48 - server.js yeah here
156:07 - yeah yeah i will keep going or wait for
156:09 - you oh okay oh
156:10 - okay i thought you you were saying okay
156:11 - anyways okay like i guess i'll continue

156:14 - all right no no no okay uh yeah i
156:17 - thought you
156:17 - you were saying no no continue on let's
156:20 - go keep going
156:21 - okay so uh we want when the and the
156:24 - connection
156:25 - uh when we uh when when we the user is
156:28 - connected we want to receive the message
156:31 - so uh
156:32 - here on io dot on connection here
156:36 - ender socket the two so
156:39 - we want to do socket socket
156:43 - so we still we the user is connected to
156:45 - the other so
156:46 - here's socket on so this one will listen
156:49 - for the message
156:50 - so if you when you press enter this one
156:52 - will receive it
156:54 - and it will receive the message which
156:56 - will be the
156:57 - uh argument for our function
157:00 - okay and we want to
157:04 - send that function uh send this message
157:07 - to the front again so to the same
157:10 - and uh be careful we want to send it to
157:12 - the same
157:13 - room not to every room so make sure that
157:16 - we send it to
157:17 - that room id and we emit
157:22 - a create message here so now we are
157:25 - sending it
157:26 - we emit with create message
157:30 - and we send the message here
157:34 - now we want to receive the message to
157:37 - the new
157:38 - user so we go to script.js
157:41 - here and we do
157:44 - and we do socket dot on where are you
157:48 - typing
157:48 - okay yeah here okay go
157:52 - rocket dot on create message
157:56 - we should make sure that it's the same
157:58 - here the same
158:00 - string here as here
158:04 - so let's type create message
158:08 - it will take an argument which will be
158:10 - message
158:12 - and it will be function so
158:15 - now we got the message back
158:18 - so for example uh for example if we
158:22 - cancel that uh
158:25 - no clg
158:29 - console.log message
158:33 - we should uh see but
158:36 - let's make make it specific to that one
158:39 - so
158:41 - this is coming from
158:44 - server
158:47 - nice okay so let's save that and save in
158:51 - server.js here and now it can go to the
158:55 - i will save scrolls too okay
158:58 - so let's go ahead and refresh this okay
159:01 - now see if i type something it's
159:03 - actually not it's not going to emit
159:04 - actually
159:05 - oh it is okay so this is coming from the
159:08 - server
159:08 - okay okay okay now uh
159:12 - we almost did the actually hold on guys
159:14 - holy [ __ ] did you guys just see that
159:16 - guys this is insane

159:20 - this is like uh like a dji one you know
159:25 - yeah i mean that's that's pretty cool
159:26 - guys we just we talked to the servers or
159:28 - talked to us
159:29 - same stuff yeah see
159:33 - so uh we we did the hard stuff here we
159:35 - made the connection now
159:36 - easy stuff so now we want to
159:39 - uh show the message in the chat okay
159:42 - right
159:44 - so uh i'm going to use here
159:48 - so he uh in the room.egs
159:51 - here you see that oh wait i'm not in the
159:55 - right one so in the room.ejs
159:59 - okay scroll down go down
160:02 - here you see that ul tag here
160:06 - we created so we want to append our
160:09 - messages
160:10 - here so we go to the
160:13 - uh script.js and
160:16 - and we remove this and so we
160:19 - we get the el ellen using jquery
160:24 - so ul and
160:27 - oh one third we want to append the
160:31 - message to it
160:32 - append and now we want to append
160:36 - the message uh but we want to add
160:39 - le tags which is the children of ul
160:42 - so we use template string open the tag
160:46 - ally close ally
160:49 - oh i'm gonna copy it
160:53 - paste it it will be better okay
160:57 - so as you can see here this is
161:00 - our code here so uh we will append to
161:04 - the ul
161:04 - cha and when every message comes we will
161:08 - add a tag called li which will have a
161:11 - class called message
161:13 - and then inside of it it will be have
161:16 - a user because uh user and
161:20 - uh in the bottom the message so now we
161:23 - appended it
161:24 - so for example if not uh let's save that
161:27 - and let's go to the
161:29 - so let's save that okay
161:33 - can you check it see it you guys ready
161:35 - to see this you guys see it drum roll

162:14 - it's weird because we received the
162:16 - message
162:18 - let's try i need to append the ally now
162:21 - to the message
162:26 - yeah we did that
162:30 - okay yes oh i think
162:33 - i think yeah yeah i think i understand
162:35 - yeah so
162:36 - so yeah it's because it should be
162:40 - instead the
162:40 - dot then they all should be instead
162:44 - inside the the prompts
162:49 - oh you know what i mean inside the what
162:51 - promise oh the user media promise yep
162:54 - yeah so we need to copy all of this
162:57 - [Music]
162:59 - control x and it should be
163:02 - not here so let me check the
163:05 - what is the progress where is the
163:07 - promise

165:07 - append li class
165:09 - message that's what we're going to

168:17 - if you're pumped for this drop in the
168:19 - comments below
168:20 - and we'll continue going yep
168:23 - okay so uh back to the browser browser
168:27 - yeah keep keep typing uh until the
168:30 - message reached a lot
168:32 - keep sending messages send the messages
168:34 - because
168:35 - when you keep typing you see that
168:41 - you see you see this behavior we don't
168:43 - want that behavior
168:44 - we want to scroll down only in this
168:47 - message
168:48 - so let me go to server
168:52 - uh not server let me go to vs code
168:55 - okay so
168:59 - yeah i will automatically scroll inside
169:02 - that div only
169:03 - not inside all the the
169:07 - the window so we
169:10 - we will create a function we will call
169:12 - the scroll
169:14 - uh scroll bottom okay let's do that
169:17 - right now
169:19 - okay uh we will we will call it an uh
169:23 - here until below this one
169:27 - so control p now let's jump and create
169:31 - this
169:31 - function so
169:35 - it will be const scroll bottom
169:40 - all right okay so
169:44 - i have already uh the function let's
169:47 - just
169:47 - explain it all right and
169:52 - here it is an extra bracket
169:56 - so you you see we have in the room js
170:00 - the main d for the chat which is main
170:03 - shot window
170:04 - so i want to get this steve and
170:08 - in this same time i want to scroll top
170:11 - and get the i assigned the that div
170:15 - to the variable d i can for example name
170:18 - it let
170:20 - v i always prefer that to be honest
170:24 - okay d dot scroll top
170:27 - and b which will take argument
170:31 - the scroll height so for example if you
170:33 - now try
170:35 - go to try it we will call the scroll
170:38 - function
170:38 - scroll to bottom function automatically
170:41 - whenever we
170:43 - uh hit a new message let's try that
170:47 - ready oh hold on
170:50 - come on let's try it through here let's
170:53 - refresh this
170:54 - ready guys so try it boom
170:58 - boom let's see you two bubba
171:04 - yeah but the reason why it's actually
171:06 - like that is actually because i need to
171:07 - set the overflow to scroll
171:09 - right so let's go ahead and set the
171:10 - overflow scroll so really quickly guys
171:12 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to set
171:14 - overflow scroll
171:15 - for this specific for this specific
171:17 - messages container
171:19 - so if we go to main chart yeah if we go
171:22 - to room.ejs we have the messages
171:24 - right or the main chat window i'm sorry
171:26 - if we go to
171:27 - style css and we go to main chat window
171:31 - right we say overflow y
171:35 - scroll or scroll down
171:38 - yeah yeah so i'm going to save that i'm
171:40 - going to refresh this really quickly

173:55 - paste into scripted gs and here it is
173:57 - now i'm going to explain what this new

174:03 - mute our video okay video very quickly
174:06 - here
174:07 - so it know of course me to now call this
174:10 - function when we call the mute
174:11 - button am i right dropped in the comment
174:13 - below so what i'm going to do is
174:16 - go to that you
174:19 - yes and inside this right here
174:22 - mute button i will create it on click
174:24 - function that's going to
174:26 - call the mute button so the unclick
174:28 - function is simply going to look like
174:29 - this
174:30 - boom exactly boom
174:38 - called the mute function right click on
174:40 - that button so now if i go back to our
174:42 - script.js then
174:44 - button here's what's going to happen
174:45 - guys we're going to get our current
174:47 - stream you see this my video stream
174:50 - we're going to get our current stream
174:52 - which is this one right here right
174:54 - this is the one we got just in general
174:56 - and
174:57 - and then we're going to get the audio
175:00 - tracks for that stream
175:01 - the first audio track is going to be my
175:02 - track and i'm going to get the current
175:04 - enabled
175:05 - version of that audio track and what
175:08 - happens
175:08 - if it's enabled i'm going to disable it
175:11 - you see this
175:12 - and if it's disabled i'm going to enable
175:15 - it right
175:16 - this is how this is the ap how the api
175:18 - allows us to do this
175:20 - so and then what's going to happen is
175:22 - we're going to set them
175:24 - unmute and mute button so what does this
175:26 - does check this out
175:27 - so if i i'm going to literally just
175:29 - going to copy and paste this pretty
175:31 - quickly
175:33 - okay really quickly here boom
175:37 - so when we when we want to go ahead and
175:40 - when we want to go ahead and unmute it
175:43 - right we want to go ahead and
175:44 - set the mute to false we want to kind of
175:46 - unmute it
175:48 - right there we want to now change the
175:50 - text to be on mute and we want to change
175:52 - the microphone to be
175:53 - microphone slash with the unmute class
175:56 - okay
175:57 - and then we do document the query
175:58 - selector to go ahead and
176:00 - you know uh to change the inner html of
176:03 - the main mute button
176:04 - right but again this main mute button is
176:07 - not going to work yet
176:08 - why is this not going to work drop it in
176:10 - the comments below why is it not going
176:12 - to work reason why is because when we
176:14 - try to
176:15 - change the inner html of this here it's
176:18 - not there so if we do command c
176:19 - main mute button if we go to room.ejs
176:23 - you can see that we only have you know
176:25 - this is main controls button
176:27 - so we need to do oh sorry my bad we need
176:30 - to add
176:31 - main mute button to here right
176:34 - same thing goes for yeah just the main
176:37 - button we need to add it to there so now
176:40 - if we go to script.js
176:41 - if we save this just like that
176:44 - okay if we save that you ready guys you
176:47 - ready
176:48 - to see if this works yes let's see
176:52 - refresh ready
176:56 - yeah let's go
177:00 - oh wait didn't work it did not work
177:05 - hold on dang it why did it not work so
177:07 - if i do console log if i do console
177:11 - enable of undefined
177:14 - and enable upon define so it looks like
177:16 - it does not see the enabled
177:18 - uh inside here
177:22 - video stream
177:25 - my video my video stream
177:29 - why isn't that working my video stream
177:31 - is here okay
177:33 - right we get the my video stream which
177:35 - is fine that's there which is fine
177:37 - my video stream
177:41 - that's fine stream
177:47 - my video stream equals stream
177:52 - we need to now simply check if it's
177:54 - enabled okay
177:55 - let's go ahead and do my video stream
177:57 - console log my video stream so i'm going
177:59 - to go ahead and
178:00 - on on click mute mute
178:04 - i'm going to console log this
178:08 - my video stream
178:15 - here's the video stream oh you know why
178:20 - here look because i disabled audio
178:24 - yeah that's why so it's like
178:27 - you're trying to get the audio tracks
178:29 - but your audio is disabled guys so
178:30 - that's why you see this
178:32 - but the reason why i disable the audio
178:33 - is because i simply you know because i
178:34 - have re i hear a reverb so if i do
178:36 - right there it's not even if if i do
178:39 - mute now
178:40 - hey look at that now it's muted guys you
178:42 - see that
178:46 - all right let's do it all right next up
178:48 - uh let's go ahead we need to change like
178:49 - that color
178:50 - so you can see when we do an unmute we
178:52 - have a special class for on mute
178:54 - so i can literally add that class if i
178:56 - go to style the css
178:58 - if i do dot unmute
179:01 - dot unmute the color for this specific
179:04 - unmute
179:04 - is just a red color okay and it's just
179:08 - simply like a red color looks like this
179:12 - all right so now if i save this if i re
179:14 - restart this
179:17 - okay so boom check this out

191:19 - peer
191:20 - in order for this actually not not

193:49 - again so
193:51 - for the server that listen guys we

live call is done all right other than that drumroll please and let's go let's get to it sweet so here's the first things first that i want to go ahead and you know i want to do uh let's go ahead and actually let's we're gonna you know create a new tab right okay new tab we got this right here beautiful i'm gonna push this here look at this amazing by the way uh uh chrome extension i love that chrome extension let's go ahead and go to our vs code so this is our viewers code right here guys really important this is where we will be coding okay what will you be coding but the way you have how's everybody in the comments all good yes you're applying okay beautiful beautiful beautiful so let's go ahead and this is me and yousef are actually using something called uh screen uh live share like views code live share so we can actually code together at the same time which is insane so we create a project called node.js zoom clone it's literally just a folder that we created and inside here we're going to simply create a new file we're going to call it what server.js server.js let's go ahead and do server.js okay server.js now one other thing i want to mention is yusuf uh let's go ahead and actually who i want to give a shout out to one amazing guy who gave us this inspiration actually we learned a lot from in terms of how to build a zoom clone like this who's that guy yusuf who is him do you know web dev simplify web dev simplified so what did simplify check guys check him out on youtube amazing guy we learned a lot from him and actually how to build this you know zoom clone he helped us out a lot so really appreciate that web dev simplified but today we're gonna take that what we learned and get it to even more to even more and more epic version of the zoom clone as you just saw all right guys 775 people live holy [ __ ] that's insane oh amazing bro amazing amazing indeed sweet new this is awesome coding snippets says i am so interested let's let's get to it so first thing let's go ahead and actually i need to name this not serve.js server.js very important okay server.js and let's go ahead and actually inside here what i really want to do is i want to kind of create a really kind of a really quick game plan okay so it's kind of a new file i want to say plan plan.md okay let's just create a new file when i create a game plan very quickly here so i'm going to say inside here i'm going to say i'm going to say um so i like to say plan of action i'm going to say plan of action because who does not like a plan of action am i right guys am i right drop in the comments below who likes a plan of action right we all love a planet actually important yeah that's so important guys all right so with that let's get to it so plan of action first things first that we want to do is what we're going to uh so is we we want to initialize our project right initialize our our node node.js project project amazing okay then we want to go ahead after initials our node.js project we want to go ahead and actually in estra initialize our first view right so initialize our first view okay initialize our first view okay so first view that's actually basically what you will see so you know what you will see on the front end that's the first thing we need to go ahead and initialize all right okay somebody asked somebody asked daniel asked hey can i still participate if i do not have any experience of course daniel yes you can yes you can of course you can participate this is for everybody to learn you can just kind of you know do your best and then you know learn that's that's what that's that's what it's all about all right initialize our first view okay after we initialize our first view you want to go ahead and actually add the ability ability to to uh kind of to view our our own at the ability to view our own video okay video but before we do that we actually need to go ahead and um create a room create a room so right so when we go ahead and inside here right this is this my friends is a room so this is the actual zoom clone this is a room and we are i need a in a room you can see you see this specific id right here this id right here is like as i kind of highlighted we need to create a way where it will actually go into a room when somebody joins it okay so we do a great create a room id right there just like that okay and uh yusuf you can just keep an eye on the comments and then let me know if there's like anybody who like gave a donation or anything like that or anything like super chat anything that'll be that'd be appreciated okay and then i will go ahead and i will just kind of i'll kind of pop it up just one thought uh someone asked if we can we will cover the deployment yes yes guys we're going to deploy this app which is just insane insane all right so add the ability to view our own video then we will go ahead and add the ability ability ability to um allow others to stream their video right right correct by yusuf correct correct yep all right all right and we will go ahead and add ability then we will after we have done that then we want to go ahead and add styling okay um then you want to go ahead and add the messages add the ability ability ability to do to create messages to create messages and then just you know simply add mute button mute button uh and then add um add stop video button all right does that does that make sense guys drop in the comments below if that makes sense if that's a good plan of action for you because i think it's a good plan of action all right definitely definitely definitely definitely it is all right all right all right somebody said is the video streaming by peertopeer hold on this is actually amazing is the video streaming by peertopeer yes it is by peertopeer actually and you will see you will know we're talking about later on okay uh so yes what api we're going to use uh you guys will figure it out we're going to do something called socket io we're going to use node.js we're going to use peerj yes and we are also going to use what else node.js socket io and then pure js that's pretty much it right yeah uh egs and uh also uuid library and uid um express server yes and express server so with that in mind what i will go ahead is inside the server let's go ahead and literally get this stuff get this stuff going okay oh i'm here so inside server.js guys you know first things first when you create a when you are creating a node.js application which who who dropped in the comments if you know what kind of node.js is very important okay if you know what node.js is drop it in the comments below um and yes we are using webrtc by the way yes we are using rtc yes okay hold on hold on by the way is everything okay with our our stream it looks like i think i think we're all good right our stream is still all good 870 people holy moly all right that's amazing bro that's amazing so first things first i'm going to do i'm going to right click and open an integrated terminal okay and then inside here i will go ahead and do um what do we say npm init and pm init to initialize our node.js application okay npm init okay okay and okay and then npm and then enter and then this will pretty much just ask you a little a few questions about your project right in terms of like your package name we're going to say node.json cloneless enter enter enter enter enter you know enter don't worry about this don't worry about this don't worry about this yes um justine i just asked the question what is the difference between react and node.js so yeah go ahead you actually you go ahead and explain that yeah so uh in in website we have the front end which uh which is the ui the interface we see and we have also the back end which we don't see and which handles all the routes and the databases so react we we uh use react for the front end but no js we use the for the back end that's the different so if you know react and no no js you are a full stack developer exactly guys exactly so node.js for back end react.js for front end and that's all you got but both are very important got that sweet sweet i love it i love it alright so let's keep going guys let's get to it so we've created our initial thing and usually what happens guys it's really once you pay attention to this you see this package.json file this is what happens when you create an npm init file correct npm init is files creates this package.json file which will kind of tell us you know what our project is about very important okay um no i'm gonna keep it here okay so after we created our npm manito file okay what do we what do we want what do we want to do um yusuf what's the next thing so we start with our server right now after uh we install we will need express.js so we will need to npm install express npm install express so express those npm installs but i'll explain that in a second what is npm install express express right here boom and pnsl express that is how we're going to build our api okay and that is basically exactly yes so mp on external express and you can see it actually really interesting it adds a dependency here express inside the package.json file okay so always always keep that in mind guys 885 people holy [ __ ] okay oh [ __ ] bro so guys make sure to smash that like button as you know make sure to smash that like button really appreciate that by the way for yusuf this is the first time on his live call so smash the like button for yusuf give him some fire in the comments guys you know he's an amazing person yeah he's amazing person on this clever programmer team it's insane all right and make sure to follow me on instagram for daily tips yes instagram yes exactly all right so we got that we fought we installed express and then from there on inside here server.js let's go ahead and initialize our express project so what i'm saying i'm gonna say const const express is equal to okay and then require require express correct yeah it's probably express express view boom right there it's require express i'm going to save that okay all good okay then inside here when i say create create an app i'm going to say const app equals express this is how we initialize our express application okay and so for you those of you who do not do not know what express is literally okay literally what expresses so if i go ahead and do express express nodejs you guys will see what i'm talking about express node.js you see accenture is a fast and on a payment it's a minimalist of a web firm framework for node.js so this is what allows us actually guys to build web applications that's insane it's to build web applications okay this is what we used express for it's it's kind of like you know it's like you know node.js and like express they go together like peanut butter and jelly does that make sense does that make sense yes it's like peanut butter and jelly okay all right sweet let's continue on let's continue on but by the way for those of you who did not see have you not seen the zoom clone check this out this is the zoom clone right here all right sweet so express we've created that go ahead yusuf uh i would suggest uh to close it because i think it's repeating your voice there the the zoom clone right there how about now is that better yeah i think so okay so that's the was the one okay so we have got we have got that this is all good what i wanted to go ahead and do now is we have inside constable express let's go ahead and create our server that's actually going to run right so i'm going to say so i'm going to say const server is equal to require and do it do we need to install http actually uh i think no it's a builtin builtin exactly that's builtin server and then we specify what app what app we want to use okay so now within this guys within this all we got to do pretty much at this point is simply listen on that server and actually run it so i will go ahead and do server dot listen okay that listen and i will say let's go ahead and the current port we're going to use let's say 30 30. okay so we're going to use a a 33 so this is basically saying that hey you know the server is going to be localhost okay it's going to be a localhost and the port is going to be 30 30. okay now what you guys are saying what you see is something that connects two peers exactly a beat nice job this is exactly what we're going to use so we're going to use webrtc for this specific task all right sweet sweet tweet holy bro a thousand viewers a thousand one game bro [ __ ] oh man a thousand viewers that's that's insane thank you without expecting let's keep going let's keep going guys all right well so with that with that said uh literally we have everything now ready and what i want to go ahead and do now is go ahead let's go ahead and create our first kind of url that we're going to hit okay so the first year we're going to hit is going to hit the slash url which is the root url okay makes sense so i'm going to say const and i'm going to say i'm going to say app dot get dot get and the app.get is saying hey what url are we going to hit this is where our application is going to live okay like on what you know url is it going to live on and it's going to live something on the root folder or root to icon which is simply slash and inside here i'm going to use the es6 request response i'm going to say like this request response okay and i'm going to create a function this by the way is es6 function function right just so you know and then inside here all i will say pretty much is i will do um response what shall we do we shall do response what should i say response.status that status right when i say 200 dot after status how do you how do we return the actual like um actual code do you know response.status 200. and we can make it say and then we can say and then we can return for example like hello world uh yeah uh right right i think down right exactly now right right there and we're gonna say hello world hello world right there hello world beautiful okay save this right here all is good status is 100 and all we need to do is now run this guys that's pretty much all we need to do by the way how many likes do we have how many likes do we have right now uh one 1.1 k 1.1 k insane insane guys so guys in order to run our server by the way who knows uh drop in the comments below who knows um how to go ahead and run a node.js server okay dropped in the comment below so if you didn't know but what we are going to use is we're going to use something called nodemod so what you want to do is you want to do npm install npm install okay nodemon nodemon and you want to do npm install dash g dash g node mod and why do we use g uh yusuf g to install it globally exactly to install global so we can basically use it anywhere now i have done this already so i already have no mod so i have to do i know i do not have to do this again guys but all i have to say that and at this point is literally i will do nodemon and i will say server dot js just like this and that's it no master.js and that is it now my literally my app is running are you ready to see the response are you ready to see the response go let's go here we have that so we have saved this okay let's go ahead and go to our response and i will literally say localhost localhost 3030. and are we on there are we on there replace it with send oh right send so inside the right it's actually sent my bad app.get and we have we do have server that listen that looks like that's all good boom save this again hey there we go check this out guys we have our hello world which is insane and it's crazy guys we have already just just like this we have created our first node js app now yes it is very simple but that's insane like how is right that's that's insane right yeah so that's very much insane yusef all right we are building it from scratch bro from scratch guys surp yo yo we broke a thousand what thousand viewers yo let's go let's go let's go oh man man somebody's like anira was like oh my god i'm working for me too i'm excited let's go so many people are excited i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it love it sweet uh you go ahead and actually maybe answer some comments if you have a answer go ahead and answer any comments you got you know in in chat if you can okay i'll keep answering comments so you can alright let's keep going so we got our hello world right all that all is pretty much it was good right we have that what's the next thing that we need to do yusuf since we have our hello world done uh now we try to set uh to start to set our rooms yes yes yes just to go to the specific room exactly we are going to specific group now we want to do is we want to we want to go ahead and create our first index.html file right and the way we're going to do this is actually we want to create a folder called views so i'm going to create a folder and this folder is going to be called views ready so i'm going to say new folder okay and i'm going to say new folder and i'm going to say views oh wait wait wait and then views just like this views okay so that's views so and inside views guys can you guess what's gonna be inside views drop in the comments below what do you think is gonna be what do you think is gonna be well check this out i'll go ahead and create a new file and this is going to be actually our room that dot uh ejs for now now signing by some of you might be asking what is room.ejs now room.ejs it is going to be a it's going to be an html file this is where our code will live okay so inside here exactly yes this is an html file you can actually see it right here you know it's specified as an html file all right so inside ajs means uh embedded javascript so you can it will help uh it's embedded javascript inside html yes so basically it will allow us to do what what will allow us to do uh to pass variable in the html yes beautiful so we can pass in variables we can basically our node.js server can talk with the frontend you know uh room.egs file okay so what i want to do at this point is i'm inside here i'm going to create html boilerplate okay and it's a really neat trick and i want you to listen to this really quickly here a really neat trick is they used to do exclamation point and just hit enter voila we have ourselves just like that we have a set of boilerplate for html that we need so i'll go ahead and say this is a zoom clone just like this boom save that and i will say yo let's build this let's build this sweet all right cool cool cool let's build this all right so we have that so now we need to do obviously is when we go ahead and go back to here you know we still nothing's gonna happen nothing's going to actually we're not going to actually get it will not actually take us to where we want to go so in order for us to get there in order for us to get there my friends what we literally need to do is the following so if i go back to server.js and inside here instead of the serv response the status that 200 what do we need to do what do what do you need to do instead yusuf who knows huh so now i was just asking if they know do you guys know do you guys know but if you know yousef i'm asking you what do you think uh i think they they might no they might probably because ejs is new for some of them okay okay okay okay sweet so let's go ahead and inside here what i want you guys to do it's going to be like this so when i say response dial render render and the render is saying hey what view file are we going to enter and we're going to render the view file this simply just says room okay and then and then that's pretty much it that's all we're going to do that's all we're going to do just render this file so if i go ahead and actually save this okay if i save this if i go back to here oh nothing was specified look at that this is interesting right so we have an issue okay what's the issue okay in order for us to fix this issue what do we need to do uh yusuf so first of all uh we uh we didn't install egs okay to install ajs so npm install so let's go to quit out of noma real quickly and we will say npm install npm install and then what is egs for again just explain that really quickly it's an embedded embedded javascript uh uh embedded javascript so it will help us to get variables from the backend to the front exactly exactly and a lot of you guys are saying hey install ejs first yes you guys are smart smart cookies somebody said import room no no engine no engine yeah maybe i don't know about no engine thing that's interesting yeah so now yeah because now we need to set to tell the to tell express that to set the view engine aj yes exactly so we have installed you can see we installed ejs right we've done that and then all we need to do now is we obviously we need to go ahead do we need to import ejs or no we do not need to import ejs we don't right no we don't need yeah we don't instead what we need to do is we need to app into app.set app.set and i'm going to say hey the view engine for us is going to be so view engine for this is going to be what ejs exactly so let's go ahead and save this okay okay let's go back to and then let's go back to him we say nodemon just so this is a nodemonster.js let's restart our server guys okay boom right there save that refresh that here is it bro guys check this out just like that we've installed and we have installed egs and now this is working just as it should right now we're actually using the view file from ejs does that make sense does that make sense yusuf of course of course it makes sense of course it makes sense by the way just really quickly guys if you want to you know you know we have a free master class for you guys if you want to learn you know how to become a developer right we have a free master class link in description if you want to check that out completely free for you guys no problem just go ahead and check that check that out click the link in the description and you know and that's it all right let's continue on guys we have so many people oh oh man some of you guys this is amazing he's amazing all right so with that with that said we have created this okay insane stuff okay what is the second thing that we're going to do all right if we go to our plan we initialize the project done boom oh good right applause for us on that one okay and this has our first view we've done that boom boom hey wait wait no no there we go that's the one next thing we need to do is we need to create a room id right create a room id guys how do we do that drop in the comments below okay how do we create a room i d guys all right do you guys know a specific id a specific id so what we want to do is let's go ahead go into server.js okay and let's see you see okay and what sheila said install uuid create the ability to join beautiful so what we are going to do is we are going to go ahead and create a really interesting um a really interesting what's it called use a really cool library called uuid so check this out what i will go ahead and say is i will go ahead and create a new terminal okay i'll create a new terminal and i will say npm install and it's called uuid correct uuid yeah yeah right uid boom just like that and the reason why can you explain to them why we're using uid4 okay so for uh you we need the unique id which is your id uiid will generate random ids so for every specific rule we we give a unique id so for example if i join uh if i go to the zoom clone i get a unique id for me and i want to invite my friend through this room but if somebody else create a new one he can join i just need the unique one exactly so this will allow us to create these unique ids for the rooms all right so we've installed a uid okay next thing we want to do is we need to import our uuid in our server.js okay so what we are going to do is we'll say const const and i'm gonna say um i'm gonna say actually i will i'll import a certain version of the uid which is gonna be v4 some say v4 okay and i'm gonna say uuid v4 just like this and i will say equals require require require okay and this is going to be required uuid okay so we're going to import that library okay we're going to import that library beautiful so we've got that next thing we want to do is our goal guys at this point is look we have you see this you see this um you see this link right here you see this link right here right and let me maybe i can i can yeah i don't want to use too many things but maybe show screen brush that's fine here see this link right there this link right here right this link guys is what we want to do instead of using this link we actually want to have like a room id be in this link okay so what we want to do uh in this case and actually to in order to actually have it like as a room id all right as a room id what we want to do on the option tab there we go as a room id what i want to do is i want to create a new a new um url right a new url exactly okay a new url so i will do app dot get oop okay i'm gonna say app.get inside here actually let's go ahead and get some more space here right there so i'm gonna say app app.get okay and inside here i'm going to say slash and i'm going to say room now here's why it's room the reason why it's room is because this is going to be a room this is a parameter think of it as just like a number right it's a parameter okay so i'm going to say room okay and then i'm going to say request our request comma response okay and i'm going to say boom oh okay this is where our request request response will be and inside here actually is where you want to go ahead and render this room so instead of rendering it here we want to render in here so i'm going to say response dot render room render uh like this room right there okay and then we're going to pass in some kind of parameter i'm going to say for right now it's going to be empty so i'm going to say room id right yousef room id yes room id exactly okay and then we're going to get a parameter a room id parameter so what is what is that room day parameter so it's going to be what it will be the request now how do we actually get that how do we actually get that with the way we get that is actually through here check this out so instead of rendering it on the the in the what's it called the root the root url i'm going to render it like this i'm going to say response dot redirect okay i'm going to redirect our root folder or root url and i'm going to say inside here i'm going to say here check this out check this out okay i'm going to say slash slash and boom oh wait wait wait wait wait slash slash boom boom boom boom this is by the way is called using string literals it's called using string literals e slash and this is going to be uuid v4 and that's a function okay so what's going on here yusuf explain to us what's going on here like what is going on in this video before yeah so so we know that the this route is the main route so when you go to local localhost 3030 so it automatically will generate a uuid for you and redirect it redirect you to it okay yes exactly exactly but exactly and app.get will get that you you id that you the uid function generated it and we notice that in the rest.render room we are passing room id to the front so that's where where egs comes from so we need to to create a cons and pass it to the front okay so here's what we're going to do when i since we've already done this okay we've done this and we have nodemon running right here this is nomad okay that's already all good no not a problem if we simply now go ahead i'm gonna i'm going to save this if we now refresh this page check out what's gonna look at this you see this check this out so literally you see this url right here as i'm highlighting it right that url my friends is a uuid so what happens is it literally redirected me to a url with your id which took it to here which then rendered the room perfect now what we can do is we can pass in this room id into our room.egs so i'm going to go ahead and save this i'm going to go to room.ejs and inside here i actually want to go ahead and i want to console log this room id so i will go ahead and inside here i'm going to create a script tag really quickly script check okay i'm going to say script okay script i close out this script right here ooh script okay just like this and i will console log i will console log console.log console.log um our room id which the way we're going to do console.log it is we're going to do like this i'm going to say here and then i'm going to use a temple then ejs templating which looks like this okay and now we'll specify room id okay and this is going to be just like that all right so console.log huh right there right there right there beautiful so so what we need to now need to see is when inside the log we need to see that room id i actually know it's like this is room id yes i see that's it so we've done this okay we've done this let's go ahead and refresh this page boom if we inspect them and on this guys let's go and inspect elements on this let's go to console.log and look at this we have our room id exactly how we need it look at this see this room id boom this right here is the room id we've just passed it in from our node js server which is insane insane insane okay insane guys some of you like this is where egs comes in yes this is where ejs comes in by the way we have a thousand and one hundred what likes hum a thousand 100 what views a thousand almost 200 views guys in saying guys thank you guys so much guys make sure to hit that thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up button we will really appreciate that okay we really appreciate that so we've done that that's all finished now okay what is the next day that we want to do use of you oh you said can you hear me oh yousef looks like yusuf is pause here for a second but it's okay we'll just keep going not a problem at all not a problem at all all right so what i'm going to do at this point at this point you said when you can get on that's not a problem just you know try to get on as you know as fast as you can we've done this next thing guys we need to do is look we have created our room id which is that's completely done here boom done not a problem all good okay that's all good now so the next thing to do is add the ability to view our own video okay we want to view our own video so the way we will do that is if we go is now we need to create actually a um a script file okay so we need to view our own video in the ejs file so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and create a public oh looks like looks like yusuf is gone which is fine just fine boom all right it's fine so what i'm going to do now guys is i'm going to go ahead and create a new folder and this new folder is going to be public folder okay just like this public folder and within this within this i will go ahead and create a new file called script okay script.js all right and we need to now at this point is actually import that script.js inside our html so i'm going to say script let me say script boom script source and i will say script rip dot js okay now when we save this so when we say this go ahead and save this okay save this and let's go back to our refresh you can see this oh i split the token at script.js1 if we go to here wow looks like that's all good that's fine script.js script.js room.egs seems like that's all good that's not a problem refresh this one more time that is fine let's go to network to make sure that that's all good looks like we're getting our script.js which is actually just simply empty it's not a problem all right at this point what we need to do is we need to set the public url for our script file so if i will go ahead and go to server.js i'm going to say to the server hey server our public files are going to be here so i'm going to say app.use app.use use and i'll say express dot static okay public oh looks like we got uh yusuf calling you have you in the house yeah hey yours is back in the house guys give you serato plaza give us a thumbs up button and we'll continue on going with this sorry for the technical problems you always we always got tactical powers you know it happens it happens you know all right so i'm going to specify the static the static folder is going to be inside the public url which is here okay so i'm going to save that okay i'm going gonna save that and then i'm going to now go back to my html file and boom now our script file is in here right there and we are actually loading the script file now so you see the console that we do not have that error anymore okay so now basically inside the script file this is where all all our javascript for the front end is going to live does that make sense right that makes sense i think right this is where the javascript of the front end is going to live okay all right so what we want to do now is we want to go ahead and actually create a video element and actually show our own video inside the page okay so how do we do that yusef how do we do that don't wait so how about how about you go ahead and start typing a little bit right so like let's go ahead and you know show our own video inside the javascript file okay let's go ahead and do that just let me follow where are you right now because i missed the sometimes i'm currently in scriptage you want to go ahead and click the live share click live share and simply just follow me or i'll follow you go ahead okay so uh so now let's go to script.js yes so uh basically now uh so now what functionality we are going to create we are going to create a functionality where we are actually seeing our own video ah see so we want to request the to access the media i mean you access the video and the audio exactly so let's do that right now so the first thing we are going to do is uh let's first of all there's uh create navigator okay okay devices okay dot get user menu yeah and what this will do what this does guys for us because that gets us allows us the ability to actually get video and audio output from chrome so go ahead keep going exactly so the first thing we want to get is the video this one this uh so get user media will accept an object so the first attribute will be video so we specify if we want to get the video so we need to specify true so if for example if you you don't want to access the video we just type false but no we need video and need the audio type true so uh so now we have access but but this is uh as you can notice here get user media is will be a promise and who doesn't know i know some some of you know promise some doesn't but promise exists only in javascript so promise is an event in the future it will be either resolved or either rejected so take it it's it's in the like like a real promise i give promise to nas to call him so it will be resolved if i call him it will be rejected if i don't call him so beautiful go ahead so let's continue on by the way guys i just want to make sure i just want to give a thanks a shout out to we'll see we have a few people who just donated guys really appreciate that we have sanju thanks so much for the donations and then suman thanks much for the donation really appreciate that guys as we keep going really appreciate we have worked really hard on this and you know we love your energy on here and we just love you all on here so all right let's continue on okay so uh we want you to access to the promise when it succeeds when when the user accept to give access to the camera and the audio so we then we will uh create a function i use es6 function and you should always do es6 so uh this function will take an argument stream not create stream here okay open curly braces and so let's create outside the outside as a global variable a variable called my video stream my video stream so we because we want this variable to be global and access it not only in this uh curly braces my video uh my video stream and so on so now we created the variable now then we'll take the stream so this argument then my my video stream will receive this stream we assign it and my video three received the stream so this will be the result of the other videos it's just basically think of it it's just kind of like a video okay it's just kind of like a video and and so we're gonna save that video a stream that continues continuously keeps playing and when i say that you know inside so let's say stream so i'll keep going keep going i'm going to type here for a second really quickly here yusuf okay and then from that point on let's go ahead and create a function called add video stream okay i don't want to say called const okay i'm going to say add video stream video not video video stream okay video stream and inside this function we're going to type in a few things we're going to call we're going to take in a video some check this out i'm going to say like this boom that's a function we're going to take in a video object that's the video object on the element okay on the actual element okay and then we're going to take a stream okay and then with ex and then within that guys okay within this we're actually going to go ahead and play this stream so check this out so i'm going to say video dot source source object okay is equal to okay stream right now you said while i'm typing this stuff let's go ahead and uh enter some comments in the youtube all right just so like just so we we are on there as well so video that source object equals stream okay and then we're gonna say hey when we load all the data okay when we load all the data for this specific stream we're gonna do a we're going to play this video so i will say video dot add event your event listener just like this oh everybody i'm just going to copy my section just i'm going to start making this guys easier for us check this out so let's add event event listener on the load metadata and i'm going to say hey let's go and play this video okay and then what i will do is i will go ahead and later on i will append this video to a grid that i have so now nothing's going to show up just yet okay nothing's gonna show up just yet but what we are going to do is let's go and create a video element uh that we can actually play our video stream in because we have imported here but now we want to we want to actually create a video element so the way we are going to do this is the following i'm going to say hey let's go ahead and do const my video okay my video is equal to okay document dot create element we're going to create html element and it's going to be of type video element okay all right i'm going to save this and for the time b i'm actually going to my video i'm going to mute this video okay this is because this is my own video so i'm going to mute this so it doesn't kind of replay back to me so i'm going to say my video dot video dot muted is equal to true okay is equal to true okay and then what i want to do create so we can create our element which is cool okay but obviously now we want to add that element somewhere so the way we do that is now we remember how we called this functional add video stream so i'm going to call this function called edit video stream and i'm saying add video stream okay and then i'm going to pass it number one the my video right right you said my video which is this one my video about my video which is this element we have just created okay and then i will go ahead and say and we'll pass in the stream as well this is my own stream okay okay so that's all good we are on here but obviously if i save this guys what's gonna happen okay if i save this and i go back to here nothing's really gonna happen okay most important thing is you do not get an error which is i'm gonna get an error for that one because if there's no air that means it's good all right all right i'm gonna take off the glasses because this [ __ ] this this stuff is getting serious okay all right i'm gonna drink some water guys here for a second here all right beautiful so we've got that what i want to do now is is i want to create a html element where all of these videos are going to live let's go to room.ejs and inside this let's go we can just simply remove this and instead of this we're going to create something called a video grid so i'm going to say inside here i'm going to say div id is equal to video dash grid okay like this just like that okay and i'm going to close this out boom save this video grid that's so good now that's all great okay but you're great so inside this video great this is where we are going to add our video elements so let's go back to script.js and now instead of you know just simply playing the video the way we're going to do it is right we are going to add this video so i'm going to say document dot what the get i'll get element by id right diagonal id and what do we do there um yusuf exactly so we will retrieve the the video for right now okay exactly no we will put the video in there exactly we will put the video here exactly we will put the video but the way we're going to do this i'm actually going to get this video here so i'm going to say const video grid video grid video grid is equal to document oh dot get element by id and then i'm going to get the buy video dash good all right like this all right save that okay good and then i will go ahead and say inside for this video good i'm gonna say video grid dot what the append this video element hey look at this this video element okay so if we save this if we say that's interesting so if we go ahead and save this now let's go back to here let's refresh this uncod cannot read property append off no something's not right here we have video grade i say this right video grid document.getelement document that given by the video grid right video dash grid if i go to room.egs did i save this right here do you see any issue yusuf um i need um can you share uh your screen on skype so i can oh you don't see my skype you don't see my script that's true let's go like give me a second here guys so what do you think what else do you think is the reason why so we cannot read property append of no interesting interesting so video dash great huh which line which is this is inside script.js looks like we do get element by id video grid which is right here okay but when we go ahead and actually append to it looks like it's not actually doing anything for us so my curiosity is like what's actually going on you know video a video grid let's actually console log this ah we can figure this out guys check this out don't worry console that's just live session of debugging guys there we go all right let's see boom okay so it looks like it's snow so it doesn't see that video grid for some for some reason dinah specified div id right video dash grid copy oh actually i know why i know why this is going on i actually check this out guys so i'm gonna no no let's play this one no hold on all right so take this i'm gonna do this really quick this sound effect really quickly guys we're gonna solve it together here so the reason why it's really quickly it's not actually working is because of this because we are loading our our room our script.js way too early instead what we need to do is we need to go ahead and copy this script.js i'm going to put it right below the body right here boom okay right below the body true so now if we save this and we refresh this boom we have a video oh oh dang look at that guys all right all right all right we've got it though which is amazing all right sweet that is great this is great great stuff guys so i'm going to do it for this one we got it working let's go sweet sweet sweets wait wait wait wait all right so look we have a video which is working right it's there okay look at you it's just huge you can literally see me here and here guys which is insane guys drop in the comments below if you think this is insane stuff insane stuff all right insane stuff all right so we've got that part next thing but we got nero who's like the best nero super yes yes this is a mess holy moly you guys are insane tommy's like elbow cough we reach 1.5 k lakhs bro 1.5 k likes let's go heck yeah rory somebody asked why do we put the script.js in there we put the script.js in there because we want the whole document to load and that's only when we can do document.getelementbyid right so if we look at here the script that js loads after we see the html you see if we put it above this html then this line of document that get my id it doesn't actually see it okay because when you read the file it reads it chronologically all right insane people like yo it's insane great awesome yeah let's go insane bro man you guys are at but you guys are epic all right so we've got that part working all right let's kind of chill out here for a second okay chill out here for a second all right so we got that part working next thing is what we've got this working all is good what is the next thing let's go and actually style that so this video great i actually want to make it a little bit smaller okay and you know let's just make that a little bit smaller now to make it a little smaller we're going to create a style.css file so i will go ahead and do it's like public let's go ahead and do for new file we'll say style dot css okay okay this is where our style will be let's go and import our style this as css which is going to be inside here so i'm going to say link boom and i'm going to say style.css just like this so save that okay and inside the style.css i'm going to say inside this.css i'm going to say hey for this video grid video dash grid there's video dash grid i'm going to do like this video that's great i'm going to sue i'm going to say um display flex i will uh i will explain this play effects here in a second guys display flex and i'm going to say justify content uh center for now which is fine just like i just cut the kind of center and then i will actually just that that's all will be okay and then for the actual video itself which is going to be inside the video grid i'm going to say video just like this okay and i will say height is equal to be 300 pixels and then width is equal to 400 pixels okay yeah and that's pretty much it so we're going to save this i'm going to say this let's go back to room.ejs say that let's refresh this hey okay it's still big it's still humongous yeah we i think we need to we need to add the padding and some more attributes yes yes yes exactly exactly but the reason why so it actually is 400 by 300 pixels look at that if you look at this video it's actually 300 just it's huge why is this so huge boom 400 by 300 pixels is that really it high 300 with 400 is this actually 400 pixels guys is it really all right i mean i guess oh am i just really zoomed in oh i'm zoomed in look oh my god that's a relief thank god that's a relief so video four so height is 400 three no we're going to do like this i'm going to say let's go back to i will start the css i'm going to say highest 300 with 400 pixels and then i'm going to say object fit fit i will say cover to make sure that actually it fits within the within you know the actual thing right there beautiful so that my friends now is our first part of the grid which is insane we got our grid pretty much there guys who thinks is insane already guys who think this is insane in saying some stuff seriously like people you're like hold on also we got a donation do we not do we get donations somewhere you said make sure you you make sure you watch look at donations and make sure you let me know so i can i can go ahead and you know i can you know uh shout them out okay so just keep watching the comments okay okay there was like smash the like button yes all right smash that like button guys the bomb you guys are insane i love your comments guys great stuff insane stuff yes all right we got that all right now with that being done this next thing we are going to do is let's go to our plan we want to we got this person done at the blue to allow others to stream their video now guys this is going to be a little bit tougher okay this is where actually we're going to get into the zoom stuff all right are you ready to get into the zoom stuff the actual ability to be able to interact with others and see their videos yeah drop that in the comments below and let's get it started insane insane all right so okay as i'm doing this actually uh yousef like you go ahead you go ahead and let's start this you go ahead and start this whole thing of um you know adding the ability to allow others to stream their video what are we going to do and you go ahead and start it really quickly here okay so uh we will introduce uh the first thing i think we will introduce peer.js okay let's do that well do we well let's not use no and not pds the first step we're going to choose is sockets guys okay yeah while i while i talk about sockets while i do socket stuff let's go ahead you will just explain really quickly here what is what are sockets what is socket so yeah yeah so so uh socket io is for uh uh saktayo is for realtime communication so if um me and us communicate together we will be in the same channel it's an it's used socket is a library but it use web sockets which are very famous for uh asynchronous uh realtime communication as you can see realtime engine so with web what's the different websocket is like an internet protocol but the difference is for example uh different what's the difference between sockets and http so for example with http you can only as a client make a request of the server but the server can only respond he cannot start the request to you but with yeah with socket io the server can communicate with you or you can communicate with them so uh with socket io the server doesn't have to wait for a request for you to uh to start uh a message or something that's why socktio is good for real time it's green it's it does create a channel only one channel it's like a tube so you the the messages and traffic uh go through that yes yes exactly exactly all right sweet so let's get let's continue on i'm going to go back into the code right you guys ready you guys i hope you are because i am so ready all right so the first things first is actually we need to install socket our socket i o in our project correct so let's go ahead and do that so i'm going to quit this but i do not need the server i'm going to do npm install and you hope you guys can see that npm install and i'm going to say is it sakida yo what is it what is it actually dot io so i'm going to say sake right no i didn't write that right suck it suck it hold on socket dot exactly all right stop suck at that yo sweet we got that that's so good that's so good all right so we got sakura installed next thing that we need to actually import that and so it's important right now really quickly so inside here we need to go back to server.js guys that's we're going to use it and we need to go ahead and actually do like this let's go here let's go here boom boom boom let's go make this smaller i'm going to say const io is equal to require okay require and it's going to be socket io okay and then we're going to specify the server i'm going to say server like this okay so this is our server that's how you that's how you import io and inside here inside the socket.yo we are going to create a connection so i'm going to say io dot connection oh wait no i o and then dot on okay on the on when basically when we are connected to when a user is connected to it or i am connected to it i'm saying connection okay basically when you visit the site on connection i'm going to pass in the socket like this and then let's create a function boom just like that okay and inside this socket io connection there's a there's a one thing one main thing that we're going to do which is you know when a user goes in there guys a user will go ahead and do something called they will join the room okay the user will go ahead and join the room and the way i'm gonna explain what that actually means really quickly here but just imagine you when you visit the site okay when you visit the site you will join the room right imagine the whole um zoom is a room so i'm going to say socket okay socket dot on join room okay and then join room comma okay and i will pass it i don't need to pass in anything just yet but i'm going to create you know an empty empty parameters i'm going to create a function okay and then inside this join room this is just going to be console.log console.log hey we have joined the room okay we have joined the room okay join the room just like this okay and so within this join room now what we need to do is actually the following we need to now emit this join room somehow okay we need to tell this bad this this this socket that we have joined the room and the way we're going to do this is we're actually going to do this inside inside um what's it called inside what's inside inside the script.js so if we go to script.js we also need to now import socket io in script.js correct yes exactly exactly exactly let me say fixed it looks like i think i think my audio is good my audio levels i think are fine i think yeah it's not nothing bad about my audio levels so we need to go ahead and now emit this socket first things first go to room.ejs okay and let's import our socket io socket io uh file which literally is just simply is like this i'm going to say script boom this is right here script sagadayo sagario.js okay we've done that exactly save that right at this point on oh looks like we have here he did give us 80. holy moly hey harry thanks so much appreciate it my friend i appreciate it i learned so much from you thank you so much oh man you guys are insane but the only house is hit 2k by the way how's my audio guys i think my audio is fine right i think my idea is good yeah mario is good yeah you guys can hear me well yeah uh harry pressed make uh a donation thank you so much yeah yeah we just i just put that on but yes exactly exactly so with this point on we even put our socket at yo let's go back to let's go back to script.js and we will say when basically when we load this script we're gonna say hey i have joined the room okay so i will go ahead and say uh let's do socket dot what dot socket dot what is it yusef so here uh in script.js we will call the socket so socket dot um no no suck it up emit that we are joining the room yeah yeah exactly it's like that admit so it's like a joint room okay and then for now this is pretty much it that's all we're going to do we're just going to join this room okay join this room right there and now check this out i want you guys to pay attention to this so we're going to emit this join room and then on the server.js we're actually going to accept it you see this right here and we are going to say join room so i want you to pay attention to when we run this server what's going to happen so let's go ahead and run the server again so i'm saying no mon server.js okay oh so it's like can i find module socket io do i not uh what uh did you did you required it on the script i did require it here require a secondary all right no in the front uh indescribe.js no no this is sir that just my friend uh wait uh it's because i actually spelled it wrong so suckadayo my bad guys all right let's refresh this guys all right now it's all good my friends okay all right save that all is good there all right and what we need to expect guys what do you think is gonna happen now what's going to happen is we if we refresh this now okay we've omitted that okay we've admitted that and if we go to our join room uh nothing actually happened which is fine nothing actually happened we didn't actually emit any join room functionality if we let's go and the reason why is actually something broke looks like if we go to our console looks like socket is not defined at script.js and the thing is because we did not import socket io properly so if we go to our thing okay okay good script.js okay and then the top import we import it in the top so yes so we need to import it at the top so we're going to say boom const okay socket socket is equal to i o i o like this oh i owe that just like that okay i owe bo save that okay now but we what yeah but we we need also to import it in the room.egs using the script it's which we did so rumour gs which is this one right here you see no no we need to import uh yeah exactly yeah so we've done that right exactly exactly sweet alright so we've done that you guys think it will work i think i think it will work that's wrong sound i'll just press some weird sound a uncut reference error io is not defined it's not defined so it looks like we did not put it incorrectly i think would you know why uh okay yo just fine can't suck it okay do you guys think what's gonna what do you think why guys huh socket ayo let's go to our room.ejs we're importing sockets okay see socket io all right i think you do import hold on so import so socket io front end boom right there client script all right script source i'm gonna put that in here boom save that okay let's go ahead and refresh this hey look at that hey okay beautiful so the reason why is actually because of a deferred we had a deformed different here which is not necessary for this point okay right you guys said script should be at the bottom yes so we can actually yes so this socket io scribble actually should be at the top it should be at the top because we're using socket io inside script.js in here and you guys are actually really nicely nicely commenting on here holy moly lee is like yo check your file name you know we got script should be at the bottom you submit your audio if you can you submit your audio yeah oh man all right the nice nice nice nice nice the firm means it will be loaded last yeah so because of the because of actually behind the fern here this is also actually this is a great explanation so thanks so much alex or alex defer means it will be loaded last and we don't want do not want that okay all right so with this point on we're going to save this and now if we actually look at our here you see how it says join the room guys you see this is joined the room that means we have just joined the room we have just joined the room okay so sakurai is now working you see that yusuf saketyo is now working which is perfect with this point now let's go ahead and go to our server.js and we have joined the room now with this join room what do we need to do now yusuf okay so on our server when we join the room we we need to add the stream so we join to put the link now uh uh so circuit on join room now we need to join that room exactly so now i need to join that room but the question is what room are we actually going to join okay well this is where we need to get the room a room specific id okay remember actually when we render remember when we render this room right here guys remember this remember this room right we entered this one right and we passed this in and then inside room.ejs we had it where we had it in here so now instead of here i'm going to create a constant called room id and i will say hey const okay room room underscore actually i'm just going to copy this like this all right i'm going to start copying the guys so you guys just have a faster room id is equal to room id that's how we console like the before but we're going to initiate it into an actual variable very important okay very important so with this with this now in there we can now use this room id right this now is available for us inside script.js okay so when we do socket.emit join room okay join room okay we can now join the room with a specific room id so i will say comma and i will pass in the room id okay the room id okay which came initially from where from here makes sense guys does that make sense i hope it does right this is the joint room id we're going to join now so this point on let's go if we go back to our server.js right we have joined the room in here and i will say now i will go ahead and do now like this i will do socket check this out i will do socket socket dot what dot join join room id right but where's this coming from we need to actually pass this in this is a room id is coming from here so now we have joined the room okay we've joined the room so this is all good so we've now joined the room from the specific room id and now we need to do guys is now we actually need to tell you to tell you know our socket hey do we have a user connected we have someone else connected because for example when somebody joins the room we have to now tell them that hey we have a user connected so what i will do is i will do like this i will do socket i'm going to start copying this stuff so you guys can see it boom i do not need this right now just yet okay socket dot to room id the broadcast the broadcast user connected so what is this actually going to do what is this going to do broadcast it's okay the same like the name yes it's gonna broadcast this user connected think of it as like think about this guys think of this as like it's like it's like a phone call almost it's like hey you know for example somebody joined my room right and somebody joined my room and now i'm telling everybody else inside the room that this user has connected so they can add that user to their own to their own uh stream make sense yes it does you guys are asking hey can you watch this video later yes of course you can watch this video later guys that's not even a problem so user connected yeah that's all good and now we actually and now if we go back to script that yes we need to listen on the user connected just like so so i'm going to say socket on socket socket.on okay user user dash connected okay good name okay exactly and then for now i'm just gonna have empty parentheses because that's empty variables and then i'll go i'm going to say i'm using connected uh i'm actually going to create a function called connect to new user connect to new user now this function is not created just yet but i will so what i will create a new function now we'll say connect to new user actually i'm going to say contact user connect connect connect am i saying this right connecting user okay all right connect to the user hold on const connect to your user all right equals i want to say thanks for meeting raj for their donation oh there we go niraj right there hey appreciate it my friend thanks so much guys like i said always i always appreciate donations they feel so good guys always feel so good all right connect to new user now what's going to happen here okay what's going to happen here is a few things and i don't want to talk about it just yet but here's what's going to happen okay inside here this will actually we are going to send now that user like you know our own video stream but i'm not going to do it just yet i'm just going to say i'm i'm just going to console log of this and i'm going to say console log you know a new user uh new user console log new user okay so now what's going to happen user connected is going to connect to a new user which is this and it's going to console log new user now if i refresh this right i don't have this output right here right there's nothing nothing that says hey new user right but if i go ahead and i copy this link okay and a different user approaches me okay new user look at this guys this is insane now awesome i just want you guys to think about this here for a second okay i'm giving some applause this is insane if someone else connected someone else somebody else connected and now i on the front end saw that and this is why we say new user right inside here we emitted that and then everybody knows about this new user but the question now is actually how do we go ahead like how do we identify that user okay this is a good question the way we've identified now i want to say thanks for web dev simplified he just joined in the comments hey where's the simplified where is it it's a little bit yeah it's at the top yeah thanks so much thanks so much appreciate appreciate that simplify seriously guys check out what the simplified guys amazing amazing guy we learned a lot from him in terms of how we in terms of you know how we built the zoom clone amazing amazing guy thank you so much you know we just kind of took that we and we saw how how we can kind of add our own things to it and this is what we are here doing all right all right sweet so i appreciate it i appreciate my friend appreciate it all right so connect to new user which is which is really cool and now at this point what we want to do is is actually to identify that user specifically now in order to identify a user this is where we need to get sent to something called peertopeer okay um with peertopeer you know with with webrtc right we're going to use peerjs to now actually send the streams between different people all right so i want you to just pay attention here really quickly okay okay what is webrtc web rtc dc yes what about you see okay webrtc is uh no i don't like that that definition is a free and open source uh where is it where is it no no no no no no it's a free and open source project that provides web browsers and the multiplications with the realtime communication via simple application programming interface so it is what allows web browsers to kind of communicate that to together in real time all right and so webrtc now webrtc now which is here web uh i'm sorry pgs okay pjs which is here is what's going to use right looks like this is how pjs now wraps the browser's webrtc implementation to provide a complete and configurable easy use peertopeer connection okay and you can see the way we simply do is is we can literally have it you know we can immediately just import the library like this we create a new peer connection and then we can actually connect to other people receive calls and we can send for example video you know on audio and so forth so does that make sense drop in the comments below does that make sense right if it doesn't it's okay we can continue on we can continue on [Laughter] all right so with that continuing on let's go ahead and do this all right first things first that we really need to do is we actually need to install peer js we need to install pds on our server so let's go to server right and we need to go ahead and install pier all right so inside here i'm going to quit test out and i'm saying npm install is it just peer right peer right yousef no okay install peer beautiful peer guess okay all right and now we need to actually run that prgs server okay but the way we're going to do this is like this so we've installed peer okay inside our server.js here's what we are going to do inside here we're gonna we are going to say the following all right we're going to do the following i'm going to copy this really quickly and you guys can simply just watch this all right so check this out so in here we are we imported peer and then inside here then we we use something called express peer server right so basically now the peer server is actually working within together together with express to you know work together and give us this functionality all right and then what we're going to use is we will go ahead and specify to the peer server hey what url are you going to use and the url we're going to use is simply just this right app.use peerjs okay and this is the piercer that that is here all right so save this so our peer server is now live and all good and all we have to do now is simply run the server and we shall be fine so if i do no month server all right we should all be fine in this case still now if we go back to now the front end this is where our peer connections are going to be all right first things first that we need to do is is actually we need to listen on the opening of appear connection well actually no first me to import appear right so if we do peerjs you can see right here this is peer so include the library i'm going to copy this library i'm going to go back to my room.ejs and i'm going to paste this in right here paste it in right here i'm going to save this and that's all good now okay next up we need to create a new peer connection which is in here and so if we go now go to script.js script the gs and let's go ahead and create the new pair connection guys okay now with this there's going to be a few different things that we're going to do all right inside here we're going to specify the id which we don't we don't really need or the id is going to be created automatically by uh by peer so we don't we do not need one okay but in terms of options okay we're going to specify the following path i'm going to say it's path is going to be dash peer js okay and the way where from where we got that is back from the server.js in terms of the actual host the host is going to be whatever host that we're hosting is on so i'm gonna say host that's just gonna be slash so host basically whatever host we're hosting this on either localhost or you know heroku whatever maybe that's where it's gonna be next port port is gonna be four four three no throw 30 30 for now because we're on local host my friend yeah 30 30 all right and the reason why it's 30 30 because it's because our node.js server is on 30 30. hopefully that made sense all right so that my friends is all good okay now what we need to do is we need to listen on the peer connection okay so now we have peer which is here okay so now it's going to happen you remember how we did this join room check this out we're gonna wrap this i'm gonna say peer dot on okay dot on hey when i open this connection open this connection and i get a specific id an id is simply just think of it as like you have your own id okay you have your id id okay boom right there so this id is going to be passed in here actually let's go under console.log what is this id so you guys can see it really quickly here console.log that id let's go back to our zoom clone let's refresh that's i can remove this for now let's go back to our zoom clone this is the id see this id right here this my friend is the id it's a specific id for me for the person who's actually uh you know connecting right and now in this socket that i met right i'm gonna say hey this specific person actually has joined this room and i will pass in the id right so we've passed an id but obviously we need to now right we need to now listen to that id okay so what i will do at this point is go to server.js and inside this room id i'm going to say user id right this user id okay and now when i emit user connected i can tell everybody hey guys here is the user id here's the user that has been connected okay okay so user connected i'm going to say comma i'm going to say comma and inside this i'm going to say just simply user id i'm going to emit this for everybody else that's saying that hey certain user has just connected all right and now that we have that let's go back to our script.js all right and where we are listen to connect user connected we can now actually listen on the user id guys you see this this is interesting stuff interesting stuff uh hold on make sure let me make sure that this is that we're all good i'm gonna say user id user id user id okay again user id and i will pass in this user id into the here user id beautiful connected to new user and this is going to call connected to the user which is going to call this function and since we're passing the user id we obviously we need to use that user id and say user id just like this okay and boom now we're here so if i do console log now console log a user id okay user id okay check this out what's going to happen let's go ahead and go back to our pom pom pom all right so obviously we don't have anything console log just yet but if i but if someone else joins my room right look this is someone else's user id this user id guys came from this other user that is insane insane guys insane guys all right so we have got that this is all good so what what am i going to do now at this point now we're going to use peer connections we're going to use peer now to connect to to our user the way we're going to do this is now we're going to say here to this user id let's call that user id okay i'm going to call this the other user who connected i'm going to call him okay i'm going to say const actually i'm going to just copy this specific things i'm going to call that user boom hold on i'm going to copy and paste this here boom called that user so here's here's what we have we have peer peer which comes from here okay peer call the user id and then we'll also we'll call in the user id with a certain stream which is actually we should be importing this stream from here okay now where is the stream coming from check this out the stream is should be coming from is coming from here stream save that and it's actually coming from where it's becoming from in the promise right so what does that mean yusef so it's uh actually meaning that the problem when using.then we are receiving the user's videos which we call the stream and we're passing it to the socket uh do the suck so we are passing the stream of the user yeah what is that circuit.on and all of those code is inside.then yeah so so that what that means guys what that means that if we actually in the uh on the user connected we actually need to go ahead and remove this right here and put this inside this stream right because we need to listen here on my stream let's go ahead and wait for my stream and actually then send it to everybody else right so when someone else connected right we have someone else who connected i'm going to save this i'm going to connect to that new user i know it's a little confusing guys but trust me it will make sense in a second here then i'm going to call that user someone else's user for example yousef okay i'm going to call yusuf i'm going to send him my stream and i'm going to create a new video element okay for for him and i'm going to call on stream user video stream so this right here this stream when when i basically re receive some of the stream i'm going to add that video stream does that make sense exactly i know this is a little bit like it's a little bit like like um it's a little bit odd i will i will say that it's a little bit odd all right so yeah it's a little bit odd so just check check this out so i'm gonna say advocation obviously with this add video stream function we do not have that just yet okay but we are going to create it right now all right so what i will say now so this stream biscuit is usually just so you know this right here this stream is yusef's stream no actually no yeah that that is use of stream yes so i will go ahead and create a function called const add video stream okay and i'm going to use this function right here let me see where uh i'm going to actually copy this and so you guys can simply can simply you know use it later on boom boom function add video stream but i'm going to do it in use six way it comes to add video stream boom boom add video stream what's going to happen now this is going to add a video stream right it's gonna it's going to go ahead and add the stream itself is going to be have a source which is this the one that we're passing in then we're going to wait on a listener actually we already have this look we already have a video stream right here what am i saying my bad my hat we have this streamer here we're going to call admin stream which is simply going to call this function right here so if i save this if i save this okay if i save this okay let's make sure that we are all good if i save this right here all right and now when a new user connects let's see when a new user connects we should technically see their stream are you ready are you ready to see this let's do it okay let's do it technically we should see this now so let me just make sure that i'm all good that i'm not like you know i'm not completely misusing anything guys completely misusing things guys all right i'm going to save this boom this is fine boom that's fine okay okay i'm going to now command c okay and we have nothing here now the reason why i have nothing here is for the following reason we now need to answer the call so i have called look i went ahead and i called yusuf okay i have called yusuf okay but i now need to answer because yusuf is going to call me right so i need to answer this call as well all right so the way that's going to work is the following so i'm literally just going to going to copy this really quickly here let's go back to the top on the stream right here pier so peer on call i'm going to answer his call and i'm going to go ahead and add a video stream from yusuf okay i'm going to save this i'm going to save this let's go back to our coding here let's refresh this okay i'm going to save this boom boom boom hey oh hold on look at that hold up there's too many people two people uh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait audio false hold on hey hold on hold on let's do this again one more time one more time guys look at this guys we got two people connected this is insane insane guys insane stuff guys like like i said here's what happened i know this is this is a really hard one kind of to understand guys but right the way this kind of works is like i said is we are connect to new user we're connected this to this new user right here okay and we are sending this new user our own stream okay we're sending this user here our own stream through here okay i don't know are we sending no we're calling the user through here we're calling the user okay and then basically when the user calls us we answer it and we add it to the video stream exactly does that make sense yes it it does yes it does sweet so at this point on guys how insane is this somebody asking mean somebody's asking um let me ask you let me see some questions guys some of you guys are asking how many people are connected at once um i don't know we'll we'll test this out how many people can be getting to that one i think unlimited right a lot of people i'm limited people can get them once that'll be interesting let's see who else is like hey thanks bobby appreciate it bobby appreciate my friend yes the github code will be shown to you guys we'll be showing you guys now we got look at we got the streaming guys there right yeah must you generate ids using peers so peer again guys uh generates ids automatically okay those ids i'd be generated automatically all right what you guys see right here if i if you go where is my peer you see this appear open right appear open this is where the ids get automatically generated this id is automatically generated by this specific peer object all right so hopefully that kind of makes sense some things user id is unique to each user exactly yes yeah yes yes hello what's up hey guys guys so also awesome to have you on here like i said we've done a small part of it now which is insane drop in the comments below if you're pumped as we are as we are yeah steve is like no it's not unlimited your your broadband will be maxed out at about nine people unless you use like some really fast internet or something so yeah but me and you have tried it was insane it was insane oh man wait wait wait so holy [ __ ] we're all guys this we're about at about two hours going on and in okay so yusuf we've done this what's next guys we have two people now that are able to talk to each other which is really cool guys right which is really cool before we go on i just want to just want to mention you guys we have a master class for javascript if you guys are interested in checking us out check out our master class down below okay and then we also have a profit with javascript course if you want to learn more stuff like this okay you're gonna learn more stuff like this so we have a profit javascript course which is also insane so much content from you we have weekly coaching calls on there you know uh two weeks coaching calls between uh success coaches right we you know with 15 modules um make sure to check us out check it out link is built down below and we'll continue on and go all right yeah for uh i need to mention that for some that who doesn't know uh i was a pwj uh student and this course helped me achieve more and learn a lot to become a web developer yes yes yes yes exactly exactly so guys let's simply continue on now the next thing that we need to we need to work on is actually going to be what it's going to be the styling of this application am i right yousef are we going to style this now yeah yes let's style this application okay so this one's gonna be a little bit more tough for now oh my god this is gonna oh man all right all right let's let's go to room.room.edu yes all right so inside here okay we need to create a few things if you look at our you know previous application which is do you uh do you have a previous a previous app running let me look at look at the code let me look at the code here uh yeah yes you do yeah you do yeah you do yeah it's here send you a link yeah yeah you do it i got it i got i got it you said thank you i got it perfect so this is our previous app that we that we have right here guys okay all right so our goal is to get to this all right so a few things that are going on here what do we have we have a you know a row we have a row that looks you know like this okay we have two columns one column and then another column so let's just simply you know start out with the main with the with the main class i'm going to inside here i'm going to say here let's create div can you see him by the way why does it do like this i'm curious what is this orange thing that it just kind of shows all right uh i don't know i don't know why yeah where am i all right so inside here i'm going to say div class because i'm selecting it oh that's why i'm like what that's going on div classmate that's going to be where our main you know zoom clone lives okay div classmate okay we have inside this zoom we have the left section we have the right section guys okay so the left section here is we have div class main underscore underscore left okay okay that's gonna be for the left section then we're going to have the right section just like so oop so we'll say div class main underscore is called right right okay beautiful inside the left section we're going to create a div uh for the video grid so i'm gonna say div class main videos and then inside that this is where we're gonna piss put put in the video grid correct oh yeah so we have the main container that contains the left and the video main exactly exactly all right and now in the main right in the main right then we're going to have that's where that's where we're going to have the chat so in the main right we're going to have simply the chat so in the main right let's go ahead and do in the main right let's go ahead and do um i'm going to say div main header i think maybe div class okay main header yeah so we need to specify that's a chat okay and i'm going to say h6 there's gonna be chat okay okay all right so that's fine okay now within this guys you probably won't see too much of a big difference you know not nothing too much going on here but in the main left what else we got we got main videos and then we have something else guys what else do we got anyone to know we have what we have controls remember these controls right here these are the controls okay i'm going to say div and i'm going to say class and then main i'm just going to show controls just like so controls all right and this is where our controls are going to live right now at this point on let's go ahead and simply just save this right and let's see actually what we have so i'm going to save this i'm going to go back to our zoom clone obviously we have two people just fine i'm going to refresh this boom right we got chat but we get nothing else which is completely fine all right okay all right so at this point on let's go ahead and right click inspect element and let's go ahead and start styling this guys you read the style i'm hope i'll help you write this down because i'm ready to style so for this main function for this main function i'm going to say that hey for this one specific one it's going to be like so so div main i'm going to say hey the height for this is going to be 100 vh right so means 100 vertical height so you can see now it's 100 vertical height okay and then i'm also going to say display is going to be flex right display flex now you can see how we have kind of the main left is the left hand side and the main right is now on the right hand side right now i do want to go ahead and actually now now specify how much kind of space i want each the left side and the right side to take up and how do we do that you guys know drop in the comments below you guys know how to do that yusuf how do we do it so we need to specify the uh how much space the left section takes up and the main the right side takes up i see i see so we need to specify the mean width and max weights i think well okay kind of yes and no yes or no what i'm going to say is for the main left and main right i'm going to say i'm going to add in a um kind of like a flex item so for the main left okay i'm going to say that the weight for this one is going to be flex what 0.8 okay you see now it's 0.8 for the y one i'm going to say the flex it's it's going to be flex 0.2 just like this okay just like that you see that and then that's pretty much it now we have the last section and the right section and i can literally go ahead and i can i'm going to copy this specific one i'm going to copy this and what do we guys need to do we need to go ahead and go to style.css i'm going to say main dot main boom right need to create that style so height 100 vh okay let's go back to our main left and main left is flex 0.8 main right is like 0.2 so i'm gonna say main underscore underscore left flex flex it's going to be 0.8 and then main right right main right main underscore let's go right is going to be flex 0.2 there we go flex right 0.2 right beautiful so that my friends is working okay save that refresh this and voila ear horn guys now guys i just want to kind of i just want to kind of take a look guys guys so i say thanks so much we have 2 000 likes which is insane almost a dozen likes guys let's take this to 2k it is almost there guys insane stuff inside stuff by the way thank you thank you so much guys insane stuff i appreciate you guys so much you guys are you guys are the best you guys are the best it's all i can say because it's the best all right with this what's now you guys know well i know so this let's look a look at now this main left section okay main left actually has what the main videos which is here and then controls so the controls are going to take up some space and the menus are going to take up some space as well right so the way we make that work is how you sift in order to make sure that the controls are at the bottom and the videos are at the top how do you make that work so you want to the the controllers in the bottom right yes what do we do now in this case i think uh we align it we are going to use flex all right flex we're going to use flex guys oh no flex flag flax is the answer to everything all right so for the main left okay i'm going to say the main left i'm going to say display flex display flex okay and then i'm going to say flex direction flex direction is equal to column okay so now we have my videos in here and my controls at the bottom okay but it's still not good okay because the main left right you need to make videos kind of main videos needs to be kind of needs to push down everything else right so for in order for that to work i will need to sim i need to simply say main videos hey flex grow one right so now main video is going to grow as much as it can main control is obviously hidden right now because ebay controls has nothing inside of it okay inside the main videos i'm going to specify here the background color for this one is going to be what black boom okay so we're getting somewhere it doesn't look good just yet but we're getting somewhere then what i'm going to do is i'm going to center these two right videos right so you can see we have two videos these are imagine imagine these are two people and the guys drop in the comments below how do we go ahead and center them well the way we do that is simply we also simply use what you said what do we use justify content yes justify content so we're also going to use flex for this right because this specific one has has a video grid right which is video right here video right here so inside here i'm going to say for this main videos i'm going to say display flex as well okay i'm going to say justify content center boom and what for the vertical alignment what do we do what do we do all right align item center exactly so i'm going to say align items center there we go so now we have centered our grid which is better that's exactly what we need i'm literally going to go ahead and copy this specific thing the specific css and i'm going to go back to main videos and i will say here and say hey dot main i'm just going to scroll videos i'm going to paste this in okay i'm going to go back to let's see main controls i do not need this but did i change anything else besides that no nothing right nope nothing no so save this main videos let's refresh this refresh it okay one thing what do we miss here i need to make main left what tracks direction come uh no you see the main left you see this main videos is only like it does not take up as much space as it needs to so for that we need to go we need to go tomorrow well yes but i need to specify in yeah i need to go to main left i need to tell main left hey main left that main left we need to have display flex for this one no you're not writing it in main right oh did i oh man all right sweet sweet mean left right there display flex and then it's going to be flex direction column right because because we want to have make sure this is in the column so refresh this refresh this look at that now it's there let's go ahead and now remove you see the spacing at the top that's simply just body margin and potting potting did you say potting yeah padding guys by default yeah so let's go to remove remove that i'm going to go back to here i'm going to go up and i'm going to say hey body i'm going to say margin is going to be what zero right and then padding is

right here are are the following so in order for us to kind of have these main controls you know we have a few blocks we need to have them in a row right so i'm going to say main controls i'm going to have them be display flex that's the first thing okay it's playing flex okay and then i'm going to and that that's all i'm going to do right now display flex and that yeah that's that's all i'm going to do but in terms of the background color what does the background color of this mean uh do you know main control yeah background color yeah background color of this one is going to be like so 1c1 e20 right okay background color background color boom right there okay right now obviously i would say hit the other stuff but it's okay now now i'm going to say the color which is going to be the color of the icons and the text is gonna be the following so i'm gonna say color color is going to be what color is going to be this beautiful so now we have a color okay i'm going to now for main controls i'm going to add some padding to it padding five pixels and now we have some padding to it which is which is great okay next thing we next thing let's go ahead and um for specific buttons i want to make these buttons like you know uh kind of like um vertically aligned so you can see how the the icon is in the left hand side and then the text on the right hand side guys how do we how do we make that work do you guys remember how do we change the words from horizontal to vertical you guys remember five four three two one well the way we do that is going to be inside the main controls block okay and inside the main control box i'm gonna say well hold on inside the main controls block i'm going to say actually main controls button i'm going to say display flex okay and i'm going to say flex direction is column there we go now it's a column right so that's exactly what we need okay next up for main controls block main controls block we need to say here this maker choose block let's go ahead and do display flex and make that be right the horizontal right so main controls block is what's in charge of all the buttons i'm going to say hey all your buttons should be horizontally aligned okay beautiful yeah exactly see that you see that so literally let's go ahead and copy what we just had so main controls i'm going to copy this for the main controls okay let's go to our installer css let's go down i'm going to say dot main others also controls controls okay that's going to be this display flex so save that that's going to be that main controls okay all right next up for the main controls block is simply just going to be display flex so if i do uh main controls block main oh trolls underscore underscore block right is that underscore or two or one underscore it's block it's gonna be no display simply flex display flex right okay for the main controls button guys right i'm going to copy the specific one let's call it do dot main controls button right boom display flex deflection column all is good there okay real good now yes i think so save this let's refresh this guys you ready hey look at that we have mute stop video that's all good there we just got that working okay now let's go ahead and add some padding hold on boom hey yes you guys we are deploying this as well it's going to happen really quickly we're going to deploy this really fast as well so we've got that going inside the main controls button next up what we need to do is going to be add some just you know just some basic padding right there so this main controls button okay uh inside here we have flex direction let's go ahead and do justify content in order to center it right let's enter the center center and then guys how do we center it as well vertically drop it in the comments below it's going to be align items center okay for the padding let's go ahead and do for the padding i'm going to say padding is going to be eight pixels eight pixels 10 pixels now what what does this mean guys when i say eight pixels 10 pixels okay this means that the top and the bottom are 8 pixels the left and the right are both 10 pixels all right and then i'm going to say the menu width for this one is going to be simply just 80 pixels so i want to set the main window width for this one okay and then i'm going to say cursor is going to be pointer boom all right so look at this we're starting to get somewhere guys we're starting to get summer this is insane same stuff i'm going to go ahead and copy this oh okay all right um put it in here boom beautiful okay that's so good so now with that kind of set with that kind of said what um what i want to do is actually the following so with that said let's go ahead and refresh this all right stop video is there all of that is there beautiful yeah next stop what's what's what's next uh dj you said um thank you so we next we need the security participants the in the middle and the leaf chat exactly all those other ones but i kind of want to change kind of this funny see how the sun fund is like yeah it's like it's an icky font because our font here is so much more better right it's so much more better and it's really you know it's really just a matter of just changing the font style so if you look at our font right well it is actually because it's coming from where um actually you know what let's change that in a little bit you'll you'll see where it's coming from later we'll change that in a second here i think it's coming from do we import bootstrap right import bootstrap is that why yeah i think it's from bootstrap no i think we didn't i think we did i think we did because it's right now the actual font family is just apple apple system which is interesting okay it's apple system i like it i like it all right main thing now let's go ahead and add the other ones so i'm going to go ahead and go run the gs and i'm going to do this really quickly guys because i don't want to spend too much time just typing you guys want to see me type as well so i'm going to copy just you know a few more control blocks that i have and you guys will see what they are so here boom yeah yeah we use bootstrap yeah yeah so look at this see that main controls block main controls block so inside miss makatro block this is where we have the security participants and chat it's the same thing as the other ones right there right and then for this one we have a leave meeting as well okay leave meeting so i'm going to save this i'm going to go back to here let's check out what we got hey look at that now obvious this not does not work properly as we wanted to all right and that's there's a reason guys how do we how do we make it go from here to kind of like here how do we how do we have that happen you get anybody know drop in the comments below well the reason why is because of flex okay if you look at main controls right you have display block one then you have what display black two to select three instead of saying hey flex start is the direction or is the actual you know alignment i'm going to say what i'm going to say um justify content what space between look at that now we're getting some of our friends right so space between so if i literally if i go to main controls stylus css main control which is here i'm going to say justify content space between just like this nice hey look at this look at this guys all right so much better so much better i know we are almost there almost there almost there next thing i want to do is i want to change this i the the font um another font but this the size of these icons um so let's just do that right now really quickly here um it's really i'm just gonna just literally going to say um for this button but i'm going to say vi boom boom make controls button target the i font size 24 pixels refresh this hey now we have a bigger button all right for the leave meeting we also need to set that as well so let's go ahead and

is so we have main header and now we need to add the chat window and then the input box all right in the input box all right so let's go to let's go ahead and let's see i'm just trying to think here for a second here yes let's go to style let's go to room.eds and inside this main header we're going to create a few different other things okay first things first is going to be is going to be the main chat window so i'm going to say div class main i'm just going to scroll chat actually i'm just going to copy and paste the send so you guys don't see me typing there's only reason for me to type boom right there first things first here is we have the main chat window guys okay and this is going to contain all the messages okay then the set the third day is going to be the main message container which is going to contain the input all right right the input suite so i'm going to go ahead and save this right here let's go back to our code let's refresh our code and obviously it's there it's i know it's not pretty it's not hold on hold on all right i'm gonna give myself some applause hold on so in order to style this here do you hear that sound by the way or no no by the way can you can you can you mute yourself for a little bit because i can i can hear like uh echo from you for some reason i don't know why okay yeah but yeah there we go there you go and then kind of unmute yourself kind of as as we're talking i know but for some reason i hear an echo from you all right so let's go ahead and style this so we have the main header the main chat window and the message container okay in order for us to kind of take up all the space wait user where'd you go don't just leave guys bring back yusuf all right in the main header the first things first is for the main right i'm going to say that this is going to be a display flex right display flex all right display flex and obviously it's currently in horizontal view but we want to make it in vertical cue so i'm going to say flex direction flex direction column all right now it's in the column beautiful all right we have main header we have main chat window main message container and that that's pretty much it okay um with with that being said with that being said uh next thing is gonna be let's let's let's actually i'm just looking through my stuff here look at my stuff here for the main header um let's set the background color for this what is the background color for this whole main right thing huh anybody know because i don't know what is the background color for this what is main right background color for this right is is actually border 24 no but what is the background color you know yeah yeah background color for main right right yeah 24 to 23 background color not not right here here inspect oh it's in yeah main right right here yeah 20 24 23 24. there we go so i mean right oh my bad i thought you were talking about petting i don't know why i said i need the background color all right let's go ahead and add some background color to this boom now we have our second background color beautiful for the main header uh all i need for this one is gonna be i'm going to add a simple like uh color color this is going to be f5 f5 f5 i'm just going to go ahead and copy this boom color and now i'm going to say it's it's text line center so i'm saying text align is center okay so that's going to be the chat okay all right so that we need also some borders yeah we'll add a border as well uh i'll add a border on the left hand side for this now we have the main header now we have the main chat window and this windows is it's nothing not not so much anything but the main thing we need to understand is the fact that we want this chat window to kind of extend all the way horizontally right we want this to take up as much space right so how do we do that well again we're using flex guys remember right so we're using flex on this specific main right so if we simply say main chart window we say what anybody know you say flex what grow one then that will go ahead and actually grow so if we go to mention window you see now now the main chat window is actually growing uh to the most that i can for the main message container yeah yeah yeah for the main messages container right i'm gonna i'm going to go ahead and say that this is going to be padding i see padding i'm gonna say 22 pixels and then 12 pixels okay just like this and then i'm also going to say this is display flex okay right there so that kind of moves that that input in there let's go ahead and copy all the other things we just did so this is on the main right let's go back to our style of css okay dot main underscore underscore right no no no it's not in the main right huh it is main right no it's main messenger container check yeah yeah main right next up is gonna be main header so let's go ahead and copy the specific part so i'm gonna say dot main main underscore underscore header boom and then this one's gonna be i'm going to copy this specific part boom boom all right for the main chat window flex girl once i'm going to say main dot main honest chat window let's see just make sure chat just one underscore window boom and this is going to be flex grow what one right am i right yes flex grow one save that let's go now go to main messages container and it's going to copy this specific part and let's go into dot main dot main on screen script messages dot container like this right yeah the main message container right okay beautiful beautiful wait yusuf are you still there

this input see this input right here i do not like how it looks here all right the way i'm going to style this is is i'm going to say the following i'm going to say may i'm going to just go to copy this guys because i'm just because running out of time here main message container input i'm going to focus on the input and i'm going to say hey the fact scroll for this one is going to be one the background so the reason why i say flag scroll one is because i want this input to take up the full width correct the full width okay i'm going to say the border is none and i'm going to say the background color is transparent because right now the background color is like iffy you know it's like it's like white it's like ah so i'm going to save this and refresh this and boom look at that that message looks just like this it's it's completely what just how we want it to look like next up is i actually want to go ahead you see how we have like this you know the the font is like not the best here and the reason why it's not the best here guys is actually because for this one we're actually using bootstrap we're using bootstrap on this specific application so let's import bootstrap

productive will this be if there are a 10 20 50 i'm not sure i just know that i know we tried with four people right don't know what we tried for now that seemed to work pretty fine all right sweet guys sweet guys uh i can't barely hear yousef so let's turn up your volume all right okay i i uh added the game yeah boy yeah can you hear me now right yes we can hear you now you guys hear yusuf yeah drop in the comments below you guys ready to continue going yes let's do it all right let's get to it okay so um so so the first thing we want to do is we get the input value so okay so let's go to the script.js here and in the so so i want to get this input here so okay uh you you are you are sharing the vs code right that's always good oh it's good you can trust me so the first thing yeah i do bro okay so i won't get my message so i'm gonna create a variable called message and here i'm going to use jquery since uh uh uh uploaded it when he uh added jquery uh when he added bootstrap he already added um where we're in the link as you can see here by default when you use bootstrap you need to add jquery but in bootstrap 5 jquery is not supported anymore but so let's keep going so let's go and get the input of the file of the input so here and try console.log here and type message uh but we want to get this input message when the user type enter because we didn't add a button so so the first thing we uh we we need to do is we call html which is the main file here using jquery of course so you see the dollar sign it replaces this gquery like this so we use the dollar sign so here we are calling the html the the file the html file which is dot egs uh to listen if a key down pressed key down pressed and we call the function so we call a function e we use es6 oy so if e dot so you said what you could do you can actually probably copy some of the code and just kind of explain it so copy some of the code like key down and they can explain it right because then they'll understand better yeah yeah okay so here we made a condition if e which is the event of typing the key keyboard so uh 13 is equal to the code of tapping the enter key key so for example every keyboard every key in your keyboard has a unique number so the enter has the key 30. and we we want that we don't want to send an empty text so we we want to check that uh the message here i tape let's replace this by text not message so we want to to check if the message the value in the input is not not empty not zero different of zero so it will be either one or one character or more so so so we when we press enter we send the message and here we are calling socket.emit so in socket we have socket.email and socket.on socket.emit will send and socket.on will receive so here we are sending from the front end a message as you can see so on event message we are sending the value of the input which is the the message that the user type and then after the user uh press enter we need to clear the input we don't want the message to stay there so we just want to send so yeah now let's for example go go to the front end and test it test if when nas press enter we should um we need to console log it before so yes i'm going to save it uhhuh go ahead console. no no console.log uh we need message on the text now if nas can go to the browser as i even go to the browser okay refresh okay okay type something and press enter and go to the console console okay so let's that's weird because message is not defined oh we we replaced it with html we say because we didn't use msg here there's no keyword mmc no i think it's like msg javascript 55 so 55 because you're here right here see right yeah exactly but you actually want you want to simply console.log here correct yeah exactly so that's refreshed so when i press the enter i want to console log the uh the input hey ready guys you ready guys hey let's go look at that uh see we we here we are not getting the value so now we we need to add dot val here so let's bug and uh dot value so because we are just getting the element so okay so let's go let's refresh this one more time guys all right refresh this boom look at that now we are getting the value now go yousef go you sorry we make sure that we get the message so let's go back to script.js so when i type it uh circuit dot emit message i want to send that message hollywood frank just gave us twenty dollars thanks so much frank twenty bucks wow appreciate it my friend thank you i really appreciate all right that's cool i love it then thanks frank thanks frankie uh so uh we need now to receive the the message that we sent when we hit enter to the server and the server will send it again to the front and we pop it up to the user so we go to the server the server.js yeah here yeah yeah i will keep going or wait for you oh okay oh okay i thought you you were saying okay anyways okay like i guess i'll continue on all right no no no okay uh yeah i thought you you were saying no no continue on let's go keep going okay so uh we want when the and the connection uh when we uh when when we the user is connected we want to receive the message so uh here on io dot on connection here ender socket the two so we want to do socket socket so we still we the user is connected to the other so here's socket on so this one will listen for the message so if you when you press enter this one will receive it and it will receive the message which will be the uh argument for our function okay and we want to send that function uh send this message to the front again so to the same and uh be careful we want to send it to the same room not to every room so make sure that we send it to that room id and we emit a create message here so now we are sending it we emit with create message and we send the message here now we want to receive the message to the new user so we go to script.js here and we do and we do socket dot on where are you typing okay yeah here okay go rocket dot on create message we should make sure that it's the same here the same string here as here so let's type create message it will take an argument which will be message and it will be function so now we got the message back so for example uh for example if we cancel that uh no clg console.log message we should uh see but let's make make it specific to that one so this is coming from server nice okay so let's save that and save in server.js here and now it can go to the i will save scrolls too okay so let's go ahead and refresh this okay now see if i type something it's actually not it's not going to emit actually oh it is okay so this is coming from the server okay okay okay now uh we almost did the actually hold on guys holy [ __ ] did you guys just see that guys this is insane this is coming directly from the server guys this deserves like hold on this is like uh like a dji one you know yeah i mean that's that's pretty cool guys we just we talked to the servers or talked to us same stuff yeah see so uh we we did the hard stuff here we made the connection now easy stuff so now we want to uh show the message in the chat okay right so uh i'm going to use here so he uh in the room.egs here you see that oh wait i'm not in the right one so in the room.ejs okay scroll down go down here you see that ul tag here we created so we want to append our messages here so we go to the uh script.js and and we remove this and so we we get the el ellen using jquery so ul and oh one third we want to append the message to it append and now we want to append the message uh but we want to add le tags which is the children of ul so we use template string open the tag ally close ally oh i'm gonna copy it paste it it will be better okay so as you can see here this is our code here so uh we will append to the ul cha and when every message comes we will add a tag called li which will have a class called message and then inside of it it will be have a user because uh user and uh in the bottom the message so now we appended it so for example if not uh let's save that and let's go to the so let's save that okay can you check it see it you guys ready to see this you guys see it drum roll drama please yes hold on okay and oh my bad okay what's uh so it's okay message yeah dot concrete it's weird because we received the message let's try i need to append the ally now to the message yeah we did that okay yes oh i think i think yeah yeah i think i understand yeah so so yeah it's because it should be instead the dot then they all should be instead inside the the prompts oh you know what i mean inside the what promise oh the user media promise yep yeah so we need to copy all of this control x and it should be not here so let me check the what is the progress where is the promise right there yeah so we should it should should be inside this one no not there right here at the bottom okay paste it in here good paste it save it and let's try again yeah but hold on let's make sure that we have hold on you you say you've pasted it right yeah all of it okay let's make sure that we just have a tab save that let's see refresh it boom um weird so let's take a look at hold on let's let's think about this guy so look so we have sagada on right so let's let's look at the console log i think there's a few issues because uh before we remove console.log it worked so let's see how long a message okay let's go and save this okay let's go ahead and refresh this okay boom all right so that the console message this is this is inside wait now let's let's make sure that we actually remove this we do not need this right here okay okay so like the message let's finish again boom okay so this is coming from here correct create message just want to make sure guys okay ready let's take a look at this this is like a debugging section okay okay boom refresh create message so we are creating the message i think the problem here becomes actually is here i think you're trying to you're trying to uh basically get a ul that maybe does not exist so if we do japan yeah so ul what if what if we do dot messages instead okay let's try that message let's try that message so if we go to script.js okay if we say dot messages okay okay and then i'm gonna say that append li class message that's what we're going to append okay make sense let's see yes okay let's go back to here it's always been there guys the color is not right oh man i need to have like a boo sound boo guys did you do you guys know what we're talking about guys it's because the fact that because the fact that it's there look it's there it's just the color is not there look it's there it even worked before yeah so it even worked before so we don't we don't need to have this sucker on here but that's fine it's already there so let's go and actually style this so i'm going to style this here for a second here yusuf okay i'm gonna style your messages here for a second uh while you're kind of you know you're kind of doing your stuff so for this guys to style the messages right uh what do we have let me see i'll just make sure messages yeah it's simply just a color white and and just you know list style is none so if we go ahead and go to style the css and we simply do dot messages messages okay paste this in color is white list style none if we refresh this now okay should we type it now ready ready hey let's go there it is guys check this out this is amazing um why is there i'm curious why there's so much padding in here boom messages oh because it's a list it's a ul do you have like a ul on here hold on you well all right this is fine so look we have a user guys check this out guys airhorn hey let's keep this going so we have the messages and look they're actually transferring to different people so uh yusuf let's keep going what what's the next thing we need to do in terms of messages yusuf i can't hear you hello yo yo yo yo yo yo can you hear me go ahead uh can you go to the same room and open another one with the same room ready let's try this yeah you guys ready for this are you guys ready for this i hope you are all right let's go all right okay so let's go ahead and shall we type now from the future hello hello where is it loaded look at this guys insane stuff what have we just done here we have done we biscuit we just created a a real time chat app so not only you creating a real time video app but you were also creating a realtime chat app inside stuff and that's all i'll say um guys okay so if you think it's insane if you guys if you're pumped for this drop in the comments below and we'll continue going yep okay so uh back to the browser browser yeah keep keep typing uh until the message reached a lot keep sending messages send the messages because when you keep typing you see that you see you see this behavior we don't want that behavior we want to scroll down only in this message so let me go to server uh not server let me go to vs code okay so yeah i will automatically scroll inside that div only not inside all the the the window so we we will create a function we will call the scroll uh scroll bottom okay let's do that right now okay uh we will we will call it an uh here until below this one so control p now let's jump and create this function so it will be const scroll bottom all right okay so i have already uh the function let's just explain it all right and here it is an extra bracket so you you see we have in the room js the main d for the chat which is main shot window so i want to get this steve and in this same time i want to scroll top and get the i assigned the that div to the variable d i can for example name it let v i always prefer that to be honest okay d dot scroll top and b which will take argument the scroll height so for example if you now try go to try it we will call the scroll function scroll to bottom function automatically whenever we uh hit a new message let's try that ready oh hold on come on let's try it through here let's refresh this ready guys so try it boom boom let's see you two bubba yeah but the reason why it's actually like that is actually because i need to set the overflow to scroll right so let's go ahead and set the overflow scroll so really quickly guys what i'm going to do is i'm going to set overflow scroll for this specific for this specific messages container so if we go to main chart yeah if we go to room.ejs we have the messages right or the main chat window i'm sorry if we go to style css and we go to main chat window right we say overflow y scroll or scroll down yeah yeah so i'm going to save that i'm going to refresh this really quickly here so now if we type guys boom boom come on come on ready ready look at that hey let's go guys this is now overflow scroll right so now it's now overflowing and because of yusuf's right dysfunction guys this uses function of where he goes ahead and scrolls to the bottom right as we type it's always going to scroll the bottom which is just so real freaking cool right yep yeah so by the way guys also want to say uh thanks to hold on thanks to charles appreciate the twodollar nation appreciate my friend this is awesome guys keep it going guys let's continue on let's continue going yeah thank you so much guys that means a lot for us yeah it means a ton yeah it means a ton all right all right all right guys almost done almost done so close just a little bit more left and and we'll be able to deploy this are you ready to deploy it yeah are you guys ready to deploy it drop that in the comment below if you're ready to deploy this are you ready to deploy but we need something missing can you know what's missing guys what's missing guys what's missing i don't know what's missing guys what's missing i don't know i don't know what's missing we need to stop and mute enable those buttons oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay all right let's enable the mute buttons and the style video buttons all right you ready let's do it yeah it will be so easy just yeah so go so use of let's go ahead and quickly i'm just going to do this really quickly here yusuf okay okay go ahead let's go ahead and we're going to do this really quickly guys so for the stop and mute button the first things first is we need to add a function to actually you know to enable the start stop and mute button so the let's go ahead and add a mute button so a mute function so i'm going to copy my mute function here and i'm going to paste into scripted gs and here it is now i'm going to explain what this new function does here in a second right so this is here we're going to mute mute our video okay video very quickly here so it know of course me to now call this function when we call the mute button am i right dropped in the comment below so what i'm going to do is go to that you yes and inside this right here mute button i will create it on click function that's going to call the mute button so the unclick function is simply going to look like this boom exactly boom called the mute function right click on that button so now if i go back to our script.js then button here's what's going to happen guys we're going to get our current stream you see this my video stream we're going to get our current stream which is this one right here right this is the one we got just in general and and then we're going to get the audio tracks for that stream the first audio track is going to be my track and i'm going to get the current enabled version of that audio track and what happens if it's enabled i'm going to disable it you see this and if it's disabled i'm going to enable it right this is how this is the ap how the api allows us to do this so and then what's going to happen is we're going to set them unmute and mute button so what does this does check this out so if i i'm going to literally just going to copy and paste this pretty quickly okay really quickly here boom so when we when we want to go ahead and when we want to go ahead and unmute it right we want to go ahead and set the mute to false we want to kind of unmute it right there we want to now change the text to be on mute and we want to change the microphone to be microphone slash with the unmute class okay and then we do document the query selector to go ahead and you know uh to change the inner html of the main mute button right but again this main mute button is not going to work yet why is this not going to work drop it in the comments below why is it not going to work reason why is because when we try to change the inner html of this here it's not there so if we do command c main mute button if we go to room.ejs you can see that we only have you know this is main controls button so we need to do oh sorry my bad we need to add main mute button to here right same thing goes for yeah just the main button we need to add it to there so now if we go to script.js if we save this just like that okay if we save that you ready guys you ready to see if this works yes let's see refresh ready yeah let's go oh wait didn't work it did not work hold on dang it why did it not work so if i do console log if i do console enable of undefined and enable upon define so it looks like it does not see the enabled uh inside here video stream my video my video stream why isn't that working my video stream is here okay right we get the my video stream which is fine that's there which is fine my video stream that's fine stream my video stream equals stream we need to now simply check if it's enabled okay let's go ahead and do my video stream console log my video stream so i'm going to go ahead and on on click mute mute i'm going to console log this my video stream here's the video stream oh you know why here look because i disabled audio yeah that's why so it's like you're trying to get the audio tracks but your audio is disabled guys so that's why you see this but the reason why i disable the audio is because i simply you know because i have re i hear a reverb so if i do right there it's not even if if i do mute now hey look at that now it's muted guys you see that all right let's do it all right next up uh let's go ahead we need to change like that color so you can see when we do an unmute we have a special class for on mute so i can literally add that class if i go to style the css if i do dot unmute dot unmute the color for this specific unmute is just a red color okay and it's just simply like a red color looks like this all right so now if i save this if i re restart this okay so boom check this out boom boom boom guys drop it in the comments below give us some fire give us some uplifting you know some uplifting stuff because it's so good to be here with you all this is really amazing this is amazing guys so let's go back to now script.gs and we can really we can remove that console local we don't need this anymore let's look at now stop video ready stop video so all right let's go so with the stop video how about you go ahead and explain the stop video uh really quickly here stop video okay so uh where are we here okay so we it's it's pr it's almost the same so let me we need to create here okay i'll paste it okay so here is it here it is okay let's paste it let me for my document okay so so we we create a function called play stop so play or stop the video uh here it's me debugging so let's remove it so it's almost the same so if enabled so if there is a video just make it false and set play video we will see it in a bit and else if it's not enabled make it enable so this is only the two uh two um cases so now we need to to create stop video and play video functions so i'm gonna paste it here so as you can see here so let's remove this okay so set stop video it's a function which take html template string we we add a font here which is the regular font and stop video so nothing special here but here it's like the set set play video where we want to stop the video with nikon slash and play the video so all we need to do is go to the uh room dot ejs room dot ejs and call not in where we were stop video here before the class here we call on click here on click play stop okay so i'm going to call that function okay yeah we call the function when we write so now can you go to the save and go to the oh save that so i'm gonna save this okay save this yeah enable autosave bro uh i think we didn't he didn't you didn't save script.js i think oh yeah yeah thank you there you go save that beautiful refresh it okay all right hope it works can you can you press again here press again and stop video again okay oh no no in the html proper inner smell no where is so uh cc oh you know why do you know why check this out you see this main video button guys do you guys know why i dropped in the comments below if you know what i'm talking about it's because of the because it's trying to get an html of no and the reason why is because it cannot find this document that query selector so look if we do main video button if i copy this if i go to room.egs it's not here look i need to add that class into here you see yes there we go so now if you go ahead and save this if we go ahead and refresh this you guys ready for this ready for this yes um yes let's do it let's go look at that now we do play video stop video um just add this the glass to the yeah add the class to the stuff yeah so if we do stop all right save this ready look at that it works guys this is insane insane stuff guys yousef awesome job yes bro high five yo high five there we go guys guys give us a high five in the comments below guys look at what we've just done we've created a chat app it works the way it should you it works blah blah blah look at that this is insane stuff so what's the last thing we got to do yusuf now it's the easiest the easiest one for for you not for you for for the audience but the hardest one for us for yes exactly so guys are you ready are you ready to deploy this app yes i hope so you guys ready to play this app let's do it do it now guys before we continue on let's kind of i'm going to ask you guys smash that like button if you have not smashed that like button before as you can see we have worked really hard to provide this for you to create this application and to now teach you we have been at this what for now what three hours now guys and so we'd appreciate it guys let's go smash that like button subscribe to this youtube channel all right share this video if you can and if you're interested in a masterclass the link is down below but wait you will also have a profitable javascript course which is also really amazing if i can really quickly quick really quickly here show you

teach you react gs all that's in there right we have a course with 50 modules of training javascript success coaches right right here javascript success coaches right here we have we teach also how to make a living with javascript which is a very important part right not only do you get to learn programming but you also get to learn how to make a living and actually make money from it like if that sounds amazing let me know in the comments below right on top of that we have weekly coaching calls so beefy coaching was people like me yeah sunny kazi right we have an amazing community of at this point 1500 developers which is insane and everybody is there to help each other out and we have an amazing facebook community guys so if you're interested in that we have the link is in bio in there as well but if not there's we also have a free master class link in the bio link in description as well so take a look at it if you don't want to complete that's pretty fine but just want to let you know guys other than that let's deploy this you ready let's do it let's do it bro okay actually you have to you have you actually have to guide me through this one because you did this you did this part so let's let's go ahead and do this so what is the first thing we need to do bro so we are going to uh deploy our app using heroku okay uh the first thing we need to do is to install heroku globally so you can go to either do npm install g heroku frankie's like yo let's go frank yes you guys killed it thank you islam thank you great job guys thank you so much thank you guys this is amazing this is dope dude college life solution thank you thank you high five yes high five all right let's continue on let's put so the first thing what do you say i need to do okay either give me access to the your terminal over you right uh how about you just tell me what i need to do you just tell me what i need to type okay so uh mpm okay install right open the new terminal new terminal all right you guys can see me okay so npm okay so huh install install okay globally for global dash g dash okay yeah heroku all right ready okay all right do i need to do a git init do i need to initialize get here uh uh yeah yeah but it doesn't we can do it after right so install heroku so give us give us some time guys okay in the meantime i'm just gonna say you know uh look look through the comments guys we got vijay says good vibes nice work thanks so much man awesome stuff simple says thank you so much you guys are going to show us on github yes of course this is going to be on github guys of course bird's relax says like we are both going to rule the world developing world yes that's what we're here to do guys we're here to recognize the web development world okay all right love you too thank you as long as like thanks for shout out you got it oh man you guys are awesome you guys you guys are amazing man you guys are amazing thank you so much so much so much so much yes yes yes yes thank you so much thanks thanks okay all right so we got that what's next okay so uh let's do git init and let's push it do it happen at the same time get in it okay yeah and make sure to uh get in ignore and uh remove node modules oh yeah so new file do we need to do like do we need to actually do that yeah yeah because node module is do you guys know what git ignore is drop in the comments below if you guys know what git ignore is so we'll say node modules node underscore modules okay next okay uh so git add space dot dot okay next git commit commit dash jam this is gonna be our first commit right yep no i'm gonna say zoom clone down let's go horrible commander that's okay zoom command okay next uh wait wait wait wait we forget something don't forget to change the port oh yes let's go ahead and change the prop so one thing we realized guys is you need to change the port so if we go to script where is it script.js for this peer in order for this actually not not server.js script.js in order for our peer to peer to work we actually need to change the support to be what what uh i think 443 443 okay save that yeah it's four four three yeah i'm gonna do git add again git commit dash message and then at this point on i'm gonna say port good and then next okay so we did commit uh okay so now we can make uh so we we can push it to github but we can make uh the deployment from now so let's do it can we error or pushing the key tab let's just do a roku right away okay so type heroku create guys this is insane oh and val credential's provided please press any key to open any key so yes oh i need to log in okay guys i'm gonna log in here just you guys can see what i'm doing but i'm just logging in here real quickly here oh i'm logged in like that fast yeah that's so so insane insane okay next up so create oh just already created the app okay next okay next wait wait wait wait wait one sec so guitar okay then git push heroku master kit push heroku are you guys ready master oh we've got the process.env remember oh this won't work but but i think uh no problem i think no problem are you sure but yeah i don't think so because if we have four four three and then the process in v is four three it will work hope okay i'll see if you think it will work i guess we'll see okay next okay people are like please add process in vita port yes we need to add that let's do it cause i don't wanna i don't want to fail again so for the server that listen guys we actually have to specify this the port of the server itself so we're going to say process dot what dot nv right dot port right or or 30 30. so this one is going to be correct this one this one's gonna work when you are on the actual heroku server okay this is the default one that we use okay so let's go ahead and save this let's do git add again anything else yeah i think we're good then now could add git commit commit dash m m i'm gonna say okay port again okay beautiful that's so good then now we push the hook again he uh you did get uh there right yes it did yes yeah now git push uh heroku mars get push roll cool fast like this yeah i like the previous one holy moly guys look at how fast this is going oh that's insane mmhmm all right now we need to do heroku scale so we need to actually make sure that there's one instant that's running correct like this yep boom all right then what now heruko space open guys ready for this [Laughter] ready for this yes hold on look at this huh wait allow hey let's go that's working okay you guys ready for this now okay so now i i'm going to send this to i'm going to send this now to guys hold on it's insane just so you know guys insane stuff so this is actually now live it's a heroku it's a live heroku app which is just crazy
