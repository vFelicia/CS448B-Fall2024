00:04 - whoa hey guys how's it going alright
00:15 - guys welcome to this live broadcast with
00:19 - Kazi from clever programmer and in this
00:23 - video we're gonna talk a little bit
00:25 - about how you can go and become a Python
00:27 - developer in months and not yours so
00:32 - let's jump right into it alright so guys
00:38 - unbelievable unbelievabl so yeah we're
00:41 - gonna discuss all of those things in
00:42 - this video okay but I just got to kind
00:46 - of talk about this for the first time in
00:50 - my life ever my computer is just not
00:55 - working so I got to my office that's
00:58 - where I am right now you got to my
00:59 - office literally like turning on my
01:03 - computer and it just shuts off so the
01:08 - broadcast starts at 4:00 and then that's
01:10 - why I came on a few minutes later so I'm
01:12 - doing this from my phone right now
01:13 - hopefully it's working well from the
01:17 - phone how is it looking on your guyses
01:20 - and I know Austin I know sorry man
01:27 - Eid Mubarak sweet okay if anybody is
01:32 - having trouble kind of let me know but

01:36 - alright looks good beautiful alright
01:41 - guys so yeah you know I want to kind of
01:45 - cover a lot of things in this one but I
01:48 - just want to go through most of the
01:50 - things step-by-step let me make it a
01:53 - little bit better
01:57 - hopefully my phone won't fall I like to
02:00 - set it up on my tripod and then it's
02:02 - just like hanging on by the thread
02:07 - alright so in this one I'm gonna be
02:09 - taking some of your guys's questions as
02:11 - you guys know my create apps with Python
02:14 - or Python opie create apps course has
02:17 - finally launched so what I do is I take
02:21 - a cohort of students who joined then we
02:24 - run through a few months one two three
02:27 - months or maybe even more and then we go
02:31 - through that course together it's not
02:33 - live it's recorded right so when you get
02:35 - it you actually have lifetime access to
02:36 - it and then I launch it again
02:40 - so right now my course is open and it
02:42 - closes on June 30th so in three four
02:48 - days from now now in the last few videos
02:54 - I've talked a little bit about how much
02:57 - [Music]
02:59 - value there is in becoming a software
03:02 - developer right and kind of the job
03:04 - opportunity things of that nature so
03:06 - before I start let me ask you guys are
03:10 - you guys interested in becoming a
03:13 - software developer and why I kind of
03:15 - want to hear your reasons why you're
03:18 - looking into becoming a programmer so
03:21 - let me know below and I kind of want to
03:23 - see that HUD nice
03:32 - but this is kind of cool you know cuz I
03:34 - can just hold this up show you guys a
03:37 - little bit about my office here okay so
03:43 - a jack says freelance what else because
03:48 - I love being creative whatever is in my
03:51 - mind I want to create mobile apps always
03:54 - interested in programming my job ends on
03:56 - ah Tom Lynch I remember you man that's
04:01 - awesome I mean I don't know if that's
04:03 - awesome you said your job ends in seven
04:05 - freelance for one for fun I want to give
04:08 - it a try okay so I'm gonna parole I'm
04:13 - gonna probe a little bit further and a
04:16 - little bit deeper okay so I got a lot of
04:22 - things like I want to do I want to be
04:24 - creative I want to just try out
04:27 - something new so by programming why not
04:30 - literally anything else why not computer
04:32 - networking I love the fact that saw
04:40 - really based on imagination Python for
04:42 - web development bring your ideas to life
04:45 - okay those are really cool reasons Cody
04:48 - Cody just joined our course recently
04:54 - okay
04:55 - so a lot of you guys are saying that you
04:58 - want to do this because one let me get
05:02 - this right you like the challenge too
05:05 - because you can take what's in here make
05:08 - it a reality
05:10 - three how about this one doing something
05:14 - you know when you create a solution or
05:16 - you solve a problem all of a sudden it
05:18 - can be scaled instantly to millions of
05:21 - people does that kind of sound important
05:35 - hell yeah yeah so you know that's
05:39 - exactly you know one of their I'll tell
05:42 - you one of my reasons was because I did
05:45 - computer networking and kind of hated it
05:48 - oh my god like I was going to college
05:51 - and my brother was my brother was like
05:55 - hey why don't you do something so you're
05:57 - ahead of other people so while I was
05:59 - going to college I thought I don't want
06:01 - to just um you know not do anything or
06:05 - kind of figure out life by default this
06:07 - is something I talk about a lot right
06:08 - like you guys know how sloths survive so
06:13 - let me tell you how slots survive
06:15 - they're so slow right they're so slow
06:19 - they are weak they just drag along
06:25 - everywhere so how in the world have this
06:27 - survived till now how is that a
06:29 - possibility one very interesting thing
06:33 - is that sloths live on branches okay
06:39 - they live on like trees but like on top
06:42 - of it and they just kind of hold on to a
06:44 - branch and they live there now the thing
06:48 - about them is that they don't really
06:49 - take in a lot of they don't need a lot
06:52 - of food and stuff because they don't
06:53 - spend that much energy so because
06:55 - they're just literally chillin Netflix
06:57 - and chilling pretty much the entire time
06:59 - - the Netflix and they just kind of you
07:04 - know that's how they survive they need
07:08 - to eat very less now the animals that
07:09 - are at the top that can actually get to
07:12 - them are not really interested in eating
07:14 - them because those animals are usually
07:16 - smaller the animals at the bottom which
07:20 - are really giant really huge and can
07:22 - then come at the top and then out but
07:24 - the problem is that when they try to get
07:26 - to where the slots are they end up
07:28 - breaking those branches right those
07:32 - branches end up breaking and they end up
07:34 - falling so they can't eat them and so
07:38 - when I found this out first of all I
07:40 - thought it was really cool I thought oh
07:41 - my god you know that's pretty weird but
07:44 - you know that's how salons actually
07:46 - survive and live up to 20 or
07:47 - thirty years and then I was thinking
07:51 - holy
07:53 - slots survived by just existing like
08:01 - they literally survived by just existing
08:04 - the service survived by default okay so
08:11 - to relate it back to when I was kind of
08:14 - going in college I didn't wanna survive
08:17 - by just existing which was any job
08:22 - opportunity that comes my way I kind of
08:23 - accept it any any literally any upper -
08:29 - like any college that comes your way you
08:31 - kind of accepted any first job
08:32 - opportunity comes your way you accept it
08:34 - and a lot of the times you even accept
08:37 - working 9 to 5 doing lots of tedious
08:40 - soul-crushing paper shuffling kind of
08:44 - work and you find out they it's like
08:49 - thirty years that you've been doing this
08:51 - and then you kind of just spent your
08:52 - whole life like my uncle he was half a
08:57 - year from retiring he worked for this
08:59 - company for 29 years and he was gonna
09:01 - get started getting a pension and
09:03 - everything from them and then what
09:04 - happened was he got sick and he couldn't
09:09 - work so he had to quit and no pension
09:12 - for him and he literally has to survive
09:15 - off of whatever little money that he's
09:17 - gonna start getting in Social Security
09:19 - income and then he has like four kids
09:21 - that kind of have to survive off of that
09:23 - so for me I personally saw a lot of that
09:29 - and a lot of just kind of like people
09:33 - have this helplessness that happens a
09:35 - lot of the times whether it's you don't
09:39 - have enough money or whether you're
09:41 - doing something that makes you miserable
09:43 - those all kind of make you helpless and
09:47 - that's why I wanted to just pick
09:50 - something that allowed me to enjoy but
09:53 - then also earn a living that I can
09:56 - support not only myself but other people
09:59 - around me
10:02 - so I thought okay that's gonna be
10:04 - computer not working for me and then I
10:06 - joined computer networking and I wanted
10:07 - to kill myself in computer networking
10:09 - but then I joined but then I started
10:12 - doing computer programming I found out
10:14 - about it what I'm you know my oldest
10:16 - brother called me and he's like hey have
10:18 - you ever looked into this thing and I
10:20 - said no but I'm gonna check it out and
10:21 - then I started looking into it and I
10:23 - said hole the crap what is this this is
10:29 - the most amazing thing because I can
10:30 - take literally what's in my brain and
10:32 - turn it into a reality right like make
10:35 - it a real thing that people can use so
10:38 - you can do the same thing you can put
10:40 - something that you made online that
10:42 - people can use play around with and it's
10:44 - literally like they're playing around
10:46 - with the ideas that you have in your
10:47 - head but in reality and then that's how
10:51 - I kind of got started on this path but
10:54 - I'm not now I want to talk to you about
10:56 - you know this industry is where kind of
10:58 - the world is heading so first of all
11:00 - it's fun it almost feels like a glitch
11:03 - when somebody pays you to code because
11:05 - you're thinking it's literally something
11:10 - that I do for fun and I'm getting paid
11:13 - for it imagine like you watch Game of
11:14 - Thrones and you get paid for it or
11:16 - you're sitting there watching house of
11:18 - cards and you get paid for it imagine
11:20 - going for you know like I don't know
11:24 - going for this is the only thing that's
11:26 - coming to my mind because I did that a
11:28 - few months ago like jumping off of a
11:30 - plane and having fun enjoying your life
11:33 - or going to Six Flags and then somebody
11:35 - pays you for it so literally that's kind
11:38 - of how it was for me and I was able to
11:42 - get to the level where I was getting
11:44 - paid to code in less than three months
11:46 - and I got a lot a lot a lot a lot of you
11:49 - know I when I make a video like that or
11:51 - I even have a video I get so many people
11:55 - just hatin and write and writing on me
11:57 - basically and there's going you can't do
12:00 - this in three months and start getting
12:02 - paid it takes 25 years and so the reason
12:08 - why I started this clever programmer
12:09 - channel was kind of to debunk that myth
12:13 - mmm i feii in dedup you know this was
12:17 - something that I ended up discovering
12:19 - and I was like okay this is not that
12:20 - hard you don't need to be some kind of
12:22 - math genius you don't need to be some
12:26 - kind of like prodigy to learn computer
12:29 - programming
12:30 - it doesn't matter kind of how old you
12:33 - are because I know people who are 60
12:34 - years old who started and then they
12:38 - ended up getting a career in this but
12:41 - now one of my goals was okay I want to
12:44 - start a career in this fast and once I
12:47 - kind of did that this is something that
12:48 - I wanted to share with other people how
12:50 - can you then start your own career just
12:55 - rolling and then doing this faster and
12:57 - here are a few things that I'm gonna
12:59 - tell you that will help you so if you're
13:01 - watching this right now you know just
13:04 - close your other tabs if you have chrome
13:08 - and everything you know just close all
13:10 - of them out
13:10 - I can't just want you and I it just be
13:13 - one-on-one here for a second okay you
13:16 - know put your phone on Do Not Disturb
13:18 - and just relax get some popcorn get a
13:23 - legal pad this is what I use a lot just
13:28 - really helps me you know I write down my
13:30 - ideas here and that's how when I'm
13:32 - coding that's how I solve problems as
13:34 - well like I literally write them down by
13:37 - hand and that just it really helps me
13:43 - like putting things on paper so that's
13:46 - what I would suggest because I'm gonna
13:48 - give you some really valuable resources
13:50 - that will save you I don't know ten to
13:53 - hundreds of thousands of dollars and
13:54 - this is not a joke there are and those
13:57 - resources are free and then I also want
14:00 - to share with you some ways of how you
14:02 - can improve your coding skills you know
14:05 - so here's one of them really really
14:08 - important things that you should do okay
14:11 - schools hate them that's hilarious yet
14:13 - they do here's one of the really
14:16 - important things so somebody just asked
14:18 - me how do you start as a beginner I'm
14:19 - gonna tell you right now one of I will
14:24 - guide you okay one of the main
14:27 - you should focus on is play if you're
14:32 - learning and you wanna be you want to
14:34 - improve really fast focus on improving
14:38 - your focus on improving the time you
14:42 - spend playing with it okay so whatever
14:45 - skill it is that you're trying to get
14:46 - focus on just playing then learn later
14:49 - so if there was a 80/20 right something
14:52 - that there's like an 80 up here and a 20
14:55 - up here something that you spent short
14:56 - amount of time on something you spent a
14:58 - lot of time on a lot of people will tell
15:00 - you watch you know a video on udemy and
15:05 - Coursera just like learn and then don't
15:07 - do anything else what you should be
15:10 - doing is spending most of the time not
15:12 - learning theory but most of the time
15:15 - should be spent actually playing so 80%
15:17 - of the time should be actually spent
15:18 - playing and 20% of your time should
15:21 - actually be spent really learning the
15:24 - theory behind things okay so if it's
15:27 - computer programming for you this is
15:30 - what I would suggest and I won't even go
15:31 - further than that and I want to say it's
15:34 - almost like eighty ten or eighty fifteen
15:38 - five okay that gets really complicated
15:40 - but play build learn so most of your
15:43 - time should be spent playing then the
15:45 - rest of your time should be spend
15:47 - building and then the rest of your time
15:49 - should be spent learning and the reason
15:51 - why that's important is because first of
15:54 - all you associate fun and enjoyment with
15:57 - that skill so if it's you want to become
15:59 - a programmer right and you don't want to
16:01 - spend years literally years and years
16:04 - trying to become a programmer and start
16:08 - enjoying what you're doing and that
16:10 - happens a lot of the times by playing
16:12 - with that making it kind of natural for
16:14 - you then use that to build stuff okay
16:19 - and then once you start using it to
16:21 - build stuff now you have stuff to show
16:23 - for what you did because that's
16:24 - practical like you and I were busy we
16:27 - don't have all the time in the world to
16:30 - focus on one thing and then just do it
16:32 - for 20 hours a day you want to spend
16:34 - your time and get the most out of it
16:36 - right so when you play and you build now
16:39 - you have something to
16:40 - over it even on your portfolios when
16:42 - you're going to get clients for Python
16:44 - and doing freelancing or if you want to
16:46 - even apply the software developer you're
16:48 - building a portfolio as you are going
16:51 - okay and then you have although at the
16:56 - bottom you have learning so you want to
16:59 - kind of do the learning part and you
17:02 - want to and actually shorten that a
17:04 - little bit so you want to spend less
17:05 - time learning and more time building
17:08 - things with it getting done I'm a
17:13 - huge proponent of doing things rather
17:15 - than just passively sitting there and
17:17 - learning because what happens is that it
17:19 - doesn't become a part of you and you
17:21 - also don't have anything to show for it
17:23 - because a lot of the times what would
17:24 - happen to me is I'd be taking these
17:25 - courses on and you can write these
17:27 - resources down because they're all free
17:29 - and very valuable
17:31 - udemy okay so if anybody knows the
17:34 - spellings of these please put it in chat
17:36 - code Academy team treehouse Udacity
17:45 - Coursera and edex okay and all of these
17:52 - guys have you know PhDs from UC Berkeley
17:57 - and people who are working for Google
17:59 - and people whatever and they're teaching
18:01 - you and most of them are free so you can
18:04 - actually pick up those technical skills
18:06 - from right there but a lot of the times
18:08 - what happens is I'd be taking these
18:10 - courses and would be working on really
18:11 - esoteric things like a for example
18:13 - recursive Fibonacci solution or we'll be
18:17 - working on you know using the Fibonacci
18:19 - to make this like circle get the area
18:22 - under the curve using Python and this
18:26 - stuff improved my coding skills but at
18:30 - the end of the day when I got done I
18:32 - didn't have anything to show for it
18:35 - I didn't have anything that I could take
18:37 - to my clients and I don't want that to
18:38 - happen for you guys because that's how
18:41 - you end up spending years and you don't
18:44 - have anything to show for it at the end
18:45 - of the day like when I was actually
18:49 - starting out one of my friends got a job
18:51 - before I did because I focused so much
18:53 - on the theory
18:54 - stuff he focused more on just building
18:56 - web apps and things and he knew less
18:58 - than I did he was way less skilled than
19:00 - I am and he ended up getting a job
19:02 - faster than I did he started getting
19:04 - consulting work and freelancing work
19:06 - faster than I did because all of the
19:10 - things that he was learning he was
19:11 - building and then when he went to apply
19:13 - he had stuff to show for it he even had
19:16 - recruiters find his stuff on websites
19:19 - like github
19:21 - they found his activities that he was
19:23 - kind of doing on meetup.com and wherever
19:25 - like he was going to all these groups
19:26 - they're like you know what we're gonna
19:28 - hire this person because there are
19:30 - actual projects that this guy has write
19:33 - actual work so that's what I would tell
19:36 - you to focus on so if you're debating
19:38 - between taking a course from one of
19:40 - these websites and you're trying to
19:42 - think about them right
19:44 - which website should I take a course
19:47 - from where should I go first of all make
19:49 - sure that the instructor is the right
19:50 - fit for you and then make sure that what
19:54 - you're learning isn't so theoretical in
19:56 - a satirical oh I love you too you say
19:59 - you love me from Egypt I love you from
20:01 - Chicago I'm in Chicago right now so
20:05 - basically that's you know one of the
20:07 - things when you build those things you
20:09 - build projects somebody asked me what do
20:10 - you build well when you're okay for
20:13 - example I'll give you an example instead
20:15 - of doing a recursive Fibonacci solution
20:17 - work on building a tic-tac-toe game I'll
20:21 - get a lot of hate from developers on
20:23 - this but you know there is a time and
20:26 - place for doing those like recursive
20:28 - Fibonacci solution and like complicated
20:30 - things with data structures there is a
20:31 - time in place but what I want to focus
20:34 - on with you is practical stuff that gets
20:36 - you started because look you don't have
20:39 - so much time some of you guys maybe 20
20:41 - 30 40 years old some of you guys maybe
20:44 - have a family some of you guys already
20:46 - have a job you don't have time to learn
20:49 - all this other crap which is beautiful
20:51 - it's a lot of fun but you don't have all
20:53 - this time to learn it so what I want you
20:56 - to focus on instead is focus on things
20:58 - that build a portfolio for you
21:00 - so you can start working and once you
21:02 - start earning an income then all of a
21:05 - sudden you have time for it you
21:07 - you're working in IT field right now and
21:09 - you start earning an income from Python
21:11 - you can go you know what I can start
21:15 - dropping some of my work I can put it a
21:17 - few hours into the site each job and
21:19 - more hours into Python all of a sudden
21:20 - you're learning faster what should have
21:22 - taken you years is now taking you months
21:24 - then you could go even further and just
21:27 - say okay I don't want to do IT at all
21:31 - and just switch over to Python and you
21:34 - can do that as well because those things
21:38 - are really important like how do I make
21:42 - that career switch how do I go from my
21:45 - current job to Python development and
21:47 - that was another one of those things I
21:49 - didn't see some anybody explain which
21:52 - was okay great they're all this course
21:54 - covers really technical stuff and I'm
21:56 - picking up lots of technical skills but
21:58 - how do I go from my current job to
22:01 - becoming a software developer how do I
22:05 - go from what I'm currently doing to
22:07 - doing programming or sorry doing
22:10 - programming and kind of getting paid for
22:12 - it because I want to be doing real
22:14 - practical stuff how do I go on to build
22:16 - a portfolio how do I know I'm ready to
22:21 - start freelancing how do I know I'm
22:24 - ready to apply for a job how do I know
22:29 - where do I go to find clients how do I
22:32 - know how to keep those clients what do I
22:36 - say when I'm about to lose a client you
22:40 - know and most of these courses aren't
22:43 - even like teaching a lot of the times a
22:45 - project-based way of learning but those
22:47 - that do those are really really really
22:49 - really helpful some of the courses that
22:51 - have helped me and you guys could write
22:53 - it down and you guys actually could go
22:54 - take these courses or free intro to
22:57 - computer science course on Udacity write
22:59 - it down don't open that tab and go to it
23:01 - yet you can always go to it later but
23:03 - this is important then you have courses
23:06 - on Coursera and it's called intro to
23:11 - interactive programming and Python on
23:13 - freaking believable course and it's
23:16 - actually free of cost the drawback of
23:20 - those courses
23:21 - they don't teach you how you convert to
23:24 - actually making money how do you even
23:26 - the projects that you built
23:28 - put it on your portfolio and all that
23:29 - but the great thing is that the course
23:32 - has a lot of great valuable information
23:34 - in there so if you want to improve your
23:36 - technical skills great place to go to
23:39 - again this is another one of those
23:41 - reasons why I created my create apps
23:44 - with Python course so first of all I
23:46 - already have you know like about 150
23:51 - videos on YouTube and I have my free
23:55 - course which is called learn Python but
23:58 - the point of my new course which is
23:59 - called create absolute Python or Python
24:02 - olp create apps is literally how do you
24:05 - go from knowing nothing to learning
24:09 - Python while building a portfolio while
24:14 - trying to earn an income as you learn
24:16 - because that's what I found the secret
24:19 - was between the people who took years to
24:22 - learn programming versus months for me
24:26 - it took me months like one to two months
24:28 - and I was getting paid to code that's
24:30 - why so many people can wrap their mind
24:33 - around it because then what I was able
24:34 - to do is just completely drop the other
24:37 - thing that I was doing is focused on
24:39 - software development and then that
24:42 - allowed me to be in a position where and
24:44 - it will allow it can allow you as well
24:46 - to be in a position where you can choose
24:48 - to work for somebody or not you can
24:50 - choose to hire or fire a client you can
24:53 - choose to kind of work on your own hours
24:56 - and then it's fun like when you're
24:58 - actually working as well those are one
25:00 - those are a few of the things that I
25:01 - really liked and I saw that you guys
25:03 - kind of like that as well so that's what
25:07 - I would suggest you know if you're gonna
25:09 - take those online courses from the
25:12 - websites that I've mentioned above make
25:13 - sure that they're project-based and they
25:16 - have something on your portfolio so when
25:18 - you walk in you don't look like an idiot
25:20 - okay and again if you're ready to make
25:23 - that leap that is again one of the
25:25 - reasons why I made this course teaching
25:29 - you programming skills along with all of
25:32 - the skills that go along with it
25:34 - this is something I explained earlier
25:37 - being good at interview or being good at
25:40 - getting jobs is different than being
25:42 - good being a good software developer
25:45 - they're two different things and the
25:48 - example I always give is in my high
25:51 - school I was like almost certified
25:54 - dumped I got a really really low score
25:57 - on my AC T which is a standardized test
25:59 - they use in the United States to figure
26:00 - out how intelligent you are basically
26:03 - and I got a really low score on that but
26:07 - at the same time I was top 1% in the
26:10 - world for chess and still am so how can
26:13 - somebody be top 1% in chess and kind of
26:17 - know a few things but then get such a
26:18 - low score on a CT that they are actually
26:23 - like they're almost certified dumb like
26:25 - I wouldn't tell anybody I was so
26:27 - embarrassed and I'm actually sharing
26:28 - this now and what I ended up finding out
26:33 - was it's not about how smart yours about
26:34 - how good you are taking that test so
26:37 - it's not really capturing your
26:39 - intelligence it's really focusing on
26:41 - improving those testing skills those
26:44 - tests taking specific skills so now
26:47 - let's go back to computer programming
26:48 - and software development getting good at
26:53 - interviews is very different getting a
26:55 - job and having a good portfolio that
26:58 - lands you clients gets people to work
27:00 - with you is very different from being a
27:03 - good programmer I myself don't have 20
27:09 - years of experience programming but I
27:11 - charge my clients like 10 times more
27:14 - than some of my mentors I was working
27:16 - with when I was starting out and they're
27:18 - rock star programmers who've been
27:20 - freaking working their ass off since
27:22 - they were 5 years old and they're just
27:25 - like they know everything inside and out
27:27 - about programming they can probably
27:29 - program better than they can actually
27:32 - even walk or talk literally and then it
27:37 - you know so there are two completely
27:41 - different things so again that's what I
27:44 - want to focus on for you that's my goal
27:46 - for you for
27:47 - you to be able to make that transition
27:49 - from whatever you're currently doing
27:50 - from whatever your current job is to
27:53 - making that switch as fast as possible
27:56 - to the programming field to the software
27:58 - development field from going from
28:01 - scratch being able to create apps and
28:03 - then being able to actually get clients
28:06 - from it okay so if you guys are
28:09 - interested in my course or you want to
28:12 - learn just learn more about it and see
28:13 - what it's about the link is right below
28:16 - or it should be if it isn't I don't know
28:22 - what I'll have to do because I'm on my
28:24 - phone and I can't really do anything my
28:27 - computer isn't coming on so it is what
28:30 - it is but my course should be in the
28:32 - links below can you see can somebody
28:33 - tell me if it is it is right okay
28:36 - beautiful oh my name is Rafa Kazi
28:38 - kuber's okay so I'm gonna start taking
28:44 - questions from you guys now but yeah if
28:49 - you guys are interested in course you
28:50 - want to find out more about it literally
28:52 - clink click the link below right now I
28:54 - stand behind my courses so much first of
28:57 - all you know they they give you
28:59 - tremendous value and hands down these
29:01 - are the best courses out there the
29:03 - reason why I know is because I've taken
29:05 - literally every course and like for
29:08 - certifications from Coursera I have like
29:10 - three certifications from EDX I have
29:12 - taken the courses on Udacity like four
29:15 - of them team treehouse code Academy
29:18 - pretty much everywhere and then I what I
29:21 - didn't find from there is what this
29:23 - course is about but you know again I
29:27 - stand behind him so much that before I
29:29 - was doing a 30 day money you know money
29:31 - back now you're not happy for any reason
29:33 - I'm gonna give you 60 days on it so for
29:37 - any freakin reason you don't like it
29:39 - cause II your jokes are not funny
29:40 - anymore or you're looking ugly and I
29:42 - want to return it like sure no problem
29:44 - no questions asked alright now I'm gonna
29:46 - take your questions the link is below
29:48 - click that link in the mean times let's
29:50 - jump in to these questions and I'm gonna
29:53 - try to turn on my computer because it's
29:54 - really pissing me off gonna have to buy
29:59 - a new computer
30:01 - all right Neil Patel says what about you
30:04 - to me um I'm gonna have to write down
30:09 - these questions somewhere too because
30:10 - they're moving so fast okay so somebody
30:16 - asked what about you to me you to me is
30:19 - really good but it's made by a bunch of
30:23 - old people who that's what I think you
30:29 - know they were running a little tight on
30:31 - their budget and they're like crap we're
30:34 - gonna make a course so we can pay the
30:36 - bills for June and they're like behind a
30:41 - PowerPoint behind a slide that has zero
30:43 - passion they're not interested in what
30:45 - they're teaching you that's one of my
30:48 - biggest problems with a udemy if you can
30:50 - get something from Udacity go there
30:53 - first like if you're looking between
30:54 - those academic resources and you don't
30:58 - really care about making money from
31:00 - Python then go to Hey Bruce how's it
31:04 - going then go to Udacity always go to
31:07 - Udacity first then go other places udemy
31:10 - sucks like most people are young you to
31:12 - me because they always have a 90 I know
31:14 - this because I take so many questions
31:16 - from you to me and it's always like oh
31:18 - they have a 95% promotion sale going on
31:21 - so I'm just gonna buy 30 courses that
31:23 - I'm never gonna take so that's really
31:25 - what it is yeah I want to shoot myself a
31:28 - lot of the times when I'm going on you
31:30 - to me there's no production quality they
31:32 - make it in like one sitting on a
31:34 - Wednesday there's like it just pisses me
31:37 - off because there's no love for this
31:39 - like let me show you okay how much love
31:42 - I have for this monster monster okay I
31:49 - have my frickin office over here I spend
31:53 - all my time making these courses for you
31:55 - guys like I'm a psychopath like I love
32:00 - it so much and it's built with so much
32:01 - passion you know I hire crews I have to
32:05 - software develop I have software
32:06 - developers working for me
32:08 - I have marketing development
32:09 - representatives I have business
32:11 - consultants I have video editors
32:13 - and then I work with them and we work
32:16 - together to make sure that we give you
32:18 - the highest quality and the best
32:19 - material possible it again it all
32:21 - started from just me zero people's your
32:24 - subscribers just a few months ago seven
32:27 - eight months ago and this is my passion
32:30 - this is what I love to teach this is
32:31 - what I love to do this is what I'm about
32:33 - you know this is not oh I want to make
32:35 - some extra cash money and let me make
32:38 - one course over the weekend put it on
32:40 - you to me because they'll market it for
32:41 - me and yeah hopefully there'll be a 90
32:45 - percent sale and a bunch of people will
32:48 - buy it and cool we get to go to like
32:50 - Mexico and have a nice little vacation
32:51 - with our family know like I gave up my
32:55 - clients I gave up my software
32:57 - development jobs and I'd the reason why
33:00 - I did that so I can go and fight or
33:01 - flight mode and then just give it all
33:03 - I've got to bring clever programmer to
33:08 - the people to you guys and bring this
33:11 - message out and the word of software
33:14 - development how amazing it is out okay
33:17 - all right
33:21 - kuber's i'm mm not 1900
33:31 - what types of things go on your
33:33 - portfolio let's see you build a web app
33:35 - using simple frameworks with Python
33:37 - flask which in this course I'm actually
33:40 - going to show you I'm gonna have videos
33:41 - on flask as well in my course I go over
33:44 - where do you get clients how can you
33:47 - earn an income while learning Python
33:48 - this is one of the biggest secrets once
33:50 - I found this out it helped me make a
33:52 - switch to programming in months not
33:54 - years and once I found this out I helped
33:56 - my best friend quit his soul-crushing
34:00 - paper shuffling tedious job at CVS that
34:04 - he was doing from 9:00 to 5:00 making
34:06 - $13 an hour to making $75 an hour with
34:10 - the clients that he was working with and
34:12 - he was making about seven to eight
34:15 - thousand dollars a month doing computer
34:17 - programming software development in a
34:19 - few months so it is possible the reason
34:22 - why I don't like to always throw these
34:23 - numbers out people are like can you
34:25 - guarantee my success sorry Cody I'm
34:27 - gonna throw you under the bus here but I
34:30 - can only put the path for you they're
34:32 - like my oldest brother did for me like
34:34 - my coding mentors did for me I want to
34:36 - kind of return that favor but you do
34:38 - have to put in the effort when I started
34:40 - out I was putting in 20 hours a day
34:43 - my mentor would come at 7 p.m. and he
34:48 - would see me working at this co-working
34:50 - space and then he would help me and then
34:52 - he would leave at 9:00 p.m. he would go
34:54 - to sleep at 10 p.m. whatever he'd wake
34:57 - up he'd go to his job he'd come back and
35:00 - I was work he would come back and I
35:02 - would still be working there my eyes
35:04 - would be like red bloodshot and I'd be
35:05 - solving a coding problem or doing a
35:07 - coding challenge and then also what it
35:10 - made me realize was that's not practical
35:12 - for most of you guys that's impossible
35:14 - for most of you guys right that's not
35:18 - you know you guys have things going on
35:21 - and so how can I make this so you get
35:25 - the most practical stuff and it gets you
35:27 - results in the least amount of time I'm
35:29 - not saying the least amount of effort
35:30 - but the least amount of time gets you
35:33 - real results
35:41 - yeah so let's see yeah no that that's
35:51 - okay you know for how do you get high in
35:55 - code I don't get high
35:57 - that's okay if you this is this course
36:00 - is a serious investment and I understand
36:02 - that but it literally has material that
36:06 - can change your life and it took me
36:08 - months of time to make this into the
36:11 - best course possible I do have one
36:14 - hundred and sixty videos that are
36:16 - completely free of cost all over it on
36:18 - YouTube and then my learn Python course
36:20 - is also completely free with exercises
36:22 - quizzes and everything so if this is too
36:24 - expensive for you that is completely
36:26 - fine there are courses available that I
36:28 - have that you don't have to pay a penny
36:31 - for but if you're interested in this
36:33 - course which you should be if you're
36:34 - serious about this at least take a look
36:36 - into it
36:36 - the link is below and then decide for
36:39 - yourself whether this is an investment
36:40 - you want to make or not but this course
36:43 - does close this course closes on Friday
36:48 - June 30th and then it'll be probably
36:52 - many months before I launch it again so
36:55 - what I like to do is I get the students
36:57 - and then I want to focus on them I don't
36:58 - want to talk about this course
37:00 - I don't want to spend any time outside
37:04 - of working with the students for taking
37:06 - this course and then also any time any
37:08 - new videos get added any time any new
37:10 - live interviews if I do for this course
37:12 - get added or any bonus content that gets
37:15 - added if you have lifetime access to
37:17 - everything for free if you join this
37:20 - course so if the price increases for
37:22 - this course later on which it probably
37:24 - will because I keep adding so much stuff
37:26 - to this you'll have access to it for
37:30 - free of cost so you don't have to pay a
37:31 - single penny once new stuff gets added
37:34 - that's what happened to all the you know
37:36 - students who joined it the last time it
37:38 - launched it was way cheaper and every
37:45 - time anything got added it was free of
37:47 - cost
37:48 - so my the way this course is really done
37:51 - it's very simple I put money by focus on
37:54 - putting money back in your pocket most
37:56 - Python courses or most courses on
37:59 - programming teach you technical skills
38:01 - only and they don't focus on putting
38:04 - money in your pocket so you're not
38:06 - making anything mmm they just charge you
38:09 - what they charge you my course focus is
38:11 - on making sure to kind of put that back
38:13 - in your pocket all right I'm in a coding
38:16 - boot camp right now for a Java course is
38:18 - it a good idea to learn Python
38:19 - simultaneously should I learn statistics
38:21 - and R before I learn Python so I'm going
38:23 - to answer that question there are too
38:25 - many things going on and you need to
38:27 - just narrow down and focus on one thing
38:29 - so don't worry so much about languages
38:31 - worry about the concepts if you started
38:33 - with Java or R and you and it's been
38:37 - years you don't need to make that switch
38:39 - it doesn't make sense if you're just
38:42 - starting out languages don't matter the
38:44 - concepts do the reason why I mentioned
38:48 - Python and I'm a big proponent of Python
38:50 - and I preach Python and I say start with
38:54 - Python is because one it's the easiest
38:57 - to it's one of the most highly trending
38:59 - it just beat out Java in popularity last
39:02 - year and three it's one of the most
39:04 - highly paid it's literally up there with
39:07 - JavaScript and all those languages that
39:09 - get paid the most so and it's used in
39:14 - the biggest companies you can imagine
39:15 - Instagram Google YouTube it's probably
39:21 - even used at NASA for like doing data
39:23 - science stuff so from all the way web
39:25 - development to data science pythons got
39:27 - you covered
39:28 - it's like United autos insurance 7 7 3 2
39:31 - - you know what I mean so that's what it
39:32 - is I need some books to go hard here's a
39:37 - book it's called Python programming
39:41 - incredible book it's not my book I will
39:44 - probably write a book soon but get this
39:47 - really freaking good book unbelievable
39:51 - what do you recommend for a resources
39:52 - left oh god damn it oh I'm so sorry ok
40:00 - somebody did a super chat which is so
40:02 - cool this is the first time somebody did
40:04 - a super chat with me so this is actually
40:07 - really exciting he just paid $5 thank
40:09 - you so much I do apologize because I'm
40:12 - on a livestream on my phone and any
40:15 - message that comes up it just goes away
40:17 - and hides so unless I see it it kind of
40:20 - goes away so I try to write it down but
40:21 - I think you asked me something along the
40:24 - lines of what kind of book can I get
40:25 - after the livestream I'll try to find
40:27 - your message and reply back to you but
40:31 - what I will say is that this is a good
40:34 - resource really good resource to start
40:36 - off with focus on learning the concepts
40:39 - first and then you can switch to any
40:40 - programming ok so any language so for
40:45 - example if you pick up Python then you
40:47 - can switch to JavaScript you know in
40:51 - like two days not a big problem okay
40:54 - what do you recommend for resources
40:55 - slash books for people who want to learn
40:57 - Python to work in all finance
40:59 - electronics ok so again good book to get
41:02 - started off with I do have experience I
41:05 - have I also have lots of students were
41:06 - like PhDs and then going for their
41:08 - masters at UFC I have another student
41:11 - who's going she's going for her PhD at
41:15 - UFC and I was coaching her when I was
41:19 - like 19 years old so I've just been
41:22 - doing crazy stuff since like you know
41:26 - just I just go really hard when I jump
41:29 - into something and one of the things
41:31 - that you know for her she's trying to
41:35 - learn all these skills and still what I
41:37 - recommend for a lot of them is start
41:39 - with basics people who want to do
41:41 - complicated things will look into
41:42 - complicated things and they'll think
41:44 - there are past the basics and then their
41:45 - programming skills are absolute I'm
41:48 - sorry but that's what it is
41:50 - my students who are going to get their
41:53 - PhDs were way worse programmers and some
41:55 - of my students who didn't know anything
41:58 - about programming and they even thought
41:59 - they were dumb but they learned way
42:02 - better and they were much much much
42:03 - better
42:05 - you mean UFC somebody just said UFC UFC
42:10 - is awesome I love watching UFC one of my
42:13 - students also
42:14 - goes and does trading so for trading
42:16 - there are also frameworks and Python
42:18 - that you can use focus on becoming a
42:20 - better developer and then you can
42:22 - actually leverage these big frameworks
42:27 - for things like trading and you know
42:31 - basically you can use those frameworks
42:33 - then and you won't need to know any math
42:35 - or any crazy stuff behind them because
42:37 - they'll take care of it for you that's
42:40 - why I love software development the book
42:46 - name is somebody please write the book
42:48 - name for him but the book is called
42:49 - Python programming and introduction to
42:51 - computer science by John Zell and people
42:57 - who spend time buying things like this
42:59 - books like this somebody even in my
43:01 - slack channel was asking questions and I
43:03 - kind of got upset at him I shouldn't
43:05 - have but it's like three sodas guys but
43:09 - you're gonna spend this time oh my god
43:12 - Austen thank you so much somebody said
43:14 - they thought this is crazy it's like
43:15 - live streamers when they get money is
43:17 - just cool it's like five bucks one buck
43:19 - like you just bought me you know like
43:21 - whew a few more of these monsters thank
43:24 - you guys
43:24 - like this is what it takes for me to
43:26 - code for you and make those videos so
43:28 - the more you get any of these monsters
43:30 - the more training sessions you'll have
43:33 - there's some super chat option but
43:36 - seriously you should not be asking
43:40 - should I invest in getting this book
43:43 - like there's something wrong with you if
43:46 - that happens because this is worth like
43:48 - three sodas it's like 15 bucks maybe 10
43:51 - bucks
43:52 - so in knowledge invest first and then
43:55 - think later all and also all these
43:59 - always have a money-back guarantee so
44:00 - you get it and you don't like it you can
44:02 - literally read like half of it and then
44:05 - return it that's a cheap thing to do I
44:06 - don't recommend it I never do it but if
44:09 - that's what you're worried about
44:10 - spending that money which you were going
44:12 - to invest in probably sodas or I don't
44:15 - know HBO or Netflix subscription anyways
44:18 - or your extra phone bill like it's much
44:20 - better to spend it here yeah like don't
44:24 - be so hesitant of spending when it comes
44:26 - to knowledge
44:27 - and learning things like I'm so crazy I
44:30 - bought a $4,000 course I actually have a
44:33 - video on it and that course is called
44:36 - God zero to launch and it's a business
44:39 - course and it helped me take clever
44:41 - programmer to where it is right now from
44:44 - zero to well I can't give it all the I
44:48 - can't give it all of the credit because
44:51 - I work really hard but yes it's a four
44:54 - thousand dollar course go look it up
44:55 - it's called zero to launch I even have a
44:57 - video on actually buying it live and
45:00 - what I was thinking before making that
45:02 - purchase it's a 59 minute long video but
45:05 - even a few things that I got from it
45:07 - were just so incredible but you know
45:09 - there's a reason why clever programmer
45:11 - went from zero subscribers to over
45:13 - 55,000 subscribers in a few months you
45:17 - know and thanks to you guys because if
45:19 - you guys are not here there is no
45:20 - channel right it doesn't exist if you're
45:22 - not here literally right now sitting
45:24 - here watching this this channel doesn't
45:27 - exist so like I need you and that's
45:31 - what's like valuable for me and that
45:33 - course taught me how to connect better
45:35 - with you and help you out better and
45:37 - that's what I've been focusing on okay
45:39 - yeah and that's just one of the courses
45:42 - like I have so many freaking courses
45:43 - that are really really a you know
45:46 - expensive but when you think of the
45:48 - return on investment they're not that
45:49 - expensive because of the things that
45:51 - they teach you like for example let's
45:52 - say you paid thousand dollars for a
45:54 - course it teaches you how to get a
45:55 - client let's say you get three clients
45:57 - do you have these clients pay you $50 a
45:59 - month or sorry $50 an hour yes it my
46:04 - course does have a mastermind group okay
46:07 - anyways so let's say it pays you to pay
46:10 - you $50 an hour that's one hundred and
46:12 - fifty dollars if you have four sessions
46:14 - with them in just one month that's 150
46:18 - times four that's six hundred dollars in
46:20 - one month that's twelve hundred dollars
46:22 - in the next month you've paid off the
46:23 - thousand dollar course in just two
46:25 - months one of the students that clever
46:27 - programmer tried one of our strategies
46:29 - and in 72 hours she had booked three
46:33 - clients she went from thirteen dollars
46:36 - an hour to having three clients paying
46:39 - her $60 an hour
46:41 - and she was working full-time at a job
46:44 - that she hated and so this just kind of
46:46 - freed her up yeah they're launched it's
46:49 - really expensive course but if you're
46:52 - serious about business it's a pretty
46:54 - damn good course what kind of programs
46:58 - you recommend uh thank you guys I love
47:05 - the super chats coming in that's so
47:08 - crazy
47:09 - um okay is there any major difference
47:12 - between the videos I upload on YouTube
47:14 - and the course that's a really good
47:15 - question there absolutely is a ginormous
47:17 - difference I can't control how I put
47:19 - things on YouTube for example if I want
47:22 - to put a challenge for you there's no
47:23 - nice way for me to put it in the course
47:25 - if I want to lay it out in the best way
47:28 - possible I don't have control over that
47:30 - if I want to make a change to something
47:33 - I can't do that as well because things
47:35 - are kind of set in stone if I want to
47:38 - email you a specific video that's
47:40 - time-sensitive or there's like a
47:42 - specific opportunity that I think you
47:43 - should look into a reply I don't have a
47:46 - way of connecting with you from fate and
47:48 - YouTube so easily so when I'm on my when
47:52 - I'm in the when you get the course all
47:55 - of that stuff is in one place like for
47:58 - example I have hundred and seventy
47:59 - videos online right now and you could
48:02 - probably just look at them and learn a
48:04 - lot of things and then try to put the
48:06 - pieces together that's what I always did
48:08 - spend thousands of hours trying to put
48:10 - the pieces together like for example it
48:12 - took me two years to learn how to make a
48:13 - web app I can teach you in one hour I
48:15 - swear to god I've done this for so many
48:17 - of my students who took one-on-one
48:19 - lessons with me one hour I can teach you
48:21 - that or even less and that was something
48:24 - that took me two years alone because I
48:25 - never wanted to invest in myself and I
48:28 - just wanted to put the pieces together I
48:29 - want to take every free course and I did
48:31 - and there's nothing wrong with that but
48:34 - it just takes extra time so if you have
48:36 - extra time then um you can you know if
48:41 - you have extra time then you can watch
48:43 - the videos on YouTube and try to put it
48:46 - together but in the course it's in a
48:48 - nice linear structure step by step for
48:50 - you to follow so then you get this right
48:53 - stuff at the right time
48:54 - and then you get the most results so
48:56 - that's really what it is it's just
48:58 - packaged together perfectly for you
49:00 - saving you time saving you money okay so
49:03 - you don't have to get ten different
49:05 - courses this one course is you know kind
49:08 - of covers most of those things now once
49:10 - you start earning an income while you
49:13 - learn which is one of the key key key
49:15 - things I think then you can go and
49:18 - invest in more technical courses which
49:20 - is also something that I did because I
49:22 - got really technical courses what kind
49:24 - of programs you recommend to write for
49:26 - beginners programs that I recommend
49:30 - thank you for the super chat yeah that
49:32 - was really cool the programs I say that
49:35 - beginners should write and write this
49:36 - down
49:37 - tic-tac-toe great program to write write
49:40 - that down
49:40 - rock-paper-scissors in my free course I
49:43 - actually go over how to do
49:45 - rock-paper-scissors for completely free
49:46 - full project for you and you can take
49:49 - that course for free on my website on
49:51 - clever programmer calm that's another
49:55 - great thing to do some other ones that
49:58 - are fun to do is like basic web apps
50:00 - those are another ones that are fun
50:03 - programs that you can do or like a snake
50:05 - game where you're like a little snake
50:07 - going around and then you're collecting
50:09 - those little coins those help your
50:11 - skills and also show people you can
50:13 - build real world apps making them more
50:15 - likely to pay you to code for them how
50:19 - many money you invested through your
50:20 - programming learning days a lot what I
50:24 - would do is all the hourly income that I
50:27 - made from chess and I was even back back
50:29 - even and that day I was charging clients
50:31 - like $150 an hour to coach them in chess
50:34 - and all the money but now you know that
50:37 - happened like a little bit later like
50:39 - before even when I was making 50 or $35
50:41 - an hour coaching clients for chess what
50:46 - I would do is I don't think of my money
50:48 - as this one static thing I think of it
50:50 - as a very dynamic thing meaning I didn't
50:52 - think of it as money I just thought of
50:54 - it like I can use it to trade skills so
50:56 - for example all the money I made for
50:58 - chess I hired like first of all I
51:00 - invests it by getting online courses or
51:04 - you know books like these or hiring
51:07 - and tours and then working with them one
51:09 - on one side use my chest money to help
51:11 - me improve faster in programming it's
51:14 - not that I won't get there it just it
51:16 - takes you longer to connect the dots but
51:18 - when you have somebody who knows the
51:20 - ropes who knows where you are right now
51:22 - where you need to go who knows your
51:24 - weaknesses who can challenge in the
51:27 - right way that improves your speed by by
51:30 - years seriously so those were some of
51:32 - the things that helped me personally a
51:34 - lot and so I switched basically my I use
51:39 - my chest skills to become better in
51:41 - Python skills I'm sorry I'm missing your
51:47 - guys's question can you give a tip for
51:49 - teenagers I don't know about that Python
51:52 - or Java for first Python for first how
51:56 - easy is Python for someone who knows
51:58 - some Perl very easy could you explain
52:00 - the mindset between the definitions
52:02 - index that's very technical advantages
52:05 - of the mastermind group advantages of
52:09 - the mastermind group okay how many
52:15 - people are here okay so um yeah my so
52:28 - sorry guys what is this this is crazy we
52:30 - launched so many people okay hopefully
52:33 - you guys are coming back and
52:34 - reconnecting that kind of sucks this is
52:36 - so annoying my phone is not dead but the
52:38 - problem that happened yeah I'm alive the
52:41 - problem that happened is that it
52:42 - disconnected because of this Wi-Fi
52:46 - there's just like everything you know
52:48 - the first little computer died when I
52:50 - came in here and it's still dead and
52:53 - then the Wi-Fi died so I switched to LTE
52:58 - rip data so thank you guys for those
53:01 - super chats and those $5 $10 super chats
53:04 - because they'll probably pay for my data
53:07 - fees because I'm calling live thank you
53:09 - I will not be stopped
53:11 - that's right Cody I can't be stopped
53:13 - stupid networks can't stop me
53:17 - yeah I'm I'm up for a game of chess if
53:20 - he has everyone to play so yeah what was
53:25 - I talking about I even forgot Anna my
53:28 - chess ratings mm yeah mastermind groups
53:30 - a mastermind group again what I was
53:32 - talking about was why is mastermind
53:35 - group helpful which is actually you know
53:37 - if you get this course and you pay 47
53:40 - bucks extra you get the mastermind group
53:42 - now why would the mastermind group be
53:44 - helpful
53:45 - let me explain again for mentors you
53:49 - paid them $100 $150 an hour and that's
53:52 - just one hour of your time and each time
53:54 - right this mastermind group is a
53:57 - one-time fee and you even get access to
53:59 - me and you get access to over hundreds
54:03 - of other students who have already
54:04 - joined this course so anytime you need
54:08 - help you can ask us well if you are
54:11 - stuck with the client you don't know
54:12 - what to say or how to keep them you can
54:14 - ask us we can help you and it's just a
54:17 - one-time fee so in my mind it's like
54:21 - it's free you know it's because of the
54:25 - value that it brings to you so that's
54:29 - why I would say the mastermind group is
54:30 - pretty helpful if you're seriously like
54:33 - looking into this if you want to get it
54:35 - later that generally doesn't happen you
54:37 - know because I don't want people joining
54:40 - the group halfway throughout the course
54:42 - I want people to join the group it has
54:44 - to do between where you are right now
54:47 - and then starting to freelance or
54:49 - starting to apply for a job and how to
54:52 - know when you're ready to apply for a
54:54 - job and how to know when you're ready to
54:56 - start freelancing so all those things
54:58 - are explained in this course as well you
55:00 - can make a game with Python yes you can
55:02 - also create Android apps with Python so
55:05 - Python is very powerful if you're
55:07 - looking for web development you can also
55:08 - do that with Python and it pays a lot
55:16 - you can pretty much do most of the stuff
55:18 - in Python yes and Python makes you very
55:21 - productive which is why I love it the
55:22 - most so from moving from beginner to
55:26 - easy level you recommend only practice
55:27 - in 20% theory yes
55:30 - moving from beginner to easy level or
55:32 - intermediate level focus on projects and
55:34 - less theory
55:36 - so do watch the courses but watch the
55:39 - stuff that's hands-on not the stuff
55:40 - that's in this lesson we're gonna be
55:44 - talking about how lexical closures are
55:48 - very useful in programming and why
55:51 - garbage collection is one of the most
55:54 - important things you can do absolute
55:58 - garbage sorry to say but it's just a
56:02 - fact and a lot of times they do this to
56:04 - fill the quota for the course and have
56:06 - enough video so they can justify it in
56:08 - blah blah blah you yes it's
56:12 - useful but there's a time and place for
56:14 - it not when you're a complete beginner
56:15 - it's useful when I'm not 28 I'm 22 it's
56:20 - useful when you are at a higher level
56:23 - and you are a better programmer and your
56:25 - intermediate or advanced then those
56:27 - things are going to be very important to
56:29 - you but in the start absolutely not so
56:31 - mmm practice more than you just like
56:35 - sitting back and like learning theory so
56:37 - yeah because a lot of the times what
56:39 - happens is a lot of the people get to in
56:42 - and on their heads and you guys know
56:43 - those people who think that they're like
56:44 - so smart and they always are like trying
56:47 - to one-up you but they're actually
56:49 - lacking in knowledge and they're lacking
56:51 - in the real skills and they and
56:53 - everybody who meets them knows that you
56:56 - can kind of see it on their face when
56:57 - you talk to them that's what happens
56:58 - when people only focus on right the
57:02 - worst people seriously and that's what
57:03 - happens when people only focus on
57:04 - sitting there literally breathing
57:06 - because it's not hard to watch videos
57:08 - right because you can just literally sit
57:11 - there and just breathe and just watch
57:13 - those videos and that's what these
57:16 - people a lot of the times do and then
57:17 - they just say technical jargon that they
57:19 - don't even understand which is why
57:21 - practicality first and then everything
57:23 - else you know comes after it it's not
57:28 - I'm not saying you shouldn't do it but
57:29 - then
57:29 - you should do it like after it and you
57:31 - should do it less than you actually
57:32 - spend time building things okay you
57:38 - Dassin know your daddy's really good
57:39 - don't don't listen to Vanara the hell
57:41 - are you talking about huh see you cause
57:44 - you going back to your oppa course now
57:45 - beautiful we have a few students who
57:48 - joined the course one of the students
57:50 - who joined the course I wanted to read
57:52 - off to you guys why people are joining
57:54 - this course the number one reason
57:57 - because I asked people but I can't
57:59 - because I don't have access to my other
58:02 - phones or my laptop or anything else
58:04 - yeah I'm on my phone so I what happened
58:09 - I'm gonna paraphrase it but when I was
58:10 - driving the car to coming here I saw my
58:13 - notification I looked at the email and
58:14 - this person was saying that you know I'm
58:17 - about 29 years old I don't have time to
58:20 - waste I have I have a family and then he
58:25 - also said that he doesn't like most of
58:28 - other courses he was taking or boring to
58:30 - death whereas my courses are very fun
58:32 - and interactive
58:33 - I'm alongside you I'm like side by side
58:36 - to you when we're going through these
58:38 - courses I'm not hiding behind a okay
58:42 - guys today we're gonna learn about like
58:47 - you know I'm God I almost put myself to
58:49 - sleep so that's not what it is and it's
58:51 - very practical so I get you to focus on
58:53 - learning practical skills that are real
58:58 - world by helping you build real-world
59:00 - projects then getting past the basics
59:03 - and mastering Python as fast as possible
59:05 - so that is kind of I just made somebody
59:09 - on so yeah that's what that person said
59:11 - to me that said look I don't want to be
59:14 - a sloth and just kind of not take action
59:17 - live a life of indecision do things by
59:21 - default because they were the only
59:22 - things that came my way and that is my
59:26 - reason for joining this course because I
59:27 - want to kind of step it up make this
59:29 - serious investment and take it to the
59:31 - next level okay
59:32 - so that's what it is and again I give
59:35 - you a 60 day money back guarantee
59:37 - because I'm just so behind my course
59:39 - because I just know it's the best you
59:42 - know anytime you don't like it
59:43 - now I give you a refund no questions
59:44 - asked so yeah I'm a hundred percent
59:49 - behind this I think this will be really
59:51 - really helpful for you even if you're
59:52 - remotely serious and especially if
59:55 - you're looking for something to help you
59:56 - go from where you are now maybe a
59:58 - current job to then switching over and
60:03 - there's no prerequisite so you don't
60:05 - need to learn you don't need to take my
60:08 - free course learn Python beforehand and
60:10 - you guys don't need to do you don't even
60:12 - need to know any Python from beforehand
60:14 - you can start from completely scratch
60:15 - are there any disadvantages for living
60:18 - outside the US for example getting
60:19 - clients the way you're teaching us in
60:21 - your course if you're living outside of
60:23 - the US there isn't that much of a
60:26 - disadvantage when I mention specific
60:28 - resources that might be sometimes a
60:30 - disadvantage because those resources
60:32 - might not exist in your country but for
60:35 - the most part the same ideas apply for
60:38 - getting the clients the same thing
60:40 - applies like for example if I tell you
60:43 - one website but that website doesn't
60:45 - work for United States I bet there's
60:48 - something exactly the same in your
60:49 - country 100% you literally have to just
60:52 - Google a web site like Yelp but in India
60:55 - or a website like this in I don't know
60:58 - Germany so it really that's really gonna
61:01 - be the only difference but all of the
61:03 - principles all of those rules apply it
61:05 - doesn't really matter what country
61:06 - you're in if you're taking this course
61:08 - if I pay for your course will you take
61:11 - that money and get an orthodontic
61:12 - doctor's to fix your teeth I probably
61:15 - will I have a messed up tooth right here
61:17 - it's like like a Dracula kind of thing
61:21 - going on and I was kind of born with it
61:24 - so yeah I probably will if you get that
61:26 - course email me and I'll do that and
61:28 - send you a video are the videos in the
61:31 - course the same as the free ones
61:32 - absolutely not it's a paid course it's a
61:35 - premium course and that content is not
61:38 - available anywhere else it's exclusively
61:41 - available on clever programmer once you
61:43 - join this course about a bad bada-boom
61:44 - can I make the course free no because
61:47 - when I get when you guys pay for this
61:49 - course I reinvest and just make it so
61:52 - much better
61:53 - so yeah this course is not for free and
61:57 - then there's a
61:57 - company not clever programmer that were
61:59 - running to make it the best and just
62:02 - leave all the competition in the dust a
62:05 - lot of the times people think life is a
62:08 - zero-sum game if I win the new lose or
62:12 - if you lose or if you win I lose that's
62:15 - not how it is meaning that if somebody
62:17 - pays for the course they think that
62:18 - they're just losing money and it's not
62:20 - possible for them to make money it's
62:22 - like a lose for them that's almost never
62:24 - the case almost every course I've paid
62:26 - for I've made 10 to 20 times that
62:29 - because of what I learned
62:31 - for example Udacity scores called intro
62:35 - to relational databases I remember
62:37 - taking that course and that course alone
62:39 - because I was already advanced this
62:41 - course is not for beginners absolutely
62:43 - not because I was already advanced at
62:46 - the time when I learned those key things
62:48 - from there even though I was being
62:50 - Udacity $200 a month I made like over
62:53 - thirty thousand dollars in just a few
62:55 - months because of what I learned and
62:56 - then what kind of jobs I could do based
62:58 - on that course so just because I paid
63:01 - Udacity it doesn't mean that I lose it's
63:03 - like Udacity want and then I want as
63:06 - well
63:06 - so yeah if I start as a beginner how
63:09 - long god these questions are moving so
63:11 - fast I want to pay for the course but
63:16 - I'm scared how this will help me as an
63:17 - engineer not interested in being a
63:19 - developer F Kanako this course teaches
63:23 - you the principles of getting good at
63:25 - getting clients one and it teaches you
63:28 - how to create apps with Python you can
63:32 - use those apps and you can get more
63:34 - complicated with it and make it really
63:35 - engineering type and not go to the web
63:38 - development route so you can do that but
63:41 - yeah so that's what I would recommend
63:42 - and again 60 you have 60 days to return
63:45 - it if you take it for 40 days and go all
63:48 - out and try everything or you take it
63:50 - for 59 days go all out and try
63:52 - everything and all of a sudden you're
63:53 - like look it's just not it doesn't have
63:56 - that engineering aspect or whatever
63:58 - there's no guilt there's no remorse I
64:00 - don't ask you any questions I refund you
64:01 - because look your one payment isn't
64:05 - gonna really affect anything
64:06 - my main goal for you is to get the
64:09 - skills that you need for
64:10 - to make that transition as fast as
64:12 - possible to the programming field and I
64:15 - want 1 million people to become
64:16 - developers that's one of my goals you
64:19 - know like one of the reasons okay one of
64:23 - the other reasons that I do this is
64:25 - because my dad is really old and my mom
64:27 - is really old and they were really
64:30 - crappy planners so they really so one of
64:33 - my main one of my main main main goals
64:35 - that drives me all the time is I want to
64:37 - give them a really really good
64:39 - retirement and that's actually one of
64:42 - the things that kept me going the
64:43 - software development world and I push
64:45 - myself so hard and I'm much much much
64:47 - younger age so then I can kind of do
64:50 - that for them and they just have a ton
64:51 - of problems like health problems
64:54 - basically and I hate hate when we have
64:57 - to go to like these Cook County
64:59 - hospitals and if there's an emergency I
65:01 - have to take them in and we have to wait
65:03 - like nine hours I think I mentioned this
65:06 - before but my dad like got hypernatremia
65:08 - a super healthy guy played soccer his
65:11 - whole life and he kind of got
65:12 - hypernatremia we went to the hospital
65:14 - and what happened was a doctor would
65:18 - come in he would learn what was going on
65:21 - with him we didn't know he had a
65:22 - hypernatremia hypernatremia is when your
65:23 - sodium levels are really fatally high
65:25 - like you could die high so he was having
65:27 - seizures and all this stuff and it kind
65:29 - of happened out of Norris fit healthy
65:31 - guy who's old but he's healthy and we
65:33 - went to the hospital and each a doctor
65:36 - would come in spend 15 minutes with a
65:38 - playing catch-up of like what the nurse
65:41 - said and everything he'd get caught up
65:42 - and as soon as he got caught up his
65:45 - shift was over
65:46 - and then like a new doctor would come in
65:48 - and then that new doctor would try to
65:50 - diagnose the problem figure it out
65:51 - before he did that he would get caught
65:53 - up with all the notes from the nurse and
65:55 - the previous doctor so once he would get
65:57 - caught up with all those notes his time
65:59 - was up and because of that my dad almost
66:02 - pretty much died because he nobody could
66:05 - figure out that he was suffering from
66:06 - hypernatremia because it's so easy once
66:09 - they figure it out they just figure out
66:10 - how to bring your sodium levels down and
66:12 - you're fine but they couldn't figure it
66:14 - out because they barely spent 15 or 20
66:16 - minutes with him so I never wanted to be
66:18 - in a situation that could happen you
66:20 - know one of Michael's always used to say
66:22 - like I want to get you guys
66:24 - a private doctor that just you know even
66:28 - since I was young so those are some of
66:30 - my goals that kind of drive me past just
66:32 - like superficial stuff like yeah I'm
66:34 - young I want to do crazy stuff jump off
66:36 - planes go out with friends you know buy
66:39 - them drinks and all that but those are
66:40 - some of the things that drive me or like
66:43 - being with my family all the time or
66:46 - friends all the time without worrying
66:48 - about work and all this other stuff
66:49 - that's what kind of drives me let me ask
66:53 - you like what kind of drives you guys
66:55 - and what kind of things you know what
66:58 - would it mean for you if you have the
67:00 - ability to kind of work remotely choose
67:02 - your own hours your own clients and then
67:05 - have enough where you're financially
67:07 - like free essentially like what does
67:09 - that mean for you how much amount of
67:15 - money invested on going
67:19 - okay money in the font cool same as you
67:21 - cool partners lucky to have you cool I
67:24 - would make it rain that's a pretty damn
67:27 - good goal I'm all for that freedom
67:33 - success happiness I love that no
67:36 - nine-to-five I can't stand normalcy
67:39 - lifestyle normalcy and being average is
67:41 - what kills me every single day and I
67:43 - want to run away from it more than
67:45 - anything I'd rather be the worst at
67:47 - something then be average at it can you
67:52 - take this course working second shift as
67:54 - a job like it is time-based at your own
67:56 - pace it's time-based at your own pace
67:58 - it's not a live course and you have
68:00 - lifetime access to it so you can take
68:03 - this course any time and the reason why
68:05 - I make this course is even if you're
68:07 - working second job and you're working on
68:09 - a second shift I teach you just enough
68:12 - and I give you enough practical stuff to
68:14 - get you going and help you start earning
68:16 - an income while learning Python as fast
68:19 - as possible so you don't have that
68:20 - pressure constant pressure that alone
68:23 - that you have a lot of other times when
68:25 - you're making that switch they're just
68:26 - like quit your job and then just do
68:28 - programming it's like I have a family to
68:30 - feed and I have my own bills to pay how
68:33 - am I gonna just quit my job and just do
68:35 - this so yeah there you go so it's
68:37 - possible for
68:37 - you to do this part-time that's you know
68:41 - one of the reasons I want to teach you
68:42 - the most practical stuff in the least
68:44 - amount of time click the link below if
68:49 - you want to get this course now or you
68:51 - want to check it out the link is below I
68:53 - think it's something like clever
68:54 - programmer to slash create - apps - with
68:59 - - Python there you go what is the best
69:03 - place to find work programming many
69:06 - different places it depends where you
69:09 - interview or you apply for freelancing
69:12 - you can even look at something like
69:13 - upwork.com
69:14 - and then look for Python jobs but then
69:17 - the problem that comes up is how do I
69:18 - know I'm ready to apply there how do I
69:20 - stand out from the crowd and what
69:23 - experience do I need before I start
69:24 - applying there so those are the things I
69:26 - cover in this course as well once you
69:30 - guys join this course message me in the
69:33 - YouTube thing and tell us why you joined
69:35 - it so we can see what your reason behind
69:38 - this is and let me know because I have
69:39 - absolutely no way of knowing when
69:41 - anybody is joining god I hate that
69:46 - ok Shreyas asks are you gonna teach
69:49 - something here I'll teach you something
69:51 - when you're doing coding don't always do
69:55 - programming like on a keyboard before
69:57 - you ever ever ever start coding a
70:00 - problem or coming up with a solution to
70:01 - their project or a specific programming
70:04 - problem in Python Java whatever write it
70:07 - write it with hand and understand the
70:10 - logic in English or in the language of
70:12 - your choice understand that and then go
70:15 - from there
70:16 - I joined yesterday because I want to be
70:21 - able to provide for me my fiance and my
70:24 - future life I think that's what Cody
70:26 - says I totally make sense you know I
70:31 - love that what were you doing before
70:32 - Cody you want to tell that to everybody
70:34 - and tell us how what how do you think of
70:36 - the course so far because you've taken
70:38 - the course a little bit so tell us a
70:39 - little bit about it
70:45 - yeah and in the mean time and answer
70:46 - that question write it down
70:49 - in English understand it like dead-on
70:51 - then start coding it it's gonna save you
70:54 - thousands of hours of your time and
70:56 - you're welcome
70:57 - cause ease like the Jesus Christ
71:00 - look-alike you only pick up questions
71:02 - and answers them like a Family Guy
71:03 - there you go perfect description after
71:10 - your beginners course what course is
71:13 - preferred I can't afford your opie
71:14 - course there are a lot of videos that I
71:17 - have on YouTube and then there are a lot
71:20 - of yeah there's a ton of videos and I
71:24 - even have some sequel stuff fqo Academy
71:26 - stuff so there's a ton of stuff that you
71:27 - can start you can keep learning on
71:30 - YouTube
71:39 - Harvard's ethics course really good I
71:46 - game design graduated summa can't find a
71:48 - job in game so I figured okay so he
71:51 - graduated I think in the software of
71:53 - Albarn in games and he couldn't find a
71:55 - job that brings me to another point one
71:57 - of my biggest problems and again the
71:59 - reason behind asteroid clever programmer
72:01 - was I saw a ton of my friends college
72:04 - students who graduated and then they got
72:07 - really sad that they couldn't get a job
72:12 - because a lot of the times the skills
72:15 - taught in colleges are like the polar
72:18 - opposite of what in real world people
72:20 - are looking for when you're applying to
72:22 - those places and that's why you have a
72:24 - lot of trouble getting those jobs and
72:26 - then you wonder why do I have 30 40 50
72:29 - hundred thousand dollars worth of loans
72:33 - so again you know my course doesn't need
72:37 - you to have a college degree or an
72:39 - experience and it just focuses on
72:40 - getting you going as fast as possible
72:43 - Cody says the course is awesome so far
72:46 - cause II will give you feedback in the
72:49 - slide channel and yep I do
72:50 - so yeah look at that so even with all
72:53 - the crazy that I'm doing I will
72:54 - give you feedback and or everything
72:59 - should i do ITR CSM college CS i hate IT
73:03 - computer science this is a way to go man
73:05 - I just enjoy it a lot you know
73:07 - IT has a future as well but I did IT and
73:10 - I wanted to kill myself every day I'm
73:15 - starting something class I want to know
73:17 - if I have college václav says I'm really
73:22 - think to sign up but it's a lot of money
73:24 - for me so anyway thank you for your
73:26 - videos it really helps if you have any
73:28 - questions let me know if you're on the
73:30 - fence guys you know ask me questions and
73:32 - ask me what's going on and I want to be
73:36 - able to help you okay so if you're if
73:39 - you are interested in looking into it if
73:43 - okay here's what I'm going to tell you
73:45 - for interesting you're not the verge of
73:47 - buying it
73:53 - alright guys sorry
73:55 - the thing is gonna start going offline
73:57 - quite a bit now because lots of people
74:00 - are getting this course and joining the
74:02 - course so I'm probably gonna shut off
74:05 - the live video cuz every time somebody
74:07 - gets the course I get a call and then I
74:12 - have this automated thing that I've
74:13 - coded up and programmed so it tells me
74:16 - your name and it tells me what course
74:19 - you just got so that's yeah I've
74:23 - automated it because programming
74:25 - programming is awesome yeah
74:29 - but ill it'll keep distracting the live
74:31 - event that we're doing so I don't want
74:33 - you guys to get annoyed by it you know
74:37 - what I mean but yeah in the meantime go
74:39 - click that link check out the course get
74:42 - the course here's what I'll tell you if
74:43 - you're on the fence get the course try
74:46 - it out and then you can again I can
74:50 - guarantee you're gonna love it
74:52 - you're but if it's not the right fit for
74:54 - you again I have a 60 day money-back
74:57 - guarantee that's not offered any other
74:59 - course look at any other course on udemy
75:01 - or anywhere else all have 30 days I
75:04 - stand behind you know what I'm telling
75:07 - you guys and I wouldn't do I wouldn't
75:09 - tell you to do anything that I wouldn't
75:10 - do we're probably gonna get more clients
75:15 - will I be able to pick up chicks after
75:18 - taking your course absolutely that's
75:21 - actually one of the main things that
75:22 - taught us taught in the course by
75:24 - learning computer programming and then
75:27 - you know getting the jobs you want you
75:29 - probably have the confidence to pick up
75:30 - the chicks that you want man this this
75:34 - gets so deep do you accept paypal yes it
75:39 - accepts paypal I'm also a nice human
75:42 - being and I have a payment plan for you
75:44 - guys as well so you can break it down in
75:46 - three months if you can't pay for it
75:47 - once Bouguer thai i don't want to answer
75:53 - that question it's way too specific
75:55 - doesn't help anybody else
76:03 - Paul Garcia what was your question I'm
76:05 - starting to keep messing it up you yes
76:08 - you can pay using debit card I don't
76:10 - yeah you can you can pay it using debit
76:12 - card
76:13 - what type of Python programming did you
76:16 - do to make money game web app bug bounty
76:18 - web apps gaming there isn't a lot of
76:21 - money unfortunately
76:22 - are you comfortable telling us your
76:24 - income range that you're raking in at
76:26 - this point in your life at all the
76:27 - coding knowledge you have I will tell
76:29 - you that like last one or two years I've
76:32 - been consistently making over a few like
76:35 - a hundred thousand dollars so and that
76:38 - was when I was 20 and 21 years old so
76:41 - yeah that's what I will openly tell you
76:45 - guys what was the longest line of code
76:47 - that you have written on not a month a
76:51 - year
76:51 - um longest line of code and again keep
76:56 - in mind that I'm also working on my own
76:58 - terms like for example when I go to
77:00 - California and I'm going with my
77:02 - brothers or I'm going out with my
77:03 - friends to ski lift or skydive or
77:07 - whatever a lot of the times I'm
77:09 - declining clients so if I just want to
77:11 - go all out and when you can then
77:14 - obviously you can earn a higher level
77:17 - income so
77:27 - we'll yeah I I stopped doing lots of
77:32 - donations but it's actually a lot of fun
77:34 - when you guys did super chat before I
77:36 - think I used to have a lot of donation
77:37 - things because the channel was kind of
77:40 - starting out and now I don't want to do
77:42 - that I just wanna you know if it's free
77:43 - material I want to just have it be free
77:45 - and not have you guys worry about
77:47 - donating or anything but if it's a paid
77:49 - course of paid course if you still want
77:51 - to donate or you want to kind of support
77:52 - the channel because it is helpful
77:55 - you know because off of donations I'll
77:57 - get things like this beautiful
77:59 - microphone and then all the quality of
78:02 - the videos are great you can go to my
78:04 - patreon channel so things called like
78:08 - patreon.com slash clever programmer and
78:11 - then you can become a patron and then
78:13 - it's like a monthly thing no I'm not
78:21 - getting annoyed by your guys's questions
78:23 - alright so guys this is it I'm probably
78:28 - gonna take some more questions for like
78:30 - 30 seconds and then I'm out this is
78:32 - longer Thank You Omar Gomez for sending
78:35 - the $2 a really cool another monster for
78:38 - me um take a little very few questions
78:43 - guys I gotta run I gotta get going in
78:47 - the meantime check out the course it's
78:49 - in the link below create apps with
78:52 - Python helps you land clients you get
78:55 - lifetime access for this it's a
78:57 - no-nonsense practical Python projects
79:00 - and applications so you can start
79:02 - putting on your portfolio I teach you
79:04 - how to get clients where to get clients
79:06 - how to keep clients how you can make the
79:09 - transition to becoming a software
79:10 - consultant in less than three months and
79:13 - much more all of this cover in this
79:16 - course I sound like like a radio host
79:18 - but you know it is what it is it's true
79:22 - [Music]
79:25 - the link is below clever clever
79:28 - programmer to slash create - apps -
79:32 - width - Python somebody please put it in
79:34 - the chat that would be great but the
79:36 - link should be in the description below
79:37 - unless something weird happen
79:39 - the next livestream I think happens to
79:42 - p.m. Thursday on Pacific time but I mean
79:47 - I kind of double-check that and then

79:50 - IDE sublime text when you're starting
79:53 - out I use pie chart but that's for pros
80:02 - this thing is like so nice you know it's
80:06 - very comfortable you guys should have
80:08 - like a nice comfortable chair so when
80:11 - you're programming you know you can do
80:12 - it like a pro yeah it's a great chair
80:19 - okay guys um anybody who gets this
80:24 - course in the next let's say 15 minutes
80:27 - you can email me and then we can also do

81:38 - love you and I'll see you in the next
81:41 - video

Cleaned transcript:

whoa hey guys how's it going alright guys welcome to this live broadcast with Kazi from clever programmer and in this video we're gonna talk a little bit about how you can go and become a Python developer in months and not yours so let's jump right into it alright so guys unbelievable unbelievabl so yeah we're gonna discuss all of those things in this video okay but I just got to kind of talk about this for the first time in my life ever my computer is just not working so I got to my office that's where I am right now you got to my office literally like turning on my computer and it just shuts off so the broadcast starts at 400 and then that's why I came on a few minutes later so I'm doing this from my phone right now hopefully it's working well from the phone how is it looking on your guyses and I know Austin I know sorry man Eid Mubarak sweet okay if anybody is having trouble kind of let me know but that's good to know that it's working alright looks good beautiful alright guys so yeah you know I want to kind of cover a lot of things in this one but I just want to go through most of the things stepbystep let me make it a little bit better hopefully my phone won't fall I like to set it up on my tripod and then it's just like hanging on by the thread alright so in this one I'm gonna be taking some of your guys's questions as you guys know my create apps with Python or Python opie create apps course has finally launched so what I do is I take a cohort of students who joined then we run through a few months one two three months or maybe even more and then we go through that course together it's not live it's recorded right so when you get it you actually have lifetime access to it and then I launch it again so right now my course is open and it closes on June 30th so in three four days from now now in the last few videos I've talked a little bit about how much value there is in becoming a software developer right and kind of the job opportunity things of that nature so before I start let me ask you guys are you guys interested in becoming a software developer and why I kind of want to hear your reasons why you're looking into becoming a programmer so let me know below and I kind of want to see that HUD nice but this is kind of cool you know cuz I can just hold this up show you guys a little bit about my office here okay so a jack says freelance what else because I love being creative whatever is in my mind I want to create mobile apps always interested in programming my job ends on ah Tom Lynch I remember you man that's awesome I mean I don't know if that's awesome you said your job ends in seven freelance for one for fun I want to give it a try okay so I'm gonna parole I'm gonna probe a little bit further and a little bit deeper okay so I got a lot of things like I want to do I want to be creative I want to just try out something new so by programming why not literally anything else why not computer networking I love the fact that saw really based on imagination Python for web development bring your ideas to life okay those are really cool reasons Cody Cody just joined our course recently okay so a lot of you guys are saying that you want to do this because one let me get this right you like the challenge too because you can take what's in here make it a reality three how about this one doing something you know when you create a solution or you solve a problem all of a sudden it can be scaled instantly to millions of people does that kind of sound important hell yeah yeah so you know that's exactly you know one of their I'll tell you one of my reasons was because I did computer networking and kind of hated it oh my god like I was going to college and my brother was my brother was like hey why don't you do something so you're ahead of other people so while I was going to college I thought I don't want to just um you know not do anything or kind of figure out life by default this is something I talk about a lot right like you guys know how sloths survive so let me tell you how slots survive they're so slow right they're so slow they are weak they just drag along everywhere so how in the world have this survived till now how is that a possibility one very interesting thing is that sloths live on branches okay they live on like trees but like on top of it and they just kind of hold on to a branch and they live there now the thing about them is that they don't really take in a lot of they don't need a lot of food and stuff because they don't spend that much energy so because they're just literally chillin Netflix and chilling pretty much the entire time the Netflix and they just kind of you know that's how they survive they need to eat very less now the animals that are at the top that can actually get to them are not really interested in eating them because those animals are usually smaller the animals at the bottom which are really giant really huge and can then come at the top and then out but the problem is that when they try to get to where the slots are they end up breaking those branches right those branches end up breaking and they end up falling so they can't eat them and so when I found this out first of all I thought it was really cool I thought oh my god you know that's pretty weird but you know that's how salons actually survive and live up to 20 or thirty years and then I was thinking holy slots survived by just existing like they literally survived by just existing the service survived by default okay so to relate it back to when I was kind of going in college I didn't wanna survive by just existing which was any job opportunity that comes my way I kind of accept it any any literally any upper like any college that comes your way you kind of accepted any first job opportunity comes your way you accept it and a lot of the times you even accept working 9 to 5 doing lots of tedious soulcrushing paper shuffling kind of work and you find out they it's like thirty years that you've been doing this and then you kind of just spent your whole life like my uncle he was half a year from retiring he worked for this company for 29 years and he was gonna get started getting a pension and everything from them and then what happened was he got sick and he couldn't work so he had to quit and no pension for him and he literally has to survive off of whatever little money that he's gonna start getting in Social Security income and then he has like four kids that kind of have to survive off of that so for me I personally saw a lot of that and a lot of just kind of like people have this helplessness that happens a lot of the times whether it's you don't have enough money or whether you're doing something that makes you miserable those all kind of make you helpless and that's why I wanted to just pick something that allowed me to enjoy but then also earn a living that I can support not only myself but other people around me so I thought okay that's gonna be computer not working for me and then I joined computer networking and I wanted to kill myself in computer networking but then I joined but then I started doing computer programming I found out about it what I'm you know my oldest brother called me and he's like hey have you ever looked into this thing and I said no but I'm gonna check it out and then I started looking into it and I said hole the crap what is this this is the most amazing thing because I can take literally what's in my brain and turn it into a reality right like make it a real thing that people can use so you can do the same thing you can put something that you made online that people can use play around with and it's literally like they're playing around with the ideas that you have in your head but in reality and then that's how I kind of got started on this path but I'm not now I want to talk to you about you know this industry is where kind of the world is heading so first of all it's fun it almost feels like a glitch when somebody pays you to code because you're thinking it's literally something that I do for fun and I'm getting paid for it imagine like you watch Game of Thrones and you get paid for it or you're sitting there watching house of cards and you get paid for it imagine going for you know like I don't know going for this is the only thing that's coming to my mind because I did that a few months ago like jumping off of a plane and having fun enjoying your life or going to Six Flags and then somebody pays you for it so literally that's kind of how it was for me and I was able to get to the level where I was getting paid to code in less than three months and I got a lot a lot a lot a lot of you know I when I make a video like that or I even have a video I get so many people just hatin and write and writing on me basically and there's going you can't do this in three months and start getting paid it takes 25 years and so the reason why I started this clever programmer channel was kind of to debunk that myth mmm i feii in dedup you know this was something that I ended up discovering and I was like okay this is not that hard you don't need to be some kind of math genius you don't need to be some kind of like prodigy to learn computer programming it doesn't matter kind of how old you are because I know people who are 60 years old who started and then they ended up getting a career in this but now one of my goals was okay I want to start a career in this fast and once I kind of did that this is something that I wanted to share with other people how can you then start your own career just rolling and then doing this faster and here are a few things that I'm gonna tell you that will help you so if you're watching this right now you know just close your other tabs if you have chrome and everything you know just close all of them out I can't just want you and I it just be oneonone here for a second okay you know put your phone on Do Not Disturb and just relax get some popcorn get a legal pad this is what I use a lot just really helps me you know I write down my ideas here and that's how when I'm coding that's how I solve problems as well like I literally write them down by hand and that just it really helps me like putting things on paper so that's what I would suggest because I'm gonna give you some really valuable resources that will save you I don't know ten to hundreds of thousands of dollars and this is not a joke there are and those resources are free and then I also want to share with you some ways of how you can improve your coding skills you know so here's one of them really really important things that you should do okay schools hate them that's hilarious yet they do here's one of the really important things so somebody just asked me how do you start as a beginner I'm gonna tell you right now one of I will guide you okay one of the main you should focus on is play if you're learning and you wanna be you want to improve really fast focus on improving your focus on improving the time you spend playing with it okay so whatever skill it is that you're trying to get focus on just playing then learn later so if there was a 80/20 right something that there's like an 80 up here and a 20 up here something that you spent short amount of time on something you spent a lot of time on a lot of people will tell you watch you know a video on udemy and Coursera just like learn and then don't do anything else what you should be doing is spending most of the time not learning theory but most of the time should be spent actually playing so 80% of the time should be actually spent playing and 20% of your time should actually be spent really learning the theory behind things okay so if it's computer programming for you this is what I would suggest and I won't even go further than that and I want to say it's almost like eighty ten or eighty fifteen five okay that gets really complicated but play build learn so most of your time should be spent playing then the rest of your time should be spend building and then the rest of your time should be spent learning and the reason why that's important is because first of all you associate fun and enjoyment with that skill so if it's you want to become a programmer right and you don't want to spend years literally years and years trying to become a programmer and start enjoying what you're doing and that happens a lot of the times by playing with that making it kind of natural for you then use that to build stuff okay and then once you start using it to build stuff now you have stuff to show for what you did because that's practical like you and I were busy we don't have all the time in the world to focus on one thing and then just do it for 20 hours a day you want to spend your time and get the most out of it right so when you play and you build now you have something to over it even on your portfolios when you're going to get clients for Python and doing freelancing or if you want to even apply the software developer you're building a portfolio as you are going okay and then you have although at the bottom you have learning so you want to kind of do the learning part and you want to and actually shorten that a little bit so you want to spend less time learning and more time building things with it getting done I'm a huge proponent of doing things rather than just passively sitting there and learning because what happens is that it doesn't become a part of you and you also don't have anything to show for it because a lot of the times what would happen to me is I'd be taking these courses on and you can write these resources down because they're all free and very valuable udemy okay so if anybody knows the spellings of these please put it in chat code Academy team treehouse Udacity Coursera and edex okay and all of these guys have you know PhDs from UC Berkeley and people who are working for Google and people whatever and they're teaching you and most of them are free so you can actually pick up those technical skills from right there but a lot of the times what happens is I'd be taking these courses and would be working on really esoteric things like a for example recursive Fibonacci solution or we'll be working on you know using the Fibonacci to make this like circle get the area under the curve using Python and this stuff improved my coding skills but at the end of the day when I got done I didn't have anything to show for it I didn't have anything that I could take to my clients and I don't want that to happen for you guys because that's how you end up spending years and you don't have anything to show for it at the end of the day like when I was actually starting out one of my friends got a job before I did because I focused so much on the theory stuff he focused more on just building web apps and things and he knew less than I did he was way less skilled than I am and he ended up getting a job faster than I did he started getting consulting work and freelancing work faster than I did because all of the things that he was learning he was building and then when he went to apply he had stuff to show for it he even had recruiters find his stuff on websites like github they found his activities that he was kind of doing on meetup.com and wherever like he was going to all these groups they're like you know what we're gonna hire this person because there are actual projects that this guy has write actual work so that's what I would tell you to focus on so if you're debating between taking a course from one of these websites and you're trying to think about them right which website should I take a course from where should I go first of all make sure that the instructor is the right fit for you and then make sure that what you're learning isn't so theoretical in a satirical oh I love you too you say you love me from Egypt I love you from Chicago I'm in Chicago right now so basically that's you know one of the things when you build those things you build projects somebody asked me what do you build well when you're okay for example I'll give you an example instead of doing a recursive Fibonacci solution work on building a tictactoe game I'll get a lot of hate from developers on this but you know there is a time and place for doing those like recursive Fibonacci solution and like complicated things with data structures there is a time in place but what I want to focus on with you is practical stuff that gets you started because look you don't have so much time some of you guys maybe 20 30 40 years old some of you guys maybe have a family some of you guys already have a job you don't have time to learn all this other crap which is beautiful it's a lot of fun but you don't have all this time to learn it so what I want you to focus on instead is focus on things that build a portfolio for you so you can start working and once you start earning an income then all of a sudden you have time for it you you're working in IT field right now and you start earning an income from Python you can go you know what I can start dropping some of my work I can put it a few hours into the site each job and more hours into Python all of a sudden you're learning faster what should have taken you years is now taking you months then you could go even further and just say okay I don't want to do IT at all and just switch over to Python and you can do that as well because those things are really important like how do I make that career switch how do I go from my current job to Python development and that was another one of those things I didn't see some anybody explain which was okay great they're all this course covers really technical stuff and I'm picking up lots of technical skills but how do I go from my current job to becoming a software developer how do I go from what I'm currently doing to doing programming or sorry doing programming and kind of getting paid for it because I want to be doing real practical stuff how do I go on to build a portfolio how do I know I'm ready to start freelancing how do I know I'm ready to apply for a job how do I know where do I go to find clients how do I know how to keep those clients what do I say when I'm about to lose a client you know and most of these courses aren't even like teaching a lot of the times a projectbased way of learning but those that do those are really really really really helpful some of the courses that have helped me and you guys could write it down and you guys actually could go take these courses or free intro to computer science course on Udacity write it down don't open that tab and go to it yet you can always go to it later but this is important then you have courses on Coursera and it's called intro to interactive programming and Python on freaking believable course and it's actually free of cost the drawback of those courses they don't teach you how you convert to actually making money how do you even the projects that you built put it on your portfolio and all that but the great thing is that the course has a lot of great valuable information in there so if you want to improve your technical skills great place to go to again this is another one of those reasons why I created my create apps with Python course so first of all I already have you know like about 150 videos on YouTube and I have my free course which is called learn Python but the point of my new course which is called create absolute Python or Python olp create apps is literally how do you go from knowing nothing to learning Python while building a portfolio while trying to earn an income as you learn because that's what I found the secret was between the people who took years to learn programming versus months for me it took me months like one to two months and I was getting paid to code that's why so many people can wrap their mind around it because then what I was able to do is just completely drop the other thing that I was doing is focused on software development and then that allowed me to be in a position where and it will allow it can allow you as well to be in a position where you can choose to work for somebody or not you can choose to hire or fire a client you can choose to kind of work on your own hours and then it's fun like when you're actually working as well those are one those are a few of the things that I really liked and I saw that you guys kind of like that as well so that's what I would suggest you know if you're gonna take those online courses from the websites that I've mentioned above make sure that they're projectbased and they have something on your portfolio so when you walk in you don't look like an idiot okay and again if you're ready to make that leap that is again one of the reasons why I made this course teaching you programming skills along with all of the skills that go along with it this is something I explained earlier being good at interview or being good at getting jobs is different than being good being a good software developer they're two different things and the example I always give is in my high school I was like almost certified dumped I got a really really low score on my AC T which is a standardized test they use in the United States to figure out how intelligent you are basically and I got a really low score on that but at the same time I was top 1% in the world for chess and still am so how can somebody be top 1% in chess and kind of know a few things but then get such a low score on a CT that they are actually like they're almost certified dumb like I wouldn't tell anybody I was so embarrassed and I'm actually sharing this now and what I ended up finding out was it's not about how smart yours about how good you are taking that test so it's not really capturing your intelligence it's really focusing on improving those testing skills those tests taking specific skills so now let's go back to computer programming and software development getting good at interviews is very different getting a job and having a good portfolio that lands you clients gets people to work with you is very different from being a good programmer I myself don't have 20 years of experience programming but I charge my clients like 10 times more than some of my mentors I was working with when I was starting out and they're rock star programmers who've been freaking working their ass off since they were 5 years old and they're just like they know everything inside and out about programming they can probably program better than they can actually even walk or talk literally and then it you know so there are two completely different things so again that's what I want to focus on for you that's my goal for you for you to be able to make that transition from whatever you're currently doing from whatever your current job is to making that switch as fast as possible to the programming field to the software development field from going from scratch being able to create apps and then being able to actually get clients from it okay so if you guys are interested in my course or you want to learn just learn more about it and see what it's about the link is right below or it should be if it isn't I don't know what I'll have to do because I'm on my phone and I can't really do anything my computer isn't coming on so it is what it is but my course should be in the links below can you see can somebody tell me if it is it is right okay beautiful oh my name is Rafa Kazi kuber's okay so I'm gonna start taking questions from you guys now but yeah if you guys are interested in course you want to find out more about it literally clink click the link below right now I stand behind my courses so much first of all you know they they give you tremendous value and hands down these are the best courses out there the reason why I know is because I've taken literally every course and like for certifications from Coursera I have like three certifications from EDX I have taken the courses on Udacity like four of them team treehouse code Academy pretty much everywhere and then I what I didn't find from there is what this course is about but you know again I stand behind him so much that before I was doing a 30 day money you know money back now you're not happy for any reason I'm gonna give you 60 days on it so for any freakin reason you don't like it cause II your jokes are not funny anymore or you're looking ugly and I want to return it like sure no problem no questions asked alright now I'm gonna take your questions the link is below click that link in the mean times let's jump in to these questions and I'm gonna try to turn on my computer because it's really pissing me off gonna have to buy a new computer all right Neil Patel says what about you to me um I'm gonna have to write down these questions somewhere too because they're moving so fast okay so somebody asked what about you to me you to me is really good but it's made by a bunch of old people who that's what I think you know they were running a little tight on their budget and they're like crap we're gonna make a course so we can pay the bills for June and they're like behind a PowerPoint behind a slide that has zero passion they're not interested in what they're teaching you that's one of my biggest problems with a udemy if you can get something from Udacity go there first like if you're looking between those academic resources and you don't really care about making money from Python then go to Hey Bruce how's it going then go to Udacity always go to Udacity first then go other places udemy sucks like most people are young you to me because they always have a 90 I know this because I take so many questions from you to me and it's always like oh they have a 95% promotion sale going on so I'm just gonna buy 30 courses that I'm never gonna take so that's really what it is yeah I want to shoot myself a lot of the times when I'm going on you to me there's no production quality they make it in like one sitting on a Wednesday there's like it just pisses me off because there's no love for this like let me show you okay how much love I have for this monster monster okay I have my frickin office over here I spend all my time making these courses for you guys like I'm a psychopath like I love it so much and it's built with so much passion you know I hire crews I have to software develop I have software developers working for me I have marketing development representatives I have business consultants I have video editors and then I work with them and we work together to make sure that we give you the highest quality and the best material possible it again it all started from just me zero people's your subscribers just a few months ago seven eight months ago and this is my passion this is what I love to teach this is what I love to do this is what I'm about you know this is not oh I want to make some extra cash money and let me make one course over the weekend put it on you to me because they'll market it for me and yeah hopefully there'll be a 90 percent sale and a bunch of people will buy it and cool we get to go to like Mexico and have a nice little vacation with our family know like I gave up my clients I gave up my software development jobs and I'd the reason why I did that so I can go and fight or flight mode and then just give it all I've got to bring clever programmer to the people to you guys and bring this message out and the word of software development how amazing it is out okay all right kuber's i'm mm not 1900 what types of things go on your portfolio let's see you build a web app using simple frameworks with Python flask which in this course I'm actually going to show you I'm gonna have videos on flask as well in my course I go over where do you get clients how can you earn an income while learning Python this is one of the biggest secrets once I found this out it helped me make a switch to programming in months not years and once I found this out I helped my best friend quit his soulcrushing paper shuffling tedious job at CVS that he was doing from 900 to 500 making $13 an hour to making $75 an hour with the clients that he was working with and he was making about seven to eight thousand dollars a month doing computer programming software development in a few months so it is possible the reason why I don't like to always throw these numbers out people are like can you guarantee my success sorry Cody I'm gonna throw you under the bus here but I can only put the path for you they're like my oldest brother did for me like my coding mentors did for me I want to kind of return that favor but you do have to put in the effort when I started out I was putting in 20 hours a day my mentor would come at 7 p.m. and he would see me working at this coworking space and then he would help me and then he would leave at 900 p.m. he would go to sleep at 10 p.m. whatever he'd wake up he'd go to his job he'd come back and I was work he would come back and I would still be working there my eyes would be like red bloodshot and I'd be solving a coding problem or doing a coding challenge and then also what it made me realize was that's not practical for most of you guys that's impossible for most of you guys right that's not you know you guys have things going on and so how can I make this so you get the most practical stuff and it gets you results in the least amount of time I'm not saying the least amount of effort but the least amount of time gets you real results yeah so let's see yeah no that that's okay you know for how do you get high in code I don't get high that's okay if you this is this course is a serious investment and I understand that but it literally has material that can change your life and it took me months of time to make this into the best course possible I do have one hundred and sixty videos that are completely free of cost all over it on YouTube and then my learn Python course is also completely free with exercises quizzes and everything so if this is too expensive for you that is completely fine there are courses available that I have that you don't have to pay a penny for but if you're interested in this course which you should be if you're serious about this at least take a look into it the link is below and then decide for yourself whether this is an investment you want to make or not but this course does close this course closes on Friday June 30th and then it'll be probably many months before I launch it again so what I like to do is I get the students and then I want to focus on them I don't want to talk about this course I don't want to spend any time outside of working with the students for taking this course and then also any time any new videos get added any time any new live interviews if I do for this course get added or any bonus content that gets added if you have lifetime access to everything for free if you join this course so if the price increases for this course later on which it probably will because I keep adding so much stuff to this you'll have access to it for free of cost so you don't have to pay a single penny once new stuff gets added that's what happened to all the you know students who joined it the last time it launched it was way cheaper and every time anything got added it was free of cost so my the way this course is really done it's very simple I put money by focus on putting money back in your pocket most Python courses or most courses on programming teach you technical skills only and they don't focus on putting money in your pocket so you're not making anything mmm they just charge you what they charge you my course focus is on making sure to kind of put that back in your pocket all right I'm in a coding boot camp right now for a Java course is it a good idea to learn Python simultaneously should I learn statistics and R before I learn Python so I'm going to answer that question there are too many things going on and you need to just narrow down and focus on one thing so don't worry so much about languages worry about the concepts if you started with Java or R and you and it's been years you don't need to make that switch it doesn't make sense if you're just starting out languages don't matter the concepts do the reason why I mentioned Python and I'm a big proponent of Python and I preach Python and I say start with Python is because one it's the easiest to it's one of the most highly trending it just beat out Java in popularity last year and three it's one of the most highly paid it's literally up there with JavaScript and all those languages that get paid the most so and it's used in the biggest companies you can imagine Instagram Google YouTube it's probably even used at NASA for like doing data science stuff so from all the way web development to data science pythons got you covered it's like United autos insurance 7 7 3 2 you know what I mean so that's what it is I need some books to go hard here's a book it's called Python programming incredible book it's not my book I will probably write a book soon but get this really freaking good book unbelievable what do you recommend for a resources left oh god damn it oh I'm so sorry ok somebody did a super chat which is so cool this is the first time somebody did a super chat with me so this is actually really exciting he just paid $5 thank you so much I do apologize because I'm on a livestream on my phone and any message that comes up it just goes away and hides so unless I see it it kind of goes away so I try to write it down but I think you asked me something along the lines of what kind of book can I get after the livestream I'll try to find your message and reply back to you but what I will say is that this is a good resource really good resource to start off with focus on learning the concepts first and then you can switch to any programming ok so any language so for example if you pick up Python then you can switch to JavaScript you know in like two days not a big problem okay what do you recommend for resources slash books for people who want to learn Python to work in all finance electronics ok so again good book to get started off with I do have experience I have I also have lots of students were like PhDs and then going for their masters at UFC I have another student who's going she's going for her PhD at UFC and I was coaching her when I was like 19 years old so I've just been doing crazy stuff since like you know just I just go really hard when I jump into something and one of the things that you know for her she's trying to learn all these skills and still what I recommend for a lot of them is start with basics people who want to do complicated things will look into complicated things and they'll think there are past the basics and then their programming skills are absolute I'm sorry but that's what it is my students who are going to get their PhDs were way worse programmers and some of my students who didn't know anything about programming and they even thought they were dumb but they learned way better and they were much much much better you mean UFC somebody just said UFC UFC is awesome I love watching UFC one of my students also goes and does trading so for trading there are also frameworks and Python that you can use focus on becoming a better developer and then you can actually leverage these big frameworks for things like trading and you know basically you can use those frameworks then and you won't need to know any math or any crazy stuff behind them because they'll take care of it for you that's why I love software development the book name is somebody please write the book name for him but the book is called Python programming and introduction to computer science by John Zell and people who spend time buying things like this books like this somebody even in my slack channel was asking questions and I kind of got upset at him I shouldn't have but it's like three sodas guys but you're gonna spend this time oh my god Austen thank you so much somebody said they thought this is crazy it's like live streamers when they get money is just cool it's like five bucks one buck like you just bought me you know like whew a few more of these monsters thank you guys like this is what it takes for me to code for you and make those videos so the more you get any of these monsters the more training sessions you'll have there's some super chat option but seriously you should not be asking should I invest in getting this book like there's something wrong with you if that happens because this is worth like three sodas it's like 15 bucks maybe 10 bucks so in knowledge invest first and then think later all and also all these always have a moneyback guarantee so you get it and you don't like it you can literally read like half of it and then return it that's a cheap thing to do I don't recommend it I never do it but if that's what you're worried about spending that money which you were going to invest in probably sodas or I don't know HBO or Netflix subscription anyways or your extra phone bill like it's much better to spend it here yeah like don't be so hesitant of spending when it comes to knowledge and learning things like I'm so crazy I bought a $4,000 course I actually have a video on it and that course is called God zero to launch and it's a business course and it helped me take clever programmer to where it is right now from zero to well I can't give it all the I can't give it all of the credit because I work really hard but yes it's a four thousand dollar course go look it up it's called zero to launch I even have a video on actually buying it live and what I was thinking before making that purchase it's a 59 minute long video but even a few things that I got from it were just so incredible but you know there's a reason why clever programmer went from zero subscribers to over 55,000 subscribers in a few months you know and thanks to you guys because if you guys are not here there is no channel right it doesn't exist if you're not here literally right now sitting here watching this this channel doesn't exist so like I need you and that's what's like valuable for me and that course taught me how to connect better with you and help you out better and that's what I've been focusing on okay yeah and that's just one of the courses like I have so many freaking courses that are really really a you know expensive but when you think of the return on investment they're not that expensive because of the things that they teach you like for example let's say you paid thousand dollars for a course it teaches you how to get a client let's say you get three clients do you have these clients pay you $50 a month or sorry $50 an hour yes it my course does have a mastermind group okay anyways so let's say it pays you to pay you $50 an hour that's one hundred and fifty dollars if you have four sessions with them in just one month that's 150 times four that's six hundred dollars in one month that's twelve hundred dollars in the next month you've paid off the thousand dollar course in just two months one of the students that clever programmer tried one of our strategies and in 72 hours she had booked three clients she went from thirteen dollars an hour to having three clients paying her $60 an hour and she was working fulltime at a job that she hated and so this just kind of freed her up yeah they're launched it's really expensive course but if you're serious about business it's a pretty damn good course what kind of programs you recommend uh thank you guys I love the super chats coming in that's so crazy um okay is there any major difference between the videos I upload on YouTube and the course that's a really good question there absolutely is a ginormous difference I can't control how I put things on YouTube for example if I want to put a challenge for you there's no nice way for me to put it in the course if I want to lay it out in the best way possible I don't have control over that if I want to make a change to something I can't do that as well because things are kind of set in stone if I want to email you a specific video that's timesensitive or there's like a specific opportunity that I think you should look into a reply I don't have a way of connecting with you from fate and YouTube so easily so when I'm on my when I'm in the when you get the course all of that stuff is in one place like for example I have hundred and seventy videos online right now and you could probably just look at them and learn a lot of things and then try to put the pieces together that's what I always did spend thousands of hours trying to put the pieces together like for example it took me two years to learn how to make a web app I can teach you in one hour I swear to god I've done this for so many of my students who took oneonone lessons with me one hour I can teach you that or even less and that was something that took me two years alone because I never wanted to invest in myself and I just wanted to put the pieces together I want to take every free course and I did and there's nothing wrong with that but it just takes extra time so if you have extra time then um you can you know if you have extra time then you can watch the videos on YouTube and try to put it together but in the course it's in a nice linear structure step by step for you to follow so then you get this right stuff at the right time and then you get the most results so that's really what it is it's just packaged together perfectly for you saving you time saving you money okay so you don't have to get ten different courses this one course is you know kind of covers most of those things now once you start earning an income while you learn which is one of the key key key things I think then you can go and invest in more technical courses which is also something that I did because I got really technical courses what kind of programs you recommend to write for beginners programs that I recommend thank you for the super chat yeah that was really cool the programs I say that beginners should write and write this down tictactoe great program to write write that down rockpaperscissors in my free course I actually go over how to do rockpaperscissors for completely free full project for you and you can take that course for free on my website on clever programmer calm that's another great thing to do some other ones that are fun to do is like basic web apps those are another ones that are fun programs that you can do or like a snake game where you're like a little snake going around and then you're collecting those little coins those help your skills and also show people you can build real world apps making them more likely to pay you to code for them how many money you invested through your programming learning days a lot what I would do is all the hourly income that I made from chess and I was even back back even and that day I was charging clients like $150 an hour to coach them in chess and all the money but now you know that happened like a little bit later like before even when I was making 50 or $35 an hour coaching clients for chess what I would do is I don't think of my money as this one static thing I think of it as a very dynamic thing meaning I didn't think of it as money I just thought of it like I can use it to trade skills so for example all the money I made for chess I hired like first of all I invests it by getting online courses or you know books like these or hiring and tours and then working with them one on one side use my chest money to help me improve faster in programming it's not that I won't get there it just it takes you longer to connect the dots but when you have somebody who knows the ropes who knows where you are right now where you need to go who knows your weaknesses who can challenge in the right way that improves your speed by by years seriously so those were some of the things that helped me personally a lot and so I switched basically my I use my chest skills to become better in Python skills I'm sorry I'm missing your guys's question can you give a tip for teenagers I don't know about that Python or Java for first Python for first how easy is Python for someone who knows some Perl very easy could you explain the mindset between the definitions index that's very technical advantages of the mastermind group advantages of the mastermind group okay how many people are here okay so um yeah my so sorry guys what is this this is crazy we launched so many people okay hopefully you guys are coming back and reconnecting that kind of sucks this is so annoying my phone is not dead but the problem that happened yeah I'm alive the problem that happened is that it disconnected because of this WiFi there's just like everything you know the first little computer died when I came in here and it's still dead and then the WiFi died so I switched to LTE rip data so thank you guys for those super chats and those $5 $10 super chats because they'll probably pay for my data fees because I'm calling live thank you I will not be stopped that's right Cody I can't be stopped stupid networks can't stop me yeah I'm I'm up for a game of chess if he has everyone to play so yeah what was I talking about I even forgot Anna my chess ratings mm yeah mastermind groups a mastermind group again what I was talking about was why is mastermind group helpful which is actually you know if you get this course and you pay 47 bucks extra you get the mastermind group now why would the mastermind group be helpful let me explain again for mentors you paid them $100 $150 an hour and that's just one hour of your time and each time right this mastermind group is a onetime fee and you even get access to me and you get access to over hundreds of other students who have already joined this course so anytime you need help you can ask us well if you are stuck with the client you don't know what to say or how to keep them you can ask us we can help you and it's just a onetime fee so in my mind it's like it's free you know it's because of the value that it brings to you so that's why I would say the mastermind group is pretty helpful if you're seriously like looking into this if you want to get it later that generally doesn't happen you know because I don't want people joining the group halfway throughout the course I want people to join the group it has to do between where you are right now and then starting to freelance or starting to apply for a job and how to know when you're ready to apply for a job and how to know when you're ready to start freelancing so all those things are explained in this course as well you can make a game with Python yes you can also create Android apps with Python so Python is very powerful if you're looking for web development you can also do that with Python and it pays a lot you can pretty much do most of the stuff in Python yes and Python makes you very productive which is why I love it the most so from moving from beginner to easy level you recommend only practice in 20% theory yes moving from beginner to easy level or intermediate level focus on projects and less theory so do watch the courses but watch the stuff that's handson not the stuff that's in this lesson we're gonna be talking about how lexical closures are very useful in programming and why garbage collection is one of the most important things you can do absolute garbage sorry to say but it's just a fact and a lot of times they do this to fill the quota for the course and have enough video so they can justify it in blah blah blah you yes it's useful but there's a time and place for it not when you're a complete beginner it's useful when I'm not 28 I'm 22 it's useful when you are at a higher level and you are a better programmer and your intermediate or advanced then those things are going to be very important to you but in the start absolutely not so mmm practice more than you just like sitting back and like learning theory so yeah because a lot of the times what happens is a lot of the people get to in and on their heads and you guys know those people who think that they're like so smart and they always are like trying to oneup you but they're actually lacking in knowledge and they're lacking in the real skills and they and everybody who meets them knows that you can kind of see it on their face when you talk to them that's what happens when people only focus on right the worst people seriously and that's what happens when people only focus on sitting there literally breathing because it's not hard to watch videos right because you can just literally sit there and just breathe and just watch those videos and that's what these people a lot of the times do and then they just say technical jargon that they don't even understand which is why practicality first and then everything else you know comes after it it's not I'm not saying you shouldn't do it but then you should do it like after it and you should do it less than you actually spend time building things okay you Dassin know your daddy's really good don't don't listen to Vanara the hell are you talking about huh see you cause you going back to your oppa course now beautiful we have a few students who joined the course one of the students who joined the course I wanted to read off to you guys why people are joining this course the number one reason because I asked people but I can't because I don't have access to my other phones or my laptop or anything else yeah I'm on my phone so I what happened I'm gonna paraphrase it but when I was driving the car to coming here I saw my notification I looked at the email and this person was saying that you know I'm about 29 years old I don't have time to waste I have I have a family and then he also said that he doesn't like most of other courses he was taking or boring to death whereas my courses are very fun and interactive I'm alongside you I'm like side by side to you when we're going through these courses I'm not hiding behind a okay guys today we're gonna learn about like you know I'm God I almost put myself to sleep so that's not what it is and it's very practical so I get you to focus on learning practical skills that are real world by helping you build realworld projects then getting past the basics and mastering Python as fast as possible so that is kind of I just made somebody on so yeah that's what that person said to me that said look I don't want to be a sloth and just kind of not take action live a life of indecision do things by default because they were the only things that came my way and that is my reason for joining this course because I want to kind of step it up make this serious investment and take it to the next level okay so that's what it is and again I give you a 60 day money back guarantee because I'm just so behind my course because I just know it's the best you know anytime you don't like it now I give you a refund no questions asked so yeah I'm a hundred percent behind this I think this will be really really helpful for you even if you're remotely serious and especially if you're looking for something to help you go from where you are now maybe a current job to then switching over and there's no prerequisite so you don't need to learn you don't need to take my free course learn Python beforehand and you guys don't need to do you don't even need to know any Python from beforehand you can start from completely scratch are there any disadvantages for living outside the US for example getting clients the way you're teaching us in your course if you're living outside of the US there isn't that much of a disadvantage when I mention specific resources that might be sometimes a disadvantage because those resources might not exist in your country but for the most part the same ideas apply for getting the clients the same thing applies like for example if I tell you one website but that website doesn't work for United States I bet there's something exactly the same in your country 100% you literally have to just Google a web site like Yelp but in India or a website like this in I don't know Germany so it really that's really gonna be the only difference but all of the principles all of those rules apply it doesn't really matter what country you're in if you're taking this course if I pay for your course will you take that money and get an orthodontic doctor's to fix your teeth I probably will I have a messed up tooth right here it's like like a Dracula kind of thing going on and I was kind of born with it so yeah I probably will if you get that course email me and I'll do that and send you a video are the videos in the course the same as the free ones absolutely not it's a paid course it's a premium course and that content is not available anywhere else it's exclusively available on clever programmer once you join this course about a bad badaboom can I make the course free no because when I get when you guys pay for this course I reinvest and just make it so much better so yeah this course is not for free and then there's a company not clever programmer that were running to make it the best and just leave all the competition in the dust a lot of the times people think life is a zerosum game if I win the new lose or if you lose or if you win I lose that's not how it is meaning that if somebody pays for the course they think that they're just losing money and it's not possible for them to make money it's like a lose for them that's almost never the case almost every course I've paid for I've made 10 to 20 times that because of what I learned for example Udacity scores called intro to relational databases I remember taking that course and that course alone because I was already advanced this course is not for beginners absolutely not because I was already advanced at the time when I learned those key things from there even though I was being Udacity $200 a month I made like over thirty thousand dollars in just a few months because of what I learned and then what kind of jobs I could do based on that course so just because I paid Udacity it doesn't mean that I lose it's like Udacity want and then I want as well so yeah if I start as a beginner how long god these questions are moving so fast I want to pay for the course but I'm scared how this will help me as an engineer not interested in being a developer F Kanako this course teaches you the principles of getting good at getting clients one and it teaches you how to create apps with Python you can use those apps and you can get more complicated with it and make it really engineering type and not go to the web development route so you can do that but yeah so that's what I would recommend and again 60 you have 60 days to return it if you take it for 40 days and go all out and try everything or you take it for 59 days go all out and try everything and all of a sudden you're like look it's just not it doesn't have that engineering aspect or whatever there's no guilt there's no remorse I don't ask you any questions I refund you because look your one payment isn't gonna really affect anything my main goal for you is to get the skills that you need for to make that transition as fast as possible to the programming field and I want 1 million people to become developers that's one of my goals you know like one of the reasons okay one of the other reasons that I do this is because my dad is really old and my mom is really old and they were really crappy planners so they really so one of my main one of my main main main goals that drives me all the time is I want to give them a really really good retirement and that's actually one of the things that kept me going the software development world and I push myself so hard and I'm much much much younger age so then I can kind of do that for them and they just have a ton of problems like health problems basically and I hate hate when we have to go to like these Cook County hospitals and if there's an emergency I have to take them in and we have to wait like nine hours I think I mentioned this before but my dad like got hypernatremia a super healthy guy played soccer his whole life and he kind of got hypernatremia we went to the hospital and what happened was a doctor would come in he would learn what was going on with him we didn't know he had a hypernatremia hypernatremia is when your sodium levels are really fatally high like you could die high so he was having seizures and all this stuff and it kind of happened out of Norris fit healthy guy who's old but he's healthy and we went to the hospital and each a doctor would come in spend 15 minutes with a playing catchup of like what the nurse said and everything he'd get caught up and as soon as he got caught up his shift was over and then like a new doctor would come in and then that new doctor would try to diagnose the problem figure it out before he did that he would get caught up with all the notes from the nurse and the previous doctor so once he would get caught up with all those notes his time was up and because of that my dad almost pretty much died because he nobody could figure out that he was suffering from hypernatremia because it's so easy once they figure it out they just figure out how to bring your sodium levels down and you're fine but they couldn't figure it out because they barely spent 15 or 20 minutes with him so I never wanted to be in a situation that could happen you know one of Michael's always used to say like I want to get you guys a private doctor that just you know even since I was young so those are some of my goals that kind of drive me past just like superficial stuff like yeah I'm young I want to do crazy stuff jump off planes go out with friends you know buy them drinks and all that but those are some of the things that drive me or like being with my family all the time or friends all the time without worrying about work and all this other stuff that's what kind of drives me let me ask you like what kind of drives you guys and what kind of things you know what would it mean for you if you have the ability to kind of work remotely choose your own hours your own clients and then have enough where you're financially like free essentially like what does that mean for you how much amount of money invested on going okay money in the font cool same as you cool partners lucky to have you cool I would make it rain that's a pretty damn good goal I'm all for that freedom success happiness I love that no ninetofive I can't stand normalcy lifestyle normalcy and being average is what kills me every single day and I want to run away from it more than anything I'd rather be the worst at something then be average at it can you take this course working second shift as a job like it is timebased at your own pace it's timebased at your own pace it's not a live course and you have lifetime access to it so you can take this course any time and the reason why I make this course is even if you're working second job and you're working on a second shift I teach you just enough and I give you enough practical stuff to get you going and help you start earning an income while learning Python as fast as possible so you don't have that pressure constant pressure that alone that you have a lot of other times when you're making that switch they're just like quit your job and then just do programming it's like I have a family to feed and I have my own bills to pay how am I gonna just quit my job and just do this so yeah there you go so it's possible for you to do this parttime that's you know one of the reasons I want to teach you the most practical stuff in the least amount of time click the link below if you want to get this course now or you want to check it out the link is below I think it's something like clever programmer to slash create apps with Python there you go what is the best place to find work programming many different places it depends where you interview or you apply for freelancing you can even look at something like upwork.com and then look for Python jobs but then the problem that comes up is how do I know I'm ready to apply there how do I stand out from the crowd and what experience do I need before I start applying there so those are the things I cover in this course as well once you guys join this course message me in the YouTube thing and tell us why you joined it so we can see what your reason behind this is and let me know because I have absolutely no way of knowing when anybody is joining god I hate that ok Shreyas asks are you gonna teach something here I'll teach you something when you're doing coding don't always do programming like on a keyboard before you ever ever ever start coding a problem or coming up with a solution to their project or a specific programming problem in Python Java whatever write it write it with hand and understand the logic in English or in the language of your choice understand that and then go from there I joined yesterday because I want to be able to provide for me my fiance and my future life I think that's what Cody says I totally make sense you know I love that what were you doing before Cody you want to tell that to everybody and tell us how what how do you think of the course so far because you've taken the course a little bit so tell us a little bit about it yeah and in the mean time and answer that question write it down in English understand it like deadon then start coding it it's gonna save you thousands of hours of your time and you're welcome cause ease like the Jesus Christ lookalike you only pick up questions and answers them like a Family Guy there you go perfect description after your beginners course what course is preferred I can't afford your opie course there are a lot of videos that I have on YouTube and then there are a lot of yeah there's a ton of videos and I even have some sequel stuff fqo Academy stuff so there's a ton of stuff that you can start you can keep learning on YouTube Harvard's ethics course really good I game design graduated summa can't find a job in game so I figured okay so he graduated I think in the software of Albarn in games and he couldn't find a job that brings me to another point one of my biggest problems and again the reason behind asteroid clever programmer was I saw a ton of my friends college students who graduated and then they got really sad that they couldn't get a job because a lot of the times the skills taught in colleges are like the polar opposite of what in real world people are looking for when you're applying to those places and that's why you have a lot of trouble getting those jobs and then you wonder why do I have 30 40 50 hundred thousand dollars worth of loans so again you know my course doesn't need you to have a college degree or an experience and it just focuses on getting you going as fast as possible Cody says the course is awesome so far cause II will give you feedback in the slide channel and yep I do so yeah look at that so even with all the crazy that I'm doing I will give you feedback and or everything should i do ITR CSM college CS i hate IT computer science this is a way to go man I just enjoy it a lot you know IT has a future as well but I did IT and I wanted to kill myself every day I'm starting something class I want to know if I have college václav says I'm really think to sign up but it's a lot of money for me so anyway thank you for your videos it really helps if you have any questions let me know if you're on the fence guys you know ask me questions and ask me what's going on and I want to be able to help you okay so if you're if you are interested in looking into it if okay here's what I'm going to tell you for interesting you're not the verge of buying it alright guys sorry the thing is gonna start going offline quite a bit now because lots of people are getting this course and joining the course so I'm probably gonna shut off the live video cuz every time somebody gets the course I get a call and then I have this automated thing that I've coded up and programmed so it tells me your name and it tells me what course you just got so that's yeah I've automated it because programming programming is awesome yeah but ill it'll keep distracting the live event that we're doing so I don't want you guys to get annoyed by it you know what I mean but yeah in the meantime go click that link check out the course get the course here's what I'll tell you if you're on the fence get the course try it out and then you can again I can guarantee you're gonna love it you're but if it's not the right fit for you again I have a 60 day moneyback guarantee that's not offered any other course look at any other course on udemy or anywhere else all have 30 days I stand behind you know what I'm telling you guys and I wouldn't do I wouldn't tell you to do anything that I wouldn't do we're probably gonna get more clients will I be able to pick up chicks after taking your course absolutely that's actually one of the main things that taught us taught in the course by learning computer programming and then you know getting the jobs you want you probably have the confidence to pick up the chicks that you want man this this gets so deep do you accept paypal yes it accepts paypal I'm also a nice human being and I have a payment plan for you guys as well so you can break it down in three months if you can't pay for it once Bouguer thai i don't want to answer that question it's way too specific doesn't help anybody else Paul Garcia what was your question I'm starting to keep messing it up you yes you can pay using debit card I don't yeah you can you can pay it using debit card what type of Python programming did you do to make money game web app bug bounty web apps gaming there isn't a lot of money unfortunately are you comfortable telling us your income range that you're raking in at this point in your life at all the coding knowledge you have I will tell you that like last one or two years I've been consistently making over a few like a hundred thousand dollars so and that was when I was 20 and 21 years old so yeah that's what I will openly tell you guys what was the longest line of code that you have written on not a month a year um longest line of code and again keep in mind that I'm also working on my own terms like for example when I go to California and I'm going with my brothers or I'm going out with my friends to ski lift or skydive or whatever a lot of the times I'm declining clients so if I just want to go all out and when you can then obviously you can earn a higher level income so we'll yeah I I stopped doing lots of donations but it's actually a lot of fun when you guys did super chat before I think I used to have a lot of donation things because the channel was kind of starting out and now I don't want to do that I just wanna you know if it's free material I want to just have it be free and not have you guys worry about donating or anything but if it's a paid course of paid course if you still want to donate or you want to kind of support the channel because it is helpful you know because off of donations I'll get things like this beautiful microphone and then all the quality of the videos are great you can go to my patreon channel so things called like patreon.com slash clever programmer and then you can become a patron and then it's like a monthly thing no I'm not getting annoyed by your guys's questions alright so guys this is it I'm probably gonna take some more questions for like 30 seconds and then I'm out this is longer Thank You Omar Gomez for sending the $2 a really cool another monster for me um take a little very few questions guys I gotta run I gotta get going in the meantime check out the course it's in the link below create apps with Python helps you land clients you get lifetime access for this it's a nononsense practical Python projects and applications so you can start putting on your portfolio I teach you how to get clients where to get clients how to keep clients how you can make the transition to becoming a software consultant in less than three months and much more all of this cover in this course I sound like like a radio host but you know it is what it is it's true the link is below clever clever programmer to slash create apps width Python somebody please put it in the chat that would be great but the link should be in the description below unless something weird happen the next livestream I think happens to p.m. Thursday on Pacific time but I mean I kind of doublecheck that and then schedule it for you guys IDE sublime text when you're starting out I use pie chart but that's for pros this thing is like so nice you know it's very comfortable you guys should have like a nice comfortable chair so when you're programming you know you can do it like a pro yeah it's a great chair okay guys um anybody who gets this course in the next let's say 15 minutes you can email me and then we can also do like a oneonone but it'll be like 10 minutes or 15 minute call okay we can do it oneonone and I will you know if any questions you have about is this even a right decision for me do you actually think I'm too old or not smart enough to do this should I invest my time and energy with all the stuff that's going on in my family and all the other stuff that I'm doing is this a career switch that I can actually be making I will give you that call free of cost to you okay but if you join in the next 15 minutes so that will be one of those things that's like the bonus okay but other than that guys I'm gonna get going thank you guys so much for being here thank you thank you thank you so much as always I love you guys this channel is seriously wouldn't exist without you we are fifty five thousand subscribers plus strong and normally growing and let's get to 60,000 70,000 hundred thousand right let's do this thing thank you guys take care as always I love you and I'll see you in the next video
