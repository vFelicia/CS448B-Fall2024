02:22 - college degree and so we're going to
02:23 - touch
02:24 - a few points a few of the skills that we
02:25 - think are the most important that you
02:27 - need to pick up
02:28 - you know to actually land a job or even
02:31 - get your career started with programming
02:33 - so let's get into it guys

02:46 - let's go thank you man thank you so yeah
02:49 - man tesla
02:50 - twitter whole foods now is is owned by
02:52 - amazon
02:53 - which is pretty much a tech company as
02:55 - well you know you can order your
02:56 - groceries online and everything
02:57 - google as you know facebook instagram
03:01 - costco all of these companies hire
03:03 - without needing a college degree
03:06 - let's go yeah and it's worth noticing
03:07 - that netflix is one of the highest
03:10 - paying companies when it comes to
03:12 - software development which is insane
03:14 - yeah how much was the pay you you
03:16 - actually told me a little bit ago
03:17 - 330k dude they pay their developers
03:20 - which is insane
03:21 - that is and they don't require a college
03:23 - degree that's almost
03:25 - half a million dollars and was it to be
03:27 - a front-end developer
03:28 - for netflix yep yep that's right
03:32 - that's insane some people think you
03:33 - cannot earn enough being a front-end
03:35 - developer
03:35 - some people think you earn even more
03:37 - being you know a full stack or a
03:39 - back-end developer but it really does
03:41 - depend on what company you're working
03:43 - for
03:44 - so now with that in mind let's kind of
03:47 - go into this
03:48 - you know whole presentation i think a
03:49 - lot of value is going to be given so
03:51 - guys
03:51 - please pay respect to sunny and our
03:55 - presentation knowledge everything we're
03:56 - trying to share because it's really
03:58 - going to up
03:58 - all your skills so let's go into it yeah
04:02 - awesome step cool you want to kind of
04:05 - explain this sunny
04:08 - yeah so guys the first thing we want to
04:10 - talk about right is
04:11 - whenever we sort of jump around this
04:13 - sort of stuff have a why
04:15 - right and the way we're going to talk
04:16 - about how like finding your why today
04:18 - is know what your end goal is right so
04:21 - in this case
04:22 - on this channel we talk a lot about
04:23 - javascript as our main main programming
04:25 - language that we want to learn
04:27 - we're going to teach you guys and we
04:28 - also want to show you the possibilities
04:30 - when you are using javascript
04:32 - now here we have like three different
04:35 - options that javascript
04:36 - can bring you and what we want to focus
04:38 - on right now is understanding
04:41 - what you understanding the sort of
04:43 - possibilities that you can go into so
04:45 - one
04:45 - we have the ability to teach so you can
04:47 - see on the top right we have javascript
04:49 - and then we have the ability
04:50 - to teach with javascript and you can see
04:52 - that's going to be something where you
04:54 - can actually earn
04:55 - a bit of money very very quickly right
04:57 - so like
04:58 - very very quickly you can start earning
05:00 - an income with uh with the ability to
05:01 - teach
05:02 - the second thing we're going to talk
05:03 - about is the ability uh to jump in and
05:05 - handle freelance clients right so you
05:07 - can see this is something which is going
05:08 - to give you a bit more money
05:10 - and it's going to be a case of like you
05:11 - can handle if you can handle one client
05:13 - or 50 clients
05:14 - it's completely down to you right and
05:16 - then the final one is where everyone
05:17 - wants to get to and that's landing
05:19 - amazing jobs at google netflix
05:21 - uh instagram apple those kind of things
05:23 - and those companies pay
05:24 - big guys so just what we want you guys
05:27 - to sort of pay attention to is a
05:28 - while like before you actually jump into
05:30 - this video right now
05:32 - just have your end goal in mind right
05:34 - and he
05:35 - all of these things guys allow different
05:37 - possibilities the
05:38 - the final one landing a permanent job is
05:40 - going to give you stability
05:42 - freelancing means you can travel
05:44 - anywhere guys
05:45 - like you can literally work remotely you
05:47 - can do whatever you want to do
05:49 - and you can handle your clients as long
05:50 - as you have laptop and internet
05:51 - connection
05:52 - and the first one being the ability to
05:54 - teach is literally going to be something
05:55 - which you can start doing
05:57 - from day one so if you start uh coding a
05:59 - week
06:00 - you're now a week ahead of somebody
06:02 - who's never coded before so you can
06:03 - offer immediate value yeah that's even
06:05 - gonna go through today michael lecompte
06:07 - right he was here
06:08 - i think yesterday he was on a live and
06:10 - michael actually started
06:11 - getting a bunch of clients just teaching
06:13 - them how to code with
06:15 - i think it was c plus his one of his
06:18 - most strong languages and understandings
06:19 - of
06:20 - you can actually build a career out of
06:22 - teaching people
06:23 - and actually earn good income he was
06:24 - earning around 4 000 a month
06:26 - he's still getting clients to this day
06:28 - and scaling that business up while doing
06:30 - other things on the side
06:33 - amazing and guys we would honestly
06:34 - recommend that you always be teaching on
06:36 - the side
06:37 - so it doesn't matter if you are doing
06:38 - freelancing or landing a permanent
06:40 - position
06:40 - there's always going to be a room for a
06:42 - side income when it comes to teaching so
06:44 - amazing thing to know and bear in mind
06:46 - and the cool thing about teaching
06:47 - as well is the fact that you know you're
06:49 - earning money while
06:51 - learning even more so you're kind of
06:53 - engraving those those
06:54 - understandings really really well inside
06:56 - of your head inside of you know
06:58 - actually outside of you because you get
07:00 - reference experience of the people you
07:02 - know processing your information you
07:04 - have to refine your information once
07:05 - you're sharing it with others
07:06 - and that's going to make you even a
07:08 - better coder
07:10 - exactly we have loads of comments coming
07:12 - in guys how to
07:14 - my end angle is to become a freelance
07:16 - developer awesome ali malay
07:18 - nice my goal is to have boats you can
07:21 - have both
07:22 - if you do really well guys so like this
07:24 - is completely
07:25 - this is something you have control over
07:27 - nice i did want to touch on the fact
07:29 - that
07:29 - each specific journey that you take for
07:31 - example if you're teaching
07:33 - code or if you want to become a
07:34 - freelancer or if you want to get a high
07:36 - paying job at a tech company
07:38 - you know all of these skills all of
07:40 - these actual choices
07:42 - require different skills so for example
07:44 - if you're going to become a freelancer
07:45 - sometimes becoming a freelancer actually
07:48 - entails having a little bit more soft
07:50 - skills having a little bit more business
07:51 - skills
07:52 - you know sometimes people that look for
07:54 - top tech jobs
07:55 - might not have that that edge of
07:57 - business and that's why they might wanna
08:00 - build other things build bigger things
08:02 - and and you know that's kind of where
08:03 - their focus is at
08:04 - so i think personality is a big big big
08:07 - factor in
08:08 - distinguishing what journey to take what
08:10 - goal to
08:11 - have in mind huge massive massively yeah
08:15 - i mean like you get some developers out
08:17 - there who have all the technical skills
08:19 - but they can't really hold a
08:20 - conversation for longer than five
08:21 - minutes well they're very introverted
08:23 - and guys you do need a balance you do
08:25 - need a balance
08:27 - awesome yeah so we're going to touch on
08:29 - the number one big point
08:31 - and we feel like communication is key so
08:34 - suddenly you want to explain a little
08:35 - bit of the differences of styles of
08:37 - communication
08:39 - yeah so exactly guys communication is
08:42 - going to be one of the biggest things
08:43 - which is why we've actually put it as
08:45 - um the number one sort of one of the
08:47 - number uh the highest of
08:49 - skills that you need to know as a
08:50 - self-taught developer so interpersonal
08:52 - and non-social so we've broken them down
08:54 - into two different things right
08:55 - interpersonal when we say that we're
08:57 - talking about soft skills we're talking
08:59 - about like
09:00 - your time management your leadership
09:01 - your ability to work in a team
09:03 - all of those things are crucial to your
09:06 - success as a developer now you may not
09:08 - think about these things when you're
09:09 - developing you might just be thinking
09:11 - like
09:11 - about technical aspects and like um but
09:14 - do i just need to learn the language and
09:15 - that's going to be it
09:16 - but guys do not underestimate these
09:18 - abilities this is the difference between
09:20 - a developer is going to get paid like 30
09:22 - 000 a year
09:23 - to 100 000 a year literally a case of
09:25 - that like it's going to be huge
09:27 - right frankie definitely and obviously
09:29 - you know for you to be able to manage a
09:31 - team to work with a team
09:33 - to influence other people your
09:35 - communication skills have to be on point
09:37 - specifically if you want to become a
09:38 - good developer and you want to
09:40 - let your team know what exactly you're
09:42 - doing with the code
09:43 - you have to be able to you know present
09:46 - that in a fashion that people can digest
09:48 - so definitely interpersonal
09:50 - communications is
09:51 - one of the biggest aspects of coding
09:54 - that you can actually
09:55 - you know take into account that not a
09:57 - lot of people take into account
09:59 - now exactly i'm gonna touch a little bit
10:01 - into non-social communication
10:04 - so the non-social aspect of
10:05 - communication i think
10:07 - tech lead actually talked about it being
10:09 - anti-social communication
10:11 - just in general i did not like that name
10:13 - i was a little bit biased towards it
10:14 - but i feel like it's a very important
10:17 - point to touch just because
10:18 - you know it's one of the biggest things
10:20 - of non-social is
10:22 - talking through email making blog posts
10:25 - making
10:26 - actual things that are written
10:28 - crystallized because
10:29 - if you have a some sort of storage for
10:31 - that communication
10:32 - other people can actually access it and
10:34 - add to it and then learn from it and
10:36 - even you know make changes from it
10:39 - so that's exactly right and guys this is
10:42 - something which is huge when you have
10:44 - like
10:44 - let's say you you start a tech company
10:46 - right or you have you built a product
10:48 - and your product's amazing right
10:50 - like you need to be able to tell or like
10:52 - market your product and like why this is
10:54 - one thing i actually fell victim to
10:56 - i just i became so like entrapped with
10:59 - the
10:59 - the sort of mindset of coding that i
11:01 - literally forgot and i actually got
11:03 - really bad at the the sort of
11:05 - other skills like writing like and it
11:07 - sounds very silly but like
11:08 - coding is all about writing shorthand
11:10 - right it's all about writing
11:11 - short variables or like getting your
11:13 - code neat and concise
11:15 - and guys you need to remember like you
11:16 - need to keep hold of those other
11:18 - abilities in terms of like
11:20 - writing writing really sort of effective
11:22 - emails or effective blog posts or like
11:25 - even medium posts it's amazing not only
11:27 - to write like to read them
11:29 - i think it's really good practice to
11:30 - actually like incorporate reading them
11:32 - in a day to day but like also
11:34 - actually writing your own medium posts
11:36 - is really important um and i think it
11:37 - will actually benefit you a lot
11:39 - so let me ask you sony what got you out
11:41 - of that type of mind frame of
11:43 - you know having your head inside of the
11:45 - code too much and actually you know
11:46 - unraveling yourself to becoming a better
11:49 - communicator
11:51 - what was that so honestly but honestly
11:53 - failure
11:54 - failure was my number one sort of
11:55 - teacher through everything um
11:57 - i found like i just hit a wall right
11:59 - like i hit a wall
12:00 - so i remember i built a little product
12:02 - once and i was wondering that like
12:03 - nobody was buying it right like nobody
12:05 - was buying this thing that i built
12:07 - um and it just came down to a point of
12:09 - like i was
12:10 - sort of stuck in a place where where i
12:12 - didn't know the next step and i was like
12:14 - hang on i've done everything technically
12:16 - correct
12:17 - but like i feel like i've done
12:18 - everything so why is it not working and
12:20 - then it was only until
12:21 - i started surrounding myself with people
12:23 - like like carsi frankie aaron like all
12:25 - the guys
12:26 - and i realized marketing and that
12:27 - ability to speak
12:29 - to your customers and the ability to
12:30 - actually communicate with people
12:32 - um is huge right and not only that as a
12:36 - developer
12:36 - your ability to to actually have that
12:39 - side of the skill set as well is massive
12:42 - even with your communication to your
12:43 - employees or to your team members
12:45 - everything it really does make a
12:46 - difference so i think
12:48 - frank let's jump on to actual like
12:50 - what's the sort of soft skills
12:52 - and because a lot of people hear it
12:53 - being thrown around but we don't
12:54 - actually understand what that means so
12:56 - what are soft skills
12:58 - here we go so soft skills they're also
13:00 - known as people skills or interpersonal
13:02 - skills like we already talked about it
13:04 - and you know some of the examples that
13:06 - you can see here on screen
13:07 - would be you know leadership is a huge
13:10 - one teamwork is a huge one
13:12 - time management is really big too and
13:14 - obviously
13:15 - communication is all part of that the
13:16 - flexibility in your communication is
13:18 - also what's going to take you to
13:20 - you know do hard things like negotiation
13:23 - hard things like
13:24 - conflict resolution and things of the
13:26 - sort so
13:27 - all of these type of things are called
13:29 - soft skills and it is
13:30 - you know the skills relating to dealing
13:33 - with other type of people
13:35 - exactly and like this is usually like a
13:38 - good comparison here is comparing them
13:39 - to something like hard skills so
13:41 - remember earlier this whole talk is
13:42 - about pretty much why you don't need a
13:44 - degree
13:45 - and how you can succeed as a self-taught
13:47 - developer so in this case
13:49 - we tend to actually prioritize our hard
13:51 - skills so like
13:52 - how quick can we type um how good am i a
13:55 - programming language or do i have the
13:56 - degree or do i have a certificate which
13:58 - proves i'm good at this
13:59 - right but let's say you have everything
14:01 - on the left side right let's say you can
14:03 - speak like five languages
14:05 - you can code in like five four different
14:06 - other languages you have a degree
14:08 - you can type really fast but let's say
14:10 - you lacked all of the social skills
14:12 - let's say you couldn't even like hold a
14:14 - proper conversation or you can actually
14:16 - express your ability to code as a
14:18 - developer right
14:19 - that immediately cuts to your chances of
14:21 - landing the position or job or client
14:24 - jump like drastically you know because
14:26 - not only would
14:27 - work with you right at the end of the
14:29 - day yeah and
14:31 - exactly and you how can you build trust
14:33 - if you're not able to portray like what
14:35 - you're
14:35 - you're capable of what you can deliver
14:38 - all of that requires that communication
14:40 - flexibility leadership those things
14:42 - which are very much listed on the right
14:44 - and um something which was massively
14:46 - useful
14:47 - right so this was i think uh frankie
14:49 - have you read this book as well
14:50 - soft skills i've never actually i just
14:52 - heard amazing stories from it
14:54 - from kazi from you we actually met john
14:57 - sonmez
14:58 - as well so we even see it in his
15:00 - personality right that it's just
15:01 - something that's been integrated into
15:03 - him and
15:03 - also people from the company as well you
15:05 - and qazi yeah
15:07 - exactly and you know what that's a
15:09 - that's a really cool story that
15:10 - frankie touched on there so that's
15:12 - actually how like
15:13 - i watched a video back in the day where
15:16 - kazi released it about some books that
15:17 - you should read
15:18 - one of those books was soft skills and
15:20 - pretty much it opened my mindset
15:22 - as to like all of these the skills which
15:24 - you can pretty much see unlisted on the
15:26 - right
15:26 - and um that actually led to me
15:29 - eventually working with the clever
15:30 - programmer team guys
15:32 - so like don't ever take these as like
15:34 - skills that oh
15:35 - you know i can learn them later on or
15:36 - down the line these could potentially
15:38 - change your life
15:39 - like like these will affect your life as
15:41 - a developer massively
15:43 - and there are skills which take time to
15:44 - develop just like it does with coding
15:46 - and you should invest like that time and
15:48 - it's going to pay off
15:49 - like it will and this book guys it's
15:51 - called soft skills uh the software
15:53 - developer's life manual
15:54 - by john sonmez and i would 100 recommend
15:56 - that everyone
15:57 - goes ahead and grabs that book yeah and
15:59 - the thing is
16:00 - the biggest way that it's that soft
16:02 - skills are actually going to change your
16:04 - life
16:04 - is due to the fact that you're going to
16:06 - be able to communicate with people
16:08 - and people are everything man companies
16:10 - are made out of people you know software
16:11 - is built by people
16:12 - so when you do refine your communication
16:15 - skills then you'll build more
16:16 - relationships then you'll have more
16:18 - opportunities then you'll see what else
16:19 - to do
16:20 - so that's the way that it's that soft
16:21 - skills are going to change your life
16:24 - exactly exactly somebody said a book
16:26 - another book road map to freelance
16:28 - developer
16:29 - um oh no that's a video i don't know my
16:32 - bad it's a video
16:33 - uh okay awesome so you know touching on
16:36 - communication
16:37 - that really does lead me to like i said
16:40 - building relationships one of the most
16:42 - important relationships you can build
16:44 - is actually finding yourself a mentor
16:47 - so you spoke about you spoke about the
16:49 - importance for you right
16:52 - what was that you spoke about the
16:54 - importance of finding a mentor for
16:55 - yourself right
16:56 - can you tell me a little bit about your
16:58 - experience this was like
16:59 - game changer for me like honestly if i
17:02 - could
17:03 - if i could list like the things which
17:04 - made me a better developer from like one
17:06 - to ten
17:07 - this would be like number one because
17:09 - every time i was in a position
17:11 - or i was like even if i was freelancing
17:13 - i would reach out or i'd go to like
17:15 - these conferences and things like that
17:16 - and i would go ahead and actually try
17:19 - and find myself a mentor like whether
17:21 - that be a senior developer at the
17:22 - company
17:23 - whether that be like somebody who's just
17:24 - a little bit more experienced in like
17:26 - react or redux or something like that
17:28 - i would make it a mission to find
17:30 - somebody who actually
17:32 - was um like a level higher than me right
17:35 - and
17:35 - um that the reason why guys is because
17:38 - that is going to save you
17:40 - so many hours i cannot stress it like if
17:42 - you're all if you are new to development
17:44 - or like you're
17:45 - you're in that self-taught journey find
17:47 - somebody whether it be through facebook
17:50 - whether through the youtube comment
17:51 - section find somebody through stack
17:53 - overflow
17:54 - just find somebody who knows a little
17:55 - bit more than you and literally
17:57 - ask them just ask them because most
17:59 - people they just they they don't think
18:00 - you can ask
18:02 - when when in reality if somebody came up
18:04 - to you and approached you and said hey
18:05 - you're really good at something would
18:07 - you mind teaching me
18:09 - you need to think about it like chances
18:10 - are you probably would say yes so you
18:12 - probably would be like oh yeah i don't
18:13 - mean like this guy's gonna
18:15 - they're making you feel good and at that
18:16 - point you would want to learn and it's
18:18 - going to save you a lot of time and
18:19 - headache
18:20 - with debugging and a lot of other issues
18:23 - what's your thoughts on that frankie
18:24 - definitely man i think it is a shortcut
18:26 - to life to be completely honest with you
18:28 - just because
18:29 - of the fact that somebody else already
18:31 - put the time in to learn some skill
18:34 - so they have already invested a bunch of
18:36 - time and probably had
18:37 - so many failures in that specific
18:39 - subject that whenever they speak to you
18:41 - it's just going to be a huge
18:42 - shortcut for your experience as well
18:44 - it's you know it's learning through
18:45 - osmosis and one of the things that i
18:47 - want to add to that
18:48 - as you were saying it's it's really a
18:50 - reality that you can go up to people and
18:52 - tell them something like hey
18:53 - you know what you're really good at
18:54 - coding how about you teach me a little
18:56 - bit of your secrets of what you do of
18:58 - how you learned yourself i want to
19:00 - i want to kind of be in the level that
19:01 - you're at you can kind of approach
19:03 - things like this
19:04 - and i would add that you know offer
19:06 - something to them so
19:07 - maybe be like you know please teach me
19:10 - the way that you code and i'll teach you
19:11 - how i do
19:12 - wireframing because i'm a very visual
19:14 - person and i see that you're very
19:15 - analytical
19:16 - so always try to bring something to the
19:18 - table don't just ask for something
19:20 - always try to bring value so that you
19:22 - know it can be an equivalent exchange
19:24 - and that in terms is going to build a
19:26 - huge and a very good relationship with
19:28 - the person that is mentoring you
19:31 - dude that's that's actually genius what
19:33 - you touched on like
19:34 - the whole um thing about the ui like i
19:37 - actually
19:38 - sucked at ui right so i could do
19:39 - front-end development but i was trash at
19:41 - ui
19:42 - and eventually what i did is i reached
19:43 - out to some guy who was the company i
19:45 - was working for
19:46 - and i went ahead and said to him i was
19:47 - like dude like i can code and he wanted
19:49 - to learn how to code and i was like i
19:51 - can code but
19:51 - my ui is terrible like do you mind just
19:54 - giving me a crash course on
19:55 - you know you know user interfaces and
19:56 - things like that and um
19:58 - that's actually how like i managed to
20:00 - start building apps like
20:01 - the clones that we built and how they
20:02 - start looking the way they did because
20:04 - yeah like that's a really really good
20:06 - point that you made there like honestly
20:07 - guys
20:08 - offer some kind of value and literally
20:10 - it's pretty much a no-brainer at that
20:11 - point like they're going to enjoy
20:12 - like they're going to get something from
20:14 - it you're going to get something for it
20:15 - that's
20:16 - that's completely awesome and i love
20:17 - that you have experience with that and
20:19 - that it was actually something similar
20:20 - and if you guys are enjoying this
20:22 - content do like the video
20:23 - you know right now we got i don't
20:25 - remember his name he's from silicon
20:27 - valley
20:27 - but you know talking about the mentor
20:29 - talking about the mentor context
20:31 - so i think that helps you know if you
20:32 - guys find this this content valuable
20:35 - actually like the video it helps us a
20:36 - lot it really does mean the world to us
20:38 - because
20:39 - this allows us to share it with a bunch
20:41 - of people like you
20:43 - so exactly guys like smash the thumbs up
20:46 - and if you're finding value in this like
20:48 - it's going to help someone else find
20:50 - value from this so if you guys are
20:52 - enjoying it you know what to do
20:54 - nice cool another another great thing
20:56 - about
20:58 - being able to develop your communication
21:00 - skills is actually writing
21:02 - so one of the biggest right now
21:04 - platforms of writing in the on the
21:06 - internet
21:06 - is medium so medium is really cool just
21:10 - because of the fact that it's so easy
21:12 - going like you just look at articles and
21:13 - you can see how long they are
21:14 - in minutes that that to me adds like
21:17 - such a human experience to it
21:19 - and so it makes me actually want to read
21:21 - articles and there's articles of
21:23 - all types of things whether it be
21:24 - business programming
21:26 - anything in general we've seen qazi
21:28 - actually put up a lot of medium articles
21:30 - on very specific tasks
21:32 - about business and programming so you
21:34 - know even for him he actually uses it as
21:36 - a note taking app
21:37 - in a way so you know instead of storing
21:40 - it on your computer
21:41 - you're actually storing it on the
21:42 - internet so then you just google it you
21:44 - know whatever it is that you're trying
21:45 - to look
21:46 - for that you already made on the past
21:48 - then you have access to it
21:51 - exactly and guys think of it this way
21:53 - right like in the morning
21:54 - if you spend let's say 20 to 30 minutes
21:57 - just watching a tv show where you have
21:58 - breakfast right
22:00 - like for example look at the article on
22:01 - the right that's a three minute read a
22:03 - lot of medium articles are three to five
22:04 - minutes long like in terms of read
22:06 - you could fit about four or five
22:08 - different articles in while you had your
22:10 - breakfast
22:11 - now imagine you do that in a week and in
22:13 - a month
22:14 - and in a year like you're going to
22:16 - accelerate your development
22:17 - so far is going to be ridiculous if you
22:20 - as compared to somebody
22:21 - who didn't open up their phone and just
22:23 - check out a few articles and guys like
22:24 - this is going to teach you
22:26 - not only like what's new in the
22:27 - development world it's also going to
22:29 - tell you like the good practices
22:31 - the like the the sort of the sort of
22:33 - experiences other people had so that
22:34 - maybe
22:35 - maybe you can avoid those same problems
22:37 - that they've made
22:38 - it's also going to make you a lot more
22:40 - like lit like um
22:42 - better when it comes to your writing
22:43 - abilities because you're going to be
22:44 - involved in a lot more reading and i was
22:46 - actually somebody who was late to this
22:47 - scene
22:48 - um and it was only until like kazi
22:49 - really i sort of started seeing him like
22:51 - write blog posts and things like that
22:53 - like that i actually saw the value in
22:55 - that so this is something which if i was
22:57 - being a software developer now i would
22:58 - 100
22:59 - be doing a lot more and think about it
23:02 - too you know
23:02 - if let's say you didn't go to college
23:05 - and you built your portfolio your
23:06 - portfolio is great
23:07 - imagine how good it looks to show that
23:10 - you've made so many articles on coding
23:12 - imagine the authority that it brings to
23:14 - you and imagine the impact that it
23:15 - brings to others
23:16 - not only to you but to others you know
23:18 - and so even that helps your career
23:20 - tons tons and helps distinguish
23:22 - distinguish you from the pack you know
23:24 - makes you very unique because you're
23:26 - providing value to the world
23:28 - in your own words literally
23:32 - exactly and that guys who are we kidding
23:33 - like a resume and a cv doesn't do it
23:35 - anymore
23:36 - you need more you need like a media
23:38 - models or a great way portfolios are a
23:40 - great way
23:40 - a great way like that's just going to
23:42 - help you stand out from the crowd
23:44 - definitely so now we're going to touch
23:46 - on our second point
23:47 - our second must-have skill to learn as a
23:50 - self-taught developer
23:52 - and that is yep learning
23:55 - how to learn guys like this is something
23:59 - like as soon as me and frankie both said
24:00 - it like we both were like yeah like this
24:02 - is something that has to be in here
24:03 - right
24:04 - like learning how to learn so frankie
24:06 - let's touch on the first point
24:08 - about uh finding your learning style
24:10 - what do what do you mean by that
24:11 - awesome so everybody really does have a
24:14 - different type of learning style
24:16 - and so i find myself to be a very audio
24:19 - person i like to hear things
24:20 - and i also like to see things so to me
24:22 - those are i think my strongest ones
24:24 - and right now we're gonna dive a little
24:26 - bit deeper into that some people are
24:28 - better
24:29 - you know learning with other people like
24:32 - through osmosis some people are better
24:34 - actually with tactile type of learning
24:36 - which is you know touching the actual
24:38 - thing
24:39 - some people are better just thinking
24:41 - about it logically
24:42 - you know so you do have to find the way
24:44 - that you learn
24:46 - yourself so that you can actually go go
24:48 - at this the long term because
24:50 - let's say you know it's taking you one
24:52 - week to learn something
24:54 - because you're trying to learn it by
24:56 - just listening to it instead of actually
24:57 - looking at it
24:58 - and by looking at it you'd probably you
25:00 - know learn
25:01 - in two to three days the difference the
25:03 - time difference is just
25:05 - massive so that is a huge huge deal
25:08 - what are you exactly and honestly guys
25:10 - like finding your style
25:13 - is going to mean all the difference
25:14 - between like spending
25:16 - an hour effectively versus like just
25:18 - sitting there just like bobbing your
25:19 - head and wondering why nothing's going
25:21 - in because like
25:22 - even reading books right i i always knew
25:24 - that yeah reading books is a good thing
25:26 - i just can't for some reason i can't
25:28 - concentrate that long on reading
25:30 - right so then i found audible and then
25:32 - literally when i would go for a walk i'd
25:33 - go for a jog or if i was doing like
25:35 - if i was at the gym like if i didn't
25:37 - want to listen to music i'll just stick
25:38 - on audible
25:39 - and i'll just listen to the book and i
25:40 - found that was really effective for me
25:43 - right and that actually was when i
25:44 - started to be like oh holy crap like i'm
25:46 - actually taking this stuff
25:47 - in and then i found i was also a visual
25:50 - sort of learner so like
25:51 - honestly finding your learning style is
25:53 - going to be a very very important step
25:55 - and it's the first step before you
25:57 - actually start even doing things
25:58 - that i would recommend that you guys go
26:00 - ahead and like try and try and identify
26:02 - what works for you
26:03 - and what has worked for in the past for
26:05 - you
26:06 - definitely definitely i think it's a
26:08 - huge thing you cannot ignore it
26:10 - so i think you know go go to it right
26:13 - away
26:13 - right away if you're learning something
26:15 - if you're trying to learn a huge skill
26:17 - like programming is that requires a lot
26:18 - of focus
26:19 - make sure you're learning the correct
26:20 - way for yourself
26:22 - now you want to touch on time management
26:24 - sony i think you're really really good
26:26 - at this so i think it would be perfect
26:28 - for you to
26:28 - tell us your experiences with it yeah so
26:32 - i remember when i was at university like
26:33 - somebody actually said to me
26:35 - um and this is like again like it's
26:37 - funny guys that we're actually doing a
26:39 - talk up today about why you don't need
26:40 - to be in the university and i can
26:42 - 100 vouch for that because i've been to
26:45 - university and i just it's not needed
26:47 - like it really isn't so save your money
26:49 - and and do this instead like um but like
26:51 - somebody at university anyway told me
26:53 - about a time management technique called
26:55 - pomodoro right now pomodoro is a small
26:57 - technique it's a very very simple thing
26:59 - that you can implement straight away
27:01 - and all it is is essentially you take
27:03 - take 20 minutes or 25 minute sessions
27:06 - right
27:06 - where you focus on nothing but the tasks
27:09 - that you're working on so let's say you
27:11 - are writing a medium article
27:12 - you're going to focus 100 of your
27:15 - attention
27:16 - towards that media market for 25 minutes
27:18 - then you have a quick five-minute break
27:19 - and
27:20 - in that five-minute break you do
27:21 - anything you want besides work
27:24 - whether i mean check your phone check
27:25 - your notifications go
27:27 - go to the toilet fill up your water
27:29 - wherever it is
27:30 - you do that in that five minutes right
27:31 - you do that four times and then you have
27:33 - a long break
27:34 - and you give yourself a bit like a half
27:35 - an hour hour um and guys it's so simple
27:37 - to implement
27:38 - and i promise you like once you just try
27:40 - it out like that you'll just see like oh
27:42 - my god i can get so much done in 25
27:45 - minutes
27:46 - that before was taking me an hour to do
27:48 - and um frankie have you used pomodoro
27:50 - technique
27:50 - i use it a lot i actually use it for
27:52 - editing because sometimes
27:54 - i feel like when you try to push
27:56 - creativity like
27:57 - creative work it sometimes doesn't work
27:59 - that well
28:00 - a lot of times it does a lot of times it
28:02 - doesn't so what i have to do is kind of
28:04 - get into the flow of pushing myself to
28:07 - just say
28:07 - okay i'm gonna work for 25 minutes or 35
28:11 - minutes
28:11 - and then give myself a 5 to 15 minute
28:14 - rest and when i do that
28:15 - and i do that multiple times let's say i
28:17 - do that for like two or three times
28:19 - that gets me in the flow of creativity
28:21 - and like it lets my ideas flow
28:23 - so i use it a lot for editing i use it a
28:25 - lot for
28:26 - when i'm doing very hard tasks because
28:28 - sometimes it's really hard
28:29 - just to sit down and focus like that and
28:31 - i wanted to ask you sonny because i know
28:32 - that you have your master's degree
28:34 - and did you ever use pomodoro because i
28:36 - know you know
28:37 - managing your time during you know
28:39 - academic things like this specifically
28:41 - something as hard as a masters degree in
28:42 - computer science
28:44 - you know you have to be very aware of
28:45 - how you spend your time and then your
28:47 - energy and your focus
28:48 - so can you tell us a little bit about
28:50 - that yeah so
28:52 - really good question so like two things
28:54 - here help me succeed with that so one
28:56 - was being
28:56 - understanding that i was actually a
28:58 - visual learner so i ended up actually
29:00 - literally i surrounded my entire room
29:02 - with like pieces of paper with like
29:04 - notes and different colors and stuff
29:05 - like that because
29:06 - that worked for me and like it would
29:09 - force me
29:10 - like as i walked into my room as i left
29:11 - my room to stare at that piece of
29:13 - information day in day out
29:15 - and what i would end up doing is that's
29:16 - the first point right that was the first
29:18 - point was understanding my learning
29:19 - style
29:19 - the second one was the pomodoro
29:21 - technique actually like a lot of us
29:23 - suffer from procrastination so i do big
29:26 - time
29:26 - frankie do you suffer from
29:27 - procrastination yo i'm the king of
29:29 - procrastination man it's insane
29:33 - like literally you open up netflix and
29:35 - before you know it you're like five
29:36 - episodes into game of thrones and like
29:37 - five hours of your life and you're never
29:39 - gonna get that back right
29:40 - so instead i literally when i found
29:42 - pomodoro i was like oh okay
29:44 - like 25 minutes no is it really long
29:46 - enough for me to get anything done
29:48 - and like before you know it i was like
29:49 - crushing it i was all of my work was
29:51 - getting done
29:52 - i had so much more free time and it blew
29:55 - my mind because like you can literally
29:56 - actually spend
29:57 - a lot more time doing the things you
29:59 - enjoy because you're actually
30:00 - focused when you're doing what you're
30:02 - doing and guys i forgot who said this
30:04 - but like
30:04 - when you're eating right you are eating
30:06 - so focus on eating
30:08 - enjoy the food like enjoy what you're
30:09 - doing when you're coding you're coding
30:11 - so like focus on that
30:12 - but don't worry about other things or
30:14 - don't have your mind elsewhere because
30:16 - like when you are literally like
30:17 - concentrating and focus 100 on a task
30:21 - you should just be thinking about that
30:22 - task like if you know that you need to
30:23 - go and get food later on
30:25 - that's a that's a that's a task for
30:26 - later on right give your 100 attention
30:29 - in that 25 minute session
30:30 - and then when you get that long break
30:31 - then you go and get your food that's
30:33 - exactly right
30:35 - that that's a very zen-like type of
30:38 - teaching very like buddhist like type of
30:39 - teaching
30:40 - and it really does remind me of our next
30:42 - point which is
30:43 - you know learn how to handle stress and
30:46 - anxiety
30:47 - and one of the big things that you can
30:48 - do is actually meditation
30:51 - so i know sunny you like to play a lot
30:53 - of meditation music while you're doing
30:54 - your coding and everything
30:55 - can you tell us a little bit more about
30:57 - that what type of practices you use yeah
30:59 - what helps you so i actually use this as
31:02 - well while i was studying a lot so i
31:03 - used
31:04 - an app called so i did try and do it off
31:06 - youtube and i really didn't find like a
31:08 - lot of success in it because
31:10 - i just didn't the truth is guys it is a
31:12 - skill to meditate like it is
31:14 - something which you need to practice and
31:16 - you need to build like an endurance for
31:17 - being able to like sit there and
31:18 - meditate and
31:19 - actually try and clear your head is
31:20 - quite hard um so i used an
31:23 - app called headspace and i'd really
31:25 - really recommend it
31:26 - uh you can get on the app store android
31:28 - and ios and basically it's an app and
31:30 - you pay a monthly subscription and all
31:31 - you basically do
31:32 - is just follow the steps in that
31:34 - headspace and before you know it i was
31:35 - doing
31:36 - from 10 minute sessions to 30 minute
31:37 - sessions and why this was so good guys
31:40 - is for one reason it just gave me
31:42 - clarity it gave me clarity on my life
31:44 - like it gave me a carry on what i wanted
31:46 - to focus on
31:47 - it gave me that clarity as to what i was
31:48 - sort of stressed out about or things
31:50 - like that
31:50 - and whenever i feel that life kind of
31:52 - goes a bit haywire and crazy
31:54 - i just kind of turned to meditation and
31:56 - it really kind of
31:57 - serves as like an anchor and pulls me
31:59 - back in and um
32:00 - when i joined the clever programming
32:02 - team i found it amazing because frankie
32:03 - is actually all about meditation right
32:06 - so like frankie like what's yours how
32:07 - was your journey and like how did you
32:09 - get into meditation what are the
32:10 - benefits that you found from it
32:12 - and why do you like teach other people
32:13 - how to meditate
32:15 - man meditation to me was just insane
32:18 - when i learned meditation
32:19 - it was uh it was a way for me to
32:21 - actually i made it very practical for
32:23 - myself and i feel like that's the reason
32:25 - why i went very deep into it so for
32:26 - example
32:27 - one of the ways that i used it in
32:29 - specifically in programming
32:30 - i used to actually program android apps
32:33 - and the way i was actually telling sunny
32:35 - this
32:35 - the way that i would think about ui
32:37 - designs you know it's a very big
32:38 - it's a very known thing to think about
32:40 - your ui design in the way
32:42 - and how many clicks it takes to get to a
32:44 - certain menu to take to a certain action
32:46 - and things like that
32:47 - so i would literally visualize in my
32:49 - head you know how many clicks would it
32:51 - take me to
32:52 - get to you know i was thinking of
32:54 - developing a meditation app actually
32:56 - a binaural beat app so an app that you
32:58 - can actually listen to different type of
33:00 - brain waves
33:01 - and you know these brain waves get you
33:03 - to different types of thinking or
33:05 - mind spaces or whatever and i feel like
33:07 - you know like you mentioned headspace is
33:09 - actually a very good app that you want
33:10 - to use if you want to start meditating
33:12 - right now
33:13 - headspace is actually a tech company
33:14 - it's actually a billion dollar company
33:16 - right now who would have thought that
33:17 - meditation is that oh
33:18 - yeah it's a billion so who would have
33:21 - thought you know meditation is
33:22 - that popular man and yeah like i was
33:24 - saying the way that i used meditation
33:26 - was to visualize
33:28 - you know my journey around my ui design
33:32 - so i could literally design in my head
33:35 - and then i could put it into code so for
33:37 - me it was it was a very practical way to
33:39 - use it
33:40 - as well as you know stress and anxiety
33:42 - which is a huge part of coding
33:44 - when you're debugging when you cannot
33:47 - think of the right function to call
33:49 - all of these things man people don't
33:51 - normally you
33:52 - take that into account the psychological
33:54 - factors of coding
33:55 - but it's such a huge thing and i would
33:59 - really recommend everybody to go into
34:00 - meditation and start that
34:03 - exactly and you know what like it's a
34:04 - really good point you touched on like
34:06 - when it comes to coding guys
34:07 - when especially when you're self-taught
34:09 - and you're in that early part of your
34:10 - journey right
34:11 - how many of you guys can relate to this
34:13 - and like throw in the comments let us
34:14 - know like
34:15 - i have always used to feel that sort of
34:18 - pressure of like
34:18 - am i clever enough to code or like am i
34:21 - really like
34:22 - am i doing enough like i'm am i like am
34:24 - i cut out for this
34:26 - and like the truth is that guys like i
34:28 - wish like i just knew the answer to that
34:30 - like earlier on and the truth is guys
34:32 - it's completely normal and i've spoken
34:34 - to the most senior developers like the
34:35 - most skilled developers
34:37 - and it's something which is a normal way
34:39 - to fill and
34:40 - every single coder feels it trust me and
34:43 - like
34:43 - this is why it's a really important
34:44 - point meditation is going to help you
34:46 - control that stress and anxiety which is
34:48 - why we felt it
34:49 - had a place in this list we have a
34:51 - comment by a7gr
34:54 - it says hey sunny sub dude just want to
34:56 - confirm today
34:57 - these guys are crazy like they are doing
34:59 - a live streaming here
35:01 - while other coaches with nas are in a
35:03 - live coaching call
35:05 - just enroll in pwj so it's crazy man
35:09 - right now there's there's another call
35:12 - with the pwj group and nas is leading it
35:15 - so
35:15 - i mean that's the way that we do here we
35:17 - try to provide a lot of value to you
35:19 - guys
35:19 - we really push ourselves to our limits
35:21 - and you know it helps us grow so much
35:23 - and
35:24 - at the same time bringing that much
35:25 - value to you guys so we're really
35:27 - blessed we're really
35:28 - grateful for being able to provide that
35:30 - for you guys please drop it in the
35:31 - comments below if you guys are liking it
35:33 - and if you do
35:33 - like the video because like i said it
35:35 - helps us a ton
35:37 - exactly and also that's ahmed from the
35:39 - course what's up dude
35:41 - nice awesome so one of the biggest
35:45 - things
35:45 - as well that we can do as a developer
35:48 - and
35:48 - one of the biggest skills in you know
35:50 - learning how to learn is your ability to
35:52 - google
35:55 - this is huge dude this is so big and
35:57 - it's off every
35:58 - for some reason it's off every single
36:00 - list right like
36:01 - there's a really funny meme on the next
36:03 - slide this let's go check that one out
36:05 - and like
36:05 - guys this is the most like relatable
36:08 - meme on the internet right
36:09 - like it doesn't matter if you have 10
36:11 - years of experience when you code or
36:13 - if you're fresh like uh and you're just
36:15 - beginning a development journey
36:17 - like you are going to have to master the
36:20 - skill of googling right
36:21 - to this day people think like you just
36:23 - memorize this stuff like honestly the
36:25 - truth is
36:26 - you get yeah there is pattern
36:27 - recognition you do so you do seem to
36:29 - like
36:29 - um remember things through repetition
36:31 - and sort of you know like repeating code
36:33 - but the truth is that i don't remember
36:35 - how to write certain kinds of functions
36:36 - i mean i always forget this stuff or is
36:38 - it better that
36:39 - or is it that you become better at
36:41 - googling you know
36:43 - exactly you know how much like imposter
36:46 - syndrome is a thing
36:47 - like it's actually a thing it's like
36:50 - we're not sure if we're actually good
36:51 - developers or are we getting good
36:52 - yeah we love this meme yeah
36:56 - so good and like truthfully like the
36:58 - ability to google is going to
37:00 - benefit you massively yeah drop in the
37:03 - comments below if you've ever watched
37:04 - futurama because that's where we got
37:06 - this meme
37:07 - so hey moving forward like i was saying
37:10 - the learning styles is a very important
37:12 - thing that you need to dive into because
37:14 - like i said different people learn
37:16 - different ways so some people
37:18 - you know learn the bodily and
37:20 - kinesthetic way which is
37:21 - being more aware of your body some
37:23 - people are very good you know building
37:25 - things with their hands
37:26 - building tools building desks all of
37:28 - these things some people are very
37:30 - smart being interpersonal like actually
37:33 - you know
37:33 - communicating with others conveying
37:35 - their ideas with others working with
37:36 - the team some people are good at just a
37:38 - verbal language and speaking trying to
37:41 - articulate what they're saying with
37:42 - words they're very good cause he's huge
37:44 - at that i feel
37:45 - logic he's very logic as well i feel
37:48 - like i'm not so strong in the logic
37:49 - sense i think i can be but i'm
37:51 - definitely more
37:52 - visual i'm definitely more audio and
37:55 - actually i say this spatial too visual
37:58 - and spatial what do you think you are
38:00 - sonny
38:02 - you know it's a good question i feel
38:04 - like i
38:05 - i'm very like i'm a very i'm very visual
38:07 - right like i feel like i'm quite a logic
38:09 - logical person i like to break problems
38:11 - down and sort of go from there
38:12 - i feel like i am quite interpersonal i
38:14 - like to be around people but
38:16 - very recently i noticed i'm quite kind
38:18 - of uh i don't know how you say can
38:20 - can mistake like i like to be active
38:22 - right if i
38:23 - if i'm not active literally to the point
38:25 - where sometimes i'll jump on a call and
38:26 - me and qazi would just go for a walk so
38:28 - he'll go for a walk in l.a i'll go for a
38:30 - walk in london
38:30 - and we'll just talk because like just
38:32 - being out and being able to walk around
38:34 - like and this and that like
38:35 - it it's just it somewhat connects your
38:38 - brain like a bit differently like
38:40 - and even like they're like going and
38:41 - training every day or something like
38:43 - that
38:43 - it allows me to sort of clear my mind
38:45 - get back on and kind of align and like
38:47 - it doesn't work for everyone but for me
38:49 - it's a big deal
38:50 - yeah definitely definitely you have to
38:52 - dial that in guys
38:54 - know what your learning style is dial
38:56 - that in and
38:57 - go all in so now we're going to touch on
39:00 - different ways that you can learn to
39:02 - code so one of the most important things
39:03 - that you can actually
39:04 - research for yourself is coding
39:06 - resources especially
39:08 - if you're being a self-taught developer
39:10 - this is going to be gold for you
39:12 - so can you tell us a little bit more
39:13 - about these examples honey
39:14 - [Music]
39:16 - yeah so guys like honestly if you're in
39:17 - the beginning of your journey these are
39:19 - going to be
39:19 - huge for you so honestly the first one
39:22 - which isn't even on this list is youtube
39:24 - so firstly well done if you're here
39:26 - because this is like a first step in
39:27 - like using a free coding resource like
39:29 - it's going to be something which like
39:31 - you will help you grow and it's going to
39:33 - help you sort of like better your skills
39:34 - as a developer
39:35 - um these ones as well so on this list we
39:37 - have code academy khan academy
39:39 - code avengers that's interesting
39:41 - treehouse is quite popular so these are
39:42 - all places guys where they offer a lot
39:44 - of free content they do have paid
39:46 - courses on there
39:47 - but if you're just getting started off
39:48 - you don't have to stress about like you
39:50 - know setting up your development
39:51 - environment they just kind of have
39:52 - everything laid out and i'd recommend
39:54 - that you do go and check them out and
39:56 - just go ahead and play with them get
39:57 - started as a developer and sort of get
39:59 - the basic fundamentals
40:01 - going with using these things because
40:02 - these are built and they've researched
40:04 - the best ways to get it as easy as
40:06 - possible for you to get started
40:07 - so these are going to be really really
40:09 - good resources to go ahead and get
40:11 - started with
40:12 - w3schools is another really good one
40:14 - it's not on this list as well but that's
40:15 - really good
40:16 - yeah definitely so that's why i say you
40:18 - have to dial in your
40:20 - actual style of learning because because
40:22 - each company does have a different style
40:24 - of teaching as well you know here in
40:25 - clever programmer we try to keep things
40:27 - very fun very engaged
40:29 - so if that's your style of learning you
40:31 - know do
40:32 - actually join one of the courses that we
40:34 - have here we even have free courses we
40:36 - have paid courses
40:36 - everything i'd say you know whether it's
40:39 - our company or any other company
40:41 - you know put a little bit of skin in the
40:42 - game and actually if you
40:44 - deeply want to learn this skill pay for
40:46 - it because once you pay for something it
40:48 - just makes it that much more serious you
40:50 - know
40:50 - if you're just getting free content your
40:53 - whole life
40:54 - it's going to be very hard for you to
40:55 - dive super deep into you know
40:57 - an eight-hour tutorial 11-hour tutorial
40:59 - 12-hour tutorial
41:00 - that you have to follow just because you
41:03 - know but if you actually paid for it man
41:05 - you're gonna want to have that roi back
41:07 - so you know even that is leverage
41:09 - even even knowing that you learn with a
41:11 - little bit of pressure
41:13 - on your on your belly on your back you
41:14 - know makes you
41:17 - learn that much more it makes you
41:18 - understand that that can be your style
41:20 - of learning as well
41:22 - exactly and guys this is something which
41:24 - i would really like
41:26 - add on to what frankie said that like
41:28 - really really do
41:29 - like focus on like investing in yourself
41:32 - like if i asked you today like
41:34 - would you pay like 500 to go on holiday
41:37 - like
41:38 - most people would say hell yeah like
41:39 - where we going to fly to you right but
41:41 - if i said to you
41:42 - would you pay 500 in yourself to
41:44 - literally change your life so that you
41:46 - can make more money and go on as many
41:48 - holidays as you want
41:49 - then it becomes a completely different
41:51 - question right and most people will be
41:52 - like oh
41:53 - i don't really know but then they want
41:55 - the end result right so remember what we
41:57 - said in the beginning focus on your end
41:58 - goal
41:59 - first and then figure out how to get
42:01 - there right so in this case
42:03 - investing in yourself is going to be one
42:04 - of the most crucial things that you can
42:06 - do
42:06 - and like guys we do offer a course
42:08 - called profit with javascript which fits
42:09 - in here perfectly
42:11 - um and it does teach you a lot of things
42:12 - so i would recommend you use the code
42:14 - the free resources out there
42:16 - on the channel we have a bunch of free
42:18 - stuff on um which will literally help
42:20 - you get started and and get going
42:22 - and then if you do feel like you want to
42:23 - take it to the next level
42:25 - be sure to check out profit with
42:26 - javascript there is a link in the
42:27 - description if you guys want to go check
42:29 - it out um
42:30 - and pretty much yeah you can pretty much
42:32 - go from beginner
42:33 - all the way to your end end goal like we
42:36 - spoke about in the beginning
42:37 - definitely man even adding to what you
42:39 - said about investing in yourself i feel
42:41 - like that
42:41 - actually is a habit and once you start
42:44 - doing that more and more and more
42:45 - it's like you're actually betting on
42:47 - yourself you're actually believing in
42:49 - yourself so
42:50 - you start kind of framing your mind in a
42:51 - certain sense that
42:53 - now you believe that you will take
42:55 - action on the things that you do that
42:57 - now
42:57 - you're actually gonna bet on yourself
43:00 - because
43:00 - you do see yourself following through
43:03 - all the way
43:04 - and i feel like that's that's a huge an
43:06 - important point to touch if you're gonna
43:07 - be a self-taught programmer
43:09 - another big point that i do want to
43:10 - touch on is actually
43:12 - optimizing your workflow because you
43:15 - know if you don't want to be the most
43:16 - productive that you can be with the time
43:17 - that you have you know
43:19 - everybody has 24 hours in a day the only
43:21 - difference is everybody manages their
43:23 - time different
43:23 - and so if you're able to actually you
43:26 - know work with the specific tools that
43:28 - can help you
43:29 - either you know make your workflow
43:31 - faster either
43:32 - share what you're doing with your team
43:34 - or you know just
43:35 - moving files around these are some of
43:37 - the tools that we ourselves in clever
43:39 - programmer as a team
43:40 - internally use can you explain some of
43:42 - these sonny
43:44 - yeah so it's an interesting story so
43:45 - frankie and the guys got me started with
43:47 - a bunch of these tools so i wasn't
43:49 - actually using alfred before i was using
43:50 - spotlight just
43:51 - the built-in apple thing um and like
43:54 - alfred is the middle guy with the hat so
43:55 - it's actually
43:56 - uh i only found out today the reason why
43:58 - it's called alfred
43:59 - is why frankie it's funny it's funny i
44:02 - told yeah i told him today um
44:04 - and i actually saw the name and i'm like
44:06 - wow isn't that batman's butler
44:08 - and yeah that's everything that's right
44:09 - what it is
44:11 - yeah man and i was like so cool because
44:13 - like go ahead
44:14 - yeah i was just gonna say because
44:17 - literally because alfred guys it's like
44:19 - it's so
44:19 - powerful like literally to the point
44:21 - where there's a really handy feature on
44:23 - alfred
44:24 - where i've got it hooked up to command
44:26 - spacebar so it literally pops up on the
44:27 - screen
44:28 - but i if you like on alfred if you pay
44:30 - for the sort of booster pack which is
44:31 - only i think it's like 10
44:33 - or something but like once you have that
44:35 - literally every time you copy
44:37 - like a piece of text right it will
44:39 - literally keep track of
44:40 - like the last three months worth of your
44:42 - copied contents
44:43 - which is huge i can literally never have
44:45 - to like remember things anymore
44:47 - it's insane yeah man i love that like
44:50 - even if you're
44:51 - you know you have a snippet of code that
44:53 - you need to paste
44:54 - for another project even if you know
44:56 - you're trying to get a specific line of
44:58 - code or even a comment or even
45:00 - you know anything a password or really
45:03 - you know
45:04 - a url link something like that utm
45:06 - parameters like we use a lot in our team
45:08 - you know all of these things are stored
45:10 - there for even three months or even
45:12 - i think even more man but to me that's
45:14 - one of the most handiest tools for sure
45:16 - alfred yeah definitely the next one is
45:20 - so the one on the right is really good
45:22 - it's something called yoink
45:23 - uh so it's y-o-i-n-k and the reason why
45:26 - this one's really cool guys it's
45:27 - literally like it should be built into
45:29 - mac like because it is all like even
45:30 - windows because it's so handy
45:32 - it's like a little thing that pops up on
45:33 - the side and you can just hold some
45:35 - files in there and then you can pull
45:36 - them out as you need them
45:37 - so definitely if you're interested check
45:39 - that out because the whole team uses
45:40 - your ink
45:42 - loom is a cool one for making really
45:44 - interactive videos
45:45 - very fast so there's no editing you just
45:47 - hit the record button and then you have
45:48 - a little pop-up with your face in there
45:50 - from the webcam and then you can just
45:51 - sort of talk through your code that's
45:53 - really good guys even for applying to
45:55 - job interviews
45:56 - because what's really cool like is you
45:57 - could send a resume to a company right
45:59 - but if you send a personalized
46:01 - loom video going through their website
46:04 - saying hey i checked out your website
46:05 - and
46:06 - it's really cool really amazing like i
46:08 - love all this stuff this is what i can
46:09 - do
46:10 - hey why don't you check out some work go
46:11 - through your work on a loom video
46:13 - like that immediately sets you up from
46:15 - the crowd like it immediately just makes
46:17 - you different
46:18 - it makes you sort of somebody who
46:19 - they're gonna actually pay a little bit
46:20 - more attention to because they've gone
46:22 - out of your way to do that
46:23 - the final one which isn't on here guys
46:25 - is actually um
46:27 - setting up your coding environment so a
46:29 - lot of people
46:30 - use something called visual studio we
46:32 - use visual studio code to actually
46:34 - get coding and get up and running guys
46:36 - personalize it optimize it to be
46:38 - like your playground because that's
46:40 - where you're going to spend all your
46:41 - time learning
46:42 - right so prettier is a really good
46:43 - extension i'd recommend vs live share
46:46 - so you compare program with people is
46:47 - amazing me and qazi
46:49 - me and uh and aaron and kazzy like
46:51 - literally everyone on the on the team
46:53 - has used vs code liveshare
46:54 - to pair program like in a google doc
46:56 - right um
46:57 - there's so many handy plugins and stuff
46:59 - like that because optimize it so that
47:01 - you have fun
47:02 - while you do it and i can see a lot of
47:03 - questions about like how can i stay
47:05 - motivated how can i
47:07 - like keep like how can i keep my
47:08 - motivation levels higher like mohammed
47:10 - dawud hamid
47:11 - asked how do i stay motivated to code
47:13 - and guys truthfully motivation
47:15 - and this is something which i think
47:16 - frankie would agree on like motivation
47:18 - will always come down right
47:20 - like there's going to be like when you
47:21 - start your journey motivation is going
47:22 - to be skyrocketed it's going to be so
47:24 - high
47:25 - but like your discipline is what you
47:27 - have to focus on and build
47:29 - right and like building that is going to
47:32 - be your crucial thing
47:33 - as to succeeding as a self-taught
47:34 - developer but your motivation
47:37 - like what sort of a little hack i use to
47:39 - keep my motivation high is just make my
47:41 - whole workflow fun
47:42 - like if your workflow is fun you enjoy
47:44 - what you do and if you enjoy what you do
47:46 - it's easy to do
47:48 - man if you're playing the long term game
47:50 - you definitely have to make it a little
47:51 - bit pleasant for you because
47:53 - if you're feeling discomfort all the
47:55 - time it's gonna be
47:56 - it's gonna obstruct you from actually
47:58 - you know getting the things done
48:00 - like you want them to so you know
48:02 - actually
48:03 - making your workspace flow a little bit
48:06 - better
48:07 - it's gonna save years not even just that
48:10 - just your emotion your energy is gonna
48:13 - go through the roof
48:14 - so that's a huge point that we like to
48:16 - touch here and one of the last tools
48:18 - that we forgot to touch on
48:20 - is actually rocket and this is rocket
48:23 - this is for mac there's obviously
48:25 - equivalents for windows as well rocket
48:27 - is cool because i feel like it gives a
48:28 - very human
48:30 - touch to text you know we're talking in
48:32 - computers a lot so if you're able to put
48:34 - emojis here and there it actually
48:36 - conveys a lot of you know data just
48:38 - visually
48:39 - in text so that's an addition to it
48:41 - definitely
48:43 - yeah rocky guys just to be clear is a
48:45 - way of just adding emojis into your text
48:47 - in a really like easy way so you just do
48:49 - colon and then you get like
48:50 - you type in what you want and it'll pop
48:51 - an emoji on the screen so really really
48:53 - human sort of thing which actually makes
48:55 - a big difference when you're
48:56 - you're doing a lot of sort of people to
48:58 - people conversations
49:00 - yeah we use it with our ads we use it
49:01 - when we're taking notes that we share
49:03 - internally on the team all of this
49:05 - this takes me to actually another big
49:07 - part of learning to learn
49:09 - is gonna be a huge huge huge thing for
49:12 - programming in general for programming
49:14 - interviews for
49:16 - literally the academic side of
49:17 - programming and that is going to be
49:20 - data structures and algorithms guys so
49:23 - data structures in my opinion are the
49:25 - ones that you should focus a lot of your
49:27 - time around because it's
49:28 - practically what is going to be
49:30 - important for
49:31 - most scenarios but if you do want to
49:34 - kind of go the route of sort of going
49:35 - for like fine companies like google
49:37 - netflix
49:38 - amazon they are going to test you on
49:41 - algorithms because it's all about
49:42 - optimization and efficient efficiency
49:45 - so like that's like binary search three
49:46 - algorithms that sort of stuff
49:48 - now me personally i actually don't dive
49:51 - too far into algorithms i kind of just
49:53 - focus on
49:54 - mastering data structures and what i
49:55 - need in what situations
49:57 - frankie what's your thoughts on this
49:58 - like data structures versus algorithms
50:00 - yeah man data structures really do
50:02 - dictate the way that you're gonna code
50:04 - so for example if you're thinking about
50:06 - maybe you know searching through a list
50:09 - that you don't want any repetitions you
50:10 - might use a hash map if you're using
50:12 - java
50:13 - or you know if you're trying to traverse
50:16 - through a linked list
50:17 - and you know you're going to through a
50:19 - list then you might want to use a
50:21 - certain
50:22 - type of algorithm that i don't know it
50:24 - can be like a dividing conquer algorithm
50:26 - or something related to that but really
50:28 - you know the data structure that you use
50:29 - is going to dictate the code
50:30 - that you're going to use it's it gives
50:32 - that's why it's called data structure
50:34 - because it is the structure of data you
50:36 - know at the end of the
50:39 - i day never dove too too deep into this
50:42 - to these two categories the farthest
50:45 - that i learned is really traversing
50:46 - through linked lists and actually
50:48 - you know binary trees and seeing how
50:51 - algorithms work
50:51 - they're actually not as hard as people
50:53 - make him out to be and they're actually
50:55 - very very visual and it's what a lot of
50:57 - people don't sometimes pick up
51:00 - yeah and just to sort of pop a bubble
51:02 - here like
51:03 - guys it's like a big elephant in the
51:05 - room whenever we mention the word
51:06 - algorithms because whenever i used to
51:08 - algorithms i was like oh algorithm
51:09 - sounds cool it's like i want to learn
51:10 - how to use like
51:11 - make algorithms or write algorithms all
51:13 - algorithms are
51:15 - are a sequence of steps literally if
51:18 - it's like if you need to go to the shop
51:19 - it's like
51:20 - like open the front door walk out go to
51:22 - go inside the car put the keys inside
51:23 - the car
51:24 - it's literally steps that you're going
51:26 - to follow right same for the computer
51:27 - like i said it's a series of steps that
51:29 - you're telling the computer
51:30 - and then that's how you you're going to
51:32 - get it moving and then obviously you're
51:33 - getting
51:34 - different levels of complexity there but
51:35 - don't over complicate and honestly like
51:37 - don't freak out like we said
51:38 - focus on the data structure stuff until
51:41 - you really need
51:42 - the algorithm section stuff like because
51:44 - honestly even in my experience i haven't
51:46 - actually found too much of a need for it
51:47 - yeah
51:48 - so i would if if you want to sort of
51:50 - know from experience i would say focus
51:52 - more on
51:52 - the data structures um and that brings
51:54 - us on to the
51:55 - next point which is huge and i think
51:57 - it's one of the biggest talking points
51:59 - and that is
52:00 - what frankie it is debugging debugging
52:03 - actually debugging is might be one of
52:05 - the biggest biggest things in
52:07 - programming and it actually
52:09 - we were talking about this sunny and
52:10 - it's in my opinion one of the
52:12 - ways that you learn the best because
52:14 - you're actually troubleshooting your
52:15 - code
52:16 - you know you're realizing the you're
52:18 - back you're backtracking the steps that
52:20 - you did
52:21 - you're like okay this is connected to
52:23 - this if i delete this then this is going
52:25 - to happen
52:26 - and then you know it kind of gives you a
52:28 - whole symbiotic
52:29 - process of your code you know what is
52:31 - your take on exactly
52:34 - i couldn't agree more like guys like
52:35 - this is where like it's one of those
52:37 - things that
52:38 - you kind of have to like have
52:40 - conversations with developers and sort
52:42 - of understand that like
52:43 - it's a normal thing right it's one it's
52:45 - a normal thing and two
52:46 - it's literally the place where i
52:48 - probably learn the most when i'm
52:49 - debugging when things break
52:51 - is when i learn the most and like one
52:53 - thing i will really just need to address
52:55 - straight off the bat is i get a lot of
52:57 - like messages from like students and
52:59 - people who are
53:00 - who are sort of following our live
53:01 - streams which is basically about they're
53:03 - getting stuck
53:04 - and then they they spend like an hour or
53:06 - two debugging right
53:07 - guys be prepared when it comes to this
53:10 - and you just have to like be prepared
53:11 - for this like
53:12 - be prepared to spend hours and hours
53:14 - debugging or like even if it takes it
53:16 - like days i've spent a week
53:17 - fixing a problem before but i'll tell
53:19 - you one thing like when you
53:21 - you like when you solve that problem i
53:24 - can
53:24 - promise you that same issue will not
53:27 - bother you again in the future like
53:29 - because you would have spent
53:30 - hours and hours and days and days and
53:32 - that's literally where it
53:33 - really ingrains into your head as to
53:36 - what what was it that
53:38 - how did you fix it how did you identify
53:40 - the problem how did you sort of do it
53:41 - and these are things which
53:42 - then they can't always be taught you
53:44 - kind of have to go through that element
53:46 - of sort of like
53:47 - sitting there and banging your head
53:48 - against the keyboard but it's a normal
53:50 - process guys
53:51 - so like uh frankie what would you say is
53:53 - to like to answer those people who are
53:55 - like i can't code for like eight hours
53:57 - or
53:58 - like you know like you hear about these
53:59 - developers like even when we do live
54:01 - streams we're coding for five to six
54:02 - like five six hours at a time like a lot
54:05 - of people sort of
54:06 - they saw want to do that off the bat is
54:08 - that realistic
54:09 - not at all man it is like everything
54:11 - else in life any skill that you do want
54:13 - to learn you have to build that stamina
54:15 - and that endurance it's like running i
54:17 - love running myself
54:18 - i'm a huge fan of running just because
54:20 - of the psychological benefits that i see
54:22 - of it
54:22 - and really you know it's crazy man
54:25 - because
54:26 - stamina is so related to the consistency
54:28 - of the the consistency
54:30 - that you have that because at the end of
54:32 - the day for example if i stop running
54:34 - for three days just three days
54:35 - man it's gonna be very hard for me to
54:37 - run three miles but if i'm running every
54:39 - day
54:40 - like let's say today i ran three miles
54:41 - next day i can run five miles next day i
54:43 - can run eight miles
54:44 - but if i stop running even two days if i
54:47 - run five miles then the next day
54:49 - the three miles are gonna feel even more
54:51 - than the five miles so
54:52 - it's the same way with coding man it's
54:54 - you know if you are not used to coding
54:56 - for long hours and you wanna code for
54:58 - four hours straight your brain is gonna
54:59 - be a little bit fried so you're gonna
55:01 - have to take breaks in between
55:02 - and you're gonna have to build up to
55:03 - that exactly and it's all about the
55:06 - consistency at that point like
55:08 - focus on consistency as opposed to like
55:11 - spending
55:11 - hours and hours and hours at a time like
55:13 - the hours will come guys like
55:15 - having all night coding sessions that
55:16 - stuff naturally like sort of starts to
55:18 - happen when you sort of just like like
55:20 - frankie said like
55:21 - stick it consistently and day by day
55:23 - you'll notice that growth and you'll
55:24 - notice that you can spend longer
55:26 - debugging
55:27 - but it is one of those things which like
55:28 - naturally in the beginning it's one of
55:30 - those more painful processes but it's
55:32 - the most valuable thing because
55:34 - you will never stop debugging and that's
55:35 - the truth you will never stop debugging
55:37 - so
55:37 - you might as well get really good at it
55:39 - and that's going to really help your
55:40 - journey as especially as a self-taught
55:42 - developer
55:43 - um and and how you learn and uh this is
55:45 - this leads us on to the next point guys
55:47 - like
55:48 - debugging is one of those scary like
55:50 - processes right it's a scary process
55:51 - because sometimes you can feel like
55:53 - you're just hitting a wall and you can't
55:55 - overcome it so the one thing we would
55:57 - recommend
55:57 - is actually get inside of some kind of
56:00 - community right
56:01 - whether that would be stack overflow
56:04 - whether that be youtube or something but
56:05 - like get inside the community
56:07 - and this is where like we have an
56:08 - amazing like i just feel like there's
56:10 - like i just i'm yet to see a community
56:13 - which touches like profit with
56:14 - javascript because like we have 1
56:16 - 300 plus people and it's growing every
56:18 - day and like guys like
56:20 - if you get stuck in profit javascript
56:23 - like i i literally i can't even respond
56:25 - as quickly as some of the people jump in
56:27 - and help out a student or like
56:28 - it's amazing and like frankie you've
56:30 - seen this firsthand as well right like
56:31 - what's your thoughts on that
56:32 - man it's incredible to begin with 1 300
56:35 - people in a slack community that are
56:38 - super
56:39 - duper active like wow it's like having a
56:41 - village having a whole village of
56:43 - developers
56:44 - inside of one specific platform the
56:46 - thing is the most
56:47 - interesting part about it is that
56:48 - everybody has a similar
56:50 - goal everybody has a similar path and so
56:53 - once you're around people that actually
56:55 - you know
56:56 - are looking to go the same way it just
56:58 - it has this magnetizing feeling to
57:01 - towards you know moving to your goal it
57:03 - you see other people getting
57:04 - you know getting a job getting actual
57:06 - results and you're like
57:08 - that person could do it i can do it too
57:10 - i mean i talk to him a lot i actually
57:12 - know how he works i mean i think i can
57:14 - be in that skill level too as well so
57:16 - it's actually very motivational to be in
57:18 - a community like this
57:19 - it's huge man if you do want to stay and
57:22 - be a self-taught developer on the long
57:24 - term
57:24 - play the long term game you have to have
57:27 - to have to look for a community that
57:29 - works for you
57:31 - yeah and truth be told like i'm yet to
57:33 - find something like that
57:35 - like which is why prophet javascript
57:37 - jumped out to me because i was one of
57:38 - those people who guys like we've all
57:40 - been there we're scared to kind of write
57:42 - into that stack overflow that i'm stuck
57:44 - on something because
57:45 - stack overflow makes you feel so dumb
57:47 - sometimes especially when you're
57:48 - learning in your journey
57:50 - like it's one of those places where
57:51 - somebody will come out like you you'll
57:52 - write a comment saying i'm stuck on this
57:53 - and you literally have
57:55 - five developers tell you like you're a
57:56 - piece of like yeah man
57:58 - like literally yeah they're like shoot
58:01 - you down
58:02 - exactly like they'll just let you like
58:04 - go at you like so like
58:05 - we do recommend like if you guys are
58:07 - interested it's the first link in the
58:09 - description go and check it out because
58:11 - like
58:11 - if you if you have run into any of those
58:14 - problems that we sort of mentioned
58:15 - like we can promise you like we fixed
58:18 - that in profit with javascript like we
58:20 - we
58:20 - this is like the reason why most of like
58:22 - literally every single one of our
58:24 - students say it's worth a 10k
58:25 - coding bootcamp like exactly because
58:27 - they just see so much value in that sort
58:29 - of community itself let alone the
58:31 - coaching calls and everything else
58:33 - so many different really really big in
58:35 - different types of levels
58:37 - that are together in one place are
58:39 - actually just going to boost up your
58:41 - performance your ability and really your
58:43 - whole motivation to code
58:45 - and you know exactly this takes me to my
58:47 - next point and this is a huge huge point
58:50 - if you want to do
58:51 - become a self-taught developer in 2020
58:54 - now that everything is getting
58:55 - modernized everybody's going into the
58:56 - internet
58:57 - you know something huge is actually
58:59 - creating online presence
59:02 - can you talk a little bit about that
59:03 - sonny because i know that you yeah
59:04 - you're so consistent on instagram
59:06 - and you know even on youtube man yeah
59:09 - like is in this is something which like
59:11 - i wish i did earlier guys like i really
59:13 - wish i did like
59:14 - and qazi is the ultimate example of this
59:16 - guys like
59:18 - like build like a following right like
59:20 - and literally it's not it's
59:21 - if you the way to think of it is like
59:23 - most people that i see who are starting
59:25 - off
59:25 - who don't do this like the difference
59:27 - between those guys and the guys i see
59:29 - posting like daily
59:31 - and frequently about like this is
59:32 - javascript it's not because the
59:33 - difference is
59:34 - like it's a way of keeping yourself
59:36 - accountable it's a way of constantly
59:38 - ensuring
59:39 - that you're moving forward so like by
59:41 - posting new content every day you need
59:43 - to be creative you need to think about
59:44 - like hang on what can i post today
59:46 - and like it's going to force you to
59:48 - learn about what's new in javascript
59:50 - what's new in web development
59:51 - what's new what can i learn today which
59:53 - is going to be cool for everyone else to
59:54 - see
59:55 - and like this goes on to the next slide
59:57 - which is basically a case of like
59:58 - guys record your journey but like on
60:01 - literally say you got instagram you got
60:03 - linkedin you got twitter you got
60:04 - facebook you got youtube
60:06 - like and don't be afraid like there's a
60:08 - really like good video by garyvee and
60:09 - it's like
60:10 - just stop giving a about like what
60:12 - everyone thinks like just go ahead and
60:13 - record it
60:14 - and as a developer guys like i can't
60:16 - stress enough like
60:18 - record everything including your
60:21 - failures
60:22 - and yes like when i say that like
60:23 - include your failures as well guys like
60:26 - because
60:26 - it's literally going to be a case of
60:28 - like that's a moment where
60:29 - like this is where like we sort of
60:31 - remove the stack over for
60:32 - overflow problem because when you
60:34 - literally
60:36 - are able to go ahead and say like yeah
60:37 - i'm failing on this today
60:39 - like you'll be surprised about how many
60:40 - other people are failing and i
60:42 - was sort of stuck on the same issue and
60:44 - then you start a community yourself like
60:45 - you start talking you meet people who
60:47 - are like-minded and doing the same thing
60:48 - as you
60:49 - um well what do you what do you think
60:51 - about that frankie especially with the
60:52 - failures part because a lot of people
60:54 - sort of like a bit like whoa what do you
60:55 - mean like record your failures
60:57 - yeah man i think that definitely it's
60:59 - super important to document your journey
61:01 - like garyvee says some people
61:03 - it's very hard for them to start you
61:04 - know recording their journey just
61:05 - because
61:06 - of the fact that they want to create
61:08 - something they want to create a scenario
61:10 - where it might look good on camera but
61:12 - the truth is that the most
61:14 - the best thing that you can actually see
61:15 - on camera is authenticity is
61:18 - genuine action is is really what's going
61:20 - on in your life and the way to do that
61:22 - is actually just documenting your
61:23 - journey man
61:24 - i know for a fact right now chris sean
61:26 - is one of the
61:27 - one of the youtube channels that i like
61:29 - he's a smaller youtube channel
61:30 - and this guy really does literally
61:31 - document his journey if he's getting
61:33 - fired off
61:34 - you know from his work if he's actually
61:36 - getting another job he's being super
61:38 - transparent with this
61:39 - we we might have him on the channel soon
61:41 - enough uh shout out to chris shawn yeah
61:43 - but man the failures are super important
61:45 - of
61:46 - a super important part of your journey
61:48 - it actually gives a little bit of flavor
61:50 - to your journey if you don't have any
61:51 - failures man it's like
61:52 - you can't you can't really boast about
61:54 - anything you can't really you know say
61:55 - that you struggled because
61:57 - everything seems like a like a landslide
62:00 - from there
62:00 - so you know that really does take us to
62:03 - our next point
62:04 - which is develop a programmer's mindset
62:07 - so can you speak a little bit about this
62:09 - sonny yeah so guys this is a big point
62:12 - because it's literally like
62:14 - when we kind of go into coding right we
62:16 - go in very like with a naked mindset of
62:18 - like we just don't know what to expect
62:19 - right
62:20 - like and we just kind of assume like
62:21 - it's this straight path like it's a
62:23 - straight path and like
62:24 - you have a beginner in the beginning and
62:25 - at the end of that road you have like
62:27 - some
62:28 - developer position or a job or something
62:29 - like that and even at the end of it like
62:31 - when we starting off i didn't know about
62:32 - teaching i didn't know about freelancing
62:34 - i didn't know about any i just knew that
62:35 - maybe i'll get a job at the end of this
62:37 - but the reality is it's not a linear
62:39 - sort of it's not like a line right it's
62:41 - a circular sort of
62:42 - mindset that you kind of need to adjust
62:44 - to and this goes into like
62:46 - getting your attitude right like how do
62:48 - you stay positive and how do you stay
62:50 - motivated
62:50 - and like i said motivation is something
62:52 - which you're going to start off with
62:54 - super high you're like wow there's so
62:55 - much money there's so much just now i
62:57 - want to do this forever blah blah blah
62:59 - but then you need to be able to be able
63:00 - to build that discipline right
63:02 - this goes on to like your behavior like
63:04 - what is what are you going to change
63:05 - with your behavior like are you going to
63:07 - start like
63:08 - and like incorporating like a pomodoro
63:10 - technique to make sure that you keep
63:11 - yourself accountable and you make sure
63:13 - that you're like
63:14 - sort of doing you're doing your work
63:15 - when you need to do it and that leads to
63:17 - like actions right
63:18 - actions like when you have a problem are
63:21 - you going to sit there and actually act
63:22 - on it or you're going to just sit there
63:24 - and stare at the thing and sort of make
63:25 - up excuses and things like that
63:27 - right when you do that enough times it's
63:29 - going to lead to actually leading to
63:30 - some kind of result
63:32 - right that result could be literally you
63:34 - getting paid by a client that result
63:35 - could literally be
63:37 - um you landing a job right
63:40 - and then what happens is that when you
63:42 - do those things it builds your
63:43 - confidence right it builds your
63:44 - confidence
63:45 - your performance overall as a thing goes
63:47 - up and then again that goes into your
63:48 - attitude it makes you feel good
63:50 - so you see like it's this circular
63:52 - movement right and frankie i feel like
63:53 - you have some really good insight here
63:54 - especially when it comes to like
63:56 - the sort of the attitude and the
63:57 - behavioral side of things like what
63:59 - what's your take on that like
64:00 - what do you feel about this sort of
64:01 - developer mindset man
64:03 - attitude is everything man every
64:05 - attitude is i cannot stress that enough
64:08 - just because when i've seen things go
64:10 - grey in my life
64:11 - whether code is not working whether my
64:14 - job is not working whether my living
64:15 - situation is not working as cause he
64:17 - said i was living in my car
64:18 - for two months actually that was pretty
64:20 - insane attitude is what actually you
64:22 - know
64:22 - dove me to take massive action to
64:26 - change my behavior and you know what
64:27 - attitude really is
64:29 - it it's what's that word that i'm
64:31 - looking for it's contagious you know
64:33 - you contage you you actually it
64:35 - transfers to other people the way that
64:36 - you feel about yourself the way that you
64:38 - feel about life
64:39 - and man this is massively important in a
64:42 - team
64:42 - you don't want to be an energy draft for
64:44 - your whole team especially if you're
64:46 - doing a project that is that's as hard
64:48 - as
64:49 - being a developer you know let's say
64:50 - you're building a rocket ship just like
64:52 - daniel is
64:52 - let's say you're working in tesla
64:54 - creating self-driving cars
64:56 - you don't want to have somebody that's
64:57 - going to be a sinkhole of energy
64:59 - and your team attitude is one of the
65:01 - most important things because
65:02 - as sonny was saying attitude does affect
65:04 - your behavior and then
65:05 - action is really the byproduct of
65:09 - behavior and then your action really
65:11 - brings results
65:13 - so then the results dictate your
65:15 - performance you know
65:16 - so you know seeing
65:19 - that you're getting good results it's
65:21 - gonna affect your performance it's gonna
65:22 - give you
65:23 - positive feedback or negative feedback
65:25 - and you have to reiterate from that and
65:27 - i feel like
65:28 - being very honest with the feedback that
65:29 - you get being able to be part of a
65:31 - community or a team of people that tell
65:33 - you hey
65:33 - man you actually you're you're you're
65:36 - doing bad right here like you have to
65:38 - change this you have to
65:40 - reassess this because you're actually
65:42 - affecting other people
65:43 - you have to be very honest about you
65:45 - know what is in front of you
65:46 - and actually being able to take action
65:48 - on that that in itself is a huge skill
65:50 - that'll take you to become one of the
65:53 - best people
65:54 - you know in your community you're gonna
65:55 - be super influential
65:58 - exactly and two things that frankie
66:00 - mentioned there which were gold right
66:02 - one is like it's like it's it's kind of
66:04 - like contagious right that attitude and
66:06 - that mindset is going to be massively
66:07 - contagious
66:08 - so imagine like you have a bowl of fruit
66:10 - right what happens if you have one bad
66:12 - fruit and then it's like a rotten fruit
66:14 - it spreads right it spreads and the
66:15 - whole bowl gets infected and all
66:17 - the whole thing is no longer edible
66:18 - right so like that's an easy way to
66:20 - think of it right so what we're trying
66:21 - to move to is like
66:22 - you need to surround yourself with like
66:25 - positively
66:26 - like charged minded and like-minded
66:28 - people and this leads on really nicely
66:30 - and the one place that you can go ahead
66:32 - and find people like that
66:33 - is like developer conferences right so
66:36 - developer conferences are going to be
66:37 - amazing places where you can go and find
66:39 - people that are like
66:40 - not only that they're going to be
66:41 - developers there there's many people
66:43 - that aren't developers that are like
66:44 - business people so you might get exposed
66:46 - to different areas
66:47 - uh uh and different sort of things which
66:49 - you wouldn't have
66:51 - otherwise sort of exposed yourself to
66:53 - but like guys this is really gonna sort
66:54 - of help you
66:55 - um take your sort of skill set like for
66:58 - example if you're lacking
67:00 - in soft skills i noticed when i started
67:02 - going to conferences
67:03 - i massively opened up and i became a lot
67:05 - more extroverted
67:06 - as opposed to sort of being that
67:07 - introverted developer what's your take
67:09 - on conferences um
67:10 - frankie man i love conferences of
67:14 - all sorts that's how frankie and i met
67:16 - yeah exactly that's oh no
67:18 - that's cozy man yeah this is literally
67:20 - how him and i met and that's how aaron
67:22 - and i met yeah conferences were kings
67:25 - one of the things that i didn't want to
67:26 - touch on is the fact that we said we
67:28 - mentioned you know have an online
67:29 - presence
67:30 - do record your journey one of the big
67:32 - things we do in the team
67:34 - you know every time that we go to
67:35 - conferences we actually interview
67:37 - tons of people because there's no other
67:41 - scenario where so many
67:42 - like-minded individuals come into a
67:44 - place and not only that they're
67:46 - like-minded but the levels of
67:48 - you know their performance is huge so
67:50 - all types of people of each level
67:52 - are in conferences and so one of the
67:53 - things that we did last conference we
67:55 - were at
67:56 - funnel hacking live in nashville
67:57 - tennessee and we ended up
67:59 - having about three different interviews
68:02 - with people that we admire and that's
68:03 - insane and we would never be able to
68:05 - have those type of interviews
68:07 - in any other part of the world really so
68:10 - you know
68:10 - you do want to record your journey go to
68:12 - conferences
68:13 - meet these people and it's such a good
68:15 - way to start a relationship
68:17 - if you interview somebody you have just
68:19 - that much more connection because you
68:20 - guys have produced you know content
68:22 - together
68:23 - you guys have actually you know shared a
68:25 - bunch of experiences in front of a
68:26 - camera which is a very intimate type of
68:28 - thing you know
68:28 - even that helps you build a relationship
68:30 - with that
68:32 - exactly and we had a lot of questions
68:34 - earlier as to like how can i find a
68:35 - mentor or how can i find people like
68:37 - when i'm
68:38 - starting out as a beginner guys this is
68:40 - like the place to go to like
68:41 - honestly a lot of conferences are free
68:43 - like i went to a facebook one recently
68:45 - in london
68:46 - and that one was completely free and i
68:48 - met a bunch of cool people there
68:50 - and actually made a friend there who
68:51 - ended up helping me solve a problem i
68:53 - was having at work
68:54 - like so like the the sort of networking
68:57 - and the power that you're going to get
68:58 - from that is is really unbeatable and
68:59 - like and that was completely free
69:01 - so like if it's a sort of concern as to
69:03 - money like guys a lot of this is free
69:05 - and
69:05 - also if you're in different parts of the
69:07 - world you can actually join conferences
69:09 - like digitally and you can actually sit
69:10 - inside of like calls and this and that
69:12 - um and then like you you'll meet people
69:14 - in the comments section like it's really
69:16 - definitely something i would recommend
69:17 - that
69:18 - everyone is for developers especially
69:21 - right now with the whole covet thing
69:22 - going on you know
69:23 - right now maybe there's not a lot of
69:26 - conferences going on but like you
69:27 - mentioned digital conferences are a huge
69:29 - thing
69:29 - and actually i know for a fact nas is
69:32 - one of the people that would get a lot
69:33 - of roi
69:34 - in conferences he started working with
69:36 - us about in november
69:37 - of 2019 and he was telling us that a lot
69:40 - of his clients freelancing clients
69:42 - came from actually being in conferences
69:44 - so you know sparking out conversations
69:46 - with
69:46 - other software engineers or business
69:48 - owners you can offer your service to
69:50 - them
69:50 - try to solve their problems and really
69:53 - all of those things
69:54 - are going to help you massively and that
69:55 - really just takes me to my next point
69:58 - our next point which is
70:01 - yeah so guys like pretty much it
70:03 - revolves around the developing
70:05 - programs mindset so we have we've made
70:07 - like a few different points which are
70:08 - going to help you
70:09 - start and get and get on that sort of um
70:11 - path to doing that so one of them is we
70:14 - mentioned is finishing your projects
70:16 - now what we mean here guys is literally
70:18 - it's can this goes hand in hand with
70:20 - number two so mastering one language so
70:22 - firstly
70:22 - i think it'll be a good thing to
70:23 - actually explain that one so guys when
70:25 - you're starting off your journey right
70:27 - there's a lot of people that are here
70:28 - like should i learn this or this should
70:30 - i learn java or python should in
70:31 - javascript or
70:33 - or like c plus plus now guys
70:36 - whatever you learn like all i will say
70:39 - is that like
70:39 - uh we we've all sort of everyone on the
70:41 - teams coded for a very long time and
70:43 - honest like joint advice is literally a
70:45 - case of like once you know one language
70:47 - it's very transferable right but the
70:49 - thing is you need to stick to the
70:51 - language that you're sort of learning
70:53 - especially if you're in a beginner level
70:54 - stick to language you're learning and
70:56 - actually build your skill set up to a
70:58 - point where it's a sellable skill
71:00 - right build your your skills up to its
71:02 - first points it's actually celebrated
71:03 - it's actually useful
71:04 - if you keep jumping language and like
71:06 - you're doing java one second python one
71:08 - second and then
71:09 - you keep jumping around you're never
71:10 - going to reach a point where you can
71:11 - actually sell your skill
71:13 - right and this leads on to the first
71:14 - point of like finishing your projects
71:16 - so um frankly what do we mean here when
71:18 - we say finish your projects
71:20 - so a lot of people do have the habit of
71:22 - starting a project
71:23 - and just finishing about 80 of it i
71:26 - myself have seen
71:27 - myself in that situation a lot of times
71:28 - whether i'm like building an
71:30 - app or anything related to that i would
71:32 - see that i would have the ui design
71:34 - i would do the front end and i wouldn't
71:36 - finish the back end
71:37 - and i was like oh man it looks pretty
71:39 - but it didn't have any functionality to
71:40 - it other than just
71:41 - linking me to another page you know and
71:44 - the thing is that
71:45 - if you do develop that habit it's really
71:47 - hard for you to get out of it
71:49 - and the thing also is that you know
71:51 - you're creating a project you cannot
71:52 - even put it on your portfolio because
71:54 - it's not an
71:55 - it's not a complete project it's not
71:56 - it's not something that can be sellable
71:58 - like sunny was saying
72:00 - and you actually mentioned something
72:01 - really funny sunny um right now that we
72:03 - were talking
72:04 - about specifically mastering one
72:06 - specific language you know some people
72:07 - do dive into a bunch of different
72:09 - languages and they're like oh yeah
72:10 - i know python i know javascript i know
72:12 - java and i know all of this
72:14 - and then somebody in the interview is
72:15 - like okay book can you build something
72:17 - in one specific language and then
72:20 - they're like
72:21 - no but i know all of these languages
72:24 - it's like what is the point of that you
72:25 - know
72:25 - you cannot build anything so you're just
72:28 - kind of
72:29 - knowing knowledge to know it you know
72:35 - yeah that's that's right exactly like
72:38 - yeah literally guys and the one thing
72:40 - i'll answer here is that like
72:41 - if you are in doubt as to what language
72:43 - to sort of start or like what language
72:45 - do you sort of pick first
72:47 - what i will say is like a lot of people
72:48 - kind of go towards i don't know why this
72:50 - happens but like
72:51 - they go towards like the languages like
72:53 - java c plus plus like the sort of like
72:55 - oh because
72:56 - they're the more tougher or clever
72:57 - languages that people say right yeah now
72:59 - what i would say is
73:01 - throw that mindset out the window and
73:03 - focus on value driven growth and what i
73:05 - mean by that is
73:06 - what is going to be the language is
73:08 - going to give you
73:09 - the sort of most value and think of it
73:12 - in a sellable way right
73:13 - like if you have a client who comes up
73:15 - to you and says i want a website built
73:16 - it needs a front end on the back end
73:18 - literally javascript is going is an
73:20 - amazing language for you because why
73:22 - it's it's going to be very easy to like
73:25 - get things up and running as a front end
73:27 - you can also use javascript as a back
73:28 - end with node.js focus on that if you if
73:31 - you went ahead
73:32 - and started learning c plus plus cool
73:34 - you could probably build like an
73:35 - embedded little
73:36 - uh circuit board right now how's that
73:38 - going to help you build like a website
73:40 - right like you see what i mean like
73:42 - think about it in that sense and
73:43 - suddenly the questions start making
73:45 - sense yeah man a lot of people think
73:47 - that
73:47 - you do have to end up you know learning
73:49 - a super complicated language or complex
73:51 - language like c
73:52 - plus plus or maybe even assembly so that
73:54 - you can know how you know data is being
73:56 - stored or how
73:58 - how to actually do a bunch of complex
74:00 - things that how a computer thinks how
74:02 - you know circuit boards work things
74:04 - related to that and that somehow is
74:06 - going to help you know
74:07 - programming so deeply that you're going
74:09 - to understand other languages
74:11 - well enough well the thing is that it
74:13 - really is
74:14 - what are you looking to do you know if
74:15 - you're trying to build a web page if
74:17 - you're trying to
74:18 - go into maybe ai maybe
74:21 - something related to python i don't know
74:23 - you know it does require different types
74:25 - of skill set
74:26 - sometimes it doesn't require you to dive
74:28 - that deep as to
74:29 - learning all the nitty-gritty like sunny
74:31 - says
74:34 - very british logan mentioned a really
74:36 - good question here guys it says
74:38 - understanding that i challenge you on at
74:41 - least from a job searching standpoint a
74:42 - lot of job descriptions are listing off
74:44 - for three to four languages for entry
74:46 - level positions
74:46 - how do i find a medium that's actually a
74:49 - really really good question
74:50 - um it's a really really good question
74:52 - and it's true like a lot of job listings
74:54 - ask for like a bunch of different
74:56 - languages so how do you find the middle
74:58 - ground
74:58 - and what my answer is to that is like
75:00 - think about it from this perspective
75:01 - right like if you have a web development
75:04 - job and let's say the job is a react
75:05 - front-end developer or something like
75:06 - that
75:07 - in that job i do agree with you it's
75:08 - going to say like javascript is going to
75:10 - say maybe
75:10 - java for a back-end role or something
75:12 - like that or node.js or something like
75:14 - that
75:14 - like but then what what tends to happen
75:17 - actually in those job listings if you
75:19 - look at it
75:19 - deeper they're actually usually broken
75:21 - down into skills which have revolved
75:23 - around
75:24 - javascript so like um ability to use
75:26 - rest apis ability to use redux ability
75:29 - to use things like that
75:30 - and the ones that do list every language
75:33 - under the sun
75:34 - i can tell you now like if you actually
75:35 - go for the interview and like sort of
75:37 - speak to them
75:38 - it's sometimes it's literally because
75:39 - they've literally copied and pasted sort
75:41 - of another job listing and they've just
75:42 - modified it
75:43 - and sort of made it sound like it's a
75:44 - very sort of common thing as to like
75:46 - even when react first came out
75:48 - there was job listings saying five years
75:50 - experience in react
75:51 - which is something so funny because like
75:53 - react hasn't
75:54 - hadn't even been out for like a year at
75:56 - the time but like people wanted like
75:58 - like five years so like the point is is
76:00 - that like to get a middle ground there
76:01 - guys
76:02 - focus on one language and naturally
76:04 - you'll start to sort of build the
76:06 - stack or sort of your knowledge around
76:08 - the stack that the job positions are
76:09 - going to be asking for
76:10 - and then once you get a conversation
76:12 - going it kind of moves to a point as
76:13 - just show them that you're eager to
76:14 - learn and then the rest becomes like
76:16 - quite a sort of
76:17 - simple conversation to have yeah
76:19 - definitely and another
76:20 - great way to actually bring down that
76:24 - knowledge to something practical is
76:27 - building projects
76:29 - yeah exactly so yeah so yeah building
76:33 - projects
76:33 - there's an example of the netflix
76:34 - project that qazi and sunny built a few
76:37 - days ago this this actual video is going
76:39 - viral it's insane we were surprised man
76:41 - i didn't know so many people wanted to
76:42 - build netflix so can you tell us a
76:44 - little bit more about this project yeah
76:47 - yeah exactly and guys if you enjoyed
76:49 - like if you were actually here and built
76:51 - this project let us know right now and
76:53 - like literally a case of
76:54 - we just went ahead and like what i will
76:57 - say is that like if you're
76:58 - if you're in your early journey right
77:00 - and you're sort of beginning a beginner
77:02 - uh what i would definitely recommend is
77:03 - go ahead and check out the live sessions
77:05 - that we did
77:06 - because it really really was like
77:09 - there's so many like value bombs in
77:11 - those videos where we just go ahead and
77:12 - build projects
77:14 - and what we sort of taking away and
77:15 - leading here up to is basically
77:17 - like guys when you're new build projects
77:19 - and like we said before
77:20 - make sure you finish them right make
77:22 - sure you finish them
77:23 - so build the projects finish them and
77:25 - then guys what this is going to show
77:27 - is you do not want to be that developer
77:30 - who goes to a job
77:31 - prints out a nice a4 piece of paper with
77:33 - a list of skills on it
77:35 - and says this is what i can do because
77:37 - i'm telling you now like they're going
77:38 - to look at you and be like
77:39 - um okay but like where's the proof like
77:41 - can you actually are they going to ask
77:43 - you a bunch of questions
77:44 - and they will catch you out if you're if
77:45 - you're lying to them so instead
77:47 - if you have a website or project like
77:50 - the netflix clone for example
77:52 - that shows that you can use um flexbox
77:55 - that shows that you can use react that
77:57 - shows that you know how to use
77:58 - responsive designs and css animations
78:01 - all without saying a single word right
78:04 - so like have enough of those on your
78:05 - projects and you you don't even have to
78:07 - explain at that point
78:09 - they kind of throw the sort of list of
78:10 - requirements out the window they're like
78:12 - whoa these projects are really nice
78:14 - and that kind of does the speaking for
78:15 - you and it gets you the interviews so
78:17 - having a banger portfolio is actually
78:19 - going to really really be something
78:21 - you're going to need to invest in
78:22 - and invest time and i see a lot of
78:24 - people say like i don't have time or i
78:25 - don't want to investigate i don't want
78:26 - to spend that long on my portfolio
78:28 - well in that case you probably are going
78:30 - to be stuck in a loop of like submitting
78:32 - hundreds of applications
78:33 - because you're going to keep running
78:34 - into a problem of trying to prove your
78:37 - skill
78:38 - especially when you haven't landed your
78:39 - first job so literally i landed my first
78:42 - job just from having like
78:43 - a a project and a skill like as in a
78:46 - project and a bunch of things on my
78:47 - portfolio
78:48 - that i was able to demo and that changed
78:50 - it for me yeah guys definitely don't lie
78:52 - on your resumes because
78:54 - a lot of times they're going to expose
78:55 - you you do not
78:57 - want to be in that situation
79:00 - so another example of a good project to
79:02 - build would be the
79:03 - amazon project that you know sonny and
79:06 - kazzy built as well the other day
79:08 - so you know these guys are going yeah m
79:10 - for you guys you know
79:11 - these guys are really teaching you
79:12 - skills that are very marketable
79:14 - and projects that a lot of people want
79:16 - to build right now amazon netflix
79:18 - all of these you know even twitter even
79:22 - all of these huge tech companies right
79:23 - now are super poppin and
79:25 - everybody wants to learn how to build
79:27 - very similar projects
79:28 - so you know do stick around for more of
79:30 - the live streams that we're gonna be
79:31 - having the next days
79:32 - so can you tell us a little bit about
79:34 - this amazon project sunny
79:37 - yeah this was dope dude like this was
79:39 - such a fun one and this is blowing up as
79:40 - well like we're really
79:41 - we really love how how much you guys are
79:43 - loving it right now but this showed like
79:45 - authentication
79:46 - the react context api which is
79:48 - essentially a
79:50 - simpler form of redux which is like uh
79:52 - built in-house with react
79:54 - um but pretty much like with this amazon
79:56 - clone you could go ahead and you got a
79:58 - really beautiful visual interface which
80:00 - was responsive
80:01 - and then you can add things to your
80:02 - basket log in and then actually go to
80:05 - your basket and see a checkout page
80:06 - which updates in
80:07 - it dynamically right so this was um this
80:10 - was a really fun project logan says is
80:12 - that an emergency emoji inside the p tag
80:14 - you can do that
80:15 - yes you can actually put emojis inside
80:17 - your code and it does work
80:18 - um which is really cool to see but yeah
80:20 - guys if you do want to go check it out
80:22 - really good project bunch of uh like
80:25 - knowledge
80:26 - like sort of bombs in that video um it's
80:29 - it was definitely a really fun
80:30 - i couldn't believe how many people stuck
80:32 - it out and built the whole thing like
80:34 - like it was amazing to see that like and
80:35 - guys one thing i would say is that if
80:37 - you do enjoy
80:37 - those like literally the only reason
80:40 - that me kazi the rest of the guys were
80:41 - able to see
80:42 - those that you enjoyed it was because
80:44 - you guys tag us in stories you guys
80:46 - shout us out in your sort of like
80:48 - instagram stories and things like that
80:49 - so like if you do enjoy it
80:50 - make sure you keep doing that because we
80:52 - love those conversations with you guys
80:54 - yeah man and the reason why you want to
80:56 - build these type of projects is really
80:58 - because you want to put them
81:00 - put them on your portfolio right so you
81:02 - want to build a strong portfolio that
81:04 - you can share
81:05 - with you know recruiters with the actual
81:08 - employees that are going to hire you
81:10 - it really just serves even yourself to
81:12 - know what type of projects you've
81:14 - dealt in you know so building a strong
81:17 - portfolio is definitely
81:18 - an essential if you want to become a
81:20 - developer especially a self-taught
81:22 - developer
81:23 - and also having an actual website as a
81:26 - portfolio is huge nowadays it really
81:28 - helps you
81:29 - distinguish yourself from all the other
81:31 - individuals that
81:32 - just turn in a piece of paper that's you
81:34 - know that can get wrinkled that can get
81:37 - even stained
81:38 - make sure you have a website for your
81:39 - own portfolio
81:42 - exactly and guys if you do have a
81:43 - website top tip
81:45 - make sure you do what this guy did right
81:46 - here and it says matt farley.ca so
81:48 - he went ahead and bought a domain i see
81:50 - so many developers who have
81:52 - such beautiful websites but then they
81:53 - just deploy it on like the
81:55 - the default domain that they get given
81:56 - in like some services and it just it's
81:58 - like when you have such a nice portfolio
82:01 - but you don't link it to your own domain
82:02 - like it's one extra step but it does
82:04 - sort of tie it together so make sure you
82:06 - get a custom domain if you do go ahead
82:07 - and you should
82:08 - definitely build a portfolio of yourself
82:10 - talk um because that's going to be your
82:12 - sort of
82:12 - that's going to be your replacement for
82:14 - a degree guys that's going to be like
82:16 - your showcase that's going to be
82:17 - everything which is going to demonstrate
82:19 - why a company or a client is going to
82:21 - take you on and trust you with the work
82:23 - and trust
82:24 - you with that sort of responsibility so
82:26 - this is going to be everything for you
82:27 - guys
82:28 - yeah man i think it kind of looks a
82:29 - little bit ugly when you have a
82:31 - portfolio that says something like
82:33 - you know blogspot.com or like blog.com
82:36 - something that just doesn't you know
82:38 - have your own
82:39 - name into it just having your name yes
82:42 - in that url makes
82:43 - makes yourself a brand makes yourself
82:45 - way more marketable
82:46 - so that's a huge and important point
82:49 - another thing that we want to hit a big
82:51 - point
82:52 - another top skill and this is our last
82:54 - skill to hit
82:55 - you know to become a self-taught
82:56 - developer it's huge huge huge
82:59 - huge if you do want to end up landing a
83:00 - job if you do want to end up being part
83:02 - of a team
83:03 - if you do want to contribute to open
83:05 - source projects
83:06 - and that is going to be get
83:10 - guys get get get is something that you
83:13 - all need to know
83:14 - all right now like like frankie said and
83:17 - he i think he just summed up really well
83:18 - though like is literally a case of if
83:19 - you want to land a job
83:20 - if you want to work in a team if you
83:22 - want to contribute to open source
83:24 - projects
83:24 - you're going to need to know get now
83:26 - what is git it's something
83:28 - it's basically a version control system
83:30 - which is basically
83:32 - a way that like if you're working in a
83:34 - team or if you're working for a company
83:36 - they store all of their code in like
83:39 - something called a git repository so
83:40 - most companies will be using get
83:42 - if they aren't then probably don't want
83:44 - to work there to be honest like because
83:45 - it should be something which is a
83:46 - standard um and pretty much the things
83:49 - that you're going to need to know how to
83:50 - do are like
83:51 - how to create commits how to create a
83:53 - repo how do you actually clone a repo
83:55 - how do you branch and merge and things
83:56 - like that
83:57 - those are things which you're going to
83:59 - there's their skills which are yes
84:00 - they're very scary when you first get
84:01 - involved in it
84:03 - and i was very scared of learning and
84:05 - honestly guys in git it's very
84:06 - easy to think that you're going to break
84:08 - everything but i promise you like you
84:09 - can undo things in gear and
84:11 - something that i'd recommend is that if
84:13 - you're new and and you don't understand
84:15 - sort of or you're very new to sort of
84:17 - using git or version control systems
84:18 - maybe use like a graphical user
84:20 - interface such as get kraken
84:23 - so get kraken is a really good um sort
84:25 - of a
84:26 - git client it is paid for but there are
84:29 - free ones out there
84:30 - i'd really recommend if you're new why
84:32 - don't you just use a graphical user
84:33 - interface until you get comfortable with
84:35 - the command line
84:36 - um but definitely something that is
84:38 - worth worth investing your time into
84:40 - learning
84:40 - and this is going to allow you to do
84:42 - what um what frankie
84:44 - really is going to allow you to
84:45 - contribute to open source projects man
84:47 - and it's huge if you do end up you know
84:50 - contributing to open source projects
84:52 - because it's going to give you that much
84:53 - more leverage
84:54 - in an interview in finding a job just
84:57 - because of the fact that you know you're
84:59 - you're actually helping a community of
85:00 - coders make their software a little bit
85:03 - better
85:04 - you know and if you don't have git then
85:06 - it's going to be very hard for you to
85:08 - contribute to this
85:10 - exactly and actually i actually
85:12 - contributed to a a big open source
85:14 - project before
85:15 - is one quarter so we've used it we use
85:18 - it over at clever programmer but a lot
85:19 - of you guys might have heard of
85:20 - something called stripe
85:22 - which is a payment processor and i
85:24 - actually contributed code to stripe
85:26 - and when i did that it blew my mind
85:28 - because i was like i remember i was
85:30 - working on it and i was like
85:31 - yo like it doesn't they don't support
85:34 - what i'm trying to do right now
85:35 - and i was like but it really should and
85:37 - i was so confident i was like
85:39 - i was like no that i'm sure they need to
85:40 - have this i was using something called
85:42 - typescript which
85:43 - sits above javascript um and it didn't
85:46 - have the correct type definitions and
85:47 - things like that so i went ahead and
85:48 - added them
85:49 - and then i remember i submitted it and
85:51 - it blew my mind when it went inside so
85:53 - even to this
85:54 - day i get emails saying you're a
85:55 - moderator of the stripe repo and i was
85:57 - like holy crap
85:58 - like it really does feel nice to be part
86:00 - of a community and like
86:02 - loads of people use that stuff so like
86:04 - if you want to be involved in that sort
86:05 - of scale
86:06 - definitely learn gear and start
86:08 - contributing with open source projects
86:09 - really good way to find a mentor as well
86:11 - wow that's amazing man stripe is such a
86:14 - huge company it's a great company it's
86:15 - so
86:16 - it's it's interesting because it just
86:18 - grew so fast now it's a billion dollar
86:20 - company
86:20 - and i heard a statistic that even more
86:23 - than the more than 50 percent of all
86:25 - internet transactions in the us
86:27 - use stripe like wow what happened to
86:30 - paypal
86:31 - you know that's that's insane yeah
86:32 - that's crazy and so all of these
86:34 - all of these projects right here are
86:36 - open source projects that
86:38 - facebook does have right now publicly so
86:41 - react is one of them and we use it a lot
86:44 - and you know that's where we actually
86:46 - built the
86:47 - amazon clone and how we actually built
86:49 - the netflix clone
86:50 - that is kazian and sunny
86:54 - yeah yeah guys like and this is another
86:56 - thing like
86:58 - big companies like it's not just small
87:00 - projects whenever you sort of have open
87:01 - source projects you kind of think
87:02 - they're going to be small things
87:04 - right react react native like both are
87:06 - like open source you can contribute to
87:08 - them
87:08 - you can actually go ahead and like
87:10 - investigate on like a bugs or issues
87:13 - and like uh if you ever get stuck like
87:14 - believe me like people do actually reply
87:16 - and
87:17 - i can see graphql there graphql is
87:19 - another huge um
87:20 - sort of uh it's a massive weights or
87:22 - interact with your apis and stuff like
87:23 - that that's a huge skill that's worth
87:25 - learning for you guys who are
87:26 - self-taught right now and coming up in
87:28 - your journey
87:29 - um so definitely something to check and
87:31 - why are
87:32 - why is all of this so so valuable like
87:34 - at the end of this
87:35 - we mentioned five skills guys we
87:37 - mentioned like all of these different
87:38 - skills that you need to
87:39 - unlike know and sort of take into
87:41 - account when you're becoming a
87:42 - self-taught developer
87:43 - and the obvious end goal is to land a
87:46 - position
87:46 - or a job right so frank let's go ahead
87:48 - and show them
87:50 - what is out there and what the sort of
87:51 - potential looks like
87:53 - at the end of the road so for a
87:54 - front-end developer at least here in los
87:56 - angeles in california usa
87:59 - the average salary for a front end
88:00 - developer would be around 99
88:03 - 000 that is almost the six figure mark
88:06 - that is insane my man that's insane i
88:09 - mean with cash bonus that is a six
88:10 - figure mark like look at the cash
88:13 - you get bonus 3k bonus yeah and guys
88:15 - we're talking like
88:16 - massive benefits and for those of you
88:18 - who are outside of the us
88:19 - like i'm based in london like guys there
88:21 - is really no barrier when it comes to
88:23 - software development like you could be
88:24 - based anywhere in the world
88:26 - and work for like a u.s client you could
88:28 - be a base anywhere in the world for a
88:29 - london client like
88:30 - as long as you have internet connection
88:32 - and you have the skill set you are able
88:34 - to sell that skill
88:35 - right so it's something to bear in mind
88:37 - when you when you're looking at this
88:38 - like
88:38 - don't think that just because you're in
88:40 - a different country that like it doesn't
88:42 - apply to you
88:43 - it really does like it really really
88:44 - does and it and your skill
88:47 - your skill level is going to determine
88:49 - that so never write it off just put just
88:51 - think about you remember like we said
88:53 - get your why and understand what your
88:55 - end goal is and uh
88:56 - and focus on that and also what leads on
88:58 - to this guys is something like
89:00 - javascript so we said mastering one
89:01 - language right
89:02 - javascript is something which you can
89:04 - use on the front end
89:05 - and the back end and like let's go ahead
89:07 - and show you what back end developer
89:09 - salary looks
89:10 - like so look at that that's insane
89:13 - there we go back in developer salary yes
89:17 - as you were saying 121
89:19 - 000 a year this is obviously based here
89:23 - in california in la
89:24 - this is a huge huge huge type of salary
89:27 - and really it is a privilege you know to
89:30 - be earning that much money doing
89:31 - something as fun as coding
89:33 - and you know touching up on all the
89:35 - points that we did hit
89:36 - social skills soft skills all of these
89:38 - things are actually going to help you
89:40 - you know increase your income whether
89:42 - you're a front-end developer or a
89:43 - back-end developer
89:44 - you can now be and have the skills to
89:47 - negotiate your salary you can
89:49 - you know say the terms that you want to
89:51 - work in maybe
89:53 - you can say oh i want to work remotely
89:55 - and be earning a little bit less or i
89:57 - want to
89:58 - you know work in-house earn a little bit
90:00 - more or i just want to do these specific
90:02 - tasks i think i can be
90:04 - this valuable to this specific team you
90:06 - can now word out
90:07 - specifically what you want to do in that
90:09 - job and so that also dictates how much
90:11 - money you're going to earn in that
90:12 - current job
90:14 - so it's insane it just opens up
90:16 - opportunities for yourself
90:18 - yeah and we just showed you guys what a
90:20 - front-end developer salary is and what a
90:21 - back-end developer salary is but
90:22 - remember
90:23 - because it's like cross like javascript
90:25 - goes across front and back and you can
90:26 - become something called a
90:28 - full stack developer and in most of the
90:30 - positions where i've been
90:31 - a full it's been a full stack position
90:33 - so basically
90:35 - you can actually go ahead and actually
90:36 - be a full stack developer and you can
90:38 - even learn even more than this like
90:40 - so it's insane what you can actually go
90:42 - and do and like you can go from building
90:44 - an apps front end so the way it looks
90:46 - and feels to even it like building out
90:48 - the back end and literally being
90:50 - building everything from start to finish
90:52 - with
90:53 - with something like javascript so it's
90:55 - definitely something which you should
90:56 - bear in mind
90:57 - the potential is there is worth
90:59 - investing your time in and it is going
91:00 - to be something which will guarantee
91:02 - change your life if you put in the work
91:05 - that's right so
91:06 - depending where you are in the world the
91:08 - actual pay is obviously going to change
91:10 - depending like sonny said if you're in
91:12 - the uk if you're in mexico
91:14 - you're in other parts of europe if
91:16 - you're in africa you're gonna have
91:17 - different
91:18 - types of pace but the cool thing about
91:21 - the internet
91:21 - is the fact that you can actually get
91:23 - clients anywhere in the world now and so
91:25 - right now with this whole you know
91:26 - pandemic situation going on in the world
91:28 - a lot of people are getting clients from
91:30 - other types of countries
91:31 - and really it's a privilege to be able
91:33 - to live in a country where you know
91:35 - living situations are not that expensive
91:37 - as they are here in california
91:38 - you know sometimes that's why salaries
91:40 - are so high in places like silicon
91:42 - valley
91:43 - you know san francisco all of these
91:44 - places just because of the fact that
91:46 - it's so expensive to live there
91:47 - you know so if you can be earning 100k
91:50 - let's say in virginia which is a little
91:51 - bit
91:52 - less expensive than in california that
91:54 - you know that difference of
91:56 - living of the living expenses definitely
91:58 - goes a long way
92:00 - and specifically you know maybe you're
92:01 - living in philippines and you want to
92:03 - get some clients in the u.s or you want
92:04 - to get some clients in europe
92:05 - even in mexico who knows you know it's
92:08 - not that expensive
92:09 - relative to the us to live in some place
92:11 - like indonesia or maybe
92:13 - philippines and getting clients from
92:15 - other types of countries is really going
92:16 - to open up
92:17 - so many doors for you open up even more
92:20 - business and actual more experience man
92:22 - you're going to connect it's going to
92:24 - connect you to the whole world
92:25 - so that's one of the privileges of
92:26 - having the internet
92:29 - exactly and guys this is like the market
92:31 - this is the job that like literally
92:33 - leverages it to the max
92:35 - and it takes it to a whole new level of
92:37 - like taking advantage of the internet so
92:39 - definitely something to to bear in mind
92:41 - and um

92:44 - like where do you get started on your
92:45 - journey or like where do you
92:47 - where can you go from here like in terms

95:04 - want those type of you know toxic people
95:06 - around you especially
95:07 - trying to learn something as difficult

95:10 - because it might not be difficult but it
95:13 - does require a lot of focus you know you
95:14 - do have to put your heart into it
95:16 - it's not something that you're gonna

97:16 - great
97:17 - driver for a lot of people i know it is
97:19 - for me and it
97:21 - to me personally it's one of the huge
97:23 - the one of the biggest
97:24 - drives that i can actually put myself in
97:27 - so
97:28 - now you know we we thank you guys for
97:30 - being here now we're gonna take a few
97:32 - questions please drop intelligent
97:33 - questions down below
97:35 - so that me and sunny can actually answer
97:36 - a few of them
97:39 - yeah perfect and guys like like we said
97:41 - like i can see a lot of comments coming
97:42 - in where
97:43 - everyone's saying like uh makko watson
97:45 - says kazzy sonny frankie good stuff keep
97:47 - it going please
97:48 - guys we love you guys we appreciate the
97:50 - support and like if you guys found this
97:52 - valuable the lead like all we ask is
97:54 - literally just smash the thumbs up
97:55 - button because
97:56 - it will help somebody else find it just
97:57 - as valuable and it will help change
97:59 - someone else's life um and to be
98:02 - like for the better we have one question
98:04 - which we can ask in the meantime while
98:06 - we wait for some more
98:07 - it's by darren watts so it's just a
98:09 - little bit up um and it says
98:11 - just a req just a question regarding
98:14 - um the netflix clone that you guys built
98:16 - and posting it inside the portfolio
98:18 - we're not originating that code we're
98:20 - recreating what you guys create how's
98:21 - that viewed by employers
98:22 - so really good question and my take on
98:25 - this is essentially like
98:27 - like although although yes technically
98:30 - we are
98:30 - sort of like you're recreating code that
98:32 - we've done guys it's going to actually
98:34 - be a case of like
98:35 - it's not just as easy as recreating
98:37 - right like a lot of people do like the
98:39 - reason why people message is because
98:40 - they get stuck
98:41 - because copying like a big code base
98:43 - like that isn't as simple
98:45 - as just like literally copying line for
98:47 - line because there are things which go
98:48 - wrong which takes it takes a level of
98:50 - understanding
98:51 - to actually go ahead and get that moving
98:54 - right like it takes level of
98:55 - understanding to get that working
98:56 - and get over that and uh frankie what's
98:58 - your what's your viewpoint on this in
99:00 - terms of um
99:01 - like sort of building projects for
99:02 - example like youtube tutorials
99:04 - and things like that definitely man i
99:06 - think that if you are building something
99:08 - that somebody's teaching you how to
99:09 - build
99:10 - obviously play a little with it you know
99:12 - have your twist to it so
99:14 - you know maybe maybe the interface is
99:16 - black
99:17 - play around with the colors change out
99:19 - the ui be like oh
99:20 - this looks a little bit more efficient
99:22 - i'm going to try this so now that you
99:23 - kind of have the building blocks of the
99:25 - whole project
99:26 - then you can just spice it up with your
99:27 - style you know and that's what's going
99:28 - to make you a great programmer at the
99:30 - end of the day
99:31 - you know playing with what you're given
99:33 - playing with the tools that you're given
99:34 - you know a lot of times you are working
99:36 - with a team so you're playing with
99:38 - other people's code this is a prime
99:40 - example of that now you have a project
99:41 - in your hands
99:42 - and then you can build it to however you
99:44 - want to see it you know
99:46 - and we right now you know have have
99:50 - offered a lot of great
99:51 - projects for you to build netflix you
99:53 - know covet tracker
99:55 - amazon all of these you can just change
99:57 - them up and put them on your portfolio
99:59 - make them even better
100:00 - share them with us you know share them
100:02 - with people help
100:03 - help people with that actual code you
100:05 - know now i do have another question here
100:07 - that i think it's kind of interesting
100:09 - just because
100:10 - this guy says he's been a node
100:13 - sorry a php developer for the last six
100:16 - years
100:17 - sunny what is your take on this node.js
100:19 - versus python versus php
100:22 - so this is a really cool question
100:23 - because i actually coded php for quite a
100:26 - while
100:26 - back in the day like many of you guys
100:28 - might not know that but yeah like i did
100:29 - php for a while
100:31 - um php did power the internet for a very
100:33 - long time facebook was built on php for
100:35 - for
100:36 - when when mark zuckerberg got it up and
100:37 - running um
100:39 - so my take on this guys is node.js came
100:42 - along and it wasn't
100:43 - super powerful when it first arrived but
100:45 - now it's it's it's it is insanely
100:47 - powerful like you can build entire back
100:49 - ends with node.js
100:50 - um python is something which is
100:52 - definitely a valuable skill guys it's
100:54 - really good for automation it's really
100:56 - good for
100:56 - building powerful powerful um sort of
100:59 - back ends and you can also go ahead and
101:00 - build like front ends
101:01 - with the sort of web development stack
101:03 - but i would recommend honestly
101:05 - at this point um i would recommend
101:08 - putting your time into javascript in my
101:10 - opinion
101:11 - reason being php is sort of getting sort
101:13 - of not i wouldn't say
101:14 - like deprecate but in the future years
101:16 - to come the market share
101:18 - like the number one most wanted library
101:20 - right now is react and that is
101:21 - javascript like it is such high demand
101:24 - and you'll see php on that list is
101:26 - definitely flying lower
101:27 - so my point is is that you want to
101:29 - invest your time in things which are
101:31 - future proofed
101:32 - where you're gonna have some reassurance
101:34 - that you know that the skills you're
101:35 - learning now
101:36 - are still gonna be sort of valuable in
101:37 - five ten years so my
101:39 - advice to that is node.js and then the
101:41 - runner-up being python yeah
101:43 - awesome yeah i myself learned some some
101:46 - php as well
101:47 - some people that say that it's super
101:48 - hard to learn it it's actually not that
101:50 - hard like
101:51 - and so i did that while learning a
101:53 - little bit of javascript
101:55 - to actually host servers and so
101:58 - you know i think it's a cool language
102:00 - yes it's getting a little bit outdated
102:01 - so
102:01 - do you know focus your time on something
102:03 - that's a little bit more relevant like
102:04 - javascript
102:05 - and that's going to be future-proof as
102:07 - sunny is saying i see a comment here by
102:09 - elijah fueller he says frankie could you
102:12 - promise us another video i mean my
102:14 - friend i really
102:15 - am enjoying this hopefully you know i
102:17 - can bring you guys a little bit more
102:18 - content
102:19 - thank you you know for for having me for
102:21 - sticking out this long and actually
102:23 - picking up a few
102:24 - things that me and sunny just discussed
102:26 - we're definitely going to have
102:28 - be bringing a lot of value to you guys
102:30 - in the future videos as well we're going
102:31 - to be live streaming this whole month
102:33 - and as of now we don't have any end date
102:35 - to this so it's just going to keep on
102:37 - coming
102:37 - yeah exactly we have a really good
102:40 - question i've seen a few people asking
102:41 - now react js or angular
102:44 - um really really nice guys um so
102:47 - react.js or angular
102:48 - my opinion react.js we teach it on the
102:51 - channel like that we have a bunch of uh
102:53 - sort of really valuable sort of
102:55 - resources that you guys can go ahead and
102:56 - check out right now for free
102:58 - um but my my take on this guys is
103:00 - because
103:01 - react is a library uh as compared to
103:04 - angular which is a framework now the
103:05 - difference with those two things
103:07 - is that it react is much more
103:09 - lightweight
103:10 - right it's much more lightweight which
103:11 - means the entry into it
103:13 - is going to be a lot easier when you're
103:14 - especially if you're a beginner or
103:16 - you're learning
103:17 - um and also guys huge companies are
103:20 - built with react like instagram
103:21 - tinder uber um you have like facebook
103:25 - facebook at the facebook react right i
103:27 - guess yeah tesla
103:28 - exactly you have all of these companies
103:30 - which are built with react whereas
103:32 - in angular it was something which which
103:34 - there was a
103:35 - there was a very high point where
103:37 - angular was in it was in high demand in
103:38 - use but now
103:39 - if you look at the sort of latest trends
103:42 - the trends flipped and reacted
103:43 - skyrocketing and angular and view are
103:45 - sort of starting to come down
103:47 - so like i would definitely recommend
103:49 - like we said before
103:50 - invest your time in something which is
103:52 - future proofed in this case
103:54 - react and i see assad oola says what
103:56 - about react native so that leads on to
103:58 - it
103:58 - if you learn react you're not only
104:00 - learning web development you're also
104:02 - learning
104:02 - ios and android development because if
104:05 - you know react
104:06 - you can code in react native put it that
104:08 - way like i i learned react and then i
104:10 - actually built a comp an app for a
104:12 - company in um
104:13 - in my first job and i didn't know react
104:14 - native i never could do it before
104:16 - um so yeah that would be my take on that
104:19 - one yeah
104:20 - man i think it's an interesting battle
104:21 - between react.js and angular i mean i
104:24 - feel like they're all symbiotic really
104:26 - it's depending on what you want to do
104:27 - it's interesting because react.js was
104:29 - made by facebook and angular is made by
104:31 - google
104:32 - so two of the biggest companies you know
104:35 - offered these
104:36 - languages or these frameworks for people
104:38 - to use just because they found
104:40 - more efficient ways to write their code
104:42 - and it's awesome man i know that react
104:44 - native is also a really good
104:46 - you know language to use as well if you
104:49 - do know react like sun is saying
104:50 - you can translate that to react native
104:52 - but react native in my opinion was
104:54 - really
104:55 - when hybrid programming hybrid you know
104:59 - mobile development started getting a lot
105:00 - of traction because
105:02 - other you know technologies like xamarin
105:04 - that were being used a lot of
105:06 - commercially
105:07 - actually didn't stick out that long so
105:09 - react native really gives the chance for
105:11 - hybrid mobile development to to come
105:13 - along and
105:14 - actually stay a little bit longer yeah
105:18 - really good point with xamarin by the
105:19 - way xamarin was really like
105:21 - it wasn't really pleasant to code in
105:22 - react it was much more of a better
105:24 - experience
105:25 - and it's quite powerful so definitely
105:27 - something to bear in mind guys like uh
105:29 - they learn over time right these things
105:31 - sort of they don't gain popularity for
105:32 - no reason
105:33 - they read that they are popular for a
105:35 - reason and uh it's definitely some it's
105:36 - a safe bet to go with react
105:38 - yeah cool there's a cool question here
105:40 - by monu such deva
105:42 - which says will dino js
105:45 - replace node.js what do you think about
105:48 - that i feel like we need to drop a video
105:50 - i feel like we need to drop a video
105:52 - around this because i see a lot of
105:53 - people asking yeah i'm curious as well
105:55 - so for those of you guys who don't know
105:56 - what dinojs is
105:58 - it's like so node.js is a runtime
106:01 - environment for javascript which is why
106:03 - you can run it on the the backend
106:05 - servers right so it's just an
106:06 - environment where you can run javascript
106:08 - now dino is essentially like a more
106:11 - modern it's newer it's more modern sort
106:13 - of runtime environment for javascript
106:15 - and the the difference here is that like
106:16 - one of the main differences
106:18 - is that out of the box it supports
106:20 - typescript so
106:21 - for those of you don't know what
106:22 - typescript is it's a sort of type
106:25 - definition um sort of uh
106:28 - they call it a superset it sits above
106:30 - javascript and allows you to say
106:32 - if a string is a string or if an integer
106:33 - is an integer as well as a bunch of
106:35 - other things
106:36 - i mean that allows your code to be more
106:37 - robust so will it take off i think so
106:41 - um but it's too early to tell um but in
106:43 - this like
106:44 - with all of this stuff guys it's like
106:45 - when react first view versus
106:47 - angular it's all going to take time and
106:49 - it's very opinionated
106:51 - is it worth learning i would say focus
106:52 - on node.js in my opinion
106:54 - yep awesome we got another comment here
106:58 - from shintan
106:59 - which says is flutter future proof
107:02 - i know flutter has been very popping
107:04 - very in inside of a lot of youtube
107:06 - videos a lot of youtube content i know
107:08 - cali halden
107:09 - made you know he made flutter one of the
107:12 - top
107:13 - five programming languages and flutter
107:15 - is developed by google what is your take
107:16 - on flutter sonny
107:19 - so flutter is actually something which
107:21 - i'm actually looking into learning right
107:23 - now
107:24 - um and kelly hayden's absolutely he's
107:26 - got some like banger videos right now
107:27 - with flutter
107:28 - um so i definitely go check him out if
107:29 - you're interested but um
107:31 - flyer is definitely it's got a lot of um
107:35 - it's got a lot of support right now um
107:37 - it has a lot of backing financially
107:39 - um i would i would say it's something
107:41 - which is a safe bet
107:43 - so we spoke about react native as being
107:45 - something which is quite like
107:46 - um quite good and it's going quite well
107:49 - but flutter
107:50 - right now is actually something which is
107:52 - very performant and it does really well
107:54 - in terms of like when you actually get
107:55 - up up up or up from running
107:57 - in in sort of flower but something to
107:59 - bear in mind guys
108:01 - you need to think about sort of your
108:02 - trade-offs here so flutter is also in a
108:04 - different language
108:05 - i think it's in dart flutter is um so
108:08 - when you want to sort of if you've only
108:10 - got a limited time
108:11 - learning something like javascript and
108:13 - also guys remember we just spoke about
108:15 - react versus angular the the sort of com
108:17 - what's similar between those two things
108:19 - they're both written in javascript
108:21 - right so javascript's a skill it's not
108:23 - only is going to allow you to learn like
108:24 - a bunch of
108:26 - valuable sort of things and you can do
108:27 - it on the front and back end but
108:29 - mobile development web development is a
108:32 - like in most popular library up and
108:33 - coming like
108:34 - i would stick with that as my sort of
108:37 - go-to
108:38 - in this sort of debate as opposed to
108:39 - just learning something which is kind of
108:41 - cool
108:41 - yeah that makes sense javascript is
108:43 - super versatile for whatever you want to
108:45 - do like you just
108:46 - mentioned you know front end back end
108:48 - anything related to the web it's insane
108:50 - now you know react native being able to
108:52 - even
108:53 - develop ios and even android apps you
108:56 - know hybrid
108:57 - mobile development that's insane so you
108:59 - know right now akshay does
109:01 - bring the question react versus flutter
109:03 - just because you know we like these
109:05 - these little verses type of questions
109:08 - i feel like they're kind of they give a
109:09 - huge insight to them what do you think
109:11 - about this
109:12 - exactly no no i definitely agree with
109:14 - that i definitely agree with that i
109:15 - think uh react versus flutter
109:17 - um react guys i'm gonna go with react
109:20 - because you can build websites you can
109:21 - build web uh
109:22 - web apps you can build ios native apps
109:25 - all from one code base which is amazing
109:27 - um leroy fernandez says a really nice
109:29 - coin he says
109:30 - sonny's amazing if only he could be a
109:32 - mentor to show the path engineering
109:33 - hardly teaches what actually matters
109:35 - guys so firstly thank you leroy we
109:37 - really appreciate uh
109:39 - like lovely comments like this and
109:40 - actually to answer your question

110:04 - your question yeah uh thank you
110:06 - and yeah i am a mentor
110:09 - awesome awesome yeah there's a lot of
110:11 - great mentors in profit with javascript
110:14 - not not only just a clever programmer
110:16 - team but we also have
110:17 - success coaches so success coaches are
110:19 - actually people from the community that
110:21 - are thriving in that community they
110:23 - actually have a great expertise in
110:25 - coding
110:25 - and we just bring them up in the
110:27 - community and make them leaders so
110:29 - they help other people in the community
110:31 - actually learn they do review their code
110:33 - they do teach them how to make their
110:35 - code more efficient how to implement
110:36 - things better all of these things are
110:38 - really part of profit with javascript
110:40 - like we were saying if you find this
110:41 - content valuable
110:42 - click the link in the description below
110:45 - and actually learn more about that
110:47 - specific you know product that we're
110:49 - offering to you guys just because
110:51 - like we said we've seen so many people
110:53 - change their lives by taking action
110:55 - and actually applying all of these
110:57 - principles being part of a community
110:59 - taking into account building a portfolio
111:02 - actually
111:02 - building projects that can be marketable
111:04 - and building all these skills all of
111:06 - those things are
111:07 - a sort of ecosystem that you surround
111:09 - yourself with so that you can thrive in
111:11 - a specific goal that you have that goal
111:13 - right now would be programming so that's
111:15 - completely awesome
111:16 - now we do have a question here by so
111:20 - and he asks which framework a beginner
111:24 - go through when it comes to python based
111:26 - like django or javascript based
111:28 - react js library so i think he's asking
111:31 - you know what what's a good framework
111:32 - for beginners
111:34 - when it comes to python maybe django or
111:36 - javascript
111:37 - you know using javascript maybe react.js
111:39 - library is a good thing to start as
111:41 - beginners what do you think about this
111:43 - sony
111:44 - yeah so i would say honestly i would
111:47 - definitely recommend
111:48 - react reason being is because like like
111:50 - i said guys compared to angular it's a
111:51 - library so it's actually like
111:53 - one they have a really really amazing
111:55 - tool called create react app which is
111:57 - pretty much
111:57 - one line of uh one line you run in the
111:59 - command line and it pretty much sets up
112:01 - your entire app gets the app running
112:03 - and that's it like you have a starter
112:05 - template up and running in like
112:06 - literally less than like three minutes
112:08 - which is insane and then all you need to
112:10 - do at that point is then just plug and
112:12 - play as you need things right
112:14 - you don't need to learn the entire way
112:16 - how react works or something like that
112:17 - as opposed to angular
112:18 - where you need to know everything before
112:20 - you can actually get something very
112:21 - small up and running so
112:23 - as a beginner i would definitely go for
112:25 - react.js yeah
112:26 - awesome looks like react.js is winning
112:28 - every battle just because
112:30 - of its versatility it's you know very
112:33 - easy way of
112:34 - being able to be digested and consumed
112:36 - and learn for beginners all these things
112:38 - now watch and learn only actually is
112:40 - asking
112:41 - how to understand that my vanilla
112:43 - vanilla js knowledge is enough for me to
112:45 - start learning react.js
112:48 - right really good question like we get
112:51 - it all the time in the coaching course
112:53 - um and i actually tell everyone like if
112:55 - you at this point can get a website up
112:58 - as in like when i literally a web page
113:00 - on the screen you can
113:02 - link your css to it you can link your
113:04 - javascript to it
113:06 - and you can pretty much write a function
113:07 - so when you click a button it launches
113:08 - your function or just says console.log
113:10 - something
113:11 - at that point guys what are you waiting
113:13 - for just go ahead and try to react like
113:14 - honestly just stop
113:15 - overthinking it it's not too complicated
113:17 - it's not too hard like
113:19 - just go ahead and get started so
113:20 - something i would recommend is like you
113:22 - literally go ahead and um
113:24 - is you just like if you're on the fence
113:26 - just give it a try just start use create
113:28 - react app it will make your life
113:30 - super simple especially when it comes to
113:32 - sort of getting involved in that
113:34 - and then starting off your journey but
113:35 - definitely um yeah something which you
113:37 - can get started with right now
113:38 - awesome guys i think we've hit a lot of
113:41 - questions now
113:42 - right now you know wrapping up
113:44 - everything these really were the five
113:46 - skills to learn if you want to become a
113:48 - self-taught
113:49 - developer in 2020 there is a lot of
113:52 - implications now you know it's
113:54 - a modern age all languages are getting
113:56 - modernized javascript is getting
113:57 - modernized with all of these new
113:59 - libraries
114:00 - these new frameworks this new way to
114:02 - applying to jobs right now it's an
114:03 - interesting time in the world you know
114:05 - you can get clients all over the world
114:07 - you can work with whatever company that
114:08 - you seem
114:10 - good fit with really and actually
114:12 - contribute to projects that are
114:15 - massive and even bigger than yourself so
114:17 - all these skills are super important
114:19 - you want to do a little a little summary
114:22 - of these skills saying
114:24 - yeah so like guys today we pretty much
114:26 - spoke about like the top
114:28 - five skills which uh you are gonna need
114:30 - to know as a self-taught developer
114:32 - to succeed um the first one was about
114:35 - all about communication
114:36 - how interpersonal skills and non-social
114:38 - are both huge
114:39 - and that includes soft skills like the
114:41 - ability to write emails blogs mediums
114:43 - basically communicate effectively not
114:45 - just in your technical skills
114:47 - but like in actually communicating with
114:49 - your team members how do you manage your
114:51 - time
114:51 - how do you handle sort of leadership
114:54 - roles and things like that right
114:55 - we spoke about that we also spoke about
114:57 - how to find yourself how to improve
114:59 - those odds
114:59 - by finding yourself mentor by doing
115:01 - things like reading medium articles etc
115:04 - then we spoke about number two which was
115:06 - learning how to learn
115:07 - right we spoke about time management
115:09 - productivity hacks how to handle
115:12 - the stress and anxiety of the sort of
115:15 - natural pitfalls of what seems to happen
115:17 - when you sort of start that development
115:18 - journey like when you get stuck on a
115:20 - problem
115:20 - and you can't figure it out we talked
115:22 - about how you can find your learning
115:24 - style
115:24 - how the ability to google is huge and
115:27 - how that's going to pretty much
115:28 - determine like your success as a
115:29 - developer because literally it's going
115:30 - to be something which is going to stick
115:32 - with you
115:32 - um throughout your your sort of coding
115:35 - journey
115:35 - um we gave you a bunch of tips and
115:37 - tricks on optimizing your workflow so
115:39 - you can have a bit of fun with that
115:40 - and also guys like creating an online
115:42 - presence and community and so forth
115:44 - number three we spoke about was
115:47 - debugging guys debugging is
115:49 - massively important it's something which
115:51 - you guys are all going to be stuck in
115:53 - for a very long time
115:54 - uh throughout your sort of journey and
115:56 - it's something which you want you want
115:57 - to become friends with debugging you
115:58 - want to become friends with that sort of
116:00 - pain
116:00 - and that sort of um and guys stop
116:03 - comparing to like the senior developers
116:05 - you will get there
116:06 - it just takes that sort of discipline
116:07 - and sort of building up uh sort of in
116:09 - your journey and then remember guys
116:11 - number four was developing a programmers
116:13 - mindset so develop that mindset
116:15 - we spoke about frankie dropped a bunch
116:17 - of value bombs about like
116:18 - how your attitude affects your behavior
116:20 - and that leads to sort of action results
116:22 - and then in turn
116:23 - you performing better in your role and
116:25 - how that's like a circular motion
116:27 - we spoke about those things and like
116:29 - getting involved in conferences
116:30 - you know like get a part of that build
116:32 - your portfolio do those things and then
116:34 - number five
116:35 - we spoke about get and why it's so
116:37 - massively important
116:39 - to land a job um because it's something
116:41 - which you're going to need in pretty
116:42 - much every workplace
116:45 - it's going to it's going to most
116:46 - companies use it like if they don't
116:48 - remember you don't really
116:49 - kind of want to be part compile
116:50 - companies like that um you and you need
116:52 - it to contribute to open source
116:54 - projects so guys massive massive
116:57 - amount of value and and knowledge that
116:59 - was dropped during this session if you
117:00 - guys found it useful
117:02 - smash the thumbs up and guys can we just
117:04 - drop like some
117:05 - fire right now in the comment section
117:07 - because like and this is all goes
117:09 - towards frankie because this session was
117:11 - super valuable
117:12 - and it's been frankie's first live and i
117:14 - think he's crushed it here guys and if
117:16 - you guys agree with that
117:17 - like drop him some comments and just
117:18 - like he has exactly rush
117:21 - this live stream like you guys have
117:22 - crushed this live stream this is like
117:24 - one of the best ones
117:26 - we have ever done on this channel thank
117:27 - you guys and like i can tell everybody's
117:29 - getting value
117:30 - you guys almost broke uh almost 10 000
117:34 - people have watched this so far which is
117:35 - insane and you guys have been sticking
117:38 - around the entire time like it has never
117:41 - dropped below certain and i'm even
117:42 - looking at chat it's going crazy
117:44 - the value bombs in this one were amazing
117:47 - guys
117:47 - should frankie come back on this
117:49 - platform to speak
117:51 - you let us know tell us in the comments
117:53 - below

117:56 - discuss a lot of things
117:57 - it's it's insane man a lot of factors a
117:59 - lot of skills
118:00 - it's cool because everything is just
118:02 - coming together now you know you guys
118:04 - are killers
118:05 - in programming you guys are killers and
118:06 - communication i mean honestly the whole
118:08 - team is and it's really a privilege to
118:10 - be able to share this knowledge with
118:12 - hundreds hundreds hundreds and even
118:14 - thousands of people man
118:15 - it really is a privilege it really does
118:17 - humble me thank you guys for being here
118:19 - you know all of these skills all of
118:20 - these factors we do teach them in profit
118:22 - with javascript
118:23 - which you know we really want to make
118:25 - the community massive we really want to
118:27 - bring
118:27 - value to the masses and actually make
118:30 - programming fun
118:31 - make programming something that can be
118:33 - attainable and actually
118:35 - be able to you know show this in a way
118:37 - that can be digested really simple

Cleaned transcript:

so pumped to have you guys here we've started this and today guys we have something very very special for you so today we're gonna be talking about actually uh the most important skills you need to actually become a selftaught developer and we're going to be actually going over the fact that these companies you guys do not require a degree to actually get a job how crazy is that sunny that's pretty interesting yeah dude like this is what we want everyone to know that these crazy big companies guys do not require a degree and i think that's going to blow a lot of people's minds and we're going to show you what skills you do need to be a part of these companies nowadays that's right so guys now one thing i want to do for you guys is we have a special guest coming in here today okay and this is actually going to be one of his first videos and he's nervous actually right now which is actually makes it even more uh so if you guys know and you've been here at clever programmer guys the last every single video like maybe the last hundred videos on clever programmer was made by this person okay uh he also helped this channel grow to 650 000 subscribers that we are today uh and when he actually joined clever programmer for literally a whole year he slept in his car so he could work and grow this company and help us crush it at a whole another level you guys i have the utmost respect for him everybody on the team thinks he's one of the best people that we've ever had the privilege to actually meet he's extremely knowledgeable he's extremely skilled at what he does and his humility is just amazing so guys what you're gonna be learning today all of this presentation is actually developed by him and he's gonna be just bringing you so much value and his understanding of how he sees the world is super powerful so please guys pay him the most you know like the biggest you know upstanding applause we're going to be bringing in frankie all our cone let's take it over whoa i'm so pumped let's go frankie yo what is up people how we doing man hey sonny how's it going so as kazi said today we're gonna touch on you know the companies the biggest companies that actually hire software developers without needing a college degree and so we're going to touch a few points a few of the skills that we think are the most important that you need to pick up you know to actually land a job or even get your career started with programming so let's get into it guys honestly this intro was even too much thank you guys so let's go dude we are pumped to have frankie on let's go thank you man thank you so yeah man tesla twitter whole foods now is is owned by amazon which is pretty much a tech company as well you know you can order your groceries online and everything google as you know facebook instagram costco all of these companies hire without needing a college degree let's go yeah and it's worth noticing that netflix is one of the highest paying companies when it comes to software development which is insane yeah how much was the pay you you actually told me a little bit ago 330k dude they pay their developers which is insane that is and they don't require a college degree that's almost half a million dollars and was it to be a frontend developer for netflix yep yep that's right that's insane some people think you cannot earn enough being a frontend developer some people think you earn even more being you know a full stack or a backend developer but it really does depend on what company you're working for so now with that in mind let's kind of go into this you know whole presentation i think a lot of value is going to be given so guys please pay respect to sunny and our presentation knowledge everything we're trying to share because it's really going to up all your skills so let's go into it yeah awesome step cool you want to kind of explain this sunny yeah so guys the first thing we want to talk about right is whenever we sort of jump around this sort of stuff have a why right and the way we're going to talk about how like finding your why today is know what your end goal is right so in this case on this channel we talk a lot about javascript as our main main programming language that we want to learn we're going to teach you guys and we also want to show you the possibilities when you are using javascript now here we have like three different options that javascript can bring you and what we want to focus on right now is understanding what you understanding the sort of possibilities that you can go into so one we have the ability to teach so you can see on the top right we have javascript and then we have the ability to teach with javascript and you can see that's going to be something where you can actually earn a bit of money very very quickly right so like very very quickly you can start earning an income with uh with the ability to teach the second thing we're going to talk about is the ability uh to jump in and handle freelance clients right so you can see this is something which is going to give you a bit more money and it's going to be a case of like you can handle if you can handle one client or 50 clients it's completely down to you right and then the final one is where everyone wants to get to and that's landing amazing jobs at google netflix uh instagram apple those kind of things and those companies pay big guys so just what we want you guys to sort of pay attention to is a while like before you actually jump into this video right now just have your end goal in mind right and he all of these things guys allow different possibilities the the final one landing a permanent job is going to give you stability freelancing means you can travel anywhere guys like you can literally work remotely you can do whatever you want to do and you can handle your clients as long as you have laptop and internet connection and the first one being the ability to teach is literally going to be something which you can start doing from day one so if you start uh coding a week you're now a week ahead of somebody who's never coded before so you can offer immediate value yeah that's even gonna go through today michael lecompte right he was here i think yesterday he was on a live and michael actually started getting a bunch of clients just teaching them how to code with i think it was c plus his one of his most strong languages and understandings of you can actually build a career out of teaching people and actually earn good income he was earning around 4 000 a month he's still getting clients to this day and scaling that business up while doing other things on the side amazing and guys we would honestly recommend that you always be teaching on the side so it doesn't matter if you are doing freelancing or landing a permanent position there's always going to be a room for a side income when it comes to teaching so amazing thing to know and bear in mind and the cool thing about teaching as well is the fact that you know you're earning money while learning even more so you're kind of engraving those those understandings really really well inside of your head inside of you know actually outside of you because you get reference experience of the people you know processing your information you have to refine your information once you're sharing it with others and that's going to make you even a better coder exactly we have loads of comments coming in guys how to my end angle is to become a freelance developer awesome ali malay nice my goal is to have boats you can have both if you do really well guys so like this is completely this is something you have control over nice i did want to touch on the fact that each specific journey that you take for example if you're teaching code or if you want to become a freelancer or if you want to get a high paying job at a tech company you know all of these skills all of these actual choices require different skills so for example if you're going to become a freelancer sometimes becoming a freelancer actually entails having a little bit more soft skills having a little bit more business skills you know sometimes people that look for top tech jobs might not have that that edge of business and that's why they might wanna build other things build bigger things and and you know that's kind of where their focus is at so i think personality is a big big big factor in distinguishing what journey to take what goal to have in mind huge massive massively yeah i mean like you get some developers out there who have all the technical skills but they can't really hold a conversation for longer than five minutes well they're very introverted and guys you do need a balance you do need a balance awesome yeah so we're going to touch on the number one big point and we feel like communication is key so suddenly you want to explain a little bit of the differences of styles of communication yeah so exactly guys communication is going to be one of the biggest things which is why we've actually put it as um the number one sort of one of the number uh the highest of skills that you need to know as a selftaught developer so interpersonal and nonsocial so we've broken them down into two different things right interpersonal when we say that we're talking about soft skills we're talking about like your time management your leadership your ability to work in a team all of those things are crucial to your success as a developer now you may not think about these things when you're developing you might just be thinking like about technical aspects and like um but do i just need to learn the language and that's going to be it but guys do not underestimate these abilities this is the difference between a developer is going to get paid like 30 000 a year to 100 000 a year literally a case of that like it's going to be huge right frankie definitely and obviously you know for you to be able to manage a team to work with a team to influence other people your communication skills have to be on point specifically if you want to become a good developer and you want to let your team know what exactly you're doing with the code you have to be able to you know present that in a fashion that people can digest so definitely interpersonal communications is one of the biggest aspects of coding that you can actually you know take into account that not a lot of people take into account now exactly i'm gonna touch a little bit into nonsocial communication so the nonsocial aspect of communication i think tech lead actually talked about it being antisocial communication just in general i did not like that name i was a little bit biased towards it but i feel like it's a very important point to touch just because you know it's one of the biggest things of nonsocial is talking through email making blog posts making actual things that are written crystallized because if you have a some sort of storage for that communication other people can actually access it and add to it and then learn from it and even you know make changes from it so that's exactly right and guys this is something which is huge when you have like let's say you you start a tech company right or you have you built a product and your product's amazing right like you need to be able to tell or like market your product and like why this is one thing i actually fell victim to i just i became so like entrapped with the the sort of mindset of coding that i literally forgot and i actually got really bad at the the sort of other skills like writing like and it sounds very silly but like coding is all about writing shorthand right it's all about writing short variables or like getting your code neat and concise and guys you need to remember like you need to keep hold of those other abilities in terms of like writing writing really sort of effective emails or effective blog posts or like even medium posts it's amazing not only to write like to read them i think it's really good practice to actually like incorporate reading them in a day to day but like also actually writing your own medium posts is really important um and i think it will actually benefit you a lot so let me ask you sony what got you out of that type of mind frame of you know having your head inside of the code too much and actually you know unraveling yourself to becoming a better communicator what was that so honestly but honestly failure failure was my number one sort of teacher through everything um i found like i just hit a wall right like i hit a wall so i remember i built a little product once and i was wondering that like nobody was buying it right like nobody was buying this thing that i built um and it just came down to a point of like i was sort of stuck in a place where where i didn't know the next step and i was like hang on i've done everything technically correct but like i feel like i've done everything so why is it not working and then it was only until i started surrounding myself with people like like carsi frankie aaron like all the guys and i realized marketing and that ability to speak to your customers and the ability to actually communicate with people um is huge right and not only that as a developer your ability to to actually have that side of the skill set as well is massive even with your communication to your employees or to your team members everything it really does make a difference so i think frank let's jump on to actual like what's the sort of soft skills and because a lot of people hear it being thrown around but we don't actually understand what that means so what are soft skills here we go so soft skills they're also known as people skills or interpersonal skills like we already talked about it and you know some of the examples that you can see here on screen would be you know leadership is a huge one teamwork is a huge one time management is really big too and obviously communication is all part of that the flexibility in your communication is also what's going to take you to you know do hard things like negotiation hard things like conflict resolution and things of the sort so all of these type of things are called soft skills and it is you know the skills relating to dealing with other type of people exactly and like this is usually like a good comparison here is comparing them to something like hard skills so remember earlier this whole talk is about pretty much why you don't need a degree and how you can succeed as a selftaught developer so in this case we tend to actually prioritize our hard skills so like how quick can we type um how good am i a programming language or do i have the degree or do i have a certificate which proves i'm good at this right but let's say you have everything on the left side right let's say you can speak like five languages you can code in like five four different other languages you have a degree you can type really fast but let's say you lacked all of the social skills let's say you couldn't even like hold a proper conversation or you can actually express your ability to code as a developer right that immediately cuts to your chances of landing the position or job or client jump like drastically you know because not only would work with you right at the end of the day yeah and exactly and you how can you build trust if you're not able to portray like what you're you're capable of what you can deliver all of that requires that communication flexibility leadership those things which are very much listed on the right and um something which was massively useful right so this was i think uh frankie have you read this book as well soft skills i've never actually i just heard amazing stories from it from kazi from you we actually met john sonmez as well so we even see it in his personality right that it's just something that's been integrated into him and also people from the company as well you and qazi yeah exactly and you know what that's a that's a really cool story that frankie touched on there so that's actually how like i watched a video back in the day where kazi released it about some books that you should read one of those books was soft skills and pretty much it opened my mindset as to like all of these the skills which you can pretty much see unlisted on the right and um that actually led to me eventually working with the clever programmer team guys so like don't ever take these as like skills that oh you know i can learn them later on or down the line these could potentially change your life like like these will affect your life as a developer massively and there are skills which take time to develop just like it does with coding and you should invest like that time and it's going to pay off like it will and this book guys it's called soft skills uh the software developer's life manual by john sonmez and i would 100 recommend that everyone goes ahead and grabs that book yeah and the thing is the biggest way that it's that soft skills are actually going to change your life is due to the fact that you're going to be able to communicate with people and people are everything man companies are made out of people you know software is built by people so when you do refine your communication skills then you'll build more relationships then you'll have more opportunities then you'll see what else to do so that's the way that it's that soft skills are going to change your life exactly exactly somebody said a book another book road map to freelance developer um oh no that's a video i don't know my bad it's a video uh okay awesome so you know touching on communication that really does lead me to like i said building relationships one of the most important relationships you can build is actually finding yourself a mentor so you spoke about you spoke about the importance for you right what was that you spoke about the importance of finding a mentor for yourself right can you tell me a little bit about your experience this was like game changer for me like honestly if i could if i could list like the things which made me a better developer from like one to ten this would be like number one because every time i was in a position or i was like even if i was freelancing i would reach out or i'd go to like these conferences and things like that and i would go ahead and actually try and find myself a mentor like whether that be a senior developer at the company whether that be like somebody who's just a little bit more experienced in like react or redux or something like that i would make it a mission to find somebody who actually was um like a level higher than me right and um that the reason why guys is because that is going to save you so many hours i cannot stress it like if you're all if you are new to development or like you're you're in that selftaught journey find somebody whether it be through facebook whether through the youtube comment section find somebody through stack overflow just find somebody who knows a little bit more than you and literally ask them just ask them because most people they just they they don't think you can ask when when in reality if somebody came up to you and approached you and said hey you're really good at something would you mind teaching me you need to think about it like chances are you probably would say yes so you probably would be like oh yeah i don't mean like this guy's gonna they're making you feel good and at that point you would want to learn and it's going to save you a lot of time and headache with debugging and a lot of other issues what's your thoughts on that frankie definitely man i think it is a shortcut to life to be completely honest with you just because of the fact that somebody else already put the time in to learn some skill so they have already invested a bunch of time and probably had so many failures in that specific subject that whenever they speak to you it's just going to be a huge shortcut for your experience as well it's you know it's learning through osmosis and one of the things that i want to add to that as you were saying it's it's really a reality that you can go up to people and tell them something like hey you know what you're really good at coding how about you teach me a little bit of your secrets of what you do of how you learned yourself i want to i want to kind of be in the level that you're at you can kind of approach things like this and i would add that you know offer something to them so maybe be like you know please teach me the way that you code and i'll teach you how i do wireframing because i'm a very visual person and i see that you're very analytical so always try to bring something to the table don't just ask for something always try to bring value so that you know it can be an equivalent exchange and that in terms is going to build a huge and a very good relationship with the person that is mentoring you dude that's that's actually genius what you touched on like the whole um thing about the ui like i actually sucked at ui right so i could do frontend development but i was trash at ui and eventually what i did is i reached out to some guy who was the company i was working for and i went ahead and said to him i was like dude like i can code and he wanted to learn how to code and i was like i can code but my ui is terrible like do you mind just giving me a crash course on you know you know user interfaces and things like that and um that's actually how like i managed to start building apps like the clones that we built and how they start looking the way they did because yeah like that's a really really good point that you made there like honestly guys offer some kind of value and literally it's pretty much a nobrainer at that point like they're going to enjoy like they're going to get something from it you're going to get something for it that's that's completely awesome and i love that you have experience with that and that it was actually something similar and if you guys are enjoying this content do like the video you know right now we got i don't remember his name he's from silicon valley but you know talking about the mentor talking about the mentor context so i think that helps you know if you guys find this this content valuable actually like the video it helps us a lot it really does mean the world to us because this allows us to share it with a bunch of people like you so exactly guys like smash the thumbs up and if you're finding value in this like it's going to help someone else find value from this so if you guys are enjoying it you know what to do nice cool another another great thing about being able to develop your communication skills is actually writing so one of the biggest right now platforms of writing in the on the internet is medium so medium is really cool just because of the fact that it's so easy going like you just look at articles and you can see how long they are in minutes that that to me adds like such a human experience to it and so it makes me actually want to read articles and there's articles of all types of things whether it be business programming anything in general we've seen qazi actually put up a lot of medium articles on very specific tasks about business and programming so you know even for him he actually uses it as a note taking app in a way so you know instead of storing it on your computer you're actually storing it on the internet so then you just google it you know whatever it is that you're trying to look for that you already made on the past then you have access to it exactly and guys think of it this way right like in the morning if you spend let's say 20 to 30 minutes just watching a tv show where you have breakfast right like for example look at the article on the right that's a three minute read a lot of medium articles are three to five minutes long like in terms of read you could fit about four or five different articles in while you had your breakfast now imagine you do that in a week and in a month and in a year like you're going to accelerate your development so far is going to be ridiculous if you as compared to somebody who didn't open up their phone and just check out a few articles and guys like this is going to teach you not only like what's new in the development world it's also going to tell you like the good practices the like the the sort of the sort of experiences other people had so that maybe maybe you can avoid those same problems that they've made it's also going to make you a lot more like lit like um better when it comes to your writing abilities because you're going to be involved in a lot more reading and i was actually somebody who was late to this scene um and it was only until like kazi really i sort of started seeing him like write blog posts and things like that like that i actually saw the value in that so this is something which if i was being a software developer now i would 100 be doing a lot more and think about it too you know if let's say you didn't go to college and you built your portfolio your portfolio is great imagine how good it looks to show that you've made so many articles on coding imagine the authority that it brings to you and imagine the impact that it brings to others not only to you but to others you know and so even that helps your career tons tons and helps distinguish distinguish you from the pack you know makes you very unique because you're providing value to the world in your own words literally exactly and that guys who are we kidding like a resume and a cv doesn't do it anymore you need more you need like a media models or a great way portfolios are a great way a great way like that's just going to help you stand out from the crowd definitely so now we're going to touch on our second point our second musthave skill to learn as a selftaught developer and that is yep learning how to learn guys like this is something like as soon as me and frankie both said it like we both were like yeah like this is something that has to be in here right like learning how to learn so frankie let's touch on the first point about uh finding your learning style what do what do you mean by that awesome so everybody really does have a different type of learning style and so i find myself to be a very audio person i like to hear things and i also like to see things so to me those are i think my strongest ones and right now we're gonna dive a little bit deeper into that some people are better you know learning with other people like through osmosis some people are better actually with tactile type of learning which is you know touching the actual thing some people are better just thinking about it logically you know so you do have to find the way that you learn yourself so that you can actually go go at this the long term because let's say you know it's taking you one week to learn something because you're trying to learn it by just listening to it instead of actually looking at it and by looking at it you'd probably you know learn in two to three days the difference the time difference is just massive so that is a huge huge deal what are you exactly and honestly guys like finding your style is going to mean all the difference between like spending an hour effectively versus like just sitting there just like bobbing your head and wondering why nothing's going in because like even reading books right i i always knew that yeah reading books is a good thing i just can't for some reason i can't concentrate that long on reading right so then i found audible and then literally when i would go for a walk i'd go for a jog or if i was doing like if i was at the gym like if i didn't want to listen to music i'll just stick on audible and i'll just listen to the book and i found that was really effective for me right and that actually was when i started to be like oh holy crap like i'm actually taking this stuff in and then i found i was also a visual sort of learner so like honestly finding your learning style is going to be a very very important step and it's the first step before you actually start even doing things that i would recommend that you guys go ahead and like try and try and identify what works for you and what has worked for in the past for you definitely definitely i think it's a huge thing you cannot ignore it so i think you know go go to it right away right away if you're learning something if you're trying to learn a huge skill like programming is that requires a lot of focus make sure you're learning the correct way for yourself now you want to touch on time management sony i think you're really really good at this so i think it would be perfect for you to tell us your experiences with it yeah so i remember when i was at university like somebody actually said to me um and this is like again like it's funny guys that we're actually doing a talk up today about why you don't need to be in the university and i can 100 vouch for that because i've been to university and i just it's not needed like it really isn't so save your money and and do this instead like um but like somebody at university anyway told me about a time management technique called pomodoro right now pomodoro is a small technique it's a very very simple thing that you can implement straight away and all it is is essentially you take take 20 minutes or 25 minute sessions right where you focus on nothing but the tasks that you're working on so let's say you are writing a medium article you're going to focus 100 of your attention towards that media market for 25 minutes then you have a quick fiveminute break and in that fiveminute break you do anything you want besides work whether i mean check your phone check your notifications go go to the toilet fill up your water wherever it is you do that in that five minutes right you do that four times and then you have a long break and you give yourself a bit like a half an hour hour um and guys it's so simple to implement and i promise you like once you just try it out like that you'll just see like oh my god i can get so much done in 25 minutes that before was taking me an hour to do and um frankie have you used pomodoro technique i use it a lot i actually use it for editing because sometimes i feel like when you try to push creativity like creative work it sometimes doesn't work that well a lot of times it does a lot of times it doesn't so what i have to do is kind of get into the flow of pushing myself to just say okay i'm gonna work for 25 minutes or 35 minutes and then give myself a 5 to 15 minute rest and when i do that and i do that multiple times let's say i do that for like two or three times that gets me in the flow of creativity and like it lets my ideas flow so i use it a lot for editing i use it a lot for when i'm doing very hard tasks because sometimes it's really hard just to sit down and focus like that and i wanted to ask you sonny because i know that you have your master's degree and did you ever use pomodoro because i know you know managing your time during you know academic things like this specifically something as hard as a masters degree in computer science you know you have to be very aware of how you spend your time and then your energy and your focus so can you tell us a little bit about that yeah so really good question so like two things here help me succeed with that so one was being understanding that i was actually a visual learner so i ended up actually literally i surrounded my entire room with like pieces of paper with like notes and different colors and stuff like that because that worked for me and like it would force me like as i walked into my room as i left my room to stare at that piece of information day in day out and what i would end up doing is that's the first point right that was the first point was understanding my learning style the second one was the pomodoro technique actually like a lot of us suffer from procrastination so i do big time frankie do you suffer from procrastination yo i'm the king of procrastination man it's insane like literally you open up netflix and before you know it you're like five episodes into game of thrones and like five hours of your life and you're never gonna get that back right so instead i literally when i found pomodoro i was like oh okay like 25 minutes no is it really long enough for me to get anything done and like before you know it i was like crushing it i was all of my work was getting done i had so much more free time and it blew my mind because like you can literally actually spend a lot more time doing the things you enjoy because you're actually focused when you're doing what you're doing and guys i forgot who said this but like when you're eating right you are eating so focus on eating enjoy the food like enjoy what you're doing when you're coding you're coding so like focus on that but don't worry about other things or don't have your mind elsewhere because like when you are literally like concentrating and focus 100 on a task you should just be thinking about that task like if you know that you need to go and get food later on that's a that's a that's a task for later on right give your 100 attention in that 25 minute session and then when you get that long break then you go and get your food that's exactly right that that's a very zenlike type of teaching very like buddhist like type of teaching and it really does remind me of our next point which is you know learn how to handle stress and anxiety and one of the big things that you can do is actually meditation so i know sunny you like to play a lot of meditation music while you're doing your coding and everything can you tell us a little bit more about that what type of practices you use yeah what helps you so i actually use this as well while i was studying a lot so i used an app called so i did try and do it off youtube and i really didn't find like a lot of success in it because i just didn't the truth is guys it is a skill to meditate like it is something which you need to practice and you need to build like an endurance for being able to like sit there and meditate and actually try and clear your head is quite hard um so i used an app called headspace and i'd really really recommend it uh you can get on the app store android and ios and basically it's an app and you pay a monthly subscription and all you basically do is just follow the steps in that headspace and before you know it i was doing from 10 minute sessions to 30 minute sessions and why this was so good guys is for one reason it just gave me clarity it gave me clarity on my life like it gave me a carry on what i wanted to focus on it gave me that clarity as to what i was sort of stressed out about or things like that and whenever i feel that life kind of goes a bit haywire and crazy i just kind of turned to meditation and it really kind of serves as like an anchor and pulls me back in and um when i joined the clever programming team i found it amazing because frankie is actually all about meditation right so like frankie like what's yours how was your journey and like how did you get into meditation what are the benefits that you found from it and why do you like teach other people how to meditate man meditation to me was just insane when i learned meditation it was uh it was a way for me to actually i made it very practical for myself and i feel like that's the reason why i went very deep into it so for example one of the ways that i used it in specifically in programming i used to actually program android apps and the way i was actually telling sunny this the way that i would think about ui designs you know it's a very big it's a very known thing to think about your ui design in the way and how many clicks it takes to get to a certain menu to take to a certain action and things like that so i would literally visualize in my head you know how many clicks would it take me to get to you know i was thinking of developing a meditation app actually a binaural beat app so an app that you can actually listen to different type of brain waves and you know these brain waves get you to different types of thinking or mind spaces or whatever and i feel like you know like you mentioned headspace is actually a very good app that you want to use if you want to start meditating right now headspace is actually a tech company it's actually a billion dollar company right now who would have thought that meditation is that oh yeah it's a billion so who would have thought you know meditation is that popular man and yeah like i was saying the way that i used meditation was to visualize you know my journey around my ui design so i could literally design in my head and then i could put it into code so for me it was it was a very practical way to use it as well as you know stress and anxiety which is a huge part of coding when you're debugging when you cannot think of the right function to call all of these things man people don't normally you take that into account the psychological factors of coding but it's such a huge thing and i would really recommend everybody to go into meditation and start that exactly and you know what like it's a really good point you touched on like when it comes to coding guys when especially when you're selftaught and you're in that early part of your journey right how many of you guys can relate to this and like throw in the comments let us know like i have always used to feel that sort of pressure of like am i clever enough to code or like am i really like am i doing enough like i'm am i like am i cut out for this and like the truth is that guys like i wish like i just knew the answer to that like earlier on and the truth is guys it's completely normal and i've spoken to the most senior developers like the most skilled developers and it's something which is a normal way to fill and every single coder feels it trust me and like this is why it's a really important point meditation is going to help you control that stress and anxiety which is why we felt it had a place in this list we have a comment by a7gr it says hey sunny sub dude just want to confirm today these guys are crazy like they are doing a live streaming here while other coaches with nas are in a live coaching call just enroll in pwj so it's crazy man right now there's there's another call with the pwj group and nas is leading it so i mean that's the way that we do here we try to provide a lot of value to you guys we really push ourselves to our limits and you know it helps us grow so much and at the same time bringing that much value to you guys so we're really blessed we're really grateful for being able to provide that for you guys please drop it in the comments below if you guys are liking it and if you do like the video because like i said it helps us a ton exactly and also that's ahmed from the course what's up dude nice awesome so one of the biggest things as well that we can do as a developer and one of the biggest skills in you know learning how to learn is your ability to google this is huge dude this is so big and it's off every for some reason it's off every single list right like there's a really funny meme on the next slide this let's go check that one out and like guys this is the most like relatable meme on the internet right like it doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience when you code or if you're fresh like uh and you're just beginning a development journey like you are going to have to master the skill of googling right to this day people think like you just memorize this stuff like honestly the truth is you get yeah there is pattern recognition you do so you do seem to like um remember things through repetition and sort of you know like repeating code but the truth is that i don't remember how to write certain kinds of functions i mean i always forget this stuff or is it better that or is it that you become better at googling you know exactly you know how much like imposter syndrome is a thing like it's actually a thing it's like we're not sure if we're actually good developers or are we getting good yeah we love this meme yeah so good and like truthfully like the ability to google is going to benefit you massively yeah drop in the comments below if you've ever watched futurama because that's where we got this meme so hey moving forward like i was saying the learning styles is a very important thing that you need to dive into because like i said different people learn different ways so some people you know learn the bodily and kinesthetic way which is being more aware of your body some people are very good you know building things with their hands building tools building desks all of these things some people are very smart being interpersonal like actually you know communicating with others conveying their ideas with others working with the team some people are good at just a verbal language and speaking trying to articulate what they're saying with words they're very good cause he's huge at that i feel logic he's very logic as well i feel like i'm not so strong in the logic sense i think i can be but i'm definitely more visual i'm definitely more audio and actually i say this spatial too visual and spatial what do you think you are sonny you know it's a good question i feel like i i'm very like i'm a very i'm very visual right like i feel like i'm quite a logic logical person i like to break problems down and sort of go from there i feel like i am quite interpersonal i like to be around people but very recently i noticed i'm quite kind of uh i don't know how you say can can mistake like i like to be active right if i if i'm not active literally to the point where sometimes i'll jump on a call and me and qazi would just go for a walk so he'll go for a walk in l.a i'll go for a walk in london and we'll just talk because like just being out and being able to walk around like and this and that like it it's just it somewhat connects your brain like a bit differently like and even like they're like going and training every day or something like that it allows me to sort of clear my mind get back on and kind of align and like it doesn't work for everyone but for me it's a big deal yeah definitely definitely you have to dial that in guys know what your learning style is dial that in and go all in so now we're going to touch on different ways that you can learn to code so one of the most important things that you can actually research for yourself is coding resources especially if you're being a selftaught developer this is going to be gold for you so can you tell us a little bit more about these examples honey yeah so guys like honestly if you're in the beginning of your journey these are going to be huge for you so honestly the first one which isn't even on this list is youtube so firstly well done if you're here because this is like a first step in like using a free coding resource like it's going to be something which like you will help you grow and it's going to help you sort of like better your skills as a developer um these ones as well so on this list we have code academy khan academy code avengers that's interesting treehouse is quite popular so these are all places guys where they offer a lot of free content they do have paid courses on there but if you're just getting started off you don't have to stress about like you know setting up your development environment they just kind of have everything laid out and i'd recommend that you do go and check them out and just go ahead and play with them get started as a developer and sort of get the basic fundamentals going with using these things because these are built and they've researched the best ways to get it as easy as possible for you to get started so these are going to be really really good resources to go ahead and get started with w3schools is another really good one it's not on this list as well but that's really good yeah definitely so that's why i say you have to dial in your actual style of learning because because each company does have a different style of teaching as well you know here in clever programmer we try to keep things very fun very engaged so if that's your style of learning you know do actually join one of the courses that we have here we even have free courses we have paid courses everything i'd say you know whether it's our company or any other company you know put a little bit of skin in the game and actually if you deeply want to learn this skill pay for it because once you pay for something it just makes it that much more serious you know if you're just getting free content your whole life it's going to be very hard for you to dive super deep into you know an eighthour tutorial 11hour tutorial 12hour tutorial that you have to follow just because you know but if you actually paid for it man you're gonna want to have that roi back so you know even that is leverage even even knowing that you learn with a little bit of pressure on your on your belly on your back you know makes you learn that much more it makes you understand that that can be your style of learning as well exactly and guys this is something which i would really like add on to what frankie said that like really really do like focus on like investing in yourself like if i asked you today like would you pay like 500 to go on holiday like most people would say hell yeah like where we going to fly to you right but if i said to you would you pay 500 in yourself to literally change your life so that you can make more money and go on as many holidays as you want then it becomes a completely different question right and most people will be like oh i don't really know but then they want the end result right so remember what we said in the beginning focus on your end goal first and then figure out how to get there right so in this case investing in yourself is going to be one of the most crucial things that you can do and like guys we do offer a course called profit with javascript which fits in here perfectly um and it does teach you a lot of things so i would recommend you use the code the free resources out there on the channel we have a bunch of free stuff on um which will literally help you get started and and get going and then if you do feel like you want to take it to the next level be sure to check out profit with javascript there is a link in the description if you guys want to go check it out um and pretty much yeah you can pretty much go from beginner all the way to your end end goal like we spoke about in the beginning definitely man even adding to what you said about investing in yourself i feel like that actually is a habit and once you start doing that more and more and more it's like you're actually betting on yourself you're actually believing in yourself so you start kind of framing your mind in a certain sense that now you believe that you will take action on the things that you do that now you're actually gonna bet on yourself because you do see yourself following through all the way and i feel like that's that's a huge an important point to touch if you're gonna be a selftaught programmer another big point that i do want to touch on is actually optimizing your workflow because you know if you don't want to be the most productive that you can be with the time that you have you know everybody has 24 hours in a day the only difference is everybody manages their time different and so if you're able to actually you know work with the specific tools that can help you either you know make your workflow faster either share what you're doing with your team or you know just moving files around these are some of the tools that we ourselves in clever programmer as a team internally use can you explain some of these sonny yeah so it's an interesting story so frankie and the guys got me started with a bunch of these tools so i wasn't actually using alfred before i was using spotlight just the builtin apple thing um and like alfred is the middle guy with the hat so it's actually uh i only found out today the reason why it's called alfred is why frankie it's funny it's funny i told yeah i told him today um and i actually saw the name and i'm like wow isn't that batman's butler and yeah that's everything that's right what it is yeah man and i was like so cool because like go ahead yeah i was just gonna say because literally because alfred guys it's like it's so powerful like literally to the point where there's a really handy feature on alfred where i've got it hooked up to command spacebar so it literally pops up on the screen but i if you like on alfred if you pay for the sort of booster pack which is only i think it's like 10 or something but like once you have that literally every time you copy like a piece of text right it will literally keep track of like the last three months worth of your copied contents which is huge i can literally never have to like remember things anymore it's insane yeah man i love that like even if you're you know you have a snippet of code that you need to paste for another project even if you know you're trying to get a specific line of code or even a comment or even you know anything a password or really you know a url link something like that utm parameters like we use a lot in our team you know all of these things are stored there for even three months or even i think even more man but to me that's one of the most handiest tools for sure alfred yeah definitely the next one is so the one on the right is really good it's something called yoink uh so it's yoink and the reason why this one's really cool guys it's literally like it should be built into mac like because it is all like even windows because it's so handy it's like a little thing that pops up on the side and you can just hold some files in there and then you can pull them out as you need them so definitely if you're interested check that out because the whole team uses your ink loom is a cool one for making really interactive videos very fast so there's no editing you just hit the record button and then you have a little popup with your face in there from the webcam and then you can just sort of talk through your code that's really good guys even for applying to job interviews because what's really cool like is you could send a resume to a company right but if you send a personalized loom video going through their website saying hey i checked out your website and it's really cool really amazing like i love all this stuff this is what i can do hey why don't you check out some work go through your work on a loom video like that immediately sets you up from the crowd like it immediately just makes you different it makes you sort of somebody who they're gonna actually pay a little bit more attention to because they've gone out of your way to do that the final one which isn't on here guys is actually um setting up your coding environment so a lot of people use something called visual studio we use visual studio code to actually get coding and get up and running guys personalize it optimize it to be like your playground because that's where you're going to spend all your time learning right so prettier is a really good extension i'd recommend vs live share so you compare program with people is amazing me and qazi me and uh and aaron and kazzy like literally everyone on the on the team has used vs code liveshare to pair program like in a google doc right um there's so many handy plugins and stuff like that because optimize it so that you have fun while you do it and i can see a lot of questions about like how can i stay motivated how can i like keep like how can i keep my motivation levels higher like mohammed dawud hamid asked how do i stay motivated to code and guys truthfully motivation and this is something which i think frankie would agree on like motivation will always come down right like there's going to be like when you start your journey motivation is going to be skyrocketed it's going to be so high but like your discipline is what you have to focus on and build right and like building that is going to be your crucial thing as to succeeding as a selftaught developer but your motivation like what sort of a little hack i use to keep my motivation high is just make my whole workflow fun like if your workflow is fun you enjoy what you do and if you enjoy what you do it's easy to do man if you're playing the long term game you definitely have to make it a little bit pleasant for you because if you're feeling discomfort all the time it's gonna be it's gonna obstruct you from actually you know getting the things done like you want them to so you know actually making your workspace flow a little bit better it's gonna save years not even just that just your emotion your energy is gonna go through the roof so that's a huge point that we like to touch here and one of the last tools that we forgot to touch on is actually rocket and this is rocket this is for mac there's obviously equivalents for windows as well rocket is cool because i feel like it gives a very human touch to text you know we're talking in computers a lot so if you're able to put emojis here and there it actually conveys a lot of you know data just visually in text so that's an addition to it definitely yeah rocky guys just to be clear is a way of just adding emojis into your text in a really like easy way so you just do colon and then you get like you type in what you want and it'll pop an emoji on the screen so really really human sort of thing which actually makes a big difference when you're you're doing a lot of sort of people to people conversations yeah we use it with our ads we use it when we're taking notes that we share internally on the team all of this this takes me to actually another big part of learning to learn is gonna be a huge huge huge thing for programming in general for programming interviews for literally the academic side of programming and that is going to be data structures and algorithms guys so data structures in my opinion are the ones that you should focus a lot of your time around because it's practically what is going to be important for most scenarios but if you do want to kind of go the route of sort of going for like fine companies like google netflix amazon they are going to test you on algorithms because it's all about optimization and efficient efficiency so like that's like binary search three algorithms that sort of stuff now me personally i actually don't dive too far into algorithms i kind of just focus on mastering data structures and what i need in what situations frankie what's your thoughts on this like data structures versus algorithms yeah man data structures really do dictate the way that you're gonna code so for example if you're thinking about maybe you know searching through a list that you don't want any repetitions you might use a hash map if you're using java or you know if you're trying to traverse through a linked list and you know you're going to through a list then you might want to use a certain type of algorithm that i don't know it can be like a dividing conquer algorithm or something related to that but really you know the data structure that you use is going to dictate the code that you're going to use it's it gives that's why it's called data structure because it is the structure of data you know at the end of the i day never dove too too deep into this to these two categories the farthest that i learned is really traversing through linked lists and actually you know binary trees and seeing how algorithms work they're actually not as hard as people make him out to be and they're actually very very visual and it's what a lot of people don't sometimes pick up yeah and just to sort of pop a bubble here like guys it's like a big elephant in the room whenever we mention the word algorithms because whenever i used to algorithms i was like oh algorithm sounds cool it's like i want to learn how to use like make algorithms or write algorithms all algorithms are are a sequence of steps literally if it's like if you need to go to the shop it's like like open the front door walk out go to go inside the car put the keys inside the car it's literally steps that you're going to follow right same for the computer like i said it's a series of steps that you're telling the computer and then that's how you you're going to get it moving and then obviously you're getting different levels of complexity there but don't over complicate and honestly like don't freak out like we said focus on the data structure stuff until you really need the algorithm section stuff like because honestly even in my experience i haven't actually found too much of a need for it yeah so i would if if you want to sort of know from experience i would say focus more on the data structures um and that brings us on to the next point which is huge and i think it's one of the biggest talking points and that is what frankie it is debugging debugging actually debugging is might be one of the biggest biggest things in programming and it actually we were talking about this sunny and it's in my opinion one of the ways that you learn the best because you're actually troubleshooting your code you know you're realizing the you're back you're backtracking the steps that you did you're like okay this is connected to this if i delete this then this is going to happen and then you know it kind of gives you a whole symbiotic process of your code you know what is your take on exactly i couldn't agree more like guys like this is where like it's one of those things that you kind of have to like have conversations with developers and sort of understand that like it's a normal thing right it's one it's a normal thing and two it's literally the place where i probably learn the most when i'm debugging when things break is when i learn the most and like one thing i will really just need to address straight off the bat is i get a lot of like messages from like students and people who are who are sort of following our live streams which is basically about they're getting stuck and then they they spend like an hour or two debugging right guys be prepared when it comes to this and you just have to like be prepared for this like be prepared to spend hours and hours debugging or like even if it takes it like days i've spent a week fixing a problem before but i'll tell you one thing like when you you like when you solve that problem i can promise you that same issue will not bother you again in the future like because you would have spent hours and hours and days and days and that's literally where it really ingrains into your head as to what what was it that how did you fix it how did you identify the problem how did you sort of do it and these are things which then they can't always be taught you kind of have to go through that element of sort of like sitting there and banging your head against the keyboard but it's a normal process guys so like uh frankie what would you say is to like to answer those people who are like i can't code for like eight hours or like you know like you hear about these developers like even when we do live streams we're coding for five to six like five six hours at a time like a lot of people sort of they saw want to do that off the bat is that realistic not at all man it is like everything else in life any skill that you do want to learn you have to build that stamina and that endurance it's like running i love running myself i'm a huge fan of running just because of the psychological benefits that i see of it and really you know it's crazy man because stamina is so related to the consistency of the the consistency that you have that because at the end of the day for example if i stop running for three days just three days man it's gonna be very hard for me to run three miles but if i'm running every day like let's say today i ran three miles next day i can run five miles next day i can run eight miles but if i stop running even two days if i run five miles then the next day the three miles are gonna feel even more than the five miles so it's the same way with coding man it's you know if you are not used to coding for long hours and you wanna code for four hours straight your brain is gonna be a little bit fried so you're gonna have to take breaks in between and you're gonna have to build up to that exactly and it's all about the consistency at that point like focus on consistency as opposed to like spending hours and hours and hours at a time like the hours will come guys like having all night coding sessions that stuff naturally like sort of starts to happen when you sort of just like like frankie said like stick it consistently and day by day you'll notice that growth and you'll notice that you can spend longer debugging but it is one of those things which like naturally in the beginning it's one of those more painful processes but it's the most valuable thing because you will never stop debugging and that's the truth you will never stop debugging so you might as well get really good at it and that's going to really help your journey as especially as a selftaught developer um and and how you learn and uh this is this leads us on to the next point guys like debugging is one of those scary like processes right it's a scary process because sometimes you can feel like you're just hitting a wall and you can't overcome it so the one thing we would recommend is actually get inside of some kind of community right whether that would be stack overflow whether that be youtube or something but like get inside the community and this is where like we have an amazing like i just feel like there's like i just i'm yet to see a community which touches like profit with javascript because like we have 1 300 plus people and it's growing every day and like guys like if you get stuck in profit javascript like i i literally i can't even respond as quickly as some of the people jump in and help out a student or like it's amazing and like frankie you've seen this firsthand as well right like what's your thoughts on that man it's incredible to begin with 1 300 people in a slack community that are super duper active like wow it's like having a village having a whole village of developers inside of one specific platform the thing is the most interesting part about it is that everybody has a similar goal everybody has a similar path and so once you're around people that actually you know are looking to go the same way it just it has this magnetizing feeling to towards you know moving to your goal it you see other people getting you know getting a job getting actual results and you're like that person could do it i can do it too i mean i talk to him a lot i actually know how he works i mean i think i can be in that skill level too as well so it's actually very motivational to be in a community like this it's huge man if you do want to stay and be a selftaught developer on the long term play the long term game you have to have to have to look for a community that works for you yeah and truth be told like i'm yet to find something like that like which is why prophet javascript jumped out to me because i was one of those people who guys like we've all been there we're scared to kind of write into that stack overflow that i'm stuck on something because stack overflow makes you feel so dumb sometimes especially when you're learning in your journey like it's one of those places where somebody will come out like you you'll write a comment saying i'm stuck on this and you literally have five developers tell you like you're a piece of like yeah man like literally yeah they're like shoot you down exactly like they'll just let you like go at you like so like we do recommend like if you guys are interested it's the first link in the description go and check it out because like if you if you have run into any of those problems that we sort of mentioned like we can promise you like we fixed that in profit with javascript like we we this is like the reason why most of like literally every single one of our students say it's worth a 10k coding bootcamp like exactly because they just see so much value in that sort of community itself let alone the coaching calls and everything else so many different really really big in different types of levels that are together in one place are actually just going to boost up your performance your ability and really your whole motivation to code and you know exactly this takes me to my next point and this is a huge huge point if you want to do become a selftaught developer in 2020 now that everything is getting modernized everybody's going into the internet you know something huge is actually creating online presence can you talk a little bit about that sonny because i know that you yeah you're so consistent on instagram and you know even on youtube man yeah like is in this is something which like i wish i did earlier guys like i really wish i did like and qazi is the ultimate example of this guys like like build like a following right like and literally it's not it's if you the way to think of it is like most people that i see who are starting off who don't do this like the difference between those guys and the guys i see posting like daily and frequently about like this is javascript it's not because the difference is like it's a way of keeping yourself accountable it's a way of constantly ensuring that you're moving forward so like by posting new content every day you need to be creative you need to think about like hang on what can i post today and like it's going to force you to learn about what's new in javascript what's new in web development what's new what can i learn today which is going to be cool for everyone else to see and like this goes on to the next slide which is basically a case of like guys record your journey but like on literally say you got instagram you got linkedin you got twitter you got facebook you got youtube like and don't be afraid like there's a really like good video by garyvee and it's like just stop giving a about like what everyone thinks like just go ahead and record it and as a developer guys like i can't stress enough like record everything including your failures and yes like when i say that like include your failures as well guys like because it's literally going to be a case of like that's a moment where like this is where like we sort of remove the stack over for overflow problem because when you literally are able to go ahead and say like yeah i'm failing on this today like you'll be surprised about how many other people are failing and i was sort of stuck on the same issue and then you start a community yourself like you start talking you meet people who are likeminded and doing the same thing as you um well what do you what do you think about that frankie especially with the failures part because a lot of people sort of like a bit like whoa what do you mean like record your failures yeah man i think that definitely it's super important to document your journey like garyvee says some people it's very hard for them to start you know recording their journey just because of the fact that they want to create something they want to create a scenario where it might look good on camera but the truth is that the most the best thing that you can actually see on camera is authenticity is genuine action is is really what's going on in your life and the way to do that is actually just documenting your journey man i know for a fact right now chris sean is one of the one of the youtube channels that i like he's a smaller youtube channel and this guy really does literally document his journey if he's getting fired off you know from his work if he's actually getting another job he's being super transparent with this we we might have him on the channel soon enough uh shout out to chris shawn yeah but man the failures are super important of a super important part of your journey it actually gives a little bit of flavor to your journey if you don't have any failures man it's like you can't you can't really boast about anything you can't really you know say that you struggled because everything seems like a like a landslide from there so you know that really does take us to our next point which is develop a programmer's mindset so can you speak a little bit about this sonny yeah so guys this is a big point because it's literally like when we kind of go into coding right we go in very like with a naked mindset of like we just don't know what to expect right like and we just kind of assume like it's this straight path like it's a straight path and like you have a beginner in the beginning and at the end of that road you have like some developer position or a job or something like that and even at the end of it like when we starting off i didn't know about teaching i didn't know about freelancing i didn't know about any i just knew that maybe i'll get a job at the end of this but the reality is it's not a linear sort of it's not like a line right it's a circular sort of mindset that you kind of need to adjust to and this goes into like getting your attitude right like how do you stay positive and how do you stay motivated and like i said motivation is something which you're going to start off with super high you're like wow there's so much money there's so much just now i want to do this forever blah blah blah but then you need to be able to be able to build that discipline right this goes on to like your behavior like what is what are you going to change with your behavior like are you going to start like and like incorporating like a pomodoro technique to make sure that you keep yourself accountable and you make sure that you're like sort of doing you're doing your work when you need to do it and that leads to like actions right actions like when you have a problem are you going to sit there and actually act on it or you're going to just sit there and stare at the thing and sort of make up excuses and things like that right when you do that enough times it's going to lead to actually leading to some kind of result right that result could be literally you getting paid by a client that result could literally be um you landing a job right and then what happens is that when you do those things it builds your confidence right it builds your confidence your performance overall as a thing goes up and then again that goes into your attitude it makes you feel good so you see like it's this circular movement right and frankie i feel like you have some really good insight here especially when it comes to like the sort of the attitude and the behavioral side of things like what what's your take on that like what do you feel about this sort of developer mindset man attitude is everything man every attitude is i cannot stress that enough just because when i've seen things go grey in my life whether code is not working whether my job is not working whether my living situation is not working as cause he said i was living in my car for two months actually that was pretty insane attitude is what actually you know dove me to take massive action to change my behavior and you know what attitude really is it it's what's that word that i'm looking for it's contagious you know you contage you you actually it transfers to other people the way that you feel about yourself the way that you feel about life and man this is massively important in a team you don't want to be an energy draft for your whole team especially if you're doing a project that is that's as hard as being a developer you know let's say you're building a rocket ship just like daniel is let's say you're working in tesla creating selfdriving cars you don't want to have somebody that's going to be a sinkhole of energy and your team attitude is one of the most important things because as sonny was saying attitude does affect your behavior and then action is really the byproduct of behavior and then your action really brings results so then the results dictate your performance you know so you know seeing that you're getting good results it's gonna affect your performance it's gonna give you positive feedback or negative feedback and you have to reiterate from that and i feel like being very honest with the feedback that you get being able to be part of a community or a team of people that tell you hey man you actually you're you're you're doing bad right here like you have to change this you have to reassess this because you're actually affecting other people you have to be very honest about you know what is in front of you and actually being able to take action on that that in itself is a huge skill that'll take you to become one of the best people you know in your community you're gonna be super influential exactly and two things that frankie mentioned there which were gold right one is like it's like it's it's kind of like contagious right that attitude and that mindset is going to be massively contagious so imagine like you have a bowl of fruit right what happens if you have one bad fruit and then it's like a rotten fruit it spreads right it spreads and the whole bowl gets infected and all the whole thing is no longer edible right so like that's an easy way to think of it right so what we're trying to move to is like you need to surround yourself with like positively like charged minded and likeminded people and this leads on really nicely and the one place that you can go ahead and find people like that is like developer conferences right so developer conferences are going to be amazing places where you can go and find people that are like not only that they're going to be developers there there's many people that aren't developers that are like business people so you might get exposed to different areas uh uh and different sort of things which you wouldn't have otherwise sort of exposed yourself to but like guys this is really gonna sort of help you um take your sort of skill set like for example if you're lacking in soft skills i noticed when i started going to conferences i massively opened up and i became a lot more extroverted as opposed to sort of being that introverted developer what's your take on conferences um frankie man i love conferences of all sorts that's how frankie and i met yeah exactly that's oh no that's cozy man yeah this is literally how him and i met and that's how aaron and i met yeah conferences were kings one of the things that i didn't want to touch on is the fact that we said we mentioned you know have an online presence do record your journey one of the big things we do in the team you know every time that we go to conferences we actually interview tons of people because there's no other scenario where so many likeminded individuals come into a place and not only that they're likeminded but the levels of you know their performance is huge so all types of people of each level are in conferences and so one of the things that we did last conference we were at funnel hacking live in nashville tennessee and we ended up having about three different interviews with people that we admire and that's insane and we would never be able to have those type of interviews in any other part of the world really so you know you do want to record your journey go to conferences meet these people and it's such a good way to start a relationship if you interview somebody you have just that much more connection because you guys have produced you know content together you guys have actually you know shared a bunch of experiences in front of a camera which is a very intimate type of thing you know even that helps you build a relationship with that exactly and we had a lot of questions earlier as to like how can i find a mentor or how can i find people like when i'm starting out as a beginner guys this is like the place to go to like honestly a lot of conferences are free like i went to a facebook one recently in london and that one was completely free and i met a bunch of cool people there and actually made a friend there who ended up helping me solve a problem i was having at work like so like the the sort of networking and the power that you're going to get from that is is really unbeatable and like and that was completely free so like if it's a sort of concern as to money like guys a lot of this is free and also if you're in different parts of the world you can actually join conferences like digitally and you can actually sit inside of like calls and this and that um and then like you you'll meet people in the comments section like it's really definitely something i would recommend that everyone is for developers especially right now with the whole covet thing going on you know right now maybe there's not a lot of conferences going on but like you mentioned digital conferences are a huge thing and actually i know for a fact nas is one of the people that would get a lot of roi in conferences he started working with us about in november of 2019 and he was telling us that a lot of his clients freelancing clients came from actually being in conferences so you know sparking out conversations with other software engineers or business owners you can offer your service to them try to solve their problems and really all of those things are going to help you massively and that really just takes me to my next point our next point which is yeah so guys like pretty much it revolves around the developing programs mindset so we have we've made like a few different points which are going to help you start and get and get on that sort of um path to doing that so one of them is we mentioned is finishing your projects now what we mean here guys is literally it's can this goes hand in hand with number two so mastering one language so firstly i think it'll be a good thing to actually explain that one so guys when you're starting off your journey right there's a lot of people that are here like should i learn this or this should i learn java or python should in javascript or or like c plus plus now guys whatever you learn like all i will say is that like uh we we've all sort of everyone on the teams coded for a very long time and honest like joint advice is literally a case of like once you know one language it's very transferable right but the thing is you need to stick to the language that you're sort of learning especially if you're in a beginner level stick to language you're learning and actually build your skill set up to a point where it's a sellable skill right build your your skills up to its first points it's actually celebrated it's actually useful if you keep jumping language and like you're doing java one second python one second and then you keep jumping around you're never going to reach a point where you can actually sell your skill right and this leads on to the first point of like finishing your projects so um frankly what do we mean here when we say finish your projects so a lot of people do have the habit of starting a project and just finishing about 80 of it i myself have seen myself in that situation a lot of times whether i'm like building an app or anything related to that i would see that i would have the ui design i would do the front end and i wouldn't finish the back end and i was like oh man it looks pretty but it didn't have any functionality to it other than just linking me to another page you know and the thing is that if you do develop that habit it's really hard for you to get out of it and the thing also is that you know you're creating a project you cannot even put it on your portfolio because it's not an it's not a complete project it's not it's not something that can be sellable like sunny was saying and you actually mentioned something really funny sunny um right now that we were talking about specifically mastering one specific language you know some people do dive into a bunch of different languages and they're like oh yeah i know python i know javascript i know java and i know all of this and then somebody in the interview is like okay book can you build something in one specific language and then they're like no but i know all of these languages it's like what is the point of that you know you cannot build anything so you're just kind of knowing knowledge to know it you know yeah that's that's right exactly like yeah literally guys and the one thing i'll answer here is that like if you are in doubt as to what language to sort of start or like what language do you sort of pick first what i will say is like a lot of people kind of go towards i don't know why this happens but like they go towards like the languages like java c plus plus like the sort of like oh because they're the more tougher or clever languages that people say right yeah now what i would say is throw that mindset out the window and focus on value driven growth and what i mean by that is what is going to be the language is going to give you the sort of most value and think of it in a sellable way right like if you have a client who comes up to you and says i want a website built it needs a front end on the back end literally javascript is going is an amazing language for you because why it's it's going to be very easy to like get things up and running as a front end you can also use javascript as a back end with node.js focus on that if you if you went ahead and started learning c plus plus cool you could probably build like an embedded little uh circuit board right now how's that going to help you build like a website right like you see what i mean like think about it in that sense and suddenly the questions start making sense yeah man a lot of people think that you do have to end up you know learning a super complicated language or complex language like c plus plus or maybe even assembly so that you can know how you know data is being stored or how how to actually do a bunch of complex things that how a computer thinks how you know circuit boards work things related to that and that somehow is going to help you know programming so deeply that you're going to understand other languages well enough well the thing is that it really is what are you looking to do you know if you're trying to build a web page if you're trying to go into maybe ai maybe something related to python i don't know you know it does require different types of skill set sometimes it doesn't require you to dive that deep as to learning all the nittygritty like sunny says very british logan mentioned a really good question here guys it says understanding that i challenge you on at least from a job searching standpoint a lot of job descriptions are listing off for three to four languages for entry level positions how do i find a medium that's actually a really really good question um it's a really really good question and it's true like a lot of job listings ask for like a bunch of different languages so how do you find the middle ground and what my answer is to that is like think about it from this perspective right like if you have a web development job and let's say the job is a react frontend developer or something like that in that job i do agree with you it's going to say like javascript is going to say maybe java for a backend role or something like that or node.js or something like that like but then what what tends to happen actually in those job listings if you look at it deeper they're actually usually broken down into skills which have revolved around javascript so like um ability to use rest apis ability to use redux ability to use things like that and the ones that do list every language under the sun i can tell you now like if you actually go for the interview and like sort of speak to them it's sometimes it's literally because they've literally copied and pasted sort of another job listing and they've just modified it and sort of made it sound like it's a very sort of common thing as to like even when react first came out there was job listings saying five years experience in react which is something so funny because like react hasn't hadn't even been out for like a year at the time but like people wanted like like five years so like the point is is that like to get a middle ground there guys focus on one language and naturally you'll start to sort of build the stack or sort of your knowledge around the stack that the job positions are going to be asking for and then once you get a conversation going it kind of moves to a point as just show them that you're eager to learn and then the rest becomes like quite a sort of simple conversation to have yeah definitely and another great way to actually bring down that knowledge to something practical is building projects yeah exactly so yeah so yeah building projects there's an example of the netflix project that qazi and sunny built a few days ago this this actual video is going viral it's insane we were surprised man i didn't know so many people wanted to build netflix so can you tell us a little bit more about this project yeah yeah exactly and guys if you enjoyed like if you were actually here and built this project let us know right now and like literally a case of we just went ahead and like what i will say is that like if you're if you're in your early journey right and you're sort of beginning a beginner uh what i would definitely recommend is go ahead and check out the live sessions that we did because it really really was like there's so many like value bombs in those videos where we just go ahead and build projects and what we sort of taking away and leading here up to is basically like guys when you're new build projects and like we said before make sure you finish them right make sure you finish them so build the projects finish them and then guys what this is going to show is you do not want to be that developer who goes to a job prints out a nice a4 piece of paper with a list of skills on it and says this is what i can do because i'm telling you now like they're going to look at you and be like um okay but like where's the proof like can you actually are they going to ask you a bunch of questions and they will catch you out if you're if you're lying to them so instead if you have a website or project like the netflix clone for example that shows that you can use um flexbox that shows that you can use react that shows that you know how to use responsive designs and css animations all without saying a single word right so like have enough of those on your projects and you you don't even have to explain at that point they kind of throw the sort of list of requirements out the window they're like whoa these projects are really nice and that kind of does the speaking for you and it gets you the interviews so having a banger portfolio is actually going to really really be something you're going to need to invest in and invest time and i see a lot of people say like i don't have time or i don't want to investigate i don't want to spend that long on my portfolio well in that case you probably are going to be stuck in a loop of like submitting hundreds of applications because you're going to keep running into a problem of trying to prove your skill especially when you haven't landed your first job so literally i landed my first job just from having like a a project and a skill like as in a project and a bunch of things on my portfolio that i was able to demo and that changed it for me yeah guys definitely don't lie on your resumes because a lot of times they're going to expose you you do not want to be in that situation so another example of a good project to build would be the amazon project that you know sonny and kazzy built as well the other day so you know these guys are going yeah m for you guys you know these guys are really teaching you skills that are very marketable and projects that a lot of people want to build right now amazon netflix all of these you know even twitter even all of these huge tech companies right now are super poppin and everybody wants to learn how to build very similar projects so you know do stick around for more of the live streams that we're gonna be having the next days so can you tell us a little bit about this amazon project sunny yeah this was dope dude like this was such a fun one and this is blowing up as well like we're really we really love how how much you guys are loving it right now but this showed like authentication the react context api which is essentially a simpler form of redux which is like uh built inhouse with react um but pretty much like with this amazon clone you could go ahead and you got a really beautiful visual interface which was responsive and then you can add things to your basket log in and then actually go to your basket and see a checkout page which updates in it dynamically right so this was um this was a really fun project logan says is that an emergency emoji inside the p tag you can do that yes you can actually put emojis inside your code and it does work um which is really cool to see but yeah guys if you do want to go check it out really good project bunch of uh like knowledge like sort of bombs in that video um it's it was definitely a really fun i couldn't believe how many people stuck it out and built the whole thing like like it was amazing to see that like and guys one thing i would say is that if you do enjoy those like literally the only reason that me kazi the rest of the guys were able to see those that you enjoyed it was because you guys tag us in stories you guys shout us out in your sort of like instagram stories and things like that so like if you do enjoy it make sure you keep doing that because we love those conversations with you guys yeah man and the reason why you want to build these type of projects is really because you want to put them put them on your portfolio right so you want to build a strong portfolio that you can share with you know recruiters with the actual employees that are going to hire you it really just serves even yourself to know what type of projects you've dealt in you know so building a strong portfolio is definitely an essential if you want to become a developer especially a selftaught developer and also having an actual website as a portfolio is huge nowadays it really helps you distinguish yourself from all the other individuals that just turn in a piece of paper that's you know that can get wrinkled that can get even stained make sure you have a website for your own portfolio exactly and guys if you do have a website top tip make sure you do what this guy did right here and it says matt farley.ca so he went ahead and bought a domain i see so many developers who have such beautiful websites but then they just deploy it on like the the default domain that they get given in like some services and it just it's like when you have such a nice portfolio but you don't link it to your own domain like it's one extra step but it does sort of tie it together so make sure you get a custom domain if you do go ahead and you should definitely build a portfolio of yourself talk um because that's going to be your sort of that's going to be your replacement for a degree guys that's going to be like your showcase that's going to be everything which is going to demonstrate why a company or a client is going to take you on and trust you with the work and trust you with that sort of responsibility so this is going to be everything for you guys yeah man i think it kind of looks a little bit ugly when you have a portfolio that says something like you know blogspot.com or like blog.com something that just doesn't you know have your own name into it just having your name yes in that url makes makes yourself a brand makes yourself way more marketable so that's a huge and important point another thing that we want to hit a big point another top skill and this is our last skill to hit you know to become a selftaught developer it's huge huge huge huge if you do want to end up landing a job if you do want to end up being part of a team if you do want to contribute to open source projects and that is going to be get guys get get get is something that you all need to know all right now like like frankie said and he i think he just summed up really well though like is literally a case of if you want to land a job if you want to work in a team if you want to contribute to open source projects you're going to need to know get now what is git it's something it's basically a version control system which is basically a way that like if you're working in a team or if you're working for a company they store all of their code in like something called a git repository so most companies will be using get if they aren't then probably don't want to work there to be honest like because it should be something which is a standard um and pretty much the things that you're going to need to know how to do are like how to create commits how to create a repo how do you actually clone a repo how do you branch and merge and things like that those are things which you're going to there's their skills which are yes they're very scary when you first get involved in it and i was very scared of learning and honestly guys in git it's very easy to think that you're going to break everything but i promise you like you can undo things in gear and something that i'd recommend is that if you're new and and you don't understand sort of or you're very new to sort of using git or version control systems maybe use like a graphical user interface such as get kraken so get kraken is a really good um sort of a git client it is paid for but there are free ones out there i'd really recommend if you're new why don't you just use a graphical user interface until you get comfortable with the command line um but definitely something that is worth worth investing your time into learning and this is going to allow you to do what um what frankie really is going to allow you to contribute to open source projects man and it's huge if you do end up you know contributing to open source projects because it's going to give you that much more leverage in an interview in finding a job just because of the fact that you know you're you're actually helping a community of coders make their software a little bit better you know and if you don't have git then it's going to be very hard for you to contribute to this exactly and actually i actually contributed to a a big open source project before is one quarter so we've used it we use it over at clever programmer but a lot of you guys might have heard of something called stripe which is a payment processor and i actually contributed code to stripe and when i did that it blew my mind because i was like i remember i was working on it and i was like yo like it doesn't they don't support what i'm trying to do right now and i was like but it really should and i was so confident i was like i was like no that i'm sure they need to have this i was using something called typescript which sits above javascript um and it didn't have the correct type definitions and things like that so i went ahead and added them and then i remember i submitted it and it blew my mind when it went inside so even to this day i get emails saying you're a moderator of the stripe repo and i was like holy crap like it really does feel nice to be part of a community and like loads of people use that stuff so like if you want to be involved in that sort of scale definitely learn gear and start contributing with open source projects really good way to find a mentor as well wow that's amazing man stripe is such a huge company it's a great company it's so it's it's interesting because it just grew so fast now it's a billion dollar company and i heard a statistic that even more than the more than 50 percent of all internet transactions in the us use stripe like wow what happened to paypal you know that's that's insane yeah that's crazy and so all of these all of these projects right here are open source projects that facebook does have right now publicly so react is one of them and we use it a lot and you know that's where we actually built the amazon clone and how we actually built the netflix clone that is kazian and sunny yeah yeah guys like and this is another thing like big companies like it's not just small projects whenever you sort of have open source projects you kind of think they're going to be small things right react react native like both are like open source you can contribute to them you can actually go ahead and like investigate on like a bugs or issues and like uh if you ever get stuck like believe me like people do actually reply and i can see graphql there graphql is another huge um sort of uh it's a massive weights or interact with your apis and stuff like that that's a huge skill that's worth learning for you guys who are selftaught right now and coming up in your journey um so definitely something to check and why are why is all of this so so valuable like at the end of this we mentioned five skills guys we mentioned like all of these different skills that you need to unlike know and sort of take into account when you're becoming a selftaught developer and the obvious end goal is to land a position or a job right so frank let's go ahead and show them what is out there and what the sort of potential looks like at the end of the road so for a frontend developer at least here in los angeles in california usa the average salary for a front end developer would be around 99 000 that is almost the six figure mark that is insane my man that's insane i mean with cash bonus that is a six figure mark like look at the cash you get bonus 3k bonus yeah and guys we're talking like massive benefits and for those of you who are outside of the us like i'm based in london like guys there is really no barrier when it comes to software development like you could be based anywhere in the world and work for like a u.s client you could be a base anywhere in the world for a london client like as long as you have internet connection and you have the skill set you are able to sell that skill right so it's something to bear in mind when you when you're looking at this like don't think that just because you're in a different country that like it doesn't apply to you it really does like it really really does and it and your skill your skill level is going to determine that so never write it off just put just think about you remember like we said get your why and understand what your end goal is and uh and focus on that and also what leads on to this guys is something like javascript so we said mastering one language right javascript is something which you can use on the front end and the back end and like let's go ahead and show you what back end developer salary looks like so look at that that's insane there we go back in developer salary yes as you were saying 121 000 a year this is obviously based here in california in la this is a huge huge huge type of salary and really it is a privilege you know to be earning that much money doing something as fun as coding and you know touching up on all the points that we did hit social skills soft skills all of these things are actually going to help you you know increase your income whether you're a frontend developer or a backend developer you can now be and have the skills to negotiate your salary you can you know say the terms that you want to work in maybe you can say oh i want to work remotely and be earning a little bit less or i want to you know work inhouse earn a little bit more or i just want to do these specific tasks i think i can be this valuable to this specific team you can now word out specifically what you want to do in that job and so that also dictates how much money you're going to earn in that current job so it's insane it just opens up opportunities for yourself yeah and we just showed you guys what a frontend developer salary is and what a backend developer salary is but remember because it's like cross like javascript goes across front and back and you can become something called a full stack developer and in most of the positions where i've been a full it's been a full stack position so basically you can actually go ahead and actually be a full stack developer and you can even learn even more than this like so it's insane what you can actually go and do and like you can go from building an apps front end so the way it looks and feels to even it like building out the back end and literally being building everything from start to finish with with something like javascript so it's definitely something which you should bear in mind the potential is there is worth investing your time in and it is going to be something which will guarantee change your life if you put in the work that's right so depending where you are in the world the actual pay is obviously going to change depending like sonny said if you're in the uk if you're in mexico you're in other parts of europe if you're in africa you're gonna have different types of pace but the cool thing about the internet is the fact that you can actually get clients anywhere in the world now and so right now with this whole you know pandemic situation going on in the world a lot of people are getting clients from other types of countries and really it's a privilege to be able to live in a country where you know living situations are not that expensive as they are here in california you know sometimes that's why salaries are so high in places like silicon valley you know san francisco all of these places just because of the fact that it's so expensive to live there you know so if you can be earning 100k let's say in virginia which is a little bit less expensive than in california that you know that difference of living of the living expenses definitely goes a long way and specifically you know maybe you're living in philippines and you want to get some clients in the u.s or you want to get some clients in europe even in mexico who knows you know it's not that expensive relative to the us to live in some place like indonesia or maybe philippines and getting clients from other types of countries is really going to open up so many doors for you open up even more business and actual more experience man you're going to connect it's going to connect you to the whole world so that's one of the privileges of having the internet exactly and guys this is like the market this is the job that like literally leverages it to the max and it takes it to a whole new level of like taking advantage of the internet so definitely something to to bear in mind and um if you guys are still wondering like like where do you get started on your journey or like where do you where can you go from here like in terms of like what we've spoke about and everything like that like we said there are so many uh free resources out there including on cleverprogrammer.com um and one which we definitely would love to mention here is that like the profit with javascript reason being guys is because literally we can take we do take you from like a complete beginner all the way to the point where you are literally uh landing your first remember what we said in the beginning knowing your why right like the viet and there was three income streams there there was like the ability to teach there was the ability to freelance and there was ability to land a permanent job right now not only like have we got our students in each one of those different areas but like we actually get a tremendous amount of students in those areas now and like i remember whenever i get messages on that it blows my mind as to sort of like what we can what we show and what we sort of see and uh guys it's definitely something to to go ahead and check out if you are interested in taking it a step further um link is in the description the first link in there make sure you go check it out and um yeah frankie what do you what do you think about what was your take on profit javascript man i love it it's it's really surprising the fact that you know sometimes our head is so stuck to the ground just you know putting in that work you know boost you know making so much content putting it out there for you guys actually articulating different projects that the masses really want to see sometimes it's crazy to see you know the actual results that we see from people and we're surprised man we forget sometimes it's like you're doing so much work on a screen that actually people reaching out to us and telling us hey i just landed a job you know my business doesn't have to suffer anymore or now i am able to feed my family now i'm able to take my my wife on a honeymoon you know all of these things that actually you know humanize the experience of us putting this content out in the world it's it's actually mindblowing and it it does feed us it does make the company even stronger even more close together it makes our mission clearer so you know we really do thank you guys for being part of the journey and really if you found this content valuable do click the description below and if you want to be part of a community like this you know profit with javascript is a perfect community like we were just mentioning man everybody is just so positive nothing like stack overflow you don't want those type of you know toxic people around you especially trying to learn something as difficult as coding because it might not be difficult but it does require a lot of focus you know you do have to put your heart into it it's not something that you're gonna just you know half ass and then be great at it you know it's it's it does it is gonna test you it it is gonna demand a lot of you and it's gonna let you know yourself to an extent that you've never really seen yourself so profit with javascript is really a prime example of really what you can be being in whatever level that you're in and you know going the long term going the long way reaching that result you have to find people likeminded like you so exactly and guys remember we touched on a point earlier about like if you like you guys here right now are watching this to invest in yourself you're investing time to watch us right now right like literally like things like popular javascript are literally like it's a it's the price of a gym membership right it's the price of gym membership and it can potentially change your entire life like and this is one thing i want to talk about when whether it comes to books or courses or anything literally like don't be afraid to invest in yourself because like we are very quick to be able to like spend money and go on a night out spend money and go on a vacation but like guys like you have to remember like in order to get the lifestyle that you want in order to under like really push your skill set to a level beyond that like investing in yourself is going to be the number one thing that you should be doing right now um so definitely definitely do if you are interested first link in the description and go and take a look at that yeah man like i was saying you know investing in yourself is really a habit it's hard for you to to start it in the beginning sometimes and so you know if you do end up betting on yourself if you do get used to you know putting your back on the wall and actually taking the action necessary because you actually put money into it now your skin is in the game you know it's it's an actual thing that we talk about here in the company a lot you know um actually being part of something and and having having you know something that you're gonna lose that you might lose if you don't take the full action that's that's a great driver for a lot of people i know it is for me and it to me personally it's one of the huge the one of the biggest drives that i can actually put myself in so now you know we we thank you guys for being here now we're gonna take a few questions please drop intelligent questions down below so that me and sunny can actually answer a few of them yeah perfect and guys like like we said like i can see a lot of comments coming in where everyone's saying like uh makko watson says kazzy sonny frankie good stuff keep it going please guys we love you guys we appreciate the support and like if you guys found this valuable the lead like all we ask is literally just smash the thumbs up button because it will help somebody else find it just as valuable and it will help change someone else's life um and to be like for the better we have one question which we can ask in the meantime while we wait for some more it's by darren watts so it's just a little bit up um and it says just a req just a question regarding um the netflix clone that you guys built and posting it inside the portfolio we're not originating that code we're recreating what you guys create how's that viewed by employers so really good question and my take on this is essentially like like although although yes technically we are sort of like you're recreating code that we've done guys it's going to actually be a case of like it's not just as easy as recreating right like a lot of people do like the reason why people message is because they get stuck because copying like a big code base like that isn't as simple as just like literally copying line for line because there are things which go wrong which takes it takes a level of understanding to actually go ahead and get that moving right like it takes level of understanding to get that working and get over that and uh frankie what's your what's your viewpoint on this in terms of um like sort of building projects for example like youtube tutorials and things like that definitely man i think that if you are building something that somebody's teaching you how to build obviously play a little with it you know have your twist to it so you know maybe maybe the interface is black play around with the colors change out the ui be like oh this looks a little bit more efficient i'm going to try this so now that you kind of have the building blocks of the whole project then you can just spice it up with your style you know and that's what's going to make you a great programmer at the end of the day you know playing with what you're given playing with the tools that you're given you know a lot of times you are working with a team so you're playing with other people's code this is a prime example of that now you have a project in your hands and then you can build it to however you want to see it you know and we right now you know have have offered a lot of great projects for you to build netflix you know covet tracker amazon all of these you can just change them up and put them on your portfolio make them even better share them with us you know share them with people help help people with that actual code you know now i do have another question here that i think it's kind of interesting just because this guy says he's been a node sorry a php developer for the last six years sunny what is your take on this node.js versus python versus php so this is a really cool question because i actually coded php for quite a while back in the day like many of you guys might not know that but yeah like i did php for a while um php did power the internet for a very long time facebook was built on php for for when when mark zuckerberg got it up and running um so my take on this guys is node.js came along and it wasn't super powerful when it first arrived but now it's it's it's it is insanely powerful like you can build entire back ends with node.js um python is something which is definitely a valuable skill guys it's really good for automation it's really good for building powerful powerful um sort of back ends and you can also go ahead and build like front ends with the sort of web development stack but i would recommend honestly at this point um i would recommend putting your time into javascript in my opinion reason being php is sort of getting sort of not i wouldn't say like deprecate but in the future years to come the market share like the number one most wanted library right now is react and that is javascript like it is such high demand and you'll see php on that list is definitely flying lower so my point is is that you want to invest your time in things which are future proofed where you're gonna have some reassurance that you know that the skills you're learning now are still gonna be sort of valuable in five ten years so my advice to that is node.js and then the runnerup being python yeah awesome yeah i myself learned some some php as well some people that say that it's super hard to learn it it's actually not that hard like and so i did that while learning a little bit of javascript to actually host servers and so you know i think it's a cool language yes it's getting a little bit outdated so do you know focus your time on something that's a little bit more relevant like javascript and that's going to be futureproof as sunny is saying i see a comment here by elijah fueller he says frankie could you promise us another video i mean my friend i really am enjoying this hopefully you know i can bring you guys a little bit more content thank you you know for for having me for sticking out this long and actually picking up a few things that me and sunny just discussed we're definitely going to have be bringing a lot of value to you guys in the future videos as well we're going to be live streaming this whole month and as of now we don't have any end date to this so it's just going to keep on coming yeah exactly we have a really good question i've seen a few people asking now react js or angular um really really nice guys um so react.js or angular my opinion react.js we teach it on the channel like that we have a bunch of uh sort of really valuable sort of resources that you guys can go ahead and check out right now for free um but my my take on this guys is because react is a library uh as compared to angular which is a framework now the difference with those two things is that it react is much more lightweight right it's much more lightweight which means the entry into it is going to be a lot easier when you're especially if you're a beginner or you're learning um and also guys huge companies are built with react like instagram tinder uber um you have like facebook facebook at the facebook react right i guess yeah tesla exactly you have all of these companies which are built with react whereas in angular it was something which which there was a there was a very high point where angular was in it was in high demand in use but now if you look at the sort of latest trends the trends flipped and reacted skyrocketing and angular and view are sort of starting to come down so like i would definitely recommend like we said before invest your time in something which is future proofed in this case react and i see assad oola says what about react native so that leads on to it if you learn react you're not only learning web development you're also learning ios and android development because if you know react you can code in react native put it that way like i i learned react and then i actually built a comp an app for a company in um in my first job and i didn't know react native i never could do it before um so yeah that would be my take on that one yeah man i think it's an interesting battle between react.js and angular i mean i feel like they're all symbiotic really it's depending on what you want to do it's interesting because react.js was made by facebook and angular is made by google so two of the biggest companies you know offered these languages or these frameworks for people to use just because they found more efficient ways to write their code and it's awesome man i know that react native is also a really good you know language to use as well if you do know react like sun is saying you can translate that to react native but react native in my opinion was really when hybrid programming hybrid you know mobile development started getting a lot of traction because other you know technologies like xamarin that were being used a lot of commercially actually didn't stick out that long so react native really gives the chance for hybrid mobile development to to come along and actually stay a little bit longer yeah really good point with xamarin by the way xamarin was really like it wasn't really pleasant to code in react it was much more of a better experience and it's quite powerful so definitely something to bear in mind guys like uh they learn over time right these things sort of they don't gain popularity for no reason they read that they are popular for a reason and uh it's definitely some it's a safe bet to go with react yeah cool there's a cool question here by monu such deva which says will dino js replace node.js what do you think about that i feel like we need to drop a video i feel like we need to drop a video around this because i see a lot of people asking yeah i'm curious as well so for those of you guys who don't know what dinojs is it's like so node.js is a runtime environment for javascript which is why you can run it on the the backend servers right so it's just an environment where you can run javascript now dino is essentially like a more modern it's newer it's more modern sort of runtime environment for javascript and the the difference here is that like one of the main differences is that out of the box it supports typescript so for those of you don't know what typescript is it's a sort of type definition um sort of uh they call it a superset it sits above javascript and allows you to say if a string is a string or if an integer is an integer as well as a bunch of other things i mean that allows your code to be more robust so will it take off i think so um but it's too early to tell um but in this like with all of this stuff guys it's like when react first view versus angular it's all going to take time and it's very opinionated is it worth learning i would say focus on node.js in my opinion yep awesome we got another comment here from shintan which says is flutter future proof i know flutter has been very popping very in inside of a lot of youtube videos a lot of youtube content i know cali halden made you know he made flutter one of the top five programming languages and flutter is developed by google what is your take on flutter sonny so flutter is actually something which i'm actually looking into learning right now um and kelly hayden's absolutely he's got some like banger videos right now with flutter um so i definitely go check him out if you're interested but um flyer is definitely it's got a lot of um it's got a lot of support right now um it has a lot of backing financially um i would i would say it's something which is a safe bet so we spoke about react native as being something which is quite like um quite good and it's going quite well but flutter right now is actually something which is very performant and it does really well in terms of like when you actually get up up up or up from running in in sort of flower but something to bear in mind guys you need to think about sort of your tradeoffs here so flutter is also in a different language i think it's in dart flutter is um so when you want to sort of if you've only got a limited time learning something like javascript and also guys remember we just spoke about react versus angular the the sort of com what's similar between those two things they're both written in javascript right so javascript's a skill it's not only is going to allow you to learn like a bunch of valuable sort of things and you can do it on the front and back end but mobile development web development is a like in most popular library up and coming like i would stick with that as my sort of goto in this sort of debate as opposed to just learning something which is kind of cool yeah that makes sense javascript is super versatile for whatever you want to do like you just mentioned you know front end back end anything related to the web it's insane now you know react native being able to even develop ios and even android apps you know hybrid mobile development that's insane so you know right now akshay does bring the question react versus flutter just because you know we like these these little verses type of questions i feel like they're kind of they give a huge insight to them what do you think about this exactly no no i definitely agree with that i definitely agree with that i think uh react versus flutter um react guys i'm gonna go with react because you can build websites you can build web uh web apps you can build ios native apps all from one code base which is amazing um leroy fernandez says a really nice coin he says sonny's amazing if only he could be a mentor to show the path engineering hardly teaches what actually matters guys so firstly thank you leroy we really appreciate uh like lovely comments like this and actually to answer your question i am actually a mentor inside a profit of javascript um so not only me you have nars you have amazing um you have everyone inside a proper javascript you have frankie you have ghazi you have everyone inside the team there and you guys can chat with us and we do pretty much mentor you and take you um and you guys you guys can pretty much have a conversation with us at any point so if you are interested link in the description but to answer your question yeah uh thank you and yeah i am a mentor awesome awesome yeah there's a lot of great mentors in profit with javascript not not only just a clever programmer team but we also have success coaches so success coaches are actually people from the community that are thriving in that community they actually have a great expertise in coding and we just bring them up in the community and make them leaders so they help other people in the community actually learn they do review their code they do teach them how to make their code more efficient how to implement things better all of these things are really part of profit with javascript like we were saying if you find this content valuable click the link in the description below and actually learn more about that specific you know product that we're offering to you guys just because like we said we've seen so many people change their lives by taking action and actually applying all of these principles being part of a community taking into account building a portfolio actually building projects that can be marketable and building all these skills all of those things are a sort of ecosystem that you surround yourself with so that you can thrive in a specific goal that you have that goal right now would be programming so that's completely awesome now we do have a question here by so and he asks which framework a beginner go through when it comes to python based like django or javascript based react js library so i think he's asking you know what what's a good framework for beginners when it comes to python maybe django or javascript you know using javascript maybe react.js library is a good thing to start as beginners what do you think about this sony yeah so i would say honestly i would definitely recommend react reason being is because like like i said guys compared to angular it's a library so it's actually like one they have a really really amazing tool called create react app which is pretty much one line of uh one line you run in the command line and it pretty much sets up your entire app gets the app running and that's it like you have a starter template up and running in like literally less than like three minutes which is insane and then all you need to do at that point is then just plug and play as you need things right you don't need to learn the entire way how react works or something like that as opposed to angular where you need to know everything before you can actually get something very small up and running so as a beginner i would definitely go for react.js yeah awesome looks like react.js is winning every battle just because of its versatility it's you know very easy way of being able to be digested and consumed and learn for beginners all these things now watch and learn only actually is asking how to understand that my vanilla vanilla js knowledge is enough for me to start learning react.js right really good question like we get it all the time in the coaching course um and i actually tell everyone like if you at this point can get a website up as in like when i literally a web page on the screen you can link your css to it you can link your javascript to it and you can pretty much write a function so when you click a button it launches your function or just says console.log something at that point guys what are you waiting for just go ahead and try to react like honestly just stop overthinking it it's not too complicated it's not too hard like just go ahead and get started so something i would recommend is like you literally go ahead and um is you just like if you're on the fence just give it a try just start use create react app it will make your life super simple especially when it comes to sort of getting involved in that and then starting off your journey but definitely um yeah something which you can get started with right now awesome guys i think we've hit a lot of questions now right now you know wrapping up everything these really were the five skills to learn if you want to become a selftaught developer in 2020 there is a lot of implications now you know it's a modern age all languages are getting modernized javascript is getting modernized with all of these new libraries these new frameworks this new way to applying to jobs right now it's an interesting time in the world you know you can get clients all over the world you can work with whatever company that you seem good fit with really and actually contribute to projects that are massive and even bigger than yourself so all these skills are super important you want to do a little a little summary of these skills saying yeah so like guys today we pretty much spoke about like the top five skills which uh you are gonna need to know as a selftaught developer to succeed um the first one was about all about communication how interpersonal skills and nonsocial are both huge and that includes soft skills like the ability to write emails blogs mediums basically communicate effectively not just in your technical skills but like in actually communicating with your team members how do you manage your time how do you handle sort of leadership roles and things like that right we spoke about that we also spoke about how to find yourself how to improve those odds by finding yourself mentor by doing things like reading medium articles etc then we spoke about number two which was learning how to learn right we spoke about time management productivity hacks how to handle the stress and anxiety of the sort of natural pitfalls of what seems to happen when you sort of start that development journey like when you get stuck on a problem and you can't figure it out we talked about how you can find your learning style how the ability to google is huge and how that's going to pretty much determine like your success as a developer because literally it's going to be something which is going to stick with you um throughout your your sort of coding journey um we gave you a bunch of tips and tricks on optimizing your workflow so you can have a bit of fun with that and also guys like creating an online presence and community and so forth number three we spoke about was debugging guys debugging is massively important it's something which you guys are all going to be stuck in for a very long time uh throughout your sort of journey and it's something which you want you want to become friends with debugging you want to become friends with that sort of pain and that sort of um and guys stop comparing to like the senior developers you will get there it just takes that sort of discipline and sort of building up uh sort of in your journey and then remember guys number four was developing a programmers mindset so develop that mindset we spoke about frankie dropped a bunch of value bombs about like how your attitude affects your behavior and that leads to sort of action results and then in turn you performing better in your role and how that's like a circular motion we spoke about those things and like getting involved in conferences you know like get a part of that build your portfolio do those things and then number five we spoke about get and why it's so massively important to land a job um because it's something which you're going to need in pretty much every workplace it's going to it's going to most companies use it like if they don't remember you don't really kind of want to be part compile companies like that um you and you need it to contribute to open source projects so guys massive massive amount of value and and knowledge that was dropped during this session if you guys found it useful smash the thumbs up and guys can we just drop like some fire right now in the comment section because like and this is all goes towards frankie because this session was super valuable and it's been frankie's first live and i think he's crushed it here guys and if you guys agree with that like drop him some comments and just like he has exactly rush this live stream like you guys have crushed this live stream this is like one of the best ones we have ever done on this channel thank you guys and like i can tell everybody's getting value you guys almost broke uh almost 10 000 people have watched this so far which is insane and you guys have been sticking around the entire time like it has never dropped below certain and i'm even looking at chat it's going crazy the value bombs in this one were amazing guys should frankie come back on this platform to speak you let us know tell us in the comments below thank you guys so much yeah we did discuss a lot of things it's it's insane man a lot of factors a lot of skills it's cool because everything is just coming together now you know you guys are killers in programming you guys are killers and communication i mean honestly the whole team is and it's really a privilege to be able to share this knowledge with hundreds hundreds hundreds and even thousands of people man it really is a privilege it really does humble me thank you guys for being here you know all of these skills all of these factors we do teach them in profit with javascript which you know we really want to make the community massive we really want to bring value to the masses and actually make programming fun make programming something that can be attainable and actually be able to you know show this in a way that can be digested really simple and like i said you know we want to build a great community if you want to be part of that community make sure to go into the link in the description below just because we've seen so much success in this you know specific program in this community like i said it's only going to keep growing it's only going to keep getting better make sure to be around these type of people and yeah i thank you guys so much enjoy thank you so much and like qazi says we'll see you in the next video next thank you sunny exactly thank you guys peace out
