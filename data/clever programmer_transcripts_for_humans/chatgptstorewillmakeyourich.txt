With timestamps:

00:00 - GPT store just
00:03 - launched this is the same as when Chrome
00:08 - extension if we went back in the day and
00:10 - imagine the Chrome extension store was
00:13 - just about to launch or the WordPress
00:16 - plug-in store was just about to launch
00:19 - or the App Store on your iPhone was just
00:22 - about to launch so it's a really big
00:25 - moment in time it's a historical moment
00:27 - that we're actually seeing happen kind
00:29 - kind of in front of us or in a few days
00:31 - it's going to be happening there was an
00:33 - email that open a sent out and I think
00:37 - everybody got this email but it
00:39 - basically goes hey dear GPT Builder we
00:43 - want to let you know that we will be
00:45 - launching the GPT store next week if
00:48 - you're interested in sharing your GPT in
00:50 - the store you'll need to and then they
00:53 - gave instructions for it okay now if
00:56 - you're interested and curious how to
00:59 - make your yours I'll also show you and
01:01 - walk you through that but what's
01:03 - important for you to know is that this
01:05 - is an opportunity for you to learn have
01:08 - fun
01:09 - mostly okay because I'll show you
01:11 - something funny which is how much money
01:13 - do developers make and there's a funny
01:15 - SL sad Reddit I found because we talk a
01:18 - lot about how much money you could make
01:20 - right but there's also another side of
01:22 - the truth which is there are a lot of
01:24 - developers who are not making money so
01:26 - there's a Reddit here it's like hey how
01:29 - much money you earn with your apps
01:31 - somebody commented and then look at
01:34 - these comments right you got people
01:35 - going about a negative, thousand sounds
01:38 - about right negative 1,000 per day or
01:40 - per month in two years and so and this
01:45 - guy got a lot of upvotes so that tells
01:47 - you that there's a lot of people who are
01:48 - failing and not able to make money with
01:51 - coding but this is just the truth with
01:53 - everything in life most people are
01:55 - losers most people will not win most
01:58 - people by definition will be average so
02:00 - there will be a few who will just take
02:02 - it all and so the question is
02:05 - are you one of them or are you one of
02:07 - the
02:08 - others and I hope that if you're
02:11 - watching my channel you're not a
02:13 - loser you're a winner and that's my
02:16 - belief in myself and I hope you believe
02:18 - that in you too because I believe in you
02:20 - all right so let's go back to this okay
02:23 - now let's say you wanted to build your
02:25 - own GPT well here's how you can actually
02:29 - do it there's a simple process so if you
02:31 - actually went to Chad GPT you could
02:34 - build your own bot and uh right now at
02:37 - least in the UI there's an explore
02:39 - button that you could click right and
02:41 - then after you go to the explore button
02:42 - you click create a GPT it's in beta
02:45 - version now but pretty soon it won't be
02:48 - and it could be whatever for example one
02:51 - of the ones I made because I sent out a
02:53 - lot of emails is I made a email crafter
02:56 - and that's just for me and it does makes
02:59 - my email writing easier because it
03:02 - understands how I write
03:04 - emails another bot that I actually
03:06 - recently built is this clever programmer
03:08 - one and I actually use it all the time
03:10 - cuz something I hate about Chad GPT is
03:13 - every single time I try to talk to it
03:16 - youve probably experienced this too it
03:18 - gives you a lot of random explanations
03:21 - it gives you
03:22 - disclaimers you'll be like hey what's 5
03:25 - + 5 and it will be like I'm not a
03:28 - mathematician or a law
03:30 - but 5 + 5 is equal to 10 and here's a
03:36 - disclaimer do your own research look up
03:39 - on Google because answers in different
03:41 - countries based on if you're Europe or
03:43 - Canada might be different and you're
03:44 - like what the dude like just shut
03:47 - the up give me 10 and so I can just
03:50 - go on my way right that's what you want
03:52 - that's what I want and so I I usually
03:55 - hate regular CH GPT cuz it's so verbos
03:57 - and disclaimer and long sentenc and I
04:01 - just want things like when I ask it how
04:02 - many calories are in you know how many
04:06 - calories do I burned with 500 steps
04:08 - don't need something long just give me
04:10 - something like 1,000 calories something
04:14 - 200 calories something that's direct so
04:16 - what I did is I made my own bot clever
04:18 - programmer and what that does I'm not
04:21 - promoting my own bot by the way so just
04:23 - relax but what this bot does
04:26 - is it is very direct and concise I just
04:29 - taught it hey I want you to just give
04:31 - short direct concise answers and don't
04:35 - drag out keep it simple keep it
04:37 - succinct and keep it to the point just
04:38 - that's it don't give long explanations
04:41 - unless explicitly asked and whenever
04:44 - users ask give them the full code don't
04:47 - hide Snippets of code and that's baked
04:50 - into it at the core level which means
04:52 - now whenever I use chat GPT and I use
04:54 - this
04:55 - bot all my answers are super short and
04:58 - direct so really valuable chatbot that I
05:01 - made in probably 5 minutes and now I can
05:05 - link it to anybody and people can use it
05:08 - right so that way you can make your own
05:09 - Bots as well okay so you make your Bot
05:13 - and then this is what the bot Builder
05:16 - looks like it's pretty simple what's
05:18 - cool is you don't even have to do any
05:20 - complicated stuff like you don't even
05:21 - have to fill out like this form that you
05:23 - see here you don't even have to do any
05:24 - of that you just talk to this bot
05:26 - Builder over here and what you wanted to
05:27 - do you you're like make sentences short
05:31 - and boom it puts it writes a description
05:35 - for you it automatically writes the
05:37 - instructions for you it writes the
05:39 - conversation starts for you it writes
05:41 - the name of the bot for you it even
05:43 - updates the profile
05:45 - picture uh of the bot for you like it
05:49 - even like this is a for example from a
05:51 - clever programmer bot I mean how cool is
05:54 - that it it makes it look so cool and it
05:56 - has the Q cuz ky ky I called it the pzy
05:59 - bot so it took this AI
06:02 - photo where uh it made it look like this
06:05 - nice little queue which is super cool so
06:07 - it does everything for you like creates
06:09 - all the marketing branding material
06:11 - right so how nice of a time is this that
06:14 - to build your own app you just say some
06:17 - stuff you don't have to even write code
06:20 - you don't have to go through the Swift
06:22 - Apple Market and SDK and fight the
06:25 - Chrome extension store just do it in one
06:28 - go okay now
06:30 - what's the benefit of all this why would
06:33 - we even do this well check this out
06:34 - right here's an example of Chrome
06:36 - extensions and I wanted to share this
06:38 - with you guys because I think it's
06:39 - important to kind of get the picture of
06:40 - this like what's the opportunity there
06:42 - for the ones who would take it
06:45 - all here's the opportunity here's an
06:48 - example of eight Chrome extensions with
06:51 - impressive revenue and these are by
06:53 - Indie developers okay so somebody
06:55 - decided to make an app well here are
06:57 - some crazy apps these are ridiculous but
07:00 - grammarly is a Chrome extension by the
07:02 - way they raised $90 million and they are
07:06 - $1 billion valuation Chrome
07:11 - extension gmass okay another Chrome
07:14 - extension these guys are making about
07:16 - $130,000 per month so that's do the math
07:20 - but well over $1 million per year you
07:25 - got another app in the Chrome Store
07:27 - which is closet tools these guys make
07:31 - $442,000 per
07:33 - month and check it out it's an extension
07:37 - that helps users automate posting on the
07:39 - fashion reselling Marketplace
07:43 - Poshmark I mean could you be any more
07:45 - Niche like what the like this is the
07:47 - craziest Niche I've
07:50 - seen and at $30 per month they're making
07:52 - $42,000 per month doesn't it make you
07:54 - ask like what are we doing like why
07:57 - aren't we building more Chrome
07:59 - extensions right and there's so many
08:01 - more CSS scan it helps you scan and
08:05 - modify rules CSS rules on web pages
08:08 - 100,000 Go full page 10,000 per month
08:11 - screen capture app screen capture app
08:15 - that just lets you screen capture a full
08:16 - page 10,000 per month that is 120,000
08:21 - per year off of a screen capture
08:24 - app point and click web scraper 10K in 2
08:28 - months
08:30 - right and there's so many more black
08:32 - magic 3K per month this is a little tool
08:36 - for Twitter that helps users with
08:39 - Twitter okay weather extension 2500 per
08:43 - month I mean ridiculous right absolutely
08:46 - ridiculous so this is an example of just
08:49 - with Chrome extensions what's happening
08:52 - now you're looking at Chad GPT which
08:54 - probably would even have more users than
08:56 - almost anything might have more users
08:58 - than actually
09:00 - Chrome and all those people building
09:03 - apps on there uh and and mostly a lot of
09:06 - those people are users so imagine you
09:09 - build something that a lot of these
09:11 - users could use it would be lifechanging
09:15 - for you right it could bring in a lot of
09:18 - revenue for you so my recommendation to
09:22 - you is start learning Chad GPT start
09:25 - learning how to build
09:28 - apps with AI because you can be part of
09:33 - you know the gold shovel fir ship in his
09:35 - videos uh Tong and cheek also talks
09:38 - about the gold shovel right selling the
09:41 - gold shovel and he's like you can make a
09:42 - million per month which is I know he did
09:44 - it in humor
09:47 - but you might not be the person that
09:50 - might make a million per month but you
09:51 - don't you might also not need to be
09:53 - right would you be happy if your app
09:54 - made $3,000 a month or $5,000 a month or
09:57 - $10,000 a month $150,000 a month a lot
10:01 - of people would be very happy and more
10:03 - more importantly than even that just
10:05 - think about the skill that you get out
10:06 - of it think about how it looks on your
10:08 - resume and your portfolio that you're
10:10 - trying to build this and just how fun it
10:12 - is to be a part of something so new that
10:15 - is happening right
10:17 - now here's what I would say Okay explore
10:20 - this learn it because I think the
10:22 - opportunity is huge if you want to be
10:24 - part of my community part of all the
10:27 - people that are learning Ai and CH GPT
10:29 - and building incredible apps and
10:31 - actually even selling these apps that
10:33 - are part of my community in the course
10:35 - profit with the Chad GPT I've put
10:37 - together an incredible free training for
10:39 - you that shows you your AI and CH GPT
10:42 - apps that you could build right now I'll
10:44 - give you three ideas for free of apps
10:47 - you could use right now and I'll show
10:50 - you how you can monetize it in your own
10:54 - life and do that now so if that sounds
10:57 - interesting to you I've put together
10:59 - there a very short 19-minute free
11:01 - training for you and if you click the

11:09 - live training that I'm going to be doing
11:11 - and so if you join it I'm going to be
11:12 - there giving you the training live that
11:15 - will be super valuable to you okay and I
11:19 - think it has a potential to change your
11:20 - life especially with Chad GPT store
11:24 - coming out in a few days if you watch it
11:26 - now it could give you the lens to look
11:29 - at the world from where you can be one
11:32 - of the people that could be actually
11:34 - extracting value out of this and be one
11:36 - of the people that could be in the 100K
11:39 - you know hopefully the 130k per month
11:42 - category but again even if you're not
11:45 - 10K a month 5K a month all of that is a
11:48 - substantial amount so if that's exciting
11:50 - to you and you want to learn how to
11:51 - build apps chpt click the link below

Cleaned transcript:

GPT store just launched this is the same as when Chrome extension if we went back in the day and imagine the Chrome extension store was just about to launch or the WordPress plugin store was just about to launch or the App Store on your iPhone was just about to launch so it's a really big moment in time it's a historical moment that we're actually seeing happen kind kind of in front of us or in a few days it's going to be happening there was an email that open a sent out and I think everybody got this email but it basically goes hey dear GPT Builder we want to let you know that we will be launching the GPT store next week if you're interested in sharing your GPT in the store you'll need to and then they gave instructions for it okay now if you're interested and curious how to make your yours I'll also show you and walk you through that but what's important for you to know is that this is an opportunity for you to learn have fun mostly okay because I'll show you something funny which is how much money do developers make and there's a funny SL sad Reddit I found because we talk a lot about how much money you could make right but there's also another side of the truth which is there are a lot of developers who are not making money so there's a Reddit here it's like hey how much money you earn with your apps somebody commented and then look at these comments right you got people going about a negative, thousand sounds about right negative 1,000 per day or per month in two years and so and this guy got a lot of upvotes so that tells you that there's a lot of people who are failing and not able to make money with coding but this is just the truth with everything in life most people are losers most people will not win most people by definition will be average so there will be a few who will just take it all and so the question is are you one of them or are you one of the others and I hope that if you're watching my channel you're not a loser you're a winner and that's my belief in myself and I hope you believe that in you too because I believe in you all right so let's go back to this okay now let's say you wanted to build your own GPT well here's how you can actually do it there's a simple process so if you actually went to Chad GPT you could build your own bot and uh right now at least in the UI there's an explore button that you could click right

Niche like what the like this is the craziest Niche I've seen and at $30 per month they're making $42,000 per month doesn't it make you ask like what are we doing like why aren't we building more Chrome extensions right and there's so many more CSS scan it helps you scan and modify rules CSS rules on web pages 100,000 Go full page 10,000 per month screen capture app screen capture app that just lets you screen capture a full page 10,000 per month that is 120,000 per year off of a screen capture app point and click web scraper 10K in 2 months right and there's so many more black magic 3K per month this is a little tool for Twitter that helps users with Twitter okay weather extension 2500 per month I mean ridiculous right absolutely ridiculous so this is an example of just with Chrome extensions what's happening now you're looking at Chad GPT which probably would even have more users than almost anything might have more users than actually Chrome and all those people building apps on there uh and and mostly a lot of those people are users so imagine you build something that a lot of these users could use it would be lifechanging for you right it could bring in a lot of revenue
