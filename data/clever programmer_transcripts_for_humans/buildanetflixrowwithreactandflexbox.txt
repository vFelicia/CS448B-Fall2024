00:00 - wow it's really sick right you get a
00:03 - really nice user interface
00:05 - and you get bigger posters at the top
00:07 - and guys
00:08 - this is all using the same component so
00:11 - i really want to stress that
00:12 - [Music]
00:14 - what i'm going to do now is i'm going to
00:15 - create a row.css file so i think i might
00:18 - be able to say row.css
00:20 - nice yep so we create a row.css
00:24 - and if i go to the top and i import that
00:26 - file
00:27 - so this is a benefit of using components
00:30 - because now we can only
00:31 - we can have all of our uh row css inside
00:34 - of uh
00:34 - its own file which is neat so
00:38 - let's go ahead and actually style that
00:40 - so let me just check something so
00:42 - row right so what we need to do here
00:45 - is basically i'm going to actually so
00:47 - all of these posters right
00:49 - i want to just style them a little bit
00:50 - so i'm going to go here i'm basically
00:52 - going to say all of the row posters
00:54 - i want to do a neat little trick so i
00:55 - want to say the width
00:58 - is going to be a hundred percent right
01:00 - so it's only going to use up 100 of the
01:02 - screen
01:03 - um rather than what doing what it's
01:04 - doing now so you see now it's corrected
01:06 - and it's sort of fitting within the
01:07 - screen right
01:08 - oh i'm also going to add another rule so
01:10 - i'm going to say object
01:12 - fit so this is a really trick
01:15 - object fit contain will keep the aspect
01:18 - ratio so regardless of how i move it and
01:20 - shape it and size it
01:22 - it's going to keep that looking really
01:24 - really nice thing i want to do
01:26 - okay yep is is it
01:30 - is it working your object contain thing
01:33 - yeah so the reason why it's not changing
01:35 - anymore is because remember the width is
01:36 - 100
01:37 - so it's good so it's using up 100 but
01:39 - aspect ratio is
01:40 - still correct but where that comes into
01:42 - play
01:43 - is when i actually say a set of max
01:45 - height so here if i say max
01:47 - height of 100 pixels and i save this now
01:50 - check this out oh nice okay
01:55 - so we have a quite a nice looking thing
01:57 - there
01:58 - yeah what we're trying to get it to just
02:01 - so we can
02:02 - all visually see it is like we're trying
02:05 - to get it to look like this
02:07 - you know but right now we have
02:10 - right now we have a giant column but
02:13 - essentially we need to turn it into
02:15 - a row like that yeah
02:18 - so the way we do that now is if we go to
02:21 - remember we actually surrounded all
02:23 - everything inside of
02:25 - a container called row posters right
02:28 - so i'm gonna go ahead this thing
02:31 - is in a container called row posters and
02:34 - so basically what we're gonna do
02:35 - is maybe drop in flexbox
02:38 - and then make it like all column based
02:41 - so flexbox will allow us to just do it
02:43 - with like
02:44 - literally two lines and then boom we'll
02:46 - go from column to
02:48 - a row yeah so if we
02:51 - i'll comment it out and then i'll
02:52 - uncomment it and show what it does
02:54 - so let's have the app running
02:57 - so the locals yeah so without flexbox it
03:00 - does this
03:01 - if as soon as i add flexbox into the
03:03 - container look what happens
03:06 - boom so there we go remove that flexbox
03:09 - let's see that in action again that is
03:11 - sick
03:11 - so flexbox is so nice you guys it makes
03:14 - your life
03:14 - so damn easy do that again
03:18 - exactly so as soon as i uncomment that
03:20 - look boom
03:21 - it's gonna just change everything so now
03:24 - we actually have a really nice starting
03:26 - point everything's looking good
03:28 - um i guess what we should do next is
03:31 - i like to add a little sort of
03:32 - transition effect to the poster
03:35 - so that way if it ever changes size it
03:37 - will do it in a really slow way
03:39 - so that's basically just saying if we
03:40 - ever change the size for any reason
03:42 - add a little transition so it basically
03:45 - just takes
03:46 - four i think that's four and a half so
03:48 - 450 so it's like
03:49 - just under half a second i think um and
03:52 - they'll basically just nicely
03:54 - sort of change size um and then what i'm
03:57 - going to do
03:58 - is i'm going to add a margin right to
04:00 - everything so right now you see all the
04:01 - pictures are touching each other right
04:03 - yeah everything's touching each other
04:05 - but we kind of want to have this
04:06 - oh remove that again so do it a few
04:09 - times whenever you do these changes do
04:11 - it a few times like repeat it a few
04:13 - times so you can visually see it
04:15 - yeah nice okay love that you see that
04:19 - it's a really nice sort of effect right
04:20 - and then it
04:21 - sort of then it stops everything from
04:22 - touching um nice
04:24 - and what we're gonna do next is we're
04:26 - also gonna add a hover effect so i'm
04:29 - going to go over here and i'm going to
04:30 - say row
04:31 - poster oops and i'm going to say
04:34 - when you hover over it yeah i want to do
04:36 - the following
04:37 - so i want it to kind of grow a little
04:39 - bit right so i want to say here when you
04:42 - say grow
04:43 - what do you mean by that you mean like
04:45 - so when you say row
04:46 - row you literally mean this thing right
04:48 - when i hover over this
04:50 - boom does that nice little so
04:53 - basically now what we're trying to do is
04:55 - build that experience in our app because
04:57 - ours doesn't have that when i hover over
04:59 - it just kind of very static
05:01 - sits there but we want ours to grow
05:05 - exactly that and right now what we
05:08 - want to do is remember we added that
05:10 - transition so it means if we ever change
05:12 - the size
05:13 - it's going to actually so anytime we use
05:16 - the transform
05:17 - effect so i'm going to use that here so
05:18 - i'm going to say transform and scale
05:21 - to 1.08 of your size which is just like
05:24 - a sweet spot yeah it's a very light
05:26 - light light amount so i just tested this
05:28 - out before so it's a very light light
05:30 - sweet spot here
05:31 - and then we're going to say opacity one
05:32 - um so that i can actually get rid of i
05:34 - don't need that right now
05:35 - um yeah so what we're going to do now is
05:37 - if we go over it because i've
05:39 - combined this with transition so i'm
05:41 - saying
05:42 - apply a very small delay so don't just
05:44 - pop up and be bigger so we'll show that
05:46 - effect in action so if you just hover
05:48 - over
05:49 - oh look at that that is
05:53 - really nice remove that trash
05:57 - if i get rid of the transition look what
05:59 - happens it'll snap so that
06:00 - oh that looks clunky yeah it looks
06:03 - horrible right but if you had a slight
06:05 - delay
06:06 - this transition then look how silky
06:08 - smooth it looks oh
06:09 - that is silky smooth but with so little
06:13 - like that
06:14 - and that thing right there that is nice
06:17 - it's crazy right that is beautiful so on
06:19 - hover you guys that's what's happening
06:21 - that's cool and the actual app the
06:24 - header and everything stays there
06:27 - and just this thing moves
06:30 - um and also just that row moves actually
06:33 - i just realized nothing else
06:34 - moves just that road that's really cool
06:37 - so here this entire app moves rather
06:40 - than the row
06:42 - yeah so we want to keep it we want to
06:43 - kind of keep that straight forward there
06:46 - so
06:46 - the way we do that is we go over to our
06:49 - container
06:50 - uh which is row posters and we add this
06:52 - rule here we say overflow y
06:54 - should be hidden so that's we're saying
06:57 - the
06:57 - vertical axes if there's any sort of
06:59 - room to for for a little scroll bar but
07:01 - we want to hide that
07:02 - and then we're going to say the x axis
07:05 - should now be a scroll
07:07 - right so now look what happens yeah it
07:10 - threw in a scroll bar
07:14 - nice that is so clean all right
07:17 - that a padding of 20 pixels so that
07:20 - when it grows it's gonna grow and you
07:22 - can see the growth so that now if you
07:24 - hover over it
07:28 - and now it doesn't crop you see that
07:30 - it's not cropping the tops off
07:32 - yeah right but if i get rid of that
07:34 - padding look what happens
07:36 - yeah it's going to crop it zooms in and
07:38 - it crops out yeah i see
07:40 - i see what you're saying yeah you have
07:42 - to like if you're going to do a
07:43 - transform you're going to have to pad
07:45 - your container
07:46 - yeah so that's the first thing but if
07:48 - you notice in netflix like in our clone
07:50 - we didn't have that
07:51 - little scroll bar because to be honest
07:53 - it looks a little bit ugly right
07:55 - yeah that's why yeah yeah so
07:58 - what you need to do is you need to
07:59 - basically do this special rule you need
08:01 - to say
08:02 - row posters uh so row posters and then
08:06 - you say
08:07 - colon codon and you say webkit so it's
08:10 - webkit so i think it's dash
08:12 - webkit and then it's dash
08:15 - scroll bar and then here
08:19 - you basically are saying your bait this
08:21 - is basically a rule to say
08:23 - tell all of the browsers so whether it
08:26 - be in
08:26 - edge chrome firefox whatever you're
08:29 - using
08:30 - display none so this is saying don't
08:33 - ever display
08:34 - your scroll bars but keep the
08:35 - functionality of it
08:39 - nice that is clean no more scroll bars
08:44 - so that way it looks really nice right
08:46 - yeah so that's
08:47 - that's really cool so then we get that
08:49 - working and everything sort of nice in
08:51 - that front
08:52 - now what we're going to do and this is
08:54 - going to blow your mind a little bit
08:55 - so we've basically just set up the row
08:59 - right we've set up a row it seems to be
09:01 - all good everything seems to be nice
09:03 - um what we're going to do is we're
09:05 - actually going to do a little
09:06 - optimization here so
09:08 - in react whenever we render a big list
09:10 - so in this case
09:11 - i know it doesn't sound like a lot but
09:13 - when you've got 20 items
09:15 - in a row and then you've got a bunch of
09:16 - those rows we should be rendering it in
09:18 - the most efficient way and react has
09:20 - something called a key
09:22 - right and here if you pass you just need
09:24 - to pass
09:25 - some unique information here which is
09:27 - unique to that specific
09:29 - in our case each of those pictures we
09:31 - need to give it like an identity right
09:33 - so that way
09:34 - if anything changes in that row react
09:37 - doesn't simply re-render the entire row
09:39 - it just re-renders what it needs to
09:41 - re-render right so and what we can do
09:43 - here is we can say movie
09:44 - dot id because each of those movies that
09:47 - came back actually had their own id
09:49 - yeah so we can go ahead and do that and
09:51 - that will fix it for us
09:53 - so if i do this and save it now what you
09:56 - can see is it
09:57 - you wouldn't know it's much but it's
09:58 - actually a slightly bit faster than what
10:00 - it was before
10:01 - nice right so it's a small optimization
10:04 - step that you do
10:06 - so we're going to have a little bit of
10:07 - magic here where we're basically we've
10:09 - just built
10:10 - a bunch of components and we built in
10:12 - such a way
10:13 - that it's going to be really impressive
10:15 - to show you something now so if i go
10:17 - ahead
10:18 - and i just paste these components out so
10:20 - inside of the app
10:22 - the really nice thing now is we have a
10:23 - bunch of different categories so we've
10:24 - got trending now
10:26 - we have top rated so top braided just to
10:29 - be clear i'm gonna
10:30 - say here so they can see it so we have
10:34 - top rated which is going to be this
10:35 - category right here
10:38 - what's the next i think it's action
10:39 - movies action movies right there
10:43 - there's comedy movies yep
10:47 - then it's horror movies
10:52 - there we go and here what we're going to
10:54 - do is we are going to add in the
10:56 - appropriate requests so this is another
10:59 - example of if you build something right
11:01 - it's actually going to be very easy and
11:03 - it's going to make your life super easy
11:05 - when it comes to doing it i just need to
11:06 - get the request to my screen because i
11:07 - don't get the auto complete
11:08 - uh some reason um so let me go ahead and
11:11 - open up requests
11:13 - so now let's go ahead and pop these in
11:15 - so we've got
11:16 - fetch top rated so this one's top rated
11:20 - fetch and guys you can start from the
11:21 - bottom and i'll start from the top
11:24 - uh you can start popping them in if you
11:26 - want follow us i'll stop following you
11:30 - oh yeah so fetch action movies
11:34 - comedy and horror movies
11:41 - there we go so that one's documentaries
11:43 - and that one's because this is how you
11:45 - guys are going to see it
11:46 - so romance that one is yep and then the
11:49 - final one is horror movies
11:51 - so i think let's swap this one out
11:54 - so this one is dot uh
11:58 - fetch horror movies awesome
12:01 - uh now if i just click save the whole
12:04 - app
12:05 - the whole half is literally gonna do his
12:07 - magic
12:08 - oh
12:15 - that's so cool that just worked
12:20 - just clean it just works look at that
12:22 - hover over it
12:24 - so nice yeah
12:27 - so now what we're gonna do is let's go
12:29 - over to app.css
12:30 - so when you actually start off guys i
12:32 - want you to get rid of this stuff
12:34 - so go ahead and clear out after css it
12:36 - will change the look and feel of your
12:37 - app
12:38 - but we don't want to have anything
12:39 - inside of our app what i would recommend
12:41 - is you go inside here and you add this
12:44 - one rule
12:45 - which does this we say margin 0.
12:48 - so because by default the browsers give
12:49 - you this weird margin so if you notice
12:51 - on the right where cause he's
12:52 - got the preview open as soon as i add
12:54 - this wrong i save
12:56 - look at the imaginary margins are going
12:57 - to disappear right
12:59 - see that it gets rid of all those
13:01 - imaginary margins right and we just
13:02 - don't want those to start with because
13:04 - we don't want to deal with them um
13:07 - so that's something just a side note you
13:08 - want to get i love that
13:11 - just get rid of that stuff and then that
13:13 - way all of your styling is going to be
13:14 - all of your actual styling it's not
13:16 - going to be getting rid of things
13:17 - index.css you can leave this stuff this
13:19 - is just going to be some fun
13:20 - stuff so unless you change the fonts
13:22 - i'll just keep this um
13:24 - css i would change okay so now with that
13:27 - said we've got a nice looking app
13:29 - but uh if you know it's the app that we
13:31 - saw earlier
13:32 - uh so we had the the netflix originals
13:35 - were bigger
13:36 - than the trending now top braided so we
13:38 - had larger tiles
13:39 - so notice how the those you see the
13:42 - tiles here are bigger
13:44 - right so let's go down so notice how the
13:47 - tiles are bigger
13:48 - and also if you look a bit further down
13:51 - you'll see on trending now we don't
13:53 - actually
13:54 - have uh the posters we have these other
13:57 - thumbnails right yeah yeah
14:00 - so we need to fix this and but we want
14:02 - to use the same component
14:04 - but we just want to have a slight
14:05 - variation what i'm going to do now
14:07 - is i'll show you how we can actually do
14:09 - that so for that bigger one
14:12 - what we're going to do is we're going to
14:13 - pass in a is
14:15 - large row so is large row right
14:19 - and by default what this means is it
14:21 - means true but you don't actually have
14:22 - to write that
14:23 - um so we're going to pass this in so if
14:26 - we go over to row
14:27 - i'm going to go and pull in that prop so
14:29 - we're pulling that in
14:30 - and now i'm basically going to render
14:33 - the styles
14:34 - based on this so the first difference i
14:36 - want to have
14:37 - is rather than having a poster i want to
14:39 - have it so that
14:42 - if the if we're using a large row don't
14:45 - use the poster part but use the back
14:48 - is something called the backdrop part so
14:50 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to say
14:51 - if you're using a large row then use the
14:53 - poster path
14:54 - otherwise use the movie dot backdrop
14:58 - path and this will make sense in a sec
15:00 - when we save it so as soon as i save
15:01 - this
15:02 - notice on the right now all of the
15:04 - trending now top rated and everything
15:06 - look what happens you see that
15:10 - looking nice yeah but the sizing is
15:13 - is the opposite way now so we want those
15:15 - to be smaller and the other one to be a
15:17 - bit bigger
15:17 - right yeah so the way we fix that
15:21 - is we go over to our row.css and i just
15:24 - need to do a few different rules now so
15:26 - firstly i need to apply a class name
15:29 - based on which one was actually coming
15:31 - in so what i'm going to do here is i'm
15:32 - going to do some string concatenation so
15:34 - i'm going to do this so i'm just going
15:35 - to do a little change
15:36 - a tweak here i'm going to say everything
15:39 - gets a row poster class
15:41 - everything gets the original roll poster
15:43 - but if it's a large row
15:45 - so if it's a large row then i'm going to
15:48 - give it
15:49 - an additional sort of class called roll
15:52 - poster
15:55 - and what this is going to do is we're
15:57 - going to style it basically and say you
15:59 - get the bigger styles
16:00 - if you are a larger row right so if we
16:03 - go into row.css
16:06 - now i'm going to say is that the
16:09 - larger rows are going to get a
16:12 - max height of 250 pixels
16:15 - but they're going to get slightly bigger
16:16 - so if you see the normal rows got 100
16:18 - pixels but the bigger one
16:20 - is going to get a 250 pixel limit so
16:23 - this is going to be the netflix original
16:25 - one
16:26 - yeah so now you see that right yep
16:29 - they're a bit bigger and then we go over
16:32 - here and we say row
16:33 - and then i'm going to add another hover
16:35 - rule so just like we done here
16:37 - but instead i'm going to say this one
16:39 - gets a slightly bigger hover
16:40 - so it's not naught point it's one it's
16:42 - not point zero eight
16:44 - it's point zero nine instead right oh
16:47 - and this one
16:49 - so now check this out look at that so
16:52 - now if you do that
16:55 - it's really thick right you get a really
16:56 - nice user interface and
16:58 - you get bigger posters at the top and
17:00 - guys this is
17:01 - all using the same component so i really
17:04 - want to stress that
17:05 - so now we have a oh just by passing in
17:07 - one prop
17:08 - we can differentiate if if that row is a
17:11 - large row or if it's a spoiler
17:29 - you

Cleaned transcript:

wow it's really sick right you get a really nice user interface and you get bigger posters at the top and guys this is all using the same component so i really want to stress that what i'm going to do now is i'm going to create a row.css file so i think i might be able to say row.css nice yep so we create a row.css and if i go to the top and i import that file so this is a benefit of using components because now we can only we can have all of our uh row css inside of uh its own file which is neat so let's go ahead and actually style that so let me just check something so row right so what we need to do here is basically i'm going to actually so all of these posters right i want to just style them a little bit so i'm going to go here i'm basically going to say all of the row posters i want to do a neat little trick so i want to say the width is going to be a hundred percent right so it's only going to use up 100 of the screen um rather than what doing what it's doing now so you see now it's corrected and it's sort of fitting within the screen right oh i'm also going to add another rule so i'm going to say object fit so this is a really trick object fit contain will keep the aspect ratio so regardless of how i move it and shape it and size it it's going to keep that looking really really nice thing i want to do okay yep is is it is it working your object contain thing yeah so the reason why it's not changing anymore is because remember the width is 100 so it's good so it's using up 100 but aspect ratio is still correct but where that comes into play is when i actually say a set of max height so here if i say max height of 100 pixels and i save this now check this out oh nice okay so we have a quite a nice looking thing there yeah what we're trying to get it to just so we can all visually see it is like we're trying to get it to look like this you know but right now we have right now we have a giant column but essentially we need to turn it into a row like that yeah so the way we do that now is if we go to remember we actually surrounded all everything inside of a container called row posters right so i'm gonna go ahead this thing is in a container called row posters and so basically what we're gonna do is maybe drop in flexbox and then make it like all column based so flexbox will allow us to just do it with like literally two lines and then boom we'll go from column to a row yeah so if we i'll comment it out and then i'll uncomment it and show what it does so let's have the app running so the locals yeah so without flexbox it does this if as soon as i add flexbox into the container look what happens boom so there we go remove that flexbox let's see that in action again that is sick so flexbox is so nice you guys it makes your life so damn easy do that again exactly so as soon as i uncomment that look boom it's gonna just change everything so now we actually have a really nice starting point everything's looking good um i guess what we should do next is i like to add a little sort of transition effect to the poster so that way if it ever changes size it will do it in a really slow way so that's basically just saying if we ever change the size for any reason add a little transition so it basically just takes four i think that's four and a half so 450 so it's like just under half a second i think um and they'll basically just nicely sort of change size um and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to add a margin right to everything so right now you see all the pictures are touching each other right yeah everything's touching each other but we kind of want to have this oh remove that again so do it a few times whenever you do these changes do it a few times like repeat it a few times so you can visually see it yeah nice okay love that you see that it's a really nice sort of effect right and then it sort of then it stops everything from touching um nice and what we're gonna do next is we're also gonna add a hover effect so i'm going to go over here and i'm going to say row poster oops and i'm going to say when you hover over it yeah i want to do the following so i want it to kind of grow a little bit right so i want to say here when you say grow what do you mean by that you mean like so when you say row row you literally mean this thing right when i hover over this boom does that nice little so basically now what we're trying to do is build that experience in our app because ours doesn't have that when i hover over it just kind of very static sits there but we want ours to grow exactly that and right now what we want to do is remember we added that transition so it means if we ever change the size it's going to actually so anytime we use the transform effect so i'm going to use that here so i'm going to say transform and scale to 1.08 of your size which is just like a sweet spot yeah it's a very light light light amount so i just tested this out before so it's a very light light sweet spot here and then we're going to say opacity one um so that i can actually get rid of i don't need that right now um yeah so what we're going to do now is if we go over it because i've combined this with transition so i'm saying apply a very small delay so don't just pop up and be bigger so we'll show that effect in action so if you just hover over oh look at that that is really nice remove that trash if i get rid of the transition look what happens it'll snap so that oh that looks clunky yeah it looks horrible right but if you had a slight delay this transition then look how silky smooth it looks oh that is silky smooth but with so little like that and that thing right there that is nice it's crazy right that is beautiful so on hover you guys that's what's happening that's cool and the actual app the header and everything stays there and just this thing moves um and also just that row moves actually i just realized nothing else moves just that road that's really cool so here this entire app moves rather than the row yeah so we want to keep it we want to kind of keep that straight forward there so the way we do that is we go over to our container uh which is row posters and we add this rule here we say overflow y should be hidden so that's we're saying the vertical axes if there's any sort of room to for for a little scroll bar but we want to hide that and then we're going to say the x axis should now be a scroll right so now look what happens yeah it threw in a scroll bar nice that is so clean all right that a padding of 20 pixels so that when it grows it's gonna grow and you can see the growth so that now if you hover over it and now it doesn't crop you see that it's not cropping the tops off yeah right but if i get rid of that padding look what happens yeah it's going to crop it zooms in and it crops out yeah i see i see what you're saying yeah you have to like if you're going to do a transform you're going to have to pad your container yeah so that's the first thing but if you notice in netflix like in our clone we didn't have that little scroll bar because to be honest it looks a little bit ugly right yeah that's why yeah yeah so what you need to do is you need to basically do this special rule you need to say row posters uh so row posters and then you say colon codon and you say webkit so it's webkit so i think it's dash webkit and then it's dash scroll bar and then here you basically are saying your bait this is basically a rule to say tell all of the browsers so whether it be in edge chrome firefox whatever you're using display none so this is saying don't ever display your scroll bars but keep the functionality of it nice that is clean no more scroll bars so that way it looks really nice right yeah so that's that's really cool so then we get that working and everything sort of nice in that front now what we're going to do and this is going to blow your mind a little bit so we've basically just set up the row right we've set up a row it seems to be all good everything seems to be nice um what we're going to do is we're actually going to do a little optimization here so in react whenever we render a big list so in this case i know it doesn't sound like a lot but when you've got 20 items in a row and then you've got a bunch of those rows we should be rendering it in the most efficient way and react has something called a key right and here if you pass you just need to pass some unique information here which is unique to that specific in our case each of those pictures we need to give it like an identity right so that way if anything changes in that row react doesn't simply rerender the entire row it just rerenders what it needs to rerender right so and what we can do here is we can say movie dot id because each of those movies that came back actually had their own id yeah so we can go ahead and do that and that will fix it for us so if i do this and save it now what you can see is it you wouldn't know it's much but it's actually a slightly bit faster than what it was before nice right so it's a small optimization step that you do so we're going to have a little bit of magic here where we're basically we've just built a bunch of components and we built in such a way that it's going to be really impressive to show you something now so if i go ahead and i just paste these components out so inside of the app the really nice thing now is we have a bunch of different categories so we've got trending now we have top rated so top braided just to be clear i'm gonna say here so they can see it so we have top rated which is going to be this category right here what's the next i think it's action movies action movies right there there's comedy movies yep then it's horror movies there we go and here what we're going to do is we are going to add in the appropriate requests so this is another example of if you build something right it's actually going to be very easy and it's going to make your life super easy when it comes to doing it i just need to get the request to my screen because i don't get the auto complete uh some reason um so let me go ahead and open up requests so now let's go ahead and pop these in so we've got fetch top rated so this one's top rated fetch and guys you can start from the bottom and i'll start from the top uh you can start popping them in if you want follow us i'll stop following you oh yeah so fetch action movies comedy and horror movies there we go so that one's documentaries and that one's because this is how you guys are going to see it so romance that one is yep and then the final one is horror movies so i think let's swap this one out so this one is dot uh fetch horror movies awesome uh now if i just click save the whole app the whole half is literally gonna do his magic oh that's so cool that just worked just clean it just works look at that hover over it so nice yeah so now what we're gonna do is let's go over to app.css so when you actually start off guys i want you to get rid of this stuff so go ahead and clear out after css it will change the look and feel of your app but we don't want to have anything inside of our app what i would recommend is you go inside here and you add this one rule which does this we say margin 0. so because by default the browsers give you this weird margin so if you notice on the right where cause he's got the preview open as soon as i add this wrong i save look at the imaginary margins are going to disappear right see that it gets rid of all those imaginary margins right and we just don't want those to start with because we don't want to deal with them um so that's something just a side note you want to get i love that just get rid of that stuff and then that way all of your styling is going to be all of your actual styling it's not going to be getting rid of things index.css you can leave this stuff this is just going to be some fun stuff so unless you change the fonts i'll just keep this um css i would change okay so now with that said we've got a nice looking app but uh if you know it's the app that we saw earlier uh so we had the the netflix originals were bigger than the trending now top braided so we had larger tiles so notice how the those you see the tiles here are bigger right so let's go down so notice how the tiles are bigger and also if you look a bit further down you'll see on trending now we don't actually have uh the posters we have these other thumbnails right yeah yeah so we need to fix this and but we want to use the same component but we just want to have a slight variation what i'm going to do now is i'll show you how we can actually do that so for that bigger one what we're going to do is we're going to pass in a is large row so is large row right and by default what this means is it means true but you don't actually have to write that um so we're going to pass this in so if we go over to row i'm going to go and pull in that prop so we're pulling that in and now i'm basically going to render the styles based on this so the first difference i want to have is rather than having a poster i want to have it so that if the if we're using a large row don't use the poster part but use the back is something called the backdrop part so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say if you're using a large row then use the poster path otherwise use the movie dot backdrop path and this will make sense in a sec when we save it so as soon as i save this notice on the right now all of the trending now top rated and everything look what happens you see that looking nice yeah but the sizing is is the opposite way now so we want those to be smaller and the other one to be a bit bigger right yeah so the way we fix that is we go over to our row.css and i just need to do a few different rules now so firstly i need to apply a class name based on which one was actually coming in so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to do some string concatenation so i'm going to do this so i'm just going to do a little change a tweak here i'm going to say everything gets a row poster class everything gets the original roll poster but if it's a large row so if it's a large row then i'm going to give it an additional sort of class called roll poster and what this is going to do is we're going to style it basically and say you get the bigger styles if you are a larger row right so if we go into row.css now i'm going to say is that the larger rows are going to get a max height of 250 pixels but they're going to get slightly bigger so if you see the normal rows got 100 pixels but the bigger one is going to get a 250 pixel limit so this is going to be the netflix original one yeah so now you see that right yep they're a bit bigger and then we go over here and we say row and then i'm going to add another hover rule so just like we done here but instead i'm going to say this one gets a slightly bigger hover so it's not naught point it's one it's not point zero eight it's point zero nine instead right oh and this one so now check this out look at that so now if you do that it's really thick right you get a really nice user interface and you get bigger posters at the top and guys this is all using the same component so i really want to stress that so now we have a oh just by passing in one prop we can differentiate if if that row is a large row or if it's a spoiler you
