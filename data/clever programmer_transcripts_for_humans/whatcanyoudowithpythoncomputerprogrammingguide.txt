With timestamps:

00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up? How's it going?
00:01 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:06 - In this video I wanna talk to you guys
00:08 - about what can you do with Python.
00:11 - I get this question quite a bit
from people from everywhere.
00:16 - Even though I talk
about it so much, right?
00:19 - So, in this video we're
going to get a little bit
00:22 - more specific about what
you can do with Python,
00:24 - what your options are, whether
you're in college right now
00:29 - or not, whether you're trying
to find work as a freelancer,
00:33 - become an independent contractor,
00:34 - or find a full time position
working with Python,
00:39 - I have your answers in this
video so lets get started
00:42 - without any further ado.
00:45 - (upbeat rap music)
00:57 - So, Python, as I like to put
is at the perfect intersection
01:01 - of the most paid, one of the most growing,
01:05 - and one of the easiest
programming languages.
01:08 - So when I say "most paid" I don't mean
01:10 - "Oh, hands down you're
always paid the most",
01:13 - I mean, like, it ranks at the top, right?
01:16 - Compared to other famous
programming languages
01:19 - like JavaScript, Python
is right next to it.
01:22 - Especially in terms of how
much the developers get paid
01:26 - on average or at the higher ends.
01:29 - The reason why I say it's easy, right?
01:32 - Is because this programming
language is super, super simple.
01:37 - The syntax - very, very simple.
01:39 - It was actually made for kids to learn,
01:42 - then it evolved into an
actual programming language
01:45 - of it's own, and now
anywhere from little children
01:49 - to people in NASA actually use it.
01:52 - Now, getting more specific
about what you could do with it.
01:56 - You could do data science
with Python, okay?
01:59 - So people in, even companies like NASA
02:05 - or companies where there's a lot
02:07 - of artificial intelligence stuff going on,
02:09 - even at Amazon they could use Python.
02:11 - Also, Python, you could
use for web development.
02:14 - And a lot of people
actually use it for that.
02:17 - Believe it or not, YouTube
is built off of Python.
02:20 - Instagram is built off of Python.
02:23 - Spotify is built off of Python.
02:26 - So there are a lot of big
companies that are actually
02:30 - using Python, right, to actually
grow their entire companies
02:35 - and make their websites,
their backend, using Python.
02:42 - There's certain frameworks
in Python that you can use
02:44 - if you want to get a
little bit more technical,
02:46 - and look at that beautiful sun just
02:48 - making it look really nice.
02:50 - You know, the frameworks are like Django.
02:53 - You have frameworks like Flask.
02:55 - These are frameworks that allow you to do
02:57 - web development with Python,
and then on the front end
03:00 - you can use whatever you want.
03:02 - I don't want to get too
technical because I don't
03:04 - want to confuse anybody,
you know, depending on
03:06 - whatever your level is and
you're watching this video,
03:08 - I just want to give you a general overview
03:10 - of what you can do with Python.
03:12 - Other fancy things that you
can do that are exciting for me
03:16 - as well are things like machine learning.
03:18 - When you're building these
algorithms and you're trying
03:20 - to build these, like, bots
that can actually figure out
03:22 - and learn things on their own.
03:23 - Like, have you ever seen those videos?
03:25 - You have this bot, and then he falls down,
03:27 - and then he gets up and
then he falls down again
03:30 - and he gets up and after he
falls down like a thousand times
03:33 - he actually figures out how to walk.
03:35 - He basically teaches himself.
03:37 - Or, a chess computer, right?
Like artificial intelligence.
03:40 - A chess computer that
becomes the best chess player
03:44 - in the world in 24 hours
by just playing with itself
03:48 - over and over again
and learning from that.
03:51 - That's again, AI.
03:54 - How about Mario? That's neuro-something,
03:58 - I forget the actual word for it.
03:59 - But basically what they
do is you have Mario
04:02 - and the computer goes
through the game of Mario,
04:05 - plays this level over and
over again until he can be
04:08 - the best Mario player in the world, right?
04:12 - This is stuff that you could
actually do with Python, okay?
04:16 - So this is the machine
learning realm of it.
04:19 - And it doesn't have to
be with physical things,
04:21 - you could it with things
like, you know Amazon
04:23 - how it recommends you things
that you don't even think of?
04:26 - These are called recommendation systems,
04:28 - and Netflix has the same
recommendation systems now as well
04:32 - which suggests to you movies
or suggests to you products
04:36 - that you didn't even know that you needed
04:39 - because it knows you so well.
04:41 - Well, guess what, on
the backend there's some
04:43 - heavy machine learning going on.
04:45 - So Python is great for that.
04:46 - How about when on your
phone, iPhone, you take a lot
04:50 - of photos and you go on your Google app,
04:53 - it categorizes pictures
based on people's names.
04:57 - So, if your friend is
Johnny, it'll like have
05:00 - a section called Johnny,
you could click there
05:02 - and it recognizes all of them.
05:03 - Well, guess what it's doing?
05:04 - It's actually recognizing Johnny right?
05:07 - By his face. That's image recognition.
05:09 - That is also something
you could do with Python.
05:12 - You can do digit recognition,
how things are written.
05:17 - Hand written stuff, it's very
complicated for a computer
05:22 - to understand what that
digit might be, right?
05:25 - With a high confidence interval,
05:27 - you can do it with Python, right?
05:29 - If you learn machine
learning you can actually
05:30 - overcome that problem and
actually build something
05:33 - that can actually recognize
digits for written things.
05:36 - For example, remember
when we always had to go
05:39 - to the bank to deposit a check?
05:41 - Well a lot of you probably still do that.
05:43 - But, what's a cooler way of doing it now?
05:45 - You take a picture and
it's something also called
05:47 - edge detection, right,
it detects the edges
05:49 - of the check, that's your image detection.
05:51 - And then it detects your
handwriting that says
05:54 - how much the check is
for, then it automatically
05:58 - gets deposited into your bank.
06:00 - So that's actually image
recognition, right?
06:02 - And then digit, like, character
06:05 - or handwriting recognition
in there as well.
06:07 - So that's a lot of that
machine learning segment
06:10 - which I find very fascinating.
06:13 - But I never spent too much
time into it, you know?
06:16 - You could even do, you
could do all kinds of stuff.
06:19 - So that is one world you
can go into with Python.
06:22 - My world, and what I teach, is different.
06:27 - What I talk about is web development.
06:30 - So now you're more along
the routes of, you know,
06:34 - how you actually build
these amazing websites,
06:36 - the databases behind them,
and how you can actually
06:40 - make these apps, and how
you can actually make this
06:42 - for yourself, and how you can actually
06:44 - make this for other people as well.
06:46 - That's a side of Python
that I actually like a lot,
06:48 - which is just, like,
web development, right?
06:51 - And in web development
you're not pigeon-holed
06:53 - into anything specific.
06:55 - You can do web development
and go into data science.
06:58 - You can do web development
and go into machine learning.
07:02 - You can do web development and go
07:04 - into other fields like data analysis.
07:06 - So, data analysis is a whole nother field,
07:11 - which is a lot about having
data and analyzing it, okay?
07:17 - So, you basically have a lot
of this, a lot of numbers.
07:21 - Maybe terabytes or petabytes of data.
07:24 - Depending on what company
you're working with,
07:26 - depending on whose your client,
07:28 - if you're doing stuff with, like,
07:30 - I don't know, what's going on in space?
07:32 - You're gonna be dealing with probably
07:34 - petabytes worth of data.
07:37 - But regardless, what you're
doing a lot of the times
07:41 - in data analysis, you have a lot of data
07:44 - and you have to make meaning out of it.
07:45 - And then what you wanna
do, is also give it
07:48 - some kind of visual representation.
07:51 - Because if you don't visualize the data,
07:53 - it doesn't mean anything,
it's gonna be very confusing.
07:56 - You know, like for example,
you're working with a company
08:00 - and you're trying to find
out, like, are they making
08:01 - enough sales, is their
conversion rate high enough?
08:04 - So what you'll do is you'll
gather a lot of data points
08:08 - of people coming into the website,
08:10 - landing on the checkout
page, how many of the people
08:13 - that are landing on the
checkout page versus
08:15 - how many are actually buying
from the checkout page.
08:18 - You know, that's something
that's a little bit simple
08:21 - and you could probably
just tell somebody, like,
08:22 - "Hey, your conversion rate is,
like zero point five percent,
08:25 - or two percent," which is,
you know, for a sales page
08:27 - a pretty good conversion
rate for those of you guys
08:30 - who are interested in business.
08:32 - Now this is something simple
you can tell somebody,
08:34 - but not if you have really
complicated data, right?
08:37 - Something like, I don't
know, that requires
08:39 - calculus or beyond,
multi variant calculus,
08:43 - something even beyond
that, that you can't really
08:45 - understand from intuition,
so you need to create
08:48 - these graphs, these charts, right?
08:49 - That look beautiful, that make meaning.
08:51 - This is the simplest way that
I can give you data analysis.
08:55 - There's the data analysis
portion, and if you actually
08:59 - specialize in data analysis,
making meaning from the data,
09:03 - you could actually just be
a specialist in that, okay?
09:07 - Also, you could be a specialist
in data visualization.
09:11 - So, you could just be
that person that goes,
09:12 - "Hey, look, you don't need
to worry about how to make
09:15 - this data tell a story.
You just give me the data,
09:17 - and I'll do all the
graphics part of it, right?
09:21 - And give this data a story."
09:23 - An analogy I can give you
is something like you have
09:26 - a director who maybe comes
up with the entire story
09:29 - and, like, what happens
but it's kind of all
09:30 - inside his head, you know, it makes sense
09:32 - but it's maybe inside his head.
09:34 - And then you have somebody
like a cinematographer
09:36 - who actually, like, brings
this to life, right?
09:39 - Who actually shoots it,
who sets up the camera
09:42 - in a specific spot, all that.
09:44 - Or you have somebody who
storyboards everything that's
09:47 - in that director's mind so it's
actually visualized, right?
09:50 - It's actually out of
his mind and visualized.
09:52 - So that's the difference between somebody
09:53 - who's a data analyst versus somebody who
09:56 - actually visualizes the
data. You can also be both.
10:00 - So that's another field you can get into.
10:02 - You know, with Python a
lot of people will tell you
10:04 - it's really heavy on,
or quantitative, right?
10:07 - It's really heavy quantitatively,
meaning there's a lot
10:10 - of things you can do with numbers.
10:11 - And that's certainly true,
but, you know web development
10:15 - is not so quantitative you know.
10:17 - That's what I like about web development.
10:19 - It's something I can see, I
can touch, I can move around.
10:22 - And you can really pick it
up a lot from just intuition.
10:26 - Because you, and I, we go through
websites every single day.
10:31 - We look at apps and use
apps every single day.
10:34 - So you and I are actually
experts in apps and websites.
10:39 - So now, if you actually
pick up web development
10:42 - it will come a lot more naturally to you
10:44 - and it'll be more, like, intuitive.
10:46 - Again, another reason why I
like web development so much,
10:49 - it's easy, it's intuitive, and developers
10:52 - get paid a lot of money.
10:54 - Even Python developers, Flask developers,
10:57 - or Django developers get
paid in the average range
11:00 - of above 80 thousand dollars
or 90 thousand dollars a year.
11:05 - You're getting paid good
money as a web developer
11:07 - and it's something that's a
little bit easier to pick up.
11:10 - That's how I personally was able
11:12 - to pick up computer programming and become
11:16 - a developer in a few shorts months.
11:19 - Now, I am a bit of an
anomaly because I was working
11:23 - about 17 hours a day, right,
so that's absolutely insane.
11:28 - I had no life at the time.
11:30 - But, because I was going
into more of, like,
11:32 - the web development field,
I was able to find work
11:35 - a lot easier and without
needing, you know, like, a PhD.
11:40 - And having all this like,
needing all this experience.
11:44 - If you go for web development
you don't need a lot of like,
11:47 - you don't need a degree, you
don't need a PhD all the time,
11:50 - you don't even need
experience to get started.
11:53 - And when I say "get
started", I don't mean like
11:55 - as an intern, you can actually
get started getting paid
12:00 - as long as you can start
working with that first client.
12:03 - And then, your experience
actually matters a lot more
12:06 - than your qualifications.
12:08 - Because it's not a very academic field.
12:10 - So, that's my personal taste.
12:11 - That's personally what
I like a lot, you know.
12:13 - If you're actually
interested in learning about
12:16 - how you can create apps,
if this is something
12:19 - you're interested in, right,
you wanna create web apps,
12:22 - you want to become a
developer, maybe you want to
12:24 - get a job as a Python developer.
12:28 - If this is something that excites you,
12:29 - I have a course that I launch
after every few months.
12:33 - I'm gonna put the link somewhere here.
12:36 - And you can actually type
this link in or click it
12:40 - in the description, okay?
12:42 - And when you sign up for
this VIP wait list, you'll be
12:46 - the first one to find out
when this course is open.
12:50 - Also, I'll send you my
bonuses for how I became
12:53 - a software developer in
less than three months.
12:55 - So you can steal my exact roadmap,
12:57 - and that's all free by the
way, it's free to sign up,
13:00 - and you get my resources for free.
13:02 - And all the resources that
I give you that I used
13:04 - to become a developer in
less than three months,
13:06 - those resources are also free.
13:10 - So, it's really a win-win here,
13:12 - and that's what my course is about, right?
13:15 - It's just about teaching
you web development
13:17 - if that's something that you're actually
13:19 - interested in learning,
that's what I go through.
13:22 - I teach you how you can
have your own portfolio,
13:26 - where you can actually
find your first clients,
13:29 - and how you can actually go
about making your very own apps
13:33 - and that are online, okay?
13:35 - So, then you can actually
start to build a portfolio,
13:38 - you learn how to create apps
and then you can actually
13:40 - offer this as a service to other people.
13:45 - So if this is something
that interests you,
13:47 - you know, go ahead, click that below.
13:49 - Hopefully I covered kind
of everything for you.
13:52 - One resource that's extra
that I want to give you,
13:55 - is if you're into data
science or machine learning
13:57 - or whatever, there's a channel
by the name of Siraj Raval.
14:00 - You should check that out,
it's a very cool channel.
14:03 - And if data science and
machine learning is a route
14:05 - that you wanna go down,
go to that channel, okay?
14:09 - Check it out, you're gonna love it.
14:11 - Other than that, if you like this video,
14:14 - hit that "like" button, okay?
14:16 - It's hard to make this
video, and my friend here
14:19 - has been walking forever, backwards, okay?
14:22 - And his arms are super sore, okay?
14:25 - So the least you can do, after
watching this amazing video
14:29 - is just please hit that "like"
button, that'd be great.
14:32 - Subscribe to this channel,
we will constantly,
14:35 - every week, Monday at 11
A.M. you'll be getting
14:38 - fresh new content every single
week on this channel, okay?
14:44 - For free, obviously,
it's gonna be on YouTube.
14:47 - Other than that, sign up, okay?
14:50 - For my course that's coming
up so when it gets launched
14:53 - you're the first one to know.
14:54 - And it's the most sexiest, most badass,
14:56 - amazing course available on the market.
14:59 - I know, because I've been through Udacity,
15:02 - I've been through Coursera,
15:03 - I've been through every course
you can imagine on Udemy,
15:06 - I've been through every
course you can imagine
15:07 - on Team Treehouse, Codecademy,
as a matter of fact
15:10 - I have my own course on
Codecademy that ranks higher
15:13 - than the Codecademy courses.
15:16 - So if you go on YouTube and
type in Codecademy Python
15:18 - that's gonna actually rank number one.
15:21 - So, I've been through a lot of courses,
15:22 - I've built a lot of courses.
15:24 - This, by far, you know,
is my best course called
15:27 - "Create Apps with Python
and Land your First Client".
15:30 - I wanna see you inside here, signing up.
15:33 - Thank you for watching this video.
15:34 - As always, I love your faces off,
15:36 - and I'll see you in the next video.
15:39 - (heavy bass beat)

Cleaned transcript:

Hey guys, what's up? How's it going? This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com. In this video I wanna talk to you guys about what can you do with Python. I get this question quite a bit from people from everywhere. Even though I talk about it so much, right? So, in this video we're going to get a little bit more specific about what you can do with Python, what your options are, whether you're in college right now or not, whether you're trying to find work as a freelancer, become an independent contractor, or find a full time position working with Python, I have your answers in this video so lets get started without any further ado. (upbeat rap music) So, Python, as I like to put is at the perfect intersection of the most paid, one of the most growing, and one of the easiest programming languages. So when I say "most paid" I don't mean "Oh, hands down you're always paid the most", I mean, like, it ranks at the top, right?

But I never spent too much time into it, you know? You could even do, you could do all kinds of stuff. So that is one world you can go into with Python. My world, and what I teach, is different. What I talk about is web development. So now you're more along the routes of, you know, how you actually build these amazing websites, the databases behind them, and how you can actually make these apps, and how you can actually make this for yourself, and how you can actually make this for other people as well. That's a side of Python that I actually like a lot, which is just, like, web development, right? And in web development you're not pigeonholed into anything specific. You can do web development and go into data science. You can do web development and go into machine learning. You can do web development and go into other fields like data analysis. So, data analysis is a whole nother field, which is a lot about having data and analyzing it, okay? So, you basically have a lot of this, a lot of numbers. Maybe terabytes or petabytes of data. Depending on what company you're working with, depending on whose your client, if you're doing stuff with, like, I don't know, what's going on in space? You're gonna be dealing with probably petabytes worth of data. But regardless, what you're doing a lot of the times in data analysis, you have a lot of data and you have to make meaning out of it. And then what you wanna do, is also give it some kind of visual representation. Because if you don't visualize the data, it doesn't mean anything, it's gonna be very confusing. You know, like for example, you're working with a company and you're trying to find out, like, are they making enough sales, is their conversion rate high enough? So what you'll do is you'll gather a lot of data points of people coming into the website, landing on the checkout page, how many of the people that are landing on the checkout page versus how many are actually buying from the checkout page. You know, that's something that's a little bit simple and you could probably just tell somebody, like, "Hey, your conversion rate is, like zero point five percent, or two percent," which is, you know, for a sales page a pretty good conversion rate for those of you guys who are interested in business. Now this is something simple you can tell somebody, but not if you have really complicated data, right? Something like, I don't know, that requires calculus or beyond, multi variant calculus, something even beyond that, that you can't really understand from intuition, so you need to create these graphs, these charts, right? That look beautiful, that make meaning. This is the simplest way that I can give you data analysis. There's the data analysis portion, and if you actually specialize in data analysis, making meaning from the data, you could actually just be a specialist in that, okay? Also, you could be a specialist in data visualization. So, you could just be that person that goes, "Hey, look, you don't need to worry about how to make this data tell a story. You just give me the data, and I'll do all the graphics part of it, right? And give this data a story." An analogy I can give you is something like you have a director who maybe comes up with the entire story and, like, what happens but it's kind of all inside his head, you know, it makes sense but it's maybe inside his head. And then you have somebody like a cinematographer who actually, like, brings this to life, right? Who actually shoots it, who sets up the camera in a specific spot, all that. Or you have somebody who storyboards everything that's in that director's mind so it's actually visualized, right? It's actually out of his mind and visualized. So that's the difference between somebody who's a data analyst versus somebody who actually visualizes the data. You can also be both. So that's another field you can get into. You know, with Python a lot of people will tell you it's really heavy on, or quantitative, right? It's really heavy quantitatively, meaning there's a lot of things you can do with numbers. And that's certainly true, but, you know web development is not so quantitative you know. That's what I like about web development. It's something I can see, I can touch, I can move around. And you can really pick it up a lot from just intuition. Because you, and I, we go through websites every single day. We look at apps and use apps every single day. So you and I are actually experts in apps and websites. So now, if you actually pick up web development it will come a lot more naturally to you and it'll be more, like, intuitive. Again, another reason why I like web development so much, it's easy, it's intuitive, and developers get paid a lot of money. Even Python developers, Flask developers, or Django developers get paid in the average range of above 80 thousand dollars or 90 thousand dollars a year. You're getting paid good money as a web developer and it's something that's a little bit easier to pick up. That's how I personally was able to pick up computer programming and become a developer in a few shorts months. Now, I am a bit of an anomaly because I was working about 17 hours a day, right, so that's absolutely insane. I had no life at the time. But, because I was going into more of, like, the web development field, I was able to find work a lot easier and without needing, you know, like, a PhD. And having all this like, needing all this experience. If you go for web development you don't need a lot of like, you don't need a degree, you don't need a PhD all the time, you don't even need experience to get started. And when I say "get started", I don't mean like as an intern, you can actually get started getting paid as long as you can start working with that first client. And then, your experience actually matters a lot more than your qualifications. Because it's not a very academic field. So, that's my personal taste. That's personally what I like a lot, you know. If you're actually interested in learning about how you can create apps, if this is something you're interested in, right, you wanna create web apps, you want to become a developer, maybe you want to get a job as a Python developer. If this is something that excites you, I have a course that I launch after every few months. I'm gonna put the link somewhere here. And you can actually type this link in or click it in the description, okay? And when you sign up for this VIP wait list, you'll be the first one to find out when this course is open. Also, I'll send you my bonuses for how I became a software developer in less than three months. So you can steal my exact roadmap, and that's all free by the way, it's free to sign up, and you get my resources for free. And all the resources that I give you that I used to become a developer in less than three months, those resources are also free. So, it's really a winwin here, and that's what my course is about, right? It's just about teaching you web development if that's something that you're actually interested in learning, that's what I go through. I teach you how you can have your own portfolio, where you can actually find your first clients, and how you can actually go about making your very own apps and that are online, okay? So, then you can actually start to build a portfolio, you learn how to create apps and then you can actually offer this as a service to other people. So if this is something that interests you, you know, go ahead, click that below. Hopefully I covered kind of everything for you. One resource that's extra that I want to give you, is if you're into data science or machine learning or whatever, there's a channel by the name of Siraj Raval. You should check that out, it's a very cool channel. And if data science and machine learning is a route that you wanna go down, go to that channel, okay? Check it out, you're gonna love it. Other than that, if you like this video, hit that "like" button, okay? It's hard to make this video, and my friend here has been walking forever, backwards, okay? And his arms are super sore, okay? So the least you can do, after watching this amazing video is just please hit that "like" button, that'd be great. Subscribe to this channel, we will constantly, every week, Monday at 11 A.M. you'll be getting fresh new content every single week on this channel, okay?

And it's the most sexiest, most badass, amazing course available on the market. I know, because I've been through Udacity, I've been through Coursera, I've been through every course you can imagine on Udemy, I've been through every course you can imagine on Team Treehouse, Codecademy, as a matter of fact I have my own course on Codecademy that ranks higher than the Codecademy courses. So if you go on YouTube and type in Codecademy Python that's gonna actually rank number one. So, I've been through a lot of courses, I've built a lot of courses. This, by far, you know, is my best course called "Create Apps with Python and Land your First Client". I wanna see you inside here, signing up. Thank you for watching this video. As always, I love your faces off, and I'll see you in the next video. (heavy bass beat)
