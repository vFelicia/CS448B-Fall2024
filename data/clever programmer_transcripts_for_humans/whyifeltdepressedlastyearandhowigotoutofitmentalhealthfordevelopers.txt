00:00 - what's up boys and girls this is qazi
00:02 - from clever programmer
00:04 - i hope you're excited we're about to
00:05 - start dropping a bunch of content
00:07 - and um i want to talk about something
00:09 - important today which is mental health
00:11 - for
00:12 - developers this has been something
00:13 - that's on my mind for a while
00:15 - it's mental health in general but i want
00:19 - to speak specifically to you guys so you
00:21 - guys can relate to it as well
00:22 - um before we get into this video just do
00:24 - me a favor smash that like button so
00:26 - this video goes out to more people and
00:28 - so we can help more people and more
00:29 - developers
00:30 - in general and with that said let's get
00:32 - right into it
00:33 - mental health is one of those things
00:34 - that is extremely important but often
00:36 - times not talked about enough or
00:38 - oftentimes
00:39 - very stigmatized so when people are
00:42 - suffering with things that are in their
00:44 - head they don't actually know how to
00:46 - deal with it
00:47 - and they also don't know where to go and
00:49 - ask for help
00:50 - and especially if you're in a male
00:52 - dominant dominated community like
00:54 - development or your friends are all
00:56 - males around you and
00:57 - i don't necessarily think just males are
00:59 - like this but generally
01:01 - they're a little bit more insensitive
01:03 - and they your friends won't
01:04 - you know care they'll be like haha like
01:06 - just toughen up
01:07 - you're just being a little [ __ ] and
01:09 - you're like no actually
01:11 - there are things that actually need
01:12 - space and i need time to come out and
01:14 - think about things
01:15 - and get into a different mental state
01:17 - it's one of those things that
01:19 - if your head is not in the right place
01:21 - like for example i'll tell you right
01:22 - like
01:23 - last year in 2019 i'm the type of person
01:26 - that's always happy
01:27 - always smiling always grateful doesn't
01:30 - matter what has happened to me right
01:31 - even when i was
01:32 - young and i went to a religious school
01:35 - between the ages of 9 and 12 years old
01:36 - and i was
01:37 - beat every single day um the school was
01:40 - between 8 am to 10
01:42 - pm so it was 12 to 14 hours long often
01:45 - times
01:45 - and if i got beat up really bad and i
01:47 - had bruises and i went home
01:49 - and the teachers would beat you up there
01:50 - and if i told my parents
01:52 - i would come back and i would get beaten
01:54 - up even more so it was better to just
01:55 - not tell anybody
01:56 - and i had to go to that for three to
01:58 - four years and so there are a lot of
01:59 - things that happen to me
02:01 - but i feel like maybe i got lucky in the
02:03 - process or whatever happened
02:05 - but my normal became yo if i wake up and
02:07 - i'm not getting beat my
02:08 - like the [ __ ] beat out of me it's a good
02:11 - day i'm happy
02:12 - let's go let's work let's come up with
02:14 - something i see the world as like a
02:16 - playground
02:17 - and i just see that there's so much
02:19 - opportunity and possibilities and
02:22 - if you imagine a cake right there's a
02:24 - giant cake
02:26 - i imagine that the world is not just one
02:28 - giant cake where if you keep taking out
02:29 - the cake runs
02:30 - out i imagine there are like infinite
02:32 - cakes that are out there
02:33 - and i and i imagine that the world shows
02:36 - you how to make as many cakes as you
02:38 - want
02:38 - so there's enough for every single
02:41 - person right
02:42 - if you become successful doesn't mean i
02:44 - can't become successful
02:45 - if i become successful doesn't mean you
02:48 - can't become successful so sometimes
02:50 - people think
02:51 - somebody's success will hurt or hinder
02:53 - theirs
02:54 - and that's also not true so for me to
02:57 - come you know spend that much time and
02:59 - be grateful and i always feel like i'm
03:01 - always happy and
03:02 - in a good state of mind but last year
03:05 - i was in a state of mind where i
03:07 - remember waking up
03:08 - and not wanting to get out of bed i
03:10 - remember i would try to stay in bed as
03:12 - long as i possibly could
03:14 - and i remember that when i would get out
03:17 - i
03:18 - would sit there and think like why am i
03:20 - feeling sad
03:21 - why am i not feeling happy why do i feel
03:25 - like literally like [ __ ] like i don't
03:27 - want to do anything
03:29 - and i remember this is there's just one
03:31 - thing that i would always do to get out
03:33 - of pretty much any state
03:34 - there are a lot of things that i like to
03:35 - do like i love to play table tennis i
03:37 - love to play chess i love to play
03:39 - pool snooker bowling uh
03:42 - soccer you know there's like bunch of
03:44 - things coding like
03:46 - there's a bunch of stuff that i like to
03:48 - do if i sit there and i
03:49 - i normally go through them and i'm like
03:51 - okay you know what even though i don't
03:53 - feel like working today even though i
03:54 - don't feel like doing all these other
03:56 - things today
03:56 - i feel like playing ping pong or i feel
03:58 - like bowling and that centers me and i
04:00 - go okay
04:01 - i can still be happy okay cool let me
04:02 - just go do that and when i do that i
04:04 - come back i'm happy and i'm a completely
04:06 - different state of mind that day what
04:09 - happened
04:10 - was i looked at myself and i remember
04:14 - going through the list of every single
04:16 - thing and there was not a single thing
04:18 - that made me happy
04:19 - or that made me feel okay i looked in
04:22 - the mirror and i kept looking at myself
04:24 - and i remember my face kind of just
04:25 - started getting distorted
04:28 - and i started materials started
04:30 - streaming down and i couldn't control
04:31 - them
04:31 - i just started crying and i kept i
04:34 - actually just kept verbally asking like
04:36 - what is wrong with me why do i feel like
04:38 - this why do i feel
04:40 - unhappy and i just kept and i felt like
04:42 - i was broken
04:43 - and so it was in this really weird
04:46 - mental space that i was in
04:47 - that i just could not get out of and i
04:50 - remember that
04:51 - last year in august one of the worst
04:54 - months of my life where
04:56 - no matter what i would do no matter
04:57 - where i would go my mind went with me
05:00 - every single place
05:01 - and i was trapped inside of it and i
05:03 - couldn't get out of it
05:05 - what i experienced was a really really
05:07 - painful experience
05:09 - it made me begin to get empathy for
05:11 - other people
05:12 - who maybe are suffering from depression
05:14 - maybe who are suffering from
05:16 - mental health disorders who who are like
05:19 - are bipolar
05:20 - who go into states of mind that are
05:22 - completely irrational
05:24 - who suffer from anxiety who know that
05:26 - it's not true what's happening but they
05:28 - just can't help and get out of it
05:29 - they can't just think positively and all
05:31 - of a sudden like things change for them
05:34 - and so when that kind of set in i'm like
05:37 - oh my god this is hell like this is
05:39 - actually hell there's nothing worse than
05:41 - this i'd rather have some kind of
05:42 - physical problem
05:43 - rather than a mental problem because i
05:45 - can't run away from this
05:46 - i don't want to do anything um
05:50 - luckily for me when i actually got i i
05:54 - went to a little retreat
05:55 - i took three days off saturday and
05:58 - sunday
06:00 - friday so i took it's like three days
06:03 - off because normally you know i'll work
06:04 - seven days a week
06:05 - so i took those three days off took the
06:07 - weekend off and i went with my
06:09 - girlfriend and we went to like big bear
06:11 - and we just got a cabin in the woods and
06:13 - uh
06:14 - just kind of disconnected from
06:16 - everything and anything
06:18 - turned off my phone uh told my team hey
06:21 - just please help me i remember getting
06:22 - on a call with rachel i remember
06:24 - handing tasks off to rachel and i did i
06:27 - all i remember was i was on the call and
06:28 - that was the first time i actually
06:30 - was openly vulnerable with a team member
06:34 - because i thought you have to be strong
06:35 - and you have to
06:36 - not show weakness to your team
06:40 - and on that call i remember
06:43 - asking for i'm like i don't know what's
06:46 - wrong with me i'm like
06:48 - i think i just need help i said it i
06:50 - started crying
06:52 - rachel listened to it and rachel is like
06:54 - you know what i think she was pregnant
06:55 - at that time and she still didn't have a
06:58 - uh hallie yet and she was and she just
07:01 - like
07:02 - she's british and she's like so
07:03 - professional and she's so kind
07:05 - all the time and she's she has an
07:06 - amazing heart but i remember that day
07:08 - she was like on the facetime with me and
07:10 - she goes you know what
07:11 - she's in uk and she goes [ __ ] that she's
07:14 - like i'm gonna help you
07:15 - and she's like i'm gonna take care of
07:16 - everything you don't worry about
07:18 - anything
07:19 - i was like wow this is so unbelievable
07:22 - like this is the team
07:23 - these are the people and this means
07:25 - everything so i took those two days off
07:29 - that completely changed everything for
07:31 - me like i got completely re-centered
07:33 - realigned
07:34 - everything left my body and out of my
07:36 - body and i came back
07:38 - a different man and i still remember to
07:42 - this day that those three days
07:44 - like put us on a completely different
07:46 - trajectory you know like
07:48 - everything was going down that at that
07:50 - time
07:51 - everything felt like it was going down
07:52 - at least
07:54 - nothing was working or nothing made me
07:56 - feel happy and that turned it around
07:58 - completely and after that like we just
08:00 - had a
08:00 - you know there were lots of still ups
08:02 - and downs but the trajectory overall was
08:04 - upwards
08:05 - and i've been feeling very very happy
08:07 - since then
08:09 - but still today i just thought because
08:12 - today
08:12 - we took another a few days off to kind
08:15 - but instead of a few days off we
08:16 - actually took a vacation
08:18 - but it's like a workation we took we got
08:20 - airbnb so that's where we are right now
08:22 - the team is here daniel is right there
08:25 - uh nas is right there
08:27 - so the team is here and we're hunkering
08:29 - down to shoot
08:30 - content we're making content for profit
08:32 - with javascript there's like amazing
08:34 - react content that
08:35 - you know we [ __ ] up on we didn't
08:37 - deliver on time
08:38 - so now we're just like owning up to it
08:40 - we apologize to you if you're a profit
08:42 - javascript customer that's not right for
08:44 - you but we're owning up to our mistake
08:46 - and we're just gonna commit to it and
08:48 - we're gonna put in the work doesn't
08:49 - matter what it takes
08:50 - we're just gonna do it we're gonna
08:52 - deliver it for you guys is gonna be
08:54 - the best piece of content on react that
08:56 - you guys have seen to date
08:58 - and we're gonna over deliver on that
09:01 - so that's what we're doing right but
09:03 - we're just focusing and working
09:05 - still just a change of scenery and the
09:08 - change of
09:09 - regular environment allowed us
09:12 - and allowed me to de-stress in a way
09:14 - that i hadn't
09:15 - in a long time and just being here
09:19 - like think about this right it's 9 23
09:21 - p.m
09:22 - we had so much travel and we already put
09:26 - in
09:26 - a whole day's work and we got here and
09:29 - now
09:30 - i just want to work more like i just
09:32 - have a lot more energy
09:33 - simply because change of scenery
09:36 - change of location environment is
09:38 - different and i'm feeling excited i feel
09:41 - like i have a purpose
09:42 - so these little hacks right they add up
09:45 - you can actually use them if you know
09:49 - that these things work for you
09:50 - you can use them to get yourself out of
09:52 - those places
09:53 - and maybe put yourself in a better
09:55 - mental
09:56 - head space where you can feel happier or
09:58 - you can feel more energized
10:00 - or you can feel more excited or you can
10:02 - feel more elated and just
10:04 - out of that little mud that you were
10:06 - stuck in right it's kind of like a car
10:08 - being stuck in the mud
10:09 - and just can't get out so you can't just
10:12 - keep
10:12 - revving all day you need to do something
10:14 - else you might need to call somebody
10:17 - and have them help you push right aka
10:21 - asking friends or talking to people just
10:23 - even opening up and letting people know
10:25 - around you
10:26 - what you're verbally thinking and what
10:28 - is happening so the one part that i
10:29 - missed left out from that story
10:31 - the real thing that actually changed me
10:33 - in those three days yes
10:34 - distressing location but i was with my
10:37 - girlfriend and i was just like
10:38 - completely open and shared everything
10:40 - and everything that made me feel
10:41 - vulnerable i was like
10:42 - i'm scared about the business dying i'm
10:44 - scared about us not actually having the
10:45 - finances to continue next month
10:47 - i'm deathly scared of having to let any
10:50 - of my team members go
10:51 - that's my biggest fear in life like
10:53 - literally i have that's my like biggest
10:55 - fear above
10:56 - almost anything else um i i tell them
10:58 - and i don't joke about this i'm like if
11:00 - worse comes to worst i will literally go
11:02 - to a mall
11:02 - and dance naked and make a couple of
11:05 - dollars i don't know if that's gonna do
11:06 - it
11:07 - but i will do it just as a gesture or
11:09 - just for fun
11:10 - maybe just because i wanted to do it
11:13 - that is
11:14 - it's that important to me right so i
11:16 - told her like i'm afraid of that i'm
11:18 - afraid of that like frankie and aaron
11:20 - have like
11:20 - put in so much blood work and sweat
11:23 - into building this up with me i can't
11:26 - let them down like i have to actually
11:28 - live up to this and so
11:31 - when i shared all of those fears that
11:34 - were like hidden deep down
11:35 - and were causing so much pain for me
11:39 - it in a really weird way like first it
11:42 - made me feel
11:42 - weak and vulnerable because that's how
11:44 - as males were
11:46 - were brought up or maybe just people in
11:47 - general right not maybe just males but
11:49 - like you could be a female and have that
11:50 - type of
11:51 - like uh upbringing and feel that way
11:54 - so you know i'm like maybe
11:57 - so that made me feel vulnerable and in a
11:59 - weird way it made me feel weak like why
12:01 - am i sharing all these secrets with her
12:03 - and then i started getting on calls with
12:05 - every but in a weird way
12:07 - i kind of felt this like weird sense of
12:09 - relief
12:10 - i felt a little lighter and so i'm like
12:13 - okay if that works why don't i just keep
12:16 - because nothing else was working
12:18 - so i'm like why don't you just keep
12:19 - repeating that so then i called up like
12:21 - frankie and i just told him everything
12:24 - and he was like
12:25 - wow bro like i appreciate you saying
12:26 - that like wow
12:28 - and once i shared all these things with
12:30 - him and how i was even afraid that i
12:32 - might
12:33 - lose him on the team i remember he
12:35 - looked at me
12:36 - i mean oh it was over the phone there
12:38 - but there was another conversation we
12:40 - had too and frankie's recording this
12:41 - right now
12:42 - we had another conversation too we're
12:43 - just sitting down at bourgeois pig but
12:45 - like i'll get to that later
12:46 - but he told me on the call and he was
12:48 - like
12:50 - dude if something happens literally
12:53 - we'll work together for free to bring
12:55 - this back up
12:56 - like i don't care like it's bigger than
12:58 - just paying
13:00 - it's actually family
13:04 - um that was one of those moments that
13:08 - like
13:10 - like you know even right now like it has
13:13 - it has an impact on me and it like gets
13:14 - me emotional
13:15 - and so when i felt that i'm like
13:18 - [ __ ] this i'm getting out of this shitty
13:22 - ass mindset
13:23 - i'm gonna put myself to work and
13:26 - get out of this and actually get back to
13:29 - it another
13:30 - brilliant thing he told me is he said
13:32 - look
13:33 - i don't know there's a lot of things
13:35 - going on just know that we're here no
13:37 - matter what happens and that like
13:38 - grounded me like a [ __ ]
13:41 - the second thing he said is he said look
13:42 - what's another thing that helps you
13:45 - get back on track he's like one thing
13:47 - i've noticed is
13:48 - you when you help people that puts you
13:51 - back because it gets you out of your own
13:53 - [ __ ]
13:53 - and i was like sitting there and i'm
13:55 - like yeah that makes sense and he told
13:57 - me hey why don't you go help your
13:58 - brother
13:59 - and maybe just help him with his like
14:01 - product launch and like help him launch
14:03 - his youtube channel or something
14:04 - and i said okay i'm just gonna do that
14:07 - and he's like how would that make you
14:08 - feel and
14:09 - immediately before i even did that i'm
14:10 - like oh my god like if i have to rise to
14:13 - the occasion for my brother and help him
14:14 - build something i'm gonna show up like a
14:16 - champion i don't care what's been
14:18 - happening before
14:19 - if i have to rise up for frankie and
14:21 - he's willing to rise up for me i'm like
14:23 - i gotta do this if my team is willing to
14:25 - support me
14:26 - everybody around me is gonna support me
14:28 - i'm getting the [ __ ] up and i'm getting
14:30 - out and i'm just putting in the work
14:31 - that pushed me
14:33 - and got me out of that mindset and at
14:35 - that point the main thing that i had to
14:36 - focus on and do was
14:38 - now just work like now you have the
14:41 - momentum
14:41 - shut down the thinking because the
14:43 - thinking is going to keep thinking about
14:44 - the past which is going to make you
14:45 - depressed right i learned this from the
14:47 - book
14:48 - power of now by eckhart tolle and also
14:50 - my friend daniel said this too you start
14:51 - thinking about the past that's going to
14:52 - get you depressed
14:53 - you start thinking too much about the
14:54 - future that gives you anxiety but if i
14:56 - can just now use that momentum
14:58 - and work and shut off my thinking now
15:00 - i'm in a place of bliss and you know
15:01 - what i'm talking about like imagine
15:02 - you're coding for a really long time
15:04 - you're two three four five hours in you
15:06 - hit that flow state
15:07 - or you're editing a video you hit that
15:09 - flow state or you're just working on
15:11 - something
15:12 - which is two three four five hours in
15:14 - you hit that flow state and then time
15:16 - just kind of starts to fly and you kind
15:18 - of lose that sense of
15:20 - oh my god like you're in that flow state
15:22 - you stop caring for me
15:24 - that's what happened and i just started
15:25 - focusing on the work so that got me out
15:27 - of it for you
15:29 - what that means is look if you are
15:32 - feeling that there's
15:33 - things happening for you like you're
15:35 - dealing and you're just not in a place
15:37 - where you can think properly or
15:39 - there's too much negative self-talk or
15:41 - no matter how much action you take you
15:43 - feel like it's just
15:44 - not enough or it's not worth it there
15:47 - are 10 million other people doing the
15:48 - same thing every single day
15:50 - anyways why does it matter and that like
15:53 - lack of motivation and that negative
15:55 - self-talk is just constantly dragging
15:57 - you down
15:58 - what i want to tell you is one there are
16:01 - people there who care for you and there
16:02 - are people there who love you and
16:03 - support you
16:04 - go talk to them okay the real people who
16:06 - are supporting you not just the [ __ ]
16:08 - people
16:08 - that are trying to appease you so your
16:11 - closest circle of friends who are going
16:12 - to tell you the truth they're great
16:14 - people to actually like have a
16:15 - conversation with and
16:16 - let them know how you're feeling right
16:18 - so let i guess i just break down
16:20 - that down as point uh two so number two
16:22 - be
16:23 - very open and vulnerable okay so if
16:26 - there are
16:26 - thoughts that are like your darkest
16:28 - thoughts or they're freaking the [ __ ]
16:30 - out or you're scared that they're gonna
16:32 - judge you
16:33 - those are the things you need to share
16:34 - with the people around you the more you
16:36 - share and let that out
16:38 - that skeleton and that weird thing it's
16:41 - like poison
16:41 - it doesn't have time to grow it's kind
16:43 - of like you just get in there you take
16:44 - it out
16:45 - right as it's about to spread you just
16:47 - take it out if you wait too long
16:49 - it's just gonna like go through your
16:50 - whole body and now your
16:52 - the whole thing is messed up right so
16:55 - start
16:55 - sharing with people what you're thinking
16:57 - about and everything that's bothering
16:59 - you
16:59 - i mean obviously if you can go get a
17:02 - therapist
17:02 - go get a therapist like virtually and i
17:04 - really really mean it
17:06 - and there's nothing wrong with this or
17:07 - stigmatizing right like
17:09 - just do it because it's actually going
17:11 - to help you whether it's with
17:13 - you trying to get a job or you're trying
17:14 - to do something and
17:16 - even just your own work and productivity
17:18 - that might be one of those things
17:19 - because
17:19 - if i just gave you like some tips of
17:21 - productivity it's like putting a
17:23 - band-aid on this right if you
17:25 - have um if there's a deeper problem then
17:28 - i want to address that deeper problem so
17:31 - being vulnerable and honest really
17:33 - really helps because it takes away the
17:35 - power from all those things that are
17:36 - really frightening
17:37 - or scary to you once you say them out
17:39 - loud you're like
17:41 - that actually doesn't sound that bad
17:43 - okay maybe i can just get out of my own
17:45 - way
17:45 - you can listen to yourself or they can
17:47 - point out something that you weren't
17:48 - thinking about
17:49 - number three what i recommend is you can
17:52 - change your environment
17:53 - all right so like even right now we're
17:55 - at this airbnb
17:57 - we just got away from the other
17:58 - environment and i mean it was a great
18:00 - environment
18:00 - but like here we're like more inspired
18:04 - the freaking ceiling is so high and i
18:07 - love it it just makes me feel
18:09 - happy and spacious it makes me feel like
18:12 - i think
18:13 - all these windows i mean they're not
18:15 - that necessary i'm not going to be
18:16 - looking out of that [ __ ]
18:17 - top left triangle window but
18:20 - it's exciting to be in a space where i
18:24 - feel
18:24 - inspired rejuvenated and mentally
18:27 - relaxed so what that means for me is the
18:30 - roi of that is
18:31 - really really crazy because first of all
18:33 - it makes me really happy
18:34 - second of all now i'm making content now
18:36 - i'm
18:37 - de over delivering on the things that
18:39 - i've been meaning to do right and
18:41 - the things that i want to go harder on
18:43 - so that's the
18:44 - the third thing right change your
18:45 - environment number four what i can say
18:47 - is stop the thinking mind and get
18:50 - busy with the actual doing so often
18:53 - times when
18:54 - you are stuck with thinking that's the
18:57 - place that's like
18:58 - really really gets you [ __ ] up okay so
19:01 - please
19:02 - find something to do and just get to
19:04 - work and stop
19:05 - the thinking the more you think when
19:07 - you're in a negative state of mind
19:10 - the worse it just keeps getting it's a
19:11 - downward spiral and there's really like
19:13 - no
19:14 - um way to think your way out of it right
19:17 - it's kind of like if let's say you're
19:18 - really scared of heights
19:20 - well let's say you are now gonna bungee
19:23 - jump the longer you take and let me ask
19:25 - you the longer you take are you gonna
19:27 - get less scared or
19:28 - more scared before you jump that's the
19:30 - problem with negativity it's such a
19:31 - strong downward spiral the more
19:33 - time you sit down with it the worse it
19:36 - gets
19:37 - so the best things you can do actually
19:40 - require you to
19:41 - do which is action so start
19:44 - doing things whether it means like you
19:46 - know for example make three videos that
19:48 - day
19:48 - or code up actual projects that day so
19:52 - you're just caught up in the work
19:54 - i'll [ __ ] love chess i'll just start
19:56 - playing chess
19:57 - that gets me to think about chess i'm
19:59 - like caro khan french defense oh he's
20:01 - playing a sicilian
20:03 - right it gets me to focus and enjoy
20:06 - something or do
20:07 - something that makes that forces you to
20:09 - essentially be
20:11 - really really present right and that's
20:12 - in line with the stopping the thinking
20:14 - mind
20:15 - playing ping-pong gets you really
20:18 - focused you can't be like
20:19 - depressed and like be playing ping-pong
20:22 - with somebody because you're going to
20:23 - lose the point so you have to actually
20:24 - be focused
20:25 - so things that kind of almost in a way
20:28 - that that are designed in a way that
20:29 - almost force you to be
20:31 - present do those the more you can stop
20:33 - your thinking mind
20:34 - the better it's gonna be for you and
20:36 - number five
20:37 - be grateful so this is something that
20:40 - it's hard to just practice it but really
20:43 - start looking around at what you're
20:45 - missing
20:45 - that is positive or what you do have in
20:48 - life
20:49 - because i know maybe the dialogue in
20:51 - your life right now might be like
20:52 - there's a lot of things that you're
20:53 - missing or you're missing this or you
20:55 - could make more money
20:56 - or you don't have the nice job that you
20:58 - wanted or maybe
20:59 - you don't like the work that you do or
21:02 - you want to switch
21:03 - or you're just stuck in coding and you
21:05 - keep getting frustrated because you're
21:06 - stuck in these projects
21:07 - and you don't really see a way through
21:09 - whatever it is think about what are the
21:11 - actual positive
21:12 - things that are happening because what
21:13 - happens with us is you know and um these
21:15 - are things i'm like picking up from um
21:17 - owen cooks like personal development
21:20 - stuff so i'm gonna mention it here but
21:21 - there's something called the reticular
21:22 - activation
21:23 - activation system and so when that kind
21:26 - of flips for you
21:27 - it it makes everything like in invisible
21:30 - and you don't even see those things that
21:31 - are around you
21:32 - so i'll give you an example right
21:34 - sometimes if so my girlfriend
21:36 - if she is feeling like anxiety or
21:38 - feeling threatened
21:39 - and if she sees a comment let's say she
21:41 - made a post and they got
21:42 - a lot of people there right sometimes
21:44 - she'll look at it and she got
21:46 - 500 000 views on it right 700 000 views
21:48 - on it i'm like oh my god look at this
21:50 - like
21:50 - throughout their post we're getting 100
21:52 - this is 700 000 it's crazy
21:54 - but somebody made like a really nasty
21:56 - evil
21:57 - comment she can't really focus at that
21:59 - moment in the 700 000 views
22:00 - she can't really focus on the 6000
22:02 - shares or the 30
22:04 - 000 or 80 000 likes she can't even focus
22:07 - on the positive comments
22:08 - she's like why would this person say
22:10 - this you know like really hurt by it
22:12 - and that's a natural response it happens
22:14 - to me too where i'm like oh my god some
22:16 - so negative
22:17 - you know so and you know when she sees
22:19 - positive like when she's out of that
22:21 - state she then starts focusing on the
22:23 - positive
22:23 - but why i'm telling you this is the good
22:26 - things around you might actually be
22:27 - invisible to you right now like
22:29 - literally it's like oh yeah but that guy
22:30 - is my friend you know like that guy's my
22:32 - buddy so whatever but like
22:33 - this is the thing that sucks in my life
22:35 - no what like if you're gonna focus on
22:37 - that thing and say that thing sucks like
22:39 - for example
22:40 - if i am gonna say that i got that
22:42 - negative comment and i hate that comment
22:45 - i'm so negatively triggered by it well
22:47 - then i need to get
22:48 - actively positively triggered by the
22:51 - good comment right then that's actually
22:53 - fair i should be like
22:54 - yes whoa let's go hey
22:57 - high five everybody like what's up like
22:59 - we got a positive comment like let's go
23:02 - i need to be then positively triggered
23:05 - by that
23:06 - and then i go negatively triggered but
23:07 - how come all the oh yeah that's cool
23:09 - like that person
23:10 - said his gratitude or that person said
23:12 - oh my god learning this changed my life
23:14 - so i need to be triggered by both and be
23:16 - triggered by both so
23:17 - don't just ignore that one friend that
23:19 - you maybe you might be taking for
23:21 - granted
23:21 - right or the family member that you
23:23 - might be taking for granted or
23:25 - what you are doing that you might be
23:27 - taking for granted or maybe the fact
23:28 - that you even have
23:29 - a job or the fact that maybe you even
23:32 - have
23:33 - those like maybe even taking for granted
23:36 - the fact that you can even feel the pain
23:38 - and frustration of being stuck in
23:39 - something
23:40 - that's a beautiful thing because when
23:41 - you get out of it you can help other
23:43 - people get out of it
23:44 - and you can look back and you get that
23:45 - feeling of satisfaction
23:47 - once you get past something so being
23:49 - grateful that you're stuck
23:50 - because you know you're gonna feel that
23:52 - amazing thing afterwards
23:54 - so those are the five steps five
23:57 - things that i think can help you and uh
24:01 - that's it that's what i had on my mind i
24:03 - hope that it helps you or inspires you
24:06 - or gives you some ideas to maybe get out
24:07 - of that space
24:08 - hopefully maybe it inspires you to
24:10 - change your environment or maybe you're
24:12 - already starting to feel grateful
24:13 - and excited and maybe you're starting to
24:16 - look at things
24:16 - in a new way or maybe you're getting
24:18 - that glimmer of hope and maybe you're
24:19 - thinking of reaching out to that one
24:21 - friend
24:21 - to go hang out and actually play ping
24:23 - pong or just go go hang out and be
24:26 - happy or calm or maybe you're thinking
24:27 - about reaching out to somebody and
24:30 - sharing all the things that are holding
24:32 - you back or your fears
24:33 - all right so what i want to do is
24:37 - i absolutely hate that if i just watch
24:40 - something and i don't take action on it
24:41 - like one of my things that i hate the
24:43 - most i also hate when other people do
24:45 - that so
24:46 - i want to love you i call this
24:48 - conditional love but only on one
24:50 - condition
24:50 - take action on this if you watch this
24:52 - video this spoke out to you
24:54 - something stood out to you what i want
24:56 - you to do is comment below
24:58 - on what one action step you're going to
25:01 - take as a result
25:02 - of this video and then i need you to
25:04 - actually take that action step
25:06 - otherwise the point there's no point to
25:08 - this video okay
25:10 - so what i want what i want you to do is
25:12 - comment below like what's the action
25:14 - step you're going to take maybe you're
25:15 - going to reach out to your friend and
25:16 - share everything that's like been
25:18 - holding you back like whatever that
25:19 - secret is
25:20 - that's [ __ ] hard i feel you but maybe
25:22 - you just have to do that
25:24 - maybe you're like hey i'm going to start
25:26 - doing this thing that i wasn't going to
25:27 - do

25:48 - or maybe you might have a friend you
25:50 - might think they're feeling this way but
25:51 - they're scared to bring it up
25:53 - so go and help them right maybe you're
25:56 - in a negative state or maybe you know
25:57 - somebody who might mean that state
25:59 - so they're scared to come out to you
26:02 - right don't
26:02 - wait for them to bring up the
26:03 - conversation and be scared of it being
26:05 - awkward
26:06 - but get them out of that hell their
26:08 - mental health trust me nobody wants to
26:10 - be there so go and talk to them
26:12 - or share this video with them or share

26:15 - this can help
26:16 - okay so do that for me take some type of
26:19 - action please i would love your
26:21 - beautiful face
26:21 - for it last few things guys we have
26:25 - we've opened up our program profitable
26:26 - shortcut which is our
26:29 - uh program where we help people become
26:31 - developers
26:32 - or go from being a developer to getting
26:35 - a six-figure or higher
26:36 - job it's our high level program where we
26:39 - really like work closely with you
26:41 - i work really closely with you my entire
26:44 - team works really closely with you
26:45 - nas works closely with you so this has
26:47 - been a thing that's been on top of my
26:49 - mind on top of my team's mind that's why
26:50 - we even made this program profitable
26:52 - shortcuts so
26:53 - we can have developers in there so not
26:55 - only do we work with them like very
26:57 - closely
26:57 - we want to work with them to actually
26:59 - also make sure they're happy
27:01 - i remember actually calling out devon on
27:03 - one of the coaching calls
27:04 - on not being happy actually remember
27:06 - that um i'm too lazy to put in that clip
27:09 - but that was like really awesome and i
27:11 - remember that
27:12 - we worked on it and he actually started
27:14 - becoming happier over time because he
27:15 - realized that was his blind spot
27:17 - and so sometimes you might not realize
27:19 - that so we wanted to give you that
27:21 - community of people around you where you
27:23 - can share all these things because
27:25 - we know this and we give the space
27:29 - for you we have the space for you so you
27:30 - can share all these things
27:33 - we as the coaches can see those signs
27:36 - maybe they're in a blind spot for you
27:38 - but if you're in that spot maybe we can
27:39 - call it out or make it
27:41 - come into your awareness because even
27:43 - just it being you being aware of it
27:46 - helps you actually solve the problem at
27:48 - a big
27:49 - state and like when you're not happy the
27:51 - cost of being unhappy
27:53 - even if you want to get like you know
27:55 - what's the roi and all of that
27:57 - the cost of being unhappy is actually
27:59 - really really high like
28:01 - all those things that you don't do like
28:03 - if you're at your happiest what could
28:05 - you achieve
28:06 - if you're not at your happiest or you're
28:08 - unhappy
28:09 - what's the delta there that's what
28:11 - you're actually losing
28:13 - right so we want to make sure that that
28:15 - doesn't happen you stay
28:16 - happy and you keep getting success in
28:19 - your career so

Cleaned transcript:

what's up boys and girls this is qazi from clever programmer i hope you're excited we're about to start dropping a bunch of content and um i want to talk about something important today which is mental health for developers this has been something that's on my mind for a while it's mental health in general but i want to speak specifically to you guys so you guys can relate to it as well um before we get into this video just do me a favor smash that like button so this video goes out to more people and so we can help more people and more developers in general and with that said let's get right into it mental health is one of those things that is extremely important but often times not talked about enough or oftentimes very stigmatized so when people are suffering with things that are in their head they don't actually know how to deal with it and they also don't know where to go and ask for help and especially if you're in a male dominant dominated community like development or your friends are all males around you and i don't necessarily think just males are like this but generally they're a little bit more insensitive and they your friends won't you know care they'll be like haha like just toughen up you're just being a little [ __ ] and you're like no actually there are things that actually need space and i need time to come out and think about things and get into a different mental state it's one of those things that if your head is not in the right place like for example i'll tell you right like last year in 2019 i'm the type of person that's always happy always smiling always grateful doesn't matter what has happened to me right even when i was young and i went to a religious school between the ages of 9 and 12 years old and i was beat every single day um the school was between 8 am to 10 pm so it was 12 to 14 hours long often times and if i got beat up really bad and i had bruises and i went home and the teachers would beat you up there and if i told my parents i would come back and i would get beaten up even more so it was better to just not tell anybody and i had to go to that for three to four years and so there are a lot of things that happen to me but i feel like maybe i got lucky in the process or whatever happened but my normal became yo if i wake up and i'm not getting beat my like the [ __ ] beat out of me it's a good day i'm happy let's go let's work let's come up with something i see the world as like a playground and i just see that there's so much opportunity and possibilities and if you imagine a cake right there's a giant cake i imagine that the world is not just one giant cake where if you keep taking out the cake runs out i imagine there are like infinite cakes that are out there and i and i imagine that the world shows you how to make as many cakes as you want so there's enough for every single person right if you become successful doesn't mean i can't become successful if i become successful doesn't mean you can't become successful so sometimes people think somebody's success will hurt or hinder theirs and that's also not true so for me to come you know spend that much time and be grateful and i always feel like i'm always happy and in a good state of mind but last year i was in a state of mind where i remember waking up and not wanting to get out of bed i remember i would try to stay in bed as long as i possibly could and i remember that when i would get out i would sit there and think like why am i feeling sad why am i not feeling happy why do i feel like literally like [ __ ] like i don't want to do anything and i remember this is there's just one thing that i would always do to get out of pretty much any state there are a lot of things that i like to do like i love to play table tennis i love to play chess i love to play pool snooker bowling uh soccer you know there's like bunch of things coding like there's a bunch of stuff that i like to do if i sit there and i i normally go through them and i'm like okay you know what even though i don't feel like working today even though i don't feel like doing all these other things today i feel like playing ping pong or i feel like bowling and that centers me and i go okay i can still be happy okay cool let me just go do that and when i do that i come back i'm happy and i'm a completely different state of mind that day what happened was i looked at myself and i remember going through the list of every single thing and there was not a single thing that made me happy or that made me feel okay i looked in the mirror and i kept looking at myself and i remember my face kind of just started getting distorted and i started materials started streaming down and i couldn't control them i just started crying and i kept i actually just kept verbally asking like what is wrong with me why do i feel like this why do i feel unhappy and i just kept and i felt like i was broken and so it was in this really weird mental space that i was in that i just could not get out of and i remember that last year in august one of the worst months of my life where no matter what i would do no matter where i would go my mind went with me every single place and i was trapped inside of it and i couldn't get out of it what i experienced was a really really painful experience it made me begin to get empathy for other people who maybe are suffering from depression maybe who are suffering from mental health disorders who who are like are bipolar who go into states of mind that are completely irrational who suffer from anxiety who know that it's not true what's happening but they just can't help and get out of it they can't just think positively and all of a sudden like things change for them and so when that kind of set in i'm like oh my god this is hell like this is actually hell there's nothing worse than this i'd rather have some kind of physical problem rather than a mental problem because i can't run away from this i don't want to do anything um luckily for me when i actually got i i went to a little retreat i took three days off saturday and sunday friday so i took it's like three days off because normally you know i'll work seven days a week so i took those three days off took the weekend off and i went with my girlfriend and we went to like big bear and we just got a cabin in the woods and uh just kind of disconnected from everything and anything turned off my phone uh told my team hey just please help me i remember getting on a call with rachel i remember handing tasks off to rachel and i did i all i remember was i was on the call and that was the first time i actually was openly vulnerable with a team member because i thought you have to be strong and you have to not show weakness to your team and on that call i remember asking for i'm like i don't know what's wrong with me i'm like i think i just need help i said it i started crying rachel listened to it and rachel is like you know what i think she was pregnant at that time and she still didn't have a uh hallie yet and she was and she just like she's british and she's like so professional and she's so kind all the time and she's she has an amazing heart but i remember that day she was like on the facetime with me and she goes you know what she's in uk and she goes [ __ ] that she's like i'm gonna help you and she's like i'm gonna take care of everything you don't worry about anything i was like wow this is so unbelievable like this is the team these are the people and this means everything so i took those two days off that completely changed everything for me like i got completely recentered realigned everything left my body and out of my body and i came back a different man and i still remember to this day that those three days like put us on a completely different trajectory you know like everything was going down that at that time everything felt like it was going down at least nothing was working or nothing made me feel happy and that turned it around completely and after that like we just had a you know there were lots of still ups and downs but the trajectory overall was upwards and i've been feeling very very happy since then but still today i just thought because today we took another a few days off to kind but instead of a few days off we actually took a vacation but it's like a workation we took we got airbnb so that's where we are right now the team is here daniel is right there uh nas is right there so the team is here and we're hunkering down to shoot content we're making content for profit with javascript there's like amazing react content that you know we [ __ ] up on we didn't deliver on time so now we're just like owning up to it we apologize to you if you're a profit javascript customer that's not right for you but we're owning up to our mistake and we're just gonna commit to it and we're gonna put in the work doesn't matter what it takes we're just gonna do it we're gonna deliver it for you guys is gonna be the best piece of content on react that you guys have seen to date and we're gonna over deliver on that so that's what we're doing right but we're just focusing and working still just a change of scenery and the change of regular environment allowed us and allowed me to destress in a way that i hadn't in a long time and just being here like think about this right it's 9 23 p.m we had so much travel and we already put in a whole day's work and we got here and now i just want to work more like i just have a lot more energy simply because change of scenery change of location environment is different and i'm feeling excited i feel like i have a purpose so these little hacks right they add up you can actually use them if you know that these things work for you you can use them to get yourself out of those places and maybe put yourself in a better mental head space where you can feel happier or you can feel more energized or you can feel more excited or you can feel more elated and just out of that little mud that you were stuck in right it's kind of like a car being stuck in the mud and just can't get out so you can't just keep revving all day you need to do something else you might need to call somebody and have them help you push right aka asking friends or talking to people just even opening up and letting people know around you what you're verbally thinking and what is happening so the one part that i missed left out from that story the real thing that actually changed me in those three days yes distressing location but i was with my girlfriend and i was just like completely open and shared everything and everything that made me feel vulnerable i was like i'm scared about the business dying i'm scared about us not actually having the finances to continue next month i'm deathly scared of having to let any of my team members go that's my biggest fear in life like literally i have that's my like biggest fear above almost anything else um i i tell them and i don't joke about this i'm like if worse comes to worst i will literally go to a mall and dance naked and make a couple of dollars i don't know if that's gonna do it but i will do it just as a gesture or just for fun maybe just because i wanted to do it that is it's that important to me right so i told her like i'm afraid of that i'm afraid of that like frankie and aaron have like put in so much blood work and sweat into building this up with me i can't let them down like i have to actually live up to this and so when i shared all of those fears that were like hidden deep down and were causing so much pain for me it in a really weird way like first it made me feel weak and vulnerable because that's how as males were were brought up or maybe just people in general right not maybe just males but like you could be a female and have that type of like uh upbringing and feel that way so you know i'm like maybe so that made me feel vulnerable and in a weird way it made me feel weak like why am i sharing all these secrets with her and then i started getting on calls with every but in a weird way i kind of felt this like weird sense of relief i felt a little lighter and so i'm like okay if that works why don't i just keep because nothing else was working so i'm like why don't you just keep repeating that so then i called up like frankie and i just told him everything and he was like wow bro like i appreciate you saying that like wow and once i shared all these things with him and how i was even afraid that i might lose him on the team i remember he looked at me i mean oh it was over the phone there but there was another conversation we had too and frankie's recording this right now we had another conversation too we're just sitting down at bourgeois pig but like i'll get to that later but he told me on the call and he was like dude if something happens literally we'll work together for free to bring this back up like i don't care like it's bigger than just paying it's actually family um that was one of those moments that like like you know even right now like it has it has an impact on me and it like gets me emotional and so when i felt that i'm like [ __ ] this i'm getting out of this shitty ass mindset i'm gonna put myself to work and get out of this and actually get back to it another brilliant thing he told me is he said look i don't know there's a lot of things going on just know that we're here no matter what happens and that like grounded me like a [ __ ] the second thing he said is he said look what's another thing that helps you get back on track he's like one thing i've noticed is you when you help people that puts you back because it gets you out of your own [ __ ] and i was like sitting there and i'm like yeah that makes sense and he told me hey why don't you go help your brother and maybe just help him with his like product launch and like help him launch his youtube channel or something and i said okay i'm just gonna do that and he's like how would that make you feel and immediately before i even did that i'm like oh my god like if i have to rise to the occasion for my brother and help him build something i'm gonna show up like a champion i don't care what's been happening before if i have to rise up for frankie and he's willing to rise up for me i'm like i gotta do this if my team is willing to support me everybody around me is gonna support me i'm getting the [ __ ] up and i'm getting out and i'm just putting in the work that pushed me and got me out of that mindset and at that point the main thing that i had to focus on and do was now just work like now you have the momentum shut down the thinking because the thinking is going to keep thinking about the past which is going to make you depressed right i learned this from the book power of now by eckhart tolle and also my friend daniel said this too you start thinking about the past that's going to get you depressed you start thinking too much about the future that gives you anxiety but if i can just now use that momentum and work and shut off my thinking now i'm in a place of bliss and you know what i'm talking about like imagine you're coding for a really long time you're two three four five hours in you hit that flow state or you're editing a video you hit that flow state or you're just working on something which is two three four five hours in you hit that flow state and then time just kind of starts to fly and you kind of lose that sense of oh my god like you're in that flow state you stop caring for me that's what happened and i just started focusing on the work so that got me out of it for you what that means is look if you are feeling that there's things happening for you like you're dealing and you're just not in a place where you can think properly or there's too much negative selftalk or no matter how much action you take you feel like it's just not enough or it's not worth it there are 10 million other people doing the same thing every single day anyways why does it matter and that like lack of motivation and that negative selftalk is just constantly dragging you down what i want to tell you is one there are people there who care for you and there are people there who love you and support you go talk to them okay the real people who are supporting you not just the [ __ ] people that are trying to appease you so your closest circle of friends who are going to tell you the truth they're great people to actually like have a conversation with and let them know how you're feeling right so let i guess i just break down that down as point uh two so number two be very open and vulnerable okay so if there are thoughts that are like your darkest thoughts or they're freaking the [ __ ] out or you're scared that they're gonna judge you those are the things you need to share with the people around you the more you share and let that out that skeleton and that weird thing it's like poison it doesn't have time to grow it's kind of like you just get in there you take it out right as it's about to spread you just take it out if you wait too long it's just gonna like go through your whole body and now your the whole thing is messed up right so start sharing with people what you're thinking about and everything that's bothering you i mean obviously if you can go get a therapist go get a therapist like virtually and i really really mean it and there's nothing wrong with this or stigmatizing right like just do it because it's actually going to help you whether it's with you trying to get a job or you're trying to do something and even just your own work and productivity that might be one of those things because if i just gave you like some tips of productivity it's like putting a bandaid on this right if you have um if there's a deeper problem then i want to address that deeper problem so being vulnerable and honest really really helps because it takes away the power from all those things that are really frightening or scary to you once you say them out loud you're like that actually doesn't sound that bad okay maybe i can just get out of my own way you can listen to yourself or they can point out something that you weren't thinking about number three what i recommend is you can change your environment all right so like even right now we're at this airbnb we just got away from the other environment and i mean it was a great environment but like here we're like more inspired the freaking ceiling is so high and i love it it just makes me feel happy and spacious it makes me feel like i think all these windows i mean they're not that necessary i'm not going to be looking out of that [ __ ] top left triangle window but it's exciting to be in a space where i feel inspired rejuvenated and mentally relaxed so what that means for me is the roi of that is really really crazy because first of all it makes me really happy second of all now i'm making content now i'm de over delivering on the things that i've been meaning to do right and the things that i want to go harder on so that's the the third thing right change your environment number four what i can say is stop the thinking mind and get busy with the actual doing so often times when you are stuck with thinking that's the place that's like really really gets you [ __ ] up okay so please find something to do and just get to work and stop the thinking the more you think when you're in a negative state of mind the worse it just keeps getting it's a downward spiral and there's really like no um way to think your way out of it right it's kind of like if let's say you're really scared of heights well let's say you are now gonna bungee jump the longer you take and let me ask you the longer you take are you gonna get less scared or more scared before you jump that's the problem with negativity it's such a strong downward spiral the more time you sit down with it the worse it gets so the best things you can do actually require you to do which is action so start doing things whether it means like you know for example make three videos that day or code up actual projects that day so you're just caught up in the work i'll [ __ ] love chess i'll just start playing chess that gets me to think about chess i'm like caro khan french defense oh he's playing a sicilian right it gets me to focus and enjoy something or do something that makes that forces you to essentially be really really present right and that's in line with the stopping the thinking mind playing pingpong gets you really focused you can't be like depressed and like be playing pingpong with somebody because you're going to lose the point so you have to actually be focused so things that kind of almost in a way that that are designed in a way that almost force you to be present do those the more you can stop your thinking mind the better it's gonna be for you and number five be grateful so this is something that it's hard to just practice it but really start looking around at what you're missing that is positive or what you do have in life because i know maybe the dialogue in your life right now might be like there's a lot of things that you're missing or you're missing this or you could make more money or you don't have the nice job that you wanted or maybe you don't like the work that you do or you want to switch or you're just stuck in coding and you keep getting frustrated because you're stuck in these projects and you don't really see a way through whatever it is think about what are the actual positive things that are happening because what happens with us is you know and um these are things i'm like picking up from um owen cooks like personal development stuff so i'm gonna mention it here but there's something called the reticular activation activation system and so when that kind of flips for you it it makes everything like in invisible and you don't even see those things that are around you so i'll give you an example right sometimes if so my girlfriend if she is feeling like anxiety or feeling threatened and if she sees a comment let's say she made a post and they got a lot of people there right sometimes she'll look at it and she got 500 000 views on it right 700 000 views on it i'm like oh my god look at this like throughout their post we're getting 100 this is 700 000 it's crazy but somebody made like a really nasty evil comment she can't really focus at that moment in the 700 000 views she can't really focus on the 6000 shares or the 30 000 or 80 000 likes she can't even focus on the positive comments she's like why would this person say this you know like really hurt by it and that's a natural response it happens to me too where i'm like oh my god some so negative you know so and you know when she sees positive like when she's out of that state she then starts focusing on the positive but why i'm telling you this is the good things around you might actually be invisible to you right now like literally it's like oh yeah but that guy is my friend you know like that guy's my buddy so whatever but like this is the thing that sucks in my life no what like if you're gonna focus on that thing and say that thing sucks like for example if i am gonna say that i got that negative comment and i hate that comment i'm so negatively triggered by it well then i need to get actively positively triggered by the good comment right then that's actually fair i should be like yes whoa let's go hey high five everybody like what's up like we got a positive comment like let's go i need to be then positively triggered by that and then i go negatively triggered but how come all the oh yeah that's cool like that person said his gratitude or that person said oh my god learning this changed my life so i need to be triggered by both and be triggered by both so don't just ignore that one friend that you maybe you might be taking for granted right or the family member that you might be taking for granted or what you are doing that you might be taking for granted or maybe the fact that you even have a job or the fact that maybe you even have those like maybe even taking for granted the fact that you can even feel the pain and frustration of being stuck in something that's a beautiful thing because when you get out of it you can help other people get out of it and you can look back and you get that feeling of satisfaction once you get past something so being grateful that you're stuck because you know you're gonna feel that amazing thing afterwards so those are the five steps five things that i think can help you and uh that's it that's what i had on my mind i hope that it helps you or inspires you or gives you some ideas to maybe get out of that space hopefully maybe it inspires you to change your environment or maybe you're already starting to feel grateful and excited and maybe you're starting to look at things in a new way or maybe you're getting that glimmer of hope and maybe you're thinking of reaching out to that one friend to go hang out and actually play ping pong or just go go hang out and be happy or calm or maybe you're thinking about reaching out to somebody and sharing all the things that are holding you back or your fears all right so what i want to do is i absolutely hate that if i just watch something and i don't take action on it like one of my things that i hate the most i also hate when other people do that so i want to love you i call this conditional love but only on one condition take action on this if you watch this video this spoke out to you something stood out to you what i want you to do is comment below on what one action step you're going to take as a result of this video and then i need you to actually take that action step otherwise the point there's no point to this video okay so what i want what i want you to do is comment below like what's the action step you're going to take maybe you're going to reach out to your friend and share everything that's like been holding you back like whatever that secret is that's [ __ ] hard i feel you but maybe you just have to do that maybe you're like hey i'm going to start doing this thing that i wasn't going to do so comment that below or maybe you're like i'm going to change my environment i'm just going to book a ticket and go somewhere else right go from this place to this place or maybe i'm just going to book an airbnb and do it so comment that below because that is exciting if you want you can tag me at cleverkazy on instagram and send me your story and maybe it caused you to do something that'd be so cool i'll reply back to you or maybe you might have a friend you might think they're feeling this way but they're scared to bring it up so go and help them right maybe you're in a negative state or maybe you know somebody who might mean that state so they're scared to come out to you right don't wait for them to bring up the conversation and be scared of it being awkward but get them out of that hell their mental health trust me nobody wants to be there so go and talk to them or share this video with them or share this video with somebody who you think this can help okay so do that for me take some type of action please i would love your beautiful face for it last few things guys we have we've opened up our program profitable shortcut which is our uh program where we help people

can have developers in there so not only do we work with them like very closely we want to work with them to actually also make sure they're happy i remember actually calling out devon on one of the coaching calls on not being happy actually remember that um i'm too lazy to put in that clip but that was like really awesome and i remember that we worked on it and he actually started becoming happier over time because he realized that was his blind spot and so sometimes you might not realize that so we wanted to give you that community of people around you where you can share all these things because we know this and we give the space for you we have the space for you so you can share all these things we as the coaches can see those signs maybe they're in a blind spot for you but if you're in that spot maybe we can call it out or make it come into your awareness because even just it being you being aware of it helps you actually solve the problem at a big state and like when you're not happy the cost of being unhappy even if you want to get like you know what's the roi and all of that the cost of being unhappy is actually really really high like all those things that you don't do like if you're at your happiest what could you achieve if you're not at your happiest or you're unhappy what's the delta there that's what you're actually losing right so we want to make sure
