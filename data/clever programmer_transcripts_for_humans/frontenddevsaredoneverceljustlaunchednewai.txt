00:00 - frontend devs are done or so I've heard
00:05 - with versel v0 coming out I've been so
00:08 - excited to check it out all day but I
00:10 - purposely decided not to so I could
00:13 - react live with you in real time so
00:16 - let's go ahead and check out versel v0
00:20 - which is apparently generative UI
00:21 - meaning you go to versel type in stuff
00:23 - it creates front end for you so let's
00:25 - see what the heck this is
00:27 - about all right so generating UI
00:30 - announcing v0 a few weeks ago we
00:33 - introduced it a product makes website
00:36 - creation as simple as describing your
00:37 - ideas we call it generative UI combining
00:40 - the best practices of front end
00:42 - development with the potential of
00:44 - generative AI the interest in V has been
00:47 - incredible with 100,000 people
00:49 - registering for the weight list in just
00:50 - 3 weeks today we're transitioning from
00:53 - alpha to
00:54 - Beta
00:56 - okay our goal is help developers B build
01:00 - the first iteration of their product
01:01 - like Ingo who built the first version of
01:03 - the Resume Builder product of the vzer
01:05 - or Brain Trust a new platform that built
01:07 - its pricing page using vzer Okay so
01:09 - let's take a look somebody built their
01:11 - pricing page all
01:14 - right okay so this was apparently built
01:16 - with v0 interesting okay let's take a
01:20 - look at this Resume Builder this was
01:23 - also built with VZ okay great I mean
01:26 - this is a lot of stuff that it's doing
01:30 - okay is there a way I can use it can I
01:35 - use it get started oh here we go okay
01:39 - v.d so if you go to v.d you can use it
01:42 - as
01:44 - well
01:45 - uh okay an eCommerce store for software
01:52 - developer
01:56 - merch okay let's see I got to
01:58 - authenticate so let's go go ahead and do
02:00 - that continue with GitHub sure oh man I
02:04 - hate this authentication I'll need to
02:07 - get my oh looks like it worked okay use
02:11 - generative AI to create copy and paste
02:13 - friendly react code based on Shad CDN UI
02:16 - and Tailwind okay great all right so how
02:19 - is this different than Chad GPT so far
02:21 - I'm
02:22 - confused oh mine was dark mode cuz I had
02:24 - my dark mode plugin enabled it's called
02:26 - Dark reader when you submit a prompt or
02:30 - up or an upload an image VZ will use AI
02:33 - to generate three different uis
02:36 - okay a pricing section with a title and
02:39 - description okay nice you can select
02:41 - individual parts of a generated UI to
02:42 - refine your creation or edit the code
02:44 - directly once you're ready you can then
02:45 - copy paste it into your react app and
02:47 - ship make this longer blah blah blah
02:50 - okay welcome start generating let's go
02:55 - let's see what this is about all right
02:57 - so I'm going to hit enter and let's see
03:00 - what happens I'm excited
03:03 - boys and girl probably the one girl that
03:06 - watches this channel if you're a girl
03:08 - comment below we we need some more
03:10 - ladies up in here this is too much too
03:12 - many boys on this
03:15 - channel all right so it's actually
03:17 - building it if you guys could see at the
03:19 - bottom I can see it's starting to build
03:23 - it interesting okay so it looks like
03:26 - it's building a
03:28 - a yeah is is it building three different
03:31 - versions did it say that and I'm just
03:33 - like tweaking right now or is one side
03:35 - building the Navar and then the other
03:37 - side is building something
03:38 - else wow this is great like when you
03:43 - code with Chad GPT you guys know how it
03:45 - makes it look like ass when you get the
03:48 - front end from there it looks so
03:49 - terrible and this front end looks
03:52 - amazing like this is usable front
03:56 - end that's amazing okay so it gave G me
04:00 - three options I guess so I I I like
04:03 - option A I like having this sidebar and
04:05 - then being able to do this okay what
04:08 - else can we do here so I'm going to say
04:10 - um call The Shop
04:14 - clever
04:17 - programmer programmer okay and then on
04:20 - the leftand
04:23 - side on the left hand side add a donate
04:29 - button
04:34 - okay um and for join now
04:38 - button
04:40 - say let's see so this so basically here
04:43 - I wanted to add a donate button here I
04:46 - wanted to say clever programmer and here
04:48 - join now I wanted to actually say join
04:52 - today to save
04:54 - $100 um I don't even know if that'll fit
04:58 - there but we'll see I'm going to hit
05:00 - enter and let's just see what happens it
05:01 - might crash it might shut down it might
05:04 - do something
05:09 - awful but we'll
05:11 - see this is exciting you guys this is
05:16 - this is
05:17 - revolutionary uh I'm I'm so genuinely
05:19 - excited about this cuz I want to be
05:21 - coding I hate doing front end I want to
05:23 - do backend stuff it makes me feel like
05:25 - I'm enjoying my life instead of changing
05:27 - colors of buttons for hours or
05:29 - positioning ooh here we go so we got a
05:32 - button that says donate okay fantastic
05:34 - we got clever programmer and it figured
05:37 - out how to do it in a really smart way
05:38 - it goes join our membership join today
05:41 - to save $100 on exclusive discounts and
05:50 - perks guys give it up for
05:57 - v0 this is fantastic
06:00 - um okay let's uh oh wait I can get the
06:03 - code holy look at that I got full
06:08 - react code here and I bet I could paste
06:11 - it somewhere and it would work and I got
06:14 - the HTML okay so let's try this HTML and
06:17 - let's put it in code pen we'll start say
06:20 - we'll say start coding paste it
06:22 - here
06:24 - and yeah I mean of course it'll look
06:26 - like because we don't have styling
06:28 - right does does it do inline styling
06:30 - how's it doing
06:33 - styling oh yes because we don't have
06:36 - Tailwind uh it's using Tailwind styling
06:40 - how do you enable Tailwind here let's
06:42 - see
06:45 - Tailwind in code pen can we do Tailwind
06:48 - in code
06:50 - pen how to use tailwind and code
06:56 - pin Okay so
07:00 - somebody has a page that has Tailwind I
07:02 - guess
07:05 - somehow
07:07 - um that's what we need we just need the
07:10 - Tailwind CDN I think okay I don't use
07:14 - codepen a lot so if you're like oh you
07:16 - can just do it this way it's okay like
07:18 - relax I don't I don't use it all the
07:20 - time okay so that's why close there we
07:24 - go look at that we're getting the
07:28 - styling beautiful it doesn't look
07:31 - perfectly like the one we wanted but
07:33 - it's still there and I bet if we
07:35 - actually looked at the react version
07:37 - probably that's just up and running so
07:40 - if you go to repet you can just probably
07:42 - have it up and running or stack Blitz
07:43 - and have it up and running but
07:45 - nonetheless like the point is that it
07:48 - works right that's the point like look
07:50 - at this it's even responsive so if I
07:52 - actually go like
07:54 - this right you see that how it just
07:56 - turned responsive and it hit the nav bar
08:00 - right and now when I go here boom it
08:02 - brings it back like that is crazy cuz I
08:07 - again I just remember right like how bad
08:10 - Chad gpt's front end code was if you
08:12 - asked Chad GPT for this it would have
08:14 - give you something that you would want
08:16 - to vomit at if it if it gave you and
08:19 - this is so damn
08:22 - good this is very exciting good job
08:25 - versel whoever is behind this that's
08:28 - fantastic
08:29 - okay I can go back to the canvas now I
08:32 - can also do new generation if I'm done
08:34 - with this right so let's say we're done
08:35 - with our little ecommer store Vibes we
08:39 - can leave this and then to add
08:40 - functionality you could go back to Chad
08:43 - GPT o interesting so here's new
08:45 - generations a button with Border Great
08:47 - so if you need a button you could do
08:50 - that uh SAS results page
08:55 - interesting pricing is something very
08:57 - common so let's go pricing or
08:59 - testimonials are also really common so
09:02 - let's say give me a pricing page with
09:07 - three uh PR uh three tables one for
09:13 - starter second
09:15 - for pro and third for
09:19 - ultimate
09:21 - ultimate uh starter should be
09:25 - $300 Pro should be I don't know like
09:29 - let's say
09:31 - 1K uh and ultimate should be 3K okay so
09:36 - those are the three packages we have and
09:39 - then put in different things that should
09:43 - be included in there for example the
09:47 - $300
09:49 - one uh should just have a course and 1K
09:54 - should have group coaching and the 3K
09:59 - one should
10:01 - also include one on ones okay let's hit
10:05 - enter and let's see what the hell we get
10:07 - because if I get a nice pricing page man
10:10 - I'm going to start freaking using this
10:12 - this is
10:15 - exciting gone are the days of writing
10:18 - front end by hand oh my God import this
10:22 - import that do this do that oh look at
10:26 - that we got the pricing tables coming up
10:28 - boys
10:30 - and I like how it live writes it in
10:33 - front of your face that is clean dude
10:37 - that is awesome here we go choose Pro
10:40 - choose starter choose ultimate
10:43 - fantastic now we got the second one
10:46 - nice um I actually like the second one a
10:48 - lot I actually like the third one even
10:50 - more this is so cool that it gives you
10:52 - three options at the same time I love
10:54 - the third one we're going to stick with
10:55 - the third
10:57 - one uh we're going to make the pro
10:59 - package most popular can you make the
11:02 - pro package most popular
11:07 - like like add a badge or
11:11 - something
11:13 - and give all three of these different
11:18 - colors but we want the user to pick the
11:23 - pro package right because uiux is a lot
11:26 - of psychology right it's not just
11:29 - making things look pretty psychology
11:31 - like what Behavior do we want to drive
11:33 - so like we want to drive the behavior
11:34 - where the user picks um the
11:39 - happened just vanish
11:45 - hello that was
11:48 - weird is it ever going to come
11:54 - back what's happening
11:56 - here I'm so lost
11:59 - oh you can even pick an edit like that
12:02 - whoa it did it it did it it did it most
12:04 - popular badge we got three different
12:08 - colors
12:10 - um colors seem a bit too tacky and
12:15 - sharp I I don't know if I'm using the
12:17 - right lingo I'm probably using the wrong
12:19 - lingo can you make
12:23 - them can you give them a little more Gra
12:31 - um make it look better I don't know I'm
12:35 - not a friend end developer okay so some
12:37 - other frontend developer can come in and
12:38 - tell me but it got the most popular
12:41 - badge which is absolutely fantastic it
12:44 - got you know it got the different colors
12:46 - which is amazing I mean I don't really
12:48 - mind the colors I think the colors
12:49 - actually look pretty good they just look
12:52 - a tiny bit on the cheap side and I I I
12:55 - feel like if it was like like glass or
12:58 - neomorph
12:59 - oh maybe I could tell it that maybe I
13:01 - could be
13:03 - like try making
13:05 - it oh I think it added a gradient right
13:10 - like this has a gradient those other
13:12 - ones didn't the gradient does look nicer
13:15 - try making it
13:17 - neomorphic ooh big word hopefully I'm
13:20 - using the right word and I'm not using
13:22 - the one where you're your
13:25 - um
13:27 - your
13:29 - you you like dead people you know I hope
13:32 - I'm not using that one I think that's a
13:34 - Nyo
13:36 - Maniac um please YouTube Don't
13:39 - demonetize this that's not my
13:42 - [Laughter]
13:44 - intention all right let's see I'm
13:48 - excited let's see what happens here so I
13:51 - do like the gradient and like look at
13:52 - that the gradient is slick if I asked
13:55 - that the Chad GPT Chad GPT would just
13:57 - like rip off everything thing and just
13:59 - gave me like a H2 just like one
14:02 - H2 nothing
14:04 - else okay so it did make it neomorphic
14:07 - like you see how it pops out like pops
14:09 - out from the screen when I hover over on
14:11 - it and all that
14:13 - stuff that's
14:15 - awesome um Okay cool so I think we get
14:18 - it right like how it's working and what
14:20 - it could do now we could Fork share it
14:23 - so we could share this with people so
14:25 - interesting okay so if I go here and I
14:28 - paste this
14:30 - wow it just brings you straight up so
14:32 - you could just like build design so fast
14:35 - and share it can you
14:37 - imagine a product manager or somebody
14:39 - who's even a a product person or
14:42 - somebody who's a design person can now
14:44 - just coat it up just talk to CH GPT or
14:46 - talk to versel uh v.d right I mean come
14:51 - up with better names guys you you you
14:52 - know it's some Dev right they gave it
14:54 - the freaking name vzero sounds so cool
14:57 - ha like guys come on let's come up with
15:00 - a better name for this right but you
15:04 - know that if you are a frontend
15:07 - developer you could just build stuff
15:10 - with this then you got the code right
15:13 - and then from here this is all your
15:15 - front- end code and then you use Chad
15:16 - GPT to write all the backend code and oh
15:19 - my God like that's it this is it I'm so
15:22 - excited this is freaking
15:24 - revolutionary uh to add wait hold on add
15:27 - the component by using the
15:29 - code
15:31 - interesting
15:34 - wow you can add it as a component that
15:37 - is sick so you could actually just go
15:40 - npx vzer add blah blah blah right and
15:43 - then you actually don't need to carry
15:45 - around this code then it seems like you
15:47 - could just call this component so there
15:49 - you go guys that was the first look at
15:52 - v0o vers Sal's brand new generative UI
15:56 - that they released today
15:59 - couple of hours ago in beta that now
16:02 - everybody could use so check it out at
16:05 - vz. Dev but here's the thing right I
16:09 - said frontend developers are
16:11 - dead you still need the developers to
16:14 - massage it and do stuff you saw how we
16:17 - needed to do that we needed to guide it
16:19 - and give it Direction so no development
16:22 - isn't over coding is not over
16:25 - understanding it is still necessary you
16:26 - still need to give it the vision of what
16:28 - you want that's still
16:29 - necessary the same reason a boss needs
16:32 - developers he has a vision for an app
16:36 - and then he gets a team and then that
16:38 - team helps brings that Vision to life
16:40 - now you're going to be the boss every
16:42 - developer is now a boss with a team of
16:44 - almost imagine Junior developer coders
16:45 - that can code for you you give them a
16:47 - Direction I want a pricing page I want
16:50 - it to look like this I want to have
16:51 - these things I wanted to make it pop put
16:54 - a most popular badge on it boom it'll do
16:57 - all of that rather than you you having
16:58 - sitting there figuring out how do I get
17:00 - a badge where do I put a badge how do I
17:03 - make it look like a badge doesn't look
17:04 - like a badge how do I put the red border
17:07 - behind it all Annoying stuff anyways so
17:11 - no your jobs are not going away if you
17:14 - learn how to use Ai and you learn how to
17:16 - use chbt you'll be able to land your
17:18 - dream jobs get the promotions you're

18:35 - joined in so now they're both taking the
18:37 - course together and they're looking to
18:39 - build they're looking to learn better
18:42 - coding skills so they can make their
18:43 - apps and they're so excited because they
18:46 - have a couple of weeks off right now and
18:48 - so they're going to work together and
18:49 - code together and build apps together

Cleaned transcript:

frontend devs are done or so I've heard with versel v0 coming out I've been so excited to check it out all day but I purposely decided not to so I could react live with you in real time so let's go ahead and check out versel v0 which is apparently generative UI meaning you go to versel type in stuff it creates front end for you so let's see what the heck this is about all right so generating UI announcing v0 a few weeks ago we introduced it a product makes website creation as simple as describing your ideas we call it generative UI combining the best practices of front end development with the potential of generative AI the interest in V has been incredible with 100,000 people registering for the weight list in just 3 weeks today we're transitioning from alpha to Beta okay our goal is help developers B build the first iteration of their product like Ingo who built the first version of the Resume Builder product of the vzer or Brain Trust a new platform that built its pricing page using vzer Okay so let's take a look somebody built their pricing page all right okay so this was apparently built with v0 interesting okay let's take a look at this Resume Builder this was also built with VZ okay great I mean this is a lot of stuff that it's doing okay is there a way I can use it can I use it get started oh here we go okay v.d so if you go to v.d you can use it as well uh okay an eCommerce store for software developer merch okay let's see I got to authenticate so let's go go ahead and do that continue with GitHub sure oh man I hate this authentication I'll need to get my oh looks like it worked okay use generative AI to create copy and paste friendly react code based on Shad CDN UI and Tailwind okay great all right so how is this different than Chad GPT so far I'm confused oh mine was dark mode cuz I had my dark mode plugin enabled it's called Dark reader when you submit a prompt or up or an upload an image VZ will use AI to generate three different uis okay a pricing section with a title and description okay nice you can select individual parts of a generated UI to refine your creation or edit the code directly once you're ready you can then copy paste it into your react app and ship make this longer blah blah blah okay welcome start generating let's go let's see what this is about all right so I'm going to hit enter and let's see what happens I'm excited boys and girl probably the one girl that watches this channel if you're a girl comment below we we need some more ladies up in here this is too much too many boys on this channel all right so it's actually building it if you guys could see at the bottom I can see it's starting to build it interesting okay so it looks like it's building a a yeah is is it building three different versions did it say that and I'm just like tweaking right now or is one side building the Navar and then the other side is building something else wow this is great like when you code with Chad GPT you guys know how it makes it look like ass when you get the front end from there it looks so terrible and this front end looks amazing like this is usable front end that's amazing okay so it gave G me three options I guess so I I I like option A I like having this sidebar and then being able to do this okay what else can we do here so I'm going to say um call The Shop clever programmer programmer okay and then on the leftand side on the left hand side add a donate button okay um and for join now button say let's see so this so basically here I wanted to add a donate button here I wanted to say clever programmer and here join now I wanted to actually say join today to save $100 um I don't even know if that'll fit there but we'll see I'm going to hit enter and let's just see what happens it might crash it might shut down it might do something awful but we'll see this is exciting you guys this is this is revolutionary uh I'm I'm so genuinely excited about this cuz I want to be coding I hate doing front end I want to do backend stuff it makes me feel like I'm enjoying my life instead of changing colors of buttons for hours or positioning ooh here we go so we got a button that says donate okay fantastic we got clever programmer and it figured out how to do it in a really smart way it goes join our membership join today to save $100 on exclusive discounts and perks guys give it up for v0 this is fantastic um okay let's uh oh wait I can get the code holy look at that I got full react code here and I bet I could paste it somewhere and it would work and I got the HTML okay so let's try this HTML and let's put it in code pen we'll start say we'll say start coding paste it here and yeah I mean of course it'll look like because we don't have styling right does does it do inline styling how's it doing styling oh yes because we don't have Tailwind uh it's using Tailwind styling how do you enable Tailwind here let's see Tailwind in code pen can we do Tailwind in code pen how to use tailwind and code pin Okay so somebody has a page that has Tailwind I guess somehow um that's what we need we just need the Tailwind CDN I think okay I don't use codepen a lot so if you're like oh you can just do it this way it's okay like relax I don't I don't use it all the time okay so that's why close there we go look at that we're getting the styling beautiful it doesn't look perfectly like the one we wanted but it's still there and I bet if we actually looked at the react version probably that's just up and running so if you go to repet you can just probably have it up and running or stack Blitz and have it up and running but nonetheless like the point is that it works right that's the point like look at this it's even responsive so if I actually go like this right you see that how it just turned responsive and it hit the nav bar right and now when I go here boom it brings it back like that is crazy cuz I again I just remember right like how bad Chad gpt's front end code was if you asked Chad GPT for this it would have give you something that you would want to vomit at if it if it gave you and this is so damn good this is very exciting good job versel whoever is behind this that's fantastic okay I can go back to the canvas now I can also do new generation if I'm done with this right so let's say we're done with our little ecommer store Vibes we can leave this and then to add functionality you could go back to Chad GPT o interesting so here's new generations a button with Border Great so if you need a button you could do that uh SAS results page interesting pricing is something very common so let's go pricing or testimonials are also really common so let's say give me a pricing page with three uh PR uh three tables one for starter second for pro and third for ultimate ultimate uh starter should be $300 Pro should be I don't know like let's say 1K uh and ultimate should be 3K okay so those are the three packages we have and then put in different things that should be included in there for example the $300 one uh should just have a course and 1K should have group coaching and the 3K one should also include one on ones okay let's hit enter and let's see what the hell we get because if I get a nice pricing page man I'm going to start freaking using this this is exciting gone are the days of writing front end by hand oh my God import this import that do this do that oh look at that we got the pricing tables coming up boys and I like how it live writes it in front of your face that is clean dude that is awesome here we go choose Pro choose starter choose ultimate fantastic now we got the second one nice um I actually like the second one a lot I actually like the third one even more this is so cool that it gives you three options at the same time I love the third one we're going to stick with the third one uh we're going to make the pro package most popular can you make the pro package most popular like like add a badge or something and give all three of these different colors but we want the user to pick the pro package right because uiux is a lot of psychology right it's not just making things look pretty psychology like what Behavior do we want to drive so like we want to drive the behavior where the user picks um the happened just vanish hello that was weird is it ever going to come back what's happening here I'm so lost oh you can even pick an edit like that whoa it did it it did it it did it most popular badge we got three different colors um colors seem a bit too tacky and sharp I I don't know if I'm using the right lingo I'm probably using the wrong lingo can you make them can you give them a little more Gra um make it look better I don't know I'm not a friend end developer okay so some other frontend developer can come in and tell me but it got the most popular badge which is absolutely fantastic it got you know it got the different colors which is amazing I mean I don't really mind the colors I think the colors actually look pretty good they just look a tiny bit on the cheap side and I I I feel like if it was like like glass or neomorph oh maybe I could tell it that maybe I could be like try making it oh I think it added a gradient right like this has a gradient those other ones didn't the gradient does look nicer try making it neomorphic ooh big word hopefully I'm using the right word and I'm not using the one where you're your um your you you like dead people you know I hope I'm not using that one I think that's a Nyo Maniac um please YouTube Don't demonetize this that's not my [Laughter] intention all right let's see I'm excited let's see what happens here so I do like the gradient and like look at that the gradient is slick if I asked that the Chad GPT Chad GPT would just like rip off everything thing and just gave me like a H2 just like one H2 nothing else okay so it did make it neomorphic like you see how it pops out like pops out from the screen when I hover over on it and all that stuff that's awesome um Okay cool so I think we get it right like how it's working and what it could do now we could Fork share it so we could share this with people so interesting okay so if I go here and I paste this wow it just brings you straight up so you could just like build design so fast and share it can you imagine a product manager or somebody who's even a a product person or somebody who's a design person can now just coat it up just talk to CH GPT or talk to versel uh v.d right I mean come up with better names guys you you you know it's some Dev right they gave it the freaking name vzero sounds so cool ha like guys come on let's come up with a better name for this right but you know that if you are a frontend developer you could just build stuff with this then you got the code right and then from here this is all your front end code and then you use Chad GPT to write all the backend code and oh my God like that's it this is it I'm so excited this is freaking revolutionary uh to add wait hold on add the component by using the code interesting wow you can add it as a component that is sick so you could actually just go npx vzer add blah blah blah right and then you actually don't need to carry around this code then it seems like you could just call this component so there you go guys that was the first look at v0o vers Sal's brand new generative UI that they released today couple of hours ago in beta that now everybody could use so check it out at vz. Dev but here's the thing right I said frontend developers are dead you still need the developers to massage it and do stuff you saw how we needed to do that we needed to guide it and give it Direction so no development isn't over coding is not over understanding it is still necessary you still need to give it the vision of what you want that's still necessary the same reason a boss needs developers he has a vision for an app and then he gets a team and then that team helps brings that Vision to life now you're going to be the boss every developer is now a boss with a team of almost imagine Junior developer coders that can code for you you give them a Direction I want a pricing page I want it to look like this I want to have these things I wanted to make it pop put a most popular badge on it boom it'll do all of that rather than you you having sitting there figuring out how do I get a badge where do I put a badge how do I make it look like a badge doesn't look like a badge how do I put the red border behind it all Annoying stuff anyways so no your jobs are not going away if you learn how to use Ai and you learn how to use chbt you'll be able to land your dream jobs get the promotions you're looking for and land literally your dream career so if you are serious and you want to learn how to use Ai and chpt to make money and learn the skills you need to land the job or become an entrepreneur and launch even your own SAS then what I recommend you do is click the link in the description below I just launched my course profit with AI and Chad GPT where you learn skills like these and you learn how to make your first dollar selling your own SAS within 8 weeks we have students doing that in their first week we have students building their first app within 15 minutes of joining the course if you don't trust me go click the link below and check out the page look at all the testimonials read them through look at the course and then jump in okay once you jump in you have a 60day money bag guarantee so you can always decide to change your mind later so you have nothing to lose but I promise you the core is going to blow your mind I even had a father today join and he got his his son joined a few days ago and then now his son told his dad that the course is absolutely amazing so now the dad joined in so now they're both taking the course together and they're looking to build they're looking to learn better coding skills so they can make their apps and they're so excited because they have a couple of weeks off right now and so they're going to work together and code together and build apps together before the year is over so I want you to join in on that Community because the community of this course is absolutely amazing we also have a WhatsApp group where we get together and build all of these things and we're always on the latest and greatest with AI and Tech and we have students in here or who are looking at jobs at some of the biggest companies in the world and so if they come up with opportunities or find them they'll also be able to share some of those with you okay so if you're excited about this and you want to learn about AI chat GPT how to use all these tools like vzer Dev and how do you stay on top of all of the stuff so you can keep building with it and inste of becoming replaced you become IR replaceable so if that excites you cuz I know it freaking excites me and you want to be a part of this community click the link below jump in because prices are going to go up okay they're going to go up especially within the next few days before the New Year's I promise I will have increased the price of this course by at least another $100 so don't miss out because you're going to be upset so click the link below jump in the course I want to see your beautiful face inside that's it I'm Cy I'll see you in the next video peace
