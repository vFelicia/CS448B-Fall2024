00:02 - oh hey there everybody how is it going
00:06 - you are watching qazi from
00:08 - cleverprogrammer.com and this is
00:10 - codecademy part 5.
00:12 - so
00:13 - let's get started
00:15 - just kidding everybody this is actually
00:17 - part six
00:18 - i just wanted to see if you were paying
00:20 - attention
00:22 - all right so check it out we are at 30
00:25 - we are getting
00:27 - we're almost getting there okay so
00:30 - first of all i want you to take some
00:32 - time out and pat yourself on the back
00:34 - for getting this far because you are
00:36 - quite far in the project all right but
00:38 - that's the reason i'm sitting here and
00:40 - doing this with you so you feel like
00:42 - we're we're in it together right
00:44 - so let's keep plowing through this and
00:47 - hopefully we will get it done very soon
00:50 - we're at 30 already okay so don't give
00:52 - up now because this is the part where it
00:55 - all starts getting better and you get to
00:57 - use what you've learned
01:00 - all right so we're gonna find python and
01:03 - we're gonna hit continue
01:07 - okay so
01:09 - just for people who are maybe
01:11 - catching you know coming in right now
01:14 - um
01:15 - we are at the part
01:18 - we finish python syntax tip calculator
01:20 - conditionals and control flow pig latin
01:23 - functions and we're starting from taking
01:25 - a vacation
01:27 - hard day at work
01:29 - rough day at school
01:31 - take a load off with a programming
01:33 - vacation
01:34 - that's the one we're on all right so
01:36 - let's click on it and let's get started
01:39 - this one is still has to do with
01:40 - functions so we're gonna continue
01:42 - talking about this one
01:46 - okay
01:53 - so this function is called bigger it
01:56 - takes in first value second value and it
01:58 - figures out which one is bigger so
02:00 - that's really simple i think we can
02:02 - go through it and write it together
02:04 - write a function called answer that
02:06 - takes no arguments and returns a value
02:09 - 42
02:12 - okay cool
02:14 - so how this function right here works
02:16 - i'm gonna write it out bigger
02:18 - first comma
02:22 - and again variable names here don't
02:24 - matter you can say x and y
02:26 - but
02:27 - in programming generally you want to use
02:29 - better variable names and avoid one
02:31 - letter variable names because you're
02:32 - going to look at it later you're going
02:33 - to be like what the heck was going on
02:35 - here
02:40 - okay so print max of first comma second
02:45 - all right what this does
02:47 - function max figure out what the max is
02:49 - so here if you put in let's say 5 and
02:53 - then
02:54 - 10
02:55 - the function max is going to go and
02:56 - check hey it's 5 greater than 10
02:59 - it's going to say no so then it's going
03:01 - to pick 10 as your max
03:04 - and then we just return true so that's
03:07 - really what this thing is doing here we
03:09 - define a function called bigger
03:11 - done we defined a function called bigger
03:13 - it takes you two arguments
03:15 - and then
03:16 - if we print out the larger one and then
03:18 - finally the function itself returns true
03:22 - in step three okay now we try creating a
03:24 - function ourselves so we're gonna write
03:26 - a function
03:27 - or i'm just gonna leave this this here
03:29 - for you guys in comments
03:33 - okay cool define answer
03:37 - and
03:38 - it takes in no arguments so remember the
03:41 - stuff that goes in parentheses those are
03:43 - called arguments or parameters okay if i
03:46 - had it like this this takes in two
03:48 - arguments so this one takes no arguments
03:51 - and returns
03:52 - 42 okay that's all this function does
03:58 - so if i took this function it's a pretty
04:00 - simple function and i went into idle and
04:02 - i pasted it here
04:04 - and then i called this function you see
04:06 - all it does is it just keeps going 42.
04:08 - so i can say something like the answer
04:11 - to life is
04:14 - and we're going to use some string
04:15 - concatenation here
04:18 - is
04:22 - 42. the answer to life is 42.
04:25 - the str thing i did is so it converts
04:27 - this integer data type to a string data
04:30 - type
04:31 - and that way it allows me to actually
04:33 - mix and match them together
04:35 - otherwise it'll give me an error so for
04:37 - example if i don't do the str function
04:39 - on answer i'll get an error that'll say
04:41 - can't convert into object to string
04:44 - object or string implicitly cool
04:47 - save it's mint boom you finish this
04:50 - section planes hotels and automobiles
04:54 - when taking a vacation it's very
04:56 - important to know exactly how much you
04:57 - are going to spend
05:00 - okay so they have a function called
05:02 - wages which takes in an input called
05:05 - hours
05:06 - and then it does
05:08 - 8.35
05:10 - times hours let's say our hourly
05:13 - hourly
05:16 - rate is equal to 8.35
05:19 - so
05:20 - we can just
05:22 - you know just just for the sake of
05:24 - clarity here right hourly rate times
05:27 - hours will give you how much is your
05:29 - wage
05:30 - okay
05:30 - so if you write a function wage which is
05:33 - supposed to calculate your
05:35 - how much money you make in a day or
05:38 - however long of a period period
05:40 - it's dependent on information it's
05:42 - dependent on one important information
05:44 - right it's dependent on
05:46 - hours and i would like to argue that
05:48 - this function should also be dependent
05:50 - on your hourly rate
05:52 - right so it should really be like
05:57 - so you give it your hourly rate and your
05:59 - hours and then it spits out something so
06:01 - for example let me show you guys what i
06:03 - mean by this i'm going to take this and
06:06 - i'm going to go here and you guys should
06:08 - follow along and try to use this wage
06:11 - calculator and do something fun right so
06:13 - this is what i always tell
06:15 - my students or
06:17 - really whoever wants to learn
06:18 - programming is don't just look at this
06:21 - stuff do something with this information
06:23 - so maybe build something that helps you
06:26 - so i you know if you have a job
06:28 - do something that'll calculate you know
06:30 - you just put in hours and automatically
06:32 - calculates how much money you make for
06:34 - so
06:35 - for instance i'm going to create this
06:37 - function wages which takes an hourly
06:40 - rate and then hours and then it returns
06:42 - your wages or wage
06:44 - so i'm going to say i'm going to call
06:46 - this function with let's say hourly rate
06:48 - is 20
06:50 - an hour
06:51 - and you worked
06:52 - uh 15 hours and it returns 300 okay just
06:57 - to keep it simple if i have if i make 10
07:00 - an hour and i work for 10 hours
07:02 - boom
07:03 - okay
07:04 - and
07:07 - i think we can also do this
07:11 - passing keyword arguments
07:14 - okay so
07:18 - cool all right this is great let's move
07:21 - oh sorry so they want us to create a
07:23 - different function so i'm going to leave
07:24 - this up here
07:27 - define a function called hotel okay
07:30 - hotel cost
07:31 - with one argument nights so already i'm
07:34 - thinking the function is called
07:37 - hotel cost and it's dependent on the
07:40 - nights so i'm thinking if i give this
07:42 - hotel cost the number of nights i lived
07:45 - here then it will give me back the hotel
07:48 - cost okay so that's generally how
07:50 - functions
07:51 - work
07:52 - you name a function based on what it's
07:54 - supposed to tell you and then you put in
07:57 - as input the information it requires to
08:00 - calculate everything
08:02 - okay
08:03 - the hotel costs um
08:06 - 140 per night so the function should
08:09 - total return
08:11 - 140 times nights
08:14 - okay
08:15 - and to make it more readable i can say
08:20 - per night
08:22 - is equal to 140
08:24 - and then i want to do per
08:27 - night
08:29 - rate
08:32 - times nights okay so when somebody's
08:35 - reading this code they're not going to
08:36 - be like what is 140 where did it come
08:39 - from
08:40 - they now know very clearly that it's the
08:42 - night you know one night rate
08:45 - okay cool start next lesson
08:50 - all right
08:51 - getting there you're going to need to
08:54 - take a plane ride to get to your
08:55 - location okay
08:57 - now before we do that they're giving us
08:59 - an example of a function that does if
09:01 - else if else else if and then else at
09:04 - some point but else if yeah
09:06 - so the function is called fruit color it
09:08 - takes in an argument of fruit and if the
09:11 - fruit was apple it will return red if
09:13 - the fruit was banana returns yellow else
09:16 - if the fruit was pear it returns green
09:19 - so
09:19 - i'm gonna take this function we're going
09:22 - to go to our idle we're going to paste
09:23 - it there
09:24 - and i'm going to say
09:27 - fruit color
09:28 - and i will say
09:32 - so the function is called fruit color
09:34 - but in for an argument it takes in a
09:36 - fruit okay so we're going to give it
09:38 - apple
09:39 - and you're going to see it return red
09:41 - now i'm going to give it banana it's
09:43 - going to turn yellow
09:44 - and if i gave it pear it turns green
09:48 - okay that's how that works
09:52 - okay below your existing code define a
09:54 - function
09:56 - called plain write cost that takes in
09:59 - the string city as input the function
10:02 - should return a different price
10:04 - depending on the locations
10:06 - similar to the code example above below
10:09 - the valid destinations and their
10:11 - corresponding round-trip prices
10:15 - okay we have tampa pittsburgh los
10:17 - angeles
10:19 - and all of that so we're going to write
10:21 - some simple if then statements there are
10:22 - better ways to do it
10:24 - for example using a dictionary but for
10:27 - in our case we're just going to use if
10:28 - then statements so
10:30 - if city equal equal
10:34 - you know charlotte
10:37 - we are going to say
10:40 - return 183
10:43 - else if city is
10:50 - it doesn't matter if you put double
10:51 - quotes or single quotes just as long as
10:53 - you just remain consistent with it okay
10:56 - also if
10:57 - pittsburgh
10:59 - i just like to put single quotes because
11:01 - then i don't have to hit shift every
11:02 - time i do it
11:04 - oh i did it the other way
11:07 - city equal equal
11:09 - like that
11:11 - return 222 else if city equal equal los
11:15 - angeles
11:18 - returned whoops
11:21 - 475.
11:24 - okay i think this should be good
11:27 - okay that was fairly simple
11:30 - uh you're going to need a rental car in
11:32 - order for you to get there here they
11:34 - have they're showing you how to use
11:36 - comparison operators if score is greater
11:38 - than or equal to 10 then increment the
11:41 - score by 50 or increment the tickets by
11:43 - 50
11:45 - and
11:46 - if the score is greater than or equal to
11:48 - 7 increment the tickets by 20 and then
11:51 - return tickets
11:53 - so
11:54 - just to give you guys what that means
11:58 - uh if i have something called tickets
12:01 - right and there are 50 tickets and let's
12:03 - say i want to increment the variable
12:04 - tickets by 10. so
12:07 - after this line of code
12:09 - tickets should actually be
12:11 - 60 and not 50. okay so a lot of people
12:15 - will try this and that's what i
12:17 - initially would try but if you go back
12:19 - to tickets you'll see that tickets are
12:21 - still 50 so you haven't done your job
12:23 - correctly
12:24 - how we actually increment the value of
12:26 - tickets so the next time we print out
12:28 - tickets it says 60 is like this tickets
12:30 - is equal to
12:32 - what tickets previously was plus
12:35 - 10 okay
12:36 - now if you do tickets you see it says
12:38 - 60.
12:40 - so this is a pretty common operation
12:43 - okay now if i do tickets again it's 70.
12:46 - so tickets equals tickets plus 10. all
12:49 - right
12:50 - now the shortcut since this is such a
12:53 - common operation we have a shortcut for
12:55 - it in our programming languages python
12:58 - java c plus plus whatever
13:00 - um
13:01 - so the shortcut here is actually this
13:07 - plus equals
13:08 - now if i go back to tickets you'll see
13:10 - it says 80.
13:12 - if i do it again and i go back and take
13:13 - its lc
13:15 - right
13:15 - you'll see it says 100 now
13:17 - so it's just the shortcut is plus equal
13:19 - because it's such a common operation for
13:21 - you guys
13:23 - if you're new
13:24 - write it explicitly right tickets is
13:26 - equal to tickets plus 10.
13:29 - okay
13:30 - and um
13:32 - yeah make sure you write it explicitly
13:34 - all right
13:37 - um and then once you really understand
13:39 - it and you can really use it every
13:40 - single time correctly then move on to
13:43 - the shortcut
13:46 - all right now let's go on to what
13:48 - they're saying below your existing code
13:49 - define a function called
13:54 - define rental
13:56 - car
13:57 - cost with argument days so i'm thinking
14:00 - already that it will tell me the
14:03 - rental car cost
14:05 - based on the number of days that i give
14:07 - it okay
14:09 - calculate the cost of renting car every
14:11 - day you rent the car costs forty dollars
14:14 - okay
14:16 - so
14:17 - every day each day
14:20 - so day rate is equal to 40 is what i
14:23 - would say if you rent a car for
14:26 - seven
14:28 - or more days
14:29 - you get 50 off
14:32 - if
14:35 - days is
14:39 - seven or more
14:46 - okay if if days is equal is greater than
14:49 - or equal to seven
14:51 - then we are going to
14:54 - decrement
14:56 - or no no we're not
15:00 - so i'm going to say total cost
15:04 - is equal to nothing in the start
15:07 - and then total
15:09 - cost
15:10 - minus equals 50 which is the same thing
15:13 - as saying
15:16 - cos minus 50.
15:19 - okay
15:31 - uh total cost we're going to do day rate
15:34 - times days
15:36 - all right that should be our total cost
15:39 - and then we're gonna subtract fifty
15:41 - dollars from the total cost if the
15:44 - rented days was greater than or equal to
15:45 - seven
15:47 - okay
15:48 - and else if
15:51 - you rent the car
15:53 - for three or more days
15:57 - you
16:01 - get
16:02 - twenty dollars off
16:05 - you cannot get both of the above
16:07 - discounts meaning
16:09 - um
16:11 - well meaning you cannot get both of the
16:12 - above discount so if you actually did an
16:14 - if statement it'll go if
16:16 - blah blah will give you a 50 discount
16:18 - and then it'll go on to this if
16:20 - statement and then it'll say oh great
16:22 - since okay let's say you rented the car
16:24 - for 10 days it'll give you the 50
16:25 - discount and then it'll go to this
16:27 - statement it'll say
16:28 - is days greater than or equal to three
16:30 - it'll
16:31 - say yes
16:32 - and it'll give you a 20 discount as well
16:36 - okay
16:37 - so
16:38 - effectively
16:39 - what you want to be able to do here is
16:41 - so if this part is true the if condition
16:43 - stops
16:46 - elsif is a great use case for that so if
16:48 - this is not true then it's going to go
16:50 - and check if this condition is true okay
16:52 - only if this condition is not true
16:56 - so that's the subtle difference between
16:58 - else if or alif
17:00 - and
17:01 - if
17:03 - and at the end we simply return cost so
17:06 - we return
17:08 - total cost right that's the variable we
17:10 - were using
17:11 - and this should be good
17:13 - boom okay done good
17:17 - pull it together
17:19 - so
17:22 - now you've got your three main costs
17:24 - figured out let's put them in order
17:28 - and use them
17:33 - find the total cost of your trip
17:37 - okay so here they're
17:41 - um so they're just giving you an example
17:43 - to create a function called double which
17:45 - just multiply something by two then they
17:47 - create a function called triple which
17:49 - takes in p as input multiplies p by
17:51 - three so it just multiplies a number by
17:53 - three and then now they're showing you
17:56 - how you can use both of the functions
17:58 - you define in one main function so here
18:01 - in the function called add they're using
18:04 - the function double that's defined up
18:06 - here
18:07 - and they're using the function called
18:09 - triple it's defined up there
18:12 - okay
18:16 - below your existing code define a
18:18 - function called trip cost so we're going
18:20 - to use this function called trip cost
18:22 - it's really going to put everything else
18:24 - in to
18:26 - perspective trip cost
18:29 - that takes two arguments city and days
18:32 - like the example above have your
18:34 - function return the sum of calling the
18:36 - rental car
18:38 - cost days
18:41 - hotel cost and okay so
18:46 - what i'm gonna do here
18:48 - is something along the lines of this
18:51 - return rental
18:53 - car
18:54 - cost
18:56 - and pass in the days we gave it
18:58 - plus
19:00 - hotel costs
19:02 - and the days that we were there
19:05 - plus
19:08 - um plane
19:12 - ride cost and that function takes in the
19:16 - city and luckily we have the city right
19:19 - here
19:22 - it is completely valid to call the hotel
19:24 - cost knights function with the variable
19:26 - days just like the example above
19:29 - okay
19:30 - and this should really do the trick okay
19:32 - what i'm gonna do is we're gonna play
19:35 - around with this a little bit okay i
19:36 - don't want you to do just everything the
19:38 - codecademy tells you to do because
19:40 - you're not going to truly understand it
19:42 - so it's good to take some time out and
19:44 - really play with it the more time you
19:46 - spend
19:47 - like you know playing around with this
19:50 - and not actually just doing the
19:54 - codecademy the better you're gonna get
19:57 - with programming you're gonna it's gonna
19:59 - become more natural to you and you're
20:00 - gonna really understand these concepts
20:01 - okay because understanding these
20:03 - concepts is not
20:04 - oh like check mark i finished this
20:07 - section check mark i know everything
20:08 - about functions i did this i know
20:09 - everything about the math operations
20:11 - it's really when you take out the extra
20:13 - time and just do something for fun for
20:16 - yourself
20:17 - it could be whatever really
20:21 - so i'm going to
20:25 - why is it saying invalid syntax
20:29 - if i paste it in my terminal does the
20:31 - same value syntax yes it does
20:34 - why is it saying invalid syntax
20:43 - um
20:45 - okay let's go to dot it and try it there
20:48 - because
20:50 - i
20:51 - it's really a lot it's a lot more
20:53 - helpful to
20:56 - be able to actually
20:58 - run this and practice it
21:00 - so repple that it does not complain
21:04 - right so we have all these functions now
21:06 - let's try using them okay for example
21:10 - let's try using the hotel cos
21:13 - function let's give it uh
21:15 - we stayed let's say we went to france
21:17 - and we stayed there for five nights
21:20 - and we're gonna say prince
21:25 - hotel cost
21:27 - you can see 700 right five times 140 is
21:31 - 700.
21:34 - okay now let's go to plane right cost
21:36 - and give it city so let's go to
21:40 - print plane ride cost and we give it a
21:43 - city and let's say we give it
21:45 - pits
21:48 - berg
21:50 - okay
21:51 - and now if i run it
21:53 - you can see that it says 222 right there
21:58 - okay
21:59 - um and how it figured it out is that
22:01 - when the city of charlotte it said nope
22:03 - city is tampa nope city is pittsburgh it
22:06 - evaluated to true and then it returned
22:08 - to 222.
22:11 - let's use our
22:13 - third function rental car cost
22:16 - which takes in the days let's give it 20
22:20 - days
22:21 - and
22:22 - run this
22:25 - so really it's 40
22:28 - times 40 times 20 that gave us 800
22:32 - and then it says 20 days is greater than
22:35 - 7 it subtracted 50 and that's how we got
22:38 - 750 right there
22:41 - okay
22:43 - and
22:48 - the last function
22:50 - and let's
22:52 - put
22:53 - this there so then when we use it we can
22:56 - see that actually there's
22:58 - uh it's separated from everything and
23:00 - everything else so this is going to be
23:02 - our trip cost so trip
23:04 - cost
23:07 - and for city we're gonna give it
23:12 - los angeles
23:17 - and for the number of days let's say we
23:19 - stayed there for seven days so we spent
23:21 - one week okay
23:23 - now try to figure out before running
23:25 - this exactly what the cost should be
23:27 - because that will prove to you that you
23:29 - understand this algorithm correctly
23:32 - and i'm just gonna well i guess we can
23:34 - walk through it together as well
23:36 - so seven days so it's gonna come here
23:38 - it's gonna put in
23:41 - uh it's gonna come to this function
23:43 - right trip cost
23:45 - and
23:46 - to calculate the rental car cost is
23:48 - gonna put in seven for where you see
23:51 - days right days right here is going to
23:53 - put in that days into this function
23:55 - rental car cost
23:56 - it's going to go to the function rental
23:58 - car cost put in 7 right here
24:01 - right
24:02 - then it's going to put in 7 right here
24:04 - 40 times 7 what does that give us that
24:06 - gives us 280.
24:08 - it's going to go is 7
24:11 - 7 greater than or equal to 7. it's going
24:13 - to evaluate to true we're going to get
24:15 - our 50 discount it's going to be 280
24:17 - minus
24:18 - 50 or at 230
24:20 - so far
24:23 - is going to go to hotel
24:25 - so this is going to be
24:26 - 230
24:28 - it's going to go to hotel cost function
24:31 - now
24:32 - hotel cost is going to pass in days for
24:36 - this argument nights here
24:39 - okay and since let's say we got 7
24:43 - is going to put in 7 right here which is
24:46 - going to go up here and put 7 right
24:47 - there
24:48 - and it's going to put 7 right there 140
24:51 - times 7 gives you 980
24:55 - okay
24:57 - this whole
24:59 - is thing
24:59 - to evaluate to 980
25:02 - and then we have the plane right cost
25:05 - city
25:07 - it's dependent on the city so for city
25:11 - we have los angeles
25:15 - okay
25:16 - that's gonna
25:18 - it's gonna be like this pretty much it's
25:20 - gonna go to the function plane ride cost
25:22 - it's gonna put in los angeles it's gonna
25:24 - find
25:26 - it nope this is going to trigger no
25:28 - because los angeles is not equal to
25:30 - charlotte los angeles is not equal to
25:32 - tempo does not equal to pittsburgh
25:35 - is this true yes it is so it returns 475
25:39 - this whole thing turns to 475 so
25:42 - effectively should be 230 plus 980 plus
25:46 - 475.
25:48 - your total evaluates to 16
25:52 - 85 let's see if we are
25:56 - correct here
25:58 - but that's the general idea
26:00 - okay maybe we could be off but that's
26:02 - the general idea
26:05 - so i'm going to write down my assumption
26:06 - as 1685. it's a good idea to walk
26:09 - through the algorithm by yourself
26:12 - and let's run it
26:15 - trip cost missing arguments
26:18 - oh okay
26:19 - so
26:20 - it should really be seven like this i
26:22 - wrote it incorrectly
26:26 - okay 1685 did we get 16.85
26:29 - boom so
26:31 - you can see that we nailed that one
26:32 - right we got it perfectly but it's
26:34 - important to understand how all of this
26:36 - works together we wrote three separate
26:38 - functions and then at the end we wrote
26:40 - one main function
26:42 - that uses the three helper functions
26:44 - that we wrote and so basically you never
26:47 - have to worry about these three
26:48 - functions
26:49 - you only call this one so your life is
26:52 - easier and other functions figure out
26:55 - their things but one important thing to
26:57 - note is each function does one thing
27:00 - all right we're not
27:02 - make putting everything together in one
27:04 - place where
27:05 - us it's called separation of concerns
27:08 - we're separating out
27:10 - all of our problem solving to different
27:12 - functions and then we put them together
27:14 - at the end
27:15 - and that ultimately returns something
27:18 - something hopefully accurate
27:21 - all right so that was a lot uh hopefully
27:23 - some of that makes made sense
27:27 - and as you can see we did it correctly
27:29 - so we're gonna hit start next lesson
27:33 - hey you never know
27:35 - you can't expect to only spend money on
27:37 - the plane ride hotel rental car
27:40 - when going on a vacation
27:43 - there also needs to be room for
27:44 - additional costs like fancy food or
27:46 - souvenirs so modify your trip cost
27:48 - function definition add a third argument
27:51 - called
27:52 - spending money
27:55 - modify what the trip cost function does
27:57 - add the variable spending money to the
28:00 - sum that it returns
28:04 - okay plus we could be spending a lot of
28:06 - money so that we also have to take that
28:09 - into account so now the trip cost is
28:11 - really dependent on the city the number
28:13 - of days and spending money okay
28:16 - i mean that's how you would literally
28:18 - define it in real life like hey i'm
28:19 - going on a trip
28:21 - i might ask you what do you think the
28:23 - cost is going to be dependent on
28:25 - and you're probably going to say well it
28:27 - depends what city i go to how many days
28:30 - i stay there and how much money i spend
28:33 - that's really what you're telling the
28:35 - computer as well okay
28:38 - so
28:39 - it's pretty natural to describe it i
28:41 - would think
28:42 - save and submit start next lesson plan
28:45 - your trip nah nice work now that you
28:48 - have it all together let's take a trip
28:50 - what if we want to go to los angeles for
28:52 - five days and brought an extra 600 of
28:55 - spending money so that's awesome because
28:58 - we literally just did this right we
29:00 - opened up our idol
29:02 - not that guy idol
29:04 - and we
29:05 - now hold on i'm sorry we opened up our
29:06 - repple.it
29:09 - and we literally did what they are just
29:12 - about to have you do
29:13 - except they put five days instead of los
29:16 - angeles and they added another argument
29:18 - called spending money
29:20 - all right so now they want us to
29:23 - effectively use our functions right call
29:25 - them
29:26 - so i'm going to say trip cost
29:30 - make sure to do print here
29:32 - it's python 2. so i don't need to put
29:34 - parentheses after the print statement
29:37 - i'm going to say los angeles
29:39 - i'm gonna say five and spending money
29:41 - six hundred dollars
29:43 - and then we save and submit and we get
29:46 - 19.55
29:48 - cool
29:49 - so that was excellent i
29:53 - we went together and we finished this
29:55 - thing
29:56 - right through
29:58 - now we are on the next section okay
30:01 - let's go back to the course page
30:05 - we just finished taking a vacation we
30:07 - are on unit 5 lists and dictionaries
30:10 - great job seriously guys great job for
30:13 - making it this far because
30:14 - i know it gets tough as you go on
30:17 - and it's conceptually harder there's
30:19 - also more work involved but trust me
30:21 - because this is when it starts to get
30:23 - fun and you can start to do powerful
30:25 - things i mean look down you can already
30:27 - do rock paper scissors
30:29 - a student becomes teacher so
30:31 - being able to manage classes write
30:33 - programs i can intelligently figure out
30:35 - who got a b c d so you don't have to do
30:38 - that
30:39 - and much more like make your own games
30:41 - like battleship okay
30:43 - so we are getting into the stuff that
30:46 - will make you help you do really
30:47 - powerful things
30:49 - so don't get discouraged now let's keep
30:51 - playing through it i will see you guys
30:52 - in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

oh hey there everybody how is it going you are watching qazi from cleverprogrammer.com and this is codecademy part 5. so let's get started just kidding everybody this is actually part six i just wanted to see if you were paying attention all right so check it out we are at 30 we are getting we're almost getting there okay so first of all i want you to take some time out and pat yourself on the back for getting this far because you are quite far in the project all right but that's the reason i'm sitting here and doing this with you so you feel like we're we're in it together right so let's keep plowing through this and hopefully we will get it done very soon we're at 30 already okay so don't give up now because this is the part where it all starts getting better and you get to use what you've learned all right so we're gonna find python and we're gonna hit continue okay so just for people who are maybe catching you know coming in right now um we are at the part we finish python syntax tip calculator conditionals and control flow pig latin functions and we're starting from taking a vacation hard day at work rough day at school take a load off with a programming vacation that's the one we're on all right so let's click on it and let's get started this one is still has to do with functions so we're gonna continue talking about this one okay so this function is called bigger it takes in first value second value and it figures out which one is bigger so that's really simple i think we can go through it and write it together write a function called answer that takes no arguments and returns a value 42 okay cool so how this function right here works i'm gonna write it out bigger first comma and again variable names here don't matter you can say x and y but in programming generally you want to use better variable names and avoid one letter variable names because you're going to look at it later you're going to be like what the heck was going on here okay so print max of first comma second all right what this does function max figure out what the max is so here if you put in let's say 5 and then 10 the function max is going to go and check hey it's 5 greater than 10 it's going to say no so then it's going to pick 10 as your max and then we just return true so that's really what this thing is doing here we define a function called bigger done we defined a function called bigger it takes you two arguments and then if we print out the larger one and then finally the function itself returns true in step three okay now we try creating a function ourselves so we're gonna write a function or i'm just gonna leave this this here for you guys in comments okay cool define answer and it takes in no arguments so remember the stuff that goes in parentheses those are called arguments or parameters okay if i had it like this this takes in two arguments so this one takes no arguments and returns 42 okay that's all this function does so if i took this function it's a pretty simple function and i went into idle and i pasted it here and then i called this function you see all it does is it just keeps going 42. so i can say something like the answer to life is and we're going to use some string concatenation here is 42. the answer to life is 42. the str thing i did is so it converts this integer data type to a string data type and that way it allows me to actually mix and match them together otherwise it'll give me an error so for example if i don't do the str function on answer i'll get an error that'll say can't convert into object to string object or string implicitly cool save it's mint boom you finish this section planes hotels and automobiles when taking a vacation it's very important to know exactly how much you are going to spend okay so they have a function called wages which takes in an input called hours and then it does 8.35 times hours let's say our hourly hourly rate is equal to 8.35 so we can just you know just just for the sake of clarity here right hourly rate times hours will give you how much is your wage okay so if you write a function wage which is supposed to calculate your how much money you make in a day or however long of a period period it's dependent on information it's dependent on one important information right it's dependent on hours and i would like to argue that this function should also be dependent on your hourly rate right so it should really be like so you give it your hourly rate and your hours and then it spits out something so for example let me show you guys what i mean by this i'm going to take this and i'm going to go here and you guys should follow along and try to use this wage calculator and do something fun right so this is what i always tell my students or really whoever wants to learn programming is don't just look at this stuff do something with this information so maybe build something that helps you so i you know if you have a job do something that'll calculate you know you just put in hours and automatically calculates how much money you make for so for instance i'm going to create this function wages which takes an hourly rate and then hours and then it returns your wages or wage so i'm going to say i'm going to call this function with let's say hourly rate is 20 an hour and you worked uh 15 hours and it returns 300 okay just to keep it simple if i have if i make 10 an hour and i work for 10 hours boom okay and i think we can also do this passing keyword arguments okay so cool all right this is great let's move oh sorry so they want us to create a different function so i'm going to leave this up here define a function called hotel okay hotel cost with one argument nights so already i'm thinking the function is called hotel cost and it's dependent on the nights so i'm thinking if i give this hotel cost the number of nights i lived here then it will give me back the hotel cost okay so that's generally how functions work you name a function based on what it's supposed to tell you and then you put in as input the information it requires to calculate everything okay the hotel costs um 140 per night so the function should total return 140 times nights okay and to make it more readable i can say per night is equal to 140 and then i want to do per night rate times nights okay so when somebody's reading this code they're not going to be like what is 140 where did it come from they now know very clearly that it's the night you know one night rate okay cool start next lesson all right getting there you're going to need to take a plane ride to get to your location okay now before we do that they're giving us an example of a function that does if else if else else if and then else at some point but else if yeah so the function is called fruit color it takes in an argument of fruit and if the fruit was apple it will return red if the fruit was banana returns yellow else if the fruit was pear it returns green so i'm gonna take this function we're going to go to our idle we're going to paste it there and i'm going to say fruit color and i will say so the function is called fruit color but in for an argument it takes in a fruit okay so we're going to give it apple and you're going to see it return red now i'm going to give it banana it's going to turn yellow and if i gave it pear it turns green okay that's how that works okay below your existing code define a function called plain write cost that takes in the string city as input the function should return a different price depending on the locations similar to the code example above below the valid destinations and their corresponding roundtrip prices okay we have tampa pittsburgh los angeles and all of that so we're going to write some simple if then statements there are better ways to do it for example using a dictionary but for in our case we're just going to use if then statements so if city equal equal you know charlotte we are going to say return 183 else if city is it doesn't matter if you put double quotes or single quotes just as long as you just remain consistent with it okay also if pittsburgh i just like to put single quotes because then i don't have to hit shift every time i do it oh i did it the other way city equal equal like that return 222 else if city equal equal los angeles returned whoops 475. okay i think this should be good okay that was fairly simple uh you're going to need a rental car in order for you to get there here they have they're showing you how to use comparison operators if score is greater than or equal to 10 then increment the score by 50 or increment the tickets by 50 and if the score is greater than or equal to 7 increment the tickets by 20 and then return tickets so just to give you guys what that means uh if i have something called tickets right and there are 50 tickets and let's say i want to increment the variable tickets by 10. so after this line of code tickets should actually be 60 and not 50. okay so a lot of people will try this and that's what i initially would try but if you go back to tickets you'll see that tickets are still 50 so you haven't done your job correctly how we actually increment the value of tickets so the next time we print out tickets it says 60 is like this tickets is equal to what tickets previously was plus 10 okay now if you do tickets you see it says 60. so this is a pretty common operation okay now if i do tickets again it's 70. so tickets equals tickets plus 10. all right now the shortcut since this is such a common operation we have a shortcut for it in our programming languages python java c plus plus whatever um so the shortcut here is actually this plus equals now if i go back to tickets you'll see it says 80. if i do it again and i go back and take its lc right you'll see it says 100 now so it's just the shortcut is plus equal because it's such a common operation for you guys if you're new write it explicitly right tickets is equal to tickets plus 10. okay and um yeah make sure you write it explicitly all right um and then once you really understand it and you can really use it every single time correctly then move on to the shortcut all right now let's go on to what they're saying below your existing code define a function called define rental car cost with argument days so i'm thinking already that it will tell me the rental car cost based on the number of days that i give it okay calculate the cost of renting car every day you rent the car costs forty dollars okay so every day each day so day rate is equal to 40 is what i would say if you rent a car for seven or more days you get 50 off if days is seven or more okay if if days is equal is greater than or equal to seven then we are going to decrement or no no we're not so i'm going to say total cost is equal to nothing in the start and then total cost minus equals 50 which is the same thing as saying cos minus 50. okay uh total cost we're going to do day rate times days all right that should be our total cost and then we're gonna subtract fifty dollars from the total cost if the rented days was greater than or equal to seven okay and else if you rent the car for three or more days you get twenty dollars off you cannot get both of the above discounts meaning um well meaning you cannot get both of the above discount so if you actually did an if statement it'll go if blah blah will give you a 50 discount and then it'll go on to this if statement and then it'll say oh great since okay let's say you rented the car for 10 days it'll give you the 50 discount and then it'll go to this statement it'll say is days greater than or equal to three it'll say yes and it'll give you a 20 discount as well okay so effectively what you want to be able to do here is so if this part is true the if condition stops elsif is a great use case for that so if this is not true then it's going to go and check if this condition is true okay only if this condition is not true so that's the subtle difference between else if or alif and if and at the end we simply return cost so we return total cost right that's the variable we were using and this should be good boom okay done good pull it together so now you've got your three main costs figured out let's put them in order and use them find the total cost of your trip okay so here they're um so they're just giving you an example to create a function called double which just multiply something by two then they create a function called triple which takes in p as input multiplies p by three so it just multiplies a number by three and then now they're showing you how you can use both of the functions you define in one main function so here in the function called add they're using the function double that's defined up here and they're using the function called triple it's defined up there okay below your existing code define a function called trip cost so we're going to use this function called trip cost it's really going to put everything else in to perspective trip cost that takes two arguments city and days like the example above have your function return the sum of calling the rental car cost days hotel cost and okay so what i'm gonna do here is something along the lines of this return rental car cost and pass in the days we gave it plus hotel costs and the days that we were there plus um plane ride cost and that function takes in the city and luckily we have the city right here it is completely valid to call the hotel cost knights function with the variable days just like the example above okay and this should really do the trick okay what i'm gonna do is we're gonna play around with this a little bit okay i don't want you to do just everything the codecademy tells you to do because you're not going to truly understand it so it's good to take some time out and really play with it the more time you spend like you know playing around with this and not actually just doing the codecademy the better you're gonna get with programming you're gonna it's gonna become more natural to you and you're gonna really understand these concepts okay because understanding these concepts is not oh like check mark i finished this section check mark i know everything about functions i did this i know everything about the math operations it's really when you take out the extra time and just do something for fun for yourself it could be whatever really so i'm going to why is it saying invalid syntax if i paste it in my terminal does the same value syntax yes it does why is it saying invalid syntax um okay let's go to dot it and try it there because i it's really a lot it's a lot more helpful to be able to actually run this and practice it so repple that it does not complain right so we have all these functions now let's try using them okay for example let's try using the hotel cos function let's give it uh we stayed let's say we went to france and we stayed there for five nights and we're gonna say prince hotel cost you can see 700 right five times 140 is 700. okay now let's go to plane right cost and give it city so let's go to print plane ride cost and we give it a city and let's say we give it pits berg okay and now if i run it you can see that it says 222 right there okay um and how it figured it out is that when the city of charlotte it said nope city is tampa nope city is pittsburgh it evaluated to true and then it returned to 222. let's use our third function rental car cost which takes in the days let's give it 20 days and run this so really it's 40 times 40 times 20 that gave us 800 and then it says 20 days is greater than 7 it subtracted 50 and that's how we got 750 right there okay and the last function and let's put this there so then when we use it we can see that actually there's uh it's separated from everything and everything else so this is going to be our trip cost so trip cost and for city we're gonna give it los angeles and for the number of days let's say we stayed there for seven days so we spent one week okay now try to figure out before running this exactly what the cost should be because that will prove to you that you understand this algorithm correctly and i'm just gonna well i guess we can walk through it together as well so seven days so it's gonna come here it's gonna put in uh it's gonna come to this function right trip cost and to calculate the rental car cost is gonna put in seven for where you see days right days right here is going to put in that days into this function rental car cost it's going to go to the function rental car cost put in 7 right here right then it's going to put in 7 right here 40 times 7 what does that give us that gives us 280. it's going to go is 7 7 greater than or equal to 7. it's going to evaluate to true we're going to get our 50 discount it's going to be 280 minus 50 or at 230 so far is going to go to hotel so this is going to be 230 it's going to go to hotel cost function now hotel cost is going to pass in days for this argument nights here okay and since let's say we got 7 is going to put in 7 right here which is going to go up here and put 7 right there and it's going to put 7 right there 140 times 7 gives you 980 okay this whole is thing to evaluate to 980 and then we have the plane right cost city it's dependent on the city so for city we have los angeles okay that's gonna it's gonna be like this pretty much it's gonna go to the function plane ride cost it's gonna put in los angeles it's gonna find it nope this is going to trigger no because los angeles is not equal to charlotte los angeles is not equal to tempo does not equal to pittsburgh is this true yes it is so it returns 475 this whole thing turns to 475 so effectively should be 230 plus 980 plus 475. your total evaluates to 16 85 let's see if we are correct here but that's the general idea okay maybe we could be off but that's the general idea so i'm going to write down my assumption as 1685. it's a good idea to walk through the algorithm by yourself and let's run it trip cost missing arguments oh okay so it should really be seven like this i wrote it incorrectly okay 1685 did we get 16.85 boom so you can see that we nailed that one right we got it perfectly but it's important to understand how all of this works together we wrote three separate functions and then at the end we wrote one main function that uses the three helper functions that we wrote and so basically you never have to worry about these three functions you only call this one so your life is easier and other functions figure out their things but one important thing to note is each function does one thing all right we're not make putting everything together in one place where us it's called separation of concerns we're separating out all of our problem solving to different functions and then we put them together at the end and that ultimately returns something something hopefully accurate all right so that was a lot uh hopefully some of that makes made sense and as you can see we did it correctly so we're gonna hit start next lesson hey you never know you can't expect to only spend money on the plane ride hotel rental car when going on a vacation there also needs to be room for additional costs like fancy food or souvenirs so modify your trip cost function definition add a third argument called spending money modify what the trip cost function does add the variable spending money to the sum that it returns okay plus we could be spending a lot of money so that we also have to take that into account so now the trip cost is really dependent on the city the number of days and spending money okay i mean that's how you would literally define it in real life like hey i'm going on a trip i might ask you what do you think the cost is going to be dependent on and you're probably going to say well it depends what city i go to how many days i stay there and how much money i spend that's really what you're telling the computer as well okay so it's pretty natural to describe it i would think save and submit start next lesson plan your trip nah nice work now that you have it all together let's take a trip what if we want to go to los angeles for five days and brought an extra 600 of spending money so that's awesome because we literally just did this right we opened up our idol not that guy idol and we now hold on i'm sorry we opened up our repple.it and we literally did what they are just about to have you do except they put five days instead of los angeles and they added another argument called spending money all right so now they want us to effectively use our functions right call them so i'm going to say trip cost make sure to do print here it's python 2. so i don't need to put parentheses after the print statement i'm going to say los angeles i'm gonna say five and spending money six hundred dollars and then we save and submit and we get 19.55 cool so that was excellent i we went together and we finished this thing right through now we are on the next section okay let's go back to the course page we just finished taking a vacation we are on unit 5 lists and dictionaries great job seriously guys great job for making it this far because i know it gets tough as you go on and it's conceptually harder there's also more work involved but trust me because this is when it starts to get fun and you can start to do powerful things i mean look down you can already do rock paper scissors a student becomes teacher so being able to manage classes write programs i can intelligently figure out who got a b c d so you don't have to do that and much more like make your own games like battleship okay so we are getting into the stuff that will make you help you do really powerful things so don't get discouraged now let's keep playing through it i will see you guys in the next video
