00:00 - - [Narrator] Alight, Mr. Qazi, so Elvis
00:02 - Gonzalvez posted a comment on why
00:05 - most programmers are broke.
00:07 - He said "I got an associates,
took a dive and landed
00:10 - a job. I make more than any
of my friends who decided
00:13 - to continue and take
another two years and will
00:16 - have years of experience
by the time they get out.
00:18 - I know more than they do and can create
00:20 - things practically The best way to
00:22 - learn how to program is
to program. End comment.
00:26 - - Wow, so that is a
really amazing comment,
00:29 - it's really insightful, we got it
00:31 - on one of our videos recently.
00:33 - And basically what he's
saying is that like look,
00:37 - my friends were going to college and I
00:42 - have more practical experience than the
00:45 - friends who actually went to college.
00:47 - Now, what does it actually mean?
00:49 - Does it mean I'm promoting
don't go to college, drop out.
00:55 - Absolutely not, what I
am promoting is that you
00:59 - should try to earn your
way out of college, okay?
01:03 - And, first of all, before I
even go on that conversation,
01:06 - understand and realize what
you're going to college for,
01:10 - for example, if you're
going to college to become
01:12 - a doctor, then it's a requirement for
01:15 - you to actually become a doctor.
01:17 - If you're trying to become a lawyer, it is
01:19 - a requirement for you
to pass your bar exam.
01:22 - Right, otherwise you
can't become a lawyer.
01:24 - For certain things you will need it
01:27 - and there's no other way around it.
01:28 - But if you wanna become a developer,
01:31 - you wanna get a full time job,
01:33 - you wanna work as a web developer,
01:35 - or a full-stack developer,
or a data scientist,
01:37 - it's not so necessary for
you to go to a college.
01:40 - I mean for data science
it's a brand new field.
01:44 - So, there isn't actually
even a lot in colleges
01:47 - that is being taught about it.
01:48 - So most of the material
is outdated in colleges.
01:52 - If you learn on your own, you'll
01:53 - actually learn a lot
better, but you can use
01:57 - resources from college and the teachers
01:59 - from college, or mentors
around you, and then
02:02 - improve the ability,
improve the speed at which
02:05 - you're learning these concepts.
02:06 - Okay? So, one thing I would say is
02:09 - know what you're going to college for.
02:10 - If you're trying to become a developer
02:12 - and all those things I just mentioned,
02:13 - it's not necessary, you
an just use college as one
02:15 - of the resources rather than
college being everything.
02:20 - Okay? So, with that said,
going back to Elvis'
02:23 - comment, he's saying yo,
like I don't need all these,
02:27 - I didn't need all this and
instead of going to college
02:30 - for that long what he instead did is,
02:32 - he got a full time job in that time.
02:36 - So while his friends were
taking four years of college
02:40 - he instead got four years of
actual practical experience.
02:44 - And now he can use that
to go to another job,
02:46 - get paid more, work on
more practical projects,
02:51 - increase his income,
freelance, whatever it is
02:53 - that Elvis needs to do he is able to do.
02:56 - It also doesn't mean
that he stopped learning,
02:58 - he's learning on his own every single day.
03:00 - He's learning at his job every single day.
03:03 - He's being mentored by
the people at his job.
03:05 - And they're mentoring on
things that are actually
03:07 - relevant, not these obfuscated
theoretical concepts.
03:12 - Those are some really important
things to keep in the back
03:15 - of your head when you're
doing all these things
03:17 - like, why am I going to college.
03:18 - Don't feel privileged that you
can just get out of college.
03:21 - So what do I mean by that,
you don't need to wait
03:23 - until you're making a six figure income.
03:24 - But if you are making some money,
03:26 - let's say you are getting
clients, but right now
03:29 - if you are going to
college and you're just
03:31 - complaining that you don't
have enough time, bullshit.
03:34 - Everybody has enough time,
you have enough time,
03:35 - make it work, figure it out, alright.
03:38 - Don't just say I don't have enough time
03:40 - so I'm not gonna ... you
know I think if I drop
03:42 - out of college then I can freelance.
03:45 - Then I can learn how to
code, if you can't figure out
03:47 - how to code right now and
if you can't make time
03:49 - for it right now and
you can't get a client
03:51 - right now, you won't be able to get
03:53 - a client when you have more time.
03:55 - You won't be able to learn coding
03:56 - when you have more time, this is
03:58 - the problem of figuring out how to
03:59 - manage time and how to make it happen.
04:01 - You know I always say
if you can make money
04:04 - with no money, then you can
make a lot of money with money.
04:11 - And this is true, very true,
when it comes to programming.
04:14 - If you can learn how to program when you
04:16 - don't have any time,
then you can learn a lot
04:19 - of how to program when
you do have a lot of time.
04:21 - If you can't freelance and get clients
04:23 - when you have no time,
if you can freelance
04:26 - and get clients and you have limited time,
04:28 - then you can get a lot
of clients and freelance
04:31 - a lot when you have a lot of time.
04:32 - Okay, when you have more time.
04:34 - So, keep these things in mind,
04:37 - don't just drop out of college
04:39 - randomly, thoughtlessly,
earn your way out of it
04:44 - if that's something you're gonna do.
04:45 - Otherwise, you can always use
college as a great resource.
04:48 - College was a great resource for me,
04:49 - but it was a resource,
it wasn't everything.
04:52 - I wasn't dependent on it all the way.
04:54 - Eighty percent of my
education I was doing it
04:56 - through other means, I had mentors, I was
04:59 - going to meet-ups, I
was learning on my own,
05:01 - I was building projects, I
was doing practical stuff.
05:04 - And then I was going to
college and it was just this
05:06 - one extra resource, one teacher who had
05:09 - stuff prepared for me and then I could
05:11 - just come in and learn and commit.
05:13 - Rather than have to figure out all of the
05:14 - material and study by myself.
05:16 - Okay, so if you're use
it, use it as a resource,
05:18 - if you're gonna drop out
earn your way to drop out.
05:21 - Don't just drop out mindlessly.
05:23 - With that said, thank
you so much for watching
05:25 - I love your face and as always,
05:27 - I'll see you in the next
05:31 - video, video, video, peace (rap music).`
