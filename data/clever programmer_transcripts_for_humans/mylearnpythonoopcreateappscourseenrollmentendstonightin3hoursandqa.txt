06:27 - Patrick hi host sir Matt
06:29 - luk I signed up tonight yeah I think I
06:33 - remember your name I think you
06:35 - definitely did sign up tonight whenever
06:37 - you guys sign up it actually calls my
06:39 - phone so if you sign up it'll actually
06:41 - mess up my Facebook live stream which is
06:43 - hilarious but whatever it's
06:46 - cool yeah
06:50 - so this hat was actually given to me by
06:53 - my friend uh and his mom made it for me
06:56 - that was cool his mom has never not been
06:58 - here for like years she finally came to
07:01 - United States I thought that was pretty
07:05 - nice Devin shout out to Devin I remember
07:08 - adding you buddy nice welcome on
07:12 - board James it's definitely not you my
07:15 - friend uh YouTube is very finicky with
07:21 - its audio
07:23 - synchronization I I don't know how
07:25 - Google is such a big company but they
07:27 - haven't figured this out yet it's a
07:29 - little confusing to
07:35 - me okay so tonight in four hours as you
07:39 - can see on my
07:41 - YouTube I think right here I'm going to
07:44 - pretend like I'm looking at it right
07:46 - hold on right
07:48 - there okay my course is ending in four
07:52 - hours okay the registration for that
07:54 - closes so if you guys have any questions
07:57 - about it let me know uh I'd be happy to
08:00 - help and otherwise we're going to kind
08:02 - of chill here for a little bit of a
08:03 - longer time and if you guys just have
08:05 - any questions in general and if I can
08:07 - bring value to your life you know ask me
08:10 - the questions while you have me here so
08:12 - I can answer them for
08:14 - you Antonia says after sign up we should
08:18 - pay
08:18 - $99 well you can't sign up unless you
08:21 - pay $99
08:24 - buddy I love you too Yemen Yemen yav
08:29 - lft WFT what do you mean by course
08:32 - registration what I mean is like should
08:34 - I just say
08:37 - my yeah I
08:40 - mean nobody can enroll in my course okay
08:43 - so I guess my course enrollment ends
08:45 - tonight if that's any easier you know if
08:48 - that makes more sense sure so my python
08:51 - op course essentially takes you from a
08:53 - complete beginner
08:57 - to a coding ninja from a beginner to
09:02 - being able to build apps step by step in
09:04 - less than 7
09:06 - Days and 7 days and is an exaggeration
09:09 - because one of the students his name is
09:10 - David he actually built his apps in two
09:14 - hours so it's kind of cool but yeah it's
09:17 - really like a step-by-step system that
09:19 - takes you there um also you master
09:22 - object-oriented programming why is that
09:24 - important well all of the graphical user
09:27 - interface that you see around you for
09:29 - for example where you are commenting
09:31 - that's a graphical user interface where
09:35 - hi jenica Doma nice to have
09:38 - you that's awesome Bonnie says I want
09:41 - some good python valuable projects to
09:43 - add in my resume Bonnie got to work hard
09:45 - for that takes time takes time takes
09:49 - time and consistent effort systematic
09:51 - methodical approach you'll get there my
09:53 - friend don't
09:54 - worry so yeah anyways I was talking
09:57 - about graphical user interfaces right
09:59 - you comment using them you look at
10:02 - pictures using them you interact with
10:04 - the websites using them you use apps
10:06 - using them right without a graphical
10:08 - user interface you'd be back in
10:10 - 1970s with the Dos command line but that
10:13 - changed cuz we got something called guy
10:15 - which is graphical user interfaces I'm
10:17 - going to take this hat off at this point
10:19 - love this
10:26 - hat all right
10:28 - cool so graphical user interfaces right
10:31 - like it's EV everything around you is
10:34 - basically a graphical user interface so
10:35 - you master that in the course okay and
10:38 - you learn the fundamentals behind it so
10:40 - instead of like you really just I don't
10:43 - know like uh copying code you know on
10:46 - these tutorial websites where you'll
10:48 - just copy all this code and then when
10:52 - the time comes and you're looking at a
10:54 - blank screen your brain is also a blank
10:56 - and you're sitting there scratching
10:57 - yourself does that happen to you guys
10:58 - say yes or no if that happens where you
11:00 - look at a empty screen and you're trying
11:02 - to write code and your brain just kind
11:04 - of goes
11:09 - blank
11:12 - Bruce hello my friend Bruce
11:17 - welcome Bruce welcome welcome
11:26 - everybody how long is the O course
11:29 - great question right now it's about um
11:33 - you know it'll be about even more than
11:36 - 10 plus hours of Premium video content
11:38 - and it's going to constantly getting be
11:41 - getting new videos it's going to
11:42 - constantly be getting new upgrades
11:44 - future bonuses new live sessions um all
11:49 - of that stuff that's going to be added
11:50 - to it is going to be absolutely free of
11:52 - cost to you if you lock it in at the
11:55 - current price but if you miss the
11:57 - tonight's deadline which is in 4 hours
12:01 - on YouTube it's right over here if you
12:04 - miss that my friend you miss it then the
12:07 - next time the course comes it's going to
12:09 - be way more expensive and I'm going to
12:12 - give you a pretty good reason why so
12:14 - I've gone through courses on corsera and
12:16 - also I'm going to spit out these names
12:18 - of these awesome resources if you want
12:19 - to use these free resources write them
12:22 - down okay if you by the way if you have
12:23 - any other tabs open just close them okay
12:25 - just relax put on your headsets
12:29 - get some
12:31 - popcorn get a drink get some water sit
12:34 - in your pajamas and just you know just
12:36 - relax and
12:38 - watch cuz we're going to be in this for
12:40 - the long run uh I'm going to answer all
12:42 - of your questions okay do not worry I'm
12:45 - going to go through um everybody and
12:46 - answer but yeah so all of that content
12:49 - you lock it in at the current price and
12:50 - then you kind of you're able to get
12:53 - it all right so
12:56 - basically you know I've taken course on
12:58 - corser I've taken them on Udacity I've
13:01 - taken taken them on um udem I've taken
13:05 - courses on free code Camp Linda like
13:09 - everything you could imagine like 50
13:11 - different resources okay and then I've
13:13 - also been able to work as a software
13:15 - consultant for many different clients
13:17 - and I've also done lots of personal
13:19 - coaching so this course essentially
13:23 - takes the best out of all of those
13:24 - courses and also you know it has a spin
13:28 - of being able to work as an independent
13:30 - contractor in it which I think is kind
13:32 - of cool cuz my course really focuses
13:35 - also on you getting the return on your
13:37 - investment that you put in the
13:38 - course
13:40 - also for the price of this course there
13:44 - is no other course that has weekly
13:47 - check-ins with you on every Monday
13:49 - that's what I want to be able to do with
13:50 - you guys okay ah somebody just got the
13:53 - course so the Facebook stream went
13:55 - offline I'm going to have to hang up
13:57 - this call one second
14:03 - Facebook stream is back awesome so
14:06 - whenever somebody actually gets the
14:08 - course uh it gives me a call on my phone
14:10 - which is really cool thank you for
14:13 - blessing with Udacity Devan he says yes
14:15 - you're
14:18 - welcome Mario yeah so the course you
14:21 - guys can also get it for $33 per
14:24 - month like that's nothing $33 per month
14:29 - okay for three uh for three months sorry
14:30 - that's it for three Mon it's a
14:31 - three-month payment plan okay I offered
14:33 - that for you guys
14:35 - $33 what is $33 let me break this down
14:38 - to you you go you teach you get one
14:42 - student that you teach a private lesson
14:44 - to generally private lessons you can
14:46 - very easily even as a beginner charge
14:48 - between $50 to $75 an hour or more but
14:51 - let's say you're super hesitant you're
14:53 - not confident in your negotiation skills
14:56 - you're like maybe if I could please
14:58 - teach you blah blah blah right and you
14:59 - land just one student that you can teach
15:02 - which is super easy and I show you how
15:03 - to do that and I'll be showing you
15:05 - consistently throughout our live
15:06 - sessions and the emails I'll send you
15:08 - and all of that let's say you get one
15:11 - student for $20 an hour okay for two
15:15 - hours in a whole month working with that
15:18 - you've made your return on investment
15:21 - plus seven bucks for that
15:24 - month okay and generally when you book a
15:27 - student you know you you have them for a
15:30 - recurring like you know uh one session a
15:32 - week for example so you can be looking
15:34 - at 80 bucks per student if you're doing
15:36 - $20 an hour with one student so I mean
15:38 - even in just the first month with four
15:40 - hours of your time you're getting a
15:42 - return on your investment okay
15:45 - so that is kind of like a
15:48 - no-brainer okay another really cool
15:50 - thing is I'm doing something called
15:52 - Sprint which is something software
15:53 - developers do uh and it's a project
15:55 - management system so we're going to have
15:56 - a Sprint in this session and that's why
15:58 - why I'm uh inviting you guys to this
16:00 - course because I want your help to take
16:02 - it to the next level so it's going to be
16:04 - a 30 to 60-day Long Sprint and
16:06 - essentially how it's going to work
16:08 - is let's say you join right here okay
16:10 - and we have a 30-day Sprint what's going
16:13 - to happen is
16:14 - that every Monday I'm going to check in
16:16 - with you guys so whether it's with
16:18 - surveys or we personally get in touch
16:20 - with you or I personally get in touch
16:22 - with you I'm going to get your feedback
16:24 - and the course is going to be structured
16:26 - around that okay also then when we have
16:29 - our live sessions and our live meetings
16:31 - we'll add those new things in so let's
16:33 - say you guys are saying hey we don't
16:35 - want to do monthly live sessions we want
16:36 - to do like bi-weekly live sessions you
16:39 - got it we'll have that you guys will be
16:41 - like hey I think I want to see this in
16:43 - the course or I want to build this kind
16:44 - of app in your service on the Monday
16:46 - that I check in with you and hold you
16:48 - accountable to your goals you got it
16:50 - we're going to add that to the course so
16:52 - really this course we're going to be
16:54 - developing it together as
16:56 - well there's already a ton of of content
16:59 - in there that'll take you a long time to
17:00 - catch up on but there's going to be new
17:02 - stuff and we're going to be able to
17:03 - build that together right that's pretty
17:06 - exciting like I think that's pretty
17:08 - exciting and contrast that with a coding
17:12 - online boot camp like thanful thinkful
17:14 - charges you not even for that kind of
17:17 - service they charge you $500 a month you
17:20 - know how I know cuz I was in I I've
17:22 - enrolled in
17:24 - thankful
17:26 - uh and also here you get a community of
17:29 - other students so you collaborate with
17:31 - everybody else whether you want to do uh
17:33 - software Consulting work while
17:35 - collaborating with other students you
17:36 - want to do personal projects with them
17:37 - you want to build websites together you
17:39 - can do that right so you're part of that
17:41 - actually live
17:43 - Community
17:45 - um yeah so those other resources right
17:48 - like Udacity is great but it doesn't
17:50 - offer you that personal Community it
17:52 - doesn't offer you that accountability at
17:54 - least not for cheap at the very least
17:56 - it's $200 per month and it still doesn't
17:59 - have live sessions with you okay
18:02 - so this course is only 97 and it has a
18:06 - monthly payment plan as well for three
18:08 - months which you can spread out your
18:11 - payments and it has those sessions which
18:13 - Linda doesn't offer which Udacity
18:15 - doesn't offer which which udemy doesn't
18:18 - offer which code academy doesn't offer
18:20 - so uh it has things which are actually
18:23 - not offered by all these uh other places
18:25 - and you guys get them if you get it you
18:27 - lock get in at the current price and
18:29 - then any new content is yours okay let
18:32 - me take on some more
18:34 - questions
18:39 - um James says if we purchase the program
18:41 - without the slack private group can we
18:44 - add that on later uh
18:50 - James I mean that's not something that I
18:52 - want to be doing all the time because
18:54 - what I want to do is just have all the
18:56 - people in slack at once because when
18:58 - newer people join then the older people
19:00 - who are already there they're like who's
19:01 - this person like they got to you know
19:03 - you're just kind of new to the crew what
19:05 - I want to be able to do is just
19:07 - everybody's kind of like tight and honed
19:09 - in and working together so send me an
19:12 - email James um and if you can email me
19:16 - by tonight and join in tonight then yeah
19:19 - sure we'll add you into the slack group
19:21 - okay but I think after tonight I'm not
19:23 - sure if I'm going to be allowing people
19:25 - to join in separately to the slack group
19:27 - okay it's just I want people to be on
19:30 - the same page I want to you get you I
19:32 - want you to get to know your community
19:33 - around you interact with everybody
19:36 - inside right enjoy and have fun and
19:39 - build things together what will be the
19:41 - cost of the new course simar
19:44 - asks in um on Facebook the cost of the
19:49 - course is
19:51 - $97 AKA two private lessons at $50 an
19:57 - hour and you make your money back AKA
20:01 - one private uh lesson at even 20 bucks
20:03 - an hour and in 5 hours you get your
20:06 - money back okay so I love the idea of
20:09 - getting return on my investment for
20:11 - example I bought this crazy course right
20:14 - um it's called ztl uh you know it's
20:18 - called yeah zero to launch okay it's
20:20 - about business and it was a $4,000
20:22 - course so the whole time I'm like okay
20:25 - all of these skills I'm learning from it
20:27 - how can I use it to get a return on my
20:29 - investment because these things are an
20:31 - investment right you're taking that
20:32 - initiative to invest in yourself you're
20:34 - saying okay I'm going to take this step
20:37 - I'm going to take this decision to
20:38 - improve my knowledge to make a
20:40 - commitment and to actually move forward
20:42 - like for example when I would take a
20:44 - corsera course I could have taken it for
20:46 - free and then paid for the certification
20:49 - but anytime I took anything for free I
20:51 - never made the commitment and I did not
20:53 - stick with it sure there were a few
20:56 - courses which I took for free and stuck
20:57 - with them like uh I think Udacity enter
20:59 - the computer science and whatever but
21:02 - when I paid for a course for corser I
21:04 - was like holy crap like I've paid for it
21:06 - I better stick with it so it's just that
21:08 - one more boost that helped me stick
21:10 - through it okay for you guys it might be
21:12 - a different boost right maybe you you
21:14 - can do something else to hold yourself
21:16 - accountable or have your friends hold
21:18 - you accountable for taking actions but
21:21 - it's just important to make a decision
21:23 - and then take action right like just
21:26 - Dilly dallying and being lazy and taking
21:28 - time procrastinating is a dangerous
21:30 - place to be wi says should I still do
21:33 - intro to programming Udacity win
21:37 - 30034 if you are at my course in Learn
21:40 - Python oop sure you can supplement
21:42 - Udacity great if you want to do that
21:45 - supplement your knowledge you have extra
21:46 - time totally cool
21:49 - awesome all right take on more questions
21:53 - should I learn Java or python to be an
21:55 - app developer python I think it's the
21:58 - world's greatest language people will
22:00 - disagree but that's what I think and
22:02 - here's why I've said this multiple times
22:06 - but one onethird of Google was written
22:09 - in Python okay so like one of the major
22:12 - languages involved in Google is python
22:15 - Instagram with 450 million people in
22:18 - growing platform written in Python
22:20 - Pinterest written in Python okay I've
22:21 - mentioned this multiple times already
22:23 - YouTube is actually a lot of it is
22:25 - written in Python so python you can use
22:29 - at a very like basic level to make like
22:32 - cartoon games to working in NASA doing
22:35 - big data analytics handling pedabytes of
22:38 - data okay or doing machine learning
22:42 - algorithms at Amazon which recommend to
22:46 - you stuff that you couldn't even think
22:48 - about in your own head you're like how
22:50 - does Amazon know me so well or how does
22:52 - Netflix know me so well I didn't even
22:54 - think of this and they're suggesting
22:56 - this to me right so python general
22:59 - purpose language but a very strong
23:02 - language and what I love about it is you
23:03 - could be a 10-year-old or a 9-year-old
23:06 - and understand it it reads so smoothly
23:09 - and easily and then you could also um
23:14 - take it to the next level and work at
23:16 - you know NASA or somewhere very complex
23:19 - like one of my friends actually works at
23:21 - Google his name is Ben marks I'm uh
23:23 - probably going to do a live interview
23:25 - with him uh for you guys so we can
23:27 - record it talk so that that would be
23:29 - really cool but yeah I mean python it's
23:32 - an all-purpose
23:35 - language what qualifications does one
23:38 - need to become a freelance
23:40 - contractor you don't need qualifications
23:43 - I I I see people saying that a lot and
23:45 - especially now that I run my entire
23:47 - business I rarely hire people that have
23:50 - um like cred like I don't care about
23:53 - credentials yes credentials matter but
23:55 - what matters more is what you can
23:56 - actually do right
23:59 - if I'm hiring
24:01 - you I want to look at your
24:04 - um like I I want to see what kind of
24:07 - return on my investment you can bring me
24:09 - I don't care about how cool your
24:12 - algorithms are I care about what kind of
24:14 - applications have you built and if it's
24:16 - in line with what I want and I can see a
24:18 - return on my investment I want to hire
24:20 - you it's a no-brainer for me okay so
24:23 - that's one of the things I emphasize in
24:25 - my course is that we build real
24:29 - applications okay we just had another
24:31 - person join super
24:35 - cool um I might actually call out your
24:37 - guys's names so what I'm going to do is
24:41 - how do I do this I do I open up my Gmail
24:44 - or
24:46 - something
24:48 - yeah all right so I'll try to call out
24:51 - your name and if it's you um
24:55 - cool that's really cool actually
25:02 - here's what I'll do anybody who joins in
25:05 - this YouTube session just send a little
25:08 - comment to uh you know kiat Clover
25:12 - program.com or just say it in our slack
25:15 - Channel or wherever you can reach me you
25:17 - know just
25:19 - say uh once you get the course just say
25:22 - I I I was in your YouTube Stream So when
25:24 - I have that one-on-one Master call with
25:26 - you oh by the way I also give you a
25:27 - one-on-one Master
25:29 - call how cool is that Master call where
25:32 - we actually discuss your strategy for
25:34 - the next 3 months of what you're going
25:36 - to be doing so you spend 15 minutes with
25:39 - me and we figure out what we're what
25:41 - you're going to be doing for the next
25:42 - three
25:44 - months like that's powerful right that's
25:46 - value you get some crazy value if I
25:48 - could if you could figure out your plan
25:50 - for the next three months I mean that's
25:52 - awesome that's part of the
25:56 - course
25:58 - and if you join and you say something
26:00 - about you were in this YouTube
26:02 - stream uh you know I'll I'll probably
26:05 - throw in like extra 10 minutes for you
26:06 - guys okay so I want to give you guys a
26:09 - little bonus for being here for being
26:11 - the action takers that you are love
26:17 - it hey Sam I got Facebook Facebook is
26:21 - baby compared to the YouTube like we got
26:24 - 52 people on YouTube and we got five
26:26 - people on Facebook
26:28 - Sager
26:30 - hi all
26:35 - right Rahul says can we use debit card
26:38 - for payments
26:39 - Rahul yes you can just select the PayPal
26:43 - option if you select the other option
26:45 - which
26:46 - is um that other option is only for
26:49 - credit cards so there's a button when
26:51 - you go to the page says PayPal you can
26:53 - just pay with PayPal PayPal handles
26:55 - debit card credit card PayPal whatever
26:58 - else okay you can also go the
26:59 - three-month payment route whichever one
27:01 - you prefer but uh the one of the most
27:06 - exciting things about this course is
27:07 - like being able to get that slack
27:09 - Channel like I would have killed for a
27:12 - community like that because let me give
27:14 - you a little bit of background like what
27:15 - had what has helped me learn at
27:17 - literally 10 times the rate of other
27:20 - people around me where I was able to
27:21 - charge more like two to three times more
27:25 - than even my mentors who have been uh
27:28 - doing software consultant work for like
27:31 - 20 years okay one thing that has helped
27:34 - me is being able to connect with really
27:36 - smart people okay um my number one skill
27:39 - okay is being teachable I'm not like
27:42 - intelligent or whatever like I'm not
27:44 - there's nothing that special about me
27:46 - okay um I'm a bad student in school I
27:49 - was terrible at math but I got pretty
27:51 - damn good at programming and the reason
27:53 - is one I developed a passion for it and
27:55 - just loved it so I was able to get
27:56 - through everything ever because it was
28:00 - just fun for me right isn't there
28:02 - something you love so much that you can
28:04 - have pain or hardship or obstacles and
28:07 - you just overcome it because you just
28:09 - love it so that's really what was going
28:11 - on with me and I was able to go on like
28:14 - meetup.com and I got super lucky because
28:17 - so many people try to network and they
28:19 - like meet random people and nothing just
28:21 - connects for them for me I was
28:23 - connecting and I ended up finding my
28:25 - mentor his name was Nick oh my God like
28:27 - he helped me accelerate like years
28:30 - Beyond years Beyond um in a very short
28:34 - amount of time and he would give me
28:35 - these personalized tasks and like this
28:37 - laser focused stuff to do and I would
28:39 - literally get good like this that was
28:42 - awesome uh Omar Pasha just joined Zang
28:45 - Zang just joined Kevin Navar just joined
28:48 - Ahmed karesi just
28:52 - joined I think I think it might be safe
28:54 - to say it's pretty lit up in here
28:59 - um awesome excited to have you guys okay
29:03 - so as I was saying what was I
29:07 - saying mentors uh yes so for me that has
29:11 - helped me a lot and then just being able
29:13 - to collaborate with like-minded students
29:15 - I used to go to this place called PS1 it
29:16 - was a co-working space so I think I got
29:20 - a membership I can't remember I think it
29:22 - was $150 a month and essentially you go
29:25 - there and you just cowork so I just
29:27 - wanted to find like-minded people there
29:29 - it was very difficult I found like maybe
29:31 - one or two people and it helped a lot
29:33 - because they were where I was and then
29:35 - they wanted to go where I wanted to go
29:37 - so it really helped us focus and work
29:40 - together and then my mentor would come
29:41 - in once in a while and then give me that
29:43 - boost and accelerate my skill set
29:46 - unbelievable okay so again something I
29:48 - was paying I think $150 something like
29:50 - that per
29:51 - month and for you guys if you join the
29:54 - slack Channel if you join the course and
29:56 - you join the slack Channel which is
29:59 - $47 we have a 100 plus students in the
30:02 - slack Channel like focused dedicated who
30:06 - want to take their career to the next
30:08 - level collaborate with them okay if you
30:11 - do decide to join
30:13 - okay please don't be one of those people
30:15 - who's just going to like sit there and
30:17 - do nothing take advantage of that use
30:19 - everybody around you like use them so
30:22 - you guys can do stuff together you can
30:24 - start your own app together you can
30:26 - build a website together you can like
30:28 - everybody want everybody who's in here
30:31 - wants to be doing something and if you
30:33 - can hold each other accountable and move
30:35 - forward I mean I personally think that's
30:37 - incredibly exciting I don't know about
30:39 - you
30:40 - guys all right
30:45 - um cs50 is Amazing Alex I'm uh cs50 is
30:50 - really cool I absolutely love it yes
30:53 - it's a good course it's for C uh but
30:55 - again the live community that slack
30:58 - channel is not there forums are there
31:00 - and forums are like I just hate them
31:03 - because you'll type in something and
31:04 - then you have to wait like days or
31:06 - something to get an answer and you can't
31:08 - really connect with people this is very
31:10 - different because you can you can just
31:11 - communicate with everybody you can like
31:14 - you can just text message me
31:16 - instantly right you can reach me
31:18 - instantly you can't do that at cs50 you
31:21 - can't reach that guy who's doing cs50
31:23 - okay uh and then once in a while like
31:26 - I'm very asked with my responses so I'll
31:28 - even like send you personalized V videos
31:30 - to answer your questions okay if I'm
31:32 - feeling if I'm in the mood otherwise
31:34 - I'll answer your questions through
31:35 - message really quickly all right cool we
31:38 - had another person joined Nicholas
31:46 - Cardona all right thank you Rachel for
31:48 - posting the PayPal Link in the Facebook
31:50 - Chat super cool we love
31:56 - Rachel if you guys want to make uh
31:59 - Rachel's life very miserable is like
32:02 - just enroll in the course and then
32:05 - she'll have she'll have to do so much
32:07 - work to enroll all you guys in
32:12 - manually Stephanie Lynn Chandler says it
32:15 - is hard to get off your site
32:18 - sometime uh didn't think I'd get into it
32:21 - so
32:23 - much programming is a world of its own
32:27 - it's beautiful it's
32:29 - magnificent when I'm programming I'm
32:32 - literally in My Own Zone like I wish I
32:35 - could have you here with me right now
32:38 - like what is
32:41 - this like I get my coffee okay I put my
32:44 - coffee down I'll like be sipping
32:47 - slurping on my coffee I'll be like
32:49 - writing my code I'll have my headsets in
32:52 - I like don't want any distractions so
32:54 - generally I would go work at night
32:57 - and uh so that way I don't have any
32:59 - distractions I could just focus and
33:01 - learn and I was logging in crazy days
33:03 - I'm talking 10 15 20 hour days that was
33:06 - also another one of my reasons to
33:08 - accelerate so fast and I just want to be
33:10 - clear guys when you get into this
33:13 - course I'm going to be doing everything
33:15 - I can to help boost you and to hold you
33:19 - accountable okay everybody else in the
33:20 - community is very driven but your
33:23 - success is your responsibility okay so I
33:26 - don't want people who who are like I'm
33:29 - look they're looking for some kind of
33:30 - magic bullet or they're looking for some
33:32 - kind of instant solution to their
33:34 - problem without any effort okay expect
33:36 - hard work expect to put in work ex
33:39 - expect to be involved okay like those
33:42 - things are actually your
33:43 - responsibilities they're not my
33:45 - responsibility they're not somebody
33:46 - else's responsibilities we will be there
33:49 - for you I will be there for you we're
33:51 - going to be in the slack Whatever
33:53 - Whenever you guys communicate we'll get
33:55 - back to you you know we'll constantly be
33:57 - adding new things to this course but you
34:01 - have to go through it right I don't want
34:03 - it to be one of those where you throw it
34:05 - in you know your trophy cabinet or
34:07 - whatever and then you just like don't do
34:09 - anything with it I do that on em me I'll
34:13 - go and just like buy like 20 different
34:15 - courses and just not even watch any of
34:17 - them so this course's whole job is to
34:19 - not be one of those because there's
34:21 - going to be constant involvement I'm
34:22 - going to send you personalized emails
34:25 - where I'm going to have special videos
34:27 - for people who join these are exclusive
34:29 - videos for nobody else outside okay I'm
34:32 - going to have special tricks and tricks
34:34 - and strategies for you guys whether it's
34:35 - for software Consulting negotiation
34:37 - skills tactics you know scripts for
34:40 - example for for some of you guys who
34:43 - joined the
34:47 - webinar who joined the webinar uh I said
34:50 - I'm going to share with you if you buy
34:51 - my course in that time I was going to
34:52 - share with you my
34:54 - $20,000 Craigslist ad a a post that I
34:58 - made that generated me TW over $20,000
35:01 - in two months okay and let me tell you
35:04 - about these two months it was May and
35:05 - June of last year and I visited
35:07 - California I worked remotely I was with
35:10 - my brother we went to mount Baldi Had
35:12 - the Time of Our Lives went on a freaking
35:14 - ski lift and that was really cool it was
35:16 - like snowing I think it was like May and
35:18 - June and on the top of the mountain when
35:20 - we went there it was like snowing so
35:22 - super cool like literally cool like
35:25 - Frozen um no I I meant it like just cool
35:29 - and then I just did a word play and that
35:33 - was an unbelievable experience like I
35:35 - had a lot of fun and then I went to see
35:37 - my nephew and the only reason I was able
35:40 - to do all those things was cuz I had a
35:42 - job where I had clients I was on I was
35:44 - My Own Boss You Could Be Your Own Boss
35:46 - if you have your multiple clients right
35:47 - treat yourself as a
35:49 - business don't think of your employers
35:52 - as employees or employers think of them
35:54 - as uh clients right so you have multiple
35:57 - of those and now you're not reliant on
35:59 - anybody for me the idea of a 9 to-5 job
36:02 - is not safe at all like that's just one
36:04 - job but you have 20 clients you're safe
36:07 - if one goes away you don't care you have
36:09 - 19 you can get another one more right
36:11 - you care about
36:13 - them but the beauty is that you get to
36:17 - focus on like not only do they get to be
36:21 - selective about you but you also get to
36:22 - be selective about them so imagine a
36:25 - life where you get to pick your own
36:27 - clients where you get to travel on your
36:30 - own right on your own command at any
36:32 - time for you guys what is it mean for
36:35 - you guys what would it mean to be
36:38 - financially like
36:40 - free right what would you guys do with
36:48 - that Ivo Ivanov I'm going to answer your
36:51 - courses and clever programmer are one of
36:53 - the few understandable for beginners
36:55 - thank you KY great work you are very
36:57 - welcome I'm glad you said that I'm going
36:59 - to answer I'm going to now look at some
37:01 - more unbiased questions Zane mik how
37:04 - long ago did you start study
37:06 - python Patrick says Patrick called me
37:09 - Zay mik that is a compliment Patrick I
37:12 - will take that compliment and I will
37:14 - wear my hat it's Hat Time
37:21 - guys all right 3 hours and 46 minutes
37:25 - remaining oh and best of all here this
37:28 - is a m mic drop moment so I'm going to
37:30 - not going to drop my keys I'm just going
37:31 - to drop my wallet so here mic drop
37:33 - moment okay you guys ready if you guys
37:36 - are ready let me know in the
37:40 - comments the course starts immediately

37:45 - immediately like the course content is
37:47 - already there we're only going to get
37:48 - new
37:49 - content yes you can still sign up cunder
37:53 - says I don't have any experience in
37:54 - programming should I still sign up yes
37:57 - uh if you want to of course like read
37:59 - about it you know don't just join cuz
38:01 - I'm saying it like do your own research
38:03 - but once you
38:07 - join and if you're on the border line
38:09 - and you're like I want to join but I
38:10 - want to join later well here let me give
38:12 - you a
38:13 - no-brainer the price is going to go up
38:17 - okay like it I know this course's value
38:20 - is way higher than
38:22 - $97 but because like all of you guys get
38:24 - to come in right now and we get more
38:26 - people and we kind of like build this
38:28 - course and make it even better together
38:31 - like that is exciting to me that is that
38:33 - should be exciting for you guys as well
38:36 - but later on the price of this course is
38:38 - going to go higher so if you're kind of
38:40 - on the fence I would suggest looking
38:41 - into it now so you're not paying a
38:43 - higher price now another no-brainer for
38:45 - you guys okay 30-day moneybag guarantee
38:49 - um here my my money back is a my money

39:54 - you Hwang says says how do you delete
39:57 - that comment that you just post H kuang
39:59 - I wouldn't be deleting comments I
40:01 - wouldn't be posting comments that I want
40:03 - to
40:06 - [Laughter]
40:09 - delete J di says sha please say please
40:13 - say or JD sha says please say hi hi Hi
40:16 - how are you
40:17 - doing sham says if I get a certification
40:20 - from Harvard on etex is it as valuable
40:22 - or not I mean that will it give me a
40:23 - return on my investment your return on
40:26 - invest M does not and I repeat does not
40:30 - come from
40:31 - you passively learning collecting
40:35 - certifications and doing nothing about
40:37 - them you know how I know because I have
40:40 - like all the certifications on Cera and
40:42 - eics and free Cod camp and all of that
40:44 - stuff okay your return on investment
40:48 - comes to you when you get your ass out
40:50 - of your chair and hustle and find work
40:56 - that's really what it is and I will show
40:59 - you that and I will teach you
41:00 - that but that's really where it comes
41:03 - from okay yes your skills will always
41:06 - matter but one of the biggest mistakes I
41:10 - see people making especially in the
41:12 - engineering world they're
41:17 - like our skills are so good that we're
41:20 - not going to go out and uh help anybody
41:23 - we're just going to expect everybody to
41:25 - come to us okay okay we're just going to
41:27 - let everybody flock to us big mistake my
41:31 - friend yange she says Mr mull please
41:35 - give yangi a shout out so Yang yangi uh
41:39 - she was actually on the webinar today I
41:41 - don't know if you guys remember that she
41:43 - came uh when everything went to chaos
41:46 - that was kind of exciting I have fun
41:48 - when there's chaos and she
41:51 - absolutely uh you know killed it what
41:53 - she did is she watched one of our free
41:55 - videos at clever programmer okay
41:57 - literally free video It's called four
42:00 - ways to make more money starting today
42:02 - and you know what she did that was
42:04 - different than 99.5% of the people want
42:07 - to take a
42:08 - guess
42:10 - she took
42:15 - action it's as simple as that sometimes
42:18 - she decided to take action and follow
42:20 - through instead of passively watch
42:22 - because you know like I told her 99.5%
42:25 - of the people you can give them all the
42:27 - advice in the world they'll just sit
42:29 - there and take it and just be like yeah
42:30 - yeah that makes sense I knew that yeah
42:33 - okay the I knew it syndrome I hate it
42:37 - with my
42:38 - guts people who say I knew
42:42 - it I hate that word like if you if you
42:45 - could take my number one skill from me
42:47 - and steal it okay you know what it would
42:49 - be it would not be um intelligence or
42:53 - math Wizardry because that's not
42:54 - required for programming but you know
42:56 - what it would
42:59 - be would be my skill to be teachable
43:03 - like literally I can I can be a sponge I
43:06 - just shut up listen and
43:08 - learn Stephanie says that's the worst
43:10 - yep I agree Stephanie that's the worst
43:12 - the I knew it
43:14 - syndrome like these people just like ah
43:16 - yeah I knew it sometimes even if you
43:18 - know just shut up and don't say anything
43:20 - you'll and really let those words sink
43:22 - in you'll be surprised the effect they
43:24 - have on you Devin says you Bulls fan I
43:26 - don't watch so I don't watch
43:31 - basketball I watch soccer I love soccer
43:34 - I play
43:36 - soccer yeah the Samba Soccer oh that's
43:40 - hilarious his name is the Samba Soccer
43:42 - whose question I'm about to go to how
43:43 - much will the price go up I want to
43:45 - learn code and I want to be a part of
43:46 - what you're doing but I only have had
43:48 - two days to think about spending $97
43:50 - Samba Soccer let me make it really easy
43:52 - for you yes you have two days to think
43:54 - about well
43:56 - well you actually have I think if you
43:59 - look at the time right here you actually
44:01 - only have three hours left to think
44:02 - about it but here let me make it very
44:04 - simple in 30 days if you don't like it
44:07 - you refund okay so you get to you get to
44:12 - kind of try it out and learn those
44:14 - things okay and and see if it's right
44:15 - for you but I totally get it you're like
44:18 - I don't know if I should make this
44:19 - investment or not and you're not ready
44:22 - sometimes you're not ready to pull the
44:24 - trigger that's okay
44:26 - um I'll still be here 99% of my material
44:31 - is free still gives you amazing results
44:33 - like for example I got distracted by
44:35 - Yang she watched one of the videos took
44:38 - action and went in one day or in three
44:41 - days 72 hours from having $13 an hour
44:45 - job to having multiple 50 plus an hour
44:51 - clients $13 an hour here to $50 an hour
44:59 - with multiple
45:01 - clients in 72
45:04 - hours my hand is not even in the screens
45:07 - anymore that's how much of a that's the
45:09 - Boost that she got okay and you know
45:13 - yeah so apply yourself her return on the
45:17 - investment of watching a free video at
45:19 - clever programmer this month is going to
45:21 - be
45:21 - $800 just this month extra just extra
45:24 - income okay extra income she's only
45:27 - working like just a few hours extra and
45:29 - what's her work she's going to be like
45:30 - doing table tennis lessons or something
45:32 - fun okay and even if it's a chemistry
45:34 - lesson or whatever but she applied those
45:37 - strategies and she landed you know
45:40 - multiple clients so that return on the
45:42 - investment I mean what is that how do I
45:44 - say that Infinity right I mean my
45:47 - calculus isn't the strongest but I have
45:49 - taken Cal 1 2 3 and differential
45:51 - equations and advanced mathematics which
45:55 - I don't use any day the the biggest
45:57 - thing I use is algebra
45:59 - nowadays they tell you you're going to
46:00 - use math but you really don't and then
46:02 - you just use libraries I use libraries
46:05 - and I teach PhD
46:07 - students I have Master students who I'm
46:10 - helping and able to teach why cuz I love
46:13 - programming and you can too like I'm
46:15 - just telling you this not to brag but to
46:17 - literally tell you that there is nothing
46:20 - special about me okay and you can get
46:23 - these same results you can get even
46:25 - better results by just being persistent
46:27 - okay how I became top 1% in the world
46:30 - for chess was here's the hack I replaced
46:34 - Netflix with
46:36 - tutorials ultimate
46:39 - hack Netflix with
46:43 - tutorials music car driving commuting
46:47 - time music with
46:52 - audible cunder says I am signed up
46:55 - thanks kazzy cunder did you sign can I
46:58 - get your Craigslist stuff cunder when
47:00 - did you join if you join
47:04 - now if you join now you don't get the
47:06 - Craigslist stuff you you get it in the
47:13 - webinar Stephanie asks how much do you
47:15 - suggest you charge uh for your first
47:18 - client
47:20 - Yang Yang is on point she just started
47:23 - audible she is like increasing her
47:26 - income like exponentially I love it
47:29 - Stephanie good question let me answer
47:30 - that right now okay for you
47:33 - so for your first
47:36 - client I'm kind of crazy I'm really
47:38 - aggressive with my Approach but
47:45 - like if you're if you're like if you're
47:48 - medium comfortable with what you're
47:50 - teaching and you're like teaching
47:51 - somebody who's one step behind you you
47:53 - can start off at $50 an hour
47:57 - okay um that's kind of like an expected
48:00 - rate if you want to play it safe go
48:03 - maybe 35 or 40 but don't disrespect
48:05 - yourself okay understand your value and
48:08 - if you're helping somebody solve their
48:10 - problem then it doesn't matter what what
48:13 - you're charging okay I know some of us
48:16 - have that pain and it hurts to charge
48:18 - more but my biggest thing that I tell
48:20 - people is charge uncomfortably High when
48:23 - it makes you uncomfortable that's
48:26 - you're charging the right price okay
48:28 - that's really what it
48:39 - is what Udi courses did you enroll into
48:42 - Billy nir asks me oh my God man I
48:45 - enrolled in some like programming
48:47 - courses for like python long time ago um
48:50 - oh my God and they're
48:53 - so I don't want to say they're bad but
48:55 - they're like bad because uh they're made
48:59 - by a software developer who like didn't
49:01 - make them with love wanted to make money
49:03 - and just like went and just shot it in
49:05 - like one ghost boring screencast they
49:08 - don't try to like make it exciting
49:09 - Udacity makes it exciting they have a
49:12 - production budget like their V their
49:14 - video quality is High I mean so it's
49:16 - cool and it's nice to watch them but
49:19 - udem is like
49:22 - [Music]
49:24 - G
49:30 - yeah so I have I have some reading
49:32 - courses I learned about Bitcoin from you
49:34 - to me and uh I think I made like $99,000
49:38 - in like a few months doing Bitcoin stuff
49:40 - I really got into it so I you know I had
49:43 - my family like invest in it when I was
49:45 - younger I was like 16 and I started like
49:47 - learning about it and then you know we
49:50 - made trades it was so freaking
49:53 - scary um it was literally so scary doing
49:57 - stuff with
49:59 - um uh with Bitcoin and like getting my
50:02 - family involved cuz I was young and I
50:04 - didn't really have that much income and
50:05 - I got my family to invest like 15 or
50:10 - $20,000 and I was like handling
50:12 - everybody's money and I was like putting
50:13 - it in a certain exchange I picked it up
50:16 - from udem me and literally all I did was
50:17 - replace Netflix with uh you to me so
50:20 - like it didn't affect my social life it
50:22 - didn't affect like I still got to go out
50:23 - I still got to have fun still got to
50:25 - meet with my friends like that's what
50:27 - I'm talking about these are really
50:28 - simple hacks you can apply um and just
50:31 - really take it to the next
50:33 - level can I pay for the course in
50:35 - Bitcoin steam do says no you can't I'm
50:38 - sorry I wish I used to do that a lot but
50:40 - I stopped doing stuff with
50:43 - Bitcoin how long have you been mining oh
50:47 - you ask somebody I I used to do Bitcoin
50:50 - mining as well that was really cool like
50:52 - I had my laptop sitting there and it was
50:54 - generating money I thought that was was
50:55 - crazy I was like what is
50:58 - this
50:59 - [Music]
51:00 - um yeah and then like really crazy stuff
51:03 - happened it was really intense it's a
51:04 - long story I'm not going to go into it
51:06 - but um my heart was beating like crazy
51:10 - especially the last few days but I got
51:12 - out on the profitable end if my family
51:15 - actually didn't freak out the Bitcoin
51:18 - actually went down to $200 and they got
51:20 - scared and they wanted to leave and I
51:22 - told them don't and if they didn't they
51:24 - took that loss and they wrote it out
51:26 - right now it's at $1,200 or $1,000 or
51:28 - something I'm pretty sure so that's 5x
51:32 - so them investing
51:35 - $115,000 we would have been sitting at
51:37 - what
51:39 - $75,000 right
51:42 - so sometimes it's like you know you got
51:44 - to write it out a little
51:46 - bit Alexander Sanchez
51:49 - Mustafa Mustafa is my
51:52 - brother uh he's the reason why I started
51:55 - my YouTu YouTube channel um he gave me
51:58 - huge motivation so I am humbled that
52:02 - Mustafa you're here and in my channel
52:05 - this guy's crazy he has two YouTube
52:07 - channels with like 20,000
52:09 - subscribers and it's unbelievable and
52:12 - just thank you for helping me start
52:15 - mine Alexander can I pay for the course
52:17 - yes you can pay for the course now my
52:18 - friend uh 3 hours left 3 hours and 31
52:22 - minutes you can pay for it now the
52:24 - deadline will be up in 3 hours and 31
52:26 - minutes and no I won't be sneaking in
52:28 - anybody through the back door I mean
52:29 - when it's done it's done like you just
52:32 - miss the deadline like if you woke up
52:34 - five minutes late and missed it you just
52:36 - missed it that's that's just all it is
52:39 - because that otherwise I'd be be unfair
52:41 - to 10,000 students enrolled in clever
52:46 - programmer um what libraries and
52:48 - Frameworks are using so again my whole
52:51 - idea is not to be one of those udemy
52:53 - courses that just like that person is
52:56 - already a software developer with 20
52:58 - years of experience so he just like goes
53:00 - through the entire course doesn't care
53:01 - about you and what happens is you follow
53:05 - him and you copy his code and you feel
53:06 - like a big boy or a big
53:10 - girl and then you sit and stare at a
53:13 - blank screen you're just like scratching
53:14 - your head and you're like what the hell
53:16 - is this like I can't even write one line
53:19 - of code uh but then you like try to
53:22 - impress your friends and say hey look
53:24 - what I made which you make you followed
53:26 - and you just like yeah so I stay away
53:29 - from that okay Frameworks and all that
53:32 - stuff you'll learn them they're super
53:33 - easy but I gave you fundamentals so
53:36 - you're ready to BR build all of this
53:38 - stuff on your own that's really what I
53:40 - want to focus on I don't want to focus
53:41 - on other things We'll add the other
53:44 - things okay don't worry about them Aaron
53:46 - cut back cuu back joined just a little
53:50 - bit
53:51 - ago let's see Devon Mitchell no
53:55 - Elena Lazarus joined great
54:02 - cool yeah guys we're manually enrolling
54:05 - everybody because what I said is so you
54:07 - see how on Clever
54:09 - program.com o another person is joining
54:12 - I'm gonna call him out sikander Khan
54:14 - just joined welcome buddy I just got you
54:18 - he just joined from Facebook I got
54:20 - Facebook going I got YouTube going it's
54:22 - crazy it's lit up in here so keep
54:26 - here okay anyways let me let me answer
54:29 - some qu Yeah so basically what we're
54:31 - trying to do is um if you join any
54:34 - clever program.com course it
54:36 - automatically enrolls you right you're
54:37 - in this course once you pay for it we
54:41 - enroll you uh we enroll you manually so
54:44 - don't like freak out like we'll enroll
54:46 - you just in a little bit I personally
54:48 - want to enroll as many people as I can
54:50 - it helps me learn everybody's names I'm
54:52 - kind of weird in that sense I'm kind of
54:54 - crazy about that so I want to get to
54:56 - know everybody and I want my team to get
54:58 - to know everybody while they're
54:59 - enrolling you so yeah it might take an
55:01 - extra second but I just think it's
55:03 - really freaking cool cuz then
55:04 - everybody's on board and we all kind of
55:06 - know each other including the team at
55:08 - clever programmer like I just I don't
55:10 - think many people do that and they
55:12 - really get to know you guys and I feel
55:14 - like we get to know you guys and it's
55:15 - cool and then it's really funny also cuz
55:19 - then Rachel is like screaming and she's
55:20 - like oh my God so many people are
55:22 - joining and I can't keep up and I can't
55:24 - enroll every everybody so I I mean it's
55:27 - just kind of funny and I think
55:30 - um uh you guys you
55:33 - know you guys should do that make her
55:35 - life
55:37 - miserable all right greatest ever python
55:40 - instructor I read automate you're boring
55:43 - Stu with python for another programmer
55:44 - but just a fancy title No reality unlike
55:46 - your videos are great
55:49 - dbf another person just joined
55:53 - nice Timothy
55:57 - Samson where is
55:59 - Timothy
56:05 - Timothy all right Timothy where are
56:08 - you I don't see Timothy anywhere oh
56:11 - maybe he's not in here yeah code academy
56:14 - it's
56:16 - like I don't know it just makes me roll
56:18 - my eyes there's a reason why my free
56:22 - code academy course is number one and
56:25 - and here's why it's because
56:28 - um I'm really weird with how I learn woo
56:32 - another
56:34 - join I you guys are you guys are really
56:37 - cool you guys are just a bunch of cool
56:40 - people you guys are just a bunch of cool
56:43 - people uh let me finish my goddamn
56:46 - sentence I'm sorry but I'm G to finish
56:48 - my
56:50 - sentence all
56:52 - right um code academy was what they do
56:55 - well I'm not a huge okay so here's why
56:57 - my course is really doing really good
56:59 - it's really killing it it's because of
57:00 - how I learn and how I think
57:06 - so I'm like really slow to learn
57:10 - something but then the longer I spend in
57:12 - it I learn it really fast so a lot of
57:15 - you guys are really amazing like you
57:19 - guys have no idea but a lot of you guys
57:20 - might not give yourself credit but a lot
57:22 - of you guys can actually learn things
57:23 - faster than I can like you and I will
57:26 - sit down and you'll read a little bit of
57:27 - the book and you'll know it like right
57:30 - away or like you'll remember that part
57:33 - and for me I it won't even like register
57:35 - with me for a long time like it'll take
57:37 - me 5 hours but then the longer time I
57:40 - spend with it the better I get which is
57:43 - why I kind of got killed in school uh in
57:46 - a lot of places cuz it was hard for me
57:48 - to like I'm not I'm not slow I'm fast
57:52 - but like you know there's certain things
57:53 - like chemistry Labs or what whatever I
57:55 - just I'm like not sure what's going
57:57 - on but then I'd spend eight hours of my
58:00 - own time because I'd get so passionate
58:02 - and then I'd have this Insight that
58:03 - nobody else has so that was another kind
58:07 - of part of it and that really helps me
58:09 - another person just joined Sammy Bai
58:12 - welcome so yeah that's kind of what
58:14 - happens you know like um that helps me
58:16 - build my code academy course or all my
58:18 - courses and then what's great is when
58:20 - you guys are learning I just feel like
58:23 - since I'm so slow in learning
58:25 - I ask all the questions you might not
58:27 - even ask so that's why they're so step
58:29 - by step and that's why you can learn all
58:31 - of that stuff so well taking those
58:33 - courses that I'm making so it's like my
58:36 - weird way of thinking actually helps you
58:43 - guys Timothy nice Tim sson says I'm here
58:47 - he's Timothy Samson he just joined uh
58:50 - Sammy Bai just joined again 3 hours 25
58:54 - minutes to go guys cool good

59:36 - have been looking for just joined
59:40 - Tyler my
59:43 - friend that is what it's about okay
59:45 - sometimes you got to go I'm about to

59:55 - out you can Retreat right like have some
59:58 - options in the back of your head that
59:59 - where you can Retreat right the 30 money
60:01 - 30-day money back guarantee just go like
60:04 - I'm going to go hard for 29 days and if
60:07 - it doesn't pan
60:08 - out yeah I'll I'll I'll I'll return it
60:12 - okay but don't just rely on that fall

60:30 - initiative and you know and get inside
60:32 - the course because we're excited to have
60:34 - you man we're
60:38 - excited let me see more beautiful I have
60:42 - some
60:45 - Jada Jada Bara love that
60:49 - [Applause]
60:50 - name Jada Bara says hi I have some basic
60:55 - knowledge in oop AKA objectoriented
60:58 - programming you better not be the I knew
60:59 - it Syndrome guy I will jump on you I
61:03 - have read from read the book from um
61:07 - John zel that you have recommended in
61:08 - your python course and can say I
61:10 - understood it well will this will this
61:12 - your course be still valuable for me I
61:15 - mean I would not be sitting here telling
61:17 - you guys to join it if it's not valuable
61:19 - for you like I'm not here to waste your
61:21 - time I take your time very seriously I
61:23 - take literally I take your time more
61:25 - seriously than I take my time which is
61:27 - why like I think for hours before I go
61:29 - on webinar like I actually have
61:30 - something valuable for you guys again
61:33 - 99% of my material is free go enjoy it
61:37 - learn it like Yang from free material
61:40 - she got th000 she got $800 return on
61:43 - investment just this month in 72 hours
61:46 - just to be clear now imagine what's
61:48 - going to happen this month imagine
61:50 - what's that going to do for the next 12
61:51 - months if she sticks with the next 12
61:53 - months we're talking a 12K return on
61:56 - investment of 5 minutes of her time not
61:59 - even any money infinite
62:02 - infinite infinite percentage growth okay
62:06 - so it's possible for you guys right we
62:08 - have some Freelancers we in our course
62:11 - who are Freelancers but then they're
62:13 - actually taking the course getting those
62:15 - Tech skills and then able to charge a
62:18 - higher
62:20 - price right so there are multiple ways
62:22 - you can go about it one of the people at
62:24 - clever programmer actually got
62:26 - promoted right that's cool what's the
62:30 - return on investment on that maybe
62:31 - $20,000 extra like holy that's
62:35 - crazy I mean you're watching free
62:37 - YouTube videos and you just made $20,000
62:39 - extra per year like in the next 5 years
62:44 - I mean this just humbles me so much I
62:46 - would have helped somebody who just
62:48 - watch a few YouTube videos Earn $100,000
62:51 - in the next five years what does that
62:53 - mean for them they're able to take out
62:55 - their family to places they're able to
62:57 - hold their head up high and go to any
62:59 - place and do kind of make their own
63:01 - decision without being worried like they
63:02 - need to borrow their money from somebody
63:04 - they don't have to feel like they owe
63:05 - anybody else right how many of us hate
63:08 - that feeling of owing other people's
63:10 - stuff right I hated it that's why ever
63:13 - since I was like 14 one of my friends uh
63:16 - Sager and I owe a lot of my stuff to him
63:19 - because he was one of the first people
63:22 - that actually he got me a chess job
63:25 - I was like 14 or 15 at the time and I
63:27 - didn't have any job and I was about to
63:29 - go into I was going to be a security
63:30 - guard right I didn't know anything and I
63:32 - was like I'm I'm just going to be a
63:33 - security guard it's going to be a cool
63:35 - job CU I get to sleep for like eight
63:36 - hours and it's going to be awesome like
63:38 - I'm just going to make 10 bucks an hour
63:40 - like totally I was disrespectful of my
63:42 - time I didn't respect it at that time
63:44 - right I didn't know any better and he
63:45 - got me this job and I mean he he he
63:48 - wasn't interested in it so he just
63:50 - passed it along but what I did is I just
63:52 - took initiative and I jumped on it and
63:54 - and after that my life changed because
63:57 - it it started my Consulting career
63:59 - before I even knew it because the whole
64:01 - job is like you make they pay you $35 an
64:03 - hour and you go and teach kids I mean
64:06 - they're younger kids they're like 9 10
64:08 - year olds and seven year olds but like
64:10 - still you're you're doing a public speak
64:13 - every time so that has helped me that's
64:15 - why I'm not nervous when I'm talking to
64:17 - like I'm actually able to connect with
64:18 - you and talk with you and if we were in
64:20 - person I would have a pretty amazing
64:22 - time with you but it helped then like
64:25 - their parents would be there and then we
64:27 - we would have like 50 students sometimes
64:29 - with like 20 parents being able to speak
64:31 - in front of them so again it was like
64:33 - not even about earning at that time it
64:35 - was about learning right he says in Rich
64:37 - Dad Poor
64:38 - Dad um he say something like you know
64:43 - you should be focusing on earning or
64:44 - sorry learning and not earning
64:46 - especially in the start because then you
64:48 - get that exponential growth right
64:50 - because you are not putting in Standard
64:52 - Act you're not doing standard things so
64:54 - you don't get standard results you get
64:56 - like crazy results like a clever
64:58 - programmer people's YouTube channels
65:00 - take four years to get the results this
65:02 - YouTube channel did amazing in three to
65:04 - four months right it was because I
65:06 - wasn't putting in standard uh
65:09 - action people work hard on their videos
65:12 - and they produce one good edited video a
65:14 - day I'm like how about 30 good edited
65:19 - videos a month like I'm sorry they would
65:21 - put one good edited video a month right
65:24 - and I'm like how about 30 good edited
65:26 - videos a month like holy that's
65:28 - just 10x 30X and uh you get yourself in
65:32 - that mindset and you make it happen like
65:34 - it's possible and so really you know
65:37 - that's one thing I want to give you guys
65:39 - is like a lot of it is in here right
65:41 - that like insecurity and all that it's
65:43 - going to hold you back in a lot of the
65:44 - things you do in your life whether you
65:45 - take this course or not whatever the
65:47 - hell you guys are doing in your life you
65:51 - know don't be insecure like make up your
65:53 - mind and then go go for it give it your
65:55 - all before you kind of look back and try
65:57 - to fall back plans or point fingers and
65:59 - blame other people cuz I want you guys
66:01 - to be successful I want you to be
66:02 - successful
66:04 - okay all right PowerUp says Rachel send
66:07 - me the link please and Rachel did not
66:10 - send him the link it's okay uh we still
66:12 - love you Rachel don't worry guys the
66:14 - link is in my uh description so don't
66:18 - make Rachel overwork herself just
66:23 - kidding
66:24 - KSP in the
66:27 - building that's Kitty guys she's a star
66:30 - student at clever programmer she became
66:33 - so badass by joining clever programmer
66:36 - that she went from knowing nothing she
66:39 - was one of those code cademy stuck in
66:40 - hell rinse and repeat just I'll just do
66:43 - code academy 500 times maybe that'll
66:45 - like trigger something in my
66:47 - brain right didn't work for her she
66:51 - joined clever programmer got good
66:52 - results and now she has has her own
66:54 - website it's called The Savvy coder.com
66:57 - and she's even posting blogs like that's
67:00 - cool that's success when she goes her to
67:02 - her employee or her employer they're
67:04 - going to see that and they're going to
67:06 - like she's not going to have to sit
67:07 - there and negotiate price they're going
67:10 - to be like what what do you want right
67:12 - so once you put in that effort those are
67:14 - the results you get they're very
67:16 - non-standard results they're exponential
67:18 - results right
67:20 - so uh yeah all right the course is
67:25 - amazing go freaking enroll uh ESP says
67:30 - shafik says I'll join now now
67:35 - now if I get that email I'll announce
67:37 - your
67:40 - name it's all about now baby now or
67:43 - never it's 3 hours and 16 minutes from
67:46 - now or
67:48 - never um if things trigger right with
67:51 - you you get that instinct like it it's
67:55 - it's
67:56 - cool right it it uh you like
67:59 - it then don't K the Kazi hop yes I am
68:05 - that is indeed you just witnessed the
68:07 - Kazi hop that was pretty
68:09 - weird Sunny Torres in the
68:14 - building now we're getting some OG
68:16 - students these are like the the original
68:20 - Squad of clever programmer we just got
68:22 - another person to
68:25 - join
68:27 - woohoo what the hell Sony Sony Torres
68:32 - just
68:35 - joined
68:36 - Oh shoot that's really hilarious because
68:44 - uh Sony Torres was on the fence for like
68:48 - eight three months and he was working
68:49 - one-on-one with me I don't know why it
68:51 - took you so long to join sunny you were
68:54 - doing oneon-one with me it cost you so
68:56 - it costs you so much more and you get 10
69:00 - plus hours of recorded content you get
69:02 - live sessions I'm there the whole team
69:04 - is there get to network with people let
69:07 - me reframe a few things for you guys to
69:10 - work with a professional you know like
69:12 - uh you know to work with somebody who's
69:14 - professional in this field you're
69:15 - generally paying them between 50 to $150
69:19 - or $250 an hour or more I was paying one
69:22 - of my mentors back in the day $75 an
69:26 - hour and that was one hour it was
69:29 - invaluable but that was just one hour of
69:31 - her time why I would pay her that much
69:33 - was cuz I would have a problem she would
69:36 - solve it I would have a problem she
69:37 - would solve it and I'm like whatever
69:38 - I'll pay
69:41 - her if you get
69:43 - that for one payment of $97 you get t 10
69:47 - plus hours premium content
69:50 - recorded you can pay you can play it at
69:53 - your own Pace you can watch it wherever
69:55 - you are $75 an hour to 10 plus hours of
70:01 - videos for only
70:03 - $97 you also have live sessions you can
70:05 - also collaborate with other students one
70:07 - of my favorite things is like you get
70:09 - stuck at some stupid thing it'll take
70:11 - you three hours to get past it but you
70:13 - go in the slack channel right our slack
70:15 - Channel and you post something we are
70:18 - ninjas we will be right there and tell
70:20 - you like no you're being you're being
70:22 - dumb delete that thing and then the
70:24 - something that took you 6 hours and you
70:26 - were stuck on now it took you 30 seconds
70:30 - and you've moved past it so those are
70:33 - just few of the things that are pretty
70:35 - unbelievable like it'll get you much
70:38 - faster results cool we just got another
70:43 - enrollment all right cunder says hash
70:48 - best best decision ever # Freedom yes
70:52 - okay you put in the effort and we can
70:56 - get you results okay we this course will
70:59 - get you
71:02 - results I think I think
71:04 - honestly um if you're interested in
71:07 - programming like not only is it a great
71:10 - investment I
71:12 - just like I'm trying to be really
71:14 - unbiased here and I'm thinking like if I
71:16 - was on the side of you guys and I was
71:17 - trying to
71:20 - join like for me it would be like a
71:22 - no-brainer
71:25 - cuz I would think okay like I do this
71:28 - and then I'll like have two sessions
71:29 - with people back in the day then I get
71:31 - my money back and then I just get like
71:33 - extra time doing this and then the
71:35 - skills I learn here apply and make more
71:36 - money that's what I've always done I
71:38 - would take these online courses
71:40 - immediately apply them to my current
71:42 - jobs or like look for opportunities that
71:45 - required those skills so then basically
71:47 - I was earning while I was learning so
71:50 - one cool thing you can do while you're
71:52 - taking this course is you can
71:53 - immediately the things you're learning
71:55 - here right let's say I teach you how to
71:56 - build an app immediately go and give
71:59 - somebody a lesson charge them and help
72:01 - them build a similar app that will one
72:04 - hone your understanding of this make you
72:06 - an expert and two you get to give
72:09 - somebody else results and then obviously
72:12 - three money is just a symptom of you
72:14 - doing something right okay so then
72:17 - obviously they're going to pay you
72:18 - they're going to be like cool you just
72:19 - helped me with something really
72:22 - awesome this course is not going to be
72:24 - deleted after tonight I think Au oh yeah
72:28 - no not deleted that would be horrible I
72:30 - would not delete this course but what
72:32 - happens is that the course is locked
72:36 - after the deadline so no new people can
72:38 - register that's what
72:45 - happens
72:49 - Sunny yeah air horns
72:52 - exactly
72:56 - ah
73:02 - says another person just joined oh man I
73:05 - better start calling out these names man
73:07 - I'm so
73:10 - sorry all right
73:12 - here okay ton oh wait hold on Toya
73:17 - Williams just joined Toya Williams where
73:19 - are where you
73:20 - at
73:22 - um Josh Josh mow just
73:26 - joined Josh
73:30 - mow and
73:32 - Alexandro PR just joined alesandro PR
73:37 - just joined I think I just went really
73:39 - native there even though I'm not
73:52 - native okay more questions from you guys
73:55 - Sunny says hey I wanted to I want I I
73:59 - don't think it's a question but I'm
74:00 - going to read it anyways I wanted to
74:02 - learn Financial modeling and data
74:04 - manipulation first and then learn how to
74:06 - integrate into Apps but I want to learn
74:08 - how to integrate the two
74:13 - now so this is what I mean like he wrote
74:15 - this big question and because I read it
74:17 - out loud I didn't really understand it
74:19 - so like I have to read it quietly and
74:21 - like take my time and then understand it
74:24 - it's so weird I don't know how to
74:25 - explain it but once I understand it I
74:27 - start getting a really deep
74:29 - understanding like I start seeing
74:30 - through the page and stuff and like
74:32 - things start changing colors I get like
74:34 - these really weird
74:52 - insights
74:55 - so Sunny wants to do basically data
74:57 - manipulation Financial
74:59 - modeling and combine it into Apps wow
75:03 - okay yeah that would be really cool
75:05 - because
75:06 - um the I mean there are lots of
75:08 - companies that are going to use that uh
75:11 - and are going to need help with that and
75:13 - I know Sunny where you work you have a
75:14 - pretty good understanding of what you're
75:15 - going to be using this for Facebook
75:18 - stream I wish the page would change
75:20 - colors whenever I think deeply but I
75:22 - guess not yeah yeah Yang you got to you
75:25 - got to get at that
75:27 - level yeah I don't know
75:30 - why oh ah I'm so sorry I was about to
75:33 - say something about you oh yeah yeah
75:35 - yeah okay man I get distracted so easily
75:38 - yo no one wants to take the lesson from
75:40 - me I swear to God I'm about to get over
75:42 - there and grab you by the collar and
75:44 - Shake Your Soul yes there are people who
75:47 - want to take a lesson with you I'm
75:48 - serious you're unless you're just some
75:51 - evil human being like some people even
75:55 - like evil human beings we're we're weird
75:58 - people um you are here I'll tell you
76:01 - something uh really weird I'm going to
76:03 - get inside of your head and it's going
76:04 - to hurt hearing it you're using this as
76:06 - an excuse so you don't have to
76:09 - work and you can so you can justify it
76:11 - to yourself mentally and give yourself
76:14 - that leeway that break so you don't have
76:16 - to do it and this is some this is a
76:19 - common excuse you can tell to other
76:20 - people too to waight off what you're
76:21 - doing it's like when people say
76:23 - oh I'm just not I just wasn't meant for
76:26 - like going to the
76:27 - gym
76:29 - really I just wasn't meant for
76:33 - um you
76:35 - know uh I don't know like learning
76:37 - programming no you you you weren't meant
76:41 - for any like you weren't born to do one
76:44 - thing specifically but you can through
76:47 - habit and through time and actually
76:50 - persistent you you can make pretty much
76:52 - anything happen okay so yeah you can
76:55 - definitely you'll have a uh coming back
76:58 - to you you can you'll definitely have
77:00 - people who want lessons from you you
77:01 - just have to persist look for those
77:03 - people and offer them something of value
77:05 - okay if people are really not doing uh
77:07 - want work with you um then you need to
77:11 - work on your uh soft skills you need to
77:13 - actually like go hang out with more
77:15 - people be a more likable person cuz it
77:18 - doesn't matter if you can do programming
77:19 - nobody wants to hire a person they don't
77:21 - like okay so if you're the problem and
77:24 - you've identified that then you need to
77:26 - go and work on your like social skills
77:30 - and just generally like just meet more
77:32 - people hang out don't even worry about
77:34 - programming for a little while it's
77:35 - important like I'm serious it'll help
77:37 - you uh even mon monetarily speaking like
77:41 - MoneyWise is going to help you work with
77:43 - more people cuz again like people work
77:47 - emotionally right you want to work with
77:48 - people who you
77:52 - like
77:53 - uh hopefully Ahad that answers it I'm
77:55 - sorry I came down on you so
78:01 - hard Sam says after this programing is
78:04 - over we should all go to California yes
78:07 - I I I think once we get a few I don't
78:10 - know like I I might want to do like a
78:11 - live event with you guys honestly CU
78:14 - it's a pretty cool community so I might
78:16 - do a live event or I might bring um like
78:21 - what I would actually like to do is
78:23 - some star students who are doing really
78:25 - good I'll fly you out here no problem
78:28 - like I'll fly you out here you can have
78:31 - uh lunch with me we'll hang out we'll go
78:33 - play some pool go bowling catch a movie
78:36 - we'll do like a live interview um and
78:39 - then we'll record it for everybody to
78:40 - see or just do like a live webinar go
78:43 - live in front of everybody I think it'll
78:45 - be cool
78:46 - so I would be very happy to do
78:51 - that
78:55 - Ivo Ivanov says how long it took you for
78:58 - you to actually start developing your
78:59 - own ideas without having language
79:01 - difficulties that's actually a really
79:03 - insightful questions people who are
79:05 - going to be successful ask really like
79:08 - insightful questions so um first of all
79:12 - I want to congratulate you on your
79:13 - question and here's what I want to say
79:15 - about
79:18 - that I started my career I got into the
79:21 - world of programming while one of them
79:23 - is my brother my little brother calling
79:24 - me telling me about Hadoop and saying
79:26 - how college students right outside of
79:27 - college right out of college make
79:29 - $200,000 using Hadoop so that was that
79:32 - was cool but something that really got
79:36 - me interested was I was running my
79:39 - business called uh chess tastic and it
79:41 - was for chess okay so again I play chess
79:44 - competitively I like compete at all
79:46 - levels uh top 1% in the country if not
79:49 - the world
79:51 - and what I did was actually started my
79:54 - own chess business and I had my company
79:56 - and we would offer programs at libraries
79:58 - and schools and all that you know ever
80:00 - since I was a very young like probably
80:01 - 18
80:02 - 19 um I've just always been an
80:04 - entrepreneur like it's just in my blood
80:07 - I can't help it for me it's more risky
80:09 - to think about like 9 to5 jobs honestly
80:12 - it scares me cuz I'm like wait so how do
80:15 - you feel safe there just one client and
80:18 - if they fire you you're like done so
80:20 - how's how's there Security in that but
80:22 - me I always try to have like more
80:23 - clients and then the beauty is that
80:26 - again not only do they get to be
80:28 - selective about you you get to be
80:29 - selective about them and everybody
80:31 - respects each other and U it's just more
80:34 - fun it's a more healthy relationship
80:37 - between the two nobody is anybody's boss
80:39 - right you're like friends essentially
80:41 - and you offer each other value and you
80:43 - bring better things into each other's
80:45 - life okay so um Ivo I started in chess
80:51 - and basically what I was trying to do
80:53 - was I was trying to write this algorithm
80:55 - that scrapes the web and pulls out all
80:58 - the middle schools that have chess
81:00 - programs and not like high schools and
81:03 - not middle schools below a certain grade
81:04 - level and not middle schools that are
81:06 - like religious or not middle schools
81:08 - that don't offer chess programs so I had
81:10 - to filter all this on certain criteria
81:12 - because what I was doing initially was
81:14 - like I would go to Google make a call go
81:16 - to Google type in like a library name um
81:20 - get their number put it in my Excel
81:22 - sheet then I would go to another Google
81:24 - like I would Google another a Library
81:26 - address or a school address and I would
81:30 - put that in my Excel sheet take their
81:31 - phone number put in my Excel sheet and
81:33 - what I was finding out that it was
81:35 - taking
81:36 - me like forever to get that done I was
81:40 - like wow this really sucks like there
81:42 - must be a better way another
81:44 - student good job you guys 3 hours left
81:47 - you guys are you guys are decision maker
81:50 - no my YouTube live stream just died I
81:52 - need need
82:00 - this damn
82:05 - it wow that just made me really
82:11 - sad come on you
82:16 - phone all right anybody want to remind
82:19 - me what I was talking about because I
82:20 - kind of
82:21 - forgot
82:28 - all
82:31 - right Sean
82:34 - says I signed up for a python course
82:36 - yesterday on udem me for $10 to be blunt
82:39 - what does your course offer for
82:43 - $97 how could you charge $97 for your
82:46 - course let me go step by step you build
82:50 - apps in less than 7even days step by
82:53 - step from scratch you're not dependent
82:55 - on looking at your screen your brain
82:57 - going blank by looking at a blank screen
83:00 - you get the tools to build those apps by
83:03 - yourself you're not following just my
83:05 - tutorials and then without me you're
83:07 - screwed the whole idea is to give you
83:09 - these tools so you can build everything
83:12 - you know by yourself as soon as you
83:13 - learn it from me you're able to apply it
83:15 - and do things with it on your own and
83:17 - deviate and go play with your own
83:19 - examples hard to do with some of these
83:22 - online courses that kind of give you
83:24 - this giant thing that you can't do
83:26 - anything about now something more okay
83:29 - than UD me course you get a private
83:31 - community of other like-minded students
83:33 - who are very driven serious dedicated
83:35 - and want to either you know improve
83:37 - their in their career or you can work
83:39 - with them to build a personalized
83:41 - project you can work with them to go and
83:43 - find a new job you can work with them to
83:45 - book new clients you can work with them
83:47 - to start your own freaking business and
83:49 - website that's what I would do if I got
83:52 - together with like-minded people who
83:54 - were driven I would talk with them and I
83:56 - would say hey man or hey girl let's
83:58 - figure it out let's see if we can start
84:01 - something together it could be a website
84:03 - it could be a business we could go book
84:04 - clients we can charge them for certain
84:06 - thing we can build an app together you
84:09 - get that in my course you don't get that
84:10 - at udem me you know what else you get at
84:12 - this course live sessions with everybody
84:15 - so all of you guys are there at least
84:16 - once a month we're sitting in front of
84:18 - each other you guys get to have a mic
84:21 - mic and a camera camera you guys get to
84:23 - talk with everybody you guys get to talk
84:25 - with
84:26 - me that you don't get at uh unim right
84:32 - um what else you get emails from me

84:38 - don't get that at em me okay
84:43 - um projects exercises quizzes you get a
84:47 - little bit of that udemy oh here's
84:49 - another thing boring courses on udemy
84:52 - I'm sorry I'm just going to say it
84:54 - boring like screencasts and they're just
84:56 - deathly boring I can't do it like I
84:59 - can't do it um it's so hard for me to go
85:02 - through those courses honestly so yeah
85:06 - you don't have those these are made with
85:07 - heart these are made with love I take a
85:10 - lot of time to craft them and make them
85:13 - so when you guys get something it's
85:14 - truly the best because again 99% of my
85:18 - material is
85:19 - free I I me I just would wouldn't charge
85:23 - if it actually literally wasn't worth
85:25 - your money or your time because I'm not
85:27 - here to waste your time and like I've
85:28 - said I value your guys' time actually
85:31 - more than
85:34 - mine hopefully that answers your uh
85:51 - question
86:00 - coding is similar to math in that almost
86:03 - nobody just naturally picks it up easily
86:06 - I had to start with Elementary algebra
86:08 - in college worked up to B+ in calculus
86:12 - because I really wanted to learn
86:21 - it
86:26 - sorry guys one
86:28 - second um Nick cook just joined Nick
86:33 - cook
86:38 - welcome
86:40 - Rashad
86:42 - ROK just joined welcome if you're here
86:47 - hit me
86:51 - back
86:53 - yep you're welcome Sean um I love that
86:56 - question and you know you're right you
86:58 - have to be blunt and ask the hard
87:00 - questions and those are the questions a
87:02 - lot of people are uh afraid to ask or
87:05 - even to answer so I'm glad that you took
87:09 - that initiative to an ask that question
87:11 - love
87:11 - it how did clever programmer start
87:16 - um long story I'll make it
87:19 - short last year I was going to UIC
87:23 - had this thought of starting this
87:25 - channel um and my routine looked like
87:27 - this every day I would wake up at 5:30
87:30 - a.m. exactly I'm not a morning person I
87:33 - changed that through listening to books
87:35 - a book was called 21 sleeping
87:39 - strategies for
87:41 - healthier 21 smart sleeping I don't know
87:44 - it's like long L but it was like 21
87:45 - something sleeping strategies and um he
87:49 - just talks about how good it is to sleep
87:51 - at 10: p.m. you know you know you get in
87:52 - that circadian rhythm cycle gets your
87:54 - blood flowing better it gets your mind
87:56 - right it gets your energy up uh you can
87:59 - lift better in the morning your appetite
88:01 - is better so then that way you can eat
88:03 - more um your vitamin D levels remain
88:08 - high and just overall your productivity
88:12 - levels go through the roof and it was
88:13 - true that happened with me so I would
88:15 - sleep at 10 p.m wake up at 5:30 a.m.
88:17 - because that's like I think we I would
88:19 - do four to five sleeping Cycles cuz
88:21 - every sleeping cycle 1 and a half hour
88:22 - so I would sleep 10 wake up at 5:30
88:27 - sharp I would um I had everything timed
88:31 - like I would visualize my day the night
88:33 - before and I would do everything step by
88:35 - step like I I would write it down in my
88:37 - Wonder list like get out of bed at 5:30
88:41 - uh about 5:30 a.m. um get out of the
88:45 - basement and step onto the first floor
88:48 - at 5:37 a.m. get into the shower at like
88:52 - 5:45
88:54 - a.m. get out of the shower at 6:00 a.m.
88:57 - get uh get done eating breakfast at 6:30
89:00 - a.m. 6:20 a.m. by like what you can
89:04 - measure you can
89:05 - change okay it's really important write
89:07 - it down what you can what you can
89:10 - measure you can change okay so by
89:14 - measuring this what was happening was I
89:16 - was getting very efficient and mindful
89:17 - of everything uh because sometimes
89:19 - you'll realize you'll be taking a shower
89:21 - and you'll just take 2 hours for no
89:23 - reason or you'll like be talking to
89:25 - somebody and you'll just take 50 minutes
89:27 - talking and by letting that time leak
89:30 - that's what happens where at the end of
89:31 - the day you're like I'm just so busy and
89:34 - then you look back at your day and
89:35 - you're like I went to a job and then
89:38 - that was it so why am I so drained and
89:40 - why am I so like why can't I do anything
89:43 - so again 5:30 a.m. I would wake up I
89:46 - would like you know read read a book in
89:48 - the morning I would go to the gym I
89:51 - would get done lifting I would get to
89:52 - the go to the train in the train I would
89:54 - read books and then I would go to
89:57 - college I would go to work and then any
89:59 - time I got which was very little I would
90:02 - have my day planned and I would just
90:03 - produce videos like I had planned okay
90:06 - so I would just do that every time just
90:09 - did it for many months
90:12 - consistently
90:15 - non-stop I was like a little Annoying
90:17 - with how crazy I was about it right with
90:19 - that system and then just got pretty
90:22 - good results so that's kind of you know
90:25 - how it went not every day was perfect
90:26 - not every day I slept at 10:00 or woke
90:28 - up at 5:30 like you know it changes but
90:31 - my main priorities were like I have to
90:33 - get this done and I would just try to
90:35 - get that thing done like YouTube video
90:37 - every single time and then it started
90:41 - picking up you know you guys paid
90:43 - attention you guys enjoyed it and uh you
90:47 - guys brought your boy on deck and made
90:50 - this a reality
90:53 - okay my why is my phone so stupid it's
90:55 - just
90:58 - dead all right I yeah I was also
91:01 - answering your question I'm very sneaky
91:04 - with no I mean I'm not sneaky but I just
91:06 - you know brain works weird it's slow but
91:09 - once I'm in I'm like I catch everything
91:12 - so I saw your question and I wanted to
91:14 - uh you know kind of answer that too all
91:17 - right Kitty peace out good
91:20 - night
91:24 - if you want to start a YouTube
91:26 - channel start it like it doesn't it's
91:29 - not any you know extra extra work or
91:33 - whatever you can just kind of get
91:35 - started um it just takes effort and it
91:39 - just takes time like that's what it is
91:41 - it's most people get discouraged without
91:43 - seeing results and one of my extreme
91:48 - skills is that
91:50 - I
91:54 - I'm very crazy about implications of
91:56 - things so like when I see when I saw 20
92:01 - cents when I was doing Bitcoin mining I
92:03 - was like if I scale this that's like
92:06 - thousands of dollars and most people
92:08 - can't see that like most people just see
92:10 - this this this computer just sitting
92:11 - here making 20 cents what the hell can I
92:13 - do with 20 cents but what they're not
92:15 - thinking is like this computer is
92:16 - sitting
92:18 - here literally nobody's doing anything
92:20 - extra and it's just generating
92:23 - money now what if I scaled it and what
92:27 - if to increase my profit margin I found
92:29 - out ways where the electricity cost was
92:32 - lower or the maintenance cost was lower
92:35 - what if I could like host it in a cloud
92:37 - what if what if I could like get a
92:39 - service now it's scalable right but
92:43 - people don't really people see the first
92:44 - thing and then they're kind of stop and
92:46 - that's what happened and that's what
92:48 - kept me going right so when I would see
92:51 - one subscri subscriber every day I was
92:54 - like Wow before there was Zero
92:56 - subscribers now it's one subscriber
92:57 - every day I mean so I and I also make my
93:01 - goals really small every time like sure
93:03 - I want to be at the level where I have
93:06 - six packs but if your goal is that
93:08 - you'll quit the next day so what your
93:10 - goal has to be is a little bit different
93:11 - for example when you go to the gym your
93:13 - goal should just be hey I'm going to
93:14 - increase uh incrementally so uh 2 and2
93:18 - lbs extra on each side so 5 lbs I'm
93:20 - going to increase my S on my deadlift
93:22 - I'm going to put 10 lb extra on my bench
93:25 - I'm going to put this many pounds extra
93:26 - right and then you get your form right
93:29 - you get your squat you know you got your
93:31 - squat right you focus on the little
93:34 - goals in between you trick your mind you
93:37 - make those goals really important but
93:40 - the whole time you're actually going
93:41 - towards that bigger goal but you don't
93:42 - let your mind think about that because
93:44 - your mind is very easily tricked it just
93:46 - goes oh but the six-pack but I don't
93:48 - have it and I just quit so you have that
93:51 - that long goal in your head you tell
93:53 - your brain to shut up you set these
93:56 - middle and small goals and then you
93:59 - follow them and you enjoy those goals
94:02 - and you make make goals that are all
94:04 - follow like deliverable actionable right
94:07 - like your goal shouldn't
94:09 - be how can I start a $2 million
94:14 - business I'll go to like a vcn pitch
94:17 - you're going to you're just you're
94:19 - setting yourself up for failure
94:22 - how about how can I do something where
94:24 - people pay me 5
94:25 - cents okay now how can I take it to 10
94:28 - cents and how can I take you 20 cents
94:31 - scale it systematically improve it test
94:34 - it ask somebody to pay you $10 and then
94:37 - go hm I just went from 50 cents to $10
94:39 - by just asking or if they say no you're
94:42 - like hm maybe I can go
94:43 - lower so you know a lot of these things
94:46 - are very systematic have these small
94:48 - goals that you set up and then follow
94:50 - them through you'll get to your ultimate
94:53 - goal but you won't get to your ultimate
94:54 - goal if that's the only thing you're
94:56 - following cuz you don't have any little
94:57 - motivational snacks in
94:59 - between the the motivational snacks that
95:02 - should actually be a
95:05 - quote
95:15 - um okay so let's see mwanza just

99:41 - be looking for even more serious

101:15 - C++ course for
101:17 - free cs50 pretty damn good it's C uh but
101:23 - once you learn C you learn everything
101:24 - C++ too so when I was learning it cuz I
101:27 - wanted to learn C at some point or and
101:29 - or C++ sorry and I was like there were
101:32 - there are no good courses for C++ that
101:34 - kind of sucks so I learned C and then
101:39 - yeah it's C++ is not much different I
101:41 - just picked it up pretty
101:45 - fast nice sahad

102:07 - right
102:19 - back

103:36 - all right guys I will be right
103:41 - back I will get some more Diet Coke for
103:44 - you

106:49 - e
107:49 - e
108:19 - e
109:19 - e
109:49 - for
110:19 - e
110:43 - [Music]
110:46 - what
110:49 - hello
111:00 - hey guys what's
111:07 - up welcome
111:12 - back hey
111:17 - Matias okay Matias so let me answer your
111:19 - question he says I was going to sign up
111:23 - but then I found out I have to pay an
111:25 - extra
111:27 - $46 and it's actually not 46 it's
111:30 - $47 you have to pay extra or something
111:33 - for full access Community which was a
111:35 - bit disappointing so Matas was
111:37 - disappointed because he had to pay more
111:40 - let me put it this way this should not
111:43 - be $47 for onetime payment it should
111:46 - actually be $47 a
111:48 - month because that's the kind of
111:50 - community you guys have so if you get
111:53 - this community for extra
111:55 - $47 and you can even I don't know land a
111:59 - job where you can work for $50 an hour
112:02 - that's like one hour of your time and
112:04 - you make it back so yeah it's a little
112:07 - bit more expensive but there was a
112:09 - deadline that I announced to everybody
112:11 - on my email and I told everybody that I
112:15 - think it was on Tuesday the cut off time
112:17 - was Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. the slack
112:20 - channel uh is actually not part of the
112:22 - course you have to pay an extra 47 to
112:24 - join it so that's really you know where
112:29 - I'm at with that so hopefully that
112:31 - answers your question but I honestly
112:33 - think it's a steal it's a good
112:34 - investment in yourself but hey look if
112:36 - you're not ready or willing to uh go
112:38 - that route right now that's okay um you
112:42 - still will have access to me you'll
112:44 - we'll still have live sessions live
112:45 - webinars right uh we'll still be adding
112:48 - more and more content to this course so
112:50 - keep in mind you're ping $97 right now
112:52 - for potentially a course that's going to
112:53 - be two three four $500 maybe even
112:58 - more so right now you lock it in at the
113:00 - current price if I add future content
113:03 - it's yours to keep if I add new videos
113:06 - they're yours if I have new live webinar
113:08 - and sessions they're yours you want to
113:11 - collaborate with other students sure
113:13 - okay all at the price of $97 thankful is
113:17 - $500 a month College course is $1,500 a
113:21 - month and you don't learn nearly enough
113:23 - the people you're working with at in the
113:25 - class are all confused They Don't Really
113:27 - Care they're not even interested they
113:29 - don't even know what career they want to
113:30 - get into they just happen to be doing
113:32 - programming and you're mixing a crowd of
113:34 - everybody this community is like people
113:37 - who are dedicated to really advance and
113:39 - take themselves to the next level if I
113:41 - put some barriers in front it makes it
113:43 - even a better Community when you guys
113:45 - join because everybody who's in here is
113:48 - making a commitment they're saying we're
113:50 - making an investment they're not here to
113:51 - waste your time you're not here to waste
113:53 - theirs you're really both there to hold
113:56 - each other accountable move
113:58 - forward uh how many have already paid
114:00 - for the community let me tell
114:06 - you
114:09 - 98 just joined uh it's actually more
114:12 - people that have paid for the community
114:14 - some people haven't even joined the
114:16 - community yet uh their enrollments are
114:19 - actually on pause so it's going to be
114:21 - probably 110 115 people in the community
114:24 - it's going to be more here I'll just
114:26 - send you a screen in screenshot of the
114:28 - community so you can see kind of uh what
114:31 - it looks like in here and uh what's
114:34 - going
114:44 - on all right I just took this screenshot
114:47 - right now slack community
114:50 - Community okay take a look at
114:53 - it you'll see that people are posting
114:55 - their code other people are commenting
114:59 - um we'll answer your questions
115:01 - everybody's collaborating with each
115:02 - other so on the left hand side you'll
115:04 - see something called direct messages
115:06 - everybody's able to directly message so
115:08 - you can one-on-one communicate with
115:10 - everybody or you can actually just be in
115:11 - one of our channels and then communicate
115:14 - with everybody else that way so it's a
115:16 - pretty transparent Community we over 100
115:18 - students in like
115:21 - literally by the way um in the last like
115:25 - three days we had over hundreds of
115:27 - students joined our program so you know
115:30 - uh everybody's excited everybody's
115:32 - coming on board uh and they're having
115:34 - fun and I'm you know I just sent you a
115:35 - screenshot of it so take a look at
115:41 - it Matas you have a lot of
115:45 - questions um look if you're not ready
115:48 - that is totally okay again I will answer
115:51 - some of your um you have to take that
115:54 - link Matas and copy and paste it in a
115:57 - URL okay that's how you'll see this
116:02 - link you don't want to pay for it and be
116:04 - there alone you're not alone again I
116:06 - just said you have over a 100 students
116:08 - in
116:09 - there IPL you're not too late to the
116:12 - stream basically the course is closing
116:14 - down two hours left to make the deadline
116:17 - so if you guys are new here you have two
116:19 - hours left to make the deadline in short
116:22 - way what's offered in the course is
116:24 - again stepbystep instructions for you to
116:27 - be able to go from code to making your
116:29 - apps from scratch in Python okay
116:32 - something you can show employers
116:33 - something that you can actually put on
116:36 - your portfolio and charge clients a
116:38 - higher price for uh you'll Master the
116:40 - fundamentals of object-oriented
116:42 - programming so guy graphical user
116:43 - interfac is what you see in front of you
116:45 - click click click everything right
116:48 - otherwise we would be back in 1970s so
116:50 - you'll have that you'll have a live
116:52 - one-on-one Master call with me for 15
116:55 - minutes where we discuss your strategy
116:58 - for the next two to three months we lay
117:00 - down a road map of what you're going to
117:02 - be doing for the next X amount of months
117:04 - so then that way you're very clear with
117:07 - what your priorities are okay so again I
117:10 - think that's pretty valuable and it
117:11 - might be really valuable for
117:14 - you we have live uh sessions so they're
117:18 - called live accelerat hacking sessions
117:20 - where we get together at least once a
117:22 - month and we all connect and we do
117:25 - either coding challenges or like a live
117:27 - uh you know Mack interview or Q&A so
117:30 - questions and answers so you'll get to
117:32 - be part of that you'll get uh emails
117:35 - where I'll send you extra videos or
117:37 - extra uh you know resources and guides
117:40 - you'll have weekly check-ins every
117:42 - Monday I'll check in with you I'm going
117:44 - to send out surveys get your guys' uh
117:47 - questions you know I'll email you them
117:48 - and I'll get your guys' opinions on
117:50 - things and suggestions and we'll tweak
117:52 - the course to that that's why it's a 30
117:55 - to 60 day Sprint so you guys are going
117:58 - to be actually I'm inviting you guys to
118:00 - this so then we can really take this
118:02 - course to the next level together okay
118:03 - so that's really what's going on here uh
118:06 - the link is in the description of this
118:17 - video um oh I sent you the link at the
118:20 - top uh HTTP d.
118:23 - PRI SLX rt4 so I'll put that at the
118:28 - bottom
118:29 - again that's the
118:33 - link okay so uh here's what I'm going to
118:37 - be
118:38 - doing um I'm going to go offline in a
118:44 - little bit and then I'm sure you guys
118:46 - will have a ton of questions you know in
118:48 - the last hour stretch cuz right now you
118:50 - guys have 2 hours and 25 minutes to
118:52 - decide go to the page learn more about
118:55 - the course understand that this is a
118:57 - no-brainer with a 30-day money back
118:59 - guarantee you call me I refund you no
119:02 - questions asked I'm not here to nickel
119:03 - and dime you not here to do whatever
119:05 - right but I want but you have
119:08 - responsibility in this course like I
119:10 - want you to actually take I want you to
119:12 - be involved in this course I want you to
119:14 - actually put in work this is not some
119:17 - again magic course we just going to take
119:19 - it and somehow you're going to get
119:20 - better by breathing and watching videos
119:22 - you're going to get better by watching
119:23 - videos but you're going to get a lot
119:25 - better when you actually take the uh you
119:28 - know the like the assignments that are
119:31 - given to you and what you're expected to
119:32 - do once you put in that work you're
119:34 - going to see you're going to be putting
119:36 - in two times of work as usual and you're
119:38 - going to be getting 10 times of results
119:40 - right that's really what I'm trying to
119:42 - do here I'm taking lots of
119:44 - other cor uh you know corsera online
119:49 - mukes and all of that and really making
119:51 - this uh as a best resource that has
119:53 - those things outlined I think in the
119:55 - best
119:59 - way yeah yeah uh IPL great question
120:03 - that's exactly where actually all of
120:04 - these courses are headed right now
120:06 - you're going to make local desktop
120:08 - applications with python and then
120:09 - eventually and the reason is so you
120:11 - don't you don't deal with any of the
120:12 - online complexity cuz when you combine
120:15 - online with an app that makes things
120:17 - very complicated so what we're going to
120:19 - be doing is we're going to only build
120:21 - something local with python we're going
120:24 - to build multiple apps you actually get
120:26 - ideas how it actually works and then I'm
120:29 - going to show you uh how to take it
120:31 - online so then you're not getting
120:35 - confused between connecting those two
120:37 - parts together you'll understand how to
120:39 - develop an app and then you'll
120:41 - understand how to bring it online and
120:43 - all you have to do is just connect the
120:44 - two and then boom your flask app or your
120:48 - Django app is up and running so
120:52 - yeah yeah Jan Tapper I'm sorry quality
120:55 - is definitely better than this morning
120:57 - the webinar that you are at um but yes
121:00 - the sound is not
121:03 - synchronized okay guys so I wanted to
121:06 - answer your questions I wanted to answer
121:08 - your concerns because I understand it's
121:11 - an investment in yourself but that's
121:13 - truly the idea to take this and get that
121:16 - return on your investment immediately
121:17 - because I don't want you to be thinking
121:19 - oh man like I need to really if you're
121:21 - tied up on money don't you know I don't
121:24 - want you to be worrying about that when
121:26 - you invest in this course because you'll
121:27 - not focus on learn you're not you won't
121:29 - be able to focus on learning but that's
121:31 - why I give you so many tools to earn
121:32 - your money back and 10 times more is
121:35 - because then when you actually are in
121:38 - the course you're able to just learn and
121:41 - focus on it and you don't have to worry
121:43 - about anything else because you're
121:45 - already you got your return on your
121:47 - investment you're not like I invested in
121:49 - here do I get anything back do I not get
121:51 - anything back okay so it's really to so
121:53 - you don't have to worry about
122:03 - that my website is not on WordPress my
122:06 - chest tasc.com website was on WordPress
122:10 - because I was not a developer back
122:14 - then and because I realized that I had
122:17 - to use Excel sheets to do everything I
122:20 - realized there had I figured there had
122:22 - to be a better way I ended up hiring a
122:24 - programmer paid him $500 to write a
122:26 - simple script which I'll show you guys
122:29 - in my course to write and you guys will
122:31 - learn it and uh you won't have to pay
122:33 - 500 bucks for it I did because it was
122:36 - helping me with my business at the time
122:38 - and using that script we were able to
122:40 - pull all of the schools middle schools
122:44 - uh that I could actually based on a
122:46 - certain criteria that I could call and
122:50 - book my uh chess sessions with them so
122:53 - because I I had a company for chess
122:56 - tastic and we would you know put our
122:58 - programs in their schools and we would
123:01 - put our programs in their uh libraries
123:04 - as
123:06 - well okay guys so that's it for now we
123:10 - already had a really long session we're
123:12 - at 2 hours and 2 minutes I'm going to
123:14 - let you guys go and I'm going to come
123:18 - back when you guys have one hour left
123:19 - cuz I'm pretty sure you guys going to
123:21 - have ton of questions the link is still
123:23 - here you guys can click that link to
123:25 - check out the course um I think you're
123:28 - going to really enjoy this course
123:29 - there's just a ton of content that's not
123:31 - covered in courses like Linda udem me
123:34 - corsera whatever else right you have
123:36 - that Community you have those live
123:38 - sessions you have uh all these exercises
123:41 - you you have all this accountability
123:43 - people to network with you get those
123:45 - emails to hold you accountable you get
123:47 - those weekly check-ins like those things
123:50 - are not offered at all those other
123:51 - places and again thinkful which doesn't
123:54 - even offer all of those things is $500 a
123:56 - month and then other programming boot
123:58 - camps like full stack Academy is
124:01 - $155,000 uh for three months then you
124:04 - have um you know C Udacity courses where
124:08 - you only get feedback and that's $200 a
124:11 - month so really a lot of these options
124:14 - are uh pretty expensive and they still
124:18 - don't give you you all of the stuff
124:20 - that's offered okay so I really want to
124:22 - make this a no-brainer for you guys make
124:24 - it really easy and simple uh but yeah
124:27 - again I'll
124:31 - come I'll uh join Nathan I'm going to be
124:34 - adding new stuff to the Course once it's
124:36 - closed once everybody's on board and
124:39 - starting Monday we'll really be kind of

124:44 - really exciting like I'm ex super
124:46 - excited about that cuz we're going to
124:48 - really add new things we're going to
124:50 - build new apps um and we'll connect with
124:53 - each other to make sure that everybody
124:54 - is on track okay so in the start I want
124:58 - to make sure that everybody's on the

Cleaned transcript:

whoa okay live hey how's it going okay so uh doing something new today I am okay yeah so the new thing that I'm doing today is that I am going Live on YouTube as well as actually going live on Facebook so I'm live in both places I feel like I feel like Ty Lopez right now it's kind of weird so this is Facebook hello Facebook that's YouTube hi YouTube how are you guys doing I love it it's like the best of the both both worlds oh my friend Matthew is here hey Matthew how's it going Chris gamer Roshan that's right I've been going live at random times today guys sorry it's been hectic uh I actually just ran my look at how sexy this mouse is by the way so good um I just ran my webinar today with 500 people so that was pretty insane uh but it went well so it was really fun Chris gamer did not join I'm disappointed Chris gamer how how could you do that broke my heart I think I just sounded like uh what's his name PewDiePie hey uh who here watches PewDiePie or who here watches um what's his name h3h3 all right so Sager is here hey Sager nice to meet you you found my Facebook live stream yeah you know YouTube live stream is kind of crazy YouTube live stream right now we're at 20 27 people and Facebook live stream we're at one person so uh pretty big difference right there sorry guys I'm just figuring some stuff out today is going to be a long today is going to be a long live stream so this is going to be fun I've never done I've never done like um live stream like this this before okay fixing up some stuff sorry I'm fixing up my descriptions they're wrong should have done it before the stream start but oh well we'll be getting we'll be we'll be good to go in a second guys just give me a second here I'm sorry all right fixed up that description yeah intro to Udacity is pretty good hey Bonnie how's it going man Bonnie pom Nani no plan today I'm just kind of Pumped where is my hat all right so today as you guys know one of the craziest thing is about to happen and I'm going to announce it in a little bit we're going to wait till we get some more people first of all what do you guys think about this hat we getting some love on Facebook for this hat all right sweet sweet yes uh the Facebook live stream is definitely more stable than YouTube I don't know YouTube live stream is so bad I mean I love you guys here on the YouTube but just the live stream is just not very good you know hey uh somebody in my YouTube description can you tell me if it talks about my O course in there or like did that did that not change oh your changes are not Sav oh interesting interesting all right how about this changes are being saved all changes saved okay boom changes saved no this session is just pretty chill don't need any um don't need any crazy stuff yeah yeah so today was a crazy day we had 500 people show up at the webinar and register we were only supposed to have 50 people and um we had 500 so that was insane and today some cool stuff is about to go down oh yeah thank you for telling me about my description thank you thank you really nice really cool uh Patrick hi host sir Matt luk I signed up tonight yeah I think I remember your name I think you definitely did sign up tonight whenever you guys sign up it actually calls my phone so if you sign up it'll actually mess up my Facebook live stream which is hilarious but whatever it's cool yeah so this hat was actually given to me by my friend uh and his mom made it for me that was cool his mom has never not been here for like years she finally came to United States I thought that was pretty nice Devin shout out to Devin I remember adding you buddy nice welcome on board James it's definitely not you my friend uh YouTube is very finicky with its audio synchronization I I don't know how Google is such a big company but they haven't figured this out yet it's a little confusing to me okay so tonight in four hours as you can see on my YouTube I think right here I'm going to pretend like I'm looking at it right hold on right there okay my course is ending in four hours okay the registration for that closes so if you guys have any questions about it let me know uh I'd be happy to help and otherwise we're going to kind of chill here for a little bit of a longer time and if you guys just have any questions in general and if I can bring value to your life you know ask me the questions while you have me here so I can answer them for you Antonia says after sign up we should pay $99 well you can't sign up unless you pay $99 buddy I love you too Yemen Yemen yav lft WFT what do you mean by course registration what I mean is like should I just say my yeah I mean nobody can enroll in my course okay so I guess my course enrollment ends tonight if that's any easier you know if that makes more sense sure so my python op course essentially takes you from a complete beginner to a coding ninja from a beginner to being able to build apps step by step in less than 7 Days and 7 days and is an exaggeration because one of the students his name is David he actually built his apps in two hours so it's kind of cool but yeah it's really like a stepbystep system that takes you there um also you master objectoriented programming why is that important well all of the graphical user interface that you see around you for for example where you are commenting that's a graphical user interface where hi jenica Doma nice to have you that's awesome Bonnie says I want some good python valuable projects to add in my resume Bonnie got to work hard for that takes time takes time takes time and consistent effort systematic methodical approach you'll get there my friend don't worry so yeah anyways I was talking about graphical user interfaces right you comment using them you look at pictures using them you interact with the websites using them you use apps using them right without a graphical user interface you'd be back in 1970s with the Dos command line but that changed cuz we got something called guy which is graphical user interfaces I'm going to take this hat off at this point love this hat all right cool so graphical user interfaces right like it's EV everything around you is basically a graphical user interface so you master that in the course okay and you learn the fundamentals behind it so instead of like you really just I don't know like uh copying code you know on these tutorial websites where you'll just copy all this code and then when the time comes and you're looking at a blank screen your brain is also a blank and you're sitting there scratching yourself does that happen to you guys say yes or no if that happens where you look at a empty screen and you're trying to write code and your brain just kind of goes blank Bruce hello my friend Bruce welcome Bruce welcome welcome everybody how long is the O course great question right now it's about um you know it'll be about even more than 10 plus hours of Premium video content and it's going to constantly getting be getting new videos it's going to constantly be getting new upgrades future bonuses new live sessions um all of that stuff that's going to be added to it is going to be absolutely free of cost to you if you lock it in at the current price but if you miss the tonight's deadline which is in 4 hours on YouTube it's right over here if you miss that my friend you miss it then the next time the course comes it's going to be way more expensive and I'm going to give you a pretty good reason why so I've gone through courses on corsera and also I'm going to spit out these names of these awesome resources if you want to use these free resources write them down okay if you by the way if you have any other tabs open just close them okay just relax put on your headsets get some popcorn get a drink get some water sit in your pajamas and just you know just relax and watch cuz we're going to be in this for the long run uh I'm going to answer all of your questions okay do not worry I'm going to go through um everybody and answer but yeah so all of that content you lock it in at the current price and then you kind of you're able to get it all right so basically you know I've taken course on corser I've taken them on Udacity I've taken taken them on um udem I've taken courses on free code Camp Linda like everything you could imagine like 50 different resources okay and then I've also been able to work as a software consultant for many different clients and I've also done lots of personal coaching so this course essentially takes the best out of all of those courses and also you know it has a spin of being able to work as an independent contractor in it which I think is kind of cool cuz my course really focuses also on you getting the return on your investment that you put in the course also for the price of this course there is no other course that has weekly checkins with you on every Monday that's what I want to be able to do with you guys okay ah somebody just got the course so the Facebook stream went offline I'm going to have to hang up this call one second Facebook stream is back awesome so whenever somebody actually gets the course uh it gives me a call on my phone which is really cool thank you for blessing with Udacity Devan he says yes you're welcome Mario yeah so the course you guys can also get it for $33 per month like that's nothing $33 per month okay for three uh for three months sorry that's it for three Mon it's a threemonth payment plan okay I offered that for you guys $33 what is $33 let me break this down to you you go you teach you get one student that you teach a private lesson to generally private lessons you can very easily even as a beginner charge between $50 to $75 an hour or more but let's say you're super hesitant you're not confident in your negotiation skills you're like maybe if I could please teach you blah blah blah right and you land just one student that you can teach which is super easy and I show you how to do that and I'll be showing you consistently throughout our live sessions and the emails I'll send you and all of that let's say you get one student for $20 an hour okay for two hours in a whole month working with that you've made your return on investment plus seven bucks for that month okay and generally when you book a student you know you you have them for a recurring like you know uh one session a week for example so you can be looking at 80 bucks per student if you're doing $20 an hour with one student so I mean even in just the first month with four hours of your time you're getting a return on your investment okay so that is kind of like a nobrainer okay another really cool thing is I'm doing something called Sprint which is something software developers do uh and it's a project management system so we're going to have a Sprint in this session and that's why why I'm uh inviting you guys to this course because I want your help to take it to the next level so it's going to be a 30 to 60day Long Sprint and essentially how it's going to work is let's say you join right here okay and we have a 30day Sprint what's going to happen is that every Monday I'm going to check in with you guys so whether it's with surveys or we personally get in touch with you or I personally get in touch with you I'm going to get your feedback and the course is going to be structured around that okay also then when we have our live sessions and our live meetings we'll add those new things in so let's say you guys are saying hey we don't want to do monthly live sessions we want to do like biweekly live sessions you got it we'll have that you guys will be like hey I think I want to see this in the course or I want to build this kind of app in your service on the Monday that I check in with you and hold you accountable to your goals you got it we're going to add that to the course so really this course we're going to be developing it together as well there's already a ton of of content in there that'll take you a long time to catch up on but there's going to be new stuff and we're going to be able to build that together right that's pretty exciting like I think that's pretty exciting and contrast that with a coding online boot camp like thanful thinkful charges you not even for that kind of service they charge you $500 a month you know how I know cuz I was in I I've enrolled in thankful uh and also here you get a community of other students so you collaborate with everybody else whether you want to do uh software Consulting work while collaborating with other students you want to do personal projects with them you want to build websites together you can do that right so you're part of that actually live Community um yeah so those other resources right like Udacity is great but it doesn't offer you that personal Community it doesn't offer you that accountability at least not for cheap at the very least it's $200 per month and it still doesn't have live sessions with you okay so this course is only 97 and it has a monthly payment plan as well for three months which you can spread out your payments and it has those sessions which Linda doesn't offer which Udacity doesn't offer which which udemy doesn't offer which code academy doesn't offer so uh it has things which are actually not offered by all these uh other places and you guys get them if you get it you lock get in at the current price and then any new content is yours okay let me take on some more questions um James says if we purchase the program without the slack private group can we add that on later uh James I mean that's not something that I want to be doing all the time because what I want to do is just have all the people in slack at once because when newer people join then the older people who are already there they're like who's this person like they got to you know you're just kind of new to the crew what I want to be able to do is just everybody's kind of like tight and honed in and working together so send me an email James um and if you can email me by tonight and join in tonight then yeah sure we'll add you into the slack group okay but I think after tonight I'm not sure if I'm going to be allowing people to join in separately to the slack group okay it's just I want people to be on the same page I want to you get you I want you to get to know your community around you interact with everybody inside right enjoy and have fun and build things together what will be the cost of the new course simar asks in um on Facebook the cost of the course is $97 AKA two private lessons at $50 an hour and you make your money back AKA one private uh lesson at even 20 bucks an hour and in 5 hours you get your money back okay so I love the idea of getting return on my investment for example I bought this crazy course right um it's called ztl uh you know it's called yeah zero to launch okay it's about business and it was a $4,000 course so the whole time I'm like okay all of these skills I'm learning from it how can I use it to get a return on my investment because these things are an investment right you're taking that initiative to invest in yourself you're saying okay I'm going to take this step I'm going to take this decision to improve my knowledge to make a commitment and to actually move forward like for example when I would take a corsera course I could have taken it for free and then paid for the certification but anytime I took anything for free I never made the commitment and I did not stick with it sure there were a few courses which I took for free and stuck with them like uh I think Udacity enter the computer science and whatever but when I paid for a course for corser I was like holy crap like I've paid for it I better stick with it so it's just that one more boost that helped me stick through it okay for you guys it might be a different boost right maybe you you can do something else to hold yourself accountable or have your friends hold you accountable for taking actions but it's just important to make a decision and then take action right like just Dilly dallying and being lazy and taking time procrastinating is a dangerous place to be wi says should I still do intro to programming Udacity win 30034 if you are at my course in Learn Python oop sure you can supplement Udacity great if you want to do that supplement your knowledge you have extra time totally cool awesome all right take on more questions should I learn Java or python to be an app developer python I think it's the world's greatest language people will disagree but that's what I think and here's why I've said this multiple times but one onethird of Google was written in Python okay so like one of the major languages involved in Google is python Instagram with 450 million people in growing platform written in Python Pinterest written in Python okay I've mentioned this multiple times already YouTube is actually a lot of it is written in Python so python you can use at a very like basic level to make like cartoon games to working in NASA doing big data analytics handling pedabytes of data okay or doing machine learning algorithms at Amazon which recommend to you stuff that you couldn't even think about in your own head you're like how does Amazon know me so well or how does Netflix know me so well I didn't even think of this and they're suggesting this to me right so python general purpose language but a very strong language and what I love about it is you could be a 10yearold or a 9yearold and understand it it reads so smoothly and easily and then you could also um take it to the next level and work at you know NASA or somewhere very complex like one of my friends actually works at Google his name is Ben marks I'm uh probably going to do a live interview with him uh for you guys so we can record it talk so that that would be really cool but yeah I mean python it's an allpurpose language what qualifications does one need to become a freelance contractor you don't need qualifications I I I see people saying that a lot and especially now that I run my entire business I rarely hire people that have um like cred like I don't care about credentials yes credentials matter but what matters more is what you can actually do right if I'm hiring you I want to look at your um like I I want to see what kind of return on my investment you can bring me I don't care about how cool your algorithms are I care about what kind of applications have you built and if it's in line with what I want and I can see a return on my investment I want to hire you it's a nobrainer for me okay so that's one of the things I emphasize in my course is that we build real applications okay we just had another person join super cool um I might actually call out your guys's names so what I'm going to do is how do I do this I do I open up my Gmail or something yeah all right so I'll try to call out your name and if it's you um cool that's really cool actually here's what I'll do anybody who joins in this YouTube session just send a little comment to uh you know kiat Clover program.com or just say it in our slack Channel or wherever you can reach me you know just say uh once you get the course just say I I I was in your YouTube Stream So when I have that oneonone Master call with you oh by the way I also give you a oneonone Master call how cool is that Master call where we actually discuss your strategy for the next 3 months of what you're going to be doing so you spend 15 minutes with me and we figure out what we're what you're going to be doing for the next three months like that's powerful right that's value you get some crazy value if I could if you could figure out your plan for the next three months I mean that's awesome that's part of the course and if you join and you say something about you were in this YouTube stream uh you know I'll I'll probably throw in like extra 10 minutes for you guys okay so I want to give you guys a little bonus for being here for being the action takers that you are love it hey Sam I got Facebook Facebook is baby compared to the YouTube like we got 52 people on YouTube and we got five people on Facebook Sager hi all right Rahul says can we use debit card for payments Rahul yes you can just select the PayPal option if you select the other option which is um that other option is only for credit cards so there's a button when you go to the page says PayPal you can just pay with PayPal PayPal handles debit card credit card PayPal whatever else okay you can also go the threemonth payment route whichever one you prefer but uh the one of the most exciting things about this course is like being able to get that slack Channel like I would have killed for a community like that because let me give you a little bit of background like what had what has helped me learn at literally 10 times the rate of other people around me where I was able to charge more like two to three times more than even my mentors who have been uh doing software consultant work for like 20 years okay one thing that has helped me is being able to connect with really smart people okay um my number one skill okay is being teachable I'm not like intelligent or whatever like I'm not there's nothing that special about me okay um I'm a bad student in school I was terrible at math but I got pretty damn good at programming and the reason is one I developed a passion for it and just loved it so I was able to get through everything ever because it was just fun for me right isn't there something you love so much that you can have pain or hardship or obstacles and you just overcome it because you just love it so that's really what was going on with me and I was able to go on like meetup.com and I got super lucky because so many people try to network and they like meet random people and nothing just connects for them for me I was connecting and I ended up finding my mentor his name was Nick oh my God like he helped me accelerate like years Beyond years Beyond um in a very short amount of time and he would give me these personalized tasks and like this laser focused stuff to do and I would literally get good like this that was awesome uh Omar Pasha just joined Zang Zang just joined Kevin Navar just joined Ahmed karesi just joined I think I think it might be safe to say it's pretty lit up in here um awesome excited to have you guys okay so as I was saying what was I saying mentors uh yes so for me that has helped me a lot and then just being able to collaborate with likeminded students I used to go to this place called PS1 it was a coworking space so I think I got a membership I can't remember I think it was $150 a month and essentially you go there and you just cowork so I just wanted to find likeminded people there it was very difficult I found like maybe one or two people and it helped a lot because they were where I was and then they wanted to go where I wanted to go so it really helped us focus and work together and then my mentor would come in once in a while and then give me that boost and accelerate my skill set unbelievable okay so again something I was paying I think $150 something like that per month and for you guys if you join the slack Channel if you join the course and you join the slack Channel which is $47 we have a 100 plus students in the slack Channel like focused dedicated who want to take their career to the next level collaborate with them okay if you do decide to join okay please don't be one of those people who's just going to like sit there and do nothing take advantage of that use everybody around you like use them so you guys can do stuff together you can start your own app together you can build a website together you can like everybody want everybody who's in here wants to be doing something and if you can hold each other accountable and move forward I mean I personally think that's incredibly exciting I don't know about you guys all right um cs50 is Amazing Alex I'm uh cs50 is really cool I absolutely love it yes it's a good course it's for C uh but again the live community that slack channel is not there forums are there and forums are like I just hate them because you'll type in something and then you have to wait like days or something to get an answer and you can't really connect with people this is very different because you can you can just communicate with everybody you can like you can just text message me instantly right you can reach me instantly you can't do that at cs50 you can't reach that guy who's doing cs50 okay uh and then once in a while like I'm very asked with my responses so I'll even like send you personalized V videos to answer your questions okay if I'm feeling if I'm in the mood otherwise I'll answer your questions through message really quickly all right cool we had another person joined Nicholas Cardona all right thank you Rachel for posting the PayPal Link in the Facebook Chat super cool we love Rachel if you guys want to make uh Rachel's life very miserable is like just enroll in the course and then she'll have she'll have to do so much work to enroll all you guys in manually Stephanie Lynn Chandler says it is hard to get off your site sometime uh didn't think I'd get into it so much programming is a world of its own it's beautiful it's magnificent when I'm programming I'm literally in My Own Zone like I wish I could have you here with me right now like what is this like I get my coffee okay I put my coffee down I'll like be sipping slurping on my coffee I'll be like writing my code I'll have my headsets in I like don't want any distractions so generally I would go work at night and uh so that way I don't have any distractions I could just focus and learn and I was logging in crazy days I'm talking 10 15 20 hour days that was also another one of my reasons to accelerate so fast and I just want to be clear guys when you get into this course I'm going to be doing everything I can to help boost you and to hold you accountable okay everybody else in the community is very driven but your success is your responsibility okay so I don't want people who who are like I'm look they're looking for some kind of magic bullet or they're looking for some kind of instant solution to their problem without any effort okay expect hard work expect to put in work ex expect to be involved okay like those things are actually your responsibilities they're not my responsibility they're not somebody else's responsibilities we will be there for you I will be there for you we're going to be in the slack Whatever Whenever you guys communicate we'll get back to you you know we'll constantly be adding new things to this course but you have to go through it right I don't want it to be one of those where you throw it in you know your trophy cabinet or whatever and then you just like don't do anything with it I do that on em me I'll go and just like buy like 20 different courses and just not even watch any of them so this course's whole job is to not be one of those because there's going to be constant involvement I'm going to send you personalized emails where I'm going to have special videos for people who join these are exclusive videos for nobody else outside okay I'm going to have special tricks and tricks and strategies for you guys whether it's for software Consulting negotiation skills tactics you know scripts for example for for some of you guys who joined the webinar who joined the webinar uh I said I'm going to share with you if you buy my course in that time I was going to share with you my $20,000 Craigslist ad a a post that I made that generated me TW over $20,000 in two months okay and let me tell you about these two months it was May and June of last year and I visited California I worked remotely I was with my brother we went to mount Baldi Had the Time of Our Lives went on a freaking ski lift and that was really cool it was like snowing I think it was like May and June and on the top of the mountain when we went there it was like snowing so super cool like literally cool like Frozen um no I I meant it like just cool and then I just did a word play and that was an unbelievable experience like I had a lot of fun and then I went to see my nephew and the only reason I was able to do all those things was cuz I had a job where I had clients I was on I was My Own Boss You Could Be Your Own Boss if you have your multiple clients right treat yourself as a business don't think of your employers as employees or employers think of them as uh clients right so you have multiple of those and now you're not reliant on anybody for me the idea of a 9 to5 job is not safe at all like that's just one job but you have 20 clients you're safe if one goes away you don't care you have 19 you can get another one more right you care about them but the beauty is that you get to focus on like not only do they get to be selective about you but you also get to be selective about them so imagine a life where you get to pick your own clients where you get to travel on your own right on your own command at any time for you guys what is it mean for you guys what would it mean to be financially like free right what would you guys do with that Ivo Ivanov I'm going to answer your courses and clever programmer are one of the few understandable for beginners thank you KY great work you are very welcome I'm glad you said that I'm going to answer I'm going to now look at some more unbiased questions Zane mik how long ago did you start study python Patrick says Patrick called me Zay mik that is a compliment Patrick I will take that compliment and I will wear my hat it's Hat Time guys all right 3 hours and 46 minutes remaining oh and best of all here this is a m mic drop moment so I'm going to not going to drop my keys I'm just going to drop my wallet so here mic drop moment okay you guys ready if you guys are ready let me know in the comments the course starts immediately okay if you join now the course starts immediately like the course content is already there we're only going to get new content yes you can still sign up cunder says I don't have any experience in programming should I still sign up yes uh if you want to of course like read about it you know don't just join cuz I'm saying it like do your own research but once you join and if you're on the border line and you're like I want to join but I want to join later well here let me give you a nobrainer the price is going to go up okay like it I know this course's value is way higher than $97 but because like all of you guys get to come in right now and we get more people and we kind of like build this course and make it even better together like that is exciting to me that is that should be exciting for you guys as well but later on the price of this course is going to go higher so if you're kind of on the fence I would suggest looking into it now so you're not paying a higher price now another nobrainer for you guys okay 30day moneybag guarantee um here my my money back is a my money back guarantee is a little bit different okay it does it's not normal here's how it works okay now I want you guys to take me seriously so I'm going to take my hat off if you don't like the course for whatever reason you're unhappy you're like KY you got really ugly you don't look like xan mullik anymore or I'm just not resonating with your course and it's not helping me you just tell me okay in my slack Channel or you tell me in you know in the 30 days you tell me on um in on my email number one I'll cry okay first step number two I'll call you to apologize that this course wasn't right for you number three I'll refund you right away okay no questions asked and then number four I'll actually take my time out of the day to give you a one oneonone one hour long session personal coaching session that's how much I stand behind my course okay if you were in Chicago I would come visit you in person to meet you Hwang says says how do you delete that comment that you just post H kuang I wouldn't be deleting comments I wouldn't be posting comments that I want to [Laughter] delete J di says sha please say please say or JD sha says please say hi hi Hi how are you doing sham says if I get a certification from Harvard on etex is it as valuable or not I mean that will it give me a return on my investment your return on invest M does not and I repeat does not come from you passively learning collecting certifications and doing nothing about them you know how I know because I have like all the certifications on Cera and eics and free Cod camp and all of that stuff okay your return on investment comes to you when you get your ass out of your chair and hustle and find work that's really what it is and I will show you that and I will teach you that but that's really where it comes from okay yes your skills will always matter but one of the biggest mistakes I see people making especially in the engineering world they're like our skills are so good that we're not going to go out and uh help anybody we're just going to expect everybody to come to us okay okay we're just going to let everybody flock to us big mistake my friend yange she says Mr mull please give yangi a shout out so Yang yangi uh she was actually on the webinar today I don't know if you guys remember that she came uh when everything went to chaos that was kind of exciting I have fun when there's chaos and she absolutely uh you know killed it what she did is she watched one of our free videos at clever programmer okay literally free video It's called four ways to make more money starting today and you know what she did that was different than 99.5% of the people want to take a guess she took action it's as simple as that sometimes she decided to take action and follow through instead of passively watch because you know like I told her 99.5% of the people you can give them all the advice in the world they'll just sit there and take it and just be like yeah yeah that makes sense I knew that yeah okay the I knew it syndrome I hate it with my guts people who say I knew it I hate that word like if you if you could take my number one skill from me and steal it okay you know what it would be it would not be um intelligence or math Wizardry because that's not required for programming but you know what it would be would be my skill to be teachable like literally I can I can be a sponge I just shut up listen and learn Stephanie says that's the worst yep I agree Stephanie that's the worst the I knew it syndrome like these people just like ah yeah I knew it sometimes even if you know just shut up and don't say anything you'll and really let those words sink in you'll be surprised the effect they have on you Devin says you Bulls fan I don't watch so I don't watch basketball I watch soccer I love soccer I play soccer yeah the Samba Soccer oh that's hilarious his name is the Samba Soccer whose question I'm about to go to how much will the price go up I want to learn code and I want to be a part of what you're doing but I only have had two days to think about spending $97 Samba Soccer let me make it really easy for you yes you have two days to think about well well you actually have I think if you look at the time right here you actually only have three hours left to think about it but here let me make it very simple in 30 days if you don't like it you refund okay so you get to you get to kind of try it out and learn those things okay and and see if it's right for you but I totally get it you're like I don't know if I should make this investment or not and you're not ready sometimes you're not ready to pull the trigger that's okay um I'll still be here 99% of my material is free still gives you amazing results like for example I got distracted by Yang she watched one of the videos took action and went in one day or in three days 72 hours from having $13 an hour job to having multiple 50 plus an hour clients $13 an hour here to $50 an hour with multiple clients in 72 hours my hand is not even in the screens anymore that's how much of a that's the Boost that she got okay and you know yeah so apply yourself her return on the investment of watching a free video at clever programmer this month is going to be $800 just this month extra just extra income okay extra income she's only working like just a few hours extra and what's her work she's going to be like doing table tennis lessons or something fun okay and even if it's a chemistry lesson or whatever but she applied those strategies and she landed you know multiple clients so that return on the investment I mean what is that how do I say that Infinity right I mean my calculus isn't the strongest but I have taken Cal 1 2 3 and differential equations and advanced mathematics which I don't use any day the the biggest thing I use is algebra nowadays they tell you you're going to use math but you really don't and then you just use libraries I use libraries and I teach PhD students I have Master students who I'm helping and able to teach why cuz I love programming and you can too like I'm just telling you this not to brag but to literally tell you that there is nothing special about me okay and you can get these same results you can get even better results by just being persistent okay how I became top 1% in the world for chess was here's the hack I replaced Netflix with tutorials ultimate hack Netflix with tutorials music car driving commuting time music with audible cunder says I am signed up thanks kazzy cunder did you sign can I get your Craigslist stuff cunder when did you join if you join now if you join now you don't get the Craigslist stuff you you get it in the webinar Stephanie asks how much do you suggest you charge uh for your first client Yang Yang is on point she just started audible she is like increasing her income like exponentially I love it Stephanie good question let me answer that right now okay for you so for your first client I'm kind of crazy I'm really aggressive with my Approach but like if you're if you're like if you're medium comfortable with what you're teaching and you're like teaching somebody who's one step behind you you can start off at $50 an hour okay um that's kind of like an expected rate if you want to play it safe go maybe 35 or 40 but don't disrespect yourself okay understand your value and if you're helping somebody solve their problem then it doesn't matter what what you're charging okay I know some of us have that pain and it hurts to charge more but my biggest thing that I tell people is charge uncomfortably High when it makes you uncomfortable that's you're charging the right price okay that's really what it is what Udi courses did you enroll into Billy nir asks me oh my God man I enrolled in some like programming courses for like python long time ago um oh my God and they're so I don't want to say they're bad but they're like bad because uh they're made by a software developer who like didn't make them with love wanted to make money and just like went and just shot it in like one ghost boring screencast they don't try to like make it exciting Udacity makes it exciting they have a production budget like their V their video quality is High I mean so it's cool and it's nice to watch them but udem is like G yeah so I have I have some reading courses I learned about Bitcoin from you to me and uh I think I made like $99,000 in like a few months doing Bitcoin stuff I really got into it so I you know I had my family like invest in it when I was younger I was like 16 and I started like learning about it and then you know we made trades it was so freaking scary um it was literally so scary doing stuff with um uh with Bitcoin and like getting my family involved cuz I was young and I didn't really have that much income and I got my family to invest like 15 or $20,000 and I was like handling everybody's money and I was like putting it in a certain exchange I picked it up from udem me and literally all I did was replace Netflix with uh you to me so like it didn't affect my social life it didn't affect like I still got to go out I still got to have fun still got to meet with my friends like that's what I'm talking about these are really simple hacks you can apply um and just really take it to the next level can I pay for the course in Bitcoin steam do says no you can't I'm sorry I wish I used to do that a lot but I stopped doing stuff with Bitcoin how long have you been mining oh you ask somebody I I used to do Bitcoin mining as well that was really cool like I had my laptop sitting there and it was generating money I thought that was was crazy I was like what is this um yeah and then like really crazy stuff happened it was really intense it's a long story I'm not going to go into it but um my heart was beating like crazy especially the last few days but I got out on the profitable end if my family actually didn't freak out the Bitcoin actually went down to $200 and they got scared and they wanted to leave and I told them don't and if they didn't they took that loss and they wrote it out right now it's at $1,200 or $1,000 or something I'm pretty sure so that's 5x so them investing $115,000 we would have been sitting at what $75,000 right so sometimes it's like you know you got to write it out a little bit Alexander Sanchez Mustafa Mustafa is my brother uh he's the reason why I started my YouTu YouTube channel um he gave me huge motivation so I am humbled that Mustafa you're here and in my channel this guy's crazy he has two YouTube channels with like 20,000 subscribers and it's unbelievable and just thank you for helping me start mine Alexander can I pay for the course yes you can pay for the course now my friend uh 3 hours left 3 hours and 31 minutes you can pay for it now the deadline will be up in 3 hours and 31 minutes and no I won't be sneaking in anybody through the back door I mean when it's done it's done like you just miss the deadline like if you woke up five minutes late and missed it you just missed it that's that's just all it is because that otherwise I'd be be unfair to 10,000 students enrolled in clever programmer um what libraries and Frameworks are using so again my whole idea is not to be one of those udemy courses that just like that person is already a software developer with 20 years of experience so he just like goes through the entire course doesn't care about you and what happens is you follow him and you copy his code and you feel like a big boy or a big girl and then you sit and stare at a blank screen you're just like scratching your head and you're like what the hell is this like I can't even write one line of code uh but then you like try to impress your friends and say hey look what I made which you make you followed and you just like yeah so I stay away from that okay Frameworks and all that stuff you'll learn them they're super easy but I gave you fundamentals so you're ready to BR build all of this stuff on your own that's really what I want to focus on I don't want to focus on other things We'll add the other things okay don't worry about them Aaron cut back cuu back joined just a little bit ago let's see Devon Mitchell no Elena Lazarus joined great cool yeah guys we're manually enrolling everybody because what I said is so you see how on Clever program.com o another person is joining I'm gonna call him out sikander Khan just joined welcome buddy I just got you he just joined from Facebook I got Facebook going I got YouTube going it's crazy it's lit up in here so keep here okay anyways let me let me answer some qu Yeah so basically what we're trying to do is um if you join any clever program.com course it automatically enrolls you right you're in this course once you pay for it we enroll you uh we enroll you manually so don't like freak out like we'll enroll you just in a little bit I personally want to enroll as many people as I can it helps me learn everybody's names I'm kind of weird in that sense I'm kind of crazy about that so I want to get to know everybody and I want my team to get to know everybody while they're enrolling you so yeah it might take an extra second but I just think it's really freaking cool cuz then everybody's on board and we all kind of know each other including the team at clever programmer like I just I don't think many people do that and they really get to know you guys and I feel like we get to know you guys and it's cool and then it's really funny also cuz then Rachel is like screaming and she's like oh my God so many people are joining and I can't keep up and I can't enroll every everybody so I I mean it's just kind of funny and I think um uh you guys you know you guys should do that make her life miserable all right greatest ever python instructor I read automate you're boring Stu with python for another programmer but just a fancy title No reality unlike your videos are great dbf another person just joined nice Timothy Samson where is Timothy Timothy all right Timothy where are you I don't see Timothy anywhere oh maybe he's not in here yeah code academy it's like I don't know it just makes me roll my eyes there's a reason why my free code academy course is number one and and here's why it's because um I'm really weird with how I learn woo another join I you guys are you guys are really cool you guys are just a bunch of cool people you guys are just a bunch of cool people uh let me finish my goddamn sentence I'm sorry but I'm G to finish my sentence all right um code academy was what they do well I'm not a huge okay so here's why my course is really doing really good it's really killing it it's because of how I learn and how I think so I'm like really slow to learn something but then the longer I spend in it I learn it really fast so a lot of you guys are really amazing like you guys have no idea but a lot of you guys might not give yourself credit but a lot of you guys can actually learn things faster than I can like you and I will sit down and you'll read a little bit of the book and you'll know it like right away or like you'll remember that part and for me I it won't even like register with me for a long time like it'll take me 5 hours but then the longer time I spend with it the better I get which is why I kind of got killed in school uh in a lot of places cuz it was hard for me to like I'm not I'm not slow I'm fast but like you know there's certain things like chemistry Labs or what whatever I just I'm like not sure what's going on but then I'd spend eight hours of my own time because I'd get so passionate and then I'd have this Insight that nobody else has so that was another kind of part of it and that really helps me another person just joined Sammy Bai welcome so yeah that's kind of what happens you know like um that helps me build my code academy course or all my courses and then what's great is when you guys are learning I just feel like since I'm so slow in learning I ask all the questions you might not even ask so that's why they're so step by step and that's why you can learn all of that stuff so well taking those courses that I'm making so it's like my weird way of thinking actually helps you guys Timothy nice Tim sson says I'm here he's Timothy Samson he just joined uh Sammy Bai just joined again 3 hours 25 minutes to go guys cool good stuff uh good good good stuff Sager you just made my day I love you Sager but you still made my day I'm just messaging him okay so let me see more questions more excitement more awesome Ness been contemplating submitting payment for hours really looking forward to the course hopefully this is what I have been looking for just joined Tyler my friend that is what it's about okay sometimes you got to go I'm about to take that decision boom and go for it okay give it your all if it doesn't pan out you can Retreat right like have some options in the back of your head that where you can Retreat right the 30 money 30day money back guarantee just go like I'm going to go hard for 29 days and if it doesn't pan out yeah I'll I'll I'll I'll return it okay but don't just rely on that fall back plan really give it your go you'll see that you'll get great results in the things that you do so congratulations Tyler like that's it's an investment but it's just awesome that you actually were able to take that step take that initiative and you know and get inside the course because we're excited to have you man we're excited let me see more beautiful I have some Jada Jada Bara love that name Jada Bara says hi I have some basic knowledge in oop AKA objectoriented programming you better not be the I knew it Syndrome guy I will jump on you I have read from read the book from um John zel that you have recommended in your python course and can say I understood it well will this will this your course be still valuable for me I mean I would not be sitting here telling you guys to join it if it's not valuable for you like I'm not here to waste your time I take your time very seriously I take literally I take your time more seriously than I take my time which is why like I think for hours before I go on webinar like I actually have something valuable for you guys again 99% of my material is free go enjoy it learn it like Yang from free material she got th000 she got $800 return on investment just this month in 72 hours just to be clear now imagine what's going to happen this month imagine what's that going to do for the next 12 months if she sticks with the next 12 months we're talking a 12K return on investment of 5 minutes of her time not even any money infinite infinite infinite percentage growth okay so it's possible for you guys right we have some Freelancers we in our course who are Freelancers but then they're actually taking the course getting those Tech skills and then able to charge a higher price right so there are multiple ways you can go about it one of the people at clever programmer actually got promoted right that's cool what's the return on investment on that maybe $20,000 extra like holy that's crazy I mean you're watching free YouTube videos and you just made $20,000 extra per year like in the next 5 years I mean this just humbles me so much I would have helped somebody who just watch a few YouTube videos Earn $100,000 in the next five years what does that mean for them they're able to take out their family to places they're able to hold their head up high and go to any place and do kind of make their own decision without being worried like they need to borrow their money from somebody they don't have to feel like they owe anybody else right how many of us hate that feeling of owing other people's stuff right I hated it that's why ever since I was like 14 one of my friends uh Sager and I owe a lot of my stuff to him because he was one of the first people that actually he got me a chess job I was like 14 or 15 at the time and I didn't have any job and I was about to go into I was going to be a security guard right I didn't know anything and I was like I'm I'm just going to be a security guard it's going to be a cool job CU I get to sleep for like eight hours and it's going to be awesome like I'm just going to make 10 bucks an hour like totally I was disrespectful of my time I didn't respect it at that time right I didn't know any better and he got me this job and I mean he he he wasn't interested in it so he just passed it along but what I did is I just took initiative and I jumped on it and and after that my life changed because it it started my Consulting career before I even knew it because the whole job is like you make they pay you $35 an hour and you go and teach kids I mean they're younger kids they're like 9 10 year olds and seven year olds but like still you're you're doing a public speak every time so that has helped me that's why I'm not nervous when I'm talking to like I'm actually able to connect with you and talk with you and if we were in person I would have a pretty amazing time with you but it helped then like their parents would be there and then we we would have like 50 students sometimes with like 20 parents being able to speak in front of them so again it was like not even about earning at that time it was about learning right he says in Rich Dad Poor Dad um he say something like you know you should be focusing on earning or sorry learning and not earning especially in the start because then you get that exponential growth right because you are not putting in Standard Act you're not doing standard things so you don't get standard results you get like crazy results like a clever programmer people's YouTube channels take four years to get the results this YouTube channel did amazing in three to four months right it was because I wasn't putting in standard uh action people work hard on their videos and they produce one good edited video a day I'm like how about 30 good edited videos a month like I'm sorry they would put one good edited video a month right and I'm like how about 30 good edited videos a month like holy that's just 10x 30X and uh you get yourself in that mindset and you make it happen like it's possible and so really you know that's one thing I want to give you guys is like a lot of it is in here right that like insecurity and all that it's going to hold you back in a lot of the things you do in your life whether you take this course or not whatever the hell you guys are doing in your life you know don't be insecure like make up your mind and then go go for it give it your all before you kind of look back and try to fall back plans or point fingers and blame other people cuz I want you guys to be successful I want you to be successful okay all right PowerUp says Rachel send me the link please and Rachel did not send him the link it's okay uh we still love you Rachel don't worry guys the link is in my uh description so don't make Rachel overwork herself just kidding KSP in the building that's Kitty guys she's a star student at clever programmer she became so badass by joining clever programmer that she went from knowing nothing she was one of those code cademy stuck in hell rinse and repeat just I'll just do code academy 500 times maybe that'll like trigger something in my brain right didn't work for her she joined clever programmer got good results and now she has has her own website it's called The Savvy coder.com and she's even posting blogs like that's cool that's success when she goes her to her employee or her employer they're going to see that and they're going to like she's not going to have to sit there and negotiate price they're going to be like what what do you want right so once you put in that effort those are the results you get they're very nonstandard results they're exponential results right so uh yeah all right the course is amazing go freaking enroll uh ESP says shafik says I'll join now now now if I get that email I'll announce your name it's all about now baby now or never it's 3 hours and 16 minutes from now or never um if things trigger right with you you get that instinct like it it's it's cool right it it uh you like it then don't K the Kazi hop yes I am that is indeed you just witnessed the Kazi hop that was pretty weird Sunny Torres in the building now we're getting some OG students these are like the the original Squad of clever programmer we just got another person to join woohoo what the hell Sony Sony Torres just joined Oh shoot that's really hilarious because uh Sony Torres was on the fence for like eight three months and he was working oneonone with me I don't know why it took you so long to join sunny you were doing oneonone with me it cost you so it costs you so much more and you get 10 plus hours of recorded content you get live sessions I'm there the whole team is there get to network with people let me reframe a few things for you guys to work with a professional you know like uh you know to work with somebody who's professional in this field you're generally paying them between 50 to $150 or $250 an hour or more I was paying one of my mentors back in the day $75 an hour and that was one hour it was invaluable but that was just one hour of her time why I would pay her that much was cuz I would have a problem she would solve it I would have a problem she would solve it and I'm like whatever I'll pay her if you get that for one payment of $97 you get t 10 plus hours premium content recorded you can pay you can play it at your own Pace you can watch it wherever you are $75 an hour to 10 plus hours of videos for only $97 you also have live sessions you can also collaborate with other students one of my favorite things is like you get stuck at some stupid thing it'll take you three hours to get past it but you go in the slack channel right our slack Channel and you post something we are ninjas we will be right there and tell you like no you're being you're being dumb delete that thing and then the something that took you 6 hours and you were stuck on now it took you 30 seconds and you've moved past it so those are just few of the things that are pretty unbelievable like it'll get you much faster results cool we just got another enrollment all right cunder says hash best best decision ever # Freedom yes okay you put in the effort and we can get you results okay we this course will get you results I think I think honestly um if you're interested in programming like not only is it a great investment I just like I'm trying to be really unbiased here and I'm thinking like if I was on the side of you guys and I was trying to join like for me it would be like a nobrainer cuz I would think okay like I do this and then I'll like have two sessions with people back in the day then I get my money back and then I just get like extra time doing this and then the skills I learn here apply and make more money that's what I've always done I would take these online courses immediately apply them to my current jobs or like look for opportunities that required those skills so then basically I was earning while I was learning so one cool thing you can do while you're taking this course is you can immediately the things you're learning here right let's say I teach you how to build an app immediately go and give somebody a lesson charge them and help them build a similar app that will one hone your understanding of this make you an expert and two you get to give somebody else results and then obviously three money is just a symptom of you doing something right okay so then obviously they're going to pay you they're going to be like cool you just helped me with something really awesome this course is not going to be deleted after tonight I think Au oh yeah no not deleted that would be horrible I would not delete this course but what happens is that the course is locked after the deadline so no new people can register that's what happens Sunny yeah air horns exactly ah says another person just joined oh man I better start calling out these names man I'm so sorry all right here okay ton oh wait hold on Toya Williams just joined Toya Williams where are where you at um Josh Josh mow just joined Josh mow and Alexandro PR just joined alesandro PR just joined I think I just went really native there even though I'm not native okay more questions from you guys Sunny says hey I wanted to I want I I don't think it's a question but I'm going to read it anyways I wanted to learn Financial modeling and data manipulation first and then learn how to integrate into Apps but I want to learn how to integrate the two now so this is what I mean like he wrote this big question and because I read it out loud I didn't really understand it so like I have to read it quietly and like take my time and then understand it it's so weird I don't know how to explain it but once I understand it I start getting a really deep understanding like I start seeing through the page and stuff and like things start changing colors I get like these really weird insights so Sunny wants to do basically data manipulation Financial modeling and combine it into Apps wow okay yeah that would be really cool because um the I mean there are lots of companies that are going to use that uh and are going to need help with that and I know Sunny where you work you have a pretty good understanding of what you're going to be using this for Facebook stream I wish the page would change colors whenever I think deeply but I guess not yeah yeah Yang you got to you got to get at that level yeah I don't know why oh ah I'm so sorry I was about to say something about you oh yeah yeah yeah okay man I get distracted so easily yo no one wants to take the lesson from me I swear to God I'm about to get over there and grab you by the collar and Shake Your Soul yes there are people who want to take a lesson with you I'm serious you're unless you're just some evil human being like some people even like evil human beings we're we're weird people um you are here I'll tell you something uh really weird I'm going to get inside of your head and it's going to hurt hearing it you're using this as an excuse so you don't have to work and you can so you can justify it to yourself mentally and give yourself that leeway that break so you don't have to do it and this is some this is a common excuse you can tell to other people too to waight off what you're doing it's like when people say oh I'm just not I just wasn't meant for like going to the gym really I just wasn't meant for um you know uh I don't know like learning programming no you you you weren't meant for any like you weren't born to do one thing specifically but you can through habit and through time and actually persistent you you can make pretty much anything happen okay so yeah you can definitely you'll have a uh coming back to you you can you'll definitely have people who want lessons from you you just have to persist look for those people and offer them something of value okay if people are really not doing uh want work with you um then you need to work on your uh soft skills you need to actually like go hang out with more people be a more likable person cuz it doesn't matter if you can do programming nobody wants to hire a person they don't like okay so if you're the problem and you've identified that then you need to go and work on your like social skills and just generally like just meet more people hang out don't even worry about programming for a little while it's important like I'm serious it'll help you uh even mon monetarily speaking like MoneyWise is going to help you work with more people cuz again like people work emotionally right you want to work with people who you like uh hopefully Ahad that answers it I'm sorry I came down on you so hard Sam says after this programing is over we should all go to California yes I I I think once we get a few I don't know like I I might want to do like a live event with you guys honestly CU it's a pretty cool community so I might do a live event or I might bring um like what I would actually like to do is some star students who are doing really good I'll fly you out here no problem like I'll fly you out here you can have uh lunch with me we'll hang out we'll go play some pool go bowling catch a movie we'll do like a live interview um and then we'll record it for everybody to see or just do like a live webinar go live in front of everybody I think it'll be cool so I would be very happy to do that Ivo Ivanov says how long it took you for you to actually start developing your own ideas without having language difficulties that's actually a really insightful questions people who are going to be successful ask really like insightful questions so um first of all I want to congratulate you on your question and here's what I want to say about that I started my career I got into the world of programming while one of them is my brother my little brother calling me telling me about Hadoop and saying how college students right outside of college right out of college make $200,000 using Hadoop so that was that was cool but something that really got me interested was I was running my business called uh chess tastic and it was for chess okay so again I play chess competitively I like compete at all levels uh top 1% in the country if not the world and what I did was actually started my own chess business and I had my company and we would offer programs at libraries and schools and all that you know ever since I was a very young like probably 18 19 um I've just always been an entrepreneur like it's just in my blood I can't help it for me it's more risky to think about like 9 to5 jobs honestly it scares me cuz I'm like wait so how do you feel safe there just one client and if they fire you you're like done so how's how's there Security in that but me I always try to have like more clients and then the beauty is that again not only do they get to be selective about you you get to be selective about them and everybody respects each other and U it's just more fun it's a more healthy relationship between the two nobody is anybody's boss right you're like friends essentially and you offer each other value and you bring better things into each other's life okay so um Ivo I started in chess and basically what I was trying to do was I was trying to write this algorithm that scrapes the web and pulls out all the middle schools that have chess programs and not like high schools and not middle schools below a certain grade level and not middle schools that are like religious or not middle schools that don't offer chess programs so I had to filter all this on certain criteria because what I was doing initially was like I would go to Google make a call go to Google type in like a library name um get their number put it in my Excel sheet then I would go to another Google like I would Google another a Library address or a school address and I would put that in my Excel sheet take their phone number put in my Excel sheet and what I was finding out that it was taking me like forever to get that done I was like wow this really sucks like there must be a better way another student good job you guys 3 hours left you guys are you guys are decision maker no my YouTube live stream just died I need need this damn it wow that just made me really sad come on you phone all right anybody want to remind me what I was talking about because I kind of forgot all right Sean says I signed up for a python course yesterday on udem me for $10 to be blunt what does your course offer for $97 how could you charge $97 for your course let me go step by step you build apps in less than 7even days step by step from scratch you're not dependent on looking at your screen your brain going blank by looking at a blank screen you get the tools to build those apps by yourself you're not following just my tutorials and then without me you're screwed the whole idea is to give you these tools so you can build everything you know by yourself as soon as you learn it from me you're able to apply it and do things with it on your own and deviate and go play with your own examples hard to do with some of these online courses that kind of give you this giant thing that you can't do anything about now something more okay than UD me course you get a private community of other likeminded students who are very driven serious dedicated and want to either you know improve their in their career or you can work with them to build a personalized project you can work with them to go and find a new job you can work with them to book new clients you can work with them to start your own freaking business and website that's what I would do if I got together with likeminded people who were driven I would talk with them and I would say hey man or hey girl let's figure it out let's see if we can start something together it could be a website it could be a business we could go book clients we can charge them for certain thing we can build an app together you get that in my course you don't get that at udem me you know what else you get at this course live sessions with everybody so all of you guys are there at least once a month we're sitting in front of each other you guys get to have a mic mic and a camera camera you guys get to talk with everybody you guys get to talk with me that you don't get at uh unim right um what else you get emails from me personalized videos that are only exclusive to everybody in the course you don't get that at em me okay um projects exercises quizzes you get a little bit of that udemy oh here's another thing boring courses on udemy I'm sorry I'm just going to say it boring like screencasts and they're just deathly boring I can't do it like I can't do it um it's so hard for me to go through those courses honestly so yeah you don't have those these are made with heart these are made with love I take a lot of time to craft them and make them so when you guys get something it's truly the best because again 99% of my material is free I I me I just would wouldn't charge if it actually literally wasn't worth your money or your time because I'm not here to waste your time and like I've said I value your guys' time actually more than mine hopefully that answers your uh question coding is similar to math in that almost nobody just naturally picks it up easily I had to start with Elementary algebra in college worked up to B+ in calculus because I really wanted to learn it sorry guys one second um Nick cook just joined Nick cook welcome Rashad ROK just joined welcome if you're here hit me back yep you're welcome Sean um I love that question and you know you're right you have to be blunt and ask the hard questions and those are the questions a lot of people are uh afraid to ask or even to answer so I'm glad that you took that initiative to an ask that question love it how did clever programmer start um long story I'll make it short last year I was going to UIC had this thought of starting this channel um and my routine looked like this every day I would wake up at 530 a.m. exactly I'm not a morning person I changed that through listening to books a book was called 21 sleeping strategies for healthier 21 smart sleeping I don't know it's like long L but it was like 21 something sleeping strategies and um he just talks about how good it is to sleep at 10 p.m. you know you know you get in that circadian rhythm cycle gets your blood flowing better it gets your mind right it gets your energy up uh you can lift better in the morning your appetite is better so then that way you can eat more um your vitamin D levels remain high and just overall your productivity levels go through the roof and it was true that happened with me so I would sleep at 10 p.m wake up at 530 a.m. because that's like I think we I would do four to five sleeping Cycles cuz every sleeping cycle 1 and a half hour so I would sleep 10 wake up at 530 sharp I would um I had everything timed like I would visualize my day the night before and I would do everything step by step like I I would write it down in my Wonder list like get out of bed at 530 uh about 530 a.m. um get out of the basement and step onto the first floor at 537 a.m. get into the shower at like 545 a.m. get out of the shower at 600 a.m. get uh get done eating breakfast at 630 a.m. 620 a.m. by like what you can measure you can change okay it's really important write it down what you can what you can measure you can change okay so by measuring this what was happening was I was getting very efficient and mindful of everything uh because sometimes you'll realize you'll be taking a shower and you'll just take 2 hours for no reason or you'll like be talking to somebody and you'll just take 50 minutes talking and by letting that time leak that's what happens where at the end of the day you're like I'm just so busy and then you look back at your day and you're like I went to a job and then that was it so why am I so drained and why am I so like why can't I do anything so again 530 a.m. I would wake up I would like you know read read a book in the morning I would go to the gym I would get done lifting I would get to the go to the train in the train I would read books and then I would go to college I would go to work and then any time I got which was very little I would have my day planned and I would just produce videos like I had planned okay so I would just do that every time just did it for many months consistently nonstop I was like a little Annoying with how crazy I was about it right with that system and then just got pretty good results so that's kind of you know how it went not every day was perfect not every day I slept at 1000 or woke up at 530 like you know it changes but my main priorities were like I have to get this done and I would just try to get that thing done like YouTube video every single time and then it started picking up you know you guys paid attention you guys enjoyed it and uh you guys brought your boy on deck and made this a reality okay my why is my phone so stupid it's just dead all right I yeah I was also answering your question I'm very sneaky with no I mean I'm not sneaky but I just you know brain works weird it's slow but once I'm in I'm like I catch everything so I saw your question and I wanted to uh you know kind of answer that too all right Kitty peace out good night if you want to start a YouTube channel start it like it doesn't it's not any you know extra extra work or whatever you can just kind of get started um it just takes effort and it just takes time like that's what it is it's most people get discouraged without seeing results and one of my extreme skills is that I I'm very crazy about implications of things so like when I see when I saw 20 cents when I was doing Bitcoin mining I was like if I scale this that's like thousands of dollars and most people can't see that like most people just see this this this computer just sitting here making 20 cents what the hell can I do with 20 cents but what they're not thinking is like this computer is sitting here literally nobody's doing anything extra and it's just generating money now what if I scaled it and what if to increase my profit margin I found out ways where the electricity cost was lower or the maintenance cost was lower what if I could like host it in a cloud what if what if I could like get a service now it's scalable right but people don't really people see the first thing and then they're kind of stop and that's what happened and that's what kept me going right so when I would see one subscri subscriber every day I was like Wow before there was Zero subscribers now it's one subscriber every day I mean so I and I also make my goals really small every time like sure I want to be at the level where I have six packs but if your goal is that you'll quit the next day so what your goal has to be is a little bit different for example when you go to the gym your goal should just be hey I'm going to increase uh incrementally so uh 2 and2 lbs extra on each side so 5 lbs I'm going to increase my S on my deadlift I'm going to put 10 lb extra on my bench I'm going to put this many pounds extra right and then you get your form right you get your squat you know you got your squat right you focus on the little goals in between you trick your mind you make those goals really important but the whole time you're actually going towards that bigger goal but you don't let your mind think about that because your mind is very easily tricked it just goes oh but the sixpack but I don't have it and I just quit so you have that that long goal in your head you tell your brain to shut up you set these middle and small goals and then you follow them and you enjoy those goals and you make make goals that are all follow like deliverable actionable right like your goal shouldn't be how can I start a $2 million business I'll go to like a vcn pitch you're going to you're just you're setting yourself up for failure how about how can I do something where people pay me 5 cents okay now how can I take it to 10 cents and how can I take you 20 cents scale it systematically improve it test it ask somebody to pay you $10 and then go hm I just went from 50 cents to $10 by just asking or if they say no you're like hm maybe I can go lower so you know a lot of these things are very systematic have these small goals that you set up and then follow them through you'll get to your ultimate goal but you won't get to your ultimate goal if that's the only thing you're following cuz you don't have any little motivational snacks in between the the motivational snacks that should actually be a quote um okay so let's see mwanza just joined that's awesome by the way when you guys join I have it set up so like oh I have it programmed so it tweets out your like name on my Twitter and says you joined so that's cool then I also get a text message that you join and I also get a phone call and the automated voice tells me your name so all that's done through programming so power of programming is really damn cool your nickname should be kamakazi because you're killing it in a good way awesome I'm getting another call somebody else just joined let's see who it is awesome so a friend shafik a friend Shake just joined who is that if if you're here show yourself muanza muanza ryes are are you guys actually joining this from the face uh what's it called the YouTube group or the YouTube live the book suggestion I have is John zel's book I think it's great it's called intro here I'll show you see what you get with me is I am not a preacher I am a practitioner so this is the book it's called John zel's um Python programming book great book so that's the book I would recommend okay I love this course uh ah you can't join um I don't know I don't know when I will make this course available again so right now it's what March and it's closing down right around April so April May June July I don't know maybe it won't be open in July or maybe it will be I have no idea because we're going to go through this thing called Sprint with you guys where we're going to rehaul the course together and it's going to be customized basically for you I mean what other course gives you weekly checkins right so we're going to do that and um we hold you accountable I take your surveys I take those questions to hone the course to what you actually want cool another person just joined Sean hetel just joined welcome welcome Sean hetel super excited to have you on board yeah I we have weekly checkins with you guys as well okay um and again if you wait till July which is totally okay just just know I just want you to know because I don't want you to be upset later on is that the price of this goes Much Higher by the time I relaunch the course okay because it's just going to have most of you guys are going to have awesome results I have no doubt of it and that alone will increase the price of the course because there have been people who have tested it and it's been great for them right so then I will be looking for even more serious students who are willing to join the program and really take their skills to the next level how can you join this course my link is right here um I'll just put it at the top for you guys C here to join uhoh it won't let me do that there you go so you can join this course by clicking that uh link hopefully and uh I'll put that link in the chat box for you guys as well okay if you click that link if you click that link you will get it my accent I was born in Pakistan then I moved to United States and and uh yeah I don't know what kind of accent I have I really don't that's why I guess it's so hard Thor Suri kazy do you know a good C++ course for free cs50 pretty damn good it's C uh but once you learn C you learn everything C++ too so when I was learning it cuz I wanted to learn C at some point or and or C++ sorry and I was like there were there are no good courses for C++ that kind of sucks so I learned C and then yeah it's C++ is not much different I just picked it up pretty fast nice sahad great um guys I'll be right back watch an at or something chill out I'm going to go grab some water kind of dying over here but I'm excited so let me grab some water let me walk around for a second and uh I'll be right back based on complex criteria what for all right guys I will be right back I will get some more Diet Coke for you guys for for e e e e e e e for e what hello hey guys what's up welcome back hey Matias okay Matias so let me answer your question he says I was going to sign up but then I found out I have to pay an extra $46 and it's actually not 46 it's $47 you have to pay extra or something for full access Community which was a bit disappointing so Matas was disappointed because he had to pay more let me put it this way this should not be $47 for onetime payment it should actually be $47 a month because that's the kind of community you guys have so if you get this community for extra $47 and you can even I don't know land a job where you can work for $50 an hour that's like one hour of your time and you make it back so yeah it's a little bit more expensive but there was a deadline that I announced to everybody on my email and I told everybody that I think it was on Tuesday the cut off time was Tuesday at 800 p.m. the slack channel uh is actually not part of the course you have to pay an extra 47 to join it so that's really you know where I'm at with that so hopefully that answers your question but I honestly think it's a steal it's a good investment in yourself but hey look if you're not ready or willing to uh go that route right now that's okay um you still will have access to me you'll we'll still have live sessions live webinars right uh we'll still be adding more and more content to this course so keep in mind you're ping $97 right now for potentially a course that's going to be two three four $500 maybe even more so right now you lock it in at the current price if I add future content it's yours to keep if I add new videos they're yours if I have new live webinar and sessions they're yours you want to collaborate with other students sure okay all at the price of $97 thankful is $500 a month College course is $1,500 a month and you don't learn nearly enough the people you're working with at in the class are all confused They Don't Really Care they're not even interested they don't even know what career they want to get into they just happen to be doing programming and you're mixing a crowd of everybody this community is like people who are dedicated to really advance and take themselves to the next level if I put some barriers in front it makes it even a better Community when you guys join because everybody who's in here is making a commitment they're saying we're making an investment they're not here to waste your time you're not here to waste theirs you're really both there to hold each other accountable move forward uh how many have already paid for the community let me tell you 98 just joined uh it's actually more people that have paid for the community some people haven't even joined the community yet uh their enrollments are actually on pause so it's going to be probably 110 115 people in the community it's going to be more here I'll just send you a screen in screenshot of the community so you can see kind of uh what it looks like in here and uh what's going on all right I just took this screenshot right now slack community Community okay take a look at it you'll see that people are posting their code other people are commenting um we'll answer your questions everybody's collaborating with each other so on the left hand side you'll see something called direct messages everybody's able to directly message so you can oneonone communicate with everybody or you can actually just be in one of our channels and then communicate with everybody else that way so it's a pretty transparent Community we over 100 students in like literally by the way um in the last like three days we had over hundreds of students joined our program so you know uh everybody's excited everybody's coming on board uh and they're having fun and I'm you know I just sent you a screenshot of it so take a look at it Matas you have a lot of questions um look if you're not ready that is totally okay again I will answer some of your um you have to take that link Matas and copy and paste it in a URL okay that's how you'll see this link you don't want to pay for it and be there alone you're not alone again I just said you have over a 100 students in there IPL you're not too late to the stream basically the course is closing down two hours left to make the deadline so if you guys are new here you have two hours left to make the deadline in short way what's offered in the course is again stepbystep instructions for you to be able to go from code to making your apps from scratch in Python okay something you can show employers something that you can actually put on your portfolio and charge clients a higher price for uh you'll Master the fundamentals of objectoriented programming so guy graphical user interfac is what you see in front of you click click click everything right otherwise we would be back in 1970s so you'll have that you'll have a live oneonone Master call with me for 15 minutes where we discuss your strategy for the next two to three months we lay down a road map of what you're going to be doing for the next X amount of months so then that way you're very clear with what your priorities are okay so again I think that's pretty valuable and it might be really valuable for you we have live uh sessions so they're called live accelerat hacking sessions where we get together at least once a month and we all connect and we do either coding challenges or like a live uh you know Mack interview or Q&A so questions and answers so you'll get to be part of that you'll get uh emails where I'll send you extra videos or extra uh you know resources and guides you'll have weekly checkins every Monday I'll check in with you I'm going to send out surveys get your guys' uh questions you know I'll email you them and I'll get your guys' opinions on things and suggestions and we'll tweak the course to that that's why it's a 30 to 60 day Sprint so you guys are going to be actually I'm inviting you guys to this so then we can really take this course to the next level together okay so that's really what's going on here uh the link is in the description of this video um oh I sent you the link at the top uh HTTP d. PRI SLX rt4 so I'll put that at the bottom again that's the link okay so uh here's what I'm going to be doing um I'm going to go offline in a little bit and then I'm sure you guys will have a ton of questions you know in the last hour stretch cuz right now you guys have 2 hours and 25 minutes to decide go to the page learn more about the course understand that this is a nobrainer with a 30day money back guarantee you call me I refund you no questions asked I'm not here to nickel and dime you not here to do whatever right but I want but you have responsibility in this course like I want you to actually take I want you to be involved in this course I want you to actually put in work this is not some again magic course we just going to take it and somehow you're going to get better by breathing and watching videos you're going to get better by watching videos but you're going to get a lot better when you actually take the uh you know the like the assignments that are given to you and what you're expected to do once you put in that work you're going to see you're going to be putting in two times of work as usual and you're going to be getting 10 times of results right that's really what I'm trying to do here I'm taking lots of other cor uh you know corsera online mukes and all of that and really making this uh as a best resource that has those things outlined I think in the best way yeah yeah uh IPL great question that's exactly where actually all of these courses are headed right now you're going to make local desktop applications with python and then eventually and the reason is so you don't you don't deal with any of the online complexity cuz when you combine online with an app that makes things very complicated so what we're going to be doing is we're going to only build something local with python we're going to build multiple apps you actually get ideas how it actually works and then I'm going to show you uh how to take it online so then you're not getting confused between connecting those two parts together you'll understand how to develop an app and then you'll understand how to bring it online and all you have to do is just connect the two and then boom your flask app or your Django app is up and running so yeah yeah Jan Tapper I'm sorry quality is definitely better than this morning the webinar that you are at um but yes the sound is not synchronized okay guys so I wanted to answer your questions I wanted to answer your concerns because I understand it's an investment in yourself but that's truly the idea to take this and get that return on your investment immediately because I don't want you to be thinking oh man like I need to really if you're tied up on money don't you know I don't want you to be worrying about that when you invest in this course because you'll not focus on learn you're not you won't be able to focus on learning but that's why I give you so many tools to earn your money back and 10 times more is because then when you actually are in the course you're able to just learn and focus on it and you don't have to worry about anything else because you're already you got your return on your investment you're not like I invested in here do I get anything back do I not get anything back okay so it's really to so you don't have to worry about that my website is not on WordPress my chest tasc.com website was on WordPress because I was not a developer back then and because I realized that I had to use Excel sheets to do everything I realized there had I figured there had to be a better way I ended up hiring a programmer paid him $500 to write a simple script which I'll show you guys in my course to write and you guys will learn it and uh you won't have to pay 500 bucks for it I did because it was helping me with my business at the time and using that script we were able to pull all of the schools middle schools uh that I could actually based on a certain criteria that I could call and book my uh chess sessions with them so because I I had a company for chess tastic and we would you know put our programs in their schools and we would put our programs in their uh libraries as well okay guys so that's it for now we already had a really long session we're at 2 hours and 2 minutes I'm going to let you guys go and I'm going to come back when you guys have one hour left cuz I'm pretty sure you guys going to have ton of questions the link is still here you guys can click that link to check out the course um I think you're going to really enjoy this course there's just a ton of content that's not covered in courses like Linda udem me corsera whatever else right you have that Community you have those live sessions you have uh all these exercises you you have all this accountability people to network with you get those emails to hold you accountable you get those weekly checkins like those things are not offered at all those other places and again thinkful which doesn't even offer all of those things is $500 a month and then other programming boot camps like full stack Academy is $155,000 uh for three months then you have um you know C Udacity courses where you only get feedback and that's $200 a month so really a lot of these options are uh pretty expensive and they still don't give you you all of the stuff that's offered okay so I really want to make this a nobrainer for you guys make it really easy and simple uh but yeah again I'll come I'll uh join Nathan I'm going to be adding new stuff to the Course once it's closed once everybody's on board and starting Monday we'll really be kind of uh adding some new stuff and it'll be really exciting like I'm ex super excited about that cuz we're going to really add new things we're going to build new apps um and we'll connect with each other to make sure that everybody is on track okay so in the start I want to make sure that everybody's on the same page and yeah we'll be adding new and new content to this okay so I would say you know right now it's really hectic new people are joining in every second like even now we have I think a few new people joined uh David radart joined Sean hetel joined yeah cool okay so I'm going to go offline and I will come back in one hour if you guys still have any questions I'll be here for you guys in the meantime check out the course okay guys thank you uh as always I love you so much I hope I was able to offer you value even outside of just telling you about my course because that's really my goal to give you massive and massive amounts of value okay so hopefully you enjoyed this hopefully you learned a few new things and uh just remember you have two hours left um you know sometimes you just got to pull that trigger right you got to pull that trigger but take your time think about it uh just know that the next time this course launches it will be a lot more expensive so if you're kind of on the fense you can join it now try it out in 30 days don't like it you refund or you can join it now and then um bye yeah you can join it now and then you know you'll still have it even afterwards when the price increases you have lifetime access to it okay all right guys thank you so much I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
