00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:03 - clever programmer calm let's jump on and
00:06 - talk about tuples okay this is something
00:10 - we did not discuss in our data types yet
00:12 - and we need to cover this concept so
00:16 - remember when we had lists and you can
00:19 - add things to list and delete things
00:20 - from lists and lists are super nice so
00:23 - you know list would be something like
00:26 - groceries and if you said okay let me
00:29 - turn on this one thing so it does not
00:33 - keep bothering you guys okay all right
00:39 - there we go
00:40 - now remember list was like groceries and
00:43 - you might have a banana and Apple
00:51 - groceries that's funny
00:53 - apricot okay well with tuples you can
00:58 - use them a very similar way you could
01:00 - have let's let's make it something that
01:02 - you can't change for example or you know
01:07 - Social Security numbers I mean you could
01:13 - use whatever you want but I just wanted
01:15 - to use this one and it could be some
01:17 - number here it could be another number
01:21 - right there and then another number
01:23 - right here okay so this here is actually
01:27 - called a tuple why is it call that
01:31 - nobody knows but it's wrapped in
01:34 - parentheses and the main difference
01:36 - between a list and a tuple is that you
01:40 - can add things to a list and delete
01:42 - things from a list but to a tuple you
01:45 - can't change it you can't add things to
01:48 - a tuple or take things out from a tuple
01:52 - so that's really the key difference I'm
01:56 - going to go down
02:01 - and show you ok groceries we can do dot
02:06 - append cheese cheese okay and if I print
02:12 - out groceries here okay and you'll see
02:17 - the results at the Pope this round a
02:19 - different file you can see the results
02:22 - right there it says apricot banana apple
02:24 - and cheese because I just added cheese
02:28 - to it and it shows that you don't have a
02:30 - method like dot a pen for tuples so it
02:35 - can you can do that for them okay this
02:37 - was just a very basic example of this
02:40 - why would you need to use a tuple well
02:42 - if you were working with data that you
02:44 - really never want change like maybe you
02:46 - were storing people's passwords you
02:48 - never want to you want to store them
02:53 - like this because maybe that's something
02:55 - you might now want to change right or at
02:57 - least you might want to make it really
02:59 - difficult for people to change
03:00 - even people who are programming those
03:03 - websites for you or if you're
03:05 - programming a website like that yourself
03:07 - it's really quickly let me show you
03:09 - where you can actually find this code so
03:12 - I'm going to actually push this code up
03:14 - for you guys okay let's see here add
03:22 - learn whoops
03:25 - Python
03:29 - okay so you guys can actually go to
03:34 - github.com okay and look up my username
03:38 - so maybe a clever programmer and one
03:41 - thing you can do is go to users and
03:42 - follow me okay but if you can't follow
03:47 - me just look for a clever program or
03:49 - underscore stuff this repository go to
03:52 - this repository right here and you will
03:56 - see learn Python okay there's the link
03:59 - if you want to go directly github.com
04:00 - slash clever program or slash clever
04:03 - program or underscore stuff and then
04:06 - there you'll see something called learn
04:07 - Python go in there
04:09 - click tuples and you can actually see
04:11 - the code right there and that's where I
04:13 - will let me make it a little bit bigger
04:15 - so you guys can see it better this is
04:17 - where I will try to add the code for you
04:19 - guys from here on out and you guys can
04:21 - just go ahead and check everything right
04:24 - on there okay hopefully that clarifies
04:27 - everything alright that's it in the next
04:30 - video perhaps we're going to cover a
04:32 - little bit more about mutable versus
04:34 - immutable data types so I'll see you
04:37 - guys there
