00:30 - you
00:30 - get notified right away now if you are
00:33 - serious about making money
00:35 - as a developer we do have a link below
00:38 - where you can go ahead and click
00:39 - it's a free training where nods will
00:41 - teach how he was able to make
00:43 - 300 000 in three years as a software
00:46 - developer
00:47 - and how you can too now let's jump into
00:49 - it number one
00:50 - don't do it for the money now
00:53 - here is something that's super
00:54 - controversial because very often you
00:57 - hear people saying like hey you should
00:58 - become
00:58 - an engineer or a software developer
01:01 - because they get paid
01:02 - really well but let me tell you
01:04 - something people that come into this
01:06 - industry
01:06 - because they're trying to do it for the
01:08 - money they're trying to do it for the
01:09 - recognition the prestige
01:11 - end up burning out and don't
01:13 - successfully become
01:14 - software engineers because in reality
01:16 - it's not something that's super easy and
01:18 - simple
01:19 - it's hard it's complicated it's
01:20 - challenging so for you to push through
01:22 - those things
01:23 - you have to make sure you actually enjoy
01:26 - it and you're very passionate about it
01:27 - so if you are doing it for the money let
01:29 - me tell you you're watching the wrong
01:31 - video
01:32 - go ahead go somewhere else go follow
01:34 - your passion go follow your dreams
01:35 - figure out what you actually like what
01:37 - you actually want to go do
01:38 - and go ahead and exit this video but for
01:41 - those who are still here because you
01:43 - realize
01:43 - you're doing programming because it's
01:44 - something you're passionate about you
01:46 - find
01:46 - fulfillment from being a developer let's
01:49 - go ahead and get into number two
01:51 - before i tell you what it is let me tell
01:53 - you this mindset
01:55 - helped to make programming and
01:57 - developing software
01:59 - seem super simple and super easy
02:02 - and this quote took me a long way in my
02:05 - software career this quote is very
02:07 - simple
02:08 - it's not hard it's new now this is so
02:10 - powerful because when i started to get
02:12 - into programming
02:13 - everything seemed really difficult even
02:15 - though i was a logical thinker
02:18 - i was a good problem solver just writing
02:20 - my first piece of code
02:21 - assigning my first variable or even
02:23 - calling my first function
02:25 - didn't make sense but because instead of
02:28 - approaching it in a manner where
02:29 - man this is too hard for me i'm not
02:31 - going to be able to get it
02:32 - i approached it in the manner of this is
02:34 - new it's
02:36 - a skill that i have to build and once i
02:38 - build it it's going to become
02:39 - simpler it's going to become easier i
02:41 - was able to progress
02:43 - rapidly through those plateaus i was
02:45 - able to keep on pushing my career
02:47 - forward i was able to keep
02:48 - on learning more and more and more so by
02:50 - adopting this mindset
02:51 - i switched the frame instead of viewing
02:54 - programming like this impossible
02:56 - challenge that was just hard that i
02:57 - couldn't overcome
02:58 - i viewed programming as a skill that i
03:01 - just had to develop and i just had to
03:03 - spend more time with i had to get more
03:05 - intimate with it and as i got more
03:07 - intimate with it
03:08 - it just became simpler it just became
03:10 - easier to where it almost became like
03:12 - second nature to me now a lot of people
03:14 - look over this but the reality is that
03:17 - becoming
03:18 - a great programmer and becoming great at
03:20 - literally anything else
03:22 - is 80 mental and 20
03:25 - actual skill so if you show up with the
03:28 - right mentality
03:29 - you're gonna be able to dominate the
03:32 - skill set
03:32 - so number three never stop
03:36 - learning you know one of my favorite
03:38 - mentors warren buffett says
03:40 - the more you learn the more you earn and
03:42 - this directly applies
03:44 - to software development as well you want
03:46 - to make sure
03:47 - that you're always pushing yourself
03:49 - pushing what you know
03:51 - trying to learn more if you already know
03:53 - specific stack or framework or language
03:55 - maybe learn another one that has similar
03:57 - applications or different applications
03:58 - but
03:59 - this will allow you to keep challenge
04:01 - yourself keep growing as a person keep
04:03 - growing as a developer
04:05 - and most importantly adopting this
04:07 - mindset will make sure
04:09 - that your career will be sustainable
04:11 - over a long period of time there's been
04:13 - lots of developers that ended up
04:15 - focusing on just
04:16 - one specific language like maybe fortran
04:18 - and where are they now
04:20 - unfortunately not many people are using
04:22 - it what they had to do was adapt over
04:24 - time
04:24 - and that's what everyone has to do as a
04:26 - software developer as you adapt
04:28 - you take on new skill sets and it's
04:30 - crazy because these skill sets start to
04:32 - compound over time
04:34 - and you just get better and better and
04:36 - better so guys as a new developer one of
04:38 - the biggest challenges that you're going
04:39 - to come across
04:40 - is learning how to manage data now this
04:43 - is gonna be important
04:44 - for becoming a developer because
04:46 - everything in the software world
04:47 - is driven through data that's all the
04:50 - software really is is you're showing
04:52 - data in different ways
04:53 - one of the best ways to learn more about
04:56 - data is by practicing
04:57 - immersing yourself in it and even
04:59 - finding the right mentors to teach you
05:01 - about it
05:02 - and that's why i want to talk today
05:03 - about datacamp datacamp is an
05:06 - online platform that has over 300
05:08 - classes
05:09 - that will teach you everything you need
05:10 - to learn about data whether it's sql
05:13 - python and much more languages and tools
05:16 - that you're going to need now in data
05:17 - camp you're going to have the right
05:18 - tools to become an
05:19 - absolute expert because they're going to
05:21 - guide you through their courses and
05:23 - their
05:24 - teachings and here's the great thing
05:26 - it's also mobile friendly
05:27 - so it doesn't matter if you're trying to
05:29 - learn while you're walking your dog
05:30 - using the restroom whatever it is you
05:33 - could do it from the web or
05:34 - from your phone and it gets even better
05:36 - because very often we might be running
05:38 - around because of life
05:40 - this is something that you could do on
05:41 - your own schedule so it doesn't matter
05:43 - if you work in the mornings in the
05:45 - evenings if you don't work at all if
05:46 - you're in school whatever your situation
05:48 - may be
05:48 - you can find the time to learn through
05:51 - these courses
05:52 - learn all the things you need to learn
05:53 - about data so you could become an
05:55 - absolute professional so go ahead and
05:57 - check out this class
05:58 - in python where you could learn more
06:00 - about how to use it to create
06:02 - databases or even then this class in sql
06:04 - so you can learn more how to
06:06 - query databases and get the data that
06:07 - you want when you go through these
06:09 - classes you're going to develop
06:10 - so much experience in the back end
06:13 - because it's all about
06:14 - practicality so if you want to become
06:16 - professional and
06:17 - super good with data and the back end
06:20 - go ahead click the link below and check
06:22 - out data camp where it's only going to
06:24 - cost you 25
06:25 - a month and the amazing thing is these
06:27 - are skills you can develop
06:29 - that will pay back in dividends because
06:31 - if you're able to become a professional
06:32 - you're able to land a job
06:34 - you're going to learn data so well that
06:36 - you'll be able to make so much money
06:37 - that 25 a month
06:38 - will be piece of cake and if you don't
06:40 - get to that point that's only a couple
06:42 - starbucks coffees you don't have to
06:43 - drink so that you could pay
06:45 - for your knowledge and invest into
06:46 - yourself now if you're still
06:48 - on the fence here's the best part you
06:50 - can go over there
06:51 - by clicking the link below and check out
06:53 - every single course's first
06:55 - chapter for free so one thing i see a
06:58 - lot from people
06:59 - pp yes pp practice with
07:03 - patience here's a crazy limiting belief
07:06 - for a lot of new developers they come in
07:09 - thinking that they're going to become
07:11 - these experts in just a matter of 30
07:13 - days in a specific language
07:15 - or specific framework now for you to
07:17 - become a true master of your craft
07:19 - it's gonna take time it's gonna take
07:21 - practice it's gonna take
07:23 - repetition and it's also gonna take
07:25 - patience
07:26 - because this is a long journey of
07:28 - development in fact i
07:30 - clearly remember talking with a lot of
07:31 - senior software engineers back when i
07:34 - was working at blue origin
07:35 - and they themselves never felt like they
07:37 - had it all figured out
07:38 - because they were always pushing their
07:39 - own boundaries and learning just a
07:41 - little bit more
07:42 - and i saw that i was like man if they
07:44 - are 30 years ahead of me
07:46 - i have to be really patient to put in
07:48 - that time and put in that practice
07:50 - to even get to their skill set but i saw
07:52 - that even they're being patient
07:54 - because they're learning new
07:55 - technologies and they're increasing
07:57 - their skill sets so when i put that into
07:59 - perspective
08:00 - i kept practicing my craft i kept
08:02 - building my applications
08:04 - i kept coding as often as possible but i
08:06 - kept
08:07 - patience in mind i wasn't thinking about
08:09 - the next 30 days
08:10 - the next 60 days or the next 90 days i
08:12 - was thinking about the next three years
08:14 - the next five years and beyond when i
08:16 - started thinking long
08:17 - term this became a simpler game for me i
08:20 - wasn't rushing myself i wasn't feeling
08:22 - anxious anymore about getting it done
08:24 - i just fell in love with the process i
08:26 - fell in love with learning more about
08:28 - programming
08:29 - i fell in love with challenging myself
08:31 - and pushing past my comfort zone
08:33 - so don't forget to pp number five
08:36 - get a mentor now guys one of the most
08:40 - valuable precious resources
08:43 - that both i and you and everyone else
08:46 - have
08:46 - is one specific thing time if i could
08:49 - get all my time back that would be the
08:51 - most amazing thing
08:52 - ever this is the most precious resource
08:54 - on this planet because it's something
08:56 - that we're never
08:57 - going to be able to get back until
08:59 - someone creates a time machine but until
09:00 - then
09:01 - we're never going to be able to get our
09:03 - time back so we want to make sure
09:05 - we're using our time properly and that's
09:07 - the exact reason
09:08 - why i'm creating this video for you
09:10 - especially new developer because i want
09:13 - you
09:14 - to take what i'm saying here and this is
09:17 - three years of me
09:18 - being in the field three years of me
09:19 - learning and these are the things that i
09:21 - wish i knew three years ago
09:23 - and even further back so that i could be
09:25 - even further ahead
09:26 - than where i'm at right now so with all
09:29 - that i'm saying is
09:30 - if you get a mentor you're gonna save
09:33 - yourself
09:34 - time because when you have your mentor
09:36 - you're gonna
09:37 - learn what sucks and what's good you're
09:39 - gonna learn what's a waste of time
09:41 - and what's not waste of time you're
09:42 - gonna learn the things that you have to
09:44 - do
09:44 - to hit your specific goals and the
09:47 - mentor speeds up that process
09:49 - we've all heard that it takes ten
09:50 - thousand hours to become an expert
09:53 - and your mentor has probably put in
09:54 - those ten thousand hours plus
09:56 - more maybe enough to fifteen a hundred
09:58 - thousand hours
09:59 - of work on the craft imagine if you had
10:02 - access to that imagine if all you had to
10:05 - do was
10:05 - ask questions and they could give you
10:07 - the answers and they could guide you
10:09 - down the right path step by step and
10:12 - that's exactly
10:13 - what we offer with the clever programmer
10:16 - full stack
10:16 - mastery bootcamp we take you from a
10:19 - complete
10:20 - beginner knowing nothing about code to
10:23 - becoming a
10:24 - full stack javascript developer and
10:27 - beyond because we will help you
10:29 - with finding your first job as a full
10:31 - stack javascript developer

10:44 - you to becoming a full stack javascript
10:46 - developer with the right mentorship do
10:48 - you think you would fail
10:50 - the answer is probably not unless you
10:52 - don't put in the work so if you're
10:53 - serious about becoming a full stack

Cleaned transcript:

what is up guys daniel here from cleverprogrammer and today i'm going to give you my advice and my tips on what you can start to do especially if you are a new developer so before we get into it guys make sure you hit that like button so that we can put this out there into the world and so that more aspiring developers can see these tips and use these tips for their own good also make sure to subscribe and hit that bell notification icon so every time we drop these fire videos you get notified right away now if you are serious about making money as a developer we do have a link below where you can go ahead and click it's a free training where nods will teach how he was able to make 300 000 in three years as a software developer and how you can too now let's jump into it number one don't do it for the money now here is something that's super controversial because very often you hear people saying like hey you should become an engineer or a software developer because they get paid really well but let me tell you something people that come into this industry because they're trying to do it for the money they're trying to do it for the recognition the prestige end up burning out and don't successfully become software engineers because in reality it's not something that's super easy and simple it's hard it's complicated it's challenging so for you to push through those things you have to make sure you actually enjoy it and you're very passionate about it so if you are doing it for the money let me tell you you're watching the wrong video go ahead go somewhere else go follow your passion go follow your dreams figure out what you actually like what you actually want to go do and go ahead and exit this video but for those who are still here because you realize you're doing programming because it's something you're passionate about you find fulfillment from being a developer let's go ahead and get into number two before i tell you what it is let me tell you this mindset helped to make programming and developing software seem super simple and super easy and this quote took me a long way in my software career this quote is very simple it's not hard it's new now this is so powerful because when i started to get into programming everything seemed really difficult even though i was a logical thinker i was a good problem solver just writing my first piece of code assigning my first variable or even calling my first function didn't make sense but because instead of approaching it in a manner where man this is too hard for me i'm not going to be able to get it i approached it in the manner of this is new it's a skill that i have to build and once i build it it's going to become simpler it's going to become easier i was able to progress rapidly through those plateaus i was able to keep on pushing my career forward i was able to keep on learning more and more and more so by adopting this mindset i switched the frame instead of viewing programming like this impossible challenge that was just hard that i couldn't overcome i viewed programming as a skill that i just had to develop and i just had to spend more time with i had to get more intimate with it and as i got more intimate with it it just became simpler it just became easier to where it almost became like second nature to me now a lot of people look over this but the reality is that becoming a great programmer and becoming great at literally anything else is 80 mental and 20 actual skill so if you show up with the right mentality you're gonna be able to dominate the skill set so number three never stop learning you know one of my favorite mentors warren buffett says the more you learn the more you earn and this directly applies to software development as well you want to make sure that you're always pushing yourself pushing what you know trying to learn more if you already know specific stack or framework or language maybe learn another one that has similar applications or different applications but this will allow you to keep challenge yourself keep growing as a person keep growing as a developer and most importantly adopting this mindset will make sure that your career will be sustainable over a long period of time there's been lots of developers that ended up focusing on just one specific language like maybe fortran and where are they now unfortunately not many people are using it what they had to do was adapt over time and that's what everyone has to do as a software developer as you adapt you take on new skill sets and it's crazy because these skill sets start to compound over time and you just get better and better and better so guys as a new developer one of the biggest challenges that you're going to come across is learning how to manage data now this is gonna be important for becoming a developer because everything in the software world is driven through data that's all the software really is is you're showing data in different ways one of the best ways to learn more about data is by practicing immersing yourself in it and even finding the right mentors to teach you about it and that's why i want to talk today about datacamp datacamp is an online platform that has over 300 classes that will teach you everything you need to learn about data whether it's sql python and much more languages and tools that you're going to need now in data camp you're going to have the right tools to become an absolute expert because they're going to guide you through their courses and their teachings and here's the great thing it's also mobile friendly so it doesn't matter if you're trying to learn while you're walking your dog using the restroom whatever it is you could do it from the web or from your phone and it gets even better because very often we might be running around because of life this is something that you could do on your own schedule so it doesn't matter if you work in the mornings in the evenings if you don't work at all if you're in school whatever your situation may be you can find the time to learn through these courses learn all the things you need to learn about data so you could become an absolute professional so go ahead and check out this class in python where you could learn more about how to use it to create databases or even then this class in sql so you can learn more how to query databases and get the data that you want when you go through these classes you're going to develop so much experience in the back end because it's all about practicality so if you want to become professional and super good with data and the back end go ahead click the link below and check out data camp where it's only going to cost you 25 a month and the amazing thing is these are skills you can develop that will pay back in dividends because if you're able to become a professional you're able to land a job you're going to learn data so well that you'll be able to make so much money that 25 a month will be piece of cake and if you don't get to that point that's only a couple starbucks coffees you don't have to drink so that you could pay for your knowledge and invest into yourself now if you're still on the fence here's the best part you can go over there by clicking the link below and check out every single course's first chapter for free so one thing i see a lot from people pp yes pp practice with patience here's a crazy limiting belief for a lot of new developers they come in thinking that they're going to become these experts in just a matter of 30 days in a specific language or specific framework now for you to become a true master of your craft it's gonna take time it's gonna take practice it's gonna take repetition and it's also gonna take patience because this is a long journey of development in fact i clearly remember talking with a lot of senior software engineers back when i was working at blue origin and they themselves never felt like they had it all figured out because they were always pushing their own boundaries and learning just a little bit more and i saw that i was like man if they are 30 years ahead of me i have to be really patient to put in that time and put in that practice to even get to their skill set but i saw that even they're being patient because they're learning new technologies and they're increasing their skill sets so when i put that into perspective i kept practicing my craft i kept building my applications i kept coding as often as possible but i kept patience in mind i wasn't thinking about the next 30 days the next 60 days or the next 90 days i was thinking about the next three years the next five years and beyond when i started thinking long term this became a simpler game for me i wasn't rushing myself i wasn't feeling anxious anymore about getting it done i just fell in love with the process i fell in love with learning more about programming i fell in love with challenging myself and pushing past my comfort zone so don't forget to pp number five get a mentor now guys one of the most valuable precious resources that both i and you and everyone else have is one specific thing time if i could get all my time back that would be the most amazing thing ever this is the most precious resource on this planet because it's something that we're never going to be able to get back until someone creates a time machine but until then we're never going to be able to get our time back so we want to make sure we're using our time properly and that's the exact reason why i'm creating this video for you especially new developer because i want you to take what i'm saying here and this is three years of me being in the field three years of me learning and these are the things that i wish i knew three years ago and even further back so that i could be even further ahead than where i'm at right now so with all that i'm saying is if you get a mentor you're gonna save yourself time because when you have your mentor you're gonna learn what sucks and what's good you're gonna learn what's a waste of time and what's not waste of time you're gonna learn the things that you have to do to hit your specific goals and the mentor speeds up that process we've all heard that it takes ten thousand hours to become an expert and your mentor has probably put in those ten thousand hours plus more maybe enough to fifteen a hundred thousand hours of work on the craft imagine if you had access to that imagine if all you had to do was ask questions and they could give you the answers and they could guide you down the right path step by step and that's exactly what we offer with the clever programmer full stack mastery bootcamp we take you from a complete beginner knowing nothing about code to
