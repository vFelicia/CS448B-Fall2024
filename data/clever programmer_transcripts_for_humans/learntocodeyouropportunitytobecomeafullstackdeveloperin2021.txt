10:23 - the opportunity around
10:27 - coding and what you can do with it is
10:29 - just astronomical
10:31 - right support your family have more time
10:33 - to spend with your loved ones all that
10:35 - now let's figure out your income goals
10:37 - okay
10:37 - how much income do you want to make per
10:39 - month
10:40 - let me know that and please be realistic
10:42 - guys don't tell me like two million per
10:44 - month just let's start out with being
10:46 - realistic here okay 10k 9k 50k 50k per
10:49 - month holy [ __ ]
10:52 - 150k per month come on guys

10:59 - 10k 8k 9k 9k
11:03 - 10k beautiful nice but not bad not bad
11:05 - so that's a that's a good average okay
11:08 - now let me ask you this do you want a
11:10 - freelance you want a full time right so
11:13 - if you want the freelancer for them put
11:14 - in the chat as well which one you would
11:16 - you rather have freelance or full-time
11:18 - just really curious here freelance or
11:21 - maybe you want to do both both is fine
11:23 - too
11:23 - freelance freelance full-time both both
11:25 - both both both both nice nice nice nice
11:28 - nice beautiful beautiful
11:30 - okay awesome sweet okay let's go ahead
11:33 - and get started on this one
11:34 - so there's freelance course there's full
11:36 - time right here
11:37 - all right so of course guys in terms of
11:39 - freelance and full time both are amazing
11:42 - i personally i've done both and both are
11:44 - completely fine um
11:46 - you have to be careful about where you
11:48 - start out with because something it's
11:49 - not easy like for example freelancing is
11:51 - not the easiest thing i will always tell
11:53 - you that you know if you think that
11:55 - freelance is a piece of cake where you
11:56 - sit on your ass for
11:58 - the whole day and you make ten thousand
12:00 - dollars a month it is not and i will be
12:02 - always realistic with you and i will
12:03 - never uh be the kind of a liar person
12:06 - okay it is hard as [ __ ] and i will tell
12:09 - you this right now and
12:11 - even as a scene developer i was probably
12:14 - making less than when i was working a
12:16 - full-time job so there you go
12:18 - as a freelancer now granted this is only
12:20 - one year into freelancing
12:23 - once you pass the one year you can
12:24 - definitely start making more but just
12:26 - letting you know that it is not easy
12:29 - so if you want to lay in your la uh in
12:31 - your trousers on the beach and encoding
12:34 - and making a million dollars a month uh
12:36 - that's not going to happen sorry
12:38 - hopefully none of you guys are here for
12:39 - this reason okay
12:41 - because you know i'll be realistic with
12:42 - you so guys the really cool thing about
12:45 - you know uh coding is the developer
12:47 - growth is so much if you look at it
12:49 - right in terms of web developers look at
12:51 - this web developer growth is growing
12:54 - every single day anybody know why that's
12:57 - the case why is developer growth growing
12:58 - so much anybody know
13:00 - why is it the case please put in the
13:02 - chat what do you guys think
13:04 - right there's a few reasons why that's
13:06 - the case
13:07 - because everything is digital that's a
13:09 - really really good point everything is
13:10 - digital right also because everything is
13:13 - moving to the web
13:16 - everything is moving to the web you see
13:18 - what i mean
13:19 - so the web you know using javascript
13:22 - right even for example applications like
13:24 - your applications that you download from
13:26 - from ios for ios are now becoming more
13:30 - web related are now becoming more
13:32 - javascript related applications okay
13:35 - again computer jobs are increasing
13:37 - dramatically and then here's all the
13:39 - other jobs increase so you can see what
13:41 - development drops is always going to be
13:43 - higher
13:45 - this is the coolest graph right here
13:47 - why do you think this graph is so
13:49 - important
13:50 - what does it tell you
13:52 - right what we've seen here where we've
13:54 - seen a few things right right it's also
13:56 - becoming remote as well that's right
13:58 - retro that's right everything's becoming
14:00 - more remote why is the graph so
14:01 - important because what do we have here
14:04 - look at this guys
14:05 - 1.4 million computing jobs right 2020.
14:09 - you see this guys
14:11 - that's right
14:12 - job to student ratio that's right right
14:14 - but how many students we have is only
14:16 - four hundred thousand
14:18 - so if the if the demand is so high
14:22 - then how do you compensate for that if
14:25 - the demand is so high then what usually
14:26 - happens if the demand is so high and the
14:28 - supply is so low what usually happens in
14:31 - that situation
14:32 - what do you guys think
14:34 - that's right dan
14:36 - that pay increases by a lot right right
14:39 - like i said it is a top paying degree it
14:42 - is a top paying on the top paying a
14:45 - salaries you'll get so that's what the
14:47 - opportunity is they're so high
14:49 - but i want to be also frank with you
14:51 - because
14:52 - i do not want you to get into this just
14:54 - for the money
14:56 - i know too many people who are in this
14:59 - just for the money and let me tell you
15:01 - most of them have failed
15:04 - period
15:06 - if you're in it just because you just
15:08 - want the money it's not gonna happen why
15:12 - because it's going to get get hard
15:15 - why because it's going to be difficult
15:17 - at some point it's going to be
15:19 - um or you will struggle you will feel
15:22 - down you will feel like you don't want
15:23 - to do this
15:27 - and the way to compensate for that
15:30 - is if you deep down inside you know your
15:32 - proper why
15:34 - you know that you're not just doing it
15:35 - just for the money
15:37 - money is going to be great and it's
15:38 - going to be an amazing result that
15:40 - you'll get yes
15:42 - you could be making great money with
15:44 - this i have developers i know developers
15:46 - who are making 200 000
15:48 - and so forth
15:52 - right 200 and so forth
15:55 - now with that being said though with
15:57 - that being said the one thing i want to
15:58 - tell you
15:59 - the one thing i want to tell you is
16:01 - that petunia is there
16:03 - if you are here because you understand
16:05 - hey i actually come i'm actually
16:07 - interested in something like this i
16:09 - actually love the problem solving
16:11 - if that's your reason then you're in a
16:13 - good place
16:15 - that's right joe passion is first thank
16:18 - you rafa
16:19 - retro says i want to create build and
16:21 - rebuild digital yeah nice job right
16:23 - next new one
16:25 - okay salaries in the u.s january 2021
16:28 - like i said look at this guys ios right
16:30 - here we got you know android we have
16:33 - javascript look at this
16:35 - it's a javascript my friends right here
16:36 - javascript always increasing always so
16:39 - up right a hundred twelve thousand
16:41 - dollars and this is just an average guys
16:42 - by the way it's just average
16:44 - okay python a hundred and ten thousand
16:46 - dollars
16:47 - now
16:48 - which one do you think is the easiest
16:50 - one to learn to get into which one do
16:52 - you guys think
16:57 - somebody said none of them
16:58 - it's actually these two right here
17:03 - it's actually these two right here
17:05 - see python and javascript so python
17:07 - javascript are the easiest one to learn
17:09 - okay
17:10 - i personally started with javascript
17:12 - that was that was my start
17:14 - opposite with javascript that was my
17:15 - start okay
17:17 - now
17:19 - the thing is
17:21 - with python that's also amazing and some
17:23 - of you might like python
17:25 - now the only thing that python can be
17:27 - hard sometimes is actually because
17:30 - anybody here is very visual they like to
17:33 - see visual things they like to see
17:35 - visual aspects right they like to see
17:37 - the results you know in visual uh you
17:41 - know beautiful things anybody here raise
17:43 - your hand i'm just really curious
17:45 - how frankie yes of course
17:46 - [Music]
17:49 - that's right right
17:52 - that's right because the cool thing
17:54 - about javascript is it's very visual
17:56 - that's the really big benefit that we
17:57 - get with js right is that as you're
18:00 - building things you can see them right
18:01 - away on the spot you don't usually get
18:04 - there with python unfortunately that's
18:05 - not the case a lot of python is just
18:07 - quoting like data it's working without
18:09 - it with data that's what python is so
18:11 - that's why we focus so much on
18:13 - javascript because we feel like
18:14 - javascript is a lot easier to get into
18:16 - and we feel like a lot of people are a
18:17 - lot more visual you see what i mean and
18:19 - of course
18:20 - once you learn one language
18:22 - like let's just say like this
18:24 - you can then learn what
18:26 - if you learn one language
18:28 - can you now learn another language
18:31 - yes or no
18:32 - can you now learn another language
18:35 - of course you can yes that's right
18:37 - sharon that's right
18:38 - if you learn this language you can learn
18:40 - this one you can learn this one you can
18:42 - learn this one you can learn pytha if
18:44 - you want to guys okay
18:46 - beautiful let's continue on so like i
18:47 - said from all work guys doing cool 19
18:49 - guys you know that remote has been a
18:51 - really big thing in the past few months
18:54 - i mean look at this we've got remote
18:56 - work right here look at this it's just
18:58 - increasing like crazy guys right anybody
19:00 - here would like to
19:02 - rocker molly just curious anybody here
19:05 - yeah beautiful yeah that's right i do
19:07 - too i like
19:08 - rookie room only
19:11 - i don't always get the chance to but i
19:12 - have the option
19:16 - this my friends is why javascript
19:20 - so let's talk about why javascript well
19:23 - for a few things well it's actually one
19:25 - the one of the ones are very popular
19:27 - right now right so right it's the most
19:29 - used programming language among
19:31 - developers worldwide if you look at this
19:33 - guys look at this
19:34 - html css
19:36 - sql python so yeah this is why this is
19:38 - such a popular language and it's always
19:40 - increasing because the worldwide web is
19:43 - huge
19:45 - right when you go to a website like
19:47 - facebook what do you think it uses uses
19:49 - underneath the hood
19:52 - what
19:52 - what do you think he used underneath the
19:54 - hood that's right
19:55 - javascript artillery that's right
19:58 - javascript
19:59 - okay
20:01 - next up like i said this is again these
20:03 - are the most popular languages based on
20:05 - stack of survey also very very important
20:08 - um
20:09 - next up
20:11 - okay another framework so another thing
20:13 - we always focus on is also like
20:15 - frameworks is what is the most important
20:16 - framework to learn as well so we focus
20:19 - on react gs right here that's our main
20:21 - focus which is this one and of course
20:23 - this one's really really popular because
20:25 - of course uh react.js was built by
20:27 - facebook and a lot of people started
20:29 - using it and so it's become one of the
20:31 - most popular ones now
20:33 - those who don't know this
20:35 - react gs
20:36 - is kind of like the following it's kind
20:38 - of like
20:39 - it's what makes so think about this if
20:43 - the cake is the javascript that's the
20:45 - cake
20:46 - okay it's a javascript directjs is all
20:49 - the filling that makes the cake
20:50 - beautiful
20:52 - okay and makes the cake really really
20:53 - taste well
20:55 - okay that's the react gs to javascript
20:58 - okay
20:59 - okay it's using the cake
21:01 - as the base
21:02 - that's the simplest way you can put it
21:04 - it's using the cake as the base and it's
21:06 - using the other things as a way to kind
21:08 - of make things easier and a lot easier
21:11 - for you to code
21:13 - beautiful next up what can you do with
21:15 - javascript is my question well a few
21:17 - things well think about it top tech
21:20 - companies with javascript i mean i mean
21:21 - i mean look at this tinder uber tesla
21:23 - netflix google airbnb linkedin you name
21:26 - it guys they are using javascript okay
21:29 - ebay you know groupon i mean i just
21:31 - continue on paypal and so forth
21:34 - now
21:35 - here are some applications you can build
21:37 - for example you can build web apps
21:39 - anybody know what website web apps are
21:43 - okay
21:45 - sam says don't ever design kick knots
21:50 - what is the web app anybody know what
21:51 - what is
21:54 - that's right it's a web-based
21:55 - application so a web app guys is
21:57 - basically like
21:59 - facebook that is what a web app is is
22:02 - it's like facebook it's a full
22:04 - application where you can interact with
22:06 - it it is not wordpress and search uh
22:08 - jennifer it's not wordpress um it's more
22:11 - so like it's a full-on application that
22:13 - you can interact with
22:14 - you see what i mean you can interact
22:16 - with it in a few ways one way you can
22:19 - interact with it is by simply you know
22:22 - um
22:23 - uh you know you can log in password you
22:25 - can log in and then you can do a lot of
22:27 - different functionalities like view the
22:29 - news feed arrive you pictures right you
22:32 - name it you can do it right that's a
22:35 - whole web application
22:37 - we also have server apps anybody know
22:39 - what server app is
22:42 - anybody
22:43 - it's a server app
22:45 - that's right joe diaz web apps are
22:47 - single patch applications a lot of times
22:49 - they are very much single page
22:51 - applications
22:52 - a web app guys is actually something
22:54 - called a back-end application for
22:56 - example node.js which is a technology
22:59 - for your server apps node.js is called
23:02 - right and what this literally does is
23:04 - like for example netflix on the backend
23:07 - you know
23:08 - how do you guys think they store
23:10 - all the data like
23:12 - how do you think that when you log in
23:14 - you see all these different videos all
23:16 - these movies you can click on one and
23:18 - you can watch it
23:19 - how do you think that works
23:22 - it's all because of these apps the
23:24 - server apps that's right that's right so
23:27 - when you for example log in and you put
23:29 - in your news name and you put in your
23:30 - password that username and password are
23:32 - going to be checked against a server
23:35 - application that's running somewhere on
23:37 - the server somewhere in the cloud okay
23:39 - it's floating up in the air
23:41 - okay and it's it's giving us some water
23:44 - okay
23:45 - i'm just joking but
23:48 - and this server app my friends is what's
23:50 - going to check hey is for example is
23:53 - philip is philip a real person or not
23:57 - if he's not if his pastor is wrong it's
23:59 - like ah no you're philip your pastor is
24:02 - wrong try again
24:04 - or if lamont for example decides to for
24:06 - example you know uh
24:08 - do it and he's like oh i don't know and
24:10 - he's trying to put in password he gets
24:12 - the password wrong nope that's not right
24:15 - you see what i mean so that's what's
24:17 - going to happen here
24:18 - now of course we have ios and android
24:20 - apps right here guys again these are
24:23 - apps like for example tesla app which is
24:25 - actually using built using javascript
24:27 - crazy enough that's right
24:30 - okay the myth of becoming a developer
24:33 - let me know what are some myths
24:37 - what are some myths about becoming a
24:39 - developer anybody know
24:40 - what do you guys think
24:43 - what are some myths about becoming
24:47 - you will type like a rocket that's right
24:49 - guys i'll be honest with you i'll be
24:51 - fully frank with you
24:53 - i am probably the slowest typer you will
24:55 - ever meet in the world
24:57 - and yes i'm a student developer but i'm
25:00 - the slowest type in the world trust me
25:02 - but it's because coding is not about
25:04 - typing a lot it's about typing little
25:06 - with a lot of intention
25:08 - that's what it's about
25:10 - okay so i can type a lot a lot less but
25:13 - i can type with a lot of intention and
25:14 - do a lot of bigger things okay
25:17 - that's why so one first question do i
25:20 - need degree to get a job as a developer
25:22 - that's my first question
25:25 - good job no joe that's right you cannot
25:27 - you should not well you don't don't have
25:29 - to you can if you want to
25:31 - that's not necessarily the right thing
25:33 - though a lot of my friends do don't even
25:35 - have degrees if you go to google guys
25:39 - google themselves they say
25:41 - do i need computer science degree to be
25:43 - a google software engineer
25:45 - no
25:46 - a cs degree is not required for most of
25:48 - our software engineering or product
25:50 - manager roles
25:52 - i mean it's right there okay can i get
25:54 - any more blunt
25:58 - i don't think so
26:01 - right
26:03 - okay
26:04 - so here
26:05 - i'm self-taught no degree whatsoever i
26:07 - didn't have a problem letting a job at
26:08 - microsoft regardless with a few years of
26:10 - mostly c plus plus experience under my
26:12 - belt wouldn't say even it was hard and
26:14 - no work had asked me if i have a degree
26:17 - or not guys most of my friends who are
26:19 - developers right now work in many
26:20 - different companies do not have degrees
26:22 - just let you know it's not necessary
26:24 - that's why we say
26:25 - screw certifications okay
26:28 - we don't need certifications if you are
26:30 - expecting certification from this
26:31 - five-day challenge this is not a
26:33 - challenge for you
26:35 - but if you're expecting amazing amazing
26:37 - value you're expecting to learn a lot of
26:39 - things then yes this challenge is for
26:40 - you
26:42 - i don't care what certificate you have
26:46 - i'm going to test you on just how good
26:47 - you are and what you can do
26:50 - that's i believe a lot i very much
26:52 - believe certifications are
26:54 - [ __ ]
26:56 - sorry to say that but it's [ __ ]
26:59 - for the most part
27:01 - okay for the most part it is
27:04 - next type so for example tesla right
27:07 - ilamas himself he's like
27:10 - somebody said somebody said to him
27:14 - you can't succeed
27:16 - without
27:17 - in life without degree that's why you
27:19 - need schooling if you want to go to
27:20 - harvard that's not true don't confuse
27:22 - schooling with education
27:24 - i didn't go to harvard but the people
27:25 - that worked for me did
27:26 - you see
27:28 - he says do you still tell me i asked him
27:31 - a question do you still stand firmly or
27:32 - not requiring college degrees i'm not on
27:35 - on not recruiting he's like yes
27:37 - right so even a tesla for example elon
27:40 - musk anybody here loves elon musk and
27:42 - what he does anybody here loves tesla
27:44 - yeah
27:45 - i love tesla guys such a good car
27:49 - it's fast as hell i'll tell you that
27:51 - [Laughter]
27:53 - yeah i gotta say you gotta really buckle
27:55 - up your seats so that's right guys you
27:57 - don't necessarily need this okay let's
27:59 - take a look at the salaries now outlook
28:01 - okay salaries have all been going up in
28:03 - the in the past few years right and
28:05 - continue continuing to go up because why
28:08 - demand continues to go go up okay
28:12 - somebody said i love the company sam
28:14 - says i love my model y uh you have a
28:16 - model y which one do you have a l i have
28:17 - a model y two actually that's right i
28:19 - have a blue model y yeah so
28:23 - that's really really cool
28:24 - but yeah that's the thing guys is like
28:26 - the salaries of developers are
28:28 - continuously increasing continuously
28:29 - increasing non non-nonstop okay
28:33 - oh something said white oh i got the
28:34 - blue one
28:36 - blue is cooler i'm just kidding
28:39 - next up
28:40 - what's here's the breakdown again this
28:41 - is what the entry-level soft engineer
28:43 - does so sound genius as spacex tesla for
28:45 - example cruz okay again average this is
28:48 - these are all average uh engineering
28:50 - jobs for example spacex 109 000 tesla
28:53 - 128 000 cruises 152 000 right and these
28:57 - are all stock options are of course
28:59 - right here you can get as well and again
29:01 - these are all average numbers
29:04 - these are all average numbers guys just
29:07 - wanna let you know about this okay
29:09 - you might not be starting out with this
29:10 - number i want to be upfront with you
29:14 - you might start out with potentially 70
29:17 - 000k
29:18 - 70 000
29:19 - that might be your start
29:21 - if you maybe have some experience in
29:23 - other fields you might start out with
29:25 - ninety thousand
29:27 - that might be another one
29:29 - but
29:30 - i will be very frank with you that you
29:32 - will start out with something like this
29:34 - right away
29:36 - okay
29:37 - let me say i'll accept 60k and scale up
29:39 - nice job that's i like your sound that's
29:41 - good i like sound that's awesome
29:43 - i like it so again
29:46 - the cool thing about development though
29:47 - is that again we're not here with the
29:49 - money
29:50 - when i first started coding
29:52 - i was working for free for two years i
29:55 - worked at a startup company completely
29:57 - free that is how i actually started my
30:00 - career
30:02 - as i joined the startup company i had a
30:05 - few people at the startup company who
30:07 - became my mentors
30:09 - i learned from them
30:11 - that's right and that's how my career
30:14 - got started personally it was not
30:16 - through college it was not through
30:18 - anything else i had amazing mentors who
30:20 - mentored me and i had an amazing team
30:22 - who pushed me
30:24 - and i worked i literally came up to them
30:26 - and said i will work for you for free
30:29 - if i just learn the skills and that's
30:31 - what i did
30:32 - and so for some of you
30:33 - if you really really want to make this
30:36 - happen
30:37 - my one of my biggest recommendations to
30:39 - anybody is you know what
30:41 - find someone
30:43 - find a startup company
30:45 - and exchange your a lot of your work
30:49 - exchange a lot of your work
30:51 - for just
30:53 - free for no money
30:54 - in exchange for skills
30:56 - because skills the roi and skills is
31:00 - astronomical
31:02 - you can either get a certain amount of
31:03 - money and you can be paid 20 an hour
31:06 - or
31:07 - you can be paid
31:10 - 600 an hour later on in your life with a
31:12 - skill that you just learned
31:17 - you see what i mean
31:18 - with the skill they just learned
31:21 - the two years that i worked for them for
31:23 - free is the reason why i'm standing in
31:25 - front of you today
31:27 - it is the reason why i'm teaching you
31:28 - today
31:30 - the skills i learned during those two
31:32 - years
31:33 - with them is the reason why i am here
31:36 - and teaching you
31:38 - the reason why i'm building these
31:39 - projects the reason why you know we have
31:41 - a boot camp that exists
31:44 - not the only reason of course but it was
31:46 - it was a big of course push of the
31:49 - reason what how it may be the way i am
31:51 - today so i want you just to keep that
31:53 - perspective guys don't chase the money
31:56 - chase the skills
31:58 - chase the experience
32:00 - chase the knowledge
32:02 - that's the right thing to chase
32:03 - especially in the coding world
32:06 - because if you know
32:09 - how to be a good coder a good developer
32:12 - quality coder good developer
32:16 - your value is not
32:18 - no longer 170 000
32:21 - or 157 000 no
32:23 - your value is now 200k 250k
32:28 - and even more
32:32 - that's your value
32:34 - versus if you just simply do hey i want
32:36 - to build this i want to just make money
32:38 - i want to charge money right away i have
32:40 - friends who have charged money
32:42 - previously i have friends who went to
32:45 - other jobs and what they honestly just
32:47 - did is they just wanted a nice paycheck
32:49 - they were earning 20 an hour i was happy
32:52 - with that they were pretty much happy
32:55 - they work in a big company
32:58 - then they came to me later on they said
33:00 - nas
33:01 - i don't want to do coding anymore
33:06 - why is that
33:08 - well
33:09 - the company that paid them
33:11 - actually because of such a big company
33:13 - and i get i have nothing against big
33:15 - companies but that big company
33:17 - restricted them on what they can learn
33:22 - instead he was just doing a bunch of
33:23 - like grunt work
33:25 - filling in data
33:27 - that kind of stuff not interesting he
33:28 - was not being creative and learned the
33:31 - knowledge and growing as a developer
33:33 - what you want to chase is how do i grow
33:36 - as developer how do i learn how to get
33:39 - the skills how do i get experience
33:42 - that is what you should be chasing
33:47 - and also how do i make friends in this
33:50 - business
33:53 - like it or not in this means as well as
33:55 - well and very important it's not about
33:57 - what you know
33:59 - but i know it's about who you know guys
34:03 - i know it's crazy for you to think about
34:05 - that
34:06 - but let me just be a front with you all
34:08 - of my jobs that i've had
34:10 - even the way i'm currently working with
34:13 - you guys here today even the way i'm
34:15 - here clever programmer is all because of
34:17 - people that i know
34:22 - i didn't come here alone i came here
34:24 - with people
34:27 - i didn't get my jobs alone i got them
34:29 - with people that i know the people that
34:31 - they that i'm trusted with
34:34 - that's right
34:35 - okay
34:37 - zach if you said how long before the
34:39 - video is posted on youtube well it
34:41 - currently is already streaming on
34:42 - youtube so hopefully you should be on
34:44 - there by the way
34:45 - so can we double check is a youtube
34:47 - video yeah it is yeah the video right
34:49 - now is streaming to youtube
34:51 - okay
34:52 - how did you find a starter company near
34:53 - me well i went to computer i went to
34:56 - computer science i went to like uh
34:58 - computer groups
34:59 - i had some groups in college but if you
35:02 - know if you're not in college you can
35:03 - find groups at meetups.com and other
35:05 - different places like craigslist as well
35:06 - so you go to facebook you can find
35:08 - groups on facebook you can find groups
35:10 - on meetups.com
35:11 - there's a ton of groups you guys can
35:13 - find okay
35:15 - it's just up to you to actually do it
35:17 - because i bet you
35:18 - too many of you are too introverted and
35:20 - i know it's
35:21 - i can't say anything about introverted
35:23 - but too many of you are too introverted
35:24 - and you guys want to go ahead and just
35:27 - not meet anybody unfortunately this
35:29 - business you should
35:32 - my recommendation you don't want to do
35:34 - it feel free but my condition is for you
35:37 - to do it
35:38 - okay
35:40 - next up
35:41 - so here's kaza for example dropped out
35:43 - of college this guy's amazing guy of
35:45 - course jethro college became a
35:46 - millionaire at digital 25 you know
35:48 - started to start a clever programmer
35:50 - taught thousands of people how to code
35:52 - and become developers and now you know
35:54 - running you know clever programmer and
35:56 - of course and making sure that we are
35:58 - you know helping
35:59 - many students every single year our goal
36:01 - always is to get 5 000 developer jobs
36:04 - every single year for 5 000 people as
36:07 - simple as that
36:09 - okay it's as simple as that
36:11 - sam asks how can you find project to

38:31 - is another guy named steve which made me
38:33 - i am but these guys do not have degrees
38:35 - at all
38:37 - and they are working at big companies as
38:40 - look at this as engineering team lead
38:42 - as a team league guys
38:47 - that's right it's a team lead again it
38:48 - does not matter just proves the point
38:50 - there
38:51 - okay here's a career ladder and you can
38:53 - you can write this down if you want here
38:55 - is your career ladder as a developer
38:57 - okay
38:58 - well first you might start out with as a
38:59 - junior star developer so when you first
39:02 - join a company you might start out with
39:04 - just being a junior developer okay
39:06 - uh
39:07 - talk said is boot camp free now bootcamp
39:09 - is not free okay uh so junior search
39:12 - engineer you start out with a junior
39:14 - software engineer and as a june
39:16 - developer you just come in you kind of
39:18 - learn from other developers but you also
39:20 - build software you write code you fix
39:22 - small bugs you know i mean when i came
39:25 - in as a dream developer i was doing a
39:26 - [ __ ] on the [ __ ] honestly i was building
39:28 - whole humongous projects i was
39:30 - challenged to actually lead a team of
39:32 - people it was insane
39:35 - but you know depending on what job you
39:37 - go to
39:38 - then example you might go into the
39:40 - senior south engineer so maybe that's
39:41 - about after a year to two years of
39:43 - coding and this is where not only will
39:45 - your pay will increase by a lot but also
39:48 - um
39:50 - you will actually now get more of a
39:51 - leadership role you might uh lead him
39:54 - you might be leading a team of people uh
39:56 - but you might be actually uh part of a
39:59 - big project that you have to like take
40:02 - on not just yourself but with a whole
40:04 - team okay
40:05 - then with that you might go into a lead
40:07 - developer and coordinate work with team
40:09 - teams here
40:10 - they might go into a technical architect
40:12 - which basically just makes sure that
40:13 - everything is all good in the technical
40:15 - side
40:16 - and then you might go into the manager
40:17 - side and then you might go into the cto
40:19 - position so
40:21 - that's your kind of ladder cto is the
40:22 - chief technology officer and so
40:25 - there this is where you make the most
40:27 - money right here though for sure for
40:28 - sure for sure though developers are
40:30 - still really high income right here as

47:19 - scared to apply but you got the but you
47:21 - have to put that [ __ ] to the side
47:25 - otherwise you won't go nowhere
47:28 - and you'll be stuck twiddling around
47:31 - somewhere
47:32 - around coding trying to learn everything
47:34 - as much as possible trying to be perfect
47:36 - in coding you will never be perfect in
47:38 - coding and you will never learn exactly
47:41 - everything
47:44 - and i might sound negative
47:46 - i'm not being negative i'm just telling
47:48 - you how it is
47:51 - okay
47:52 - there's there's no reason for you to
47:54 - know everything i know too many people
47:55 - who think they want need they need to
47:57 - know they know everything they need to
47:59 - be perfect
48:00 - too many people think that
48:02 - that's not the case guys
48:06 - next up
48:08 - so
48:08 - before we
48:10 - do all this guys you need to learn how
48:11 - to code of course it's very important
48:14 - very important okay
48:16 - let me go and continue on again simplify
48:18 - your journey guys very important so
48:20 - let's go and start our goal okay
48:22 - let's talk about your long-term goal
48:24 - what is your long-term goal do you want
48:26 - to be a full-set developer do you want
48:27 - to be a front developer okay what could
48:29 - be your long-term
48:32 - goal i want you to put in the chat
48:34 - please what could be your long-term goal
48:36 - please put in the chat means maybe it's
48:38 - a front developer maybe it's a full
48:39 - stack developer
48:51 - nice technical lead full stack full
48:53 - stack full stack for the double two
48:55 - three years posted do we need to use
48:56 - github

49:00 - jennifer
49:01 - nice
49:03 - nice nice nice okay now so that's your
49:06 - long-term goal let's talk about your
49:08 - short-term goal what could be your
49:09 - short-term goal guys okay
49:12 - what could be your short-term goal
49:15 - right so again we want to think big want
49:18 - to think
49:19 - something that excites us for me what's
49:21 - exciting is to become a developer that's
49:23 - exciting to make you and we want to make
49:24 - sure you understand the exciting goal
49:26 - but then after that let's figure out how
49:28 - to actually take part into that now the
49:30 - one big oh what do what did i just do
49:32 - i'm not sure what i just did
49:34 - okay now the big exciting thing for that
49:36 - is like it's the following right it's
49:38 - like okay great i have all these skills
49:41 - but
49:42 - what are steps i need to take to
49:43 - actually learn them so for example in my
49:45 - case right now
49:47 - what our certain goal is let's first
49:49 - learn the javascript
49:52 - okay
49:54 - let's learn the foundations
49:58 - okay and let's actually network with
50:00 - people
50:06 - you see that let's network with people
50:09 - that could be your short-term goal for
50:11 - the next one to three months okay does
50:13 - that make sense guys
50:15 - all right beautiful
50:17 - next up
50:20 - now once you've done this we want to
50:21 - make sure we write this down
50:23 - we want to create a timeline for
50:24 - ourselves and make a plan so that
50:26 - everybody write down your short term and
50:27 - your long term goals
50:30 - everybody write them down
50:32 - good job laurence i see you raise your
50:33 - hand nice job
50:35 - good job
50:37 - so if you do not i'm going to give you a
50:38 - minute to write them down i think it's
50:40 - very important for you guys to write
50:41 - them down okay
50:47 - go ahead continue on continue on good
50:49 - beautiful nice job
50:51 - next up again you can also uh when if
50:54 - you want to go ahead and blend things
50:55 - out you can use something called notion
50:57 - it's an amazing platform that we
50:58 - personally use
51:01 - don't worry not sponsored anything like
51:02 - that okay
51:04 - now let's talk about the some important
51:05 - things habits to make sure to you you
51:07 - actually get there okay
51:09 - first things first i want to talk about
51:10 - is something called fun
51:12 - guys
51:13 - as we're coding we don't want to make it
51:15 - a struggle we want to make it fun you
51:18 - want to build fun projects you want to
51:19 - build parts that excite you you want to
51:21 - be you want to learn things that excite
51:22 - you if you're just like grueling if you
51:24 - hate it like
51:26 - if you hate what you're doing right now
51:28 - would you keep doing it yes or no
51:33 - if you hate it
51:34 - tell me just tell me no you would not
51:38 - so let's switch that up
51:40 - let's put fun on the pedestal let's put
51:42 - excitement on the pedestal
51:46 - you see what i mean
51:48 - let's put that on the pedestal and the
51:50 - other things will come a lot easier
51:52 - also hard work guys without hard work
51:54 - nothing happens unfortunately you have
51:56 - to put in the hardware case okay it's
51:59 - very important if you're going to be
52:01 - lazy saying watch netflix all day it's
52:04 - not going to happen next up is patience
52:06 - of course be patient please because it
52:08 - takes time you're not going to be the
52:10 - best right away and you're not might not
52:12 - achieve your goals as fast as you want
52:16 - but if you just keep pushing you will i
52:18 - have to remind myself almost every
52:20 - single day to stay patient to continue
52:23 - doing what i love to do and to not
52:25 - think about so much of the short-term
52:27 - gain that i want to have
52:31 - communication very important learning
52:33 - you have to keep learning every single
52:34 - day and taking initiative when i say
52:37 - take initiative what do you think this
52:38 - means let me ask you this question
52:42 - what do you think it means when i say
52:44 - take initiative what does that mean
52:50 - what does that mean to start okay what
52:52 - else does it mean
52:58 - what else does it mean what do you guys
52:59 - think
53:01 - to be proactive that's right so when i
53:03 - say take initiative a lot of times when
53:04 - i am talking to what's up with
53:06 - developers
53:07 - a lot of developers can be something
53:08 - something called a yes people i call
53:10 - them yes man
53:12 - or just yes people in general okay
53:15 - and basically the way it kind of works
53:17 - is like hey can you build this for me
53:19 - yes hey can you do this for me yes
53:22 - hey is it do you think this is okay yes
53:25 - do you think this feature is good yes
53:28 - i say screw that
53:32 - okay
53:33 - i'm going to say yes when i think it's
53:35 - appropriate
53:36 - now what does that mean
53:38 - that means that i'm going to take
53:39 - initiative on the projects that actually
53:41 - make sense
53:42 - if for example a manager comes up to me
53:44 - and says hey nas
53:46 - can we build a feature
53:48 - i want us to build this feature the next
53:50 - two weeks
53:52 - what is the right answer to that tell me
53:57 - what is it
53:58 - what is the right answer if somebody
54:00 - comes up to you and says hey nas can you
54:02 - build this for me you know for the next
54:04 - two weeks what is your answer
54:07 - somebody said
54:08 - no i just said stop working yes
54:12 - i said [ __ ] yes
54:15 - yes let's do this
54:18 - let me check my schedule
54:23 - so actually here's what i say
54:28 - sam
54:29 - you got it my friend
54:32 - that's right
54:33 - let me look into it and i will let you
54:35 - know
54:38 - let's figure out if what you're trying
54:41 - to build is all actually going to help
54:44 - you achieve your goal
54:46 - too many people when they go into this
54:48 - they think hey i need this feature i
54:50 - need to do this i do this and that and
54:52 - that and they think that's going to
54:53 - actually help them achieve their goal if
54:55 - the goal for example of a specific thing
54:57 - they want to do is i want to to increase
55:00 - engagement on the website or something
55:02 - like that and they come up with a stupid
55:04 - stupid like a interesting way that will
55:06 - not let them do it
55:08 - it's not going to help
55:10 - and you're going to waste a lot of time
55:12 - so instead let's put
55:15 - okay goals on a pedestal what i will say
55:18 - to this person is like okay thank you
55:19 - appreciate it but let's take a look at
55:21 - if what you're trying to build is also
55:23 - actually going to achieve your goal
55:24 - let's figure what your actual goal is
55:26 - and if it's not going to achieve your
55:28 - goal let's figure out what will achieve
55:30 - your goal
55:31 - that's the simplest just put it okay
55:34 - another way to say is like this hey nas
55:37 - or hinas do you want to build the future
55:39 - great let me go ahead and figure out if
55:41 - it's actually going to achieve our goals
55:43 - and let me take a look at how long this
55:45 - will take us
55:46 - and i'll get back to you simple as that
55:49 - you are somebody who's taking initiative
55:51 - that's why i like to use that word
55:55 - how to learn to code okay you can either
55:57 - be anybody here who's this person
55:59 - anybody here this person raise your hand
56:01 - anybody here like this
56:03 - that's right that's frankie right there
56:04 - frankie is this person right here
56:09 - that's frankie right anybody hear this
56:12 - person anybody raise your hand
56:13 - darwin rohith maria maria really come on
56:17 - maria
56:17 - [Laughter]
56:20 - so i was like no
56:21 - jayden said i have my moments nah i have
56:23 - an ultra wide
56:26 - chris says no okay
56:29 - well if you are that's okay i've been
56:30 - there multiple times it's okay
56:33 - all right and there's this person
56:35 - anybody here is this person right here
56:40 - anybody here who's this person
56:43 - craig says sometimes not even close
56:45 - definitely not me jennifer jeff says me
56:49 - no le man yes says yes so guys we
56:53 - actually want to be more on this side
56:56 - we want to be those curious kids who say
56:59 - how can we solve this how can we get
57:01 - this you know you know that kid you know
57:03 - like a little you know everybody anybody
57:04 - has has kids everybody has kids
57:08 - and we have kids you know how sometimes
57:09 - kids are i'll have kids i have a sister
57:11 - so that's so that's how i'm getting my
57:14 - perspective
57:15 - okay i have a sister but when she was
57:18 - little she just wouldn't would no matter
57:20 - what she wants she will cry at it she
57:23 - wants it she will get it no matter what
57:26 - if she wouldn't chocolate she will go
57:29 - for it no matter what
57:31 - right so they can be very very whiny
57:34 - sometimes and very i mean in a way like
57:36 - annoying not annoying but like whiny
57:38 - like isn't they want it and they will do
57:41 - anything to get it
57:43 - that kind of needs to be us sometimes
57:46 - in a weird way
57:48 - we need to think about hey
57:50 - what can we do what are the
57:52 - possibilities we need to do to actually
57:54 - get what we want
57:57 - god says as you were talking about my
57:58 - case that's funny right so there you go
58:02 - now here is the road map to actually
58:04 - like a there's there's something called
58:06 - a full stack developer right here so for
58:07 - example
58:08 - if you're a force developer you get to
58:10 - learn something like front end right
58:11 - here uh backend databases devops you
58:14 - don't necessarily need to learn these
58:16 - don't focus on these you know but you
58:18 - would focus on something like this now
58:20 - some of you might want to actually focus
58:22 - first on front end this might be your
58:24 - option you want to focus on right so
58:26 - this might be something easier for you
58:28 - someone some of you might want to focus
58:30 - on back end right here okay and some of
58:32 - you might want to focus on the database
58:34 - right here now each of these
58:36 - individually are very important and each
58:38 - of these individually are also have a
58:40 - lot of results
58:42 - okay
58:44 - now if you just focus on one though
58:47 - number one you might get the results
58:49 - faster you might get your job faster
58:51 - when i first started i first started
58:53 - with this
58:54 - right here i then moved on to this
58:58 - and then of course while learning this i
59:00 - was learning this together
59:01 - but my first start was simply just this
59:03 - right here
59:05 - that was my first start okay
59:08 - nice
59:10 - so again
59:11 - what do we need to learn html javascript
59:14 - you know react.js firebase these are
59:16 - things you need to learn to actually you
59:18 - know get or to learn to become a front
59:20 - developer
59:22 - so like hi nas dislike
59:24 - the help
59:27 - is this david
59:33 - uh he put a uh
59:35 - that's funny david okay so now guys
59:38 - here's the big difference okay guys
59:40 - there's html the css and javascript and
59:42 - in this five day challenge we're going
59:44 - to be learning all of these okay so html
59:47 - is kind of like the bones right so for
59:49 - example if you look at for example i'm
59:52 - going to use the example here craig
59:55 - okay craig right correct your bones
59:58 - right is the structure right underneath
60:01 - the skin your bone is the structure that
60:03 - my friends is the html
60:05 - raise your hand if you understand that
60:06 - with me yes or no you get it
60:09 - good
60:10 - now
60:11 - whatever you get dressed up with for
60:14 - example if you get dressed up and you
60:16 - put on clothes for example i have a nice
60:17 - t-shirt right now i have this t-shirt i
60:20 - have maybe you know the color of my hair
60:22 - you know um you know maybe what jeans i
60:25 - got that my friends is your css it is
60:27 - your presentation and your appearance
60:31 - okay
60:33 - now
60:34 - the javascript is the funky part
60:37 - who here likes to dance
60:41 - anybody
60:42 - hey let's go retro that's what i'm
60:44 - talking about yeah salsa so really joe
60:48 - you like the salsa no way i didn't know
60:49 - that yeah i liked this i liked it and
60:51 - salsa too but yeah javascript is the
60:54 - movement it is what makes everything
60:56 - work
60:57 - that's right so javascript is like how
60:59 - the way this guy's dancing you're doing
61:04 - you you you know
61:06 - that is the javascript it is what makes
61:08 - everything dynamic html is a structure
61:11 - css is the presentation what makes it
61:13 - all work is javascript that's right
61:18 - sam says i like eating salsa me too i
61:20 - like eating salsa too especially with
61:22 - chips chips and salsa great combination
61:27 - that's right
61:28 - okay
61:30 - next up so ken when we are learning uh
61:32 - html what i want you guys to focus on is
61:34 - very much
61:35 - learn the basics make a page make it
61:38 - work okay do not over complicate it too
61:41 - many people that i talk to all the time
61:43 - they say hey nas it took me one month to
61:45 - learn html css i took this one course
61:48 - and i focused the whole whole month on
61:50 - html css i'm like
61:53 - why
61:58 - i can teach you html and css in one week
62:02 - max
62:04 - you don't need to learn all of that
62:08 - that's what i'm trying to get to so
62:09 - don't over complicate keep it simple
62:12 - again this is what html says it looks
62:14 - like anybody have seen this before raise
62:16 - your hand just really curious
62:19 - anybody
62:21 - yeah and originally if you did not have
62:23 - never seen this before now
62:30 - actually have you not seen this before
62:31 - anybody
62:32 - yeah so we have a few people who have
62:34 - not seen this before
62:37 - nice nice nice so what this is this is
62:39 - html page and the way html is structure
62:41 - is very simple every html website has a
62:44 - doctype html which is saying that this
62:46 - this is an html document starts out with
62:48 - html tag
62:50 - then we have a heading tag anybody know
62:52 - what the heading tag is
62:54 - anybody know this tag right here heading
62:56 - tag anybody
62:59 - yeah that's right so yeah j so the
63:01 - heading tag the heading tag is very
63:02 - simple but jay i like your microphone
63:04 - looks really cool um
63:06 - so the heading tag is very simple the
63:08 - heading tag is what uh basically all the
63:11 - little behind the scenes stuff going on
63:13 - so you might include things like
63:14 - javascript in there you might include
63:16 - the css in there you might include the
63:18 - title in there and then we have the body
63:21 - anybody know what the body is raise your
63:23 - hand
63:25 - anybody know the body is nice good so
63:28 - let's cool them on nice job
63:30 - the body guys is your h1 tags it's your
63:32 - p tags the body is
63:35 - your actual foreign website it is your
63:37 - structure your divs it is how your your
63:39 - actual webs is going to look like the
63:42 - head as literally imagine this the head
63:44 - is literally your head
63:46 - okay the head is literally your head
63:49 - it's like there's a lot of stuff that's
63:50 - going on behind the scenes you don't
63:51 - really notice it okay
63:53 - the body is actually your body
63:55 - right the head controls the body
63:59 - just think about that way okay
64:02 - now of course we got css again again
64:04 - very simple do not over complicate this
64:06 - learn how to use different layouts
64:08 - flexbox write this one down flexbox guys
64:11 - very very very popular and very
64:13 - important flexbox okay
64:15 - and of course we have responsive design
64:17 - and then we have media queries here guys
64:19 - okay
64:21 - so that my friends is the different ways
64:24 - nice and of course we have navigation we
64:26 - have uh this is how css looks like again
64:29 - we will get to learn how to use that
64:31 - today or the next few days
64:33 - beautiful javascript now of course with
64:35 - javascript it's a lot more difficult
64:38 - javascript is not as easy as something
64:39 - you might think
64:42 - not as easy as something you might think
64:43 - at all
64:44 - okay
64:46 - all right so instead what i want you
64:47 - guys to do is we're going to what i want
64:50 - to focus on is how to master the
64:52 - fundamentals
64:53 - right
64:54 - how to master the data types
64:57 - functions es6
64:59 - dom manipulation scope data structures
65:02 - algorithms fetch api
65:04 - all those small things you need to learn
65:08 - now html is going to be easy for you
65:11 - this right here
65:12 - is hard
65:15 - that's right this is the hardest part
65:17 - but this is also the most important part
65:20 - you need to learn my friends
65:23 - data structures algorithms this is what
65:25 - you'll be tested on the actual interview
65:27 - your down manipulation your functions
65:29 - this is what you use every single day
65:31 - when you create javascript applications
65:33 - your fetch api same thing your data
65:35 - types same thing
65:37 - what we want to do guys is the following
65:39 - and i like to use this terminology okay
65:42 - let me go and exit this out
65:45 - when we go ahead let me say this i'm
65:47 - going to build a house right now looks
65:49 - like this you see this house right now
65:51 - you see this house
65:53 - now this house of course has a roof yes
65:56 - or no right it's a roof
65:58 - right here has a roof
66:00 - and of course it has some kind of
66:01 - foundation right
66:04 - like it's standing on the ground right
66:06 - of course this is your ground right here
66:09 - and underneath the ground of course i'm
66:11 - not sure exactly what it is but it's
66:12 - like it has a foundation yes or no
66:14 - correct
66:16 - what do you think is this foundation
66:24 - i'm not a retro i'm not a i'm not a
66:26 - house builder
66:31 - the job that's right so your foundation
66:33 - is actually the fundamentals of
66:34 - javascript
66:39 - it is the fundamentals of html
66:44 - it is the fundamentals of css
66:47 - it is the fundamentals of js of
66:49 - javascript guys
66:51 - that is your foundation
66:53 - and if you don't learn these foundations
66:55 - if you don't learn the functions if you
66:57 - don't learn the manipulation the scope
66:59 - the data structures
67:00 - the algorithms
67:02 - the fetch api you know all the different
67:05 - aspects that make
67:07 - coding possible
67:10 - then my friends
67:12 - if you don't learn this
67:14 - let me ask you if you have a shitty
67:17 - foundation
67:18 - what kind of a house can you
67:20 - build
67:25 - a shitty house that's right it's like
67:27 - you're building a roof
67:29 - when there's no house
67:33 - and would you want to live on a roof
67:36 - i mean some of you might want to do that
67:39 - but would you want to live in a roof no
67:42 - you would not
67:44 - right
67:45 - so what our goal is is hey you know what
67:47 - we need to focus on this foundation to
67:49 - focus on building this foundation so
67:51 - well
67:52 - so good
67:54 - that the rest becomes then we can build
67:57 - beautiful uh maybe we can have we can
67:59 - add furniture to this looking at a bar
68:02 - stool table again i'm horrible at
68:04 - drawing but you get my point right who
68:06 - knows right maybe we will you know rooms
68:10 - want to have this foundation down
68:13 - the other stuff is 10 times easier guys
68:18 - next up
68:22 - to again this is how javascript looks
68:25 - like again
68:26 - you will learn javascript as we continue
68:29 - on going with this okay
68:32 - so
68:33 - let's go ahead let's talk about the
68:34 - frameworks guys now javascript itself is
68:36 - very useful but javascript is not useful
68:38 - if you want to build big applications
68:40 - okay if you just learn javascript this
68:42 - is where after javascript will need to
68:44 - actually once you've run the javascript
68:46 - portion we need to now go into something
68:48 - called frameworks
68:50 - so framework is the following okay
68:52 - framework is example there's angular
68:55 - that's built by google
68:57 - then there is things like view
69:00 - view is actually built by somebody who
69:01 - created react.js
69:04 - actually view was built by somebody who
69:06 - created angular my bad and then there is
69:07 - react gs now we focus on react gs
69:10 - because it's one of the most popular
69:12 - ones it's the easiest one to grasp
69:14 - personally i think so and a lot of
69:17 - people start to use it
69:19 - now
69:20 - anybody know
69:22 - why
69:25 - anybody know
69:26 - why
69:28 - anybody know why let me see this here
69:30 - oh
69:32 - anybody know why specifically you need a
69:36 - framework tell me
69:38 - why
69:48 - reusable components on kit set
69:51 - you guys tell what do you guys think we
69:52 - need to use
69:54 - to build the rest on it that's right
69:57 - make your code easier understandable
69:59 - that's
70:00 - right samuel said because not said so
70:04 - far fast yeah well
70:06 - if you want to build applications like
70:07 - facebook right if you want to build a
70:09 - place like facebook you know there's a
70:11 - lot of pages that
70:13 - are used
70:15 - so for example
70:16 - the javascript application of course
70:18 - might use an html page like this might
70:21 - have the header you know the body but
70:23 - the thing is like for example you might
70:25 - have a navigation bar which is
70:27 - reused on every single page
70:30 - and it's the same navigation bar
70:32 - everywhere
70:34 - so with javascript it's really hard to
70:35 - reuse the same little components
70:38 - but
70:40 - with frameworks like react.js which make
70:43 - things a lot easier
70:45 - it is what makes
70:47 - what allows us to build amazing
70:49 - applications like facebook
70:51 - your current facebook app guys that
70:53 - you're using on the web
70:55 - is built with react gs
70:57 - that's right
70:59 - it is built with
71:00 - reactor yes my friends okay
71:03 - so if you think about it the react gs is
71:05 - like the icing for the cake it is what
71:08 - makes it beautiful makes it taste good
71:10 - you know otherwise if it's just like
71:12 - better yeah i don't want that
71:15 - am i right
71:16 - am i right
71:18 - somebody said is to hold up your body
71:19 - that's right
71:21 - nice so again some companies are using
71:24 - these different frameworks we've got for
71:25 - example
71:26 - um let me go ahead and do this
71:31 - we've got for example angularjs we've
71:33 - got react.js of ugs so airbnb instagram
71:36 - ubereats dropbox are all using react.js
71:39 - on top of for example of course facebook
71:41 - facebook now user very chess as well the
71:43 - guardian upwork paypal starting uses
71:45 - angularjs view alibaba grammarly you
71:48 - know gitlab and so forth right so a lot
71:50 - of the companies are using these
71:51 - frameworks to build their applications
71:54 - okay next up
71:59 - okay now so which should you choose well
72:02 - again why we choose react is because it
72:05 - is one of those popular ones now i want
72:06 - to let you know guys that again as
72:09 - you're learning this please right now
72:11 - please don't jump into reactor yes and
72:14 - and think that you need to learn this
72:16 - first please don't do that you will you
72:18 - are shooting yourself in the foot
72:20 - anybody here who's learned a framework
72:23 - before they actually learn the
72:24 - foundations first
72:26 - or learn javascript first
72:28 - darwin said yes
72:30 - retro
72:33 - anybody else
72:35 - i was saying yes and it's hell
72:38 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so
72:42 - what happens it's like you're trying to
72:44 - put the icing when there's no cake
72:48 - we want to learn the foundations first
72:50 - which makes things later on so much
72:52 - easier with react to yes
72:57 - roger said well i tried to learn react
72:59 - before learning jess and how was that
73:00 - retro
73:04 - let me know in the chat i'm just curious
73:10 - let me say retro is like a nightmare
73:12 - that's right it's because we did not
73:14 - know
73:15 - think about it this react gs was built
73:17 - on javascript by the way i don't know if
73:19 - you guys know but
73:20 - it's using javascript underneath the
73:22 - hood so a lot of its
73:24 - functionality it's all using js
73:27 - but you're trying to learn
73:29 - crazy
73:30 - functionality where you don't know what
73:33 - it's built on so we want to learn what
73:35 - it's built on
73:36 - how that works and then the rest can be
73:38 - a lot easier after that
73:41 - so like i said you know react becoming
73:43 - very popular every single year
73:45 - right here so react for the win okay
73:49 - again top tech companies using react
73:50 - tinder ebay uber paypal groupon i mean
73:53 - you name it guys they're all very
73:55 - popular okay now some resources tool for
73:57 - you guys to learn very important
74:00 - okay
74:00 - um
74:01 - of course we have a learn one developed
74:03 - by building building projects we have
74:05 - that's just like a small little course
74:06 - that we have um if you guys want to go
74:09 - ahead we also these are the modules that
74:11 - we have

he's a crazy guy but he's a cool guy and this is your portfolio so we're giving you the projects so not only will you guys build three projects already in these next few days which is basically like a marathon what you're doing right now is you're doing a marathon and you're building three amazing projects and then you're going to put those parts in your portfolio which then you can use for your linkedin for your resume you can use it when you go to into a job interview and you know just showcase what you know all right so this is crazy three days in the next i mean the next five days i'm

what you're doing this is the whole amazing team that's made this all happen please give our applause for the amazing team who's making sure that this is all being done without them this is not possible if i would if this was like this this is very hard to just buy in one with one person trust me to make it all happen it takes an amazing team of people okay i always like to say as a one person i can move a hill together we can move mountains i always say that and i believe that and i stay true to that okay that's why i encourage you always guys to be very you know to in the coding world i encourage you to be an extrovert i encourage you to try and go out there put yourself out there connect with other people find amazing developers right that is what's going to bring you so much value so much connections so much opportunity when you get into this business all right let's continue on so meet your instructor guys this is me this is nas i'm the funny guy in the right hand side i mean i'm not that funny i try to be funny sometimes i totally fail um but i try my best is what i'll tell you okay what i'll tell you is i try my best but this is me i like to throw computers up in the air uh that's what i like to do and of course uh don't worry i did not break it although they broke later they break later on um so that's it but um i've been recording for the past 10 years i've been in the business for the past seven years i've interviewed with so many companies i mean including google including twitter khan academy squarespace volunteer i mean you name it right uh with i eventually with companies like for example even um wasn't another company it was a big one for me uh urban science as well so many so many different companies guys all right let's continue on beautiful let me go and make sure that this is oh whoop there we go awesome i'm gonna continue on like this all right so let's take a look at what you're about to build guys these next these next few enable these next right what are you about to build uh these next few days okay well uh a few things okay this is again these designs are brought to you by a company called frontend mentor it's an amazing company where they build projects who here has ever had a situation where maybe you yourself did not know what project to build anybody raised your hand or you were confused or you did not have an idea well find a mentor has the idea for you so they actually have the amazing designs for you and all you do is just simply build them using you know your javascript skills html css so for example as i saw over here this is what they've got they've got amazing products you can simply just choose go on there it's called fundamentor just check it out it's gonna be amazing okay just trust me on this one okay so 20k one of the things we're going to build is something called the 20k startup landing page that is part one and it looks a little bit like this look at this it's a beautiful amazing uh mobile friendly website it's a landing page that you would sometimes build for a company imagine as if as if a freelancing company came to you and say hey you know what can you please build this for me and you'll be the one to actually build it all right very looking very cool next up we're going to build a javascript game right here it's a it's a kind of rock paper scissors game it looks beautiful as well um and uh i go ahead what's up something okay nevermind so another beautiful amazing game and then i'm going to build a sas product guys look at this a sas product oh what is this a sas product right and this product it's a to do application right to do todo list application again looks beautiful looks amazing and we will actually include something called the database we'll use firebase with this one javascript html css to you know be able to save this data and save your todo list app as you're working you know as you're actually you know creating the todo list application to do the todo items beautiful last but not least we'll put all your shiny new projects into a portfolio that's going to look like this right so there we go that's what you get okay also last thing we will also talk about a new frontend bootcamp that we just launched again this is for those of you who are very serious about becoming developers which i'm just really curious who here is very serious about actually taking a a challenge and becoming a developer and actually challenging themselves i'm curious who is it what is this what is this sound what does this sound why is it like this let me see here one second sorry guys oh the speaker is down there we go okay yeah so those who are very serious just please put in the chat i'm really curious if you if you are serious just say i am serious in the chat okay just plead that please put that in and so we'll be talking about how we can help you out we've launched this amazing new boot camp that takes you from zero to front developer in 90 days um amazing uh you know we're very serious about this we have done this for many students a lot of since a lot of our students already got jobs results making over seventy thousand dollars yeah it just continues on we'll be talking about that later on as well beautiful so the question is very simple are you ready my friend yes or no raise your hand with me if you are we're going to get started right away an opportunity to become a frontend developer beautiful okay so really quick question all right let's get started amazing so today here's your agenda okay today is your opportunity to become a developer in 2021 day two is going to be about building right here building a startup landing page using html css of course build that came using javascript build a sas product using javascript as well and how to become a front developer in 90 days uh we'll be talking about that on last day right what are the steps you need to take to actually be that developer right because you've used you've built all these different projects now you need to actually do something with them does that make sense yes or no beautiful so okay in this one we'll talk about your opportunity will we will be unraveling the myths behind becoming a developer we'll talk about how to get started with code how to build or host your own portfolio online as well okay nice we'll go deep into building your personal enrollment and how to land a job as developer as a full set developer or as a front developer but for now let's figure out why you want to become a developer does that sound good let's figure out why are you here okay so let me ask this question what are the three things more important to you than money i'm really curious what are three things more important to you than money you guys tell me and i please put it in the chat please what are three things more important to you than money family a lot of people say joy love family put in an idea out in the world time career nice beautiful family time employment stability flexibility that makes sense that definitely makes sense that makes sense okay so like i like this i would think right so right now let me ask this question who what can making money as developer help you achieve in your life i'm very curious what can making money as a developer help you help uh help you achieve in your life let me ask you that not being homeless oh wow okay better life for me and the family independence financial but yeah from the financial dependence that sounds like a lot like freedom financial dependence right freedom nice to live luxurious life open doors okay raise your hand if you just simply want if you want freedom raise your hand if you want freedom from your current job you want freedom to be able to maybe go different places to not necessarily be stuck in one desk to work remotely right nice beautiful the opportunity guys in coding is so much the opportunity around coding and what you can do with it is just astronomical right support your family have more time to spend with your loved ones all that now let's figure out your income goals okay how much income do you want to make per month let me know that and please be realistic guys don't tell me like two million per month just let's start out with being realistic here okay 10k 9k 50k 50k per month holy [ __ ] 150k per month come on guys 10k 5k all right okay 10k 8k 9k 9k 10k beautiful nice but not bad not bad so that's a that's a good average okay now let me ask you this do you want a freelance you want a full time right so if you want the freelancer for them put in the chat as well which one you would you rather have freelance or fulltime just really curious here freelance or maybe you want to do both both is fine too freelance freelance fulltime both both both both both both nice nice nice nice nice beautiful beautiful okay awesome sweet okay let's go ahead and get started on this one so there's freelance course there's full time right here all right so of course guys in terms of freelance and full time both are amazing i personally i've done both and both are completely fine um you have to be careful about where you start out with because something it's not easy like for example freelancing is not the easiest thing i will always tell you that you know if you think that freelance is a piece of cake where you sit on your ass for the whole day and you make ten thousand dollars a month it is not and i will be always realistic with you and i will never uh be the kind of a liar person okay it is hard as [ __ ] and i will tell you this right now and even as a scene developer i was probably making less than when i was working a fulltime job so there you go as a freelancer now granted this is only one year into freelancing once you pass the one year you can definitely start making more but just letting you know that it is not easy so if you want to lay in your la uh in your trousers on the beach and encoding and making a million dollars a month uh that's not going to happen sorry hopefully none of you guys are here for this reason okay because you know i'll be realistic with you so guys the really cool thing about you know uh coding is the developer growth is so much if you look at it right in terms of web developers look at this web developer growth is growing every single day anybody know why that's the case why is developer growth growing so much anybody know why is it the case please put in the chat what do you guys think right there's a few reasons why that's the case because everything is digital that's a really really good point everything is digital right also because everything is moving to the web everything is moving to the web you see what i mean so the web you know using javascript right even for example applications like your applications that you download from from ios for ios are now becoming more web related are now becoming more javascript related applications okay again computer jobs are increasing dramatically and then here's all the other jobs increase so you can see what development drops is always going to be higher this is the coolest graph right here why do you think this graph is so important what does it tell you right what we've seen here where we've seen a few things right right it's also becoming remote as well that's right retro that's right everything's becoming more remote why is the graph so important because what do we have here look at this guys 1.4 million computing jobs right 2020. you see this guys that's right job to student ratio that's right right but how many students we have is only four hundred thousand so if the if the demand is so high then how do you compensate for that if the demand is so high then what usually happens if the demand is so high and the supply is so low what usually happens in that situation what do you guys think that's right dan that pay increases by a lot right right like i said it is a top paying degree it is a top paying on the top paying a salaries you'll get so that's what the opportunity is they're so high but i want to be also frank with you because i do not want you to get into this just for the money i know too many people who are in this just for the money and let me tell you most of them have failed period if you're in it just because you just want the money it's not gonna happen why because it's going to get get hard why because it's going to be difficult at some point it's going to be um or you will struggle you will feel down you will feel like you don't want to do this and the way to compensate for that is if you deep down inside you know your proper why you know that you're not just doing it just for the money money is going to be great and it's going to be an amazing result that you'll get yes you could be making great money with this i have developers i know developers who are making 200 000 and so forth right 200 and so forth now with that being said though with that being said the one thing i want to tell you the one thing i want to tell you is that petunia is there if you are here because you understand hey i actually come i'm actually interested in something like this i actually love the problem solving if that's your reason then you're in a good place that's right joe passion is first thank you rafa retro says i want to create build and rebuild digital yeah nice job right next new one okay salaries in the u.s january 2021 like i said look at this guys ios right here we got you know android we have javascript look at this it's a javascript my friends right here javascript always increasing always so up right a hundred twelve thousand dollars and this is just an average guys by the way it's just average okay python a hundred and ten thousand dollars now which one do you think is the easiest one to learn to get into which one do you guys think somebody said none of them it's actually these two right here it's actually these two right here see python and javascript so python javascript are the easiest one to learn okay i personally started with javascript that was that was my start opposite with javascript that was my start okay now the thing is with python that's also amazing and some of you might like python now the only thing that python can be hard sometimes is actually because anybody here is very visual they like to see visual things they like to see visual aspects right they like to see the results you know in visual uh you know beautiful things anybody here raise your hand i'm just really curious how frankie yes of course that's right right that's right because the cool thing about javascript is it's very visual that's the really big benefit that we get with js right is that as you're building things you can see them right away on the spot you don't usually get there with python unfortunately that's not the case a lot of python is just quoting like data it's working without it with data that's what python is so that's why we focus so much on javascript because we feel like javascript is a lot easier to get into and we feel like a lot of people are a lot more visual you see what i mean and of course once you learn one language like let's just say like this you can then learn what if you learn one language can you now learn another language yes or no can you now learn another language of course you can yes that's right sharon that's right if you learn this language you can learn this one you can learn this one you can learn this one you can learn pytha if you want to guys okay beautiful let's continue on so like i said from all work guys doing cool 19 guys you know that remote has been a really big thing in the past few months i mean look at this we've got remote work right here look at this it's just increasing like crazy guys right anybody here would like to rocker molly just curious anybody here yeah beautiful yeah that's right i do too i like rookie room only i don't always get the chance to but i have the option this my friends is why javascript so let's talk about why javascript well for a few things well it's actually one the one of the ones are very popular right now right so right it's the most used programming language among developers worldwide if you look at this guys look at this html css sql python so yeah this is why this is such a popular language and it's always increasing because the worldwide web is huge right when you go to a website like facebook what do you think it uses uses underneath the hood what what do you think he used underneath the hood that's right javascript artillery that's right javascript okay next up like i said this is again these are the most popular languages based on stack of survey also very very important um next up okay another framework so another thing we always focus on is also like frameworks is what is the most important framework to learn as well so we focus on react gs right here that's our main focus which is this one and of course this one's really really popular because of course uh react.js was built by facebook and a lot of people started using it and so it's become one of the most popular ones now those who don't know this react gs is kind of like the following it's kind of like it's what makes so think about this if the cake is the javascript that's the cake okay it's a javascript directjs is all the filling that makes the cake beautiful okay and makes the cake really really taste well okay that's the react gs to javascript okay okay it's using the cake as the base that's the simplest way you can put it it's using the cake as the base and it's using the other things as a way to kind of make things easier and a lot easier for you to code beautiful next up what can you do with javascript is my question well a few things well think about it top tech companies with javascript i mean i mean i mean look at this tinder uber tesla netflix google airbnb linkedin you name it guys they are using javascript okay ebay you know groupon i mean i just continue on paypal and so forth now here are some applications you can build for example you can build web apps anybody know what website web apps are okay sam says don't ever design kick knots what is the web app anybody know what what is that's right it's a webbased application so a web app guys is basically like facebook that is what a web app is is it's like facebook it's a full application where you can interact with it it is not wordpress and search uh jennifer it's not wordpress um it's more so like it's a fullon application that you can interact with you see what i mean you can interact with it in a few ways one way you can interact with it is by simply you know um uh you know you can log in password you can log in and then you can do a lot of different functionalities like view the news feed arrive you pictures right you name it you can do it right that's a whole web application we also have server apps anybody know what server app is anybody it's a server app that's right joe diaz web apps are single patch applications a lot of times they are very much single page applications a web app guys is actually something called a backend application for example node.js which is a technology for your server apps node.js is called right and what this literally does is like for example netflix on the backend you know how do you guys think they store all the data like how do you think that when you log in you see all these different videos all these movies you can click on one and you can watch it how do you think that works it's all because of these apps the server apps that's right that's right so when you for example log in and you put in your news name and you put in your password that username and password are going to be checked against a server application that's running somewhere on the server somewhere in the cloud okay it's floating up in the air okay and it's it's giving us some water okay i'm just joking but and this server app my friends is what's going to check hey is for example is philip is philip a real person or not if he's not if his pastor is wrong it's like ah no you're philip your pastor is wrong try again or if lamont for example decides to for example you know uh do it and he's like oh i don't know and he's trying to put in password he gets the password wrong nope that's not right you see what i mean so that's what's going to happen here now of course we have ios and android apps right here guys again these are apps like for example tesla app which is actually using built using javascript crazy enough that's right okay the myth of becoming a developer let me know what are some myths what are some myths about becoming a developer anybody know what do you guys think what are some myths about becoming you will type like a rocket that's right guys i'll be honest with you i'll be fully frank with you i am probably the slowest typer you will ever meet in the world and yes i'm a student developer but i'm the slowest type in the world trust me but it's because coding is not about typing a lot it's about typing little with a lot of intention that's what it's about okay so i can type a lot a lot less but i can type with a lot of intention and do a lot of bigger things okay that's why so one first question do i need degree to get a job as a developer that's my first question good job no joe that's right you cannot you should not well you don't don't have to you can if you want to that's not necessarily the right thing though a lot of my friends do don't even have degrees if you go to google guys google themselves they say do i need computer science degree to be a google software engineer no a cs degree is not required for most of our software engineering or product manager roles i mean it's right there okay can i get any more blunt i don't think so right okay so here i'm selftaught no degree whatsoever i didn't have a problem letting a job at microsoft regardless with a few years of mostly c plus plus experience under my belt wouldn't say even it was hard and no work had asked me if i have a degree or not guys most of my friends who are developers right now work in many different companies do not have degrees just let you know it's not necessary that's why we say screw certifications okay we don't need certifications if you are expecting certification from this fiveday challenge this is not a challenge for you but if you're expecting amazing amazing value you're expecting to learn a lot of things then yes this challenge is for you i don't care what certificate you have i'm going to test you on just how good you are and what you can do that's i believe a lot i very much believe certifications are [ __ ] sorry to say that but it's [ __ ] for the most part okay for the most part it is next type so for example tesla right ilamas himself he's like somebody said somebody said to him you can't succeed without in life without degree that's why you need schooling if you want to go to harvard that's not true don't confuse schooling with education i didn't go to harvard but the people that worked for me did you see he says do you still tell me i asked him a question do you still stand firmly or not requiring college degrees i'm not on on not recruiting he's like yes right so even a tesla for example elon musk anybody here loves elon musk and what he does anybody here loves tesla yeah i love tesla guys such a good car it's fast as hell i'll tell you that [Laughter] yeah i gotta say you gotta really buckle up your seats so that's right guys you don't necessarily need this okay let's take a look at the salaries now outlook okay salaries have all been going up in the in the past few years right and continue continuing to go up because why demand continues to go go up okay somebody said i love the company sam says i love my model y uh you have a model y which one do you have a l i have a model y two actually that's right i have a blue model y yeah so that's really really cool but yeah that's the thing guys is like the salaries of developers are continuously increasing continuously increasing non nonnonstop okay oh something said white oh i got the blue one blue is cooler i'm just kidding next up what's here's the breakdown again this is what the entrylevel soft engineer does so sound genius as spacex tesla for example cruz okay again average this is these are all average uh engineering jobs for example spacex 109 000 tesla 128 000 cruises 152 000 right and these are all stock options are of course right here you can get as well and again these are all average numbers these are all average numbers guys just wanna let you know about this okay you might not be starting out with this number i want to be upfront with you you might start out with potentially 70 000k 70 000 that might be your start if you maybe have some experience in other fields you might start out with ninety thousand that might be another one but i will be very frank with you that you will start out with something like this right away okay let me say i'll accept 60k and scale up nice job that's i like your sound that's good i like sound that's awesome i like it so again the cool thing about development though is that again we're not here with the money when i first started coding i was working for free for two years i worked at a startup company completely free that is how i actually started my career as i joined the startup company i had a few people at the startup company who became my mentors i learned from them that's right and that's how my career got started personally it was not through college it was not through anything else i had amazing mentors who mentored me and i had an amazing team who pushed me and i worked i literally came up to them and said i will work for you for free if i just learn the skills and that's what i did and so for some of you if you really really want to make this happen my one of my biggest recommendations to anybody is you know what find someone find a startup company and exchange your a lot of your work exchange a lot of your work for just free for no money in exchange for skills because skills the roi and skills is astronomical you can either get a certain amount of money and you can be paid 20 an hour or you can be paid 600 an hour later on in your life with a skill that you just learned you see what i mean with the skill they just learned the two years that i worked for them for free is the reason why i'm standing in front of you today it is the reason why i'm teaching you today the skills i learned during those two years with them is the reason why i am here and teaching you the reason why i'm building these projects the reason why you know we have a boot camp that exists not the only reason of course but it was it was a big of course push of the reason what how it may be the way i am today so i want you just to keep that perspective guys don't chase the money chase the skills chase the experience chase the knowledge that's the right thing to chase especially in the coding world because if you know how to be a good coder a good developer quality coder good developer your value is not no longer 170 000 or 157 000 no your value is now 200k 250k and even more that's your value versus if you just simply do hey i want to build this i want to just make money i want to charge money right away i have friends who have charged money previously i have friends who went to other jobs and what they honestly just did is they just wanted a nice paycheck they were earning 20 an hour i was happy with that they were pretty much happy they work in a big company then they came to me later on they said nas i don't want to do coding anymore why is that well the company that paid them actually because of such a big company and i get i have nothing against big companies but that big company restricted them on what they can learn instead he was just doing a bunch of like grunt work filling in data that kind of stuff not interesting he was not being creative and learned the knowledge and growing as a developer what you want to chase is how do i grow as developer how do i learn how to get the skills how do i get experience that is what you should be chasing and also how do i make friends in this business like it or not in this means as well as well and very important it's not about what you know but i know it's about who you know guys i know it's crazy for you to think about that but let me just be a front with you all of my jobs that i've had even the way i'm currently working with you guys here today even the way i'm here clever programmer is all because of people that i know i didn't come here alone i came here with people i didn't get my jobs alone i got them with people that i know the people that they that i'm trusted with that's right okay zach if you said how long before the video is posted on youtube well it currently is already streaming on youtube so hopefully you should be on there by the way so can we double check is a youtube video yeah it is yeah the video right now is streaming to youtube okay how did you find a starter company near me well i went to computer i went to computer science i went to like uh computer groups i had some groups in college but if you know if you're not in college you can find groups at meetups.com and other different places like craigslist as well so you go to facebook you can find groups on facebook you can find groups on meetups.com there's a ton of groups you guys can find okay it's just up to you to actually do it because i bet you too many of you are too introverted and i know it's i can't say anything about introverted but too many of you are too introverted and you guys want to go ahead and just not meet anybody unfortunately this business you should my recommendation you don't want to do it feel free but my condition is for you to do it okay next up so here's kaza for example dropped out of college this guy's amazing guy of course jethro college became a millionaire at digital 25 you know started to start a clever programmer taught thousands of people how to code and become developers and now you know running you know clever programmer and of course and making sure that we are you know helping many students every single year our goal always is to get 5 000 developer jobs every single year for 5 000 people as simple as that okay it's as simple as that sam asks how can you find project to enhance skills and get paid even if i get paid by portfolio building a 20 for a project i heard people do that uh don't chase 20 bucks sam here's what i and this is what my mom taught me either go big or go home what i mean either you charge no money for a project or you charge thousands of dollars for a project i don't like that middle ground at all either i charge no money which gives me a lot more leverage to learn or i just or once i do know how to build things i charge thousands of dollars i've charged ten thousand dollars for a project of charge twelve dollars for a project i mean it goes on and on so just letting you guys know don't try all just hey you know what if you see a project just hey i'll put it for free for you don't worry about it i wanna i wanna get the skills okay this is jessie uh she's an interesting person this is jessie no but she's an amazing person she works directly with me and she's one of the amazing stars of the boot camp as well and you know um she actually started out as a tax law a consultant and she has two degrees in tax a consultant i have no idea why but it was her decision and then she completely switched to computer science degree completely not degree but she got a job as developer you know uh and completely switched to software development literally you know after texting consultant and so she made a career switch in her life because she did not like what she was doing and now she's actually teaching in the boot camp she's teaching others how to do the same amazing person guys you'll get to meet her of course in the booth game as well if anybody here gets to join robert another amazing friend of mine or right here does not have a degree of course uh again there's some people that do not have degrees by the way the company that i started with him is called trendala right here if you guys want to check it out just google trend dollar you will see the pictures really really cool and all this is is it's like a project that brings together different clothing from different stores and so he was one of my first mentors actually he's the reason why i kind of became you know the way i am today on top of that is another guy named steve which made me i am but these guys do not have degrees at all and they are working at big companies as look at this as engineering team lead as a team league guys that's right it's a team lead again it does not matter just proves the point there okay here's a career ladder and you can you can write this down if you want here is your career ladder as a developer okay well first you might start out with as a junior star developer so when you first join a company you might start out with just being a junior developer okay uh talk said is boot camp free now bootcamp is not free okay uh so junior search engineer you start out with a junior software engineer and as a june developer you just come in you kind of learn from other developers but you also build software you write code you fix small bugs you know i mean when i came in as a dream developer i was doing a [ __ ] on the [ __ ] honestly i was building whole humongous projects i was challenged to actually lead a team of people it was insane but you know depending on what job you go to then example you might go into the senior south engineer so maybe that's about after a year to two years of coding and this is where not only will your pay will increase by a lot but also um you will actually now get more of a leadership role you might uh lead him you might be leading a team of people uh but you might be actually uh part of a big project that you have to like take on not just yourself but with a whole team okay then with that you might go into a lead developer and coordinate work with team teams here they might go into a technical architect which basically just makes sure that everything is all good in the technical side and then you might go into the manager side and then you might go into the cto position so that's your kind of ladder cto is the chief technology officer and so there this is where you make the most money right here though for sure for sure for sure though developers are still really high income right here as well okay next up so what is the first step you should take good question guys what do i need to do to pass the interview another good question and how do i get notice another amazing question okay so first question and of course how many interviews to do so first question i want to ask you is the following um what is the first step you should take let me ask you this what do you guys think is the first step you should take put it please put it in the chat what is the first step you should take that's right that's right you my friends are here to learn you are here to learn get the skills please the skills is the most important knowledge ever heard the phrase knowledge is power who here has heard the phrase knowledge is power that's right because it is okay because it is so the more knowledge you have the more confidence you have the more you can do the more you you know you could the more opportunities you get it's unlimited okay next up what do i need to do to pass the interview another good question what do you guys think you need to do to pass the interview what do you guys think anybody here that's right so yeah a few things you actually i want to talk about here with something like this well a few things that you need to do to pass the interview one of course you need to learn so learn right here okay part two what you need to do is actually you need to learn algorithms and data structures right here and data structures right here you see that right here algorithms and data structures so what those are are those really important it's algorithms which is what you you would mostly be tested on you know on the coding in interviews so it's very important you guys learn those and of course you need to have your mindset straight what i tell everybody when you go into an interview guys and this might sound bad but you go in there like a [ __ ] ceo period you go in there like a ceo you go in there with confidence you go in there showing that you are here not to just [ __ ] not to just you know think that you are here just you know to question yourself no you go in there with knowing what your value is and how you're going to provide that value to the company simple as that if that's your mindset you can get a new job when i came into a job on the jobs i took on was a job where they required react gs and i did not know react to yes at all by the way they still hired me that's right they still hired me okay so really important i just want to make sure that's clear okay next up how do i get notice another good question how do i get noticed anybody know now working lemon that's right so networking communication let me write this down for you that's right now working so networking right here communication i want to say another big one that you need to really focus on is called something i'll call linkedin and of course i'm going to say your resume linkedin and your resume okay guys that's right networking making it's right making connections that's how you can notice if you are the smartest person in the room and do you agree with me this or not if you are the smartest person in the room but you don't know how to show it are you really the smartest person in the room yes or no no no you're not actually because nobody knows that you are the smartest person in the room still nor do they care right so if you are really smart if you're good at something if you've done amazing projects this is where you need to learn it's like basically you are marketing yourself you are selling yourself you need to know how to sell yourself and this might sound bad but you're selling yourself for the good you're selling yourself because you're selling yourself because you have so many amazing skills to showcase you see what i mean so that's how i want you to think about again connections communications that's why it's having these linkedin your resume your your connections your network is the most one of the most important things you can do okay next slide right here boom so how many interviews should you take on anybody know how many interviews should you have what do you guys think can anybody guess i want to say around minimum of 300 guys you want to be when you go to the interview side guys it's very simple it's as many as possible actually here's a you interview until until you get the job it's as simple as that okay you enter until you get the job i have a question somebody asked me a question one time very simple somebody asked me a question i said hey nas how to get a job at google okay how do i get a job at google i asked them a question i said did you apply yet they're like no that's i said well that's your first step right that's your first step so that is we want to focus on is is how do we apply to jobs you should be applying when you're in the interview phase you are applying three to five times a day when i was in this stage applying was my fulltime job guys my fulltime job and you might be too scared to apply but you got the but you have to put that [ __ ] to the side otherwise you won't go nowhere and you'll be stuck twiddling around somewhere around coding trying to learn everything as much as possible trying to be perfect in coding you will never be perfect in coding and you will never learn exactly everything and i might sound negative i'm not being negative i'm just telling you how it is okay there's there's no reason for you to know everything i know too many people who think they want need they need to know they know everything they need to be perfect too many people think that that's not the case guys next up so before we do all this guys you need to learn how to code of course it's very important very important okay let me go and continue on again simplify your journey guys very important so let's go and start our goal okay let's talk about your longterm goal what is your longterm goal do you want to be a fullset developer do you want to be a front developer okay what could be your longterm goal i want you to put in the chat please what could be your longterm goal please put in the chat means maybe it's a front developer maybe it's a full stack developer nice technical lead full stack full stack full stack for the double two three years posted do we need to use github no do not use get ios down somebody said jennifer nice nice nice nice okay now so that's your longterm goal let's talk about your shortterm goal what could be your shortterm goal guys okay what could be your shortterm goal right so again we want to think big want to think something that excites us for me what's exciting is to become a developer that's exciting to make you and we want to make sure you understand the exciting goal but then after that let's figure out how to actually take part into that now the one big oh what do what did i just do i'm not sure what i just did okay now the big exciting thing for that is like it's the following right it's like okay great i have all these skills but what are steps i need to take to actually learn them so for example in my case right now what our certain goal is let's first learn the javascript okay let's learn the foundations okay and let's actually network with people you see that let's network with people that could be your shortterm goal for the next one to three months okay does that make sense guys all right beautiful next up now once you've done this we want to make sure we write this down we want to create a timeline for ourselves and make a plan so that everybody write down your short term and your long term goals everybody write them down good job laurence i see you raise your hand nice job good job so if you do not i'm going to give you a minute to write them down i think it's very important for you guys to write them down okay go ahead continue on continue on good beautiful nice job next up again you can also uh when if you want to go ahead and blend things out you can use something called notion it's an amazing platform that we personally use don't worry not sponsored anything like that okay now let's talk about the some important things habits to make sure to you you actually get there okay first things first i want to talk about is something called fun guys as we're coding we don't want to make it a struggle we want to make it fun you want to build fun projects you want to build parts that excite you you want to be you want to learn things that excite you if you're just like grueling if you hate it like if you hate what you're doing right now would you keep doing it yes or no if you hate it tell me just tell me no you would not so let's switch that up let's put fun on the pedestal let's put excitement on the pedestal you see what i mean let's put that on the pedestal and the other things will come a lot easier also hard work guys without hard work nothing happens unfortunately you have to put in the hardware case okay it's very important if you're going to be lazy saying watch netflix all day it's not going to happen next up is patience of course be patient please because it takes time you're not going to be the best right away and you're not might not achieve your goals as fast as you want but if you just keep pushing you will i have to remind myself almost every single day to stay patient to continue doing what i love to do and to not think about so much of the shortterm gain that i want to have communication very important learning you have to keep learning every single day and taking initiative when i say take initiative what do you think this means let me ask you this question what do you think it means when i say take initiative what does that mean what does that mean to start okay what else does it mean what else does it mean what do you guys think to be proactive that's right so when i say take initiative a lot of times when i am talking to what's up with developers a lot of developers can be something something called a yes people i call them yes man or just yes people in general okay and basically the way it kind of works is like hey can you build this for me yes hey can you do this for me yes hey is it do you think this is okay yes do you think this feature is good yes i say screw that okay i'm going to say yes when i think it's appropriate now what does that mean that means that i'm going to take initiative on the projects that actually make sense if for example a manager comes up to me and says hey nas can we build a feature i want us to build this feature the next two weeks what is the right answer to that tell me what is it what is the right answer if somebody comes up to you and says hey nas can you build this for me you know for the next two weeks what is your answer somebody said no i just said stop working yes i said [ __ ] yes yes let's do this let me check my schedule so actually here's what i say sam you got it my friend that's right let me look into it and i will let you know let's figure out if what you're trying to build is all actually going to help you achieve your goal too many people when they go into this they think hey i need this feature i need to do this i do this and that and that and they think that's going to actually help them achieve their goal if the goal for example of a specific thing they want to do is i want to to increase engagement on the website or something like that and they come up with a stupid stupid like a interesting way that will not let them do it it's not going to help and you're going to waste a lot of time so instead let's put okay goals on a pedestal what i will say to this person is like okay thank you appreciate it but let's take a look at if what you're trying to build is also actually going to achieve your goal let's figure what your actual goal is and if it's not going to achieve your goal let's figure out what will achieve your goal that's the simplest just put it okay another way to say is like this hey nas or hinas do you want to build the future great let me go ahead and figure out if it's actually going to achieve our goals and let me take a look at how long this will take us and i'll get back to you simple as that you are somebody who's taking initiative that's why i like to use that word how to learn to code okay you can either be anybody here who's this person anybody here this person raise your hand anybody here like this that's right that's frankie right there frankie is this person right here that's frankie right anybody hear this person anybody raise your hand darwin rohith maria maria really come on maria [Laughter] so i was like no jayden said i have my moments nah i have an ultra wide chris says no okay well if you are that's okay i've been there multiple times it's okay all right and there's this person anybody here is this person right here anybody here who's this person craig says sometimes not even close definitely not me jennifer jeff says me no le man yes says yes so guys we actually want to be more on this side we want to be those curious kids who say how can we solve this how can we get this you know you know that kid you know like a little you know everybody anybody has has kids everybody has kids and we have kids you know how sometimes kids are i'll have kids i have a sister so that's so that's how i'm getting my perspective okay i have a sister but when she was little she just wouldn't would no matter what she wants she will cry at it she wants it she will get it no matter what if she wouldn't chocolate she will go for it no matter what right so they can be very very whiny sometimes and very i mean in a way like annoying not annoying but like whiny like isn't they want it and they will do anything to get it that kind of needs to be us sometimes in a weird way we need to think about hey what can we do what are the possibilities we need to do to actually get what we want god says as you were talking about my case that's funny right so there you go now here is the road map to actually like a there's there's something called a full stack developer right here so for example if you're a force developer you get to learn something like front end right here uh backend databases devops you don't necessarily need to learn these don't focus on these you know but you would focus on something like this now some of you might want to actually focus first on front end this might be your option you want to focus on right so this might be something easier for you someone some of you might want to focus on back end right here okay and some of you might want to focus on the database right here now each of these individually are very important and each of these individually are also have a lot of results okay now if you just focus on one though number one you might get the results faster you might get your job faster when i first started i first started with this right here i then moved on to this and then of course while learning this i was learning this together but my first start was simply just this right here that was my first start okay nice so again what do we need to learn html javascript you know react.js firebase these are things you need to learn to actually you know get or to learn to become a front developer so like hi nas dislike the help is this david uh he put a uh that's funny david okay so now guys here's the big difference okay guys there's html the css and javascript and in this five day challenge we're going to be learning all of these okay so html is kind of like the bones right so for example if you look at for example i'm going to use the example here craig okay craig right correct your bones right is the structure right underneath the skin your bone is the structure that my friends is the html raise your hand if you understand that with me yes or no you get it good now whatever you get dressed up with for example if you get dressed up and you put on clothes for example i have a nice tshirt right now i have this tshirt i have maybe you know the color of my hair you know um you know maybe what jeans i got that my friends is your css it is your presentation and your appearance okay now the javascript is the funky part who here likes to dance anybody hey let's go retro that's what i'm talking about yeah salsa so really joe you like the salsa no way i didn't know that yeah i liked this i liked it and salsa too but yeah javascript is the movement it is what makes everything work that's right so javascript is like how the way this guy's dancing you're doing you you you know that is the javascript it is what makes everything dynamic html is a structure css is the presentation what makes it all work is javascript that's right sam says i like eating salsa me too i like eating salsa too especially with chips chips and salsa great combination that's right okay next up so ken when we are learning uh html what i want you guys to focus on is very much learn the basics make a page make it work okay do not over complicate it too many people that i talk to all the time they say hey nas it took me one month to learn html css i took this one course and i focused the whole whole month on html css i'm like why i can teach you html and css in one week max you don't need to learn all of that that's what i'm trying to get to so don't over complicate keep it simple again this is what html says it looks like anybody have seen this before raise your hand just really curious anybody yeah and originally if you did not have never seen this before now actually have you not seen this before anybody yeah so we have a few people who have not seen this before nice nice nice so what this is this is html page and the way html is structure is very simple every html website has a doctype html which is saying that this this is an html document starts out with html tag then we have a heading tag anybody know what the heading tag is anybody know this tag right here heading tag anybody yeah that's right so yeah j so the heading tag the heading tag is very simple but jay i like your microphone looks really cool um so the heading tag is very simple the heading tag is what uh basically all the little behind the scenes stuff going on so you might include things like javascript in there you might include the css in there you might include the title in there and then we have the body anybody know what the body is raise your hand anybody know the body is nice good so let's cool them on nice job the body guys is your h1 tags it's your p tags the body is your actual foreign website it is your structure your divs it is how your your actual webs is going to look like the head as literally imagine this the head is literally your head okay the head is literally your head it's like there's a lot of stuff that's going on behind the scenes you don't really notice it okay the body is actually your body right the head controls the body just think about that way okay now of course we got css again again very simple do not over complicate this learn how to use different layouts flexbox write this one down flexbox guys very very very popular and very important flexbox okay and of course we have responsive design and then we have media queries here guys okay so that my friends is the different ways nice and of course we have navigation we have uh this is how css looks like again we will get to learn how to use that today or the next few days beautiful javascript now of course with javascript it's a lot more difficult javascript is not as easy as something you might think not as easy as something you might think at all okay all right so instead what i want you guys to do is we're going to what i want to focus on is how to master the fundamentals right how to master the data types functions es6 dom manipulation scope data structures algorithms fetch api all those small things you need to learn now html is going to be easy for you this right here is hard that's right this is the hardest part but this is also the most important part you need to learn my friends data structures algorithms this is what you'll be tested on the actual interview your down manipulation your functions this is what you use every single day when you create javascript applications your fetch api same thing your data types same thing what we want to do guys is the following and i like to use this terminology okay let me go and exit this out when we go ahead let me say this i'm going to build a house right now looks like this you see this house right now you see this house now this house of course has a roof yes or no right it's a roof right here has a roof and of course it has some kind of foundation right like it's standing on the ground right of course this is your ground right here and underneath the ground of course i'm not sure exactly what it is but it's like it has a foundation yes or no correct what do you think is this foundation i'm not a retro i'm not a i'm not a house builder the job that's right so your foundation is actually the fundamentals of javascript it is the fundamentals of html it is the fundamentals of css it is the fundamentals of js of javascript guys that is your foundation and if you don't learn these foundations if you don't learn the functions if you don't learn the manipulation the scope the data structures the algorithms the fetch api you know all the different aspects that make coding possible then my friends if you don't learn this let me ask you if you have a shitty foundation what kind of a house can you build a shitty house that's right it's like you're building a roof when there's no house and would you want to live on a roof i mean some of you might want to do that but would you want to live in a roof no you would not right so what our goal is is hey you know what we need to focus on this foundation to focus on building this foundation so well so good that the rest becomes then we can build beautiful uh maybe we can have we can add furniture to this looking at a bar stool table again i'm horrible at drawing but you get my point right who knows right maybe we will you know rooms want to have this foundation down the other stuff is 10 times easier guys next up to again this is how javascript looks like again you will learn javascript as we continue on going with this okay so let's go ahead let's talk about the frameworks guys now javascript itself is very useful but javascript is not useful if you want to build big applications okay if you just learn javascript this is where after javascript will need to actually once you've run the javascript portion we need to now go into something called frameworks so framework is the following okay framework is example there's angular that's built by google then there is things like view view is actually built by somebody who created react.js actually view was built by somebody who created angular my bad and then there is react gs now we focus on react gs because it's one of the most popular ones it's the easiest one to grasp personally i think so and a lot of people start to use it now anybody know why anybody know why anybody know why let me see this here oh anybody know why specifically you need a framework tell me why reusable components on kit set you guys tell what do you guys think we need to use to build the rest on it that's right make your code easier understandable that's right samuel said because not said so far fast yeah well if you want to build applications like facebook right if you want to build a place like facebook you know there's a lot of pages that are used so for example the javascript application of course might use an html page like this might have the header you know the body but the thing is like for example you might have a navigation bar which is reused on every single page and it's the same navigation bar everywhere so with javascript it's really hard to reuse the same little components but with frameworks like react.js which make things a lot easier it is what makes what allows us to build amazing applications like facebook your current facebook app guys that you're using on the web is built with react gs that's right it is built with reactor yes my friends okay so if you think about it the react gs is like the icing for the cake it is what makes it beautiful makes it taste good you know otherwise if it's just like better yeah i don't want that am i right am i right somebody said is to hold up your body that's right nice so again some companies are using these different frameworks we've got for example um let me go ahead and do this we've got for example angularjs we've got react.js of ugs so airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox are all using react.js on top of for example of course facebook facebook now user very chess as well the guardian upwork paypal starting uses angularjs view alibaba grammarly you know gitlab and so forth right so a lot of the companies are using these frameworks to build their applications okay next up okay now so which should you choose well again why we choose react is because it is one of those popular ones now i want to let you know guys that again as you're learning this please right now please don't jump into reactor yes and and think that you need to learn this first please don't do that you will you are shooting yourself in the foot anybody here who's learned a framework before they actually learn the foundations first or learn javascript first darwin said yes retro anybody else i was saying yes and it's hell yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so what happens it's like you're trying to put the icing when there's no cake we want to learn the foundations first which makes things later on so much easier with react to yes roger said well i tried to learn react before learning jess and how was that retro let me know in the chat i'm just curious let me say retro is like a nightmare that's right it's because we did not know think about it this react gs was built on javascript by the way i don't know if you guys know but it's using javascript underneath the hood so a lot of its functionality it's all using js but you're trying to learn crazy functionality where you don't know what it's built on so we want to learn
