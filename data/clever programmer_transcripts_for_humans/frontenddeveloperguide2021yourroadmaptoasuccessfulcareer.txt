01:51 - so much
01:51 - so here's where the fun begins and if
01:53 - you're thinking where do i
01:55 - begin right it doesn't matter just start
01:58 - i think that's the really important
01:59 - thing
02:00 - now let's just get straight into it so
02:01 - what's happening here sonny
02:03 - right so guys like we always get this
02:04 - question of like are we talking about
02:06 - front end are we talking about back end
02:07 - today everything we cover guys is going
02:10 - to be
02:10 - front end and what do we mean by front
02:12 - end right we mean what you're going to
02:13 - see on the websites
02:14 - all of the builds that we're doing are
02:16 - front-end builds at the moment um and
02:18 - then if we
02:19 - click on the uh click on the next i
02:21 - think the javascript should pop up right
02:22 - now
02:23 - yeah um and basically guys whenever we
02:26 - talk about javascript we're talking
02:28 - about the front end whenever you hear
02:29 - about node.js we're talking about
02:31 - back-end right so back-end is some
02:32 - server somewhere else
02:33 - but it's not the website that you're
02:35 - seeing when you're interacting with like
02:37 - amazon when you're interacting with
02:38 - twitter and those sort of things
02:40 - the back end is separate we're going to
02:41 - be talking about that in a different
02:43 - video
02:43 - today everything we talk about is front
02:45 - end right so just know that before we
02:47 - jump into this video
02:48 - love it karthik says your content is
02:51 - more worth
02:52 - than any other paid courses out there
02:55 - really appreciate that
02:56 - okay so here is what's going on so we
03:00 - got html css and javascript and what is
03:03 - what is what are we looking at why is
03:04 - this important
03:05 - right so these are the fundamentals guys
03:07 - that we're going to be covering so
03:09 - the three main things that you need to
03:11 - know about when it comes to front and
03:12 - web development
03:13 - are html css and javascript they are the
03:15 - three
03:16 - power points in this uh in this
03:18 - presentation they are literally
03:19 - everything that you need to be
03:21 - like concentrated on on getting better
03:23 - at when it comes to front end
03:24 - development
03:24 - 100 and now let's talk about job
03:27 - opportunities and salary for front-end
03:29 - developers guys so here are the salaries
03:31 - for javascript developers by experience
03:33 - and like take a look at this right
03:35 - less than one year of experience it's
03:37 - possible for people to make 62 000
03:39 - a year and in 2020 75 000
03:43 - a year and then going down you know one
03:45 - to four years you can see the salaries
03:47 - keep increasing but i know most of the
03:49 - people that are watching this channel
03:50 - have
03:50 - less than one year of experience so if
03:53 - you just put your head down
03:55 - not complain don't look up don't change
03:58 - your focus every two minutes
04:00 - and just put in the work i'm talking
04:02 - eight to ten hours or more
04:04 - per day if you can do that it's very
04:06 - possible for you to be hitting these
04:08 - numbers actually even
04:09 - way before the one year mark
04:13 - definitely and guys some of you might be
04:15 - wondering it's in dollars and i'm not in
04:16 - america
04:17 - it does not matter guys with the
04:18 - internet you can pretty much work for
04:20 - anyone your client could be in america
04:22 - and you could get paid in dollars so
04:23 - this applies to everyone
04:24 - yep it applies to everyone so the job
04:27 - opportunity
04:28 - is really crazy there are 45 000 jobs
04:29 - available as of right this second on
04:31 - justindeed.com for javascript
04:33 - on upwork if you look there are 8 000
04:35 - jobs available and you guys can go there
04:37 - right now and they're probably even more
04:39 - because of kovitz so guys job
04:40 - opportunities only going
04:42 - up while a lot of people are losing
04:44 - their jobs that are doing a lot of
04:45 - physical stuff programmers are not
04:48 - exactly here you have what's going on
04:51 - here and we just got a 400 repeat
04:53 - donation
04:54 - from simba so thank you so much for that
04:56 - he says learn a lot today finish your
04:58 - instagram clone today
04:59 - uh quality content for free and i think
05:02 - this is about five dollars or six
05:04 - dollars usd so thank you so much
05:07 - nice now what are we looking at here
05:09 - sonny
05:10 - so we're looking at sort of the
05:12 - different um programming languages in
05:14 - terms of popularity guys
05:15 - so in terms of professional developers
05:17 - you can see at the top at the top two
05:19 - right now javascript html css
05:22 - those were those three that we just
05:23 - mentioned before in regards to front end
05:25 - development and you can see
05:26 - they've overtaken java they've overtaken
05:28 - python they've overtaken sql so if
05:29 - you're ever in that question
05:31 - of wondering what do what should i learn
05:33 - should i learn java should i learn this
05:34 - and that
05:35 - guys put your energy towards javascript
05:37 - html css and like we said there's plenty
05:39 - of money
05:40 - that's what you need to know moving
05:41 - can't go wrong with that
05:43 - now when we were talking earlier about
05:45 - different countries right
05:46 - it doesn't matter if you're in india
05:48 - you're in turkey you're in
05:50 - i don't know god knows where you're

06:07 - thousand a year canada they're making
06:09 - about four thousand united kingdom

08:05 - as we possibly can yep with that said
08:07 - let's just go
08:08 - right back so now this is the overall
08:11 - lay of the land so to speak when you
08:13 - think about a front-end developer
08:15 - there's a lot going on
08:16 - and now as we get more advanced you know
08:18 - back in the day maybe it was just you
08:19 - needed an html css
08:21 - and maybe javascript and your friend and
08:22 - developer now guys it's definitely a lot
08:25 - more involved
08:26 - because a lot of jobs expect you to know
08:28 - a lot of things so
08:30 - you got to learn the tools like npm
08:32 - webpack chrome dev tools this is some
08:34 - of the stuff that we're going to be
08:35 - covering in this presentation today
08:38 - you got to know html you gotta know css
08:41 - and pre
08:41 - pro processors like post css less and
08:44 - sas
08:45 - or scss you guys will need to know
08:47 - frameworks like angular
08:49 - or view or react which one kind of do
08:51 - you want to pick
08:52 - right you will need to know things like
08:54 - javascript or typescript
08:57 - and you will need to know about
08:58 - component libraries what's your flavor
09:00 - of choice is it bootstrap we talked
09:02 - about bootstrap 5 actually
09:04 - yesterday is a semantic ui or material
09:07 - ui you know
09:08 - where are you at exactly and i see a lot
09:11 - of questions about typescript guys we
09:12 - will be covering all of the things that
09:14 - you guys see here in this video
09:16 - so stay tuned and uh be sure that we are
09:18 - going to cover those
09:19 - yeah prince says in this lockdown i've
09:20 - learned a lot of things from you guys
09:22 - thanks to both of you for all of this
09:23 - free
09:24 - valuable content thank you so much thank
09:27 - you dude
09:28 - pretty cool now what can you do with
09:30 - javascript
09:31 - sunny oh nice we just got a three pound
09:34 - donation by is
09:37 - thank you dude appreciate thank you
09:39 - seriously appreciate that guys that's
09:41 - huge
09:42 - massive right so guys what can we do
09:44 - with javascript right we can do a bunch
09:46 - of things we can build web apps which
09:48 - you guys have seen in our amazing live
09:49 - builds
09:50 - hope you guys are enjoying those by the
09:51 - way you can build some native apps so
09:53 - not by learning something like react you
09:55 - can actually go ahead and build
09:56 - ios android apps which is amazingly
09:58 - powerful and you can actually go ahead
10:00 - and then take it further
10:02 - and have server apps using node.js so
10:04 - that is a back-end technology that we're
10:06 - talking about
10:06 - um but yeah pretty much with one
10:08 - language javascript you can go ahead and
10:10 - do all of this stuff so
10:11 - amazing now let's get into the
10:15 - technical nitty-gritty guys nice
10:19 - we just threw that in there because we
10:20 - love sonny's british accent so when he
10:21 - says
10:23 - we love that we all love that drop a
10:25 - like for that accent
10:27 - now what's going on so here guys when it
10:29 - comes to this you got to learn the
10:31 - basics okay with html
10:33 - make a page make it work don't over
10:35 - complicate it
10:36 - so that's just the basic foundation
10:38 - right
10:39 - yeah keep it simple just get html up and
10:42 - running on your page and literally that
10:43 - just means like get some stuff
10:44 - on a page and that's it move and then
10:47 - move to start moving forward like
10:48 - don't over complicate it don't start
10:50 - thinking all these other things just get
10:51 - moving with it and then move over
10:53 - to css so css is cascading
10:56 - stylesheet and that's on the next slide
10:59 - and here guys you want to learn how to
11:01 - use different layouts so how do you
11:02 - position things on the page in different
11:04 - ways
11:04 - and for that you can learn flexbox and
11:07 - flexbox is going to help you achieve a
11:08 - really nice responsive design
11:10 - and then you compare that with media
11:11 - queries to get things working
11:13 - just as you want it on like mobile
11:15 - tablet and everything like that so
11:17 - something to look into uh it's
11:18 - definitely a massive fundamental here
11:20 - css
11:21 - yup 100 learn that now with javascript
11:25 - you guys got to make sure you master the
11:26 - fundamentals
11:28 - learn the basics learn them inside out
11:30 - learn problem solving learn things like
11:32 - data types learn things like
11:34 - functions and es6 versus es7
11:37 - so for example what is that arrow
11:39 - looking thing right
11:41 - that's more es6 es7 as in before there
11:44 - would just be regular functions so
11:45 - learn those things because those are
11:47 - very common at every job you'll need to
11:48 - know them
11:49 - learn about dom manipulation learn about
11:51 - scopes and fetch api
11:53 - and learn a lot about asynchronous
11:55 - programming lolo
11:57 - thank you so much for another donation
12:00 - and he says what's the statistics on
12:01 - degree and no degree jobs
12:03 - i think at this point guys if you have
12:06 - the skills down it doesn't matter
12:08 - whether you have the degree or no degree
12:09 - there are tons of developers working at
12:12 - facebook at microsoft at google at
12:16 - netflix who don't have degrees
12:18 - and are making upwards of 200 or even
12:20 - 300 000
12:21 - a year yeah even elon musk just said
12:24 - that he pretty much ruled out the need
12:25 - for a degree now so
12:27 - yeah official companies are rolling out
12:28 - yeah yeah so that's huge
12:30 - so now what about the visual design
12:33 - stuff guys that's so important
12:35 - so let's jump straight into that
12:37 - actually so let's talk about
12:39 - some of the visual design stuff that we
12:41 - think is actually super important we'll
12:43 - start from the start
12:45 - yeah so there are five key principles of
12:47 - good design and suddenly you want to
12:48 - talk about some of them
12:50 - yeah so guys the first one is visual
12:52 - hierarchy so this is all about oh and
12:54 - one
12:54 - one thing actually just before we go
12:56 - into it uh
12:57 - guys this slide these slides were made
13:00 - by somebody on the team alex who's
13:02 - actually
13:02 - the newest addition to our team at
13:04 - clever programmer and he
13:06 - is phenomenal extremely talented
13:10 - uh kid he's only 19 years old and he had
13:13 - amazing resources on the front end side
13:16 - and so we're like hey why don't you put
13:17 - together some slides so we can share it
13:19 - so is that okay if we share these with
13:21 - you guys
13:22 - i think he would be really pumped and i
13:23 - think hopefully you guys will get a lot
13:25 - of value out of this too
13:27 - yeah and also guys let's drop alex a
13:28 - massive welcome in the comment section
13:31 - welcome to this team nice that's
13:34 - actually brilliant and drop a like
13:35 - for alex yeah drop a like
13:38 - nice so the first point guys first key
13:41 - principle of design a visual hierarchy
13:43 - so this is all about
13:44 - how do you rank elements on your page so
13:46 - here we have like a banner
13:47 - we have a header at the top and the sort
13:50 - of size and scale of these components
13:52 - they all play a different purpose like
13:53 - so for example we're always drawn
13:55 - to banners when we see like a website so
13:57 - they play a really important part
13:59 - it's really an important part of being a
14:00 - front-end developer yep and i just want
14:02 - to say guys we broke
14:03 - 700 live concurrent viewers so
14:07 - thank you guys so much that is insane
14:09 - appreciate you
14:11 - now visual hierarchy is very important
14:13 - and what's
14:14 - another thing that's super important
14:16 - right after visual hierarchy is
14:18 - actually the typography how things are
14:21 - written
14:22 - so if you take a look at how it you know
14:25 - slack replaces email inside your company
14:27 - that text matters it's bold and like
14:30 - it's kind of powerful
14:31 - you see it the size of it matters the
14:34 - styling of it matters and so
14:35 - typography is something you kind of have
14:37 - to know and if you look on the left hand
14:39 - side it says
14:40 - the style of fonts you use in your
14:41 - design can really impact your visual
14:43 - composition
14:44 - you can either help a message stand out
14:46 - with heavier weighted fonts
14:48 - or bring characters closer together to
14:50 - help the message feel more pronounced
14:52 - and i think when we see how it says try
14:55 - slack see the demo
14:56 - when we see where it says keep
14:57 - conversations organized in slack when
14:59 - you see slack replaces email
15:01 - how all of those are together and how
15:02 - typography is used it's very powerful
15:05 - yeah definitely definitely so typography
15:08 - super important guys and the next one is
15:10 - color so as you can see from this
15:12 - webpage immediately
15:13 - that thing just looks gorgeous like as
15:15 - soon as you see it it just
15:16 - grabs your eyes it grabs your full focus
15:19 - that's going to make
15:19 - all the difference guys now color is not
15:21 - just as simple as picking a color right
15:23 - you need to have like how do you figure
15:25 - out which colors to use how do you
15:26 - figure out which color palettes
15:27 - so on the next side we have a really
15:29 - handy tool that we actually used
15:31 - internally and it's called
15:32 - i don't know how you pronounce it i
15:33 - think it's coolers.com right rulers.co
15:35 - yeah yeah and cause you've used this
15:38 - right this is
15:39 - awesome you guys this is one tool that i
15:41 - think all designers should use and as a
15:43 - matter of fact i think i'm just going to
15:44 - open
15:44 - and go ahead and show it on the computer
15:47 - and how you use it
15:49 - but this thing is super powerful logan
15:51 - is here he goes my
15:52 - boy's dropping the value bomb let's go i
15:55 - mean you already know bro it's every day
15:57 - bro
15:57 - like the jake paul song he's actually
16:00 - there uh
16:00 - fbi just raided his house yesterday so
16:03 - let's go start the generator over here
16:07 - and this thing is awesome for colors i
16:10 - am not a front-end developer but even i
16:11 - was using this and this is awesome so
16:12 - check it out right
16:13 - if you want to pick a color that's good
16:15 - you can just click
16:17 - and how does it do that random
16:18 - generation again don't i think it's
16:22 - yeah so look i'm just pressing space bar
16:24 - and it's giving me these different
16:25 - colors and color palettes
16:27 - and so i'll keep going until i actually
16:28 - find something that kind of
16:30 - speaks out to me and um i want to use so
16:33 - let's
16:34 - even if you find the color you can lock
16:36 - that color and then you can keep
16:37 - you can keep sharpening so i like this
16:39 - orange because that's kind of like the
16:40 - clever programmer orange so now i can
16:42 - actually just do
16:44 - i can click it and it just locked it
16:46 - okay i could have also done command
16:47 - three
16:48 - command two will lock this one the
16:49 - second one so i'll just do command three
16:51 - and lock it
16:52 - now i just hit space bar and that orange
16:54 - will stay locked in but i've picked it
16:56 - now maybe i want something
16:57 - really sharp and crazy uh i like purples
17:01 - a lot so i'll lock this one too so now i
17:02 - have two of my colors and color palette
17:04 - picked
17:05 - and if i keep going you know this is you
17:07 - guys can see how this can be super
17:09 - useful for your website design logo
17:11 - design
17:12 - uh brand that you're trying to create
17:13 - whatever it may be
17:15 - yeah really really handy tool guys and
17:17 - it's really handy when you're just
17:18 - starting out in your sort of
17:19 - front-end journey because it's hard to
17:20 - figure out these things like the colors
17:22 - that you should use and stuff so
17:23 - definitely go ahead and check that out
17:25 - yep so coolers dot co is a great
17:27 - resource now what
17:28 - do we have uh here on this one sunny
17:31 - right so here we have contrast guys so
17:34 - you can see like
17:35 - so we talked about colors but look how
17:36 - they use the colors right look how
17:38 - they're contrasting different colors
17:39 - together
17:40 - and how it draws your attention to each
17:42 - of those three different uh items on the
17:43 - screen so
17:44 - contrast is something which could is
17:46 - really really important and how to know
17:48 - which colors
17:48 - that complement one another so in in
17:51 - that case you i think coolest does that
17:52 - by default so you notice whenever we're
17:54 - going through our palette
17:55 - it kind of with colors that was just
17:57 - seem naturally to fit together
17:58 - so use tools like that to sort of get a
18:01 - grasp of contrast
18:02 - but super important yeah and hari
18:04 - krishan just donated
18:06 - four dollars so thank you so much for
18:08 - that
18:09 - really really appreciate you that is
18:11 - freaking awesome good
18:12 - thank you and there's a good comment
18:15 - that came
18:16 - in from david breck and he actually says
18:19 - coolers is the best i used it for my
18:21 - final project last semester and it was
18:22 - looking
18:23 - really nice awesome awesome
18:26 - nice okay so let's move forward with
18:29 - this
18:30 - so number five grid systems these are
18:32 - really important now you guys hear us
18:34 - talking about grid systems in material
18:36 - ui
18:37 - or not just material ui but regular css
18:40 - we talked about grid
18:41 - and then even with bootstrap we talked
18:42 - about grid a lot
18:44 - and it's an important thing when you're
18:46 - designing
18:47 - you know even when you think about photo
18:49 - composition right you're thinking about
18:50 - rules of third
18:52 - rules of third is a grid system
18:54 - essentially
18:55 - so here for your own website design
18:59 - i think a grid system is important you
19:00 - want to add something on the grid system
19:02 - sony
19:03 - yeah so massive power here guys even for
19:06 - achieving responsive designs
19:08 - using a grid system allows you to
19:09 - actually really easily achieve that that
19:11 - sort of design that you're looking for
19:13 - so
19:13 - i know we talk a lot about flexbox but
19:15 - if you go ahead and master something
19:16 - like css grid
19:17 - achieving a responsive design is
19:18 - actually super super uh it's like it's
19:21 - very
19:21 - easy to do that with css grid so
19:23 - definitely something worth
19:24 - uh investing your time in and learning
19:26 - together
19:28 - lira fernandez says sunny plus cause the
19:30 - ultimate duo thank you and resvan says
19:33 - love your guys's content appreciate it
19:34 - brother so thank you
19:36 - next up now with gr i think grid systems
19:38 - is
19:39 - all important but like what kind of
19:41 - tools can you guys
19:42 - use to actually prototype grid systems
19:44 - and prototype
19:46 - and come up with design ideas for your
19:48 - website before you start coding it up
19:50 - so this is why we put this slide
19:52 - together for you guys
19:53 - tools for prototyping and um go ahead
19:57 - yeah just gonna say just how we say guys
19:59 - before you even write a line of code
20:01 - you should kind of like get an idea
20:02 - write it down on a piece of paper what
20:04 - you're trying to do right
20:05 - we do the same thing with design like
20:07 - with sketch with envision
20:09 - with adobe xd and and figma um pretty
20:12 - much
20:12 - you you that's what you go ahead and do
20:14 - you draw it out as you want to
20:16 - achieve your website they provide tools
20:17 - which allow you to
20:19 - go ahead and easily sort the layout
20:20 - without any code or anything
20:22 - and then you have something to work
20:23 - towards so this is
20:25 - this is adobe xd this is indesign
20:28 - uh this is envision envision got it this
20:32 - is figma over here and then this one is
20:34 - sketch yep
20:35 - yeah so design it first you guys before
20:38 - sometimes you just start creating though
20:40 - like
20:40 - oftentimes i personally kind of just
20:42 - jump into it but also i'm not
20:44 - a professional front end designer you
20:46 - know our front end developer so
20:48 - i think if you use these tools you make
20:49 - your uh development a lot better
20:52 - definitely definitely now here are some
20:54 - adobe
20:55 - xd resources so there's some go ahead
20:58 - you want to talk about it
21:00 - yeah so we have app integration guys
21:01 - slack jira
21:03 - um i can't remember what the last one
21:04 - was that well that's nice so you when
21:06 - you're designing you can actually just
21:08 - shoot it to your team in slack
21:09 - yeah and i actually worked in a company
21:11 - where they did this every time a design
21:13 - was updated it would ping in slack
21:14 - and i'd get the latest design really
21:16 - really handy stuff even ui kits guys so
21:19 - like
21:19 - all the apple designs all the microsoft
21:21 - designs all those things are
21:23 - built into these platforms so you can go
21:25 - ahead and get the apple layout as you
21:27 - just expect it
21:28 - uh um so alex actually went ahead and
21:30 - told me about one of the plugins for
21:31 - example if you want to have confetti on
21:33 - the screen
21:33 - or confetti on your design sometimes
21:35 - that can be quite hard to actually go
21:36 - ahead and add to your designs
21:38 - so there's little handy plugins that you
21:39 - can go ahead and install so just a quick
21:41 - showcase of the thing
21:42 - you can nice yep and then apparently it
21:46 - has a plug-in of air table
21:47 - and plug in a react so that's also
21:50 - sounds pretty handy and then it got ui
21:52 - kits for apple if you're developing for
21:54 - them
21:55 - or microsoft so this is awesome now
21:58 - also i think what's important that alex
22:00 - was telling me too
22:01 - it goes you got to have inspiration
22:03 - resources
22:04 - so where can you go and get inspiration
22:06 - from because one thing i see with
22:07 - front-end developers and why they
22:09 - sometimes they have good intentions but
22:11 - it end up ends up being bad
22:13 - because they're coming up with
22:14 - everything uniquely on their own and
22:16 - sometimes that's why your design will be
22:18 - bad
22:18 - so have inspirations to derive from so
22:21 - then you can actually create something
22:22 - really powerful and good
22:24 - yeah steve mccarthy says my front ends
22:27 - look like 1990s web pages
22:29 - i think every developer can relate to
22:30 - you on that and that's why we use
22:32 - the sort of things that we're about to
22:34 - speak about nice
22:36 - got it this is that's actually really
22:38 - small um that's funny because my
22:40 - stuff looks like that too and here is
22:42 - mostly search which is
22:43 - pinterest for designers have you ever
22:45 - used the sunny
22:47 - so i'm not using muesli i've used the
22:48 - one that we're going to speak about next
22:50 - but i definitely
22:51 - when alex mentioned this i'm going to
22:52 - check this one out sure yeah
22:54 - yep so this is like pinterest for
22:55 - designers and you guys can actually type
22:57 - in whatever keywords that you're looking
22:59 - for right and then inspirations will pop
23:02 - up and i think they have like landing
23:03 - pages and all that type of stuff
23:05 - for you to get inspiration from so i
23:08 - would definitely make
23:09 - mosley search one of your guys's
23:11 - resources for front end design and even
23:13 - sunny and i will personally add it to
23:15 - our toolbox yeah
23:17 - like guys they have like three and a
23:18 - half thousand dashboards ten thousand
23:20 - landing pages mobile app designs
23:22 - even if you have a rough idea of what
23:24 - your app should look like there's no
23:25 - harm in going and checking out
23:27 - a bunch of designs to see what could be
23:28 - improved you know yep
23:30 - 100 and guys i think we just broke 900
23:34 - concurrent
23:34 - viewers so thank you guys so much that
23:37 - is
23:38 - massive appreciate the love guys let's
23:40 - keep that energy up and let's keep
23:42 - getting this video out to even more
23:43 - people and you can just do that
23:45 - if you're here and you haven't liked the
23:47 - video already go ahead and just like the
23:49 - video and then it sends it out to more
23:51 - developers and more people who want to
23:52 - become developers
23:54 - thank you guys awesome thank you so here
23:57 - we have so the chrome extension for
23:59 - mosley is available too so you guys can
24:01 - just download it i believe for free
24:02 - and install it on chrome so you can do
24:05 - that it's called muesli to
24:06 - stay inspired and it has over 300 000
24:09 - plus active users
24:11 - yeah really handy now let's jump into
24:13 - some design resources
24:15 - so sunny take it away the first one that
24:17 - we have here guys is a design blog by
24:19 - adobe so it's completely free to go
24:21 - ahead and read this
24:22 - subscribe to it and what we always do is
24:24 - we actually recommend this with
24:25 - javascript so
24:26 - there's a few javascript newsletters and
24:27 - that's what i personally use
24:29 - to stay at the front of the javascript
24:31 - and what's latest and what's going on so
24:33 - this is the exact same thing but for
24:34 - design and as a front-end developer
24:36 - super important guys it's going to teach
24:38 - you the latest processes the latest
24:40 - principles
24:41 - and also what the latest companies are
24:42 - doing in regards to design right so
24:45 - really really important
24:46 - to stay up to like in front of the in
24:48 - front of the crowd when it comes to this
24:50 - stuff
24:50 - like the type of stuff that i'm looking
24:52 - at right now that seems actually pretty
24:53 - powerful to me i mean
24:55 - that stuff's just catching my eyes
24:56 - unique insights so for example i want to
24:59 - know about interviews
25:00 - and how did they interview people based
25:02 - on design how did somebody pass the
25:04 - interview
25:05 - based on that i think that seems pretty
25:08 - amazing for somebody who's looking for a
25:10 - job
25:11 - yep definitely here are some great
25:14 - free design resources you guys and so
25:17 - if you have any um you want to add
25:19 - anything sunny feel free to
25:21 - jump in at any time but yeah so we have
25:24 - behance and dribble
25:25 - for those yeah i'm just going gonna say
25:27 - behance is one i gotta
25:29 - put in my uh repertoire as well but
25:32 - behance is absolutely amazing you guys
25:34 - so make sure you guys
25:35 - add that as one of your resources and
25:37 - then the next one is actually dribble
25:39 - dribble is
25:40 - amazing let me actually just open up
25:43 - because i have
25:44 - some experience with dribble and these
25:46 - guys
25:47 - are is triple with three b's
25:50 - it's three b's yeah three b's yeah there
25:53 - we go so it's dribble with three b's
25:55 - and you guys can go here and get
25:57 - inspirations for what you're trying to
25:59 - build so maybe let's say you're trying
26:00 - to build like
26:01 - that uh bottom nav bar or whatever on
26:04 - your mobile device and you can actually
26:06 - take a look at this
26:07 - inspiration right here or if you're
26:09 - trying to build a landing page
26:11 - you can take a look at this design yeah
26:14 - that somebody built
26:15 - you go oh that actually looks really
26:17 - great let me actually model this
26:19 - so if you look at the top and what i
26:22 - would honestly do is i would go to this
26:23 - platform
26:24 - and let's see if i can go in filters
26:27 - cool popular maybe you can go click web
26:31 - design right
26:32 - and go to the most popular web designs
26:34 - that you can see so
26:35 - say this one then just try to design
26:38 - this exact thing that looks exactly like
26:41 - that and put it in your portfolio
26:44 - see what i'm saying that will guaranteed
26:47 - work
26:47 - because it's already popping on the
26:50 - design website
26:52 - yeah one of the most popular ones the
26:54 - best thing is is that these are going to
26:55 - be less
26:56 - popular than the sort of typical sort of
26:58 - projects that you're going to see in
26:59 - everyone's portfolio so if you go here
27:01 - you're going to be sure that you have
27:02 - some pieces which stand out
27:04 - inside your portfolio and they're really
27:06 - attractive really look beautiful
27:08 - and it's also going to make you a better
27:09 - front-end developer so no harm in doing
27:11 - it
27:12 - yeah no harm in doing this like this is
27:14 - another one and i think that's a really
27:16 - good point that sunny made because
27:17 - sometimes
27:18 - if everybody is making clones of things
27:20 - sometimes your
27:21 - those people will be like well you
27:22 - probably just follow the tutorial you
27:24 - know to do this or you just follow the
27:25 - to-do list tutorial
27:27 - but here it's not everybody's doing it
27:29 - so this will also make you stand out if
27:31 - you try to exactly model these pages
27:34 - yeah that will be a really good test for
27:36 - you guys
27:37 - so let's go back to the keynote that we
27:41 - had for you guys and i think
27:43 - i mean damn we're almost at a thousand
27:45 - total viewers on all platforms
27:48 - so that is amazing unbelievable
27:51 - unbelievable thank you guys so these are
27:54 - free resources
27:55 - and then you might be wondering like how
27:57 - can i improve my visual design skills
28:00 - and this is something we just touched on
28:02 - a little bit already
28:04 - so make sure you discover creative work
28:06 - on these platforms
28:08 - i think inspiration is probably going to
28:09 - be one of the most important things
28:12 - and then you know what the next most
28:14 - important thing is even within
28:16 - inspiration right you want to find
28:19 - few people and then model them so
28:22 - tell me your thoughts on this one sonny
28:25 - i think this is a really important point
28:26 - i never thought of this until alex
28:28 - explained it to me so like
28:29 - go ahead and find some designers and
28:31 - follow them because like he mentioned to
28:33 - me it's all about pattern recognition
28:35 - if you start to see and you follow their
28:37 - designs you're going to see
28:38 - where they go from like a rounded design
28:40 - to a flat design and if you're following
28:42 - three people and all of them are moving
28:43 - in that direction
28:44 - you can you can be sure that the
28:46 - industry might be switching to that
28:47 - direction
28:48 - and it's like a queue to then learn that
28:49 - stuff and go a bit more deeper into it
28:51 - just like how you follow me follow kazee
28:53 - nars in the javascript domain
28:56 - it's just as important in like visual
28:57 - design domain that you go ahead and
28:58 - follow someone so these are
29:00 - people on dribble and alex recommended
29:02 - that you guys go and follow these so
29:04 - definitely go and check him out um and
29:05 - he's an amazing designer and he actually
29:07 - goes and follows these people as well so
29:09 - be sure to go
29:10 - it's super killer because even one of
29:12 - the things that i learned when i'm
29:14 - looking for homes is we couldn't find a
29:17 - lot of good listings so what we did is
29:19 - we found the owner
29:20 - of a home that was like nice and we hit
29:23 - up the owner and the owner just showed
29:24 - us
29:24 - all other homes that were similarly
29:27 - amazingly designed
29:29 - oh nice you know what i'm saying so i
29:31 - think with when you're looking for
29:32 - website designs
29:33 - just follow a few people and then you
29:35 - can actually start to develop that same
29:37 - eye
29:38 - as them and you will guaranteed almost
29:41 - always find
29:42 - good principle designs because you're
29:43 - following the right people
29:45 - definitely and the next one is sunny
29:48 - what is this
29:49 - go ahead and build some app clones guys
29:52 - so
29:52 - if you haven't already we have actually
29:54 - gone ahead and built all of the clones
29:56 - on the screen right now
29:57 - so which is amazing to say that really
29:59 - nice yeah you guys so nice to look at it
30:02 - yeah it's really nice you guys can go
30:04 - ahead and build those and go and check
30:06 - them out and that's going to help you
30:07 - become a better
30:08 - front-end developer and it's going to
30:09 - help you improve your skill set so
30:11 - seriously and it's going to it's going
30:12 - to be something you add to your
30:13 - portfolio so definitely go ahead and
30:14 - check those because we built netflix we
30:16 - built tinder clone just a few days ago
30:18 - we built spotify cloned
30:20 - we built tick-tock clone and instagram
30:22 - clone so these are all websites that we
30:24 - built
30:24 - and the front end for them so what
30:26 - better than to have these on your
30:28 - portfolio
30:29 - exactly awesome so with that said we're
30:32 - gonna jump back
30:34 - into this pretty much uh right away
30:37 - thank you for the donation basil
30:39 - straight back into oh thank you
30:41 - basil islam nice and you guys we're
30:44 - about to hit a
30:45 - thousand concurrent viewers on youtube
30:48 - very soon we're at
30:49 - 971 you guys are absolutely freaking
30:51 - beautiful daniel sulliada says awesome
30:53 - stream guys i believe
30:55 - most web developers are not great
30:57 - designers would it be beneficial for a
30:59 - web dev to learn ui ux design
31:01 - and what we will say is absolutely i
31:03 - think it's one of the key components
31:04 - you could have hidden in your back
31:06 - pocket you come in as a full stack
31:08 - developer or back-end developer and then
31:10 - you just
31:11 - blow their minds with your design skills
31:13 - yeah it's what takes you from a junior
31:15 - front-end developer to a senior
31:17 - front-end developer
31:18 - having that difference in that visual
31:19 - skill yeah yep so i think it's
31:21 - absolutely killer guys thank you so much
31:24 - drop a like for the video if you're here
31:26 - and you've been enjoying this content
31:27 - let's keep
31:28 - sending it out to more and more people
31:29 - let's break that thousand mark and with
31:31 - that said
31:32 - let's continue with the value bombs
31:35 - so watching base now onto
31:39 - the back to the technical stuff guys so
31:41 - back to the technical nigrate
31:43 - what the hell is a framework guys we
31:46 - always
31:46 - are asking like which framework do i
31:48 - learn is it like
31:50 - angular view react javascript's always
31:52 - evolving it's always changing
31:54 - so how do you know which one which
31:56 - framework to start on and kazi like when
31:57 - you first entered this domain
31:58 - what was your thoughts on that i was
32:01 - very confused with all especially the
32:03 - web development
32:04 - it was just like i'm like let me just do
32:05 - python because python was just python
32:08 - and then web development was like
32:10 - view react angular this that that
32:13 - other thing and i'm like that seems like
32:15 - too much
32:16 - is going on yeah exactly there's a lot
32:19 - going on so we're gonna we're here to
32:20 - clear that up for you today guys on what
32:22 - you should focus
32:23 - all of your attention on so here are the
32:25 - most popular go ahead
32:27 - the most popular ones that we're going
32:28 - to cover guys are the first one you've
32:30 - probably heard of this angular
32:31 - it's google's uh framework right so you
32:34 - have google's framework it's very
32:35 - popular
32:36 - it grew quite a lot but it's sort of on
32:39 - the downward trend right now
32:40 - and then they had a view um i'm not
32:43 - actually sure because
32:43 - you know who actually came up with the
32:44 - view i'm not entirely sure i don't know
32:46 - who came out with
32:47 - you very lightweight uh library
32:50 - extremely sort of popular it's very
32:51 - opinionated
32:52 - um but it sort of surpassed angular and
32:55 - then the guys at facebook just came
32:57 - along and just like
32:58 - blew everyone's mind with like react
33:02 - like they came along i love this and
33:04 - they just took it to a whole new level
33:06 - you know like
33:08 - they um have we have have we gone to the
33:10 - next slide
33:11 - we're on react oh nice yeah awesome yeah
33:15 - so yeah this one
33:16 - guys this is by the guys over at
33:17 - facebook and this is obviously if you're
33:19 - not
33:19 - if you're new to the channel go ahead
33:21 - and check out the last few videos and
33:22 - we'll clear up what react is
33:24 - uh yeah so yeah massive companies are
33:26 - using all three of these right now guys
33:28 - so you've got
33:29 - airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox using
33:32 - react
33:32 - you've got guardian upwork paypal sony
33:34 - using angular and then you've got
33:35 - alibaba and a bunch of others using vue
33:37 - but how do you know
33:39 - which one to choose from these so like
33:41 - what would you look at when you were
33:42 - when you would make this decision
33:44 - that's really important i honestly a few
33:46 - things i always look at which is why i
33:48 - looked at python as well
33:49 - i look for simplicity and ease of use
33:53 - i almost put that above so many other
33:55 - things
33:56 - just because i want to know how what's
33:59 - the learning curve can i
34:00 - pick it up fast and then i also look at
34:02 - how long is this thing here to stay
34:04 - so like is it popular is it picked up by
34:06 - a lot of people and then of course i
34:08 - want to look at like what companies
34:10 - you know are using it so when i see like
34:12 - i look at the guardian and i'm like
34:13 - that's cool but airbnb is like more
34:15 - badass you know like upwork is cute but
34:18 - instagram is really where it's at yeah
34:20 - exactly
34:22 - yeah so i mean i think all of them are
34:25 - being used by popular
34:26 - but i strive for simplicity and um
34:30 - something that's just
34:32 - you know popular and trending right now
34:35 - exactly so with that said guys we went
34:37 - ahead and checked out stack overflow
34:39 - and wanted to see what the most wanted
34:41 - framework was and you guys guessed it
34:43 - right
34:43 - whoa we just broke 1 000 viewers
34:47 - concurrent we're over 1 000 viewers on
34:50 - youtube you guys are
34:51 - absolutely amazing thank you so much
34:53 - thank you guys damn
34:55 - that is amazing let's keep it rolling so
34:57 - go ahead
34:58 - thank you guys so the number one most
35:01 - wanted framework
35:02 - right now is flying with react right so
35:04 - yeah at the top
35:05 - you've got react so guys there is no
35:08 - downfall right now to learn and react
35:10 - react is here to stay
35:11 - you can be sure for the next five years
35:12 - if you learn react you're gonna have a
35:14 - job but you're gonna have some kind of
35:15 - income
35:16 - that will come from that so definitely
35:18 - worth investing your time
35:19 - yep and it's the most wanted framework
35:22 - now if we go over here you guys can see
35:24 - react is just flying off and this is
35:27 - actually like
35:28 - look this is the real download so this
35:30 - is not just some popularity this is
35:32 - literally download so take a look at
35:33 - this versus angular versus view
35:36 - and honestly a lot of the reason with
35:38 - angular is because it's too
35:39 - um it's it forces you into a framework
35:43 - and it forces you to code a certain way
35:46 - whereas with react
35:47 - it's not a framework it's just a library
35:49 - it's super lightweight
35:50 - so it's plug and play and then it's also
35:52 - a badass
35:54 - and you know you it's pretty much just
35:56 - like javascript under the hood
35:58 - yeah so next time you guys have that
36:00 - question should i learn angular should i
36:01 - learn view
36:02 - think about this like visual right here
36:04 - like angular is going off
36:06 - react is going off the chart oh there we
36:09 - go
36:09 - okay this visual right here okay i think
36:11 - you were talking about this visual
36:13 - because i'm like that other visual makes
36:15 - me not wanna
36:17 - you know if you guys loved it drop a
36:20 - thumbs up
36:21 - warrior warrior says this is insane you
36:23 - guys are lit we're always lit somebody
36:25 - also said this is like
36:26 - watching two friends just kind of give
36:27 - us advice so that's cool
36:29 - yeah i love that it is guys there's two
36:31 - friends just giving you guys advice
36:33 - amazing so what what is this over here
36:35 - right so yeah so we talked about react
36:37 - so we're gonna dive a bit more into
36:38 - react guys
36:39 - so react is all about component based
36:42 - design and what that means guys is
36:44 - literally you
36:44 - go ahead and break a website down into
36:46 - different components the header the
36:48 - navbar
36:49 - the body the text and all that goes in
36:51 - like the cards on amazon
36:52 - all of those things and you basically
36:54 - just reuse them right so it's literally
36:56 - like
36:56 - once you get the hang of that the reason
36:58 - why it's really really relates it guys
37:00 - it's actually super simple it's actually
37:01 - really easy to go ahead and reuse
37:03 - components
37:04 - so getting your head around the
37:06 - component based design is crucial
37:08 - now managing data and react like how
37:11 - does this work
37:12 - so when it comes to managing data and
37:14 - redux this is where people start to kind
37:16 - of lose their and start going crazy
37:18 - and this is why in our clones that we
37:21 - make
37:22 - like amazon clone where we use context
37:24 - api
37:25 - where we start to introduce the idea of
37:26 - redux and we
37:28 - built another tutorial i think with
37:30 - spotify where we use
37:32 - context api so this is another concept
37:35 - which introduces things like data layers
37:36 - and you needing to understand that which
37:38 - is
37:39 - super powerful and super valuable once
37:41 - you learn it and
37:42 - the step-by-step process of learning is
37:44 - learn context api
37:45 - first and then get into redux and is the
37:48 - easiest way to do it send me your
37:49 - thoughts on this
37:50 - exactly what cause you said pretty much
37:52 - so guys well the minute the minute you
37:54 - kind of hear about redux and you look at
37:55 - tutorials for redux
37:56 - this is your reaction it's pretty much
37:58 - like oh my god like it's kind of
37:59 - freaking me out and stuff
38:00 - so all we're going to say here is pretty
38:02 - much like kazi said go ahead learn the
38:04 - react context api
38:05 - first learn that pattern and then
38:08 - picking out redux is kind of easy so
38:09 - it's gonna it's gonna be a lot simpler
38:11 - than as if you were just jumping
38:12 - straight into
38:13 - redux for the first time so the next one
38:15 - yeah react context api it's going to be
38:17 - a lot
38:18 - easier to learn and pick up um and if
38:20 - you are interested
38:21 - in the builds that we've done we
38:22 - actually went ahead and done that so
38:24 - you can definitely use those as
38:25 - reference yep and you you know we have a
38:28 - free training for you guys
38:29 - profit with javascript free training so
38:31 - you guys can go ahead and
38:33 - sign up for it at any time we have a
38:35 - webinar that we've put together it's a
38:37 - one hour
38:38 - free webinar it's in the description
38:39 - below so if you guys want to go
38:41 - ahead and check that out definitely go
38:44 - ahead and sign up for it because it just
38:45 - gives you the exact road map
38:47 - to you know here we're diving deep into
38:50 - the front end developer guide in your
38:52 - roadmap in that one we're talking about
38:54 - how are you going to go from your
38:55 - zero dollars to making a hundred
38:57 - thousand dollars
38:58 - whether you do that in one year three
39:00 - years or five years it's really the road
39:02 - map
39:02 - to learning the coding skills and the
39:04 - practicality of
39:06 - your first hundred thousand dollars so i
39:08 - put that in the description below
39:11 - click that link and then sign up for
39:12 - that training it's freaking awesome
39:15 - definitely go check that out guys free
39:17 - value so definitely worth checking out
39:18 - now i included this one because i have a
39:21 - lot of people who do ask about something
39:23 - called mob
39:23 - x right i had a question about it before
39:25 - uh it says basically another
39:27 - uh opinionated version of like managing
39:29 - data within a react app
39:30 - honestly my my viewpoint here is if
39:32 - anyone has this question
39:34 - go ahead and use react context api and
39:35 - then redux if you want to do this
39:37 - it's just kind of a cool thing to learn
39:39 - but honestly if you want to land a job
39:40 - redux is the way to go got it
39:44 - and now check out the live bills that we
39:46 - have free
39:47 - on youtube all right so bruce buffer is
39:50 - endorsing us apparently and over here
39:52 - you can see we got the zoom clone i mean
39:55 - i know it's really hard for you guys to
39:56 - see but
39:57 - we got the zoom clone that we made
39:58 - recently we made a spotify clone for you
40:01 - guys
40:02 - we made the tick tock clone uh that's
40:05 - at you know in six days we have over 117
40:08 - 000 people watched that one and
40:10 - a lot of them built it out we built a
40:13 - youtube clone for you guys you can see
40:15 - the exact front-end design for youtube
40:17 - and then we also did the tinder clone
40:20 - and then
40:20 - a bunch of more stuff so go ahead and
40:23 - guys like that's
40:24 - all there for free on youtube so make
40:26 - sure you get value from that as well
40:28 - exactly and guys if you were if you've
40:30 - watched any of these and you found value
40:31 - from that just
40:32 - all we ask is you smash the thumbs up
40:34 - button and that's enough for us
40:36 - to break break the thumbs up button
40:39 - exactly
40:41 - now okay so what's this what am i
40:43 - looking at all right so next guys we
40:45 - have design libraries
40:46 - so what are design libraries they help
40:48 - us achieve that clean
40:50 - ui they help us to achieve things like
40:52 - that grid system that we spoke about
40:54 - earlier
40:55 - so here are two popular ones one's
40:56 - called material ui ones called bootstrap
40:58 - now they give us things like icon sets
41:00 - so we can use like we've used it in a
41:02 - lot of our builds
41:03 - so like having those clean flat buttons
41:05 - which have the responsive click and that
41:06 - google sort of ripple effect
41:08 - and also that responsive design both
41:10 - material ui and bootstrap are going to
41:11 - help you achieve that
41:12 - now we spoke about react both of them
41:15 - are very very heavily supported with
41:16 - react they have
41:17 - a react bootstrap and material ui out by
41:20 - default supports react so
41:22 - definitely worth something looking into
41:23 - guys
41:25 - yep awesome so now we have
41:28 - node and npm so now let's talk about
41:31 - what is node and what is npm is it on
41:34 - the next slides or do we got to talk
41:35 - about it now
41:36 - uh no it's on here so node guys in case
41:38 - you're wondering because i know it can
41:39 - be confusing when you see javascript and
41:41 - node.js you're like oh
41:43 - i mean aren't they the same thing right
41:44 - so we talked about earlier front-end
41:46 - development is in javascript
41:48 - whenever you have any back-end software
41:49 - any any code which sits on the server
41:51 - somewhere
41:52 - that's node.js so that's like living on
41:54 - a server somewhere and it runs in
41:56 - something called node.js
41:57 - now mpm is how you pull in essentially
42:00 - other packages and other modules
42:02 - into your code so if you're going to use
42:03 - material ui or bootstrap you would use
42:05 - npm now npm stands for node package
42:08 - manager and it basically
42:09 - whenever you write a piece of code that
42:11 - you want to share with others you store
42:12 - it on
42:13 - the node registry and then other people
42:15 - can go ahead and pull it
42:16 - so definitely what we do use that in
42:19 - everything
42:19 - 100 now over here we got
42:23 - npm and we got yarn and oftentimes
42:26 - people say how do i choose so how do you
42:28 - choose sunny
42:29 - right so this is very sort of
42:30 - opinionated uh yarn is
42:32 - quite a powerful one to use it's very
42:34 - clean actually and i used to be a
42:36 - firm believer in sticking with mpm but i
42:38 - would actually go ahead and use yarn but
42:40 - guys whatever you decide to use just
42:41 - stick to the one like then you can learn
42:43 - both there's no harm at all
42:44 - um but don't have your project and
42:46 - sometimes you do npm sometimes you do
42:48 - yarn
42:48 - just stick to one and that's going to be
42:51 - um you're sort of
42:52 - clear enough and and guys if you're
42:53 - going to a job and they're using yarn
42:55 - carry on using yarn if you're going to a
42:56 - job they're using npm karen using npm
42:58 - it's really not a big decision and it's
43:00 - not as scary as everyone thinks
43:02 - yep travel todd says travel tools says i
43:06 - was
43:07 - zero in react i watched all the clones
43:09 - now i know react
43:10 - context api and he says sunny's way of
43:12 - teaching is the best on youtube
43:15 - i love that thank you so much travel
43:17 - tools so go watch those
43:19 - yeah definitely go ahead and check those
43:20 - out love that now what is firebase and
43:23 - why is it so
43:24 - useful for a front-end developer now
43:26 - guys what's beautiful about
43:27 - firebase this thing is going to blow
43:29 - your mind is you actually don't even
43:31 - need
43:31 - a back-end like node you can actually do
43:35 - real-time database you can do user
43:37 - authentication
43:38 - you can do um pretty much everything you
43:41 - could do with the normal data
43:42 - including hosting your website you can
43:45 - do all of that
43:46 - with firebase yeah massive value here
43:50 - guys so firebase is provided by google
43:52 - a bunch of different tools are included
43:54 - in firebase and
43:55 - literally what kazi said is what they do
43:57 - so it's pretty much they wanted to
43:58 - alleviate and get rid of that headache
44:00 - with the back end and sort of you they
44:02 - just want you to focus on your front-end
44:04 - developer they want you to make
44:05 - beautiful apps and make it simple for
44:06 - you to deploy them
44:07 - host them handle authentication and all
44:09 - that stuff so we're going to run through
44:10 - some of the things that firebase offer
44:12 - which can help you as a front-end
44:13 - developer
44:14 - yep so firebase can do hosting
44:18 - and it also allows you to think 100
44:21 - million
44:22 - users and you guys should also think
44:23 - about 100 million users always
44:26 - so when your app has 100 million users
44:28 - can it handle it and with firebase the
44:30 - answer is yes it can actually handle it
44:32 - and it do it automatically for you
44:35 - exactly scales up scales down
44:37 - just by itself so very simple to go
44:39 - ahead and do that we also have the cloud
44:41 - of
44:41 - uh we have the real-time firestore
44:43 - database so guys
44:44 - this is amazing like power behind this
44:46 - and i don't think anyone realizes until
44:48 - you actually go ahead and play with it
44:50 - without doing any back-end stuff you get
44:52 - a real-time database so like literally
44:54 - if you've got
44:55 - messages coming through you don't have
44:56 - to do any magic behind that it will just
44:58 - come through inside
45:00 - on your front end with very minimal code
45:01 - like literally three lines of code
45:03 - and you can have something coming
45:04 - through so extreme power at the
45:06 - real-time database
45:07 - and what's up with this yeah so here
45:10 - guys
45:11 - a lot of you guys are asking about
45:12 - machine learning can we do it can we do
45:14 - it or like
45:15 - do we need python if you guys are
45:16 - interested in machine learning you can
45:18 - combine something called tensorflow.js
45:20 - which is a way of uh training models in
45:22 - machine learning
45:23 - with the uh with firebase and you can
45:25 - actually have really really powerful
45:27 - machine learning
45:28 - uh functionality with jacked front end
45:31 - developer
45:33 - yeah like all of this is like crazy guys
45:35 - like you can do all of this very simply
45:36 - and on the next slide
45:38 - there's a little diagram showing you
45:39 - about how we can train a model
45:41 - and then we can serve it using firebase
45:43 - so really powerful stuff the training is
45:45 - taking place here
45:46 - right and then serving is all happening
45:47 - with firebase and firebase is all front
45:49 - end like what
45:51 - what is happening what is life so that's
45:53 - the beautiful thing so even if you don't
45:55 - understand machine learning you're
45:55 - sitting you're going what am i looking
45:57 - at
45:58 - doesn't matter like the whole idea is
45:59 - that with firebase it's possible so even
46:01 - if you learned it later
46:02 - you could do it just to tell you how far
46:05 - you can push it with this
46:06 - authentication dude check this out
46:09 - marouche
46:10 - says sunny and kazi i got promoted
46:11 - yesterday because of learning react from
46:13 - your tinder clone
46:14 - many things it's amazing
46:17 - well done dude we love that we helped
46:19 - you out that's amazing
46:21 - uh let me actually see this um
46:25 - that's awesome yeah i got maroosa sunny
46:27 - and yeah i got promoted that's awesome
46:29 - thank you so much dude
46:30 - i'm i'm pumped for you that's huge
46:33 - we got frank in the house paton says wow
46:35 - this guy is coding in 2021
46:38 - you know us we're in the future we'll
46:40 - wait for everybody else to catch up
46:42 - guys we're all in the future everybody
46:43 - who's here it's the culture
46:45 - we're freaking driven we're grateful
46:47 - we're all pumped
46:49 - that's the culture that we're building
46:50 - in the team and i feel like that's what
46:52 - we have even in the community
46:54 - exactly on the user authentication side
46:57 - guys i imagine as a front-end developer
46:59 - you can actually add
47:00 - google authentication facebook
47:02 - authentication twitter authentication
47:04 - github regular email or even with the
47:07 - phone
47:08 - like all of this you guys can add with
47:11 - firebase
47:12 - and it's super simple to be able to do
47:14 - that with firebase
47:15 - yeah as a full stack developer guys i
47:17 - can tell you at first hand
47:19 - doing that is not a simple task but
47:21 - firebase make it
47:22 - extremely simple to do user
47:25 - authentication so save yourself the
47:26 - hassle
47:27 - use firebase when you're doing it
47:29 - exactly and thank you
47:31 - frankie for removing those messages
47:32 - because i was about to do that guys keep
47:34 - the chat positive otherwise you're going
47:35 - to get blocked
47:36 - we want the culture to be just filled
47:38 - with positive and amazing people
47:40 - so let's keep the positivity going we
47:42 - read all of your comments
47:43 - if you want to be a part of this
47:44 - community bring positivity bring love
47:47 - and those are the people that are more
47:48 - than welcome here
47:50 - cloud functions with firebase i mean you
47:52 - can actually do this
47:53 - from front end and this essentially
47:55 - allows you to be able to do
47:57 - all the backend functionality you could
47:59 - ever dream of
48:01 - cloud functions allow you to do that and
48:02 - they allow you to do it kind of from the
48:04 - front end so
48:05 - that's a really beautiful thing anything
48:08 - else you want to touch base on with this
48:09 - before we move forward
48:11 - um just really powerful basically if you
48:12 - ever need some back-end functionality
48:14 - guys
48:14 - don't go ahead and start up an express
48:16 - server or something like that
48:17 - your your answer would be in cloud
48:19 - functions in case anyone was wondering
48:21 - that so definitely go ahead
48:22 - and learn those if you're interested in
48:23 - doing some kind of back end with your
48:25 - front end
48:25 - yup uh here is an amazing
48:28 - uh comment from the good gamer
48:32 - and he says i got a job as a developer
48:36 - thanks qazi i've not done any tutorials
48:38 - but i followed your other videos and
48:40 - django course
48:41 - damn amazing nice that is amazing man
48:45 - pumped to hear that well done so
48:48 - let's go here now now storage
48:51 - firebase also allows you to do all the
48:53 - storage so when you're storing
48:55 - media when you want your media to be
48:58 - optimized and served in the fastest way
49:01 - possible firebase handles that when you
49:04 - want to have a database
49:05 - and you want to store things videos
49:07 - anything like that firebase can handle
49:09 - that for you as well
49:10 - yeah exactly they do google on it they
49:13 - do a bunch of analytics and test lab
49:15 - stuff so analytics
49:17 - keeping track of your users who's doing
49:18 - what on your on your platform is
49:20 - massively useful and insightful
49:21 - especially as your business grows
49:23 - firebase test lab guys if you build an
49:25 - app firebase test lab literally will
49:28 - check that app across so many different
49:31 - physical devices
49:32 - and it will show you screenshots of how
49:34 - the app looks on every single one of
49:36 - those devices
49:37 - automatically which is insane like
49:39 - that's really really insane
49:40 - really powerful especially when you're
49:41 - sort of you want your app to work on
49:43 - everyone's device
49:44 - and be universal so really really
49:46 - powerful stuff
49:47 - super powerful henrik says do you have a
49:50 - tutorial using firebase almost every
49:53 - single
49:53 - one of our clones that we built on our
49:55 - youtube channel over the last few weeks
49:57 - you guys can go and watch them tick tock
49:59 - instagram
50:00 - um facebook messenger clone tinder clone
50:03 - netflix clone all of them pretty much
50:05 - are using firebase
50:06 - so you can watch them they're amazing
50:08 - tutorials on how to use firebase
50:10 - yep exactly it allows you to grow your
50:12 - business it allows you a b
50:14 - testing cloud messaging in-app messaging
50:16 - all that good stuff comes with firebase
50:19 - built in now what's the best part about
50:22 - firebase do you guys want to know
50:25 - exactly well let's go for it and what is
50:27 - that sonny
50:28 - guys it's free it's fast and it's easy
50:31 - to use
50:32 - free to a limit guys so all the use
50:34 - cases which you guys are probably going
50:35 - to be using it for
50:36 - completely free so you guys can go ahead
50:38 - even deploying your apps guys
50:40 - it will give you a really beautiful
50:42 - little url which is actually completely
50:44 - fine to keep that url
50:45 - as your primary url and you can pretty
50:47 - much host it forever for free
50:49 - so definitely and it's the easiest
50:51 - hosting solution i've ever seen
50:53 - when it comes to a web app so definitely
50:54 - worth going ahead and doing that
50:56 - agreed now let's move on into which code
50:59 - editor should i
51:00 - use because we've talked about firebase
51:03 - and i think firebase is phenomenal and
51:05 - hopefully you guys love that too
51:06 - but i think one thing a lot of people
51:08 - want to know is what code editor should
51:10 - i use so here we got
51:12 - you know that code editor war should i
51:14 - use webstorm should i use visual studio
51:16 - code sublime or adam
51:18 - what do you recommend sunny so i was
51:20 - actually i've kind of gone through a
51:22 - bunch of these i use sublime at one
51:23 - point i use atom
51:25 - but now my by far guys just for the
51:27 - simplicity of
51:28 - how you add on extensions and sort of
51:30 - the the growth of it
51:32 - uh vs code guys vs code is so powerful
51:34 - it's ridiculous like i would really
51:36 - really recommend and we're going to run
51:37 - through some of the stuff
51:38 - as to some of the reasons as to why
51:41 - we're firm believers that it's
51:42 - definitely the best code
51:44 - for you guys yep and here now we're
51:46 - going to jump into also the extensions
51:48 - that are actually the most powerful for
51:50 - vs code
51:51 - i think one extension alone makes it
51:54 - that you can't go and look anywhere else
51:56 - the one extension that comes to my mind
51:58 - is called live share
51:59 - this alone makes me feel like you can
52:01 - never use anything like adam is just
52:03 - like
52:03 - it seems like it's from 1930s now uh
52:06 - yeah so does
52:07 - every other editor that i could dream of
52:09 - the live share
52:10 - means sunny and i can code remotely he's
52:13 - in london i'm in us
52:14 - on the same freaking code editor and it
52:17 - feels like your local host it's not
52:19 - screen share
52:20 - it's not team viewer it's literally the
52:22 - same exact thing so he's seeing it in
52:24 - perfect resolution
52:26 - he has access to my command line my
52:28 - localhost 3000
52:30 - and even when my browser localhost 3000
52:32 - is up he can actually view the website
52:34 - and everything
52:35 - exactly guys it's so powerful and just
52:38 - for that one extension alone
52:39 - it's worth downloading and just giving
52:41 - it a try so really really powerful stuff
52:43 - we've got a few others which are not
52:45 - worth mentioning we've got prettier so a
52:47 - lot of us hate doing that indentation
52:49 - we hate adding spaces how many stuff is
52:51 - very opinionated
52:52 - so like we just want it so when you hit
52:54 - save it just formats all your code and
52:55 - keeps it concise
52:56 - pretty it does that for you really
52:58 - really handy stuff
53:00 - um any others worth mentioning here qazi
53:02 - the other ones that i think are worth
53:03 - mentioning here
53:04 - i like brackets a lot so in javascript
53:07 - and react and all this one thing that
53:09 - was annoying to me as a python user is
53:11 - like
53:11 - oh my god so many freaking squiggly
53:14 - brackets
53:15 - and parentheses and it's insane
53:19 - and then semicolons and you miss one of
53:21 - those and your code just doesn't work
53:22 - and it's hard to see it's hard to
53:24 - visualize
53:25 - so what this does is it gives you
53:28 - matching brackets so you guys see how
53:29 - this red one over here closes this red
53:31 - one right over there
53:32 - right and then the yellow one closes the
53:34 - yellow one so each bracket having its
53:36 - own color
53:37 - is very very useful because you know
53:40 - where easily it opens where it closes
53:41 - and you never will have that problem
53:43 - again
53:44 - another extension that's important to
53:46 - mention is
53:48 - this snippets one where for react it's
53:51 - super important where you can just do
53:52 - rfce and boom it just makes a component
53:55 - for you
53:55 - i think that's pretty damn handy but in
53:58 - terms of the usefulness of it like i
54:00 - think
54:01 - you know all of these are pretty
54:02 - important the ones we use the most is
54:04 - prettier
54:06 - i think another one that gets used a lot
54:07 - if you're doing remote programming is
54:09 - live
54:10 - share and then i would say uh the
54:12 - snippets and then the brackets
54:14 - yeah exactly so on the next side we
54:17 - touch base on pretty much what we spoke
54:18 - about the lentis and formats that you
54:20 - need
54:21 - are prettier eslint and es7 snippets in
54:24 - my opinion they are really really
54:25 - something which is going to dial you in
54:27 - and make you much faster of what you do
54:29 - also one that we haven't put on here
54:31 - guys i think it's built into vs code by
54:32 - default it's called emit
54:34 - emit is really powerful guys it's how we
54:36 - you'll see when i'm coding sometimes
54:37 - i'll just write div
54:39 - dot and then i'll have some stuff on
54:40 - there and it's very very powerful in
54:42 - in order to write html very fast so
54:44 - definitely worth checking out
54:46 - cool so these are your linters right
54:48 - eslant
54:49 - prettier and es7 snippets so you guys
54:52 - can use these
54:53 - these are good for linting and
54:54 - formatting and what that means is some
54:56 - of them will check your code
54:58 - so i think prettier will format your
55:00 - code and make it look pretty
55:02 - lint will tell you like you know this
55:05 - looks
55:06 - wrong uh you're using the wrong type of
55:08 - pattern here
55:09 - or like it'll like highlight hey you
55:11 - shouldn't use this many characters in
55:12 - one line things like that right sonny
55:15 - yeah do you know where the lin came from
55:17 - the name i didn't know this until like
55:18 - literally about a week ago you know
55:20 - those linters that you put on your
55:21 - clothing
55:23 - oh i didn't know that yeah so it's
55:25 - like picking up the
55:26 - the the fluff of your code that's why
55:28 - it's called yes lint
55:29 - do you know where it's debugging do you
55:30 - know where debugging came from
55:32 - yeah they found a fly right in the
55:34 - massive in one of the first computers
55:36 - or something yeah they would get flies
55:38 - or cockroaches and things like that in
55:40 - the
55:40 - physical computer so they would debug by
55:43 - taking them out
55:44 - they would take out the bugs from the
55:45 - computer i love that
55:48 - i don't know i think frankie or somebody
55:50 - told me that
55:51 - yeah vs code live share important
55:54 - extension
55:55 - pair programming this is how sunny and i
55:57 - usually program
56:02 - exactly the blonde one is me especially
56:04 - when it comes to react
56:10 - that's so funny all right guys
56:13 - how do you but like with all this said
56:15 - like how do you go ahead and learn like
56:18 - how do you
56:18 - what's our advice to you guys if you're
56:20 - new to this journey like how do you go
56:22 - ahead and learn
56:23 - um so we've got a few things on the
56:24 - slides coming up so we've got
56:26 - uh we've got youtube so we've got
56:28 - youtube and
56:29 - from youtube we're talking about our
56:31 - tutorials completely free guys you can
56:33 - go ahead and check them out
56:34 - we've also got um we also recommend that
56:36 - you go ahead
56:37 - and join a community guys so whether it
56:40 - be facebook whether it be linkedin
56:41 - whether you're recording your journey on
56:43 - instagram
56:44 - or whether it be discord or even slack
56:46 - so like uh we actually have our internal
56:48 - slack community which we go ahead and
56:50 - recommend
56:50 - definitely something worth checking out
56:53 - what's your thoughts on that
56:54 - yeah i think this community is super
56:55 - important you know this is why in profit
56:57 - with javascript we just developed a
56:59 - curated community of people
57:01 - you know uh profitable javascript is our
57:03 - paid coaching uh
57:04 - paid program for javascript where we
57:06 - teach you these skills
57:07 - but really the community like you kind
57:09 - of come for the course but you stay for
57:11 - the people you know you stay for the
57:12 - community
57:14 - and so we've got over 1300 members and
57:16 - they're just so
57:17 - freaking amazing and dialed in but guys
57:20 - it doesn't matter whether you join our
57:21 - community or somebody else's just make
57:23 - sure you're part of some community
57:25 - i think it's important it helps you keep
57:27 - moving forward
57:28 - and it keeps you accountable and yeah
57:30 - the people matter
57:32 - yeah so join a community and um should
57:35 - we talk about profit with javascript
57:37 - right now or i think we can talk about a
57:38 - little bit later
57:39 - yeah we took my eye after yeah okay so
57:41 - guys something
57:42 - yeah go for it so what is tutorial hell
57:46 - sonny you can talk about this actually
57:48 - yeah so guys what we find is like a lot
57:50 - of people what they do is they tend to
57:52 - sort of follow tutorials that they see
57:53 - whether it be on youtube or
57:55 - like a stack overflow tutorial and then
57:57 - what they'll do is they'll copy it line
57:59 - by line
58:00 - and what you'll end up with is like
58:02 - you'll finish 10 projects for example
58:04 - but you basically like you haven't
58:06 - really learned anything you just have 10
58:07 - cool projects that you can show
58:09 - but if i was to go in and change
58:10 - something or break something you
58:12 - wouldn't be able to tell me like
58:13 - how to fix it or something like that and
58:14 - then we call that tutorial hub because
58:16 - if you feel like
58:17 - you're doing all these tutorials but
58:18 - you're just not learning anything right
58:20 - so
58:20 - my best advice in this case is don't uh
58:23 - whenever you do that
58:24 - either one extend onto what you've built
58:26 - so if you build a youtube clone
58:27 - add some functionality to the youtube
58:29 - clone so that it then goes
58:30 - further than what was taught inside of
58:32 - that uh any any other tips on how to get
58:34 - out of tutorial
58:35 - i think just build real projects you
58:37 - guys like dribble
58:39 - built for like for example if you're
58:40 - front end developer look at what's on
58:42 - dribble build that
58:43 - uh look at what inspires you build it um
58:46 - don't get stuck in tutorial help move on
58:48 - and actually start doing useful stuff
58:50 - with what you learned
58:51 - now when it comes to fundamentals master
58:55 - them
58:55 - okay yeah master them guys and the
58:58 - reason why we added this slide is
58:59 - because
59:00 - it really is a it's a huge step and it's
59:02 - going to be the difference between you
59:04 - moving very fast and you're moving
59:05 - extremely slow like
59:07 - go ahead break down the fundamentals and
59:09 - use things like w3 schools w3 schools is
59:12 - amazing
59:13 - i love this by the way i just wanted to
59:15 - throw this in here epic epic zeus says
59:17 - you guys are like assassin's creed
59:19 - forming a brotherhood of next-gen
59:21 - programmers we work in the dark to serve
59:23 - the light
59:24 - hey love that nice
59:27 - awesome coin by epic that's a cool name
59:30 - as well it exists
59:31 - yeah that is a pretty dope name yeah
59:34 - nice okay so yeah guys mastering the
59:37 - fundamentals and what is one of those
59:39 -  i love this game that is the
59:42 - funniest thing i've ever seen
59:44 - oh my god so
59:47 - one of the fundamentals guys is get
59:50 - and github and you guys have to learn
59:52 - that and for those of you who know about
59:54 - git merge
59:55 - nobody ever wants to see it happen it's
59:57 - not fun yeah
59:58 - but you got to learn it i think it is
60:00 - very very important a lot of people are
60:02 - saying lag but i think we're going to
60:03 - keep going until it just
60:04 - ends yeah i think it's i think it's
60:06 - cleared up now yeah we're good yep
60:08 - so why you need need to know git and
60:11 - github why is this important sonny
60:12 - i don't care about it i don't need to
60:14 - know about it right you know i can just
60:15 - become a developer without it
60:17 - that's what i for dude but every single
60:20 - professional job that you go in
60:21 - any team environment where you've got
60:23 - more than one developer
60:25 - they don't work together by sharing the
60:26 - files right they work together with git
60:28 - right you need to know get if you're
60:30 - going to be a professional web developer
60:31 - whether it be
60:32 - uh freelancing and you're jumping into a
60:34 - team of a team of
60:36 - sort of developers or you're going into
60:37 - a permanent position you need to know
60:39 - gear and you because what happens is
60:40 - they store their code
60:42 - on something called a repository and
60:44 - then basically you need to learn how to
60:45 - push code to that repository
60:47 - pull code from so if another developer's
60:49 - done some work you can pull that in
60:50 - all of those things are covered with git
60:52 - right now the most popular platform that
60:54 - users get is github you've also got git
60:56 - labs and a few others
60:57 - but i really recommend getting familiar
60:59 - with github it's the most popular
61:00 - it's owned by microsoft now and it's
61:02 - here to stay so it's definitely getting
61:04 - more powerful
61:04 - definitely worth investing your time in
61:06 - that yeah and remember guys one thing i
61:08 - think that's confusing git
61:10 - is not github yeah
61:13 - a lot of people get that uh confusion
61:16 - github is like dropbox for code
61:18 - github is like google drive for code
61:22 - that's github is just like a place where
61:23 - you put your code that's it so
61:25 - git hub is not that important to learn
61:27 - like it doesn't matter if you use github
61:29 - or if you use bitbucket that's not that
61:31 - git you must learn git
61:34 - this is version control this is the time
61:36 - machine for your code if you mess
61:38 - something up you can go back in time
61:39 - so exactly pretty good time machine yeah
61:42 - it's like
61:42 - and also guys it can be scary i know
61:44 - when you're trying to learn github with
61:46 - the terminal
61:46 - so if you guys are experiencing that
61:48 - sort of fear or you're like oh i don't
61:49 - want to touch anything because i'm
61:50 - freaking out and i'm going to break
61:52 - something then something i recommend is
61:53 - something called get kraken
61:55 - which is actually a really nice
61:57 - interface for gear
61:58 - and you can pretty much drag and drop
62:00 - your branches and do all your stuff very
62:02 - visually
62:02 - so if you are afraid of it go ahead and
62:04 - check out get cracking really handy uh
62:06 - gui for uh for handling get yeah yeah
62:10 - i think that's important i'm sometimes
62:12 - mentioned that too
62:13 - so awesome so let's go back uh
62:16 - yeah henrik when he watched that part
62:18 - but git is not github he
62:20 - asked earlier like what's the difference
62:22 - between them and then he's like oh
62:23 - that's yup that's for me
62:25 - so guys just to kind of recap you know
62:28 - we touched on a lot of things and we
62:30 - still have a bunch of things to go but
62:31 - we talked about frameworks right
62:33 - and why react is the framework that you
62:35 - should actually pick
62:37 - uh we're going to talk we talked about
62:39 - that html and javascript is what you
62:41 - need to know
62:42 - to become a developer you know front-end
62:43 - developer and we've touched on
62:46 - other things like you know which code
62:49 - editor you should use
62:50 - but we still have some other things
62:51 - we're gonna touch on moving forward okay
62:53 - so just stay
62:54 - buckled in we're gonna keep going and if
62:56 - you're here and you're enjoying this
62:57 - make sure to like
62:58 - the video so it goes out to other people
63:01 - please it helps us
63:02 - definitely please do that all right
63:06 - cool now what is a pre processor
63:09 - now all right go ahead go for it yeah so
63:12 - a pre-processor guys is pretty much
63:15 - it's it applies to css so we talked
63:17 - about the three fundamentals html css
63:19 - javascript but we're talking about
63:20 - pre-processors
63:21 - all about css right and what it does
63:24 - basically is it's kind of like think of
63:26 - it simply as an
63:27 - upgrade to your css right so with sas
63:30 - they introduced um so on the next side
63:32 - we've got three really
63:33 - uh really popular ones we've got sas
63:35 - post css and less
63:36 - right they're quite opinionated you can
63:38 - use whatever one you prefer
63:40 - sas was quite a popular one that i saw
63:43 - and it basically introduced something
63:44 - called uh
63:45 - like variables into your into your css
63:48 - which was really really powerful guys
63:50 - and it also allowed you to do nesting
63:51 - and a bunch of other stuff so it
63:52 - basically made it more maintainable
63:54 - to go ahead and use um css i think post
63:57 - css and css modules
63:59 - also prevents one of those common
64:01 - problems that we run into where for
64:03 - example in react you you developing
64:05 - components right
64:06 - so if you have two different files and
64:08 - you have the same class name in each of
64:09 - those files
64:10 - you can have like overriding rules
64:12 - without realizing by using these
64:14 - libraries
64:14 - it actually goes ahead and adds an
64:17 - additional class name to it so
64:19 - you never get that issue so even if you
64:21 - had the same class names it wouldn't
64:23 - actually clash
64:23 - so really important things here very
64:25 - subtle but very important if you want to
64:27 - become
64:27 - that next level developer yep
64:31 - awesome all right so let's move to the
64:34 - next one
64:34 - styled components so what are these
64:36 - sunny
64:37 - so this is in react we use start
64:39 - components i really i'm a big fan of
64:41 - style components
64:42 - i think we'll actually go ahead and
64:43 - include this in the next build um
64:45 - basically in react you have something
64:47 - called props and it's very difficult
64:49 - sometimes to have like
64:50 - how do you use your variables so like
64:52 - your javascript variables with css
64:54 - for example if you want to if you've got
64:57 - like a variable which is true or false
64:58 - how do you apply that with your css
65:00 - style components is your answer it
65:02 - allows you to very simply go ahead and
65:04 - do that
65:05 - and you can pretty much basically go
65:07 - ahead and use your props in a component
65:09 - and and and conditionally render your
65:11 - style based on those
65:12 - and those variables so really really
65:14 - powerful stuff
65:15 - uh yeah really really and it's here to
65:18 - stay
65:18 - guys a lot of big companies use it yeah
65:21 - beautiful we just got another super chat
65:23 - by d-punk thank you for that thank you
65:26 - really appreciate it we're
65:27 - over 21 in super chat so thank you guys
65:31 - all right now steve says much less
65:35 - useful now we have css variables
65:37 - natively
65:39 - really good point actually yeah so
65:40 - that's the reason why sas is being less
65:42 - used now i'm also going to talk about
65:44 - sas is being less used
65:47 - oh yeah yeah so like because we have css
65:50 - variables natively now it's actually not
65:52 - as needed as it used to be and it's
65:53 - quite
65:54 - there's quite a few issues with it but
65:55 - we're going to talk about a few things
65:56 - which actually helps you alleviate the
65:58 - the problems that you use you experience
66:00 - with sas so one of them is
66:02 - css modules which we spoke about if you
66:03 - have two files with the same
66:06 - class names this is going to help you
66:07 - avoid that problem and
66:09 - the next one is sas actually allowed you
66:12 - to do something called
66:13 - nesting right but the problem was that
66:15 - people used to nest like
66:17 - five levels deep they would have like um
66:19 - let's just say like
66:20 - card underscore title underscore text
66:23 - underscore
66:24 - like uh link or something like that and
66:25 - it just got super complicated so bem
66:27 - is a really good naming convention which
66:30 - i recommend
66:30 - everyone goes and learns we actually use
66:32 - this in all of our builds
66:34 - really really important stuff i i hated
66:36 - it when i started by the way guys i
66:38 - really didn't see the value in them
66:40 - so i'm somebody who got converted on
66:42 - this and i really do live by it now so
66:44 - something definitely worth learning and
66:46 - because he's a big fan of them now too
66:48 - oh yeah now i know about this
66:52 - now guys with pwa oftentimes we get that
66:55 - question like hey what's a pwa
66:57 - which actually was a question i had in
66:59 - the chat when we were coding
67:00 - and then steve answered but like this is
67:02 - progressive web apps
67:04 - so this is where you're coding in a way
67:06 - where literally like
67:07 - whatever you're building will
67:09 - essentially be turned into a mobile app
67:11 - as well for a phone and it's like
67:13 - native so that's a little bit about how
67:15 - progressive web apps
67:16 - work you want to add anything on this
67:18 - sony um i think on the next side we have
67:20 - a really nice breakdown
67:22 - so basically you're gonna you're coding
67:23 - like a web app but it's very very
67:25 - similar to your native app right so
67:27 - here's a bunch of features of a
67:29 - pwa so you have it's fully responsive
67:31 - and
67:32 - it has a very high browser compatibility
67:34 - right when you use
67:35 - uh create react app with react it is
67:38 - making a pwa just in case you're
67:40 - wondering
67:40 - uh it works offline so you can use
67:42 - something like service workers
67:44 - service workers make the app super fast
67:46 - and allow that offline sort of
67:48 - functionality which you get with a
67:49 - normal app it has like an app like
67:51 - interface so you can actually go ahead
67:52 - and
67:53 - click the more option on like an iphone
67:55 - for example and you can add it to your
67:56 - home screen
67:57 - and it actually gives you a native app
67:59 - fill so it goes onto your home screen
68:01 - and even removes the browser the bar at
68:03 - the top when you open it so it's like
68:04 - super
68:05 - clean you can also get push
68:07 - notifications which is really important
68:08 - but i don't know why and if apple will
68:11 - ever watch this video
68:12 - i don't know can you guys hurry up on
68:13 - that because android
68:15 - allowed push notifications on pwas for a
68:18 - very long time
68:19 - but apple was still on the fence with it
68:21 - so it's been a big discussion and
68:22 - they're really pushing for it
68:24 - but i really do want them to do that but
68:26 - you can get push notifications on a pwa
68:28 - yeah nice and you've already talked
68:31 - about that it's fast with service
68:32 - workers so these are the features of pwa
68:36 - awesome now you got a lot of type
68:39 - checkers like typescript and then you
68:41 - got
68:41 - flow there's typescript
68:44 - and oftentimes people are like what is
68:46 - typescript so what is typescript sunny
68:48 - so it's a superset of javascript so it
68:51 - basically sits on
68:52 - top so it's not like a different
68:53 - language or anything like that
68:55 - it's just like a layer on top of java
68:57 - javascript and basically if you came
68:58 - from a java background or any strongly
69:01 - typed language background
69:03 - then you'll know what types are right so
69:05 - javascript's a weekly type language
69:06 - which
69:07 - means that you don't have to say that a
69:09 - string is going to be a string you have
69:10 - to say that a number is going to be a
69:11 - number
69:12 - et cetera your number's going to be an
69:14 - integer but with typescript
69:15 - you now get that functionality and it
69:17 - also gives you a bunch of other things
69:18 - like inheritance
69:20 - and all these other things that you had
69:21 - in those strongly typed languages
69:23 - so it's basically like like the visual
69:24 - here it's like a super jacked up jack
69:28 - javascript nice i love that image
69:32 - alex goes thanks for the comment shout
69:33 - out clever programmer but i've been
69:35 - asking this and just got aired
69:37 - are you planning to make an eight hour
69:39 - long video for learning react.js
69:41 - yes we are it's gonna be probably 12
69:43 - hours long
69:44 - yeah and it's gonna have like a lot of
69:47 - amazing
69:48 - content in it so let's move forward with
69:50 - this this
69:51 - is typescript versus flow yeah
69:54 - so guys literally this is a big
69:56 - opinionated debate and i've actually got
69:58 - into
69:58 - huge debates in actual professional
70:00 - companies where we talk about
70:02 - are we going to use typescript are we
70:03 - going to use flow my opinion on this
70:05 - matter is
70:06 - use typescript because it's much more
70:09 - sort of picked up now it's much more in
70:11 - use it's much more robust and the power
70:13 - and it's actually supported by microsoft
70:16 - um i i believe so it's actually
70:18 - they're working as well but it's more of
70:20 - an official uh
70:22 - superset of javascript as opposed to i
70:23 - think that it has a new name now which i
70:26 - think you probably haven't heard about
70:28 - oh yeah yeah it's actually called
70:32 - hype script
70:38 - this is where we need the bell you know
70:42 - hey
70:46 - [Music]
70:49 - so yeah guys you know look into it all
70:52 - right
70:53 - we got dino so what's the hype all about
70:56 - all right so dino we always see comments
70:58 - flying in about dino and yes guys if
71:00 - you're interested in about you know we
71:01 - can go ahead and make a video about it
71:03 - it's basically a runtime environment so
71:05 - just like you have node.js right which
71:07 - runs on the servers
71:08 - dino also runs on servers and it's
71:10 - pretty much a case of it's like a
71:12 - it's like a more modern version of
71:14 - node.js so out of the box
71:17 - um it supports typescript whereas
71:19 - node.js you have to install a bunch of
71:21 - things to get typescript so that's an
71:22 - example of the difference
71:24 - it also comes with a bunch of uh it's
71:26 - built in rust i believe so it's very
71:28 - optimal it's very fast
71:29 - uh i think it may pick up but it's very
71:32 - it's very early
71:32 - in in that journey so definitely
71:34 - something which i mean is it's one of
71:36 - those cool things if you're interested
71:37 - in this and you're you're what
71:38 - you're enjoying the video sure go check
71:40 - out dino we can make a video on that
71:42 - awesome all right so now let's get into
71:46 - there's stuff going on here with webpack
71:48 - so webpack is pretty important to learn
71:50 - why is this important
71:51 - why should we care so yeah so when
71:53 - you're learning uh like
71:55 - especially when you're trying to build
71:56 - progressive web apps i recommend you
71:58 - kind of
71:59 - start with create react apps you don't
72:00 - have to jump in with and
72:02 - learn web packs because they basically
72:04 - get rid of that headache for you
72:05 - but when you go into a professional
72:07 - environment and you're doing any sort of
72:08 - javascript
72:09 - i can be sure like you can be sure that
72:11 - they're going to actually be handling
72:12 - the build
72:13 - process with webpack by itself or
72:15 - something like rollup.js which is a
72:18 - different one
72:18 - but basically what this does guys is it
72:20 - bundles your app so all the files all
72:22 - the css all of those things into one
72:24 - bundle which is then served
72:26 - and that's what the user sees as and
72:28 - then go right so definitely something
72:30 - which is quite important
72:31 - and you should go ahead and learn yep
72:33 - definitely dev tools guys master
72:36 - chrome dev tools you can do so much with
72:38 - this thing
72:39 - this is probably one of the most
72:40 - important things i mean i don't even
72:41 - know how you can develop apps or develop
72:43 - web stuff without doing this because
72:45 - that's the number one
72:47 - ask for learning but this is pretty much
72:49 - that thing you do when you go on chrome
72:50 - and you right click and inspect
72:52 - right the thing that pops up that allows
72:53 - you to do everything so like if i was
72:55 - just to demo it for anybody that doesn't
72:57 - know about this
72:58 - like literally if you go on youtube
73:00 - right now you should know how to use
73:02 - things like
73:03 - death tools at a very basic level at
73:06 - least
73:06 - and then you can master but you should
73:08 - master them so
73:10 - you know for people who have never like
73:13 - looked into it let's wait for this to
73:16 - pop up
73:20 - there oh damn our freaking video is the
73:22 - first recommendation let's go
73:26 - nice so nice so now guys over here
73:30 - we got logan paul he's thinking about
73:32 - youtube we have grant cardone
73:35 - talking about how to close over the
73:36 - phone but i can actually hit inspect
73:39 - yeah and then i can even choose this
73:42 - and i can go ahead and literally change
73:46 - the name of this thing over here or find
73:49 - out
73:49 - how youtube is using you know how is
73:52 - youtube
73:53 - formatting this how are they using html
73:55 - and css
73:57 - and i can then use that to reverse
73:58 - engineer this into kind of my own app
74:00 - and you guys can go ahead and change
74:02 - like some of the copy that's on here so
74:09 - this is something uh i this is something
74:11 - i actually do pretty regularly because
74:13 - i want to put my video here and check
74:15 - what it actually looks like
74:16 - so we can actually say you know we're
74:19 - going to be
74:19 - dropping our twitter clone project
74:22 - tomorrow
74:24 - with the react js
74:27 - and you can see boom it just popped that
74:29 - in so this is just a basic basic example
74:32 - of this
74:32 - i'm sure most of you probably know how
74:34 - to use it more than this
74:36 - and it's one gonna be one of your most
74:39 - important tools to use so
74:40 - dev tools and chrome 100 learn that yeah
74:44 - and also guys we like if you're
74:45 - debugging console logging everything out
74:47 - is a really good way of debugging so
74:49 - you definitely need to use uh dev tools
74:51 - when you're console logging
74:53 - yep 100 so let's go to next one what is
74:56 - this
74:57 - this is the react profiler so when
74:59 - you're coding with react
75:01 - it's all about once you get to a certain
75:03 - level it's about making your react app
75:04 - optimal
75:05 - so that you know that it's only
75:06 - re-rendering what it needs to re-render
75:08 - the react profiler is just you access it
75:11 - in the same way that kazi showed you how
75:13 - you access the inspector
75:14 - but you need to install that i believe
75:16 - on the the chrome extensions
75:18 - but basically guys that's basically it's
75:20 - a very very good way of checking what's
75:22 - rendering inside your react
75:24 - app and how many times it's re-rendering
75:26 - it also allows you to manipulate the
75:27 - state and the props
75:29 - so you can actually go in their head and
75:30 - you go you can go and check out and you
75:32 - can change the state and properly when
75:33 - you're
75:34 - sort of building out an app it can
75:35 - really help you out and assets just
75:37 - wrote a good comment
75:38 - he says stick with node for now dino's
75:40 - community is not that big
75:41 - big as it is very new and that's a very
75:43 - good point you guys
75:44 - for now before you jump on the hype
75:46 - train of dino
75:48 - stick with node kind of learn dino for
75:51 - like hobby projects you know do stuff on
75:53 - the side so you're just aware of it
75:54 - but npm isn't gonna go anywhere it's
75:57 - gonna be there for
75:58 - pretty much for a really long time and
76:00 - if dino really starts to take off
76:02 - then siri more seriously start looking
76:04 - into it but
76:06 - you know i do say that the hype train
76:08 - matters if you catch trends that helps
76:10 - put you ahead of people so
76:12 - you know i think it's not a bad idea
76:15 - just even as a hobby play around with it
76:17 - and kind of get to know it
76:18 - yeah definitely and guys it's just going
76:20 - to make you a better front-end developer
76:22 - when you when you mess around with these
76:23 - tools and then you sort of get more and
76:24 - more used to all of these things
76:26 - um so nothing no harm with going ahead
76:28 - and learning it 100
76:30 - now native apps and react native what is
76:35 - this
76:36 - yeah so guys if you code in react just
76:38 - know that you're going to get the
76:40 - benefit
76:41 - of actually then transferring pretty
76:43 - much like 90 percent of that knowledge
76:45 - to something called react native and the
76:47 - react native allows you to build native
76:49 - ios and android apps so really really
76:53 - powerful
76:53 - to to be able to do that and i've
76:55 - actually first hand done this
76:56 - and you can get full full native apps
76:59 - with the same react code base pretty
77:01 - much
77:01 - so really really powerful beautiful
77:04 - and electron allows you to make desktop
77:07 - apps so this is
77:08 - uh electron js right that's the library
77:11 - yeah i think slack is actually built
77:13 - with electrons i think
77:14 - slack is built with electron and
77:16 - yesterday i discovered something else
77:18 - pretty huge was built with electron
77:20 - somebody messaged me on instagram saying
77:22 - some
77:23 - garbage uh zacky actually he usually
77:26 - says really great things but he sent a
77:28 - message saying something funny
77:30 - and then i responded to him let me see
77:32 - if i can actually pull up his message
77:33 - because that was pretty
77:37 - um insightful i mean you can talk about
77:39 - this for a second while i look for it
77:41 - yeah so guys really really uh useful
77:43 - stuff here like
77:44 - the fact is like if you know what slack
77:47 - is you know how popular and you know how
77:48 - much that's taken off
77:50 - it just shows you that yes you can also
77:52 - make you can make money from
77:53 - like mobile apps and web apps but guys
77:55 - remember their desktop apps started the
77:57 - whole thing off right like
77:59 - having like microsoft word having those
78:01 - things actually started at the whole
78:02 - i got it zacky zaki sent me a message on
78:06 - instagram and he said no offense but
78:08 - electron gs is crap
78:10 - with normal windows development you just
78:12 - need to learn c sharp with some xml
78:14 - you know some c c sharp with some xml in
78:17 - your set
78:18 - so that's it pretty easy huh and then he
78:20 - goes personally i'd rather learn that
78:22 - instead of electron but js is
78:26 - definitely powerful with no cap
78:29 - and i responded to him and i said visual
78:33 - studio code
78:34 - is built with electron js and also
78:38 - slack is built with electron js so i'm
78:40 - like i'd ease up on calling that crap
78:43 - yeah the visual studio code is what
78:46 - you're going to be using to code that c
78:48 - sharp that you were talking about yeah
78:50 - yeah yeah yeah
78:53 - yeah so you know just that's what it is
78:56 - like it's a valuable thing
78:57 - learn it i think it's it can be helpful
78:59 - if you want to make desktop apps
79:00 - now let's talk about testing frameworks
79:03 - so
79:03 - testing so let's talk about unit versus
79:06 - integration versus for
79:07 - functional testing so so three different
79:10 - types guys
79:11 - we've got an example here called of just
79:14 - called and basically that's an example
79:15 - of unit unit testing is when we test
79:17 - one specific area of an app right or
79:20 - like a website
79:21 - so it's a very specific thing right
79:23 - integration is when we integrate two
79:25 - different areas of an app and we test it
79:27 - together
79:27 - so like does this screen work with this
79:29 - screen or does this sort of
79:30 - functionality with this one crossing
79:31 - over with this one work together
79:33 - and then functional is like as a user if
79:36 - i do a login and i go through the entire
79:38 - journey
79:38 - is it everything working so you see like
79:40 - there's a big difference between the
79:41 - three
79:42 - just is a very very common um
79:45 - unit testing framework which is used and
79:47 - they usually combine it with something
79:48 - called
79:49 - enzyme so on the next side we have
79:51 - enzyme and here we have uh it's
79:53 - basically
79:54 - very very popular i'm sorry i just want
79:57 - to
79:57 - interrupt you for a second elizabeth
79:59 - who's also
80:00 - you know future code and she said and
80:03 - she
80:04 - was supposed to have a few interviews
80:05 - this week i think she's actually in la
80:07 - right now
80:08 - and she said she was having a few
80:10 - interviews and she said right now i had
80:11 - a major interview
80:13 - for a qa test engineer position
80:16 - while demoing my projects i casually
80:19 - left my deployed netflix app
80:21 - up in the browser and dropped it in they
80:24 - asked me to come back for the next round
80:27 - oh that's nice that's awesome especially
80:31 - if you're doing qa guys they're going to
80:32 - look at that and be like whoa this guy
80:34 - this person can like code this stuff oh
80:35 - wow we just got a five dollar donation
80:37 - oh thank you guys thank you so much
80:40 - and uh at one modus says hey kazi you
80:43 - help me to go from zero coding knowledge
80:45 - to qa automation tester way back in
80:47 - chicago five years ago
80:49 - oh nice oh that is amazing
80:53 - um dude can you drop your name in the
80:57 - chat
80:57 - because i think like i personally worked
80:59 - with you in person five years ago
81:01 - like literally i used to work with him
81:03 - in panera bread
81:04 - on teaching him coding so that would be
81:07 - awesome if you did that
81:08 - yeah i think so nice
81:11 - um before we started clever programmer
81:14 - but what
81:14 - future code was saying earlier was like
81:17 - the netflix clone that we actually built
81:18 - a few days ago and she had that open on
81:20 - the interview so you guys
81:21 - this stuff is powerful this can actually
81:23 - help you land jobs
81:25 - and then she went ahead and future code
81:27 - said i know my updated portfolio
81:29 - thanks to clever programmers getting
81:31 - recognized by companies for sure thanks
81:33 - guys
81:34 - awesome love that yep that makes us
81:37 - super super happy
81:39 - all right so we got just out of the way
81:42 - now what's up with
81:43 - what is this so enzyme so just as a unit
81:46 - testing framework that is
81:48 - most uh most of the time in react we
81:49 - combine it with enzymes so enzymes are
81:51 - testing utility for react
81:53 - and it basically allows you to test the
81:55 - user interface very easily so like if i
81:57 - click this button
81:58 - is the expected uh change on the page
82:01 - gonna happen or not
82:02 - right and it allows you to test all of
82:04 - that extremely fast
82:05 - and what people tend to do is something
82:07 - called test driven development where
82:08 - they'll write these tests using enzyme
82:10 - ingest first
82:11 - and then they would basically build the
82:13 - functionality until the test passes
82:16 - so something to definitely take he
82:19 - dropped it in and he said yes it's
82:20 - modesto from panera
82:22 - yep
82:26 - man that is awesome thank you so much
82:28 - for the donation i really appreciate it
82:30 - and that is
82:31 - amazing that was before any clever
82:33 - programmer any of that
82:35 - that was a great time so i appreciate
82:37 - you
82:38 - for sticking around and even now like
82:40 - helping out
82:42 - that's insane dude that's amazing nice
82:47 - go ahead yeah so we talked about enzyme
82:50 - enzymes a really popular one
82:52 - but what the problem was is that when
82:53 - sort of reactor really quickly evolved
82:55 - so we started seeing hooks and those
82:57 - sort of things
82:57 - uh enzyme quickly kind of got pushed to
82:59 - the side and react testing library is
83:01 - now part of create react
83:02 - app by default so this is a testing
83:04 - library and it supports hooks it
83:06 - supports all of the latest features
83:08 - um and when you use create react app you
83:10 - notice me and kazi usually delete these
83:12 - files
83:13 - um but if we're gonna eventually we will
83:14 - teach you
83:16 - we'll teach you guys how to go ahead and
83:18 - we personally don't like to test
83:20 - a lot yeah we test for like
83:23 - testing ourselves in a professional
83:24 - environment i guess yeah we could go
83:26 - ahead and teach some testing at some
83:27 - point like in a professional environment
83:30 - you would have
83:31 - modesto and he would be helping out with
83:34 - testing you would actually have somebody
83:36 - who has a job as a qa
83:38 - engineer who's doing the testing and so
83:41 - that way you
83:42 - yeah but i mean i think it's still
83:44 - important to learn test driven
83:46 - development
83:46 - i used to do it actually but i think
83:48 - it's just i'm lazy and i avoid it
83:50 - yeah and honestly guys my take on that
83:52 - is if you know how to do
83:54 - testing well for example if you get an
83:57 - interview and they ask you to build
83:58 - something if you write some unit tests
84:00 - in that interview watch them go a bit
84:02 - crazy like that's my honest advice to
84:04 - you guys
84:04 - just write a couple of tests and they
84:06 - will they will look at you and they'll
84:07 - put you above
84:08 - everyone else you submitted just by
84:10 - writing a few unit tests so just a
84:11 - little top tip there
84:12 - that's important that's actually really
84:15 - important
84:16 - uh to know that so you guys get your
84:18 - testing right and then you can actually
84:20 - um
84:21 - you know i think everybody should be
84:23 - getting tested right now
84:24 - uh anyway but you know get your
84:28 - get this right and you'll probably get a
84:30 - job too
84:33 - so the next one guys is functional
84:35 - testing we spoke about unit we spoke
84:36 - about integration but functional is when
84:39 - like it's basically mimicking what a
84:41 - user would do inside your app so
84:43 - an amazing one that i really recommend
84:45 - you guys go ahead and play with is
84:46 - something called cyprus to io
84:48 - and basically like if you want to log in
84:50 - the entire login journey
84:52 - see if everything's working you can
84:53 - pretty much record the journey and
84:55 - literally do it as you would do it
84:56 - and then it will programmatically write
84:58 - the code for you which is amazing
85:00 - uh and then you just click run and it'll
85:02 - basically run through your entire app
85:04 - super fast
85:04 - and you can do this in a really like a
85:06 - productive way and you can have this
85:08 - running in the background
85:09 - when every time you push your code
85:11 - something definitely worth looking into
85:12 - you now you guys might have heard of
85:13 - something called selenium
85:15 - selenium is uh modesto got a job
85:19 - doing selenium oh nice nice
85:22 - but yeah so like selenium was the most
85:24 - popular automation testing um
85:26 - framework for a very long time but it
85:29 - was quite clunky and then the guys
85:31 - over at site who who made cyprus style
85:33 - saw that it was clunky and soils
85:35 - outdated so they went ahead and built
85:37 - cyprus and cyprus
85:38 - i think it's only for chrome but it
85:39 - works so fast compared to selenium so
85:42 - guys like i really would recommend you
85:44 - just play with cyprus if you haven't
85:45 - ever tried that before and it's really
85:46 - easy
85:48 - yeah so yeah trice i burst you guys
85:51 - and um just want to say that we broke 18
85:54 - 000
85:54 - views so far nice uh so thank you guys
85:57 - so much for that we're only an hour and
85:59 - 25 minutes into it
86:00 - we're uh yeah we still got a lot more
86:04 - value bombs
86:05 - coming for you guys but just to recap
86:07 - you guys we've talked about a lot of
86:09 - things
86:10 - we've talked about sas we've talked
86:12 - about react being the framework that you
86:14 - should choose
86:15 - we've talked about learning javascript
86:17 - we've talked about learning firebase and
86:20 - how
86:20 - that will be your front-end your
86:23 - back-end
86:24 - your hosting cloud messaging like all of
86:27 - those things
86:28 - all-in-one database we have talked about
86:31 - even now we're talking about uh we
86:34 - talked about coding editors which coding
86:36 - editors best so visual studio code was
86:38 - our recommendation
86:39 - and right now we're talking about you
86:40 - know what testing frameworks you should
86:42 - use
86:43 - and between cypress and selenium and all
86:46 - these ones
86:46 - we recommend use cypress so there's a
86:48 - lot that we've covered but there's still
86:50 - a lot more that we're going to be
86:51 - covering so keep taking notes have a
86:53 - legal pad next to you
86:54 - because this is one of those videos that
86:55 - can really if you watch it and you
86:57 - follow
86:58 - everything that's laid out in here you
87:00 - can very realistically have
87:01 - a job plan three six-month 12-month plan
87:05 - like a solid plan that can actually land
87:07 - you a job
87:08 - exactly we also covered just to add on
87:11 - to that list we actually covered the
87:12 - five
87:13 - key concepts for uh as a visual like a
87:16 - visual design
87:18 - yeah so really important stuff and guys
87:20 - oh one thing i want to say is i don't
87:22 - know i think yesterday might have been
87:24 - the biggest day of our subscribers i
87:26 - kind of just want to check real quick
87:28 - but we're hitting a lot of craziest
87:31 - number of subscribers thanks to you guys
87:33 - because you guys are coming in for the
87:35 - live streams and
87:36 - oh my god like look at this this is
87:37 - actually the biggest day we have
87:39 - ever had what so look at
87:44 - yeah so look at this this is our
87:45 - subscribers column and if you guys take
87:47 - a look at this
87:48 - you guys are helping us fly and we were
87:50 - hitting 1000
87:51 - and then after you guys started jumping
87:53 - in two thousand three thousand four
87:55 - thousand yesterday was the biggest day
87:57 - we had in a
87:58 - really long time and that was 5 000 so

89:07 - that tomorrow will be a lot of fun
89:09 - and it'll be your chance if you haven't
89:10 - already to do your first build or add to
89:13 - your portfolio if you've been following
89:14 - us
89:15 - yep so what's up with the server side
89:17 - rendering
89:18 - yeah so this is a hot topic uh when it
89:20 - comes to sort of front-end development
89:22 - so
89:23 - server side rendering if you guys don't
89:24 - know what it is it's when
89:26 - most of the time when we sort of build a
89:28 - react app or any sort of app
89:30 - it's usually sort of we go on a web page
89:32 - we request the web
89:33 - page and then they basically send us all
89:35 - the files everything sort of loads the
89:36 - javascript loads on our browser right
89:39 - now that works pretty quick for the most
89:41 - part but what if you want the website to
89:42 - be
89:43 - super fast like if you wanted to
89:44 - basically as soon as you go on that
89:45 - website
89:46 - snap the things loaded so what happens
89:48 - is with server side rendering
89:49 - basically when you make that request
89:51 - when i go into for example google.com or
89:53 - something like that
89:54 - what's going to happen is we send that
89:56 - request google servers does all of the
89:58 - heavy lifting so it basically gets the
90:00 - entire web page
90:01 - bundled together right so it does the
90:03 - entire it bundles the entire webpage
90:05 - together
90:05 - and then it just serves the entire thing
90:07 - at once right so it basically does all
90:10 - the javascript calculations all that
90:11 - sort of
90:12 - uh that stuff which usually does take
90:14 - time on the page and what does this mean
90:16 - it means that the time to interaction is
90:19 - less so that's a crucial thing when
90:21 - you're a front-end developer
90:22 - how quick is the time to interact what i
90:25 - mean by that is when
90:26 - when you click on like say for example
90:28 - you go on facebook.com how quickly is it
90:30 - before you can start playing around with
90:31 - the page
90:33 - right yeah that's a crucial guys as a
90:35 - front-end developer you want that time
90:36 - to interact to be as low as possible
90:38 - server-side rendering is the answer to
90:40 - get that down
90:41 - damn awesome i think we
90:44 - complemented your words very nicely with
90:46 - the written
90:48 - yeah that's really nice awesome awesome
90:50 - so let's go here so what's this
90:52 - next.js so yeah next.js is one of the
90:55 - most popular uh server side rendering
90:57 - frameworks uh and it's very hot right
90:59 - now
90:59 - so if you're looking in this space i
91:01 - would recommend uh
91:02 - maybe look at preact preact is a very
91:05 - lightweight version of doing server side
91:06 - rendering
91:07 - but next.js is the one to use if you're
91:10 - gonna go ahead and do it in
91:12 - uh in a professional environment and i
91:13 - did actually use this so
91:15 - in america you have walmart in in
91:17 - england you have something called tesco
91:19 - tesco is like the size of walmart pretty
91:21 - much uh and it's
91:22 - they use next.js in that uh to render
91:25 - their web pages so
91:26 - it's massive um and basically it's it's
91:29 - extremely powerful it also offers a
91:31 - bunch of like
91:32 - power-ups to react out of the box so
91:34 - really really something to definitely go
91:36 - ahead and play with
91:37 - it's a different way of thinking um but
91:39 - it is kind of uh
91:40 - once you learn it it's gonna pay off the
91:42 - value will pay off it'll be very
91:43 - valuable to an employer
91:45 - yeah so it's definitely something which
91:47 - i recommend you guys go ahead and look
91:49 - at
91:49 - um it's also going to take you this will
91:51 - definitely take you guys
91:53 - from a mid-level front-end developer to
91:55 - a senior like that you need this to be
91:57 - to be considered like a senior level
91:59 - developer
92:00 - when we're talking about a seniority
92:02 - inside of a company
92:03 - dang that is powerful by the way guys
92:07 - are these captions that we're providing
92:09 - for what sonny's saying or what i am
92:11 - saying
92:12 - are these actually helpful and valuable
92:14 - to you but i mean to me sunny this is
92:16 - actually super helpful
92:17 - because it's almost like we're making a
92:19 - slide on the fly
92:20 - yeah honestly i found it i find it
92:22 - really really helpful even me reading
92:24 - over it it clears everything up so
92:26 - yeah definitely let us know in the
92:27 - comments guys if you guys find that
92:28 - valuable and if you do
92:29 - just simply hit the thumbs up button as
92:31 - well
92:31 - [Laughter]
92:34 - nice that was a clean
92:37 - just smooth one was my favorite because
92:40 - it didn't even make sense
92:41 - but i like it i like it
92:46 - yeah i love it okay so build time what
92:48 - am i looking at here
92:50 - right so this is actually moving on to
92:52 - the next thing which is called
92:54 - uh where if i think if you hit next it
92:55 - will jump up it was basically we were
92:57 - talking about statistics
92:58 - right i'm kidding generators so the text
93:01 - i think comes on the on the click yeah
93:03 - yeah so now we're talking about stack
93:05 - site generated so kazi what is a static
93:06 - site generator so
93:08 - you have you ever used one yeah you know
93:10 - me i'm just using jekyll
93:12 - like before i even knew what coding was
93:14 - i was freaking using
93:16 - jekyll like crazy i don't know anybody
93:18 - use jekyll here
93:19 - drop it in the comments below i think
93:22 - it's awesome we're in a blog post today
93:23 - and i
93:24 - started laughing because hugo
93:27 - right yeah yeah hugo yeah so i know like
93:30 - most of the people yeah i see ali and
93:32 - hendrick they're saying actually it's
93:34 - very helpful
93:35 - logan says very valuable 181 modis
93:37 - modesto says yes
93:40 - awesome so yeah this stuff are you
93:42 - laughing at what just sonny just said
93:44 - yeah frankie is laughing too so
93:47 - this is this is uh this makes your site
93:51 - really really fast the static site
93:53 - generators i think are kind of useful to
93:54 - know
93:55 - static site generators also uh github
93:58 - pages
93:58 - generate static sites right and but
94:01 - there are things like jekyll that you
94:03 - want to know where they can take your
94:04 - dynamic content and turn it into static
94:06 - sites
94:10 - i just find it so funny because when you
94:12 - said jekyll i had no idea what it meant
94:15 - yeah yeah you were so confused you're
94:18 - like what is this
94:21 - yeah guys basically what jekyll's going
94:22 - to do it's going to take all your
94:23 - content it's going to make it into one
94:25 - stack like bundle
94:26 - and then it's just going to serve that
94:27 - bundle whenever anyone requests or goes
94:30 - on to your page
94:30 - which is a lot faster than it sounds
94:33 - like uh typically when you go into a
94:34 - website that javascript that you've
94:36 - coded
94:37 - actually has to load dynamically on the
94:39 - browser but when you've got a static
94:40 - site generator
94:41 - you basically make that bundle once and
94:42 - it just serves it every time so
94:44 - really really handy to actually go ahead
94:46 - and build something and if you're
94:47 - looking for speed
94:48 - stacks site generators are your answer
94:50 - the most popular one
94:52 - is gatsby
94:56 - really really popular right now if
94:57 - you've got any kind of sales page
94:59 - e-commerce site or anything gatsby's a
95:01 - really really powerful thing or landing
95:02 - page or portfolio
95:04 - if you go ahead and build a portfolio
95:05 - and say this is written in gatsby
95:07 - uh it's going to be quite impressive to
95:09 - like show to an employer so
95:11 - i'd recommend that you do that if you
95:12 - have got a portfolio um
95:14 - really really awesome thing to go ahead
95:16 - and guys these are all things that you
95:18 - can just like
95:19 - add to your skill set like if you can
95:21 - say i know react that's great that's
95:22 - really good
95:23 - but if you can then go ahead and say i
95:24 - can do server side rendering my
95:26 - portfolio like i know a portfolio is
95:28 - very simple but if you can say this
95:29 - portfolio
95:30 - is server side rendered or like this
95:32 - portfolio is built on
95:34 - react or on gatsby it kind of just adds
95:36 - that sort of like oh
95:37 - like if i was an employer i would get
95:39 - butterflies in my tummy if you told me
95:41 - your
95:42 - freaking portfolio's on using next js
95:44 - i'd be like
95:46 - holy crap because because the employee
95:49 - is going to know
95:50 - though interview he just did that
95:53 - right crazy okay awesome so what's
95:57 - going on here so we got
95:59 - all the are these these are all the
96:00 - static site frameworks right
96:03 - yeah these are a lot of points and
96:04 - next.js is also a static site
96:06 - hey made it up here nice what's
96:10 - next bro i always hear about this it
96:12 - just sounds so dumb
96:14 - yeah i don't know i've actually i've
96:16 - heard about it but i've never looked
96:17 - into it all i know is gatsby in there i
96:19 - think they're only getting
96:20 - i think they're just getting clout from
96:23 - nextjs
96:23 - traffic that misspells it they down yeah
96:27 - next next by mistake uh
96:30 - next djs is the real one and then
96:33 - next is uh something else yeah this is
96:37 - proper stupid name
96:39 - so what's the difference between gatsby
96:41 - and next.js sonny
96:43 - so gatsby is just a static site
96:46 - generator guys
96:47 - nexjs handles server-side rendering and
96:50 - also gives you the static site generator
96:52 - um advantages so
96:54 - if you're looking at um sort of debating
96:57 - between the two
96:58 - i would recommend nextgs is going to
97:00 - provide you more value so i would go
97:02 - ahead and
97:02 - jump into that so your research app your
97:05 - react dynamic app you'll probably use
97:07 - next.js but maybe if you're hosting a
97:09 - portfolio or something static like that
97:12 - use gatsby
97:13 - yes because gatsby yeah a very good
97:15 - point now yeah gatsby's going to be
97:16 - quite easier to implement over in xjs
97:19 - so i'd recommend going ahead and using
97:21 - gatsby if you've got like a simple
97:23 - landing page or something fast
97:24 - you need up and running and you need it
97:26 - easy to maintain gatsby
97:28 - if you're looking for a long term
97:29 - benefit or you're looking for something
97:31 - to get something out there or you're
97:32 - trying to build your portfolio for a
97:34 - professional environment next yes
97:40 - yep so definitely something worth
97:42 - investing your time in
97:44 - awesome let's go to next
97:47 - uh oh somebody said
97:50 - next is typically next.js but for vue.js
97:55 - oh nice yeah and thank you
97:58 - the greatest ever says gonna be watching
98:00 - this tomorrow because i'm finishing up
98:01 - the spotify
98:02 - clone but wanna thank you guys deeply

98:13 - this slide was put together by sunny and
98:17 - also uh alex right now
98:20 - frankie yeah and amanoth
98:24 - from the clever programmer team i came
98:27 - in
98:27 - and help there are a bunch of slides
98:29 - that are coming in from like the
98:30 - previous slides
98:31 - that uh we had all made together frankie

98:50 - and also just taking the time to
98:52 - appreciate that
98:53 - thank you now thank you guys if you guys
98:57 - are still not sure how to get started
98:59 - or you guys want to figure out how to
99:00 - make money as a developer let me know
99:02 - are you guys interested
99:03 - in learning how to make money as a
99:05 - developer
99:06 - this part we wanted to add in for you
99:08 - guys to show you
99:09 - how you can actually start going out and
99:12 - making money
99:12 - as a front-end developer or whatever
99:16 - type of developer you want to become
99:18 - today so this will be the part with
99:20 - freelancing tips with tips of getting
99:22 - your jobs
99:23 - if you're interested let me know and
99:26 - let's go
99:27 - let's do it so the first avenue guys
99:31 - is what kazi the first avenue is
99:34 - becoming i love this becoming a teacher
99:38 - so you can actually with whatever skills
99:42 - you have learned
99:43 - you can actually teach that to other
99:45 - people and
99:46 - you can make an income from doing that
99:50 - like for example okay this is the
99:51 - craziest example but you guys see we're
99:53 - just teaching
99:54 - you guys we're teachers right sunny and
99:56 - i are teachers
99:58 - sunny and i are not just like going
100:01 - crazy working at a job right now we're
100:02 - actually taking the time out to actually
100:04 - teach you guys
100:06 - and we're even getting donations and
100:08 - we're getting paid to teach
100:10 - literally and so what it looks like at a
100:13 - one-on-one basis and
100:14 - is you can actually post your ad on
100:16 - craigslist
100:17 - and you could post your ads on kijiji if
100:20 - you're in canada or you can post your ad
100:22 - on
100:22 - really whatever platform you want and
100:24 - somebody can pay you for you to teach
100:26 - them
100:27 - and you don't have to be so far ahead of
100:29 - them you could just be a little bit
100:30 - ahead of them and charge them
100:32 - for teaching them yeah
100:36 - exactly and guys this is one this is one
100:38 - that i really emphasize
100:39 - in our course a lot with our students
100:41 - because this is the one that you
100:43 - can literally start doing even a week
100:45 - after you start learning how to code
100:47 - like
100:47 - if you're a week ahead of somebody who's
100:49 - never coded before
100:50 - you're now you're now in a position to
100:52 - provide a week's worth of value to
100:54 - somebody who's never coded before so you
100:55 - can actually go ahead and start teaching
100:57 - that
100:57 - right and then only from that day
100:59 - onwards that value only grows
101:01 - right so if you're immediately going to
101:03 - grow your income source and you and
101:05 - the earlier you start the better and it
101:07 - is uncomfortable but like when you just
101:09 - jump in dive into the deep end
101:10 - you're going to go ahead and build that
101:11 - skill and it's always going to be a
101:13 - skill that you can turn to to make some
101:14 - more income
101:15 - yep now this is one way that we'd like
101:18 - to show it to you guys okay so let me go
101:20 - ahead and do that
101:21 - for you guys so let's go ahead here and
101:23 - take a look at this what sunny is saying
101:25 - right so sunny
101:26 - you're saying if i have like literally
101:29 - if you think about levels right let's
101:31 - say you're a complete beginner and
101:32 - you're at level one
101:34 - you just know how to write hello world
101:37 - and then
101:37 - here is level 10 where you use
101:40 - server-side rendering for
101:42 - breakfast
101:44 - so in between all these levels
101:48 - and then let's say you're doing
101:49 - javascript you don't have to you can use
101:51 - any language
101:52 - python or you know go it doesn't matter
101:54 - but let's just use javascript for now
101:57 - and if you are a level one can you teach
102:01 - another level one
102:02 - probably not really right if all you
102:05 - know is hello world
102:07 - you can't really teach much to another
102:09 - person who also knows hello world
102:10 - so if you are over here
102:14 - and actually let's do this right so
102:16 - they're like let's say there's two
102:17 - people
102:18 - here and here yep and um you're
102:22 - like let's say you're on the left hand
102:23 - side and you're teaching this person
102:26 - okay yeah and this
102:29 - is over here i'm just gonna put a little
102:31 - mark and that's gonna say that's you
102:34 - okay now if you're teaching this person
102:36 - you're gonna
102:37 - they're gonna be paying you in return
102:40 - yep and um if you're a level two
102:46 - it's very possible that you can actually
102:47 - be teaching somebody who's a level one
102:50 - yep 100 right because you
102:54 - can you can teach them so like for
102:56 - example what does a level two mean maybe
102:58 - you have put in
102:58 - at level two maybe you've put in like 50
103:00 - hours into coding
103:03 - yeah okay let's say you know how to
103:05 - write functions
103:06 - loops data types you know that stuff
103:09 - yeah you know what array is you know
103:11 - what you know so for example right now
103:13 - you can charge this person you could
103:14 - charge them maybe like
103:15 - ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars
103:18 - an hour so i'll just put like
103:20 - you know ten dollars at that point you
103:22 - can charge them an
103:23 - hour okay now when you get up to level
103:27 - three
103:29 - and you can teach a level two
103:32 - you're gonna get paid more for that yeah
103:35 - does that make sense so now you might
103:37 - actually make maybe more than ten
103:39 - dollars an hour maybe now you make
103:41 - you now you can make like 18 an hour
103:43 - teaching
103:44 - i just want to stress here guys notice
103:46 - now that your pool of potential students
103:49 - has also grown now you can target level
103:51 - two and level one students
103:53 - yep you can target exactly that's
103:55 - important so you could target both
103:57 - that's huge
103:58 - that's a really good point and then what
104:01 - happens when you're a level
104:02 - four or you're a level five let's say
104:05 - right
104:06 - if you're a level five well what does a
104:08 - level five look like i think a level
104:09 - five is somebody who has
104:11 - put multiple uh you know they've like
104:13 - followed of all of our youtube videos
104:15 - and made all the clones
104:17 - yeah exactly you know they understand
104:19 - like how apis work
104:21 - they understand how uh you know how to
104:25 - put together like
104:26 - their portfolio and they have multiple
104:28 - projects to show for it
104:30 - maybe they don't have real world coding
104:32 - experience where they're getting paid at
104:33 - a job but other than that they're like
104:35 - pretty decent yeah right and that might
104:38 - actually
104:38 - look like what maybe 500 hours of coding
104:41 - or maybe
104:42 - yeah 500 to like 700 hours of coding
104:47 - yeah might actually put you here
104:51 - and now at this level you guys you guys
104:53 - can actually charge a pretty significant
104:55 - amount
104:56 - of income so if you're a level five and
104:58 - you're teaching level fours and stuff
105:00 - like that
105:00 - it's very possible for you guys to make
105:04 - at least in us you know for your own
105:06 - countries you would have to do the rough
105:08 - translation but in us it's very possible
105:12 - for you to charge 35
105:13 - an hour or even 50 an hour
105:17 - and you have experience with teaching
105:19 - people right sunny
105:20 - i definitely do yeah so even literally
105:22 - and guys there's no age limit when you
105:24 - come to teaching i've taught people who
105:25 - are like much older than me
105:27 - and i've also taught a student who was
105:28 - young as 12 years old who landed his own
105:30 - client which is insane like
105:32 - that's so it really does not matter what
105:34 - age or
105:35 - or what experience you're at you can
105:37 - teach yeah yep
105:38 - and so if you are teaching other people
105:41 - you just have to do the math right so at
105:43 - 35
105:44 - an hour you know i use teaching to make
105:47 - well over a hundred thousand dollars a
105:48 - year now of course everybody's gonna be
105:50 - at a different
105:51 - level different like how much effort you
105:53 - put into it how much time you put into
105:55 - it
105:55 - but a few of these clients that are
105:58 - paying you either 35
106:00 - or 50 an hour it the math
106:03 - to getting to 1 000
106:07 - a month like that's the first type of
106:09 - math you should do
106:10 - so let's figure out sunny how
106:14 - long would it take like what it would
106:15 - take for us with at fifty dollars an
106:17 - hour
106:18 - to get to making thousand dollars a
106:21 - month
106:21 - okay so if i'm making 50 generally when
106:26 - you have students they'll do
106:28 - about two hour long sessions how long
106:29 - are your sessions with your students
106:31 - they're one hour 30 minutes yeah
106:34 - typically i start with one hour
106:36 - because it's quite an intense session
106:37 - and then i'll eventually see and if they
106:40 - can handle a two-hour session
106:41 - so let's set two hours yeah i don't push
106:43 - more than two
106:44 - yeah okay because they get fried in that
106:46 - time so let's say you're doing one hour
106:49 - sessions yeah at fifty dollars an hour
106:54 - yeah right uh you're doing one session
106:56 - per week
106:58 - yep okay so one x per week that turns
107:01 - out to be four
107:03 - sessions per month right yep
107:07 - and uh how much is that you guys if you
107:09 - have one
107:10 - student at
107:14 - you know doing four times a month at 50
107:17 - an hour in one month that is
107:22 - two hundred dollars yeah
107:25 - now what happens if now what do we need
107:28 - to do sunny to get
107:29 - up to with the same exact math to get up
107:32 - to one thousand a month
107:35 - we just need to land five students
107:38 - yep guys that's it so or increase or
107:41 - increase the frequency of a student but
107:43 - landing five students is going to get
107:44 - you that yeah
107:45 - yep so you can go both ways it's
107:47 - important what sunny just said
107:48 - so you guys can either in it's really
107:51 - hard to increase the price at 50. i mean
107:53 - it's hard to go with that sooner
107:54 - to 75 or 100 to double the price would
107:56 - be tough
107:58 - but what might be a lot more doable is
108:00 - maybe sunny can start to have
108:01 - two hour lessons with those students and
108:03 - now that student will pay sunny 400
108:06 - a month yeah right exactly or
108:09 - sunny can get a total of five students
108:12 - uh
108:13 - for they each do four x a month sessions
108:17 - at 50 an hour and now
108:21 - that's a thousand dollars a month
108:24 - yeah and guys something i want to stress
108:26 - at this point when you get very good at
108:28 - having a lot more students and you can
108:31 - actually get to a point where you can do
108:32 - group sessions
108:34 - so if you find that you're running out
108:35 - of time where you find that you're
108:36 - getting like kind of intense with the
108:38 - timings
108:38 - you can go ahead and run i wouldn't
108:40 - recommend having large groups because
108:42 - you you lose the one to one
108:44 - but you can definitely go ahead and
108:45 - actually go ahead and split like maybe
108:47 - and have a group of three group of four
108:49 - yeah and you can even give them a
108:51 - discount right so for example if you
108:53 - were charging a 50 maybe you charge them
108:55 - 40
108:55 - per session yeah but now it's a group
108:57 - session so in one hour
108:59 - instead of you making 50 dollars now
109:01 - with three students you make 120
109:04 - in an hour of your time exactly
109:07 - and it's a good deal for all of them
109:10 - yeah it's actually a better deal than
109:11 - them doing one-on-one
109:12 - if they do because they all become a
109:14 - part of the group too
109:15 - and they can all slack each other they
109:17 - can all message each other
109:19 - so that's powerful definitely
109:22 - so i i think that one of the best ways
109:25 - for almost all of you guys including the
109:27 - ones who have a job i think is
109:29 - like guys what would you do if you had
109:31 - extra thousand dollars a month coming in
109:33 - start dropping it in the comments below
109:36 - you know
109:36 - what would the thousand dollars a month
109:38 - allow you to do would it allow you to
109:41 - you know pay your bills wouldn't would
109:43 - you get netflix membership would you get
109:45 - membership to i know gyms are closed but
109:48 - maybe would you get like calisthenics
109:49 - equipment for your home
109:51 - and then do workouts there would you
109:55 - get a course that you've always wanted
109:57 - would you
109:58 - i don't know pay for your parents rent
110:00 - and help out
110:02 - what would a thousand dollars a month
110:04 - allow you to do
110:06 - i think it's important to have those
110:07 - goals because then you will actually
110:09 - want to
110:10 - do more and achieve more other than
110:12 - rather than just like going through life
110:14 - like a zombie
110:16 - yeah and these guys it's really
110:18 - important to determine what your why is
110:20 - like why are you doing
110:22 - this stuff like why are you teaching why
110:23 - are you even here right now
110:25 - trying to learn how to code like
110:26 - remember that because that is going to
110:28 - give you
110:29 - that consistent discipline and
110:31 - motivation to carry on when times get
110:32 - tough
110:33 - yeah so like for example sunny can't sit
110:36 - there through like hundreds or thousands
110:38 - of hours of coding
110:40 - and then like through all the debugging
110:42 - and all the frustration of not making
110:44 - something work where literally he's
110:45 - trying to figure out
110:46 - one goddamn trick with flexbox and it
110:49 - takes them
110:50 - seven hours of like how does this grow
110:54 - shrink thing work or like why you know
110:57 - it's a 0.8 or a 0.9 flex
111:00 - and how does he or somebody like me get
111:05 - through
111:05 - so much coding if our why was weak and
111:09 - we didn't have a good reason we would
111:10 - not get through
111:11 - any of that you know if so it has to be
111:14 - something more important to you than
111:16 - just money
111:18 - exactly a few answers coming in though
111:21 - uh for what people would spend with a
111:23 - thousand so it would allow me to pay my
111:24 - rent
111:25 - uh and also pay my sibling fees and get
111:27 - to meet some of their basic needs
111:28 - awesome
111:30 - mark says i would invest in stuff and
111:32 - develop myself
111:34 - nice and uh ken laps as he uh get a wife
111:38 - [Laughter]
111:40 - nice douglas says i would join profit
111:43 - with javascript
111:44 - awesome hey um
111:47 - so let's go back to what we're talking
111:49 - about here you guys so
111:51 - now this is the math to getting to a
111:54 - thousand a month you guys
111:55 - it's not that freaking hard now to go to
111:59 - 2000 a month what do you need to do and
112:01 - guys here's a better way to look at it
112:03 - this is not a thousand a month
112:07 - this is actually let me write that up
112:09 - top at the top left
112:10 - this is actually five students
112:14 - is 12 000
112:17 - a year yeah that's the right way to look
112:22 - at it
112:22 - it's actually 5 000 or it's actually 12
112:25 - 000 a year
112:27 - yep and if you guys want to get to 24
112:31 - 000 a year or 2 000 a month
112:34 - 10 students
112:37 - and you guys can see the growth here
112:40 - from 5 to 10 students isn't actually a
112:42 - lot but the growth in your income is
112:43 - significant
112:45 - yes very significant so
112:48 - this is something you guys can do guys
112:50 - so easily
112:51 - like their instagram you can go and
112:54 - instagram people on coding channels and
112:56 - start having conversations with them and
112:58 - say i will help you for free
113:00 - for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on
113:03 - a video call with you and help you
113:05 - you can go into a facebook group and ask
113:08 - people if they need help and give them a
113:10 - free session and then at the end of the
113:12 - free session
113:13 - say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed
113:16 - this
113:16 - if you want me to help you more i'm um
113:19 - you know i charge
113:20 - 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge
113:23 - 35
113:23 - an hour 50 an hour something like that
113:25 - does that make sense you guys
113:27 - you guys can literally do this today you
113:30 - don't need to wait for anything you
113:32 - don't need to wait for anyone
113:34 - so this is possible for you guys now
113:37 - there are online
113:38 - tons of amazing platforms where you guys
113:40 - can go
113:41 - and start teaching so i will give you
113:45 - more ways of making income but this is
113:46 - actually one really big
113:48 - pillar of having your income come
113:51 - in so we'll talk about some of those
113:54 - platforms right now
113:56 - and then we're going to go ahead and
113:58 - continue with the video but there are
113:59 - important platforms that you guys should
114:01 - know and write down so one is
114:02 - takelessons.com
114:03 - and the other one is wiseand.com so
114:06 - these are really good platforms look
114:08 - in the u.s that are great for finding
114:11 - lessons but if you're not in the u.s
114:15 - look at people per hour look at
114:18 - fiverr.com
114:21 - yeah and um also you guys have
114:24 - facebook and instagram which is
114:25 - worldwide right you can go into
114:27 - groups programming groups and help
114:29 - people there
114:30 - and you can get clients from there very
114:33 - easily okay we have some students try
114:35 - this strategy and they literally have
114:37 - clients the next day and of course i
114:40 - think craigslist is worldwide
114:42 - so use craigslist as well and we'll list
114:45 - out all of these resources for you guys
114:47 - at the end
114:49 - and also guys one worth mentioning is
114:50 - instagram so literally if you just go
114:52 - ahead and document your journey as a
114:54 - developer
114:55 - you'll actually be surprised that how
114:56 - many people reach out and ask for help
114:58 - ask for this
114:59 - and you can actually then convert that
115:01 - to a potential student that you start
115:03 - teaching yep
115:04 - exactly so let's i'm gonna go ahead and
115:07 - now guys this
115:08 - works if you're working extremely hard
115:11 - and you can teach people who are
115:13 - you know literally one level behind you
115:15 - you don't have to be so
115:16 - far ahead of them to teach them remember
115:20 - so you can be a level two teaching a
115:22 - level one you can be a level five
115:23 - teaching everybody underneath it
115:25 - so yep let me go ahead and save this
115:29 - and then go here and i'm gonna remove
115:32 - this now
115:34 - cool so let's move forward here now
115:37 - i'm gonna skip through a little bit of
115:38 - this you guys and we're gonna go
115:40 - you know i even have some math here you
115:42 - can take a look at it but if you
115:44 - if you wanna go on the instagram route
115:47 - or facebook route where you kind of want
115:48 - to do hand to hand combat you can dm 100
115:51 - people
115:53 - something interesting like not please
115:56 - sorry mommy
115:57 - can you please i beg you we that's like
116:00 - 99 of the messages i get in my dms
116:03 - um so don't do that that'll be bad
116:05 - nobody will respond to you'll get
116:07 - ignored
116:08 - but if you give them a good message
116:10 - that's like positive
116:11 - hey i see you are crushing it at
116:16 - skateboarding absolutely love that and i
116:18 - see that you're also doing coding
116:20 - pump for you that's it don't ask
116:22 - anything
116:23 - don't want anything don't need anything
116:26 - don't beg
116:27 - don't put more than one question mark
116:29 - ever
116:30 - even in our chat if i ever see more than
116:32 - one question mark ever i'd never respond
116:34 - to that person
116:35 - so yeah um be
116:39 - clean be a clean giving caring human
116:42 - being
116:42 - and if you send those messages uh 20
116:45 - people out of the 100 will respond to
116:47 - you
116:48 - okay five
116:51 - will get on you can get on a call with
116:53 - five of those people if you close one
116:54 - person
116:55 - that's just from one client you're gonna
116:56 - make 320 a month now you can do this
116:59 - strategy whether you want to freelance
117:00 - and actually code for people and build
117:03 - websites or
117:04 - build apps for them and this will work
117:06 - for you even if you want to do it for
117:07 - coaching
117:08 - okay this works for both now one student
117:12 - or
117:12 - one client can be worth up to
117:15 - three to four thousand a year if not
117:17 - more just one
117:19 - all right so that is a pretty important
117:22 - and helpful thing
117:23 - for you guys to know now if you want to
117:25 - go from
117:26 - 3 000 a month and you're like hey how do
117:29 - i actually take that from 3 000
117:31 - um and go you know that 3 000 a month
117:35 - guys is actually 36 000 a year so
117:38 - yeah this is that's always important to
117:40 - kind of remember that

118:03 - which you'd be surprised
118:04 - actually works upwork fiverr linkedin is

118:11 - and go on and linkedin is something
118:12 - where it's like a growth thing like you
118:14 - build up that network
118:15 - and you'll be surprised at what like if
118:17 - somebody would just share your name and
118:19 - say i know a guy
118:20 - who can code and before you know it you
118:22 - have a lot of my
118:23 - sort of jobs have actually been through

122:14 - yep
122:15 - um so awesome love you guys so now let's
122:19 - move on to
122:20 - mark says i am already on linkedin and
122:23 - upwork but i still see myself as a
122:24 - beginner but i'm hungry
122:26 - guys don't say no for the other person
122:30 - this is one thing i learned from garyvee
122:31 - which is beautiful
122:33 - apply to the job that you're thinking
122:35 - about you know
122:36 - actually like send out the messages on
122:40 - take lessons wisen or whatever platforms
122:42 - to get
122:42 - clients you know uh if you're a beginner
122:46 - maybe you can still provide some value
122:48 - you know at the very worst case you can
122:50 - give refund or you can give the money
122:51 - back guarantee
122:52 - right but don't say no for the other
122:54 - person go all the way
122:57 - now with that said let's continue
123:00 - on here so boom got tons of things so
123:03 - working from home now you guys can use
123:05 - tons of online platforms if you want to
123:07 - do
123:08 - freelancing the reason why we mentioned
123:10 - teaching is i think it's the easiest
123:11 - thing to get into
123:12 - it's also a thing you can scale up
123:14 - forever like we're teaching you right
123:16 - now
123:17 - exactly so talk to me about this sonny
123:22 - yeah so we spoke about number one which
123:23 - was teaching and that's definitely
123:25 - something you guys can do right now
123:27 - but when you obviously in teaching i
123:28 - just want to add to one thing guys like
123:29 - when you teach
123:31 - it makes you such a better developer
123:33 - like i can't stress that enough every
123:35 - single live stream that we teach every
123:36 - single
123:37 - time i teach a student i become a better
123:39 - developer because you're teaching that
123:41 - principle you're teaching the ability to
123:42 - code
123:43 - so you get actually naturally just
123:45 - become a better developer so
123:46 - you'll naturally grow to a position
123:48 - where you can offer value to clients
123:50 - you can offer value and that's where
123:52 - freelancing comes in as number two
123:53 - so three really good sites here to land
123:56 - freelancing clients we've got upwork
123:58 - freelancer.com and top tool right yeah
124:01 - the one
124:01 - sort of recommend here as being the most
124:03 - successful is upwork because
124:04 - freelancer.com
124:05 - you can get into sort of some battles
124:07 - with sort of a trying to bid for things
124:09 - but
124:10 - again if you build up quite a handsome
124:12 - sort of portfolio on freelancer.com i've
124:13 - seen people do really really well on
124:15 - that
124:16 - and guys a really nice benefit to
124:18 - freelancing is also
124:19 - it's remote so most of you um who are
124:22 - watching from different parts of the
124:23 - world right now
124:24 - you guys can tap into different markets
124:26 - you can tap into the united states you
124:27 - can tap into london
124:29 - you can tap into any market you want
124:30 - provided you just build that skill
124:32 - you build that skill the ability to
124:34 - freelance is is in literature and guys
124:36 - this is one thing i want to stress here
124:37 - you can scale to
124:39 - very very high numbers when you're just
124:40 - freelancing big numbers
124:42 - uh we had uh we have a student in our
124:44 - program profitable shortcut last month
124:46 - he called me
124:47 - he closed he did 28 000 in cash
124:51 - from freelancing he
124:54 - did and then within the first 10 days of
124:57 - um
124:58 - i think yeah within the first 10 days of
125:00 - the next month after that
125:01 - this guy did uh 12 000 already
125:05 - so that's insane crushing it and
125:07 - freelancing and doing
125:08 - scraping web scraping and automation
125:12 - and all kinds of things but he's just
125:14 - hustling and grinding and getting it
125:16 - done
125:16 - there's tons of opportunity out there
125:18 - but people just
125:19 - you know they just don't take advantage
125:21 - of it um
125:25 - awesome so by the way i want to say guys
125:27 - we just broke
125:28 - 20 000 views on this video total
125:31 - over 20 000 times it's been viewed so
125:34 - thank you guys so much for the love and
125:36 - i do want to say a lot of it is because
125:37 - of
125:38 - you watching this and you hitting that
125:40 - like button because it helped
125:42 - it did help send it out to more and more
125:44 - people
125:45 - and if you're watching this and you
125:46 - still haven't done that go ahead and
125:48 - just hit that like button because
125:50 - guys we want to make as many developers
125:53 - on the planet as possible that's our
125:55 - mission
125:57 - exactly and uh that's awesome
126:00 - so now you know boom with that said you
126:03 - know
126:04 - the third step that you guys would want
126:05 - to do is so
126:07 - you know the second thing we talked
126:08 - about is freelancing the third is
126:10 - getting a permanent job that's a lot of
126:12 - what people want to do
126:14 - but people go about it i feel like kind
126:16 - of in a backwards way
126:18 - where the first thing that they're
126:19 - looking for is a permanent job and
126:20 - that's really
126:21 - hard to get you guys when you're just
126:24 - starting out as a developer and that's
126:25 - why
126:26 - most people i know quit most people i
126:29 - know
126:30 - quit within one year almost every single
126:32 - person
126:33 - very few people stay after that one year
126:37 - mark and end up getting a job
126:39 - so i think that's a very discouraging
126:40 - route to go i think it's not the
126:42 - smartest or even the fastest route
126:44 - to go i think the fastest route to grow
126:46 - skill wise
126:47 - is to first teach it's going to grow
126:49 - your own skills
126:50 - the most you're going to be getting paid
126:53 - while you're learning yourself
126:56 - and then i think step two you should try
126:58 - to get so
126:59 - i think with uh you should start
127:01 - teaching
127:02 - in your first three months of coding
127:04 - okay you should start teaching within
127:06 - that time frame
127:07 - then around your sixth or ninth month
127:10 - you should actually start doing
127:11 - freelancing
127:13 - and then after a year or year and a half
127:17 - of experience i think you should go for
127:18 - a full job uh definitely curious to hear
127:21 - your thoughts on this too sonny
127:23 - yeah i would definitely say guys and i
127:25 - just want to kind of rule out a myth
127:26 - here so the way that you typically see
127:28 - this is like as you said it's very
127:30 - backwards right like
127:31 - what i usually see is people will go to
127:33 - university and then they would like
127:35 - study for three four years
127:37 - never had made a single penny when it
127:39 - comes to like their coding abilities
127:41 - and then they would go straight to step
127:42 - three which is a permanent job and you
127:44 - see like it just doesn't make sense like
127:45 - it doesn't make any sense like
127:47 - literally you could watch your youtube
127:49 - videos and you could sit there teach
127:50 - yourself how to code through like
127:52 - youtube videos
127:53 - through us guys through um through w3
127:55 - schools or a bunch of online resources
127:57 - start teaching like through the methods
127:59 - we spoke about before
128:00 - start earning an income and then you
128:02 - build up that skill set from teaching
128:04 - you build up the ability to build up an
128:06 - income
128:06 - and you can grow that income at a rate
128:08 - that's very comfortable for you
128:10 - you then become a better programmer you
128:11 - can learn freelance clients
128:13 - and then all of that experience becomes
128:16 - extremely attractive
128:18 - to a an employer and that's not a secret
128:20 - to it
128:21 - that's a secret to having years of
128:23 - experience
128:24 - before ever having a job exactly
128:28 - you know that like it's almost like a
128:29 - circular thing that everybody always
128:31 - talks about you know it's like you must
128:32 - have two years of experience and it's an
128:34 - entry-level job and you're like
128:35 - [Music]
128:37 - yeah exactly and the truth is guys if
128:40 - you go to an employer and they said five
128:41 - years experience and you only had one
128:43 - year but your one year
128:44 - consisted of you teaching a bunch of
128:46 - students
128:47 - killing it with freelancing jobs i'm
128:49 - telling you they would forget about that
128:51 - five years of experience and they would
128:52 - consider taking you on board yeah like
128:54 - it really does it just comes down to
128:56 - what you can offer them
128:58 - in terms of value so honestly focus on
129:00 - what you can like
129:01 - provide in terms of value and that skill
129:03 - that you can offer
129:04 - as opposed to going the traditional
129:06 - route of like university
129:08 - and then straight to the permanent
129:09 - position it just doesn't work that way
129:10 - in real life cold wakeman says i don't
129:12 - like teaching can i just do step two
129:14 - straight away yeah i mean it's gonna as
129:16 - long as you can develop
129:18 - the skill of coding and keep getting
129:20 - good yeah you can do step two of uh
129:23 - freelancing pretty much right away so
129:24 - here's how i break it down you guys so
129:26 - we call this the modern javascript
129:28 - developer pyramid of wealth
129:30 - and i we feel like this is how you can
129:32 - kind of stack all this on top of each
129:34 - other
129:34 - so one it's learn the coding skills to
129:36 - become a modern javascript developer so
129:38 - that's just coding skills
129:40 - learn that step two is you can start
129:42 - coaching people
129:43 - now this is a you can be a beginner and
129:46 - coach other people
129:47 - and the time to build the stream of
129:49 - income is one to three months
129:51 - all right yep and you can get this
129:54 - stream of income
129:55 - up to three thousand dollars a month if
129:57 - not more this is more on the
129:58 - conservative side
130:00 - and uh next up you can actually
130:03 - work freelance so this is you can work
130:06 - for clients independently and you can
130:07 - get this
130:08 - up to now you can get with just
130:10 - freelancing alone
130:12 - you can realistically be making 5k a
130:14 - month
130:15 - right sunny yeah 100 and guys again like
130:18 - as you said this is conservative so you
130:20 - can actually raise those numbers up
130:22 - divided on how hard you're working and
130:24 - you can build a stream of income within
130:26 - for your first four to 12 months of
130:28 - learning to code
130:29 - okay first four to 12 months just put in
130:32 - a lot of hours into coding okay a lot of
130:34 - people are like hey how did i start
130:36 - uh getting clients in three months of
130:38 - experience
130:39 - i just coded like 15 to 20 hours a day
130:43 - yeah and then guys just to just add on
130:46 - there guys
130:47 - it stacks up so while you have the
130:49 - freelancing you can carry on the
130:50 - coaching so it can stack up yeah
130:52 - yep i love that quan quang says you guys
130:55 - are so good in the community's
130:57 - standard is so high i haven't even seen
130:59 - one negative comment so far
131:02 - amazing i love that yep so this is the
131:04 - power of culture you guys you keep and
131:06 - appreciate the
131:07 - people you love you over nurture and
131:10 - love them
131:11 - and then anybody who's toxic you cut
131:13 - them so you don't have a long
131:14 - conversation with them you don't have a
131:16 - long back and forth
131:17 - you don't try to change their minds you
131:20 - just
131:21 - uh you just not communicate with them
131:24 - and you you they're not part of the
131:26 - culture anymore so that's how you can
131:28 - keep the culture at the highest standard
131:30 - possible at all times this is also true
131:32 - when it comes to your circle of friends
131:34 - you might be outgrowing because you're
131:36 - here i mean you
131:38 - here learning about front-end developer
131:40 - guide i can promise you a lot of your
131:41 - friends are probably not doing this
131:43 - right now
131:44 - a lot of the people around you are not
131:45 - doing this and they're not growth
131:47 - oriented
131:48 - so you also have to start thinking about
131:51 - who are the people that are not
131:53 - anymore a good fit for your circle so
131:56 - you have to actually
131:58 - one part of self growth is to be really
132:00 - loving and over nurturing and be really
132:02 - accepting
132:03 - the second part of self growth is having
132:05 - self-respect and boundaries
132:06 - so those people aren't going to grow
132:08 - with you and aren't going to respect you
132:11 - then you have to move on and get a new
132:14 - set of friends
132:15 - right and then those set of friends they
132:17 - have to go
132:19 - yeah exactly and i i couldn't agree more
132:22 - in terms of like
132:23 - that negativity guys it's it's like a
132:24 - toxic sort of trait and it does spread
132:27 - like
132:28 - it's might start off with a small
132:29 - comment here and there but that will
132:31 - literally
132:31 - can destroy your work ethic if you stay
132:34 - around it long enough
132:35 - whereas if you surround yourself with
132:36 - hard-working people who are literally
132:38 - driven every single day
132:40 - i'm telling you you will literally just
132:42 - you start to mask their behavior you
132:44 - start to master their
132:45 - their sort of traits and then naturally
132:46 - you follow the same footsteps
132:48 - so really really is important to
132:50 - surround yourself with the white people
132:51 - yep super important and the last thing i
132:55 - want to mention is you guys the step
132:56 - four
132:57 - is to go get a job and work as a
132:59 - full-time developer
133:01 - now required skill level for this is
133:02 - advanced
133:04 - okay which is why we think you should
133:06 - try to do this last
133:07 - and then time to build the stream of
133:09 - income is 12 to 24
133:11 - months all right so this is gonna take
133:14 - 12 to 24 months and again it all stacks
133:16 - so you could
133:17 - be coaching and making 3k a month on top
133:20 - of that you could be freelancing and
133:21 - making 5k a month so now you're at 8k a
133:23 - month
133:24 - and then on top of that i mean this is
133:26 - probably going to get really hard or
133:28 - almost impossible you're you can have no
133:29 - time and no freedom to do anything
133:31 - but you could also be doing a job that's
133:34 - paying you like 7k a month
133:36 - so it's possible that you could have a
133:39 - potential of 15k a month or more income
133:42 - okay uh it depends on your hard work
133:45 - depends on what you do i'm just showing
133:47 - you guys this
133:47 - to see what's possible i'm not saying
133:49 - any of you will actually achieve this
133:51 - okay can i just add here guys that
133:53 - literally when i started working with
133:55 - qazi
133:56 - i had a full-time job i was freelancing
133:58 - on the side
133:59 - and i was coaching so oh living yeah
134:02 - like i did all of those things
134:04 - now like kazi said is it something you
134:06 - can really hold on to like with all of
134:08 - them stacked on top of each other
134:10 - it really depends on how you manage your
134:11 - time but then i chose to sort of drop
134:13 - the freelancing and work like
134:15 - full time with kazi and like and and to
134:16 - carry on with coaching so
134:18 - it's really a case of like it's very
134:19 - flexible but you can actually do all
134:22 - three
134:22 - like you can do all three if you need to
134:24 - and you're in a position it's all
134:26 - down to how hard you're willing to work
134:28 - and the effort that you're willing to
134:29 - put in
134:30 - yep it really comes down to you um
134:34 - yep so this is awesome harish says you
134:37 - guys are awesome you guys boost the
134:39 - confidence in
134:40 - all of us all right so there you guys go
134:43 - if you guys want to take a picture of
134:45 - this go ahead and do so now i'll be
134:46 - moving this uh in five four three two
134:50 - one so let's go on to the next one
134:51 - so now guys if you want to be able to
134:54 - take all of these skills that we taught
134:55 - you right being uh if you want to be
134:57 - able to like
134:58 - learn if you want to be able to coach
135:01 - if you want to do freelancing and job
135:04 - and you want to
135:04 - stack these skills and these streams of
135:07 - income in this exact order
135:09 - that's exactly what we teach you how to
135:12 - do in our course profit with javascript
135:15 - all right yeah and in this course you
135:17 - know we have tons of students and they
135:19 - just have
135:19 - really really great experiences and
135:22 - daniel over here says in the future i'll
135:23 - continue to learn more and teach
135:25 - students
135:26 - we have muhammad he says i hope this
135:28 - community will be part of my future
135:29 - projects
135:30 - johnny bridge going i have zero coding
135:32 - experience i'm proud of creating my
135:34 - google maps app
135:35 - kate says thank you so much for this
135:37 - challenge and
135:38 - in the future i want to be a full stack
135:40 - developer and start freelancing so these
135:42 - are all the people that are part of our
135:43 - community
135:45 - and um let me talk just a little bit
135:49 - more is it okay if i talk a little bit
135:50 - more about profit with javascript you
135:52 - guys because of course we've
135:54 - just invested so much time and energy
135:56 - into building it out and making it the
135:58 - best
135:59 - possible resource on the planet for most
136:01 - developers
136:02 - so i would really appreciate it if sonny
136:04 - and i could speak on it for
136:06 - probably like a few minutes yeah
136:09 - definitely yeah so let me go over here
136:13 - and open this up
136:16 - boom while kazi does that guys i think
136:19 - it's worth uh
136:20 - actually telling you guys so i know we
136:21 - showed a few of those customer
136:23 - experiences there but
136:24 - we actually just hit over i think it's
136:26 - over 1500 students in the community
136:29 - right
136:30 - oh yeah yeah yeah so
136:34 - that is absolutely insane and i think i
136:36 - will show that in just a second
136:38 - to everybody so guys in our profit with
136:40 - javascript course
136:42 - uh this is our program profit with
136:44 - javascript
136:46 - and we have the url up here so you can
136:48 - go to it directly or
136:50 - you can click the link in the
136:52 - description below
136:54 - and that will take you to this page
136:56 - right away
136:57 - but this course profit with javascript
136:59 - we cover all of these things we talked
137:01 - about
137:02 - so you learning the skills of becoming a
137:05 - developer
137:07 - you learning how to become a you know
137:10 - so it has the 15 javascript training
137:12 - modules that will give you all the
137:14 - training that you actually need
137:17 - right underneath that if you look you
137:19 - have weekly javascript and react
137:22 - training calls and son you want to speak
137:24 - to the weekly training calls
137:26 - live yeah so guys like this is where we
137:29 - really
137:30 - like differentiate from like a udemy
137:32 - course or anything else that's kind of
137:33 - out there right now because
137:35 - in these coaching calls and in these
137:36 - live training course it's a really a
137:38 - chance for you to be able to actually
137:40 - communicate and run through your
137:41 - problems with us
137:42 - that you're experiencing we run through
137:44 - different
137:45 - very cutting edge projects every single
137:48 - week so
137:49 - literally it's a case of you're not on
137:51 - like a live stream you're on a zoom call
137:53 - so you're literally on a video call with
137:55 - me with nars
137:57 - with jacob with a few people in the
137:58 - community and guys like what i mean it's
138:00 - one to one feedback here like
138:02 - there's people asking questions you can
138:04 - interrupt me at any time we got we
138:06 - literally take things to a whole new
138:07 - level in these coaching calls
138:09 - and our students love it they literally
138:11 - thrive off of it
138:12 - afterwards there's an amazing slack
138:14 - community where they literally send me
138:15 - messages of the sort of homework that we
138:17 - sat
138:17 - that we go through together um we have
138:20 - an amazing
138:21 - pool of success coaches and cars what is
138:23 - a success coach
138:24 - success coaches are going to be people
138:27 - when you join the program you're going
138:28 - to be paired up with a success coach
138:30 - and what they will do is every single
138:33 - project that you actually submit
138:35 - or every homework assignment that you
138:38 - complete or every app that you build
138:40 - they're going to give you personalized
138:42 - video
138:43 - feedback on all of your assignments
138:47 - so imagine getting video feedback by
138:49 - somebody who's a lot more seasoned than
138:50 - you
138:51 - and as a skilled developer or sometimes
138:53 - they're even professionals
138:55 - and they give you feedback on your code
138:57 - they give you feedback on your app
138:58 - design
139:00 - and we get very technical with that so
139:02 - those are
139:03 - success coaches and they make sure that
139:05 - you're getting
139:06 - all of the work done exactly
139:09 - and guys a lot of people actually say
139:11 - when you combine the weekly coaching
139:13 - calls with the personalized video
139:15 - feedback
139:16 - the modules that you get and then on top
139:18 - of that all of the skills that we then
139:19 - go and
139:20 - like we teach you that and then we teach
139:21 - you actually how how to go and take
139:23 - those skills
139:24 - and start making money straight away
139:26 - with that our students are pretty much
139:28 - called this like a 10 it's worth it
139:29 - pretty much the equivalent of a 10k
139:31 - coding boot camp yeah
139:32 - my opinion go ahead in my opinion i
139:35 - honestly i've been to university i've
139:37 - done a master's degree
139:38 - and this is what i would have like if i
139:40 - knew something like this existed i just
139:42 - don't think
139:43 - i actually tell students now don't
139:44 - bother going to university just join
139:46 - like a course or community and change
139:48 - your life through this where you save
139:49 - yourself a lot of money
139:50 - and literally will transform your life
139:52 - and take you to that whole nother
139:54 - level of becoming a developer yeah this
139:56 - seriously will is a game changer you
139:58 - know and so
139:59 - that's why jose shapiro he told me he's
140:03 - like dude this is actually more valuable
140:05 - than my six-month coding bootcamp
140:07 - and he goes i paid ten thousand dollars
140:08 - for that one
140:10 - so yeah amazing you know so a lot of
140:13 - students are getting amazing
140:14 - results like you guys should go and
140:16 - check this out
140:18 - and uh i want to highlight the community
140:20 - real quick for you guys so you guys can
140:22 - see
140:22 - the caliber of people in the community
140:24 - that's actually part of
140:26 - profit with javascript well it actually
140:28 - full screen hold on so i'm gonna open up
140:30 - my app
140:31 - so this is actually a good app that you
140:33 - guys should know about it's called
140:34 - spectacle
140:36 - and it's really good for um
140:40 - man my computer is just freezing
140:44 - yeah i use spectacular it's really handy
140:46 - tool guys when you want to snap things
140:48 - to the left side of the screen right
140:49 - side screen
140:50 - go full screen really really cool um
140:53 - especially when you're sort of trying to
140:54 - be productive
140:55 - yeah yeah super valuable so i'm gonna
140:58 - click this and hopefully my computer
140:59 - doesn't freeze
141:00 - but the guys the community is absolutely
141:02 - insane in this program and we have over
141:05 - 13 we have now 1 400 members just in our
141:09 - slack community
141:10 - and this is not we're not even talking
141:12 - about the 1500
141:14 - uh students that are just part of the
141:15 - course so
141:18 - that community is really what makes most
141:20 - students who come to the program stay
141:22 - they love the training they love all the
141:25 - material that's there they love all the
141:26 - projects
141:27 - but the fact that any question you have
141:30 - can
141:30 - can and will be answered in less than
141:33 - five minutes
141:35 - is massive for people and it will be
141:37 - answered by somebody who deeply cares
141:40 - by somebody who would even be sometimes
141:42 - willing to jump on one-on-one calls with
141:43 - you so the heart
141:45 - that is really important and
141:48 - um the weekly calls you guys will have i
141:50 - mean of course you guys are building
141:52 - real world projects so i think if you
141:54 - are serious about becoming
141:56 - a developer and you want to get a job
141:58 - then i would highly recommend you check
142:00 - out this

143:11 - check that out and with that said guys
143:13 - hopefully you guys got a ton of value i
143:15 - mean we just packed it with value the
143:17 - front end developer guide
143:19 - 2020 to 2021 uses
143:22 - as your bible for success uses your
143:26 - bible
143:26 - for a career as a front-end developer or
143:29 - honestly a lot of what we said works as
143:31 - a full stack developer as well
143:33 - so you know the recap of like learning
143:35 - about firebase and react and
143:37 - javascript and visual studio code and
143:41 - you know uh what best framework to use
143:43 - for testing like cypress io
143:46 - what are the pre processors that you
143:48 - should use
143:49 - you know for css and we talked about
143:52 - server side rendering
143:54 - and how the difference between a
143:56 - mid-level you know
143:57 - developer versus a senior level is
143:59 - knowing things like next js and
144:01 - using those types of things we talked
144:03 - about static side generators like gatsby
144:06 - or jekyll or hugo and all of that and we
144:08 - said hey use gatsby
144:10 - learn it so there's so much value that
144:14 - was packed in this and we just threw it
144:16 - all at you guys just make sure
144:18 - to keep going back to this to keep
144:20 - taking notes and really just following
144:22 - along
144:22 - i think personally i think
144:26 - honestly the most valuable part if i was
144:28 - watching this video
144:30 - is the part that shows you practically
144:32 - how to turn this into cash for yourself
144:35 - so yeah really pay attention to that and
144:39 - take action on it that's the one part
144:41 - that most people don't take action on
144:43 - so i just want to emphasize that yeah
144:46 - really really massive there guys in
144:48 - terms of because what you'll see here
144:49 - typically on websites and then just
144:51 - throughout
144:51 - the internet is like you'll find all of
144:53 - these skills how to do it and then you
144:55 - just don't know
144:56 - how to take that to that next level and
144:58 - that really does become a question and
145:00 - it kind of puts you in this horrible
145:01 - place
145:01 - it's very disheartening makes you kind
145:03 - of want to give up on programming so
145:05 - we really hope that we helped you out
145:07 - today and just in
145:08 - how to take that to that point of where
145:10 - you can actually start making income and
145:12 - you can actually enjoy the process a lot
145:13 - more
145:14 - because when you start earning from this
145:15 - you really do start to love it that
145:17 - extra bit
145:18 - and it starts to become that it starts
145:19 - to drive your life and change your life
145:21 - yep so that's it you guys thank you so

Cleaned transcript:

sunny guys how is it going super pumped for today we're gonna be covering the front end developer guide of 2020 to 2021 sunny are you excited about this or what i'm super excited we have so much jampacked knowledge for you guys like we just we're excited for this one like and guys if you're excited let us know in the comments drop a thumbs up and yeah get ready for this man we are pumped about this one guys this one just doesn't stop in terms of the value so buckle up buttercup because this is about to be one bumpy ride exactly so we're gonna so this is gonna be essentially your road map to becoming a frontend developer you know uh in this year and hopefully the next year even with all the crazy stuff going on so first off sunny what should they do with their phones guys grab your phones right now and hit that do not disturb button because you're going to need all of your attention right now because we're going to be going at a very very intense rate and we're going to be dropping a bunch of value bombs on you guys so ready get ready to focus hit that do not disturb button and put your phone way across to the other side of the room yup get into that focus mode if you have extra chrome tabs open quit out of them because today we're just bringing the value bombs this is going to be one of the most value packed uh this is the best video on this topic for a fact and we're just gonna make it even better so we're gonna give you our attention give us yours and with that said let's just keep it rocking and rolling so let's move forward now here's where the first donation nice oh nice sushan thank you so much our second donation vishal yeah thank you guys i really appreciate you guys so i'm gonna show here sushant thank you so much so here's where the fun begins and if you're thinking where do i begin right it doesn't matter just start i think that's the really important thing now let's just get straight into it so what's happening here sonny right so guys like we always get this question of like are we talking about front end are we talking about back end today everything we cover guys is going to be front end and what do we mean by front end right we mean what you're going to see on the websites all of the builds that we're doing are frontend builds at the moment um and then if we click on the uh click on the next i think the javascript should pop up right now yeah um and basically guys whenever we talk about javascript we're talking about the front end whenever you hear about node.js we're talking about backend right so backend is some server somewhere else but it's not the website that you're seeing when you're interacting with like amazon when you're interacting with twitter and those sort of things the back end is separate we're going to be talking about that in a different video today everything we talk about is front end right so just know that before we jump into this video love it karthik says your content is more worth than any other paid courses out there really appreciate that okay so here is what's going on so we got html css and javascript and what is what is what are we looking at why is this important right so these are the fundamentals guys that we're going to be covering so the three main things that you need to know about when it comes to front and web development are html css and javascript they are the three power points in this uh in this presentation they are literally everything that you need to be like concentrated on on getting better at when it comes to front end development 100 and now let's talk about job opportunities and salary for frontend developers guys so here are the salaries for javascript developers by experience and like take a look at this right less than one year of experience it's possible for people to make 62 000 a year and in 2020 75 000 a year and then going down you know one to four years you can see the salaries keep increasing but i know most of the people that are watching this channel have less than one year of experience so if you just put your head down not complain don't look up don't change your focus every two minutes and just put in the work i'm talking eight to ten hours or more per day if you can do that it's very possible for you to be hitting these numbers actually even way before the one year mark definitely and guys some of you might be wondering it's in dollars and i'm not in america it does not matter guys with the internet you can pretty much work for anyone your client could be in america and you could get paid in dollars so this applies to everyone yep it applies to everyone so the job opportunity is really crazy there are 45 000 jobs available as of right this second on justindeed.com for javascript on upwork if you look there are 8 000 jobs available and you guys can go there right now and they're probably even more because of kovitz so guys job opportunities only going up while a lot of people are losing their jobs that are doing a lot of physical stuff programmers are not exactly here you have what's going on here and we just got a 400 repeat donation from simba so thank you so much for that he says learn a lot today finish your instagram clone today uh quality content for free and i think this is about five dollars or six dollars usd so thank you so much nice now what are we looking at here sonny so we're looking at sort of the different um programming languages in terms of popularity guys so in terms of professional developers you can see at the top at the top two right now javascript html css those were those three that we just mentioned before in regards to front end development and you can see they've overtaken java they've overtaken python they've overtaken sql so if you're ever in that question of wondering what do what should i learn should i learn java should i learn this and that guys put your energy towards javascript html css and like we said there's plenty of money that's what you need to know moving can't go wrong with that now when we were talking earlier about different countries right it doesn't matter if you're in india you're in turkey you're in i don't know god knows where you're sitting in dubai and you're like what's happening you guys can always tap into these markets remotely whether you tap into the u.s market or the canada market or united kingdom or germany you guys can tap into this in u.s you can see average developers making fifty seven hundred a month which comes out to about to sixty thousand a year canada they're making about four thousand united kingdom thirty one hundred germany thirty nine so really these countries are so massive that it doesn't matter where you are you can always get jobs in these types of countries now top tech companies that are using javascript on you talk to us about this we have loads guys we have tinder uber paypal tesla netflix google ebay facebook the list just goes on guys and it you know it's a lot of these we actually went ahead and built some clones for so if you haven't checked those out make sure you go and check them out and you can practice your web development frontend skills doing those clones but like that you guys can see here there's huge money the industry is packed with javascript right now there's so there's so much demand here guys so really really is something worth investing your time in the tinder clone we recently built you guys is huge so go check that out we're thinking about making an airbnb one we made netflix so check that out we make facebook messenger clone look at that and we want to say we just broke over 500 concurrent viewers at once so thank you guys so much for that uh it's i see it's only going up i see the chat is going crazy i'm looking at a lot of your guys's messages so benny mr varun sanskari rajibura george fidelia like we're looking at all of this thank you guys and if you guys are watching this whether as a replayer watching this live right now with us please guys one thing you can do we spend hours and hours preparing all this material for you guys sunny put together over a hundred slides for you guys for this presentation so it's just value packed all we ask for is that if you want to appreciate sonny's work or you want to appreciate just our work and teams effort and energy to put into this doesn't cost anything just hit that like button please and it sends the video out to every single person so many more people that could get value out of this so if you just do that and you do nothing else that makes the world of a difference for us yeah guys just hit that thumbs up get this video out to as many people tell your friends to everyone watching let's get this video to as many people as we possibly can yep with that said let's just go right back so now this is the overall lay of the land so to speak when you think about a frontend developer there's a lot going on and now as we get more advanced you know back in the day maybe it was just you needed an html css and maybe javascript and your friend and developer now guys it's definitely a lot more involved because a lot of jobs expect you to know a lot of things so you got to learn the tools like npm webpack chrome dev tools this is some of the stuff that we're going to be covering in this presentation today you got to know html you gotta know css and pre pro processors like post css less and sas or scss you guys will need to know frameworks like angular or view or react which one kind of do you want to pick right you will need to know things like javascript or typescript and you will need to know about component libraries what's your flavor of choice is it bootstrap we talked about bootstrap 5 actually yesterday is a semantic ui or material ui you know where are you at exactly and i see a lot of questions about typescript guys we will be covering all of the things that you guys see here in this video so stay tuned and uh be sure that we are going to cover those yeah prince says in this lockdown i've learned a lot of things from you guys thanks to both of you for all of this free valuable content thank you so much thank you dude pretty cool now what can you do with javascript sunny oh nice we just got a three pound donation by is thank you dude appreciate thank you seriously appreciate that guys that's huge massive right so guys what can we do with javascript right we can do a bunch of things we can build web apps which you guys have seen in our amazing live builds hope you guys are enjoying those by the way you can build some native apps so not by learning something like react you can actually go ahead and build ios android apps which is amazingly powerful and you can actually go ahead and then take it further and have server apps using node.js so that is a backend technology that we're talking about um but yeah pretty much with one language javascript you can go ahead and do all of this stuff so amazing now let's get into the technical nittygritty guys nice we just threw that in there because we love sonny's british accent so when he says we love that we all love that drop a like for that accent now what's going on so here guys when it comes to this you got to learn the basics okay with html make a page make it work don't over complicate it so that's just the basic foundation right yeah keep it simple just get html up and running on your page and literally that just means like get some stuff on a page and that's it move and then move to start moving forward like don't over complicate it don't start thinking all these other things just get moving with it and then move over to css so css is cascading stylesheet and that's on the next slide and here guys you want to learn how to use different layouts so how do you position things on the page in different ways and for that you can learn flexbox and flexbox is going to help you achieve a really nice responsive design and then you compare that with media queries to get things working just as you want it on like mobile tablet and everything like that so something to look into uh it's definitely a massive fundamental here css yup 100 learn that now with javascript you guys got to make sure you master the fundamentals learn the basics learn them inside out learn problem solving learn things like data types learn things like functions and es6 versus es7 so for example what is that arrow looking thing right that's more es6 es7 as in before there would just be regular functions so learn those things because those are very common at every job you'll need to know them learn about dom manipulation learn about scopes and fetch api and learn a lot about asynchronous programming lolo thank you so much for another donation and he says what's the statistics on degree and no degree jobs i think at this point guys if you have the skills down it doesn't matter whether you have the degree or no degree there are tons of developers working at facebook at microsoft at google at netflix who don't have degrees and are making upwards of 200 or even 300 000 a year yeah even elon musk just said that he pretty much ruled out the need for a degree now so yeah official companies are rolling out yeah yeah so that's huge so now what about the visual design stuff guys that's so important so let's jump straight into that actually so let's talk about some of the visual design stuff that we think is actually super important we'll start from the start yeah so there are five key principles of good design and suddenly you want to talk about some of them yeah so guys the first one is visual hierarchy so this is all about oh and one one thing actually just before we go into it uh guys this slide these slides were made by somebody on the team alex who's actually the newest addition to our team at clever programmer and he is phenomenal extremely talented uh kid he's only 19 years old and he had amazing resources on the front end side and so we're like hey why don't you put together some slides so we can share it so is that okay if we share these with you guys i think he would be really pumped and i think hopefully you guys will get a lot of value out of this too yeah and also guys let's drop alex a massive welcome in the comment section welcome to this team nice that's actually brilliant and drop a like for alex yeah drop a like nice so the first point guys first key principle of design a visual hierarchy so this is all about how do you rank elements on your page so here we have like a banner we have a header at the top and the sort of size and scale of these components they all play a different purpose like so for example we're always drawn to banners when we see like a website so they play a really important part it's really an important part of being a frontend developer yep and i just want to say guys we broke 700 live concurrent viewers so thank you guys so much that is insane appreciate you now visual hierarchy is very important and what's another thing that's super important right after visual hierarchy is actually the typography how things are written so if you take a look at how it you know slack replaces email inside your company that text matters it's bold and like it's kind of powerful you see it the size of it matters the styling of it matters and so typography is something you kind of have to know and if you look on the left hand side it says the style of fonts you use in your design can really impact your visual composition you can either help a message stand out with heavier weighted fonts or bring characters closer together to help the message feel more pronounced and i think when we see how it says try slack see the demo when we see where it says keep conversations organized in slack when you see slack replaces email how all of those are together and how typography is used it's very powerful yeah definitely definitely so typography super important guys and the next one is color so as you can see from this webpage immediately that thing just looks gorgeous like as soon as you see it it just grabs your eyes it grabs your full focus that's going to make all the difference guys now color is not just as simple as picking a color right you need to have like how do you figure out which colors to use how do you figure out which color palettes so on the next side we have a really handy tool that we actually used internally and it's called i don't know how you pronounce it i think it's coolers.com right rulers.co yeah yeah and cause you've used this right this is awesome you guys this is one tool that i think all designers should use and as a matter of fact i think i'm just going to open and go ahead and show it on the computer and how you use it but this thing is super powerful logan is here he goes my boy's dropping the value bomb let's go i mean you already know bro it's every day bro like the jake paul song he's actually there uh fbi just raided his house yesterday so let's go start the generator over here and this thing is awesome for colors i am not a frontend developer but even i was using this and this is awesome so check it out right if you want to pick a color that's good you can just click and how does it do that random generation again don't i think it's yeah so look i'm just pressing space bar and it's giving me these different colors and color palettes and so i'll keep going until i actually find something that kind of speaks out to me and um i want to use so let's even if you find the color you can lock that color and then you can keep you can keep sharpening so i like this orange because that's kind of like the clever programmer orange so now i can actually just do i can click it and it just locked it okay i could have also done command three command two will lock this one the second one so i'll just do command three and lock it now i just hit space bar and that orange will stay locked in but i've picked it now maybe i want something really sharp and crazy uh i like purples a lot so i'll lock this one too so now i have two of my colors and color palette picked and if i keep going you know this is you guys can see how this can be super useful for your website design logo design uh brand that you're trying to create whatever it may be yeah really really handy tool guys and it's really handy when you're just starting out in your sort of frontend journey because it's hard to figure out these things like the colors that you should use and stuff so definitely go ahead and check that out yep so coolers dot co is a great resource now what do we have uh here on this one sunny right so here we have contrast guys so you can see like so we talked about colors but look how they use the colors right look how they're contrasting different colors together and how it draws your attention to each of those three different uh items on the screen so contrast is something which could is really really important and how to know which colors that complement one another so in in that case you i think coolest does that by default so you notice whenever we're going through our palette it kind of with colors that was just seem naturally to fit together so use tools like that to sort of get a grasp of contrast but super important yeah and hari krishan just donated four dollars so thank you so much for that really really appreciate you that is freaking awesome good thank you and there's a good comment that came in from david breck and he actually says coolers is the best i used it for my final project last semester and it was looking really nice awesome awesome nice okay so let's move forward with this so number five grid systems these are really important now you guys hear us talking about grid systems in material ui or not just material ui but regular css we talked about grid and then even with bootstrap we talked about grid a lot and it's an important thing when you're designing you know even when you think about photo composition right you're thinking about rules of third rules of third is a grid system essentially so here for your own website design i think a grid system is important you want to add something on the grid system sony yeah so massive power here guys even for achieving responsive designs using a grid system allows you to actually really easily achieve that that sort of design that you're looking for so i know we talk a lot about flexbox but if you go ahead and master something like css grid achieving a responsive design is actually super super uh it's like it's very easy to do that with css grid so definitely something worth uh investing your time in and learning together lira fernandez says sunny plus cause the ultimate duo thank you and resvan says love your guys's content appreciate it brother so thank you next up now with gr i think grid systems is all important but like what kind of tools can you guys use to actually prototype grid systems and prototype and come up with design ideas for your website before you start coding it up so this is why we put this slide together for you guys tools for prototyping and um go ahead yeah just gonna say just how we say guys before you even write a line of code you should kind of like get an idea write it down on a piece of paper what you're trying to do right we do the same thing with design like with sketch with envision with adobe xd and and figma um pretty much you you that's what you go ahead and do you draw it out as you want to achieve your website they provide tools which allow you to go ahead and easily sort the layout without any code or anything and then you have something to work towards so this is this is adobe xd this is indesign uh this is envision envision got it this is figma over here and then this one is sketch yep yeah so design it first you guys before sometimes you just start creating though like oftentimes i personally kind of just jump into it but also i'm not a professional front end designer you know our front end developer so i think if you use these tools you make your uh development a lot better definitely definitely now here are some adobe xd resources so there's some go ahead you want to talk about it yeah so we have app integration guys slack jira um i can't remember what the last one was that well that's nice so you when you're designing you can actually just shoot it to your team in slack yeah and i actually worked in a company where they did this every time a design was updated it would ping in slack and i'd get the latest design really really handy stuff even ui kits guys so like all the apple designs all the microsoft designs all those things are built into these platforms so you can go ahead and get the apple layout as you just expect it uh um so alex actually went ahead and told me about one of the plugins for example if you want to have confetti on the screen or confetti on your design sometimes that can be quite hard to actually go ahead and add to your designs so there's little handy plugins that you can go ahead and install so just a quick showcase of the thing you can nice yep and then apparently it has a plugin of air table and plug in a react so that's also sounds pretty handy and then it got ui kits for apple if you're developing for them or microsoft so this is awesome now also i think what's important that alex was telling me too it goes you got to have inspiration resources so where can you go and get inspiration from because one thing i see with frontend developers and why they sometimes they have good intentions but it end up ends up being bad because they're coming up with everything uniquely on their own and sometimes that's why your design will be bad so have inspirations to derive from so then you can actually create something really powerful and good yeah steve mccarthy says my front ends look like 1990s web pages i think every developer can relate to you on that and that's why we use the sort of things that we're about to speak about nice got it this is that's actually really small um that's funny because my stuff looks like that too and here is mostly search which is pinterest for designers have you ever used the sunny so i'm not using muesli i've used the one that we're going to speak about next but i definitely when alex mentioned this i'm going to check this one out sure yeah yep so this is like pinterest for designers and you guys can actually type in whatever keywords that you're looking for right and then inspirations will pop up and i think they have like landing pages and all that type of stuff for you to get inspiration from so i would definitely make mosley search one of your guys's resources for front end design and even sunny and i will personally add it to our toolbox yeah like guys they have like three and a half thousand dashboards ten thousand landing pages mobile app designs even if you have a rough idea of what your app should look like there's no harm in going and checking out a bunch of designs to see what could be improved you know yep 100 and guys i think we just broke 900 concurrent viewers so thank you guys so much that is massive appreciate the love guys let's keep that energy up and let's keep getting this video out to even more people and you can just do that if you're here and you haven't liked the video already go ahead and just like the video and then it sends it out to more developers and more people who want to become developers thank you guys awesome thank you so here we have so the chrome extension for mosley is available too so you guys can just download it i believe for free and install it on chrome so you can do that it's called muesli to stay inspired and it has over 300 000 plus active users yeah really handy now let's jump into some design resources so sunny take it away the first one that we have here guys is a design blog by adobe so it's completely free to go ahead and read this subscribe to it and what we always do is we actually recommend this with javascript so there's a few javascript newsletters and that's what i personally use to stay at the front of the javascript and what's latest and what's going on so this is the exact same thing but for design and as a frontend developer super important guys it's going to teach you the latest processes the latest principles and also what the latest companies are doing in regards to design right so really really important to stay up to like in front of the in front of the crowd when it comes to this stuff like the type of stuff that i'm looking at right now that seems actually pretty powerful to me i mean that stuff's just catching my eyes unique insights so for example i want to know about interviews and how did they interview people based on design how did somebody pass the interview based on that i think that seems pretty amazing for somebody who's looking for a job yep definitely here are some great free design resources you guys and so if you have any um you want to add anything sunny feel free to jump in at any time but yeah so we have behance and dribble for those yeah i'm just going gonna say behance is one i gotta put in my uh repertoire as well but behance is absolutely amazing you guys so make sure you guys add that as one of your resources and then the next one is actually dribble dribble is amazing let me actually just open up because i have some experience with dribble and these guys are is triple with three b's it's three b's yeah three b's yeah there we go so it's dribble with three b's and you guys can go here and get inspirations for what you're trying to build so maybe let's say you're trying to build like that uh bottom nav bar or whatever on your mobile device and you can actually take a look at this inspiration right here or if you're trying to build a landing page you can take a look at this design yeah that somebody built you go oh that actually looks really great let me actually model this so if you look at the top and what i would honestly do is i would go to this platform and let's see if i can go in filters cool popular maybe you can go click web design right and go to the most popular web designs that you can see so say this one then just try to design this exact thing that looks exactly like that and put it in your portfolio see what i'm saying that will guaranteed work because it's already popping on the design website yeah one of the most popular ones the best thing is is that these are going to be less popular than the sort of typical sort of projects that you're going to see in everyone's portfolio so if you go here you're going to be sure that you have some pieces which stand out inside your portfolio and they're really attractive really look beautiful and it's also going to make you a better frontend developer so no harm in doing it yeah no harm in doing this like this is another one and i think that's a really good point that sunny made because sometimes if everybody is making clones of things sometimes your those people will be like well you probably just follow the tutorial you know to do this or you just follow the todo list tutorial but here it's not everybody's doing it so this will also make you stand out if you try to exactly model these pages yeah that will be a really good test for you guys so let's go back to the keynote that we had for you guys and i think i mean damn we're almost at a thousand total viewers on all platforms so that is amazing unbelievable unbelievable thank you guys so these are free resources and then you might be wondering like how can i improve my visual design skills and this is something we just touched on a little bit already so make sure you discover creative work on these platforms i think inspiration is probably going to be one of the most important things and then you know what the next most important thing is even within inspiration right you want to find few people and then model them so tell me your thoughts on this one sonny i think this is a really important point i never thought of this until alex explained it to me so like go ahead and find some designers and follow them because like he mentioned to me it's all about pattern recognition if you start to see and you follow their designs you're going to see where they go from like a rounded design to a flat design and if you're following three people and all of them are moving in that direction you can you can be sure that the industry might be switching to that direction and it's like a queue to then learn that stuff and go a bit more deeper into it just like how you follow me follow kazee nars in the javascript domain it's just as important in like visual design domain that you go ahead and follow someone so these are people on dribble and alex recommended that you guys go and follow these so definitely go and check him out um and he's an amazing designer and he actually goes and follows these people as well so be sure to go it's super killer because even one of the things that i learned when i'm looking for homes is we couldn't find a lot of good listings so what we did is we found the owner of a home that was like nice and we hit up the owner and the owner just showed us all other homes that were similarly amazingly designed oh nice you know what i'm saying so i think with when you're looking for website designs just follow a few people and then you can actually start to develop that same eye as them and you will guaranteed almost always find good principle designs because you're following the right people definitely and the next one is sunny what is this go ahead and build some app clones guys so if you haven't already we have actually gone ahead and built all of the clones on the screen right now so which is amazing to say that really nice yeah you guys so nice to look at it yeah it's really nice you guys can go ahead and build those and go and check them out and that's going to help you become a better frontend developer and it's going to help you improve your skill set so seriously and it's going to it's going to be something you add to your portfolio so definitely go ahead and check those because we built netflix we built tinder clone just a few days ago we built spotify cloned we built ticktock clone and instagram clone so these are all websites that we built and the front end for them so what better than to have these on your portfolio exactly awesome so with that said we're gonna jump back into this pretty much uh right away thank you for the donation basil straight back into oh thank you basil islam nice and you guys we're about to hit a thousand concurrent viewers on youtube very soon we're at 971 you guys are absolutely freaking beautiful daniel sulliada says awesome stream guys i believe most web developers are not great designers would it be beneficial for a web dev to learn ui ux design and what we will say is absolutely i think it's one of the key components you could have hidden in your back pocket you come in as a full stack developer or backend developer and then you just blow their minds with your design skills yeah it's what takes you from a junior frontend developer to a senior frontend developer having that difference in that visual skill yeah yep so i think it's absolutely killer guys thank you so much drop a like for the video if you're here and you've been enjoying this content let's keep sending it out to more and more people let's break that thousand mark and with that said let's continue with the value bombs so watching base now onto the back to the technical stuff guys so back to the technical nigrate what the hell is a framework guys we always are asking like which framework do i learn is it like angular view react javascript's always evolving it's always changing so how do you know which one which framework to start on and kazi like when you first entered this domain what was your thoughts on that i was very confused with all especially the web development it was just like i'm like let me just do python because python was just python and then web development was like view react angular this that that other thing and i'm like that seems like too much is going on yeah exactly there's a lot going on so we're gonna we're here to clear that up for you today guys on what you should focus all of your attention on so here are the most popular go ahead the most popular ones that we're going to cover guys are the first one you've probably heard of this angular it's google's uh framework right so you have google's framework it's very popular it grew quite a lot but it's sort of on the downward trend right now and then they had a view um i'm not actually sure because you know who actually came up with the view i'm not entirely sure i don't know who came out with you very lightweight uh library extremely sort of popular it's very opinionated um but it sort of surpassed angular and then the guys at facebook just came along and just like blew everyone's mind with like react like they came along i love this and they just took it to a whole new level you know like they um have we have have we gone to the next slide we're on react oh nice yeah awesome yeah so yeah this one guys this is by the guys over at facebook and this is obviously if you're not if you're new to the channel go ahead and check out the last few videos and we'll clear up what react is uh yeah so yeah massive companies are using all three of these right now guys so you've got airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox using react you've got guardian upwork paypal sony using angular and then you've got alibaba and a bunch of others using vue but how do you know which one to choose from these so like what would you look at when you were when you would make this decision that's really important i honestly a few things i always look at which is why i looked at python as well i look for simplicity and ease of use i almost put that above so many other things just because i want to know how what's the learning curve can i pick it up fast and then i also look at how long is this thing here to stay so like is it popular is it picked up by a lot of people and then of course i want to look at like what companies you know are using it so when i see like i look at the guardian and i'm like that's cool but airbnb is like more badass you know like upwork is cute but instagram is really where it's at yeah exactly yeah so i mean i think all of them are being used by popular but i strive for simplicity and um something that's just you know popular and trending right now exactly so with that said guys we went ahead and checked out stack overflow and wanted to see what the most wanted framework was and you guys guessed it right whoa we just broke 1 000 viewers concurrent we're over 1 000 viewers on youtube you guys are absolutely amazing thank you so much thank you guys damn that is amazing let's keep it rolling so go ahead thank you guys so the number one most wanted framework right now is flying with react right so yeah at the top you've got react so guys there is no downfall right now to learn and react react is here to stay you can be sure for the next five years if you learn react you're gonna have a job but you're gonna have some kind of income that will come from that so definitely worth investing your time yep and it's the most wanted framework now if we go over here you guys can see react is just flying off and this is actually like look this is the real download so this is not just some popularity this is literally download so take a look at this versus angular versus view and honestly a lot of the reason with angular is because it's too um it's it forces you into a framework and it forces you to code a certain way whereas with react it's not a framework it's just a library it's super lightweight so it's plug and play and then it's also a badass and you know you it's pretty much just like javascript under the hood yeah so next time you guys have that question should i learn angular should i learn view think about this like visual right here like angular is going off react is going off the chart oh there we go okay this visual right here okay i think you were talking about this visual because i'm like that other visual makes me not wanna you know if you guys loved it drop a thumbs up warrior warrior says this is insane you guys are lit we're always lit somebody also said this is like watching two friends just kind of give us advice so that's cool yeah i love that it is guys there's two friends just giving you guys advice amazing so what what is this over here right so yeah so we talked about react so we're gonna dive a bit more into react guys so react is all about component based design and what that means guys is literally you go ahead and break a website down into different components the header the navbar the body the text and all that goes in like the cards on amazon all of those things and you basically just reuse them right so it's literally like once you get the hang of that the reason why it's really really relates it guys it's actually super simple it's actually really easy to go ahead and reuse components so getting your head around the component based design is crucial now managing data and react like how does this work so when it comes to managing data and redux this is where people start to kind of lose their and start going crazy and this is why in our clones that we make like amazon clone where we use context api where we start to introduce the idea of redux and we built another tutorial i think with spotify where we use context api so this is another concept which introduces things like data layers and you needing to understand that which is super powerful and super valuable once you learn it and the stepbystep process of learning is learn context api first and then get into redux and is the easiest way to do it send me your thoughts on this exactly what cause you said pretty much so guys well the minute the minute you kind of hear about redux and you look at tutorials for redux this is your reaction it's pretty much like oh my god like it's kind of freaking me out and stuff so all we're going to say here is pretty much like kazi said go ahead learn the react context api first learn that pattern and then picking out redux is kind of easy so it's gonna it's gonna be a lot simpler than as if you were just jumping straight into redux for the first time so the next one yeah react context api it's going to be a lot easier to learn and pick up um and if you are interested in the builds that we've done we actually went ahead and done that so you can definitely use those as reference yep and you you know we have a free training for you guys profit with javascript free training so you guys can go ahead and sign up for it at any time we have a webinar that we've put together it's a one hour free webinar it's in the description below so if you guys want to go ahead and check that out definitely go ahead and sign up for it because it just gives you the exact road map to you know here we're diving deep into the front end developer guide in your roadmap in that one we're talking about how are you going to go from your zero dollars to making a hundred thousand dollars whether you do that in one year three years or five years it's really the road map to learning the coding skills and the practicality of your first hundred thousand dollars so i put that in the description below click that link and then sign up for that training it's freaking awesome definitely go check that out guys free value so definitely worth checking out now i included this one because i have a lot of people who do ask about something called mob x right i had a question about it before uh it says basically another uh opinionated version of like managing data within a react app honestly my my viewpoint here is if anyone has this question go ahead and use react context api and then redux if you want to do this it's just kind of a cool thing to learn but honestly if you want to land a job redux is the way to go got it and now check out the live bills that we have free on youtube all right so bruce buffer is endorsing us apparently and over here you can see we got the zoom clone i mean i know it's really hard for you guys to see but we got the zoom clone that we made recently we made a spotify clone for you guys we made the tick tock clone uh that's at you know in six days we have over 117 000 people watched that one and a lot of them built it out we built a youtube clone for you guys you can see the exact frontend design for youtube and then we also did the tinder clone and then a bunch of more stuff so go ahead and guys like that's all there for free on youtube so make sure you get value from that as well exactly and guys if you were if you've watched any of these and you found value from that just all we ask is you smash the thumbs up button and that's enough for us to break break the thumbs up button exactly now okay so what's this what am i looking at all right so next guys we have design libraries so what are design libraries they help us achieve that clean ui they help us to achieve things like that grid system that we spoke about earlier so here are two popular ones one's called material ui ones called bootstrap now they give us things like icon sets so we can use like we've used it in a lot of our builds so like having those clean flat buttons which have the responsive click and that google sort of ripple effect and also that responsive design both material ui and bootstrap are going to help you achieve that now we spoke about react both of them are very very heavily supported with react they have a react bootstrap and material ui out by default supports react so definitely worth something looking into guys yep awesome so now we have node and npm so now let's talk about what is node and what is npm is it on the next slides or do we got to talk about it now uh no it's on here so node guys in case you're wondering because i know it can be confusing when you see javascript and node.js you're like oh i mean aren't they the same thing right so we talked about earlier frontend development is in javascript whenever you have any backend software any any code which sits on the server somewhere that's node.js so that's like living on a server somewhere and it runs in something called node.js now mpm is how you pull in essentially other packages and other modules into your code so if you're going to use material ui or bootstrap you would use npm now npm stands for node package manager and it basically whenever you write a piece of code that you want to share with others you store it on the node registry and then other people can go ahead and pull it so definitely what we do use that in everything 100 now over here we got npm and we got yarn and oftentimes people say how do i choose so how do you choose sunny right so this is very sort of opinionated uh yarn is quite a powerful one to use it's very clean actually and i used to be a firm believer in sticking with mpm but i would actually go ahead and use yarn but guys whatever you decide to use just stick to the one like then you can learn both there's no harm at all um but don't have your project and sometimes you do npm sometimes you do yarn just stick to one and that's going to be um you're sort of clear enough and and guys if you're going to a job and they're using yarn carry on using yarn if you're going to a job they're using npm karen using npm it's really not a big decision and it's not as scary as everyone thinks yep travel todd says travel tools says i was zero in react i watched all the clones now i know react context api and he says sunny's way of teaching is the best on youtube i love that thank you so much travel tools so go watch those yeah definitely go ahead and check those out love that now what is firebase and why is it so useful for a frontend developer now guys what's beautiful about firebase this thing is going to blow your mind is you actually don't even need a backend like node you can actually do realtime database you can do user authentication you can do um pretty much everything you could do with the normal data including hosting your website you can do all of that with firebase yeah massive value here guys so firebase is provided by google a bunch of different tools are included in firebase and literally what kazi said is what they do so it's pretty much they wanted to alleviate and get rid of that headache with the back end and sort of you they just want you to focus on your frontend developer they want you to make beautiful apps and make it simple for you to deploy them host them handle authentication and all that stuff so we're going to run through some of the things that firebase offer which can help you as a frontend developer yep so firebase can do hosting and it also allows you to think 100 million users and you guys should also think about 100 million users always so when your app has 100 million users can it handle it and with firebase the answer is yes it can actually handle it and it do it automatically for you exactly scales up scales down just by itself so very simple to go ahead and do that we also have the cloud of uh we have the realtime firestore database so guys this is amazing like power behind this and i don't think anyone realizes until you actually go ahead and play with it without doing any backend stuff you get a realtime database so like literally if you've got messages coming through you don't have to do any magic behind that it will just come through inside on your front end with very minimal code like literally three lines of code and you can have something coming through so extreme power at the realtime database and what's up with this yeah so here guys a lot of you guys are asking about machine learning can we do it can we do it or like do we need python if you guys are interested in machine learning you can combine something called tensorflow.js which is a way of uh training models in machine learning with the uh with firebase and you can actually have really really powerful machine learning uh functionality with jacked front end developer yeah like all of this is like crazy guys like you can do all of this very simply and on the next slide there's a little diagram showing you about how we can train a model and then we can serve it using firebase so really powerful stuff the training is taking place here right and then serving is all happening with firebase and firebase is all front end like what what is happening what is life so that's the beautiful thing so even if you don't understand machine learning you're sitting you're going what am i looking at doesn't matter like the whole idea is that with firebase it's possible so even if you learned it later you could do it just to tell you how far you can push it with this authentication dude check this out marouche says sunny and kazi i got promoted yesterday because of learning react from your tinder clone many things it's amazing well done dude we love that we helped you out that's amazing uh let me actually see this um that's awesome yeah i got maroosa sunny and yeah i got promoted that's awesome thank you so much dude i'm i'm pumped for you that's huge we got frank in the house paton says wow this guy is coding in 2021 you know us we're in the future we'll wait for everybody else to catch up guys we're all in the future everybody who's here it's the culture we're freaking driven we're grateful we're all pumped that's the culture that we're building in the team and i feel like that's what we have even in the community exactly on the user authentication side guys i imagine as a frontend developer you can actually add google authentication facebook authentication twitter authentication github regular email or even with the phone like all of this you guys can add with firebase and it's super simple to be able to do that with firebase yeah as a full stack developer guys i can tell you at first hand doing that is not a simple task but firebase make it extremely simple to do user authentication so save yourself the hassle use firebase when you're doing it exactly and thank you frankie for removing those messages because i was about to do that guys keep the chat positive otherwise you're going to get blocked we want the culture to be just filled with positive and amazing people so let's keep the positivity going we read all of your comments if you want to be a part of this community bring positivity bring love and those are the people that are more than welcome here cloud functions with firebase i mean you can actually do this from front end and this essentially allows you to be able to do all the backend functionality you could ever dream of cloud functions allow you to do that and they allow you to do it kind of from the front end so that's a really beautiful thing anything else you want to touch base on with this before we move forward um just really powerful basically if you ever need some backend functionality guys don't go ahead and start up an express server or something like that your your answer would be in cloud functions in case anyone was wondering that so definitely go ahead and learn those if you're interested in doing some kind of back end with your front end yup uh here is an amazing uh comment from the good gamer and he says i got a job as a developer thanks qazi i've not done any tutorials but i followed your other videos and django course damn amazing nice that is amazing man pumped to hear that well done so let's go here now now storage firebase also allows you to do all the storage so when you're storing media when you want your media to be optimized and served in the fastest way possible firebase handles that when you want to have a database and you want to store things videos anything like that firebase can handle that for you as well yeah exactly they do google on it they do a bunch of analytics and test lab stuff so analytics keeping track of your users who's doing what on your on your platform is massively useful and insightful especially as your business grows firebase test lab guys if you build an app firebase test lab literally will check that app across so many different physical devices and it will show you screenshots of how the app looks on every single one of those devices automatically which is insane like that's really really insane really powerful especially when you're sort of you want your app to work on everyone's device and be universal so really really powerful stuff super powerful henrik says do you have a tutorial using firebase almost every single one of our clones that we built on our youtube channel over the last few weeks you guys can go and watch them tick tock instagram um facebook messenger clone tinder clone netflix clone all of them pretty much are using firebase so you can watch them they're amazing tutorials on how to use firebase yep exactly it allows you to grow your business it allows you a b testing cloud messaging inapp messaging all that good stuff comes with firebase built in now what's the best part about firebase do you guys want to know exactly well let's go for it and what is that sonny guys it's free it's fast and it's easy to use free to a limit guys so all the use cases which you guys are probably going to be using it for completely free so you guys can go ahead even deploying your apps guys it will give you a really beautiful little url which is actually completely fine to keep that url as your primary url and you can pretty much host it forever for free so definitely and it's the easiest hosting solution i've ever seen when it comes to a web app so definitely worth going ahead and doing that agreed now let's move on into which code editor should i use because we've talked about firebase and i think firebase is phenomenal and hopefully you guys love that too but i think one thing a lot of people want to know is what code editor should i use so here we got you know that code editor war should i use webstorm should i use visual studio code sublime or adam what do you recommend sunny so i was actually i've kind of gone through a bunch of these i use sublime at one point i use atom but now my by far guys just for the simplicity of how you add on extensions and sort of the the growth of it uh vs code guys vs code is so powerful it's ridiculous like i would really really recommend and we're going to run through some of the stuff as to some of the reasons as to why we're firm believers that it's definitely the best code for you guys yep and here now we're going to jump into also the extensions that are actually the most powerful for vs code i think one extension alone makes it that you can't go and look anywhere else the one extension that comes to my mind is called live share this alone makes me feel like you can never use anything like adam is just like it seems like it's from 1930s now uh yeah so does every other editor that i could dream of the live share means sunny and i can code remotely he's in london i'm in us on the same freaking code editor and it feels like your local host it's not screen share it's not team viewer it's literally the same exact thing so he's seeing it in perfect resolution he has access to my command line my localhost 3000 and even when my browser localhost 3000 is up he can actually view the website and everything exactly guys it's so powerful and just for that one extension alone it's worth downloading and just giving it a try so really really powerful stuff we've got a few others which are not worth mentioning we've got prettier so a lot of us hate doing that indentation we hate adding spaces how many stuff is very opinionated so like we just want it so when you hit save it just formats all your code and keeps it concise pretty it does that for you really really handy stuff um any others worth mentioning here qazi the other ones that i think are worth mentioning here i like brackets a lot so in javascript and react and all this one thing that was annoying to me as a python user is like oh my god so many freaking squiggly brackets and parentheses and it's insane and then semicolons and you miss one of those and your code just doesn't work and it's hard to see it's hard to visualize so what this does is it gives you matching brackets so you guys see how this red one over here closes this red one right over there right and then the yellow one closes the yellow one so each bracket having its own color is very very useful because you know where easily it opens where it closes and you never will have that problem again another extension that's important to mention is this snippets one where for react it's super important where you can just do rfce and boom it just makes a component for you i think that's pretty damn handy but in terms of the usefulness of it like i think you know all of these are pretty important the ones we use the most is prettier i think another one that gets used a lot if you're doing remote programming is live share and then i would say uh the snippets and then the brackets yeah exactly so on the next side we touch base on pretty much what we spoke about the lentis and formats that you need are prettier eslint and es7 snippets in my opinion they are really really something which is going to dial you in and make you much faster of what you do also one that we haven't put on here guys i think it's built into vs code by default it's called emit emit is really powerful guys it's how we you'll see when i'm coding sometimes i'll just write div dot and then i'll have some stuff on there and it's very very powerful in in order to write html very fast so definitely worth checking out cool so these are your linters right eslant prettier and es7 snippets so you guys can use these these are good for linting and formatting and what that means is some of them will check your code so i think prettier will format your code and make it look pretty lint will tell you like you know this looks wrong uh you're using the wrong type of pattern here or like it'll like highlight hey you shouldn't use this many characters in one line things like that right sonny yeah do you know where the lin came from the name i didn't know this until like literally about a week ago you know those linters that you put on your clothing oh i didn't know that yeah so it's like picking up the the the fluff of your code that's why it's called yes lint do you know where it's debugging do you know where debugging came from yeah they found a fly right in the massive in one of the first computers or something yeah they would get flies or cockroaches and things like that in the physical computer so they would debug by taking them out they would take out the bugs from the computer i love that i don't know i think frankie or somebody told me that yeah vs code live share important extension pair programming this is how sunny and i usually program exactly the blonde one is me especially when it comes to react that's so funny all right guys how do you but like with all this said like how do you go ahead and learn like how do you what's our advice to you guys if you're new to this journey like how do you go ahead and learn um so we've got a few things on the slides coming up so we've got uh we've got youtube so we've got youtube and from youtube we're talking about our tutorials completely free guys you can go ahead and check them out we've also got um we also recommend that you go ahead and join a community guys so whether it be facebook whether it be linkedin whether you're recording your journey on instagram or whether it be discord or even slack so like uh we actually have our internal slack community which we go ahead and recommend definitely something worth checking out what's your thoughts on that yeah i think this community is super important you know this is why in profit with javascript we just developed a curated community of people you know uh profitable javascript is our paid coaching uh paid program for javascript where we teach you these skills but really the community like you kind of come for the course but you stay for the people you know you stay for the community and so we've got over 1300 members and they're just so freaking amazing and dialed in but guys it doesn't matter whether you join our community or somebody else's just make sure you're part of some community i think it's important it helps you keep moving forward and it keeps you accountable and yeah the people matter yeah so join a community and um should we talk about profit with javascript right now or i think we can talk about a little bit later yeah we took my eye after yeah okay so guys something yeah go for it so what is tutorial hell sonny you can talk about this actually yeah so guys what we find is like a lot of people what they do is they tend to sort of follow tutorials that they see whether it be on youtube or like a stack overflow tutorial and then what they'll do is they'll copy it line by line and what you'll end up with is like you'll finish 10 projects for example but you basically like you haven't really learned anything you just have 10 cool projects that you can show but if i was to go in and change something or break something you wouldn't be able to tell me like how to fix it or something like that and then we call that tutorial hub because if you feel like you're doing all these tutorials but you're just not learning anything right so my best advice in this case is don't uh whenever you do that either one extend onto what you've built so if you build a youtube clone add some functionality to the youtube clone so that it then goes further than what was taught inside of that uh any any other tips on how to get out of tutorial i think just build real projects you guys like dribble built for like for example if you're front end developer look at what's on dribble build that uh look at what inspires you build it um don't get stuck in tutorial help move on and actually start doing useful stuff with what you learned now when it comes to fundamentals master them okay yeah master them guys and the reason why we added this slide is because it really is a it's a huge step and it's going to be the difference between you moving very fast and you're moving extremely slow like go ahead break down the fundamentals and use things like w3 schools w3 schools is amazing i love this by the way i just wanted to throw this in here epic epic zeus says you guys are like assassin's creed forming a brotherhood of nextgen programmers we work in the dark to serve the light hey love that nice awesome coin by epic that's a cool name as well it exists yeah that is a pretty dope name yeah nice okay so yeah guys mastering the fundamentals and what is one of those i love this game that is the funniest thing i've ever seen oh my god so one of the fundamentals guys is get and github and you guys have to learn that and for those of you who know about git merge nobody ever wants to see it happen it's not fun yeah but you got to learn it i think it is very very important a lot of people are saying lag but i think we're going to keep going until it just ends yeah i think it's i think it's cleared up now yeah we're good yep so why you need need to know git and github why is this important sonny i don't care about it i don't need to know about it right you know i can just become a developer without it that's what i for dude but every single professional job that you go in any team environment where you've got more than one developer they don't work together by sharing the files right they work together with git right you need to know get if you're going to be a professional web developer whether it be uh freelancing and you're jumping into a team of a team of sort of developers or you're going into a permanent position you need to know gear and you because what happens is they store their code on something called a repository and then basically you need to learn how to push code to that repository pull code from so if another developer's done some work you can pull that in all of those things are covered with git right now the most popular platform that users get is github you've also got git labs and a few others but i really recommend getting familiar with github it's the most popular it's owned by microsoft now and it's here to stay so it's definitely getting more powerful definitely worth investing your time in that yeah and remember guys one thing i think that's confusing git is not github yeah a lot of people get that uh confusion github is like dropbox for code github is like google drive for code that's github is just like a place where you put your code that's it so git hub is not that important to learn like it doesn't matter if you use github or if you use bitbucket that's not that git you must learn git this is version control this is the time machine for your code if you mess something up you can go back in time so exactly pretty good time machine yeah it's like and also guys it can be scary i know when you're trying to learn github with the terminal so if you guys are experiencing that sort of fear or you're like oh i don't want to touch anything because i'm freaking out and i'm going to break something then something i recommend is something called get kraken which is actually a really nice interface for gear and you can pretty much drag and drop your branches and do all your stuff very visually so if you are afraid of it go ahead and check out get cracking really handy uh gui for uh for handling get yeah yeah i think that's important i'm sometimes mentioned that too so awesome so let's go back uh yeah henrik when he watched that part but git is not github he asked earlier like what's the difference between them and then he's like oh that's yup that's for me so guys just to kind of recap you know we touched on a lot of things and we still have a bunch of things to go but we talked about frameworks right and why react is the framework that you should actually pick uh we're going to talk we talked about that html and javascript is what you need to know to become a developer you know frontend developer and we've touched on other things like you know which code editor you should use but we still have some other things we're gonna touch on moving forward okay so just stay buckled in we're gonna keep going and if you're here and you're enjoying this make sure to like the video so it goes out to other people please it helps us definitely please do that all right cool now what is a pre processor now all right go ahead go for it yeah so a preprocessor guys is pretty much it's it applies to css so we talked about the three fundamentals html css javascript but we're talking about preprocessors all about css right and what it does basically is it's kind of like think of it simply as an upgrade to your css right so with sas they introduced um so on the next side we've got three really uh really popular ones we've got sas post css and less right they're quite opinionated you can use whatever one you prefer sas was quite a popular one that i saw and it basically introduced something called uh like variables into your into your css which was really really powerful guys and it also allowed you to do nesting and a bunch of other stuff so it basically made it more maintainable to go ahead and use um css i think post css and css modules also prevents one of those common problems that we run into where for example in react you you developing components right so if you have two different files and you have the same class name in each of those files you can have like overriding rules without realizing by using these libraries it actually goes ahead and adds an additional class name to it so you never get that issue so even if you had the same class names it wouldn't actually clash so really important things here very subtle but very important if you want to become that next level developer yep awesome all right so let's move to the next one styled components so what are these sunny so this is in react we use start components i really i'm a big fan of style components i think we'll actually go ahead and include this in the next build um basically in react you have something called props and it's very difficult sometimes to have like how do you use your variables so like your javascript variables with css for example if you want to if you've got like a variable which is true or false how do you apply that with your css style components is your answer it allows you to very simply go ahead and do that and you can pretty much basically go ahead and use your props in a component and and and conditionally render your style based on those and those variables so really really powerful stuff uh yeah really really and it's here to stay guys a lot of big companies use it yeah beautiful we just got another super chat by dpunk thank you for that thank you really appreciate it we're over 21 in super chat so thank you guys all right now steve says much less useful now we have css variables natively really good point actually yeah so that's the reason why sas is being less used now i'm also going to talk about sas is being less used oh yeah yeah so like because we have css variables natively now it's actually not as needed as it used to be and it's quite there's quite a few issues with it but we're going to talk about a few things which actually helps you alleviate the the problems that you use you experience with sas so one of them is css modules which we spoke about if you have two files with the same class names this is going to help you avoid that problem and the next one is sas actually allowed you to do something called nesting right but the problem was that people used to nest like five levels deep they would have like um let's just say like card underscore title underscore text underscore like uh link or something like that and it just got super complicated so bem is a really good naming convention which i recommend everyone goes and learns we actually use this in all of our builds really really important stuff i i hated it when i started by the way guys i really didn't see the value in them so i'm somebody who got converted on this and i really do live by it now so something definitely worth learning and because he's a big fan of them now too oh yeah now i know about this now guys with pwa oftentimes we get that question like hey what's a pwa which actually was a question i had in the chat when we were coding and then steve answered but like this is progressive web apps so this is where you're coding in a way where literally like whatever you're building will essentially be turned into a mobile app as well for a phone and it's like native so that's a little bit about how progressive web apps work you want to add anything on this sony um i think on the next side we have a really nice breakdown so basically you're gonna you're coding like a web app but it's very very similar to your native app right so here's a bunch of features of a pwa so you have it's fully responsive and it has a very high browser compatibility right when you use uh create react app with react it is making a pwa just in case you're wondering uh it works offline so you can use something like service workers service workers make the app super fast and allow that offline sort of functionality which you get with a normal app it has like an app like interface so you can actually go ahead and click the more option on like an iphone for example and you can add it to your home screen and it actually gives you a native app fill so it goes onto your home screen and even removes the browser the bar at the top when you open it so it's like super clean you can also get push notifications which is really important but i don't know why and if apple will ever watch this video i don't know can you guys hurry up on that because android allowed push notifications on pwas for a very long time but apple was still on the fence with it so it's been a big discussion and they're really pushing for it but i really do want them to do that but you can get push notifications on a pwa yeah nice and you've already talked about that it's fast with service workers so these are the features of pwa awesome now you got a lot of type checkers like typescript and then you got flow there's typescript and oftentimes people are like what is typescript so what is typescript sunny so it's a superset of javascript so it basically sits on top so it's not like a different language or anything like that it's just like a layer on top of java javascript and basically if you came from a java background or any strongly typed language background then you'll know what types are right so javascript's a weekly type language which means that you don't have to say that a string is going to be a string you have to say that a number is going to be a number et cetera your number's going to be an integer but with typescript you now get that functionality and it also gives you a bunch of other things like inheritance and all these other things that you had in those strongly typed languages so it's basically like like the visual here it's like a super jacked up jack javascript nice i love that image alex goes thanks for the comment shout out clever programmer but i've been asking this and just got aired are you planning to make an eight hour long video for learning react.js yes we are it's gonna be probably 12 hours long yeah and it's gonna have like a lot of amazing content in it so let's move forward with this this is typescript versus flow yeah so guys literally this is a big opinionated debate and i've actually got into huge debates in actual professional companies where we talk about are we going to use typescript are we going to use flow my opinion on this matter is use typescript because it's much more sort of picked up now it's much more in use it's much more robust and the power and it's actually supported by microsoft um i i believe so it's actually they're working as well but it's more of an official uh superset of javascript as opposed to i think that it has a new name now which i think you probably haven't heard about oh yeah yeah it's actually called hype script this is where we need the bell you know hey so yeah guys you know look into it all right we got dino so what's the hype all about all right so dino we always see comments flying in about dino and yes guys if you're interested in about you know we can go ahead and make a video about it it's basically a runtime environment so just like you have node.js right which runs on the servers dino also runs on servers and it's pretty much a case of it's like a it's like a more modern version of node.js so out of the box um it supports typescript whereas node.js you have to install a bunch of things to get typescript so that's an example of the difference it also comes with a bunch of uh it's built in rust i believe so it's very optimal it's very fast uh i think it may pick up but it's very it's very early in in that journey so definitely something which i mean is it's one of those cool things if you're interested in this and you're you're what you're enjoying the video sure go check out dino we can make a video on that awesome all right so now let's get into there's stuff going on here with webpack so webpack is pretty important to learn why is this important why should we care so yeah so when you're learning uh like especially when you're trying to build progressive web apps i recommend you kind of start with create react apps you don't have to jump in with and learn web packs because they basically get rid of that headache for you but when you go into a professional environment and you're doing any sort of javascript i can be sure like you can be sure that they're going to actually be handling the build process with webpack by itself or something like rollup.js which is a different one but basically what this does guys is it bundles your app so all the files all the css all of those things into one bundle which is then served and that's what the user sees as and then go right so definitely something which is quite important and you should go ahead and learn yep definitely dev tools guys master chrome dev tools you can do so much with this thing this is probably one of the most important things i mean i don't even know how you can develop apps or develop web stuff without doing this because that's the number one ask for learning but this is pretty much that thing you do when you go on chrome and you right click and inspect right the thing that pops up that allows you to do everything so like if i was just to demo it for anybody that doesn't know about this like literally if you go on youtube right now you should know how to use things like death tools at a very basic level at least and then you can master but you should master them so you know for people who have never like looked into it let's wait for this to pop up there oh damn our freaking video is the first recommendation let's go nice so nice so now guys over here we got logan paul he's thinking about youtube we have grant cardone talking about how to close over the phone but i can actually hit inspect yeah and then i can even choose this and i can go ahead and literally change the name of this thing over here or find out how youtube is using you know how is youtube formatting this how are they using html and css and i can then use that to reverse engineer this into kind of my own app and you guys can go ahead and change like some of the copy that's on here so this is something uh i this is something i actually do pretty regularly because i want to put my video here and check what it actually looks like so we can actually say you know we're going to be dropping our twitter clone project tomorrow with the react js and you can see boom it just popped that in so this is just a basic basic example of this i'm sure most of you probably know how to use it more than this and it's one gonna be one of your most important tools to use so dev tools and chrome 100 learn that yeah and also guys we like if you're debugging console logging everything out is a really good way of debugging so you definitely need to use uh dev tools when you're console logging yep 100 so let's go to next one what is this this is the react profiler so when you're coding with react it's all about once you get to a certain level it's about making your react app optimal so that you know that it's only rerendering what it needs to rerender the react profiler is just you access it in the same way that kazi showed you how you access the inspector but you need to install that i believe on the the chrome extensions but basically guys that's basically it's a very very good way of checking what's rendering inside your react app and how many times it's rerendering it also allows you to manipulate the state and the props so you can actually go in their head and you go you can go and check out and you can change the state and properly when you're sort of building out an app it can really help you out and assets just wrote a good comment he says stick with node for now dino's community is not that big big as it is very new and that's a very good point you guys for now before you jump on the hype train of dino stick with node kind of learn dino for like hobby projects you know do stuff on the side so you're just aware of it but npm isn't gonna go anywhere it's gonna be there for pretty much for a really long time and if dino really starts to take off then siri more seriously start looking into it but you know i do say that the hype train matters if you catch trends that helps put you ahead of people so you know i think it's not a bad idea just even as a hobby play around with it and kind of get to know it yeah definitely and guys it's just going to make you a better frontend developer when you when you mess around with these tools and then you sort of get more and more used to all of these things um so nothing no harm with going ahead and learning it 100 now native apps and react native what is this yeah so guys if you code in react just know that you're going to get the benefit of actually then transferring pretty much like 90 percent of that knowledge to something called react native and the react native allows you to build native ios and android apps so really really powerful to to be able to do that and i've actually first hand done this and you can get full full native apps with the same react code base pretty much so really really powerful beautiful and electron allows you to make desktop apps so this is uh electron js right that's the library yeah i think slack is actually built with electrons i think slack is built with electron and yesterday i discovered something else pretty huge was built with electron somebody messaged me on instagram saying some garbage uh zacky actually he usually says really great things but he sent a message saying something funny and then i responded to him let me see if i can actually pull up his message because that was pretty um insightful i mean you can talk about this for a second while i look for it yeah so guys really really uh useful stuff here like the fact is like if you know what slack is you know how popular and you know how much that's taken off it just shows you that yes you can also make you can make money from like mobile apps and web apps but guys remember their desktop apps started the whole thing off right like having like microsoft word having those things actually started at the whole i got it zacky zaki sent me a message on instagram and he said no offense but electron gs is crap with normal windows development you just need to learn c sharp with some xml you know some c c sharp with some xml in your set so that's it pretty easy huh and then he goes personally i'd rather learn that instead of electron but js is definitely powerful with no cap and i responded to him and i said visual studio code is built with electron js and also slack is built with electron js so i'm like i'd ease up on calling that crap yeah the visual studio code is what you're going to be using to code that c sharp that you were talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know just that's what it is like it's a valuable thing learn it i think it's it can be helpful if you want to make desktop apps now let's talk about testing frameworks so testing so let's talk about unit versus integration versus for functional testing so so three different types guys we've got an example here called of just called and basically that's an example of unit unit testing is when we test one specific area of an app right or like a website so it's a very specific thing right integration is when we integrate two different areas of an app and we test it together so like does this screen work with this screen or does this sort of functionality with this one crossing over with this one work together and then functional is like as a user if i do a login and i go through the entire journey is it everything working so you see like there's a big difference between the three just is a very very common um unit testing framework which is used and they usually combine it with something called enzyme so on the next side we have enzyme and here we have uh it's basically very very popular i'm sorry i just want to interrupt you for a second elizabeth who's also you know future code and she said and she was supposed to have a few interviews this week i think she's actually in la right now and she said she was having a few interviews and she said right now i had a major interview for a qa test engineer position while demoing my projects i casually left my deployed netflix app up in the browser and dropped it in they asked me to come back for the next round oh that's nice that's awesome especially if you're doing qa guys they're going to look at that and be like whoa this guy this person can like code this stuff oh wow we just got a five dollar donation oh thank you guys thank you so much and uh at one modus says hey kazi you help me to go from zero coding knowledge to qa automation tester way back in chicago five years ago oh nice oh that is amazing um dude can you drop your name in the chat because i think like i personally worked with you in person five years ago like literally i used to work with him in panera bread on teaching him coding so that would be awesome if you did that yeah i think so nice um before we started clever programmer but what future code was saying earlier was like the netflix clone that we actually built a few days ago and she had that open on the interview so you guys this stuff is powerful this can actually help you land jobs and then she went ahead and future code said i know my updated portfolio thanks to clever programmers getting recognized by companies for sure thanks guys awesome love that yep that makes us super super happy all right so we got just out of the way now what's up with what is this so enzyme so just as a unit testing framework that is most uh most of the time in react we combine it with enzymes so enzymes are testing utility for react and it basically allows you to test the user interface very easily so like if i click this button is the expected uh change on the page gonna happen or not right and it allows you to test all of that extremely fast and what people tend to do is something called test driven development where they'll write these tests using enzyme ingest first and then they would basically build the functionality until the test passes so something to definitely take he dropped it in and he said yes it's modesto from panera yep man that is awesome thank you so much for the donation i really appreciate it and that is amazing that was before any clever programmer any of that that was a great time so i appreciate you for sticking around and even now like helping out that's insane dude that's amazing nice go ahead yeah so we talked about enzyme enzymes a really popular one but what the problem was is that when sort of reactor really quickly evolved so we started seeing hooks and those sort of things uh enzyme quickly kind of got pushed to the side and react testing library is now part of create react app by default so this is a testing library and it supports hooks it supports all of the latest features um and when you use create react app you notice me and kazi usually delete these files um but if we're gonna eventually we will teach you we'll teach you guys how to go ahead and we personally don't like to test a lot yeah we test for like testing ourselves in a professional environment i guess yeah we could go ahead and teach some testing at some point like in a professional environment you would have modesto and he would be helping out with testing you would actually have somebody who has a job as a qa engineer who's doing the testing and so that way you yeah but i mean i think it's still important to learn test driven development i used to do it actually but i think it's just i'm lazy and i avoid it yeah and honestly guys my take on that is if you know how to do testing well for example if you get an interview and they ask you to build something if you write some unit tests in that interview watch them go a bit crazy like that's my honest advice to you guys just write a couple of tests and they will they will look at you and they'll put you above everyone else you submitted just by writing a few unit tests so just a little top tip there that's important that's actually really important uh to know that so you guys get your testing right and then you can actually um you know i think everybody should be getting tested right now uh anyway but you know get your get this right and you'll probably get a job too so the next one guys is functional testing we spoke about unit we spoke about integration but functional is when like it's basically mimicking what a user would do inside your app so an amazing one that i really recommend you guys go ahead and play with is something called cyprus to io and basically like if you want to log in the entire login journey see if everything's working you can pretty much record the journey and literally do it as you would do it and then it will programmatically write the code for you which is amazing uh and then you just click run and it'll basically run through your entire app super fast and you can do this in a really like a productive way and you can have this running in the background when every time you push your code something definitely worth looking into you now you guys might have heard of something called selenium selenium is uh modesto got a job doing selenium oh nice nice but yeah so like selenium was the most popular automation testing um framework for a very long time but it was quite clunky and then the guys over at site who who made cyprus style saw that it was clunky and soils outdated so they went ahead and built cyprus and cyprus i think it's only for chrome but it works so fast compared to selenium so guys like i really would recommend you just play with cyprus if you haven't ever tried that before and it's really easy yeah so yeah trice i burst you guys and um just want to say that we broke 18 000 views so far nice uh so thank you guys so much for that we're only an hour and 25 minutes into it we're uh yeah we still got a lot more value bombs coming for you guys but just to recap you guys we've talked about a lot of things we've talked about sas we've talked about react being the framework that you should choose we've talked about learning javascript we've talked about learning firebase and how that will be your frontend your backend your hosting cloud messaging like all of those things allinone database we have talked about even now we're talking about uh we talked about coding editors which coding editors best so visual studio code was our recommendation and right now we're talking about you know what testing frameworks you should use and between cypress and selenium and all these ones we recommend use cypress so there's a lot that we've covered but there's still a lot more that we're going to be covering so keep taking notes have a legal pad next to you because this is one of those videos that can really if you watch it and you follow everything that's laid out in here you can very realistically have a job plan three sixmonth 12month plan like a solid plan that can actually land you a job exactly we also covered just to add on to that list we actually covered the five key concepts for uh as a visual like a visual design yeah so really important stuff and guys oh one thing i want to say is i don't know i think yesterday might have been the biggest day of our subscribers i kind of just want to check real quick but we're hitting a lot of craziest number of subscribers thanks to you guys because you guys are coming in for the live streams and oh my god like look at this this is actually the biggest day we have ever had what so look at yeah so look at this this is our subscribers column and if you guys take a look at this you guys are helping us fly and we were hitting 1000 and then after you guys started jumping in two thousand three thousand four thousand yesterday was the biggest day we had in a really long time and that was 5 000 so thank you guys so much for subscribing to the channel and really just showing us your love and one reason i want to give you to subscribe to the channel which is actually i think really important is we're gonna be dropping the twitter clone uh we're gonna be dropping the twitter clone tomorrow so if you subscribe to the channel i don't want you to miss out on it it's gonna come up like a nice notification on your phone all the way at the top so when you subscribe make sure to turn the bell notifications on so just like gary vee's videos or whoever's videos you watch show up right here graham stefan or grant cardone or whoever you watch our twitter clone will pop up right there and then you can just click it whether you're bored you're in a line you're waiting for something or you just want to like learn and build it and add it to your portfolio you can just click and jump in so go ahead if you want to build twitter clone project and these types of things that we're building on a regular basis subscribe to this channel right now please and then turn on the bell notifications alongside it definitely make sure you guys don't miss that tomorrow will be a lot of fun and it'll be your chance if you haven't already to do your first build or add to your portfolio if you've been following us yep so what's up with the server side rendering yeah so this is a hot topic uh when it comes to sort of frontend development so server side rendering if you guys don't know what it is it's when most of the time when we sort of build a react app or any sort of app it's usually sort of we go on a web page we request the web page and then they basically send us all the files everything sort of loads the javascript loads on our browser right now that works pretty quick for the most part but what if you want the website to be super fast like if you wanted to basically as soon as you go on that website snap the things loaded so what happens is with server side rendering basically when you make that request when i go into for example google.com or something like that what's going to happen is we send that request google servers does all of the heavy lifting so it basically gets the entire web page bundled together right so it does the entire it bundles the entire webpage together and then it just serves the entire thing at once right so it basically does all the javascript calculations all that sort of uh that stuff which usually does take time on the page and what does this mean it means that the time to interaction is less so that's a crucial thing when you're a frontend developer how quick is the time to interact what i mean by that is when when you click on like say for example you go on facebook.com how quickly is it before you can start playing around with the page right yeah that's a crucial guys as a frontend developer you want that time to interact to be as low as possible serverside rendering is the answer to get that down damn awesome i think we complemented your words very nicely with the written yeah that's really nice awesome awesome so let's go here so what's this next.js so yeah next.js is one of the most popular uh server side rendering frameworks uh and it's very hot right now so if you're looking in this space i would recommend uh maybe look at preact preact is a very lightweight version of doing server side rendering but next.js is the one to use if you're gonna go ahead and do it in uh in a professional environment and i did actually use this so in america you have walmart in in england you have something called tesco tesco is like the size of walmart pretty much uh and it's they use next.js in that uh to render their web pages so it's massive um and basically it's it's extremely powerful it also offers a bunch of like powerups to react out of the box so really really something to definitely go ahead and play with it's a different way of thinking um but it is kind of uh once you learn it it's gonna pay off the value will pay off it'll be very valuable to an employer yeah so it's definitely something which i recommend you guys go ahead and look at um it's also going to take you this will definitely take you guys from a midlevel frontend developer to a senior like that you need this to be to be considered like a senior level developer when we're talking about a seniority inside of a company dang that is powerful by the way guys are these captions that we're providing for what sonny's saying or what i am saying are these actually helpful and valuable to you but i mean to me sunny this is actually super helpful because it's almost like we're making a slide on the fly yeah honestly i found it i find it really really helpful even me reading over it it clears everything up so yeah definitely let us know in the comments guys if you guys find that valuable and if you do just simply hit the thumbs up button as well [Laughter] nice that was a clean just smooth one was my favorite because it didn't even make sense but i like it i like it yeah i love it okay so build time what am i looking at here right so this is actually moving on to the next thing which is called uh where if i think if you hit next it will jump up it was basically we were talking about statistics right i'm kidding generators so the text i think comes on the on the click yeah yeah so now we're talking about stack site generated so kazi what is a static site generator so you have you ever used one yeah you know me i'm just using jekyll like before i even knew what coding was i was freaking using jekyll like crazy i don't know anybody use jekyll here drop it in the comments below i think it's awesome we're in a blog post today and i started laughing because hugo right yeah yeah hugo yeah so i know like most of the people yeah i see ali and hendrick they're saying actually it's very helpful logan says very valuable 181 modis modesto says yes awesome so yeah this stuff are you laughing at what just sonny just said yeah frankie is laughing too so this is this is uh this makes your site really really fast the static site generators i think are kind of useful to know static site generators also uh github pages generate static sites right and but there are things like jekyll that you want to know where they can take your dynamic content and turn it into static sites i just find it so funny because when you said jekyll i had no idea what it meant yeah yeah you were so confused you're like what is this yeah guys basically what jekyll's going to do it's going to take all your content it's going to make it into one stack like bundle and then it's just going to serve that bundle whenever anyone requests or goes on to your page which is a lot faster than it sounds like uh typically when you go into a website that javascript that you've coded actually has to load dynamically on the browser but when you've got a static site generator you basically make that bundle once and it just serves it every time so really really handy to actually go ahead and build something and if you're looking for speed stacks site generators are your answer the most popular one is gatsby really really popular right now if you've got any kind of sales page ecommerce site or anything gatsby's a really really powerful thing or landing page or portfolio if you go ahead and build a portfolio and say this is written in gatsby uh it's going to be quite impressive to like show to an employer so i'd recommend that you do that if you have got a portfolio um really really awesome thing to go ahead and guys these are all things that you can just like add to your skill set like if you can say i know react that's great that's really good but if you can then go ahead and say i can do server side rendering my portfolio like i know a portfolio is very simple but if you can say this portfolio is server side rendered or like this portfolio is built on react or on gatsby it kind of just adds that sort of like oh like if i was an employer i would get butterflies in my tummy if you told me your freaking portfolio's on using next js i'd be like holy crap because because the employee is going to know though interview he just did that right crazy okay awesome so what's going on here so we got all the are these these are all the static site frameworks right yeah these are a lot of points and next.js is also a static site hey made it up here nice what's next bro i always hear about this it just sounds so dumb yeah i don't know i've actually i've heard about it but i've never looked into it all i know is gatsby in there i think they're only getting i think they're just getting clout from nextjs traffic that misspells it they down yeah next next by mistake uh next djs is the real one and then next is uh something else yeah this is proper stupid name so what's the difference between gatsby and next.js sonny so gatsby is just a static site generator guys nexjs handles serverside rendering and also gives you the static site generator um advantages so if you're looking at um sort of debating between the two i would recommend nextgs is going to provide you more value so i would go ahead and jump into that so your research app your react dynamic app you'll probably use next.js but maybe if you're hosting a portfolio or something static like that use gatsby yes because gatsby yeah a very good point now yeah gatsby's going to be quite easier to implement over in xjs so i'd recommend going ahead and using gatsby if you've got like a simple landing page or something fast you need up and running and you need it easy to maintain gatsby if you're looking for a long term benefit or you're looking for something to get something out there or you're trying to build your portfolio for a professional environment next yes yep so definitely something worth investing your time in awesome let's go to next uh oh somebody said next is typically next.js but for vue.js oh nice yeah and thank you the greatest ever says gonna be watching this tomorrow because i'm finishing up the spotify clone but wanna thank you guys deeply and dearly for the amazing work the whole team is doing thank you so much really appreciate you i mean yeah we're all working right now so this slide was put together by sunny and also uh alex right now frankie yeah and amanoth from the clever programmer team i came in and help there are a bunch of slides that are coming in from like the previous slides that uh we had all made together frankie is working on responding to every single person making sure everything is going phenomenally well so a lot of the chat is me and also frankie and so yeah guys it's like everything every single one of these every day is like a really big team effort so thank you guys for being here and also just taking the time to appreciate that thank you now thank you guys if you guys are still not sure how to get started or you guys want to figure out how to make money as a developer let me know are you guys interested in learning how to make money as a developer this part we wanted to add in for you guys to show you how you can actually start going out and making money as a frontend developer or whatever type of developer you want to become today so this will be the part with freelancing tips with tips of getting your jobs if you're interested let me know and let's go let's do it so the first avenue guys is what kazi the first avenue is becoming i love this becoming a teacher so you can actually with whatever skills you have learned you can actually teach that to other people and you can make an income from doing that like for example okay this is the craziest example but you guys see we're just teaching you guys we're teachers right sunny and i are teachers sunny and i are not just like going crazy working at a job right now we're actually taking the time out to actually teach you guys and we're even getting donations and we're getting paid to teach literally and so what it looks like at a oneonone basis and is you can actually post your ad on craigslist and you could post your ads on kijiji if you're in canada or you can post your ad on really whatever platform you want and somebody can pay you for you to teach them and you don't have to be so far ahead of them you could just be a little bit ahead of them and charge them for teaching them yeah exactly and guys this is one this is one that i really emphasize in our course a lot with our students because this is the one that you can literally start doing even a week after you start learning how to code like if you're a week ahead of somebody who's never coded before you're now you're now in a position to provide a week's worth of value to somebody who's never coded before so you can actually go ahead and start teaching that right and then only from that day onwards that value only grows right so if you're immediately going to grow your income source and you and the earlier you start the better and it is uncomfortable but like when you just jump in dive into the deep end you're going to go ahead and build that skill and it's always going to be a skill that you can turn to to make some more income yep now this is one way that we'd like to show it to you guys okay so let me go ahead and do that for you guys so let's go ahead here and take a look at this what sunny is saying right so sunny you're saying if i have like literally if you think about levels right let's say you're a complete beginner and you're at level one you just know how to write hello world and then here is level 10 where you use serverside rendering for breakfast so in between all these levels and then let's say you're doing javascript you don't have to you can use any language python or you know go it doesn't matter but let's just use javascript for now and if you are a level one can you teach another level one probably not really right if all you know is hello world you can't really teach much to another person who also knows hello world so if you are over here and actually let's do this right so they're like let's say there's two people here and here yep and um you're like let's say you're on the left hand side and you're teaching this person okay yeah and this is over here i'm just gonna put a little mark and that's gonna say that's you okay now if you're teaching this person you're gonna they're gonna be paying you in return yep and um if you're a level two it's very possible that you can actually be teaching somebody who's a level one yep 100 right because you can you can teach them so like for example what does a level two mean maybe you have put in at level two maybe you've put in like 50 hours into coding yeah okay let's say you know how to write functions loops data types you know that stuff yeah you know what array is you know what you know so for example right now you can charge this person you could charge them maybe like ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars an hour so i'll just put like you know ten dollars at that point you can charge them an hour okay now when you get up to level three and you can teach a level two you're gonna get paid more for that yeah does that make sense so now you might actually make maybe more than ten dollars an hour maybe now you make you now you can make like 18 an hour teaching i just want to stress here guys notice now that your pool of potential students has also grown now you can target level two and level one students yep you can target exactly that's important so you could target both that's huge that's a really good point and then what happens when you're a level four or you're a level five let's say right if you're a level five well what does a level five look like i think a level five is somebody who has put multiple uh you know they've like followed of all of our youtube videos and made all the clones yeah exactly you know they understand like how apis work they understand how uh you know how to put together like their portfolio and they have multiple projects to show for it maybe they don't have real world coding experience where they're getting paid at a job but other than that they're like pretty decent yeah right and that might actually look like what maybe 500 hours of coding or maybe yeah 500 to like 700 hours of coding yeah might actually put you here and now at this level you guys you guys can actually charge a pretty significant amount of income so if you're a level five and you're teaching level fours and stuff like that it's very possible for you guys to make at least in us you know for your own countries you would have to do the rough translation but in us it's very possible for you to charge 35 an hour or even 50 an hour and you have experience with teaching people right sunny i definitely do yeah so even literally and guys there's no age limit when you come to teaching i've taught people who are like much older than me and i've also taught a student who was young as 12 years old who landed his own client which is insane like that's so it really does not matter what age or or what experience you're at you can teach yeah yep and so if you are teaching other people you just have to do the math right so at 35 an hour you know i use teaching to make well over a hundred thousand dollars a year now of course everybody's gonna be at a different level different like how much effort you put into it how much time you put into it but a few of these clients that are paying you either 35 or 50 an hour it the math to getting to 1 000 a month like that's the first type of math you should do so let's figure out sunny how long would it take like what it would take for us with at fifty dollars an hour to get to making thousand dollars a month okay so if i'm making 50 generally when you have students they'll do about two hour long sessions how long are your sessions with your students they're one hour 30 minutes yeah typically i start with one hour because it's quite an intense session and then i'll eventually see and if they can handle a twohour session so let's set two hours yeah i don't push more than two yeah okay because they get fried in that time so let's say you're doing one hour sessions yeah at fifty dollars an hour yeah right uh you're doing one session per week yep okay so one x per week that turns out to be four sessions per month right yep and uh how much is that you guys if you have one student at you know doing four times a month at 50 an hour in one month that is two hundred dollars yeah now what happens if now what do we need to do sunny to get up to with the same exact math to get up to one thousand a month we just need to land five students yep guys that's it so or increase or increase the frequency of a student but landing five students is going to get you that yeah yep so you can go both ways it's important what sunny just said so you guys can either in it's really hard to increase the price at 50. i mean it's hard to go with that sooner to 75 or 100 to double the price would be tough but what might be a lot more doable is maybe sunny can start to have two hour lessons with those students and now that student will pay sunny 400 a month yeah right exactly or sunny can get a total of five students uh for they each do four x a month sessions at 50 an hour and now that's a thousand dollars a month yeah and guys something i want to stress at this point when you get very good at having a lot more students and you can actually get to a point where you can do group sessions so if you find that you're running out of time where you find that you're getting like kind of intense with the timings you can go ahead and run i wouldn't recommend having large groups because you you lose the one to one but you can definitely go ahead and actually go ahead and split like maybe and have a group of three group of four yeah and you can even give them a discount right so for example if you were charging a 50 maybe you charge them 40 per session yeah but now it's a group session so in one hour instead of you making 50 dollars now with three students you make 120 in an hour of your time exactly and it's a good deal for all of them yeah it's actually a better deal than them doing oneonone if they do because they all become a part of the group too and they can all slack each other they can all message each other so that's powerful definitely so i i think that one of the best ways for almost all of you guys including the ones who have a job i think is like guys what would you do if you had extra thousand dollars a month coming in start dropping it in the comments below you know what would the thousand dollars a month allow you to do would it allow you to you know pay your bills wouldn't would you get netflix membership would you get membership to i know gyms are closed but maybe would you get like calisthenics equipment for your home and then do workouts there would you get a course that you've always wanted would you i don't know pay for your parents rent and help out what would a thousand dollars a month allow you to do i think it's important to have those goals because then you will actually want to do more and achieve more other than rather than just like going through life like a zombie yeah and these guys it's really important to determine what your why is like why are you doing this stuff like why are you teaching why are you even here right now trying to learn how to code like remember that because that is going to give you that consistent discipline and motivation to carry on when times get tough yeah so like for example sunny can't sit there through like hundreds or thousands of hours of coding and then like through all the debugging and all the frustration of not making something work where literally he's trying to figure out one goddamn trick with flexbox and it takes them seven hours of like how does this grow shrink thing work or like why you know it's a 0.8 or a 0.9 flex and how does he or somebody like me get through so much coding if our why was weak and we didn't have a good reason we would not get through any of that you know if so it has to be something more important to you than just money exactly a few answers coming in though uh for what people would spend with a thousand so it would allow me to pay my rent uh and also pay my sibling fees and get to meet some of their basic needs awesome mark says i would invest in stuff and develop myself nice and uh ken laps as he uh get a wife [Laughter] nice douglas says i would join profit with javascript awesome hey um so let's go back to what we're talking about here you guys so now this is the math to getting to a thousand a month you guys it's not that freaking hard now to go to 2000 a month what do you need to do and guys here's a better way to look at it this is not a thousand a month this is actually let me write that up top at the top left this is actually five students is 12 000 a year yeah that's the right way to look at it it's actually 5 000 or it's actually 12 000 a year yep and if you guys want to get to 24 000 a year or 2 000 a month 10 students and you guys can see the growth here from 5 to 10 students isn't actually a lot but the growth in your income is significant yes very significant so this is something you guys can do guys so easily like their instagram you can go and instagram people on coding channels and start having conversations with them and say i will help you for free for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on a video call with you and help you you can go into a facebook group and ask people if they need help and give them a free session and then at the end of the free session say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed this if you want me to help you more i'm um you know i charge 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge 35 an hour 50 an hour something like that does that make sense you guys you guys can literally do this today you don't need to wait for anything you don't need to wait for anyone so this is possible for you guys now there are online tons of amazing platforms where you guys can go and start teaching so i will give you more ways of making income but this is actually one really big pillar of having your income come in so we'll talk about some of those platforms right now and then we're going to go ahead and continue with the video but there are important platforms that you guys should know and write down so one is takelessons.com and the other one is wiseand.com so these are really good platforms look in the u.s that are great for finding lessons but if you're not in the u.s look at people per hour look at fiverr.com yeah and um also you guys have facebook and instagram which is worldwide right you can go into groups programming groups and help people there and you can get clients from there very easily okay we have some students try this strategy and they literally have clients the next day and of course i think craigslist is worldwide so use craigslist as well and we'll list out all of these resources for you guys at the end and also guys one worth mentioning is instagram so literally if you just go ahead and document your journey as a developer you'll actually be surprised that how many people reach out and ask for help ask for this and you can actually then convert that to a potential student that you start teaching yep exactly so let's i'm gonna go ahead and now guys this works if you're working extremely hard and you can teach people who are you know literally one level behind you you don't have to be so far ahead of them to teach them remember so you can be a level two teaching a level one you can be a level five teaching everybody underneath it so yep let me go ahead and save this and then go here and i'm gonna remove this now cool so let's move forward here now i'm gonna skip through a little bit of this you guys and we're gonna go you know i even have some math here you can take a look at it but if you if you wanna go on the instagram route or facebook route where you kind of want to do hand to hand combat you can dm 100 people something interesting like not please sorry mommy can you please i beg you we that's like 99 of the messages i get in my dms um so don't do that that'll be bad nobody will respond to you'll get ignored but if you give them a good message that's like positive hey i see you are crushing it at skateboarding absolutely love that and i see that you're also doing coding pump for you that's it don't ask anything don't want anything don't need anything don't beg don't put more than one question mark ever even in our chat if i ever see more than one question mark ever i'd never respond to that person so yeah um be clean be a clean giving caring human being and if you send those messages uh 20 people out of the 100 will respond to you okay five will get on you can get on a call with five of those people if you close one person that's just from one client you're gonna make 320 a month now you can do this strategy whether you want to freelance and actually code for people and build websites or build apps for them and this will work for you even if you want to do it for coaching okay this works for both now one student or one client can be worth up to three to four thousand a year if not more just one all right so that is a pretty important and helpful thing for you guys to know now if you want to go from 3 000 a month and you're like hey how do i actually take that from 3 000 um and go you know that 3 000 a month guys is actually 36 000 a year so yeah this is that's always important to kind of remember that and um i'm going to kind of move past some of these and here's the resources you guys can use so you guys can use facebook groups and sonny you want to talk about some of these resources as well yeah yeah so we have facebook groups we talked about instagram why's that and take lessons uh because you showed that they proved if you're in the u.s they work really good people per hour craigslist is something which you'd be surprised actually works upwork fiverr linkedin is actually surprisingly good guys yes um so a lot of people do reach out and and go on and linkedin is something where it's like a growth thing like you build up that network and you'll be surprised at what like if somebody would just share your name and say i know a guy who can code and before you know it you have a lot of my sort of jobs have actually been through word of mouth surprisingly um so yeah definitely go ahead and check out linkedin yep go check those out now guys one thing i just want to say is just like a direct message to you you are watching this right now yes literally you i'm looking at you 99 of you are gonna do nothing with this information okay you're gonna do absolutely nothing and i love you but it's also the truth it's just a hard truth it sucks i'm gonna even say it's less than one percent of the people that are gonna actually take action on it but my goal is that just that just that one percent person just one person to take action out of the 20 000 that watch this or 50 000 that watch this that's the only person i care about the only person i care about here is like modesto who five years later messaged in the youtube and he said hey i got a job as a q engineer because of our sessions that we would do so to that one person who's actually going to do something on it here's what i want to tell you please take action on this and what i want from you is literally next oh you to get an instagram message that says you landed a job that says you landed a client and you just sharing that with us whether it's on our live streams on youtube that we're doing every day or whether it's an instagram dm to me or sunny right our instagram handles are right there and so that's what we're looking for that one person to take action on this information go hey i actually landed a client i actually nothing is stopping you from literally reaching out to 500 people today i mean what are you doing anyway it's covered you can't go out so you're bored spend that time and reach out to 300 people or 500 people and send them something useful and helpful and then say i'm willing to jump on free calls free calls and give you help in coding and teach you coding i promise you're going to get one client at the very minimum just this week and then what we want to know is you saying hey i got that client i don't care even if they're paying you two dollars an hour but that's what we want to know so that's the one person i'm saying this message for exactly guys you heard him like literally that one person out there like it's just the truth guys like a lot of people were watching but this is cool but like who's going to actually take action and go ahead and do the things that they need to do to go and change their life because you just need to take action yeah all right don't think about it don't don't like overthink it just start doing it right now right today literally straight off to this live stream go ahead and do it yep alexandra says i earned 8 500 from just one student from 12t in the previous academic year nice that's amazing so he if he had 10 of those students he would be making 85 thousand dollars a year just from exactly execution guys i advise everyone to execute so do that ashkan and he says i myself don't do that we're gonna tell you to do it henrik says i will be that 0.1 percent if there's one person we're making this video for is that person who takes action on it so if that's gonna be you henrik i will personally talk to you and i will personally get on a call with you like that brings me the most joy that we're sharing something that you guys take action on and then if you do this and you land a client or a job or whatever i would want to bring you on the skype call with sunny and i or sonny and i would just even want to just call you and talk to you about the results 100 we wouldn't even hesitate literally if you take action on it and you get some results like 100 will jump on a call with you yep um so awesome love you guys so now let's move on to mark says i am already on linkedin and upwork but i still see myself as a beginner but i'm hungry guys don't say no for the other person this is one thing i learned from garyvee which is beautiful apply to the job that you're thinking about you know actually like send out the messages on take lessons wisen or whatever platforms to get clients you know uh if you're a beginner maybe you can still provide some value you know at the very worst case you can give refund or you can give the money back guarantee right but don't say no for the other person go all the way now with that said let's continue on here so boom got tons of things so working from home now you guys can use tons of online platforms if you want to do freelancing the reason why we mentioned teaching is i think it's the easiest thing to get into it's also a thing you can scale up forever like we're teaching you right now exactly so talk to me about this sonny yeah so we spoke about number one which was teaching and that's definitely something you guys can do right now but when you obviously in teaching i just want to add to one thing guys like when you teach it makes you such a better developer like i can't stress that enough every single live stream that we teach every single time i teach a student i become a better developer because you're teaching that principle you're teaching the ability to code so you get actually naturally just become a better developer so you'll naturally grow to a position where you can offer value to clients you can offer value and that's where freelancing comes in as number two so three really good sites here to land freelancing clients we've got upwork freelancer.com and top tool right yeah the one sort of recommend here as being the most successful is upwork because freelancer.com you can get into sort of some battles with sort of a trying to bid for things but again if you build up quite a handsome sort of portfolio on freelancer.com i've seen people do really really well on that and guys a really nice benefit to freelancing is also it's remote so most of you um who are watching from different parts of the world right now you guys can tap into different markets you can tap into the united states you can tap into london you can tap into any market you want provided you just build that skill you build that skill the ability to freelance is is in literature and guys this is one thing i want to stress here you can scale to very very high numbers when you're just freelancing big numbers uh we had uh we have a student in our program profitable shortcut last month he called me he closed he did 28 000 in cash from freelancing he did and then within the first 10 days of um i think yeah within the first 10 days of the next month after that this guy did uh 12 000 already so that's insane crushing it and freelancing and doing scraping web scraping and automation and all kinds of things but he's just hustling and grinding and getting it done there's tons of opportunity out there but people just you know they just don't take advantage of it um awesome so by the way i want to say guys we just broke 20 000 views on this video total over 20 000 times it's been viewed so thank you guys so much for the love and i do want to say a lot of it is because of you watching this and you hitting that like button because it helped it did help send it out to more and more people and if you're watching this and you still haven't done that go ahead and just hit that like button because guys we want to make as many developers on the planet as possible that's our mission exactly and uh that's awesome so now you know boom with that said you know the third step that you guys would want to do is so you know the second thing we talked about is freelancing the third is getting a permanent job that's a lot of what people want to do but people go about it i feel like kind of in a backwards way where the first thing that they're looking for is a permanent job and that's really hard to get you guys when you're just starting out as a developer and that's why most people i know quit most people i know quit within one year almost every single person very few people stay after that one year mark and end up getting a job so i think that's a very discouraging route to go i think it's not the smartest or even the fastest route to go i think the fastest route to grow skill wise is to first teach it's going to grow your own skills the most you're going to be getting paid while you're learning yourself and then i think step two you should try to get so i think with uh you should start teaching in your first three months of coding okay you should start teaching within that time frame then around your sixth or ninth month you should actually start doing freelancing and then after a year or year and a half of experience i think you should go for a full job uh definitely curious to hear your thoughts on this too sonny yeah i would definitely say guys and i just want to kind of rule out a myth here so the way that you typically see this is like as you said it's very backwards right like what i usually see is people will go to university and then they would like study for three four years never had made a single penny when it comes to like their coding abilities and then they would go straight to step three which is a permanent job and you see like it just doesn't make sense like it doesn't make any sense like literally you could watch your youtube videos and you could sit there teach yourself how to code through like youtube videos through us guys through um through w3 schools or a bunch of online resources start teaching like through the methods we spoke about before start earning an income and then you build up that skill set from teaching you build up the ability to build up an income and you can grow that income at a rate that's very comfortable for you you then become a better programmer you can learn freelance clients and then all of that experience becomes extremely attractive to a an employer and that's not a secret to it that's a secret to having years of experience before ever having a job exactly you know that like it's almost like a circular thing that everybody always talks about you know it's like you must have two years of experience and it's an entrylevel job and you're like yeah exactly and the truth is guys if you go to an employer and they said five years experience and you only had one year but your one year consisted of you teaching a bunch of students killing it with freelancing jobs i'm telling you they would forget about that five years of experience and they would consider taking you on board yeah like it really does it just comes down to what you can offer them in terms of value so honestly focus on what you can like provide in terms of value and that skill that you can offer as opposed to going the traditional route of like university and then straight to the permanent position it just doesn't work that way in real life cold wakeman says i don't like teaching can i just do step two straight away yeah i mean it's gonna as long as you can develop the skill of coding and keep getting good yeah you can do step two of uh freelancing pretty much right away so here's how i break it down you guys so we call this the modern javascript developer pyramid of wealth and i we feel like this is how you can kind of stack all this on top of each other so one it's learn the coding skills to become a modern javascript developer so that's just coding skills learn that step two is you can start coaching people now this is a you can be a beginner and coach other people and the time to build the stream of income is one to three months all right yep and you can get this stream of income up to three thousand dollars a month if not more this is more on the conservative side and uh next up you can actually work freelance so this is you can work for clients independently and you can get this up to now you can get with just freelancing alone you can realistically be making 5k a month right sunny yeah 100 and guys again like as you said this is conservative so you can actually raise those numbers up divided on how hard you're working and you can build a stream of income within for your first four to 12 months of learning to code okay first four to 12 months just put in a lot of hours into coding okay a lot of people are like hey how did i start uh getting clients in three months of experience i just coded like 15 to 20 hours a day yeah and then guys just to just add on there guys it stacks up so while you have the freelancing you can carry on the coaching so it can stack up yeah yep i love that quan quang says you guys are so good in the community's standard is so high i haven't even seen one negative comment so far amazing i love that yep so this is the power of culture you guys you keep and appreciate the people you love you over nurture and love them and then anybody who's toxic you cut them so you don't have a long conversation with them you don't have a long back and forth you don't try to change their minds you just uh you just not communicate with them and you you they're not part of the culture anymore so that's how you can keep the culture at the highest standard possible at all times this is also true when it comes to your circle of friends you might be outgrowing because you're here i mean you here learning about frontend developer guide i can promise you a lot of your friends are probably not doing this right now a lot of the people around you are not doing this and they're not growth oriented so you also have to start thinking about who are the people that are not anymore a good fit for your circle so you have to actually one part of self growth is to be really loving and over nurturing and be really accepting the second part of self growth is having selfrespect and boundaries so those people aren't going to grow with you and aren't going to respect you then you have to move on and get a new set of friends right and then those set of friends they have to go yeah exactly and i i couldn't agree more in terms of like that negativity guys it's it's like a toxic sort of trait and it does spread like it's might start off with a small comment here and there but that will literally can destroy your work ethic if you stay around it long enough whereas if you surround yourself with hardworking people who are literally driven every single day i'm telling you you will literally just you start to mask their behavior you start to master their their sort of traits and then naturally you follow the same footsteps so really really is important to surround yourself with the white people yep super important and the last thing i want to mention is you guys the step four is to go get a job and work as a fulltime developer now required skill level for this is advanced okay which is why we think you should try to do this last and then time to build the stream of income is 12 to 24 months all right so this is gonna take 12 to 24 months and again it all stacks so you could be coaching and making 3k a month on top of that you could be freelancing and making 5k a month so now you're at 8k a month and then on top of that i mean this is probably going to get really hard or almost impossible you're you can have no time and no freedom to do anything but you could also be doing a job that's paying you like 7k a month so it's possible that you could have a potential of 15k a month or more income okay uh it depends on your hard work depends on what you do i'm just showing you guys this to see what's possible i'm not saying any of you will actually achieve this okay can i just add here guys that literally when i started working with qazi i had a fulltime job i was freelancing on the side and i was coaching so oh living yeah like i did all of those things now like kazi said is it something you can really hold on to like with all of them stacked on top of each other it really depends on how you manage your time but then i chose to sort of drop the freelancing and work like full time with kazi and like and and to carry on with coaching so it's really a case of like it's very flexible but you can actually do all three like you can do all three if you need to and you're in a position it's all down to how hard you're willing to work and the effort that you're willing to put in yep it really comes down to you um yep so this is awesome harish says you guys are awesome you guys boost the confidence in all of us all right so there you guys go if you guys want to take a picture of this go ahead and do so now i'll be moving this uh in five four three two one so let's go on to the next one so now guys if you want to be able to take all of these skills that we taught you right being uh if you want to be able to like learn if you want to be able to coach if you want to do freelancing and job and you want to stack these skills and these streams of income in this exact order that's exactly what we teach you how to do in our course profit with javascript all right yeah and in this course you know we have tons of students and they just have really really great experiences and daniel over here says in the future i'll continue to learn more and teach students we have muhammad he says i hope this community will be part of my future projects johnny bridge going i have zero coding experience i'm proud of creating my google maps app kate says thank you so much for this challenge and in the future i want to be a full stack developer and start freelancing so these are all the people that are part of our community and um let me talk just a little bit more is it okay if i talk a little bit more about profit with javascript you guys because of course we've just invested so much time and energy into building it out and making it the best possible resource on the planet for most developers so i would really appreciate it if sonny and i could speak on it for probably like a few minutes yeah definitely yeah so let me go over here and open this up boom while kazi does that guys i think it's worth uh actually telling you guys so i know we showed a few of those customer experiences there but we actually just hit over i think it's over 1500 students in the community right oh yeah yeah yeah so that is absolutely insane and i think i will show that in just a second to everybody so guys in our profit with javascript course uh this is our program profit with javascript and we have the url up here so you can go to it directly or you can click the link in the description below and that will take you to this page right away but this course profit with javascript we cover all of these things we talked about so you learning the skills of becoming a developer you learning how to become a you know so it has the 15 javascript training modules that will give you all the training that you actually need right underneath that if you look you have weekly javascript and react training calls and son you want to speak to the weekly training calls live yeah so guys like this is where we really like differentiate from like a udemy course or anything else that's kind of out there right now because in these coaching calls and in these live training course it's a really a chance for you to be able to actually communicate and run through your problems with us that you're experiencing we run through different very cutting edge projects every single week so literally it's a case of you're not on like a live stream you're on a zoom call so you're literally on a video call with me with nars with jacob with a few people in the community and guys like what i mean it's one to one feedback here like there's people asking questions you can interrupt me at any time we got we literally take things to a whole new level in these coaching calls and our students love it they literally thrive off of it afterwards there's an amazing slack community where they literally send me messages of the sort of homework that we sat that we go through together um we have an amazing pool of success coaches and cars what is a success coach success coaches are going to be people when you join the program you're going to be paired up with a success coach and what they will do is every single project that you actually submit or every homework assignment that you complete or every app that you build they're going to give you personalized video feedback on all of your assignments so imagine getting video feedback by somebody who's a lot more seasoned than you and as a skilled developer or sometimes they're even professionals and they give you feedback on your code they give you feedback on your app design and we get very technical with that so those are success coaches and they make sure that you're getting all of the work done exactly and guys a lot of people actually say when you combine the weekly coaching calls with the personalized video feedback the modules that you get and then on top of that all of the skills that we then go and like we teach you that and then we teach you actually how how to go and take those skills and start making money straight away with that our students are pretty much called this like a 10 it's worth it pretty much the equivalent of a 10k coding boot camp yeah my opinion go ahead in my opinion i honestly i've been to university i've done a master's degree and this is what i would have like if i knew something like this existed i just don't think i actually tell students now don't bother going to university just join like a course or community and change your life through this where you save yourself a lot of money and literally will transform your life and take you to that whole nother level of becoming a developer yeah this seriously will is a game changer you know and so that's why jose shapiro he told me he's like dude this is actually more valuable than my sixmonth coding bootcamp and he goes i paid ten thousand dollars for that one so yeah amazing you know so a lot of students are getting amazing results like you guys should go and check this out and uh i want to highlight the community real quick for you guys so you guys can see the caliber of people in the community that's actually part of profit with javascript well it actually full screen hold on so i'm gonna open up my app so this is actually a good app that you guys should know about it's called spectacle and it's really good for um man my computer is just freezing yeah i use spectacular it's really handy tool guys when you want to snap things to the left side of the screen right side screen go full screen really really cool um especially when you're sort of trying to be productive yeah yeah super valuable so i'm gonna click this and hopefully my computer doesn't freeze but the guys the community is absolutely insane in this program and we have over 13 we have now 1 400 members just in our slack community and this is not we're not even talking about the 1500 uh students that are just part of the course so that community is really what makes most students who come to the program stay they love the training they love all the material that's there they love all the projects but the fact that any question you have can can and will be answered in less than five minutes is massive for people and it will be answered by somebody who deeply cares by somebody who would even be sometimes willing to jump on oneonone calls with you so the heart that is really important and um the weekly calls you guys will have i mean of course you guys are building real world projects so i think if you are serious about becoming a developer and you want to get a job then i would highly recommend you check out this course and you know consider joining and being a part of this community and being one of us you know and we would get to actually meet you and speak with you on a regular basis yeah i think guys like to put this into context like how many times have you gone into stack overflow or like a website like a forum and sort of like been scared to ask a question or felt like you're stupid if you ask a question right in this community like we don't there's there's no such thing as a bad question like if you can directly once you're in literally message me jump on a call with me and and i always jump on calls with students we pretty much go through like any problem whether it be big small anything you pretty much can get an answer to um so it's definitely something which i recommend and we answer a ton of questions in those weekly coaching calls and it's all driven by you guys so in terms of the weekly coaching calls i see loads of questions about like uh functional class space and i see a bunch of other questions like guys whatever everyone wants to learn we go ahead and we answer every single thing inside those coaching calls um so there's a lot of value that is delivered in those and if you're interested link is in the description make sure you go and check it out yeah seriously check that out and with that said guys hopefully you guys got a ton of value i mean we just packed it with value the front end developer guide 2020 to 2021 uses as your bible for success uses your bible for a career as a frontend developer or honestly a lot of what we said works as a full stack developer as well so you know the recap of like learning about firebase and react and javascript and visual studio code and you know uh what best framework to use for testing like cypress io what are the pre processors that you should use you know for css and we talked about server side rendering and how the difference between a midlevel you know developer versus a senior level is knowing things like next js and using those types of things we talked about static side generators like gatsby or jekyll or hugo and all of that and we said hey use gatsby learn it so there's so much value that was packed in this and we just threw it all at you guys just make sure to keep going back to this to keep taking notes and really just following along i think personally i think honestly the most valuable part if i was watching this video is the part that shows you practically how to turn this into cash for yourself so yeah really pay attention to that and take action on it that's the one part that most people don't take action on so i just want to emphasize that yeah really really massive there guys in terms of because what you'll see here typically on websites and then just throughout the internet is like you'll find all of these skills how to do it and then you just don't know how to take that to that next level and that really does become a question and it kind of puts you in this horrible place it's very disheartening makes you kind of want to give up on programming so we really hope that we helped you out today and just in how to take that to that point of where you can actually start making income and you can actually enjoy the process a lot more because when you start earning from this you really do start to love it that extra bit and it starts to become that it starts to drive your life and change your life yep so that's
