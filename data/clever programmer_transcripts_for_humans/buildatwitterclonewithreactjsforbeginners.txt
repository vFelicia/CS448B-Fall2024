02:47 - be building okay this is the exact thing
02:49 - that you're
02:50 - guys gonna build we're gonna show you
02:51 - how to do this step by step
02:53 - now we're gonna be using material ui and
02:55 - flexbox for this type of stuff so
02:57 - material ui is gonna be used for all
02:59 - these icons that you guys are seeing
03:00 - on the left hand side for maybe even all
03:03 - these icons right over here
03:05 - and that's going to be material ui next
03:08 - up we're going to be using firestore
03:10 - so this is the firebase database so it's
03:13 - a real-time database
03:14 - and we can use it to even store things
03:17 - like comments
03:18 - so we'll show you guys how we're going
03:20 - to be using it uh
03:21 - in this project and we're going to talk
03:25 - a little bit about
03:26 - css variables in this one is that right
03:28 - sony yeah
03:30 - that's the first guys so this is the
03:31 - first time in one of these builds that
03:33 - we're going to introduce css variables
03:35 - so really exciting stuff
03:36 - and they're so powerful even when i was
03:38 - building today to the app today
03:40 - it actually does make everything so much
03:42 - simpler so we're going to go ahead and
03:43 - show you guys how to use css variables
03:45 - yup and if you just join right now don't
03:47 - worry to miss anything yet
03:48 - we haven't even gotten started to build
03:50 - we're just walking through what we're
03:51 - going to be covering
03:52 - we're going to cover animation so one
03:54 - library we're going to be using is the
03:55 - react flip move
03:57 - super slick you guys can see how nice it
04:00 - looks over here
04:01 - i mean wouldn't you want your app to
04:03 - look like this and
04:05 - feel like this and this provides so this
04:08 - is going to provide animations when
04:10 - we're posting tweets
04:11 - and it's going to give a overall really
04:13 - dynamic feel to the site
04:16 - exactly really really slick animation
04:18 - library guys and adds that finishing
04:20 - little touch
04:21 - whenever you're sort of building any app
04:22 - and that's really impressive when you
04:24 - show that to people
04:25 - when they see that animations kind of
04:26 - moving around so
04:28 - my torah says the kings of web dev
04:30 - tutorials strike again
04:31 - looking forward to another amazing build
04:33 - let's go
04:34 - let's do it now if we go over here
04:38 - now we're going to be using firebase to
04:40 - actually deploy it online meaning you
04:42 - can
04:42 - send this link out to your friend to
04:44 - your mom to your dad
04:46 - to your grandpa doesn't matter anybody
04:49 - and everybody will be able to go to
04:51 - your.com and use it so that's the thing

09:30 - let's do it so guys uh like we said
09:34 - we're going to be touching base on
09:35 - firebase
09:36 - and we're going to be building a dope
09:38 - twitter react
09:39 - app so with that said the first step
09:42 - guys is we actually need to go ahead and

12:12 - having them
12:12 - just guys if you do ping a question
12:15 - don't ask generic questions make it
12:16 - super direct because we get like
12:17 - hundreds of questions that come through
12:19 - so
12:19 - if the only way i can help is if you say
12:21 - like here's my problem and this is a
12:22 - screenshot of it then i can help you out
12:24 - otherwise
12:25 - super hard to help you guys out just
12:26 - want to make that sort of shout out
12:28 - while we're over here
12:29 - yep yep super helpful okay
12:32 - dope nice so what is what is now
12:35 - now that we're just diving into the
12:37 - actual code you guys some of the
12:38 - questions we're going to take on later
12:40 - and now we're just going to start with
12:41 - the build
12:42 - so where are we starting now sunny we're
12:44 - going to be doing the npx create app
12:47 - exactly so first step guys you want to
12:49 - open up a terminal and do mpx to create
12:51 - react app right so create react app and
12:54 - then you want to type in whatever the
12:56 - app you want to call it so in this case
12:57 - we're going to call it twitter dash
12:58 - clone
12:59 - you don't want to have spaces you want
13:00 - to do dashes instead guys
13:02 - so that will go ahead and actually
13:03 - create the entire starter template
13:07 - with the tool that facebook has given us
13:08 - create react app and basically this just
13:10 - gives you like a perfect starting place
13:11 - so yeah that would take about a few
13:13 - minutes to set up we need to go ahead
13:14 - and do what now cause
13:16 - so here is just a visual of what sunny
13:18 - just talked about and he actually posted
13:20 - this
13:20 - also on his instagram story or instagram
13:23 - post
13:24 - and this is how you can create your own
13:25 - react app so you guys can see it's just
13:27 - like a very simple three-step process
13:29 - and then you just have to do npm start
13:30 - to run it
13:31 - and then boom volume now you have
13:33 - actually created
13:34 - your own react app exactly
13:38 - so really simple guys and if you do
13:39 - forget the steps that we said like cause
13:41 - he said
13:42 - go over to my instagram i've got a post
13:44 - on there which actually shows you all
13:45 - the steps to get that up and running
13:47 - i love what the greatest ever just said
13:49 - he goes i want to thank you guys
13:50 - cuz he goes because lol i have never
13:52 - been in a position where i'm happily
13:54 - turning offers down because i know that
13:57 - what i have recently learned is insanely
13:59 - valuable
14:00 - the that's nice dude i love that
14:04 - that's huge yeah awesome
14:07 - so now it's installing you guys can see
14:09 - at the bottom and we're
14:10 - finishing installing this and then we're
14:12 - going to move into it and
14:13 - should we do the firebase thing right
14:15 - now sunny or do it later yeah
14:17 - let's go ahead and set up firebase right
14:18 - now okay cool help us out
14:20 - so boom let's just jump into and add the
14:24 - firebase
14:25 - okay so guys firebase is just a suite of
14:28 - tools by google
14:30 - and they pretty much allow us to do a
14:32 - bunch of things so in this case we're
14:33 - going to have a database
14:34 - today with firebase and we're also going
14:36 - to have the hosting uh managed by
14:38 - firebase you can you can do
14:39 - authentication you can do a bunch of
14:41 - stuff like that
14:42 - go ahead and check out the amazon clone
14:43 - if you want to check out the
14:44 - authentication
14:45 - side of things but today we're going to
14:46 - be using the database and the hosting
14:48 - so if you guys know if you guys know aws
14:51 - firebase is just aws but a lot easier
14:54 - and simpler
14:55 - yeah it's like the friendly aws yeah
14:58 - that's the simplest way to
14:59 - i think that should be their tagline the
15:02 - friendly
15:03 - aws that's it i think they will kill it
15:06 - exactly they just make it so you only
15:08 - have to do what you need to do like you
15:09 - don't have to any setup or configuration
15:11 - or
15:12 - any headache behind it all you need is a
15:13 - gmail account and you can pretty much
15:15 - get started
15:16 - yeah yeah in the glow says these
15:19 - sessions
15:19 - i have to admit these sessions really
15:21 - show why i love coding and learning to
15:23 - code various clones awesome nice
15:27 - awesome so so i'm opening this up now
15:30 - i'm going to create a add
15:31 - i'm going to add a project okay so make
15:33 - sure you guys do that
15:35 - and then in this project basically i'm
15:37 - going to name it so here guys i'm going
15:39 - to name this project because we're doing
15:40 - twitter clone i'm going to call it
15:42 - twitter clone
15:44 - yep i'm going to hit continue now you
15:46 - don't need to have analytics you can
15:47 - have it disabled or enabled i'm just
15:49 - going to enable it
15:50 - continue and then i'm going to connect
15:52 - it with
15:53 - some analytics account and create
15:55 - project
15:56 - yeah and this will go ahead and set up
15:58 - your project guys
15:59 - once this is done there's a few steps
16:01 - that we need to do
16:03 - to go ahead and grab a config file and
16:05 - now what this config is basically going
16:07 - to allow us to do
16:08 - is pretty much go ahead and connect the
16:09 - react app which is our front end
16:11 - to firebase which is going to act as our
16:13 - back end in this case so
16:15 - firebase is really nice because you
16:16 - don't have to do the traditional back
16:17 - end
16:18 - sort of headache and setup it just does
16:20 - everything super quick so now we could
16:21 - continue

18:07 - learn exactly
18:08 - we always talk about pattern recognition
18:11 - and this is basically where
18:12 - you keep repeating something until you
18:14 - notice the little patterns which kind of
18:15 - appear
18:16 - over and over again so for example by
18:18 - doing these live streams
18:19 - even if it seems like you're not taking
18:21 - in any information

19:49 - than any other institution
19:51 - including schools exactly exactly
19:54 - that's our main mission guys to get as
19:56 - many developers
19:58 - up and running as we possibly can yep
20:01 - so thank you for that all right so now
20:04 - we're up and running and we've cd'ed
20:05 - into this
20:06 - so now sunny what we're gonna be doing
20:08 - is guys get into your twitter clone
20:10 - right over here
20:11 - and also just hit npm start and that
20:14 - should start your app and it should open
20:17 - up your localhost on the right hand side
20:20 - a few other things we're going to do
20:21 - because we kind of do them really really
20:23 - often so i'm just going to go ahead and
20:24 - do them
20:25 - a little bit faster now is
20:28 - we're going to delete some of the stuff
20:30 - we don't need so test
20:32 - app test logo and the setup test we
20:36 - don't need
20:37 - so exactly as soon as our local host
20:39 - starts running we're going to go ahead
20:40 - and delete that
20:41 - romel thank you for another donation
20:43 - really appreciate it
20:45 - yeah we could delete that right now
20:46 - actually it wouldn't break the uh
20:48 - the development so okay cool cool cool
20:51 - let's do it we're gonna go ahead and
20:53 - so there you guys see the at logo is
20:55 - spinning i just wanted them to see the
20:57 - spinning logo you know
20:59 - oh yeah we're gonna go ahead and delete
21:01 - that so now
21:02 - it'll complain because it doesn't know
21:04 - it doesn't know where the logo is
21:06 - anymore it's because we took it out so
21:07 - now we're just gonna go ahead and
21:09 - remove the logo we're gonna hit save and
21:12 - it's still gonna complain a little bit
21:14 - but we're gonna get rid of everything
21:16 - inside of this div okay so i'm gonna
21:19 - grab everything inside of this
21:20 - remove it and uh here instead of
21:23 - anything else we're just gonna replace
21:25 - it with this
21:26 - and we're gonna say hit clever
21:29 - programmers
21:30 - let's build a twitter
21:35 - clone of course i gotta have my rocket
21:38 - emojis
21:39 - hit save and boom it should be up and
21:42 - running there we go
21:43 - now you guys see how it's like
21:44 - centralized um
21:46 - now that's really cool but we want to
21:49 - take that design
21:50 - we want to take that away another thing
21:52 - you guys will see is that there's like
21:53 - this invisible
21:54 - 10 margin that's there in all react apps
21:58 - by default
21:59 - so we want to like get that get rid of
22:01 - that as well
22:02 - so now i'm going to go ahead and do a
22:04 - few things
22:06 - i'm going to go to our css file
22:09 - so we're going to go to app.css and um
22:13 - here i'm gonna just go ahead and remove
22:16 - everything now when i hit save
22:18 - you guys will see that this has you know
22:21 - left a line now and another thing i'm
22:24 - gonna do
22:24 - is it's going to be called
22:28 - we're going to follow the bem convention
22:30 - yeah
22:31 - and over here so following the bem
22:33 - convention
22:34 - this one is going to be lowercase app
22:36 - the class name so i'm going to hit save
22:38 - on that as well
22:39 - sunny go ahead you can take it over i
22:42 - feel like
22:42 - i feel like such a proud dad when you go
22:44 - through those
22:46 - don't let go and carry on nice awesome
22:49 - so
22:50 - with that said guys as once we've done
22:52 - that we've pretty much done the cleanup
22:53 - process
22:54 - and then you want to go over to
22:55 - index.css that's the last step
22:57 - um you just want to um whoa

24:08 - more people
24:10 - exactly right ready so yeah now
24:13 - you see that because you mentioned that
24:15 - 10 pixels sort of like or like little
24:17 - gap above the text right yeah
24:19 - to get rid of that we need to go into
24:21 - index.css
24:23 - index.css the scary place yeah no that's
24:26 - not the same
24:28 - that is this kind of scary place but the
24:31 - really scary place is the index.js
24:34 - i see yeah so now we've got the margin
24:36 - zero and as soon as we hit save guys
24:38 - you'll notice
24:39 - it should snap up right there we go so
24:41 - that's the entire cleanup process done
24:44 - so with that said we can actually go
24:45 - ahead and get started so
24:47 - we notice how in twitter they have
24:50 - pretty much three sections from the page
24:52 - right
24:53 - we have the sidebar we have the middle
24:56 - feed
24:56 - and then we have the sort of widgets on
24:58 - the right hand side
25:00 - so we can actually go ahead and show
25:02 - them this before we kind of jump in so
25:03 - if we look at the actual twitter website
25:05 - we'll see that you um you have a sidebar
25:08 - you have like the middle feed where you
25:10 - kind of scroll through
25:11 - and then you have that widgets on the
25:13 - right right
25:14 - so if we have a look now so you can see
25:16 - that sidebar on the left
25:18 - really clean and the only scrollable
25:20 - thing here guys
25:21 - is that middle feed so we're going to
25:22 - show you how to make it like that but
25:24 - this is the only scrollable thing here
25:26 - by the way exactly
25:29 - yeah keep going that's the that's the
25:31 - only scrollable thing and then we have
25:32 - the widgets on the right
25:34 - so what i like to do is i kind of like
25:36 - to sort of draft things out so let's go
25:37 - ahead and
25:39 - make that half the screen again or
25:40 - actually have a local host up on the
25:42 - right
25:43 - cool so boom right here
25:46 - there we go and what we're going to do
25:48 - now is we i like to use comments to sort
25:50 - of like
25:51 - mark out what we're going to do so the
25:52 - first three things that we're going to
25:54 - build or like the goal of what we're
25:55 - going to build is we're going to have
25:56 - three separate things
25:58 - one is going to be the sidebar that we
26:01 - saw just previously then we're going to
26:03 - have the
26:05 - feed so the feed is that middle uh feed
26:08 - with all the posts inside of it and then
26:09 - we have so just slow down here slow down
26:11 - here so i want to show you guys this
26:12 - okay so when he says sidebar
26:14 - i just want to make it clear like
26:16 - exactly what each of those components
26:18 - he's talking about
26:19 - so yeah uh this will never ex okay so
26:22 - here
26:23 - when you say feed it's this thing here
26:26 - below the
26:27 - top or is it the whole higher including
26:30 - the home
26:31 - yeah so we have components inside of it
26:33 - but we are we are actually calling this
26:34 - entire thing the feed
26:35 - so this thing is the feed so guys when
26:38 - we think react we think in component
26:40 - based terms so here this is going to be
26:42 - the feed okay just so
26:44 - it's extremely clear to you guys next up
26:47 - the thing that's going to be the sidebar
26:50 - is going to be this thing when it
26:52 - expands okay so we're going to be
26:53 - building this thing
26:54 - that when it expands it looks like this
26:56 - so this is going to be
26:58 - the sidebar okay yep and
27:01 - um then
27:04 - oh thank you the greatest ever just
27:06 - actually did another donation
27:08 - really appreciate that i'm gonna pop
27:10 - that up it's 140
27:12 - czar and he says i may not have enough
27:14 - for the course right now because more
27:16 - than my monthly allowance and income but
27:17 - i really wanted to do this for you guys
27:19 - for a long time
27:20 - i cannot begin to thank you enough for
27:22 - what y'all are doing for me
27:24 - massively appreciate that dude we
27:26 - appreciate you so much
27:28 - thank you for being here for all these
27:29 - streams like we love all of you guys for
27:31 - being here and just
27:32 - contributing to the chat and like
27:35 - helping other developers out so thank
27:36 - you
27:37 - exactly thank you so much dude so going
27:39 - back to here right so you guys see the
27:41 - sidebar that we're going to be building
27:44 - and then the widgets where are the
27:45 - widgets so the widgets is that right
27:48 - section so you see where it says what's
27:49 - happening and then we
27:51 - all that stuff on the right and the
27:52 - search bar everything we're going to
27:53 - consider that as widgets
27:55 - cool right so it's like these extra sort
27:57 - of functionality so that side stuff is
27:59 - going to be this so this is how sunny
28:01 - will write out as comments like
28:03 - um components that he's going to be
28:05 - making
28:06 - exactly hopefully yeah and then within
28:09 - these
28:10 - components you can have other components
28:12 - inside of them and so forth until you
28:14 - have like this nice sort of finished
28:15 - product so
28:16 - with that said here's the rough layout
28:18 - so the first thing i think we could
28:19 - build is actually the sidebar because
28:21 - it's quite visually
28:22 - visual and it's easy to sort of see so
28:25 - let's go ahead and do that so i'm going
28:26 - to go ahead and create a file called
28:28 - sidebar.js so because if you want to
28:30 - build the first one
28:31 - and then after that we can go ahead and
28:33 - do it okay so i'm going to go right here
28:34 - to files
28:35 - and i'm going to hit boom new file and
28:37 - we're going to go sidebar dot js like
28:40 - that you guys
28:41 - and that's because it's a component
28:43 - components
28:44 - always have the first letter capital
28:46 - okay
28:47 - yeah exactly and then what we're going
28:50 - to use is we actually use
28:51 - something called es7 snippets which we
28:53 - use in all of our builds
28:55 - and it's an amazing extension which all
28:57 - of you guys should go ahead and install
28:59 - and what it allows us to do is write
29:01 - rfce
29:02 - and actually go ahead and press enter
29:04 - for some reason mine's not popping up
29:06 - right now
29:07 - oh no one's like rfce
29:10 - do i have to write this manually is it
29:14 - coming up for you quasi
29:15 - it's not coming up for me either weird
29:18 - huh
29:18 - extensions let me go to our extensions
29:21 - and
29:22 - it's installed so something weird is
29:25 - happening
29:26 - rfce
29:30 - okay so we might have to actually write
29:31 - this out so
29:33 - uh oh man that's a bummer i love this
29:35 - this is a
29:36 - side this is the sidebar js right yeah
29:39 - so the first thing you're going to have
29:40 - to do is import react from react so
29:43 - that's the first thing you do in any
29:44 - file
29:45 - so we can go ahead and do that so we say
29:46 - import react from react and then we're
29:48 - going to say
29:49 - function where are you where you're
29:50 - writing because i don't see it
29:53 - sidebar.js i'm in there but i didn't see
29:57 - that you wrote it i just wrote it in
29:58 - right now
30:00 - oh really yeah so maybe write some other
30:03 - stuff i want to see if we're out of
30:05 - sync or not yeah i think we're out of
30:07 - sync maybe because i just wrote function
30:09 - sidebar but it hasn't popped in
30:12 - yep don't see it right oh something yeah
30:14 - now i see you're
30:16 - writing weird okay yeah that's really
30:18 - gonna
30:20 - let's go ahead and check so function
30:21 - sidebar
30:23 - what about now okay we're good all right
30:25 - i think we're good
30:26 - cool cool for it yeah so function
30:29 - sidebar and then what this will do is it
30:30 - will return some
30:31 - uh jsx right so return some stuff inside
30:34 - of here
30:34 - and then we need to do x4 default
30:37 - and we're going to say export default
30:39 - sidebar right so that's going to allow
30:41 - us to actually use that
30:42 - outside of the sidebar then we're going
30:44 - to have a div inside of it and this is
30:45 - going to have the class name of sidebar
30:48 - so i'm going to go ahead and do that
30:49 - there we go and then inside of here guys
30:52 - we had that sidebar so let's go ahead
30:54 - and just draft out some of the things
30:56 - that we saw
30:56 - so we had at the top of it we had
30:58 - something like a twitter icon so we had
31:00 - a twitter icon at the top
31:01 - and then we had a few other things so we
31:03 - had a bunch of options right we had like
31:05 - the home button the explore button the
31:07 - notifications the messages bookmarks
31:09 - list profile
31:10 - all those sort of options on the side
31:12 - and what i'm going to do here is
31:13 - actually go ahead and create
31:15 - something like this so it's going to be
31:16 - a sidebar option component
31:18 - and then we're just gonna repeat it so
31:20 - we're gonna have several of them right
31:22 - and then at the end of it we had a
31:24 - buttons which said tweet so we had a
31:26 - button
31:26 - which was pretty much just had tweet on
31:30 - it right and that was styled in the way
31:31 - that we expected it to be
31:33 - and then what we're going to do is
31:34 - anytime we create a component
31:36 - i'm going to go ahead and do import and
31:39 - i'm going to import the appropriate
31:40 - css file so in this case import sidebar
31:43 - dot css
31:45 - i'm going to go ahead and create that
31:46 - file so sidebar dot css
31:49 - and i'm going to basically click enter
31:51 - and we should be in that file
31:52 - in just a second so now you should see
31:54 - yes there we go
31:56 - awesome so that's pretty much the uh the
31:59 - sidebar roughly set up to a degree
32:01 - so what we're going to do now is
32:02 - actually go ahead and code what we need
32:04 - to code so
32:05 - the first thing guys is that twitter
32:07 - icon the twitter icon that we see
32:09 - how can we actually get those icons
32:11 - quite simply and what we're going to be
32:12 - using today is material ui
32:14 - so what we need to do is we need to go
32:16 - ahead and install that into the project
32:18 - so
32:18 - posie let's run through the installation
32:20 - of material ui
32:21 - and material ui icons
32:26 - say that again again so now we need to
32:28 - install material ui
32:30 - ui icon yeah and what this will allow us
32:34 - to do guys so material ui
32:35 - is like a design library right it allows
32:37 - us to have loads of these beautiful
32:38 - components
32:39 - but as well it gives us these icon sets
32:42 - so you get pretty much get all the icons
32:43 - you even get the twitter icon
32:45 - uh you get nice really nice buttons you
32:48 - get which which have that nice ripple
32:49 - effect when you press it
32:51 - all those things come included with
32:52 - material ui so we're going to go ahead
32:54 - and uh yeah make sure you'll see this is
32:56 - how you guys are gonna install this by
32:58 - the way you guys so make sure you do
33:00 - material ui
33:01 - core this is installation and if you're
33:03 - using
33:04 - not react then this is how you're gonna
33:06 - install it but because we are using
33:07 - react
33:08 - this is our install now once we're
33:11 - inside of here
33:12 - make sure you guys go to icons because
33:14 - we're going to be using material
33:15 - ui for the icons okay so that twitter
33:18 - icon that other home icon the explorer
33:20 - one
33:21 - so i'll show you guys for example
33:25 - another important thing is once you're
33:26 - on material icons here
33:29 - um make sure to click where it says
33:31 - search the full list of these icons
33:33 - okay click that get inside of here and
33:36 - now it's going to give you the overall
33:38 - all the icons that are available at your
33:40 - disposal
33:41 - yeah once you're in here give it a
33:44 - second to pop up
33:46 - jesse joseph says kazi i'm so thankful
33:48 - for all
33:49 - you have been doing on your channel with
33:51 - your channel i've been able to
33:52 - completely transform my life
33:55 - thanks a lot once again dude
33:58 - that is sick thank you man thank you and
34:00 - the greatest ever just said this right
34:02 - here was such a lifesaver as well i've
34:05 - seen a few comments like that we're
34:06 - really glad that we can provide you guys
34:08 - with value
34:09 - that changes your life in that sense so
34:10 - amazing to see
34:12 - well what is the hashtag one called dude
34:14 - why isn't it coming up when i type in
34:15 - hashtag yeah
34:16 - they don't even have a hashtag one which
34:18 - kind of blew my mind uh
34:19 - we had to use something we had to use
34:21 - the search icon for that one instead but
34:23 - let's go ahead and type
34:24 - maybe type in like a home okay cool yeah
34:27 - so let's say i don't know so i couldn't
34:30 - find
34:31 - yeah so boom we got home right here
34:33 - right this is how you're going to be
34:34 - able to look up all your icons now once
34:36 - you're like hey i want to cop this i'm
34:37 - going to use this in my app click it
34:39 - boom here's your code and then you can
34:42 - use this and just
34:43 - pop it into your own app okay so it's as
34:45 - easy as that
34:46 - so that's how you're going to use
34:48 - material ui
34:50 - and make sure you also install the icons
34:53 - you guys
34:53 - so that's another important step so what
34:56 - you can do
34:56 - is copy this this is the one you need
35:00 - okay and now i'm going to have
35:03 - our command line here and basically what
35:05 - you want to do is npm i
35:07 - and then just paste it you remember guys
35:09 - you don't need to use dash
35:10 - dash save anymore ever
35:13 - again it automatically saves it so this
35:16 - is a weird thing that most people don't
35:18 - know about
35:18 - but that blew my mind when you told me
35:20 - that
35:22 - yeah most people didn't know about this
35:24 - i learned it and i was like yo son did
35:25 - you know this he's like what
35:27 - yeah i had no idea dude i don't think
35:30 - that's that same for years
35:32 - yeah i mean i didn't know about npmi
35:35 - yeah i was like how many shortcuts are
35:37 - these guys going to make what's going to
35:38 - be next ni
35:40 - yeah exactly i think all my zsh
35:45 - yeah so there you guys go this is how
35:47 - you can install
35:48 - so now you want to use those icons it's
35:50 - just as simple as that like little
35:51 - import at the top and then you're good
35:53 - to go with the icons okay
35:55 - awesome nice so with that said guys the
35:58 - way we use it now because we just
36:00 - installed all the dependencies
36:02 - we go ahead and we go to the import on
36:03 - line three and we can pretty much go
36:05 - ahead and pop it in there we say
36:06 - import twitter icon from material ui
36:10 - icons twitter hold up hold up we can't
36:12 - see you
36:13 - wait where were you writing oh i see it
36:15 - nevermind yeah we're good yeah
36:17 - so we pretty much go ahead and do import
36:19 - twitter icon from material ui icons for
36:21 - slash twitter
36:23 - and basically in order to use it it's
36:25 - very simple you pretty much go here
36:26 - you do twitter icon and then you pretty
36:28 - much just do four slash right and as
36:30 - soon as we hit save on that
36:32 - we actually need to actually pull this
36:33 - in so right now yes we have we are using
36:35 - the twitter icon but we don't render the
36:36 - sidebar anywhere
36:38 - so i need to go ahead and go to app.js
36:41 - and where we had the sidebar comment and
36:42 - you can see the comments actually really
36:44 - help you out because they sort of give
36:45 - you like an outline right
36:46 - let me go ahead and save this and then
36:48 - it says sidebar is not defined so in at
36:51 - the top we need to say
36:52 - import sidebar from
36:55 - sidebar yep and then i'm going to click
36:57 - save
36:58 - and now what we should see is it should
37:01 - do a hot reload
37:03 - and on the right it should be popping up
37:05 - so if we click save
37:07 - cyber is not defined yep i think it's
37:09 - just boom
37:10 - nice nice so that little
37:13 - icon is actually coming from the sidebar
37:16 - component because the components being
37:17 - rendered out and it's giving us a tour
37:19 - icon which is really nice
37:21 - so after the twitter icon it's the home
37:22 - icon right
37:24 - yeah so we have a bunch of this is where
37:27 - component based design comes in right we
37:29 - have a bunch of like options which all
37:31 - look the same right
37:32 - they all look the same they all have the
37:34 - same sort of hovering over functionality
37:36 - so rather than writing the same code all
37:38 - like over here when you say they all
37:40 - have hovering over functionality let's
37:42 - just visualize that so this is what he
37:44 - means by it guys you see how
37:45 - when i hover over it it turns blue so
37:48 - that's what we're talking about okay
37:50 - keep going yeah
37:51 - exactly that so that's um that's what we
37:53 - mean when we say that so in order to get
37:55 - that working guys
37:56 - what we're going to do is we're going to
37:57 - go ahead and create sidebar option
37:59 - components so i'm going to create a file
38:01 - called cyberoption.js
38:04 - and we should be popping into that file
38:06 - and now
38:07 - and you can see we're inside there now
38:09 - i'm going to do rfce and hopefully
38:12 - before you make this let me just clarify
38:14 - a few things okay
38:16 - so first thing is this thing that you're
38:20 - making right now this is
38:21 - going to be when you say sidebar options
38:23 - what do you mean by that
38:24 - right so can you uh if you open up the
38:26 - twitter
38:27 - app you'll be able to see on the sidebar
38:30 - so let's go ahead and make it a little
38:32 - bigger you should be able to see on that
38:34 - sidebar you've got home
38:35 - with an icon you've got explore with an
38:37 - icon notifications with nikon messages
38:39 - and each one guys is the exact same in
38:41 - terms of design
38:43 - the only difference here is the icon and
38:45 - the text
38:46 - but everything renders out the same
38:48 - right even the way we hover over it
38:50 - has the same effect when we do that so
38:53 - what we're going to do is
38:54 - we're going to create one component
38:55 - called sidebar option
38:57 - and then we're going to customize it
38:58 - with props got it
39:00 - and that thing is gonna do what that
39:02 - thing is gonna do so if i have sidebar
39:04 - let me just write sidebar options here
39:06 - and
39:07 - functionality wise what that's gonna add
39:09 - is that on hover
39:10 - on hover turn blue yep so
39:14 - turn blue will give it a nice little
39:15 - background color and it's going to be
39:17 - more of a sort of in this in this demo
39:19 - it's going to be just purely sort of a
39:20 - ui
39:21 - component so it's just going to be
39:22 - something which looks nice on the side
39:24 - but we're going to show you how to
39:25 - handle it and style it and do everything
39:27 - to get it looking like you see it right
39:29 - there got it so is it going to be using
39:31 - also like flexbox to add in the spacing
39:33 - between the
39:34 - icon and the text as well um yeah so
39:37 - actually when we when we stack up here
39:39 - we don't use flexbox but you see where
39:41 - we've got the sidebar we've got the feed
39:43 - and the widgets
39:44 - there's plenty of flexbox to get that to
39:46 - be achieved and is that going to be
39:47 - inside of sidebar options or no
39:50 - uh in sidebar options we we do need to
39:53 - actually add a flex
39:55 - rule but we'll cover that when we get to
39:58 - that bit yeah
39:59 - okay got it cool so sidebar options wise
40:02 - i mean overall it's just hovered on
40:05 - hover it's going to turn blue
40:07 - and any other functionality that i can i
40:09 - should list out here
40:11 - yeah so we're going to show you how to
40:13 - actually pass a component
40:15 - as a prop so we're used to passing
40:17 - things like text through props or
40:19 - numbers and things like that but here
40:20 - we're going to show you actually how you
40:21 - can pass an entire
40:23 - component as a prop as well so a lot of
40:24 - people didn't know you could do that
40:26 - i'm going to show you how to do that
40:27 - today okay dope
40:29 - yeah and that component guys that we're
40:32 - going to be passing through is the icon
40:33 - itself
40:34 - right so that's how we have different
40:35 - icons got it
40:37 - so right now we're going to work on the
40:38 - sidebar options
40:40 - yep so it's going to be the sidebar
40:41 - options
40:43 - okay exactly cool nice
40:47 - so with that said guys let's go and hop
40:49 - into the sidebar options right so
40:52 - sidebar option is going to have a class
40:54 - name so let's go ahead and show the code
40:56 - editor
41:01 - there we go awesome so we have div and
41:04 - we have a class name
41:05 - and here we have class name i'm going to
41:07 - go ahead and do sidebar option
41:09 - like this right because we're using the
41:10 - bem naming convention and inside of here
41:12 - what we're going to do is we
41:13 - like for now just to get everything sort
41:15 - of tested and see if it's working
41:17 - let's go ahead and just pass in like
41:19 - this is
41:20 - an option right just to sort of see if
41:22 - it's working
41:24 - uh so i'm going to go ahead and click
41:25 - save and before we do that i'm going to
41:26 - go ahead and create the css file for
41:28 - this so i'm going to say import
41:29 - i'm going to say sidebar option.css
41:33 - like this and i'm going to go ahead and
41:36 - create that file
41:37 - and say sidebar option.css
41:40 - awesome there we go and now
41:44 - guys we have this is an option and then
41:46 - in order to use this now so just as an
41:48 - example i'm going to pull it in here so
41:49 - here we have all of our comments
41:51 - the sidebar option but i'm going to go
41:52 - ahead and do sidebar
41:55 - option like this but we need to import
41:58 - it so i'm going to go ahead and do
42:01 - this i'm going to say import sidebar
42:05 - option from
42:09 - cyber option option yep like that and
42:12 - that will go ahead and pull it in and
42:14 - now if i
42:14 - duplicate this like four times for
42:16 - example and save it
42:18 - we should see now on the right side we
42:20 - should say i am an option i am an option
42:21 - i am not
42:22 - so this is an option four times perfect
42:24 - yep yep
42:25 - right so the next step is all about sort
42:28 - of how do we address
42:29 - passing through props so here so i see
42:32 - what you're saying with the props so
42:33 - basically like you can actually pass it
42:35 - in a prop like you can pass it in
42:38 - uh pass it an icon yeah
42:41 - so you guys exactly like how for your
42:43 - functions right for those of you guys
42:45 - who are not that familiar with
42:47 - react when you guys have your own
42:49 - functions
42:50 - you guys have to pass in arguments for
42:52 - those functions
42:53 - like if you have a function that adds up
42:54 - two numbers you need
42:56 - number one and number two in this case
42:59 - when you're doing building components in
43:02 - this sidebar option you can actually
43:04 - pass it literally an icon as an argument
43:06 - in the function it's kind of like that
43:08 - and then it'll you know show that icon
43:11 - you could
43:12 - also pass it styling and then it can
43:15 - actually
43:16 - use that styling which is kind of really
43:19 - it's
43:20 - it's a functional way of front end
43:24 - yeah that's a really fun thing to do
43:27 - exactly guys and then uh so we're gonna
43:29 - pass it icons and we're also gonna pass
43:31 - it uh text exactly and we pass it
43:35 - through with the prop so what we can do
43:37 - here is use es6 and basically
43:39 - break apart the object at this point and
43:42 - say we're going to
43:42 - go ahead and receive some text right so
43:45 - that's cause you mentioned that's one of
43:46 - the props
43:47 - and then we're going to have an icon
43:48 - right but remember guys if we're passing
43:50 - in an icon which is a component
43:53 - in react we need every single component
43:55 - has a capital letter right
43:57 - so we have to use a capital i right so
44:00 - in this case because icon will be a
44:02 - component we have to pass in with a
44:03 - capital i
44:04 - so in order to render that component
44:06 - once we pass it in so
44:08 - to use the text that we passed through i
44:09 - can go ahead and go here
44:11 - and i can use these curly brackets which
44:13 - actually allows us do you like
44:15 - my uh do you like my text on that those
44:18 - squiggly
44:19 - structuring don't get intimidated by
44:22 - those guys
44:22 - exactly nice so in order to
44:25 - actually use that properly we add the
44:27 - curly braces uh the squiggly brackets
44:29 - and then we add text
44:31 - all right and that will go ahead and
44:32 - pull that variable into our html
44:34 - right there so that's jsx right there
44:37 - and then we'll show the icon in a second
44:38 - but i just want to demonstrate this bit
44:40 - first so inside of sidebar now
44:42 - we can go ahead and do this we can say
44:43 - text equals in this case we could do
44:45 - text equals
44:46 - let's say home so text equals home uh
44:50 - and then the next one we could do
44:51 - text equals explore for example
44:55 - and then oops explore and then the next
44:57 - one we can say text
44:59 - equals notifications right
45:02 - awesome and then we can just show free
45:04 - for now so like this have three and if i
45:06 - save it
45:07 - here you can see it passed through we've
45:09 - got home explorer notifications
45:11 - so that's really nice right now we have
45:14 - different icons for these things right
45:17 - so let's go ahead
45:18 - and we can pass in an icon and the icon
45:21 - that we're going to use for the home is
45:22 - actually something called home icon so
45:24 - i'm going to go ahead and import this
45:26 - and we found this from material ui
45:27 - through the method that we showed you
45:29 - earlier
45:30 - so i home icon all you need to do is
45:32 - pass that entire
45:33 - component through as a prop right and
45:36 - i'll show you how we use it in a second
45:38 - and the next one for the explore what we
45:40 - need to do
45:41 - is we go ahead and grab the search icon
45:44 - so here i do this
45:45 - so search icon so i go ahead and grab it
45:48 - from here
45:49 - and the next one after this is if we do
45:51 - icon
45:52 - equals let's go ahead and do this and we
45:55 - say
45:56 - icon equals the notifications
45:59 - none icon so it's a bit of a strange
46:01 - name but for this one
46:03 - i need to go ahead and grab this so
46:06 - notifications
46:07 - none icon there we go awesome and then
46:10 - what we need to do is we're passing in
46:11 - the icons now but are we actually
46:13 - rendering it so if we go ahead and look
46:14 - inside the component we're not rendering
46:16 - it so
46:16 - here i need to say icon yeah and you
46:19 - notice how it's
46:20 - green which means that it's a it's a
46:22 - component because it has a capital
46:24 - letter if i did lowercase
46:25 - see how it's blue that's because it's
46:27 - not a component right if we use a
46:29 - capital i
46:30 - it knows it's a component and it also is
46:32 - using the component that we pass through
46:34 - to dynamically generate that so as soon
46:37 - as i hit
46:38 - save now we'll see something really nice
46:40 - we should see
46:41 - all the icons pop in awesome
46:46 - so there they are they all come through
46:47 - guys which is really really nice
46:50 - um then what we're going to do is we
46:52 - need to go ahead and style it because
46:54 - right now that's not the prettiest thing
46:56 - uh
46:57 - that we want uh so we're gonna basically
46:59 - go ahead and firstly i'm gonna go ahead
47:00 - and add
47:01 - the rest of the sidebar options so i've
47:03 - got them all over here so i'm gonna go
47:05 - ahead
47:06 - and replace this with this so i need to
47:08 - do a bunch of imports here
47:10 - to get this so there's a few more
47:13 - imports i'm going to go ahead and grab
47:15 - so let's go ahead and do that there we
47:17 - go and as soon as i hit
47:18 - save
47:22 - and i saw a question which says hey
47:24 - sonny why do we store some functions in
47:26 - a variable type constant others not
47:28 - so guys that's pretty much an es6 uh es6
47:32 - way of writing a function so you could
47:33 - write a function like this or you could
47:34 - do const
47:35 - oops or you could do const sidebar
47:39 - equals an arrow function like this this
47:41 - exact same thing you're pretty much
47:42 - wearing a function
47:43 - that this is a more declarative way of
47:45 - doing it for some people
47:47 - uh so it's pretty much down to
47:48 - preference so
47:50 - you just need to know that that is the

48:00 - are here because you want to learn these
48:02 - skills that's number one i imagine
48:04 - number two is you want to learn these
48:06 - skills for what
48:08 - do you want to just learn these skills
48:10 - for a hobby or do you want to actually

49:47 - super value-packed and free all right
49:49 - guys
49:49 - let's get back to the training awesome
49:52 - so
49:53 - guys we just showed how we had the
49:54 - sidebar options that we pretty much went
49:56 - ahead and imported
49:57 - in and we can now see on the right hand
49:59 - side they all come in but they don't
50:01 - look great right they don't look like
50:02 - the finished product that we want
50:04 - so in this case what i'm going to go
50:05 - ahead and do is actually go ahead and
50:08 - style this so we did create a sidebar
50:10 - option.css
50:11 - file so i've gone ahead and given this a
50:14 - sidebar option class so before what
50:16 - we're going to do now is i'm going to go
50:18 - to
50:18 - sidebar option.css and i'm going to do
50:20 - the following i'm going to say
50:22 - 4 sidebar options so for that container
50:24 - i'm going to do display
50:26 - flex so display flex
50:29 - oops oh my rocket's firing off yeah
50:32 - display flex
50:33 - and then if i save that we should see
50:35 - everything will pop snap
50:37 - into the middle so it should snap really
50:39 - nicely into the middle there
50:40 - um there we go so it's all popped into
50:43 - the middle but
50:44 - the alignment you can't actually tell
50:46 - right now but the alignment's slightly
50:47 - off so we need to align
50:48 - item center and that will make sure that
50:50 - everything's vertically aligned
50:52 - perfectly so as soon as i do that
50:54 - you see the icons just came down a
50:56 - little bit right yeah
50:57 - really important to do that and then
50:59 - also we want it so that whenever you
51:00 - hover over
51:01 - them we want the cursor to change to a
51:03 - pointer
51:04 - right and the reason why we want to do
51:06 - that is because it's just a really nice
51:08 - user experience
51:09 - so let me so remove the pointer just so
51:11 - i can show this
51:12 - to all the people who are as dumb as me
51:15 - when it comes to front end
51:16 - so look guys ugh like when i'm over the
51:18 - bookmark and all this it's just
51:20 - weird right but if i go to actual
51:21 - twitter you see it turns into a pointer
51:24 - as soon as i hover over it
51:25 - and it's so simple to do that with css
51:27 - it's kind of crazy i mean with back end
51:29 - you have to program
51:30 - everything but here just do this now
51:33 - uncomment it real quick
51:34 - and watch what happens as soon as i'm
51:36 - hovering on it boom
51:38 - pointer pointer pointer exactly and the
51:40 - reason why that's so important guys is
51:42 - because as a user it then tells them
51:43 - that that's actually something they can
51:45 - click
51:46 - right without that it's very hard to
51:47 - know that thanks so much the
51:49 - yeah you were gonna just say that right

53:10 - about 10 000 likes actually damn it's
53:12 - going up let's go
53:15 - all right let's keep going awesome so
53:17 - and now what we're going to do guys
53:18 - is we are going to have it so that we
53:21 - need to target those
53:23 - elements right so the material ui
53:25 - elements and now material ui actually
53:27 - goes ahead
53:28 - and adds a class of its own to those
53:31 - icons and what that class
53:32 - is is this one right here so it's
53:34 - material ui svg icon dash root
53:36 - and i found that through inspecting so
53:39 - what we're going to do
53:40 - is i'm basically saying inside of
53:42 - sidebar option if
53:43 - you find a child which is this so the
53:45 - icon go ahead and give it a padding of
53:47 - 20 pixels padding of 20 pixels
53:49 - and as soon as i hit save small little
53:51 - changes like this make all the
53:53 - difference guys so look as soon as i hit
53:54 - save
53:55 - now it's got immediate spacing right
53:57 - because it's got a really nice immediate
53:58 - spacing
53:59 - flexbox has allowed it to like uh just
54:02 - keep
54:02 - sort of central in their room hey we
54:04 - just hit
54:05 - 1 000 likes thank you guys so much
54:08 - exactly one zero zero zero
54:11 - really appreciate you guys amazing
54:14 - awesome love it all right
54:18 - so now guys what we're gonna do is we
54:20 - are actually gonna have
54:21 - uh we need to style that text a little
54:23 - bit so i'm going to say
54:24 - wherever we have a sidebar option which
54:26 - has a
54:27 - h2 tag underneath it so a direct child
54:29 - which is a h2 tag
54:31 - then i'm going to go ahead and say give
54:32 - it a font weight of 800
54:34 - a font size of 20 pixels and a margin
54:36 - right
54:37 - of 20 pixels so if i go ahead and do
54:39 - this i'm going to
54:41 - save it and we should see the text will
54:43 - change it became a lot smaller right it
54:45 - had this
54:46 - nice sort of it tightened everything up
54:48 - really nicely
54:49 - yeah and now what we're going to do is i
54:51 - want it so that when i hover
54:52 - over it we get that nice hover effect
54:54 - right so in order to do that we say
54:57 - target the sidebar option container but
55:00 - add the
55:00 - hover property and now what we're going
55:02 - to say is whenever we hover over it
55:04 - this is one the background color that
55:06 - they use for that hover
55:08 - uh yeah when i hover over it now nothing
55:11 - is happening
55:12 - but it will soon be the one where when i
55:14 - hover over it it'll show me colors like
55:16 - that
55:17 - exactly okay so now if you hover over it
55:20 - go ahead and check that out you should
55:22 - see now
55:23 - that we should get over look at that
55:25 - that is slick
55:26 - boy and all of that is happening from
55:29 - that one line right here
55:31 - exactly damn what happening for that one
55:35 - love it and then what you notice is that
55:37 - like in twitter
55:38 - it's not like a flat square that kind of
55:41 - comes around it's got a border radius so
55:42 - it's like a nice little curvature to it
55:45 - so i'm going to go ahead and give that
55:46 - border radius of 30 pixels right
55:48 - then i'm going to basically say i want
55:50 - so now we want the text
55:52 - color to change right but we're going to
55:54 - be using the twitter blue
55:56 - throughout the app right so this is
55:57 - something new that we haven't done on a
55:59 - live stream before
56:00 - but basically we use the twitter blue
56:02 - throughout the entire app so
56:03 - rather than me remembering what the
56:05 - color for twitter blue is
56:07 - instead what i'm going to do now is i'm
56:08 - going to go to app.css and i'm going to
56:10 - go ahead and add our first
56:12 - global variable so i'm going to say
56:14 - these global variables apply
56:16 - anywhere inside the body and i'm going
56:18 - to say i'm going to go ahead and add a
56:19 - twitter
56:20 - so this is how you do it inside of css
56:21 - you say twitter color
56:23 - oops twitter color and the twitter color
56:26 - i have the hexadecimal color for it here
56:28 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this and
56:30 - now we have a variable called twitter
56:32 - color
56:33 - which basically resembles the color of
56:34 - twill so instead of remembering it i
56:37 - just go ahead and use this variable
56:38 - and i'm going to also do one for the
56:40 - background color of twitter
56:42 - which is here because we don't want to
56:44 - keep remembering this and i pulled this
56:45 - from the actual css variables are fancy
56:48 - now we can just use this whenever and
56:51 - then be good to go
56:52 - exactly and if i want to use the css
56:54 - variable in another css file like
56:56 - index.css how can i do that you have to
56:58 - import it
57:00 - no so there's like a kind of you it
57:02 - knows that because we're doing this
57:04 - we're applying this to the body scope
57:06 - so we're saying that these uh these
57:08 - variables exist within the entire body
57:10 - so right now well you can you can have
57:12 - it more granular but this is saying that
57:14 - these will exist throughout the entire
57:15 - body
57:16 - so in this case what i'm going to do is
57:18 - because i want them to be global right i
57:19 - want to be
57:20 - used usable for out so in this case what
57:23 - we can say is
57:24 - when we go to uh the hover over the
57:27 - cyber option
57:28 - i want the color of the text to be we
57:30 - say var
57:31 - to target the variable and i just say
57:33 - twitter color
57:35 - that's it and it will use the twitter
57:38 - color
57:39 - and that's super nice guys and what's
57:40 - powerful about this is that whenever we
57:43 - sort of do that and i kind of want to
57:44 - add a transition as well so before i
57:46 - carry on and add a little transition to
57:47 - say
57:48 - whenever the color changes give it 100
57:49 - milliseconds and ease out of that
57:51 - transition
57:53 - and the reason why this is really useful
57:55 - guys and quite nice because if you go
57:56 - ahead and hover over it now
57:58 - check out what those small little
58:00 - changes did
58:01 - all right i'm pumped oh my god that is
58:05 - just so delicious i can [ __ ] eat this
58:08 - thing
58:10 - small little changes and the good thing
58:12 - with this guys is say for example
58:14 - twitter one day changed
58:16 - all of their color schemes that twitter
58:17 - was no longer blue it was green
58:19 - right as soon as they changed that
58:21 - variable right
58:23 - or the value of that variable where it
58:24 - wherever it's declared
58:26 - every single place where it's used will
58:28 - then have that new color so that's why
58:30 - it's really really powerful to go ahead
58:32 - and use css variables so if you haven't
58:34 - already
58:35 - yeah i have a so you don't need this
58:37 - color right anymore
58:39 - um background color no no that's a
58:41 - different one that's actually the
58:42 - difference so how come when i comment
58:43 - this
58:44 - out it still looks the same no so if you
58:47 - hover over it you see the color of the
58:49 - text doesn't change
58:50 - but if you if you add the twitter color
58:51 - back now
58:53 - so oh
58:56 - nice okay i see i see the difference now
59:00 - with that okay
59:01 - and then this transition makes go ahead
59:03 - yep
59:04 - steve mccarthy just said suddenly you
59:05 - can add a default after
59:07 - that for when another color in the
59:09 - variable isn't available i didn't know
59:10 - that thank you yeah i'll actually go
59:12 - ahead and play with that so
59:13 - i have i'm starting to dive a bit more
59:15 - into css variables so the more we kind
59:16 - of do these tutorials we can actually go
59:18 - ahead and mess around with those more
59:19 - nice here we are yep awesome so
59:22 - manish says i want to enroll to
59:24 - javascript program but for some reason
59:26 - payment page is throwing some error i
59:27 - can't complete the payment
59:29 - just send me a just send me or sonny a
59:32 - dm
59:33 - on our instagram right here and we will
59:36 - help you out we'll get on a call with
59:38 - you with that said right here transition
59:40 - guys if you take a look at it
59:42 - if i remove if i remove this transition
59:45 - comment it out look at that when i hover
59:46 - over it
59:47 - it looks good but it almost feels like
59:48 - there's something missing to make it
59:50 - give it that juicy feeling that like
59:53 - maybe you feel on
59:54 - twitter where it just is the slick
59:57 - slickness
59:58 - and um as soon as we add this transition
60:01 - in
60:02 - and add in that like 100 millisecond
60:05 - animation it just looks so nice that's
60:08 - awesome you guys could write it two ways
60:10 - you could write it as hundred
60:11 - milliseconds or i think 0.1
60:13 - seconds as well should work yeah
60:16 - both the same oh yeah you can do it that
60:18 - way as well yeah yeah
60:19 - cool all right go for it awesome so you
60:22 - see guys
60:23 - very few tweaks there to make it look
60:25 - quite like super super slick right and
60:26 - now we've got a reusable component does
60:28 - everything we need it to do
60:29 - that's really really nice now what we're
60:31 - going to do next
60:32 - is we kind of want to have an active
60:34 - state right and the way we usually do
60:36 - this
60:37 - is we usually pass in a prop like this
60:39 - which is which is just
60:40 - active right and in this case what we're
60:42 - going to say is just the first one
60:44 - should have an active sort of uh
60:46 - variable whereas the other ones aren't
60:48 - going to be active
60:49 - and what we're going to do is we're
60:50 - going to target that and we're going to
60:51 - say if you're active
60:52 - and the way we do that we basically go
60:54 - ahead we add some jsx here
60:56 - we get rid of the normal quotes and we
60:58 - give back ticks because we want to do
60:59 - some string interpolation
61:01 - and here i'm going to say if you're
61:03 - active so if there's an active prop that
61:05 - has been passed through
61:06 - then go ahead and add the following so
61:08 - go ahead and add the following so i'm
61:10 - going to say add
61:11 - sidebar option so sidebar option oops
61:14 - upside
61:15 - option underscore underscore active
61:17 - right or in bem
61:19 - what you can actually go ahead and do is
61:20 - use bem so bem the correct way of doing
61:22 - this
61:23 - is you have a modifier so you do this
61:25 - you say dash dash active
61:27 - because we're modifying the state of
61:29 - sidebar option which is actually a
61:30 - really cool
61:31 - thing to show here so we go ahead save
61:33 - that and it's pretty fired it onto the
61:35 - same line
61:36 - and then what we can go ahead and do is
61:37 - go and target this so sidebar active
61:40 - inside of sidebar options and we can
61:41 - pretty much go ahead and say
61:43 - if you're active then we want the color
61:46 - of the text what are we trying to do
61:48 - sunny
61:49 - like what are we functionality was
61:50 - trying to achieve no coding stuff
61:53 - yeah so functionality wise whenever you
61:55 - sort of land on the home
61:56 - on the twitter like home screen for
61:59 - example
62:00 - by default you see the twitter ico the
62:02 - home icon is lit up blue because it's
62:03 - active ah
62:04 - yep it's active i see yeah so whenever
62:07 - you're going to different pages you want
62:08 - that one to have the active prop so
62:10 - we're showing
62:11 - you how to set that up as and have it by
62:13 - default as the home page
62:14 - got it okay awesome yeah because right
62:17 - now in our app we don't have any active
62:19 - props so
62:20 - by default home should be active exactly
62:23 - exactly so in this case as soon as i do
62:25 - that and i click save
62:27 - now we should see the home icon is
62:29 - actually becoming active because it got
62:31 - past the active prop
62:32 - so by default now that that one's going
62:34 - to be highlighted as blue so we already
62:36 - got that nice functionality
62:37 - everything works very slick so that's
62:40 - awesome
62:41 - the next thing we need to do inside of
62:42 - sidebar is we need to go
62:45 - to so let's go ahead and remove our
62:46 - command here now we need to go to the
62:48 - button right so we need a button here
62:51 - so what i'm going to go ahead and do is
62:52 - i'm going to use a material ui button
62:54 - and all the differences is it's just
62:56 - literally a capital b instead of a
62:58 - normal b
62:59 - material ui and then i don't know why it
63:01 - does this annoying issue
63:02 - let's go ahead and do this and then the
63:03 - button is just going to say tweet
63:05 - right tweet and i need to import it from
63:07 - material ui so i'm going to go ahead and
63:09 - do that up at the top
63:11 - so to import it i go ahead and paste the
63:13 - following so i need to go ahead and do
63:14 - this
63:15 - because i think you need to scroll a
63:17 - little bit to the left
63:21 - there we go so we've got import material
63:23 - important button from material ui core
63:25 - and then here you can see that we we
63:26 - have a button so for example if i save
63:28 - it now
63:29 - you'll see that a button should have
63:31 - popped in on the uh
63:33 - bottom left so if i save
63:36 - let's go ahead and save and show button
63:37 - should after it hot reloads it should
63:39 - say tweet on the bottom left
63:41 - [Music]
63:43 - it's quite slow sometimes when it does
63:45 - the hot reloading that's right there you
63:46 - can see there it's got tweet
63:48 - yeah so with that said now we want a
63:50 - variant which is basically a different
63:52 - style that is provided by uh material ui
63:55 - and this one's called outlined and this
63:57 - will change the look and feel of that
63:58 - button
63:59 - so it will now pop up with a outline
64:01 - looks which is a bit more flat a bit
64:03 - more cleaner
64:04 - and it's sort of what we want to go with
64:06 - and we're going to give it a class name
64:07 - because i want to style it so i'm going
64:08 - to give it a class name of sidebar
64:11 - i'm going to just call it tweet right
64:13 - because it's the tweet button
64:14 - and then i'm also it also has another
64:16 - property called full width
64:17 - and full width is built into you know
64:19 - where you're writing oh okay
64:21 - yeah as soon as you start going across
64:23 - like that just let me know so i can
64:25 - follow you because other
64:26 - because otherwise it doesn't show to
64:27 - anybody oh yeah yeah i'll definitely
64:29 - keep an eye on it
64:31 - nice so full width then you can see now
64:33 - the tweet button spans across right
64:35 - but obviously we need that button to
64:37 - look a lot more
64:38 - like it does on the actual um
64:42 - on the actual twitter website right so
64:44 - if we now go over to our sidebar.css
64:47 - we can target this sidebar tweet right
64:50 - so if i go to sidebar css
64:52 - and actually go ahead and target this
64:54 - what i can do now is i can actually go
64:56 - ahead and add the following so i want it
64:58 - to be a background i want the background
64:59 - color of the button
65:00 - to be the twitter color so i can use our
65:02 - variable
65:03 - and i need to give it uh this important
65:07 - tag right so it's question mark
65:08 - important and basically that's because
65:09 - we're overriding
65:11 - the material ui theme so basically as
65:13 - soon as i do that
65:14 - you see the tweet comes in right yeah
65:16 - there's a few other things
65:18 - we don't want a border we want the color
65:19 - of the text to be white
65:21 - and i want the font weight to be a
65:22 - little bold so i'm going to go ahead and
65:24 - add the following
65:25 - so these do those things exactly so as
65:27 - soon as i save that
65:28 - uh you'll see the tweet comes in now
65:30 - what is this for this tweet thing
65:33 - is it for this one you're trying to
65:34 - build that oh this tweet button on the
65:36 - sidebar
65:37 - yeah the two buttons okay yeah
65:40 - got it i'm gonna put that at the top
65:42 - every time you're building anything just
65:44 - like
65:45 - let me know functionality wise what
65:47 - we're building and then i can just have
65:49 - it at the top so everybody could see it
65:51 - yeah i think right now it's mainly just
65:54 - building out the sidebar yeah that's
65:55 - what we're doing
65:56 - i am focused on that yep yeah nice
65:59 - so let's uh continue on so we've got the
66:02 - fun weight of 900
66:04 - and then what we're going to do is the
66:05 - text you saw guys by default it
66:08 - basically
66:09 - uh capitalized everything so to get rid
66:11 - of that you say inherit
66:13 - sex transform inherit and what that does
66:15 - is it basically inherits the value from
66:16 - its parent which is basically normal
66:19 - as opposed to what whatever material ui
66:21 - does uh so it gets rid of that that auto
66:23 - capitalization
66:24 - and then we're going to love what's
66:25 - right garden tips he says i like the
66:27 - community and interaction
66:29 - i don't understand react and i don't
66:30 - want to learn it but your still your
66:32 - interaction is just awesome
66:34 - and then savaram says same i also just
66:36 - watch for the interaction they're
66:37 - awesome savaram is actually a flutter
66:39 - developer
66:40 - oh nice awesome i actually want to get
66:42 - involved with yeah
66:43 - yeah and i told him to message me on
66:45 - instagram and he has and i said hey make
66:47 - savara make actual videos and send them
66:50 - to me
66:50 - of you speaking and everything just like
66:52 - how we do it of you building flutter
66:54 - apps because we can have you teaching
66:56 - flutter on this
66:56 - platform yeah that'd be so dope
67:00 - obviously that would be really fun
67:01 - awesome so now we're going to add
67:03 - border radius height and a margin top so
67:05 - it's not so close to the last value
67:08 - and i do save and guys a few people
67:11 - asking what
67:11 - important is and it's basically going to
67:13 - override material ui's
67:15 - uh default styles that's why we need to
67:17 - have that if we don't have that it
67:18 - doesn't
67:19 - material ui takes precedent and it looks
67:21 - the way that material ui wants it to
67:23 - look
67:23 - hey we just broke over 10 000 views
67:25 - we're actually
67:26 - at 12 000 views right now total for this
67:30 - stream
67:30 - so thank you guys really appreciate you
67:34 - and uh yeah let's keep on going
67:39 - thank you so much guys amazing stuff
67:41 - right so now
67:42 - what we're going to do also cause if you
67:43 - go ahead and click the tweet button
67:45 - notice how there's like a really nice
67:47 - ripple effect right so that's another
67:49 - big benefit hold on
67:50 - they can't see it so i have to hide us
67:53 - boom
67:53 - oh that looks clean look at that yeah
67:56 - you get this like
67:57 - that's by default with material ui which
67:59 - if you was coding that naturally i don't
68:01 - even know where you'd begin with coding
68:02 - that like
68:03 - so just using the library gives you some
68:05 - packs like that right which is awesome
68:08 - um nice so now what we're gonna do
68:12 - um is basically go ahead
68:15 - and create i think we're actually done
68:18 - at this point with the sidebar so
68:19 - awesome yeah we're actually done with
68:21 - the sidebar
68:22 - yep nice yeah so we're done with the
68:24 - sidebar so the next step is actually
68:26 - hold on right down to the sidebar let's
68:27 - go
68:29 - hey gotta hit him with that and now
68:32 - next up is what so this is good whenever
68:35 - we get done
68:36 - just yeah let us know we're done with
68:38 - that and then let's have a hard
68:40 - transition
68:40 - add in some poo poo poo and then let's
68:43 - get clear on what we're gonna be
68:44 - building next
68:45 - visually and then we'll start coating it
68:47 - up so what are we now gonna work on
68:49 - we're working on the feed and yeah we're
68:52 - going to actually
68:53 - so i'm going to create both of these
68:54 - components and then i'm going to
68:56 - basically
68:56 - uh handle the way that they're spaced
68:58 - inside of the screen
69:00 - and then we're going to focus on so the
69:02 - main thing right now is actually
69:03 - feed let's just focus on the feed yeah
69:05 - got it okay
69:07 - yeah so we're gonna add the feed in guys
69:09 - now so the feed is that nice little
69:12 - place where all the posts on twitter
69:14 - live
69:16 - yep beautiful awesome amana says i feel
69:19 - you i could hit the thumbs up
69:21 - a million times and he goes i'm actually
69:23 - going to do that buzzfeed
69:24 - red says amazing managing team nice
69:26 - community interaction
69:28 - yep we're going to make sure we are
69:29 - trying to interact with almost every
69:31 - single
69:31 - person and i am looking at all the
69:34 - comments so if you guys see my eyes
69:36 - looking this way i'm looking at your
69:37 - comments reading them sometimes i'll
69:39 - even respond to a lot of them
69:40 - and then bring them up albert duke but
69:43 - says
69:44 - sonny i really love your coding style
69:45 - it's still i'm really learning a lot
69:47 - thank you dude
69:48 - really glad that i can provide some
69:50 - value with that and uh yeah
69:51 - keep watching nice awesome let's carry
69:55 - on guys
69:55 - so we're gonna go ahead and create the
69:57 - feed component so eventually the goal is
69:59 - to basically just have it like this
70:01 - where we have feed
70:02 - and it renders out that middle section
70:04 - so i'm going to go ahead and create that
70:06 - file otherwise it's going to scream at
70:07 - me for not working so we're going to say
70:09 - feed.js
70:10 - and we should pop into that file now so
70:13 - feed.js awesome
70:14 - and i'm going to do rfce and it
70:17 - should yes we have our snippets nice
70:21 - and basically with the feed what i'm
70:23 - going to do is i'm going to actually go
70:24 - ahead and have
70:27 - so the first thing i'm going to do is
70:29 - i'm just going to kind of draft this out
70:30 - again guys so
70:31 - at the top of the feed we kind of have
70:33 - this uh
70:35 - we have a header right we have a header
70:36 - at the top of the feed and then we have
70:39 - a tweet box so that's basically where
70:41 - you can tweet something
70:43 - and then we have a bunch of posts right
70:46 - so we have like a post
70:47 - and then basically we have x and like
70:50 - however many posts are rendered out
70:52 - right
70:53 - so that's our layout for the feed so at
70:55 - the top of the feed just so that we can
70:56 - see
70:57 - everything's working now let's go ahead
70:59 - and add h2 and we're just going to say
71:01 - this is the home right it's the home
71:03 - page so i'm going to go here and i'm
71:05 - going to go ahead and
71:06 - import this so i'm going to say import
71:08 - [Music]
71:09 - import sidebar so i'm going to change it
71:13 - to
71:13 - import sorry not home feed there we go
71:17 - and then i'm going to go ahead and save
71:19 - this file so it should pop in
71:21 - there we go and now you can see at the
71:22 - bottom it says home right and this the
71:24 - reason why it's coming under there
71:26 - is because by default this container so
71:29 - what i mean by this container is this
71:30 - app container so i'm going to go ahead
71:32 - and get rid of the hello clever
71:33 - programmers
71:34 - message by default this i can get rid of
71:37 - that comment as well
71:38 - by default guys the app container does
71:40 - something called display inline which
71:42 - basically stacks things on top of each
71:44 - other which is why
71:45 - the feed is appearing underneath it
71:47 - right
71:48 - but if we go ahead and go to app.css
71:51 - and i go ahead and change this so i go
71:54 - to the app and i basically go ahead and
71:56 - do display
71:57 - flex what this is going to do now is
72:00 - it's basically going to change the rules
72:02 - so that sidebar feed and anything else
72:05 - goes into a row right so
72:08 - because over here sidebar is on the left
72:11 - and then
72:11 - feed is in the middle whereas our feed
72:14 - was at the bottom
72:16 - now i'm actually starting to see it in
72:18 - being in a
72:19 - row yeah so now it's in a row right so
72:22 - we've got the sidebar and then the
72:24 - feed is actually now to the right of the
72:26 - sidebar
72:27 - yes now both components are in a row
72:29 - right oh interesting this is a row it
72:31 - doesn't look like a row
72:33 - yeah it doesn't actually look like a row
72:35 - but we've actually got two children
72:36 - there that are in a row
72:38 - yeah right as opposed to in a column
72:41 - so with that said now what we're going
72:44 - to do is we're actually going to go
72:46 - ahead
72:47 - and add the following so right now
72:49 - because we did that we made it display
72:51 - flex
72:51 - uh i want to go ahead and also i forgot
72:53 - to do one thing on that sidebar
72:56 - um what i want to actually do is or we
72:57 - could do it on the feed itself actually
72:59 - we could say
73:01 - um what should i do hey we just got a
73:03 - donation let's go
73:04 - be shake with the uh one dollar or more
73:08 - donation thank you so much really
73:10 - appreciate it thank you
73:11 - so much dude appreciate that awesome so
73:14 - with
73:14 - sidebar yeah okay so for the sidebar i
73:17 - forgot to add one thing so let's go
73:19 - ahead and add a border
73:21 - um so if we go to sidebar
73:24 - i'm actually going to go ahead and say
73:26 - so right now you guys can see
73:28 - we made the container the app flex right
73:31 - which made it in a row
73:32 - but i want to basically do a few rules
73:34 - here so firstly i would just want to
73:35 - give the sidebar
73:36 - a um a border right so i'm going to go
73:39 - ahead and do the following so i'm going
73:40 - to say border right
73:41 - one pixel solid twitter background color
73:45 - so we're using this as our background
73:46 - color which is like a gray all right as
73:48 - soon as i do that you'll see that like
73:49 - you wanna
73:50 - you wanna do something with this twitter
73:52 - icon at the top
73:53 - yeah we'll start with that as well yeah
73:55 - okay
73:57 - yeah so we've got the uh the yeah yeah
73:59 - we didn't start that one awesome
74:01 - nice catch so we're gonna drop down in
74:03 - the comments below actually
74:05 - oh awesome thank you guys we got kenai
74:08 - all right so now we've got
74:09 - the um we're gonna go ahead we added a
74:12 - border right
74:13 - but basically firstly you also want to
74:15 - make it so that because
74:16 - the app container we said to it
74:19 - become like a flex container right so we
74:22 - also want to say
74:23 - we want the sidebar to always use up 30
74:26 - of the screen so because that's like a
74:28 - nice
74:28 - equal share of the screen and that's how
74:30 - twitter kind of do it
74:31 - so if i go ahead and add flex 0.3 that
74:34 - says
74:35 - use up 30 in the screen right at this
74:38 - point in time it's already using up
74:39 - pretty much 30 so we didn't see much
74:41 - difference we also don't want it to
74:42 - shrink to a point where you can't see
74:44 - anything
74:44 - so i'm going to go ahead and add a min
74:47 - width of 250 pixels right which means
74:50 - that
74:50 - like don't shrink any more than 250
74:52 - pixels right but we can we can go ahead
74:54 - and comment this out for now because we
74:56 - just wanted to sort of
74:57 - be as responsive as possible for now but
74:59 - that's how you do that and stop it from
75:00 - shrinking anymore
75:02 - and then i want to say i don't want it
75:04 - to touch the top of the screen so i want
75:05 - to do min a margin top of 20 pixels
75:08 - um marginal opportunity pixels i'm going
75:10 - to say give it a little bit of padding
75:11 - on the left and right of 20 pixels right
75:13 - so padding
75:14 - on the left let's give it 20 pixels and
75:17 - padding on the right 20 pixels so it
75:19 - just looks a bit more cleaner so padding
75:21 - left padding
75:22 - right there we go and now if i save this
75:26 - we actually go ahead and we have a
75:27 - perfect looking sort of sidebar right
75:29 - and i'm going to go ahead and style that
75:31 - tweet so we saw the twitter icon
75:34 - in over here so if we go to sidebar
75:37 - let's go ahead and open the sidebar to
75:39 - our icon so in order to style this guys
75:41 - i need to give it a class name
75:43 - of sidebar twitter icon so i need to go
75:45 - ahead and give it a class name here
75:48 - so sidebar twitter icon like this and
75:51 - for this what i need to do is i need to
75:52 - go ahead and do
75:53 - the following so i need to target so
75:56 - sidebar twitter icon
75:58 - and basically i'm going to give it the
75:59 - color so the color of this i want to be
76:00 - blue
76:01 - so i want to be the color of twitter so
76:03 - we use our nice little variable here
76:05 - which is always kind of handy to chuck
76:07 - in also we
76:08 - remember any um icon is actually a font
76:11 - right so if you guys didn't know it's
76:13 - actually a font in the icon
76:15 - so 30 pixels if we do dash important
76:17 - it's because um
76:18 - exclamation marking point is because
76:19 - we're going to override material ui
76:21 - steam
76:22 - if i save that we'll see that it goes
76:24 - blue and it also becomes bigger
76:26 - now to push it in line with the rest of
76:28 - them i'm going to add a margin left and
76:30 - a slight bit of margin underneath
76:31 - it and if we save that now it'll go
76:34 - perfectly in line
76:35 - and we can see that there we go there we
76:37 - have the finished
76:39 - product when it comes to the sidebar
76:41 - right
76:42 - so that's really nice to see for app.css
76:45 - jumping back
76:46 - now what we're going to do is we're
76:48 - going to make the view height 100
76:50 - view height so if we go to height 100 vh
76:54 - you'll see that border actually will now
76:56 - touch the bottom
76:57 - so before i didn't have that it wasn't
77:00 - actually touching the bottom so if i go
77:01 - ahead and
77:02 - undo that you see that where that that
77:03 - border on the sidebar it didn't actually
77:05 - touch the bottom
77:06 - so i need to go ahead and add a height
77:07 - of 100 view height so a height
77:09 - of 100 view height
77:12 - and that will actually stretch that
77:14 - border to the bottom because
77:16 - it now lets the component use up the
77:17 - entire height of the screen
77:19 - okay and also you'll notice that if you
77:23 - go onto twitter so because you go into
77:24 - twitter make it full screen
77:30 - right so make it notice how there's
77:32 - actually a max
77:33 - width here right it's very you might not
77:36 - be able to tell
77:36 - but the screen is like it's there's got
77:38 - a max width so it's not
77:40 - stretching anymore so you see like you
77:42 - add some padding
77:43 - to the left to add some padding to the
77:45 - right oh it's actually adding margin
77:47 - whoa we got a thousand wow
77:50 - that is huge simba holy crap i really
77:54 - appreciate it
77:54 - he gave us a that's like 12 donation or
77:57 - 14
77:58 - donation and he said i have so many
78:00 - udemy courses which are unfinished most
78:02 - mostly because the instructor gets
78:03 - boring eventually but you guys
78:06 - teach more interactively keep us
78:07 - entertained with jokes and love sonny's
78:10 - tricks i
78:12 - love that guys that just reminded me i
78:14 - got to bring in my freaking gifs
78:16 - hot nice
78:19 - thank you bro appreciate you thank you
78:21 - so much dude
78:23 - awesome right so and now what we're
78:26 - going to do
78:27 - is we are going to yes you see on the
78:30 - twitter app they have like a max width
78:32 - here right so they
78:33 - automatically add some margins as soon
78:35 - as it hits that max width
78:36 - we want the same behavior inside of our
78:38 - app so right now because
78:39 - if you go to localhost and you make our
78:42 - localhost full screen
78:44 - look what happens you see like we don't
78:45 - have any of that behavior right
78:47 - we don't have any of that behavior right
78:48 - now so what we need to do is we need to
78:50 - go to app.css
78:52 - and add a max width of 1300 pixels
78:56 - because that's what they use on twitter
78:57 - it's about 1300 pixels
78:59 - which means that once it gets to a
79:00 - certain size make it that 800 pixels and
79:02 - then how do we center it
79:04 - right because if you're making a max
79:05 - width it's going to be kind of shoved to
79:07 - the left
79:08 - so what we do is the trick to centering
79:10 - is you say margin left and margin right
79:12 - of auto
79:12 - so automatically sent to doing that
79:15 - we're also going to add
79:16 - a little bit of padding i think another
79:18 - thing that's amazing about teaching it
79:20 - being able to teach it to you guys live
79:22 - is we can get instant feedback
79:24 - so if there's something confusing we'll
79:25 - start seeing it in the chat and then
79:27 - instantly be able to handle it if
79:29 - there's something that doesn't make
79:30 - sense or need more explanation
79:32 - you can't do that if you're just
79:33 - recording a video
79:35 - we won't be able to get that feedback
79:36 - from you guys so that's why it's helpful
79:38 - when you guys
79:38 - drop in all those things on the side
79:40 - just like some person said hey your
79:42 - twitter icon is unfinished boom we just
79:44 - finished it up right away and explained
79:46 - it right away
79:48 - exactly and also really good comment uh
79:50 - from
79:51 - the grace there you go sonny if my flex
79:52 - goes over a combined 100
79:55 - what happens and how can i check easily
79:57 - spent a lot of time on this today
79:58 - so it's actually a lot of practice is
80:00 - going to help you sort of get over that
80:01 - issue
80:02 - uh the more you kind of think about
80:04 - everything in sort of containers
80:06 - and abiding by flex rules you'll get
80:08 - better at understanding how things are
80:10 - positioned
80:10 - but remember what he's talking about
80:12 - here guys is for example we just set a
80:14 - rule here for the sidebar
80:15 - so if we go into sidebar we said the
80:17 - sidebar should take up 0.3
80:19 - and then eventually for the feed we're
80:22 - going to say it should take up 0.4
80:24 - which adds up to 70 0.7 and then we
80:27 - basically have
80:28 - 30 left to allocate to the widget that's
80:31 - what he's saying
80:32 - and that has to add up to 100 otherwise
80:35 - the responsiveness doesn't add up right
80:36 - so you need to make sure that you do
80:38 - that
80:38 - yeah you basically gotta get good at
80:40 - flexing
80:41 - so that's important i saw you lining it
80:45 - up
80:48 - i could see how it's like he's about to
80:50 - say something
80:53 - nice i like that understanding we're
80:55 - under our understanding is getting
80:57 - jacked nice so for the sidebar i'm going
81:01 - to basically go ahead and uncomment this
81:02 - out so it has to have a min width of 250
81:04 - pixels now
81:05 - um which allows us to sort of space it a
81:08 - little bit more actually in this case no
81:09 - that's fine
81:10 - um if we then go ahead and make it full
81:12 - screen kazi let's see that max width
81:14 - come into play now
81:16 - all right let's go nice
81:19 - i see that little uh you did you achieve
81:21 - this from padding or margin
81:23 - so you use margin left margin right of
81:25 - auto so margin left boom
81:29 - and then margin right this is going to
81:30 - give padding here like this much
81:33 - yeah because think about what he's
81:34 - trying to do margin left auto is saying
81:36 - all right add as much margin left as you
81:38 - possibly can
81:39 - where did you add this by the way you
81:40 - added this right here right
81:43 - padding i know it in here in appdos css
81:46 - eyescatch
81:47 - okay cool yeah so then both sides are
81:50 - adding as much margins as they possibly
81:51 - can which basically naturally allows it
81:53 - to center
81:54 - oh wait let me actually see what you're
81:56 - talking about
81:58 - oh nice so you don't actually even have
82:00 - to define how much margin you just said
82:02 - hey
82:03 - auto it damn yep and that's like if you
82:06 - was to do uh if you was to comment out
82:07 - margin
82:08 - right you would then see it push over to
82:10 - the left yeah
82:15 - nice wow yeah yep
82:18 - that's dope okay very handy trick when
82:21 - it comes to sort of positioning items
82:23 - there's loads of tricks guys that you'll
82:24 - pick up like when it comes to
82:25 - positioning
82:26 - and flexbox so it really really um does
82:29 - um yeah really really does help you out
82:32 - with that so nice
82:33 - so with that said now we're going to
82:34 - carry on with the
82:36 - uh we're going to carry on with the
82:40 - we're working on feed yeah so we're
82:42 - going to work on the feed so here we
82:44 - have the feed
82:44 - and at the top we had this home right so
82:47 - it says home
82:48 - now this doesn't look anything like the
82:49 - one they have on twitter so
82:51 - if we go ahead and open up twitter we'll
82:53 - see the end goal that we're trying to
82:54 - achieve
82:55 - so because let's open up twitter yeah
82:58 - yep so at the top of the page we see a
83:00 - home right and that home
83:02 - is left aligned and it has this nice
83:04 - little square box around it right
83:07 - what square oh i see yeah
83:10 - and also notice when you scroll down
83:13 - notice how home
83:14 - sticks right so it's going to stick as
83:17 - well so that's going to be something we
83:19 - want to achieve here so
83:20 - okay and six right we didn't we haven't
83:22 - actually got that sparkling little thing
83:24 - on the right but
83:25 - we actually do achieve the exact same
83:27 - design i couldn't actually find an icon
83:29 - for that but i mean we could we could
83:30 - stick something in there if we want
83:31 - yeah somebody gave a good suggestion
83:33 - that said for the hashtag icon
83:35 - you can actually use um i like this and
83:38 - then just put the hashtag in there and
83:40 - wrap it up with icon
83:42 - tag oh yeah nice yeah i just wanted to
83:46 - provide a sort of a reusable component
83:48 - way so that way most people would get
83:50 - otherwise you could definitely do that
83:51 - yeah and have it uh yeah nice awesome
83:55 - um right yes so steve mccarthy says
83:58 - sunny margin
83:59 - zero auto does the same thing yes it
84:01 - does but you're also then
84:02 - setting a default margin of zero to the
84:05 - top and bottom if you don't want to do
84:06 - that
84:07 - you don't you avoid that otherwise
84:08 - you're making sure that it's zero on top
84:10 - and one
84:10 - got it okay awesome so and now what
84:13 - we're going to do
84:14 - is the feed so the feed we have so what
84:17 - i'm going to do
84:17 - for that header what i'm actually going
84:19 - to go ahead and say is give it a little
84:20 - div so surround it inside of a div
84:22 - and give that div a class name a feed
84:24 - header so feed
84:26 - header and basically go ahead and chuck
84:28 - this
84:30 - inside of that right so now we have a
84:32 - div
84:33 - with this home right so i'm going to
84:35 - open up the feed
84:36 - dot css so oh we don't actually have
84:38 - v.css i need to import so import
84:42 - feed.css i need to create that file
84:44 - otherwise react's gonna cry
84:46 - and scream so here we do field dot css
84:52 - and we should snap into it now there we
84:54 - go and what i'm gonna say here
84:56 - is i'm gonna say for for the feed so
84:59 - remember we talked about the flex adding
85:01 - up to
85:01 - uh 100 so here i'm going to say target
85:04 - the feed container and say flex
85:06 - of 0.4 0.4 right so we're only using up
85:09 - 70 now but
85:11 - it's still going to basically try and
85:12 - balance out so we're going to say flex
85:13 - of 0.4
85:15 - and then we want to add a border right
85:18 - here so we're going to add a border
85:19 - right
85:20 - of twitter background one pixel solid
85:23 - which is basically going to add a sort
85:24 - of gray background we can't actually see
85:26 - that at the moment
85:26 - but if i was to exaggerate this to
85:28 - basically show you guys what i'm added
85:30 - there
85:30 - then go ahead and do the following and
85:32 - make it like this right
85:34 - then what you should be able to see is
85:35 - you see like like you get that red
85:38 - right that red sort of big block is
85:41 - getting added right
85:42 - yeah so instead of that what i'm trying
85:43 - to do now is basically just make it a
85:45 - twitter background
85:46 - uh of one pixel so that's why i'm added
85:48 - there and then what i'm going to say
85:49 - is the min width should be a fitting
85:52 - content and overflow
85:54 - y of squirrel and this this is important
85:56 - here guys so the min width
85:57 - is basically going to say whatever
86:01 - it should it must fit the content so
86:03 - whatever size the post is or anything
86:05 - that is inside of that container
86:07 - it has to fit that as a minimum width
86:09 - and then we're saying if you ever scroll
86:10 - like flows over so to get that scrolling
86:12 - function and it would say overflow y
86:14 - right so that's very important and we'll
86:16 - go over that in a sec
86:17 - um what that what that sort of does so
86:19 - now what i'm going to do is i'm actually
86:21 - going to go ahead
86:22 - and say for the header so for that top
86:25 - section right
86:26 - i'm going to target it so i'm going to
86:27 - say header
86:30 - feed header and i'm going to say firstly
86:32 - position should be sticky
86:34 - and this gives us that sticky
86:35 - functionality where it sticks to the top
86:37 - and in order to do that you all you need
86:38 - to do is say top
86:39 - zero all right yeah i think again
86:44 - exactly and then you need to give a
86:46 - background
86:48 - background color the z index of 100
86:51 - and this is important so you can use any
86:54 - value you can use like two but i always
86:55 - do 100 so that you're just sure that
86:57 - it's on top
86:58 - z index is basically going to say no
86:59 - matter what show this on top
87:01 - right because it's got a high number and
87:03 - then i'm going to give it a border
87:05 - of one pixel solid and i'm going to use
87:08 - the background color so again you can
87:09 - see where the variables are coming into
87:10 - play guys
87:11 - like it's just very easy to declare a
87:13 - consistent styling or theme when you're
87:15 - using this
87:16 - and then i'm going to say give it a
87:18 - padding 15 pixels
87:20 - top and bottom 20 pixels left and right
87:22 - right
87:23 - yeah if i save that now we can actually
87:26 - go ahead and see
87:28 - um we can see that it looks it looks
87:31 - super small
87:32 - right now right you can't actually see
87:33 - what's going on there oh yeah and the
87:34 - reason why
87:35 - yeah the reason why that's happening is
87:37 - because we don't all right firstly i
87:38 - haven't saved it i don't think
87:40 - so if i go ahead and save it um
87:46 - okay so the reason why that's happening
87:48 - guys is because we haven't actually gone
87:49 - ahead and firstly i need to save feed.js
87:52 - that'd be helpful so let me save that
87:55 - yeah
87:56 - the reason why this is happening guys is
87:57 - because we've aligned
87:59 - not like 0.3 to the sidebar 0.4
88:03 - to the feed and it doesn't know what to
88:05 - do with the rest of it so it's kind of
88:06 - just like figuring out it's like should
88:08 - i use some space or should i not so it
88:09 - kind of breaks our spacing
88:11 - so to fix that i'm going to add the
88:12 - final uh component here
88:15 - we're not going to build this component
88:17 - yet but i'm going to say widgets
88:19 - yeah and i'm going to give this spacing
88:20 - so that way we know that it's just going
88:22 - to use up that space so
88:24 - i'm going to create widget widgets dot
88:26 - js
88:27 - yeah oops uh so we're going to create
88:30 - that file we'll snap into that now rfce
88:34 - boom and i'm just going to add like a h2
88:36 - saying this is widgets or something
88:38 - right so i'm just going to say widgets
88:40 - and just for now and then basically the
88:42 - bare minimum styling i'm going to do
88:44 - here is i'm going to create a css file
88:45 - so i'm going to say widgets dot css
88:48 - save that file japan jabras asks
88:52 - what does var twitter background mean
88:55 - that's
88:55 - a variable and css so that's what we
88:58 - talked about
88:58 - if you actually even rewind to the start
89:00 - of the video we talk about it
89:02 - but it's just a variable in css and you
89:04 - guys can actually use them now
89:07 - by the way guys just keep in mind if
89:09 - something important right like
89:10 - a lot of it is you're going to learn
89:12 - through pattern recognition so i know
89:13 - some of you guys are going hey this
89:14 - front-end stuff is really confusing with
89:16 - the flexbox and css
89:18 - you know i got this for you like if you
89:20 - guys are actually feeling a little bit
89:21 - like this
89:22 - which sometimes happens to me with front
89:24 - end that's completely okay
89:26 - just keep coming in keep practicing
89:28 - building up that pattern recognition
89:29 - and you are going to be just fine
89:33 - exactly love that uh nice
89:36 - so we just created the widgets component
89:39 - so i need to go ahead and import that
89:41 - so i'm going to go ahead and do import
89:43 - widgets oh god
89:44 - i'm going to import widgets
89:48 - from widgets there we go
89:52 - and that will go ahead and do that so
89:54 - we've got this now and if i save it
89:57 - what we're going to do is just as a bare
89:58 - minimal styling to fix that issue we
90:00 - were having before is i'm going to go
90:01 - ahead firstly give this a class name so
90:03 - we can target and we'll say class name
90:06 - equals widgets and i'm going to go to
90:09 - the css file for widgets so we'll just
90:10 - start css i'm going to target that
90:12 - and now it's going to use up the
90:14 - remainder so it's going to say 0.3
90:18 - right so now we should see
90:22 - so if i save that file so it should use
90:25 - up 0.3 so if we make
90:27 - the uh that bigger in our kazi so if we
90:29 - make the
90:30 - our screen a little bit bigger yep
90:34 - now we can we should be able to see so
90:35 - let's go ahead and figure out why that's
90:37 - happening so
90:38 - app we've said has display flex
90:42 - and yes so what app js is
90:45 - display flex and then the feed and the
90:47 - widgets feed.css is 0.4 and then our
90:50 - feed.css is 0.4
90:53 - yep and then in the widgets
90:56 - we've gone ahead and done flex of 0.3
91:01 - and i need to save this file for it to
91:03 - maybe take effect
91:07 - right nice so now in the feed oh right
91:10 - okay sorry
91:11 - that's why yeah so remember guys we
91:13 - added in the feed and then min width
91:15 - should be fit content
91:17 - if i go ahead and save this now and get
91:19 - rid of this
91:20 - it should actually go ahead and use up
91:22 - more of that room but the reason why
91:24 - is basically because it hasn't got
91:25 - content to sort of fill it out right so
91:27 - this is fine for now actually
91:28 - it just looks like it's incorrect but
91:30 - it's actually okay for now
91:32 - um so okay so moving on so we've got the
91:35 - feed we've got the home
91:36 - awesome so i'm going to go ahead and
91:39 - target the h2 and i'm going to say give
91:41 - it a bit more of a nicer text so font
91:43 - size
91:44 - should be 20 and font weight should be
91:46 - 80 800
91:48 - so as soon as i hit save on that we
91:50 - should see that
91:51 - save is that is that actually making a
91:53 - difference if i do background color
91:55 - let's go ahead and do background color
91:58 - of like red for example
92:00 - so background color of red uh-huh
92:04 - let's just see if that actually changes
92:06 - the text save it
92:09 - yep i did no
92:13 - i feel like there's some is there some
92:14 - weird caching going on
92:16 - yeah let me uh hard refresh so command
92:19 - shift r
92:19 - on your guys's mac is hard refresh just
92:22 - in case there's some caching
92:24 - no i don't i don't really see any
92:25 - caching going on here man
92:28 - so feed.css was saying okay
92:32 - okay guys this is where you have to be
92:34 - super cl uh
92:36 - careful right so i actually made a big
92:38 - mistake here so no wonder why i wasn't
92:40 - making
92:41 - any changes is because the div here had
92:44 - the class name of feed
92:46 - so this needs to be on the outside and
92:48 - this div
92:49 - is going to have the class name of feed
92:51 - header
92:53 - all right and if i click save yeah
92:55 - that's somebody actually said that in
92:56 - the chat
92:57 - earlier yeah so you see that now
93:00 - it all sort of makes sense and
93:02 - everything's good okay
93:03 - yep there you go nice nice
93:09 - awesome so that's exactly what happened
93:12 - there and that's why
93:13 - and you see there's like this nasty sort
93:15 - of scroll bar
93:16 - that's there right so if i go ahead and
93:18 - make this bigger
93:20 - so if i go ahead and do like abc and i
93:21 - just like spam this so we can actually
93:23 - get some kind of like scrolling
93:26 - going on so if i go ahead and save save
93:28 - save save
93:29 - so now you should see now spoilable
93:33 - but we see that nobody wants to see that
93:35 - scroll bar right it's really ugly nobody
93:37 - wants to see that
93:38 - so there's a little trick you can do and
93:41 - these are the lines of code that you
93:42 - need to add to get that trick working
93:44 - you go to feed dot css and basically you
93:47 - add this so you say
93:49 - feed colon colon webkit scroll bar
93:51 - display none
93:52 - and this will hide it for chrome safari
93:54 - and opera and then for this one
93:56 - we can actually go ahead and add this
93:58 - inside of this feed up here but
94:00 - we're just making it very clear for you
94:01 - guys so we're going to say
94:03 - hide it for in ie edge and firefox and
94:05 - you basically add these lines of code
94:06 - and basically what this one is as soon
94:08 - as i hit save now
94:09 - you keep the functionality of the scroll
94:11 - but you hide the scroll bar
94:13 - so now cause you can still scroll
94:16 - so if you scroll yep you can still
94:18 - scroll right but but it's just we don't
94:20 - have that ugly scroll bar which is kind
94:22 - of important right
94:24 - so that's very very important to get
94:26 - that sort of styling so let's go ahead
94:28 - and now we can see
94:29 - that and also the home stuck which is
94:31 - good so
94:32 - if i go ahead and save now we can see
94:37 - uh there we go so we've got a nice
94:39 - little point now we've got that little
94:40 - home at the top looking the way it needs
94:42 - to look so
94:42 - the next step guys is just go ahead and
94:44 - create a tweet box
94:46 - right so now what we're going to do is
94:48 - we're going to create a tweet box so we
94:50 - can maybe actually add that as the sort
94:51 - of current
94:52 - active activity
94:56 - uh kazi we can add that as the current
94:57 - activity so building the tweets
95:00 - yeah building tweets cool
95:03 - yes this one's gonna be building the
95:05 - tweet box so
95:08 - what we're gonna do now is here we're
95:10 - gonna have a tweet box
95:12 - and this is basically gonna be that box
95:13 - that you can basically tweet from
95:15 - right it's going to have like some
95:16 - message and stuff like that inside of it
95:18 - and then you basically has a tweet
95:20 - button so i'm going to go ahead and
95:20 - create this and it's going to freak out
95:22 - because we don't have a tweetbox
95:24 - component so i'm going to go ahead and
95:25 - create one
95:26 - tweetbox.js and we should snap into the
95:28 - file now
95:30 - and then it should say rfce
95:34 - boom we're inside a tweet box then as
95:37 - usual guys we need to import
95:39 - tweetbox.css
95:40 - so i'm going to go ahead and do the
95:41 - following import tweetbox.css
95:44 - i need to create that file so
95:48 - tweetbox.css
95:49 - so i'm going to create that file and
95:51 - then
95:52 - we actually should be all good to go so
95:54 - now what i'm going to do guys is
95:56 - remember we stick by them
95:58 - so we need to add the class name of a
96:00 - tweet box
96:01 - so tweet box there we go
96:06 - and then what we're going to have inside
96:08 - of here we're basically going to have
96:10 - the um so we're going to have a very
96:13 - sort of more a more simplified version
96:15 - as
96:15 - as compared to the one that you saw
96:16 - previously we're going to have
96:18 - a input field which has like what's
96:20 - happening and you can pretty much type a
96:22 - message
96:22 - under it's going to have like a link
96:24 - like a a chance for you to add an image
96:28 - tag and then you can basically post it
96:30 - and you can
96:31 - you can tweet that out to everyone so
96:33 - because we want to have the enter
96:34 - functionality so when you can type a
96:35 - message and hit enter
96:36 - i'm going to do form it's going to be
96:39 - surrounded inside of a form and i'm
96:40 - going to have a
96:41 - div so first i'm going to have a div
96:43 - which is called
96:44 - tweet box input so tweet box
96:48 - input like this and in here i'm going to
96:51 - have
96:52 - the following so i'm going to have tweet
96:53 - box input and then outside that div
96:55 - i'm going to have a button so button and
96:57 - this button is going to be very simple
96:59 - it's just going to have
97:00 - tweet right so i need to import this
97:04 - from material ui so i need to go up to
97:06 - the top and say import
97:08 - the avatar the button from material i
97:11 - and now the avatar what is the avatar
97:14 - so in this case we're just going to work
97:16 - hard coding a user here so we're going
97:17 - to say
97:18 - get an avatar and advertise basically
97:20 - that circle little image
97:21 - and here we're using one from kajabi uh
97:24 - which is basically which is basically
97:26 - uh kazi's uh the the sort of clever
97:29 - programmer logo right so
97:31 - you guys can go ahead and see this right
97:32 - here this actually
97:34 - by the way i think we're actually going
97:36 - through a possible change
97:39 - oh yeah yeah so we're actually going to
97:41 - be rebranding clever programmer and
97:43 - would love to actually get your guys
97:45 - insight on that too at some point and
97:47 - i'll share some stuff with you guys
97:48 - along the way in the upcoming videos
97:52 - yeah that'll be dumb because then uh
97:54 - yeah we're gonna be changing that logo
97:55 - but
97:56 - for now this is the one that you guys
97:57 - are kind of used to you see it all the
97:59 - time
98:00 - this logo right here guys if we go ahead
98:02 - and click save
98:03 - should i need to get rid of the spacing
98:05 - one sec boom
98:06 - boom you can add any image here guys so
98:09 - add one of your cells
98:10 - um which is just a demo example so
98:14 - we've got the input there and then what
98:16 - i'm going to go ahead and do
98:17 - is add an input underneath it so we've
98:19 - got the avatar and then an input
98:21 - which with the placeholder of saying
98:23 - what's happening right so as soon as i
98:24 - click
98:25 - save now it says tweetbox is not defined
98:28 - in feed
98:29 - because we haven't imported this so
98:32 - let's go ahead
98:32 - and import that so
98:35 - tweet box i need to import
98:39 - your box import tweet box from tweet box
98:43 - there we go save and now
98:47 - we should be able to see it comes in so
98:50 - now we've got a bunch of things we've
98:51 - got the clever programmer logo
98:53 - we've got what's happening and we've got
98:55 - a tweet but we need to make that
98:57 - look like the one it looks like on
98:58 - twitter right and we're also going to
99:01 - have something underneath that to make
99:02 - it even better so we're going to have
99:03 - the input field of saying what's
99:05 - happening
99:05 - and i also want to have some like
99:06 - another input field maybe underneath it
99:09 - or somewhere else which is basically
99:10 - just going to say like something like
99:12 - this so this isn't on twitter but we're
99:13 - going to use it as a demonstration
99:15 - and say enter image url right and this
99:17 - is going to be optional
99:18 - um and basically you can just put an
99:20 - image there and we're going to use that
99:22 - image to basically push on a tweet if
99:24 - you add that in
99:26 - so uh just comment down here just real
99:29 - quick i wanted to share this with you
99:30 - guys as well
99:31 - and let me know what you guys think
99:32 - about this new logo design that we're
99:34 - trying to come up with so
99:36 - that's it's this design right over here
99:39 - i'll try to pause it here a little bit
99:41 - but we're not 100 on it yet but we're
99:43 - working on it so if you guys think this
99:45 - is cool or we're heading in the right
99:46 - direction
99:47 - do let us know because i want you guys
99:48 - behind the process because whatever the
99:50 - next one is going to be is
99:51 - going to be pretty much permanent so uh
99:55 - yeah i'm super excited about it yeah
100:00 - nice um right so
100:03 - with that said oh thank you louise
100:05 - flores you just donated 20 dollars wow

100:30 - that is huge thank you guys so much
100:35 - yeah i didn't realize you were up that
100:36 - much no i didn't i didn't realize that
100:38 - either
100:39 - all added up so thank you guys so much
100:41 - hugely appreciate that
100:44 - yeah really really love that nice all
100:47 - right so
100:48 - we have the following right now but
100:50 - obviously it looks really ugly we want
100:52 - to make this look a lot better
100:53 - basically what he said louis floors what
100:54 - he said is uh he goes
100:57 - let me actually pop that up on the
100:58 - screen as well oh yeah
101:00 - and he said just finished uh boot camp
101:02 - and this is a great addition
101:04 - to my learning thank you boom beautiful
101:06 - awesome
101:08 - nice and guys if you are interested in a
101:11 - boot camp you've never been inside of a
101:13 - boot camp or
101:14 - like you want to get involved in
101:15 - something like that make sure you check
101:16 - out the link in the description
101:18 - and look at the course because it's
101:20 - pretty much more than a bootcamp could
101:21 - offer so
101:22 - go ahead and look at that if you're
101:24 - interested nice
101:26 - um so now what we're going to do is go
101:27 - ahead and style this so we added the
101:29 - tweetbox.css file so i'm going to go
101:31 - ahead and pop that over here
101:33 - and the tweetbox.css file and now if i
101:36 - go ahead and grab
101:39 - some code so basically let's go ahead
101:40 - and make this look pretty so the first
101:42 - thing we're going to do is
101:44 - target tweetbox and i'm gonna say add a
101:47 - padding
101:48 - bottom so you guys are gonna see this
101:49 - and i love doing it like this because
101:50 - you're gonna see it
101:51 - as we change it so 10 pixels bottom and
101:54 - then i'm going to add a border
101:55 - bottom because in in twitter they
101:57 - actually have a border underneath it
102:00 - which is really nice uh but basically
102:02 - i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm
102:03 - going to say border bottom
102:04 - and then padding right of 10 pixels so
102:06 - if i save this
102:07 - you can see we've got like a little bit
102:09 - of a padding there nice and then i'm
102:10 - going to say for that form
102:12 - i want to do display flex and flex
102:14 - direction column and now what this is
102:16 - going to do is going to put the avatar
102:18 - and the input field on the same uh
102:20 - vertical axis so now if i go ahead and
102:22 - do that
102:23 - it should actually go ahead and it will
102:24 - do display flex flex direction column so
102:26 - now
102:27 - we should see oh sorry
102:30 - it's not going to do that i've got it
102:32 - mixed up um
102:33 - the tweet box input if i apply display
102:36 - flex to that
102:37 - we will then have the avatar and the
102:40 - input field on the same line what we
102:43 - just did before
102:44 - was actually setting the tweet box which
102:46 - was if we look at tweet box
102:48 - we can see it put this child
102:51 - and this child so the form they actually
102:54 - put the form
102:56 - um it said this so this child here so
102:58 - this one right here and the button it
103:00 - put that into a flex
103:02 - column structure which is why tweet is
103:04 - taking up the entire
103:05 - width right now all right and then we
103:07 - basically got the avatar and the input
103:09 - for looking nice
103:10 - the next step is i want the input field
103:12 - to take up the full width that it can so
103:14 - i'm going to go ahead and do that so i'm
103:16 - going to say
103:16 - target the input field flex 1 so i want
103:19 - it to take up more room than the avatar
103:20 - give it a margin left so it's not
103:22 - touching the avatar font size of 20
103:24 - pixels
103:25 - and a border of none and as soon as i
103:27 - hit save on that
103:29 - boom look at that immediately like look
103:32 - at that change that it adds guys
103:33 - so like if i undo that so if i go ahead
103:36 - and comment that out
103:37 - this is what front end is all about so
103:39 - if i go ahead and comment out look how
103:41 - trashy that looks right that looks
103:43 - horrible doesn't look very nice as soon
103:45 - as i add this
103:46 - in it suddenly becomes real like as soon
103:48 - as i add that in
103:50 - boom like you suddenly get this nice
103:53 - crisp user experience right
103:56 - 55.
104:01 - awesome so now what we're going to do is
104:03 - we're going to target the button i'll
104:04 - never say fubar
104:09 - i you know if fooba used to confuse the
104:11 - crap out of me dude i used to be like
104:12 - what's going on oh
104:14 - frank frank [ __ ] it every time coming
104:19 - and swinging
104:20 - frank dude whatever i think that just
104:24 - pushed us over a hundred
104:26 - hey dude we just got 102
104:29 - total thank you frank coming in hot with
104:31 - this 25
104:32 - donation he goes these layouts keep
104:34 - getting better so many tutorials have an
104:36 - ugly front end this is exactly what a
104:39 - twitter clone should look like
104:40 - let's go dude my energy even if my
104:43 - energy is low and i haven't had my
104:45 - coffee frank comes in swinging and i'm
104:46 - [ __ ] at a tent
104:49 - this makes me happy dude he does dude he
104:52 - just comes in and crushes
104:56 - oh man i love that broke a hundred
104:58 - dollars
104:59 - thank you guys that is huge this is our
105:02 - fifth stream
105:03 - we're you guys helped us break a hundred
105:06 - dollars what the hell
105:07 - that is crazy massive appreciation guys
105:11 - thank you so much
105:14 - swinging okay
105:17 - right so guys the next step what we're
105:19 - going to do now is we're going to target
105:20 - that button inside the form so the tweet
105:22 - button
105:22 - right so instead of doing some
105:25 - complicated nesting i'm going to just go
105:26 - ahead and give this a class name
105:28 - of tweet box button so i say tweet
105:31 - box underscore tweet button so tweet
105:35 - button
105:37 - there you go oops straight button there
105:39 - we go nice
105:41 - and now what i'm gonna do is i'm going
105:43 - to basically go ahead and do this
105:44 - so tweet box tweet button and i need to
105:47 - go ahead and give the following so i
105:48 - want this to look like the twitter
105:49 - button so basically i'm going to apply
105:51 - all of the same styles that we did to
105:54 - the previous button inside of
105:56 - the sidebar so it's the exact same as
105:58 - before nothing different there guys so
106:00 - i'm gonna add the same things in
106:02 - but the only thing different is this
106:03 - margin left so margin left i'm adding
106:06 - now so imagine that the reason why i'm
106:07 - adding that is because
106:08 - we actually added a width of 80 pixels
106:12 - so we actually added a width of 80
106:14 - pixels here so
106:16 - and then what i'm gonna do is uh one
106:18 - second i'm just going to turn off my
106:20 - flux because
106:21 - oh no it's freezing my computer
106:25 - okay ignore it anyway so margin left
106:27 - right now if i undo this it basically
106:29 - pushes that tweet button to the right so
106:30 - it looks like twitter right we have it
106:32 - like that
106:32 - awesome so there we go and now i want to
106:35 - add in
106:36 - one more field which is the that enter
106:38 - image url so let's go ahead and save
106:41 - that now
106:42 - and we should see enter image url
106:45 - right there so that's kind of ugly i
106:48 - mean i might actually change
106:49 - the look and feel of that so we might
106:51 - have it underneath maybe
106:53 - let's go ahead and do it like that and
106:54 - then let's go and give it a class name
106:57 - so and let's just style that so it looks
106:59 - kind of clean
107:01 - let's go ahead and do input and let's go
107:03 - ahead and give this one
107:04 - uh input image let's call it let's just
107:07 - call it
107:08 - image input
107:11 - like this right and this one is
107:14 - basically going to be like for the demo
107:16 - purposes of when we start pushing this
107:17 - into the database
107:19 - it's going to be used for that
107:20 - predominantly so if i go ahead and do
107:21 - this
107:22 - and now i want to basically say for this
107:24 - one we don't want any border
107:26 - so get rid of the border so i bought a
107:28 - none save it we should see that and
107:30 - we're going to say padding uh let's just
107:31 - give it 20 pixels of padding
107:34 - 20 pixels of padding there we go and
107:37 - then
107:38 - we should see boom okay nice and let's
107:41 - go ahead and make this very subtle
107:42 - actually do this
107:43 - 10 pixels everybody know that
107:46 - um this is here is the github repo for
107:50 - this if you guys want to actually get
107:52 - access to it
107:53 - the code i just dropped it in the
107:55 - comments below
107:56 - and i just put it in the description of
107:59 - the youtube video so it should be there
108:01 - if you guys go and check it out
108:02 - but this will have access to all the
108:04 - code you guys can actually click source
108:06 - and then you'll be able to see
108:07 - everything that sunny is building out
108:09 - right now so for example when we were
108:10 - building sidebar option
108:13 - boom all the code is here when we're
108:15 - building out the
108:16 - css all the code is right here you see
108:19 - we're using var twitter color
108:21 - so either way however you want to follow
108:23 - along whatever is the easiest for you
108:25 - you can go here
108:26 - and then if you want access to this and
108:27 - you guys like this make sure to click
108:29 - that star button
108:30 - and fork it and then that'll allow you
108:32 - to actually code into it and make
108:34 - changes to it and make it essentially
108:35 - your own
108:37 - exactly yeah definitely go ahead and do
108:40 - that guys because
108:41 - i know a lot of you guys might actually
108:42 - want to take this at your own pace so a
108:44 - really good way of doing that is by
108:46 - following us on
108:47 - um oh vinayak nirvani just donated five
108:52 - pounds
108:52 - thank you dude don't stop making these

109:27 - got a tweet button which is really nice
109:29 - right so we're going to do the
109:30 - functionality of things afterwards
109:32 - so we're actually going to leave the
109:34 - tweet box there so we've done that
109:36 - and then the next step is let's go ahead
109:38 - and create a post right so let's go
109:39 - ahead and create a post
109:41 - um a post is going to be something which
109:44 - is going to be a lot more sort of
109:45 - customizable because we actually want to
109:46 - repeat it
109:47 - have a lot more things up on the screen
109:49 - so for now what i'm going to go ahead
109:50 - and do is

111:57 - do is inside of here
112:00 - so post let's talk about post for a
112:02 - second right so the first thing we need
112:03 - to do is kind of import
112:05 - a css file because we're going to have
112:06 - to style it so let's do post.css
112:08 - get that out of the way and create the
112:10 - files for post.css
112:12 - there we go so now we go hold on hold on
112:16 - before you continue hold on hold on
112:17 - i still i want to know 100 what do you
112:20 - mean by that so what does that mean like
112:22 - when i
112:22 - click tweet it will post it
112:26 - yeah no so right now we're creating the
112:28 - post component
112:29 - first and then we'll be doing so what
112:31 - does that mean when you say post
112:33 - component that means this button right
112:34 - here
112:36 - no so if you go ahead and open twitter
112:39 - uh okay let me go ahead and open twitter
112:42 - boom
112:43 - hey jennifer shahady she's so awesome
112:45 - but go ahead what's up
112:47 - nice so you notice how all of these
112:49 - posts right so you see like this is a
112:51 - post you've got
112:52 - oh i got it this is the
112:55 - component we're building yeah we're
112:58 - going okay that component
113:00 - all right i'm just going to write that
113:01 - down right here post
113:03 - uh component so okay
113:06 - cool yeah so that changes what i say at
113:09 - the top as well
113:10 - so it's got it's not the ad about to
113:11 - make a twitter post it's actually the
113:13 - post component
113:15 - damn the greatest ever donated again he
113:18 - said wanted to make my donation
113:20 - this popped down the screen dude let me
113:22 - pop in on the screen just a second boom
113:24 - five four three two one
113:26 - here we go go for it sonny nice
113:29 - he says wanted to make my donation worth
113:31 - ten dollars as well
113:33 - and that's all i currently have i'm
113:34 - doing some things to make sure i can
113:35 - join
113:36 - pwa next week can't wait dude honestly
113:39 - the fact you donated anything oh yes we
113:42 - appreciate that
113:43 - so much seriously thank you so much
113:45 - being here yeah
113:46 - thank you so much seriously that's
113:48 - awesome yeah he donated multiple times
113:50 - that's so great
113:51 - but guys this is this is actually what
113:53 - we're building um
113:55 - and yeah suddenly every single time i
113:57 - want to keep i'll keep either asking you
113:59 - but i think that level of clarity is
114:00 - really important
114:01 - um yeah and we'll just visualize exactly
114:04 - what we're building and then we'll move
114:05 - forward
114:07 - agreed yeah definitely cool nice so now
114:10 - we're gonna do is go on with the bem
114:11 - convention so i'm gonna add
114:13 - the post class right here awesome and
114:16 - then what we're gonna do
114:17 - is uh so let's think about a post right
114:19 - a post has a bunch of different props
114:22 - they can receive so it has a display
114:24 - name
114:24 - so in this case let's look at the one on
114:26 - the right we've got paco sanchez
114:28 - which is the display name so display
114:30 - name right there
114:31 - we've got the username so the username
114:33 - is paco
114:34 - luis l so the username is something
114:37 - different to the display name
114:38 - we've got a verified right verified
114:41 - because some users are verified
114:43 - you get a nice little verified badge if
114:45 - you're verified
114:46 - and then we've also got things like a
114:48 - timestamp so in this case the timestamp
114:50 - is three hours it goes like
114:52 - here jennifer shahadi is verified
114:55 - so if you look at this little tick mark
114:57 - right here i mean i think everybody
114:58 - knows what that is but just
115:00 - to visualize but yeah exactly
115:04 - cool yeah we'll leave the time some now
115:06 - we'll do that one afterwards let's do
115:08 - the text oh actually let me actually let
115:10 - me do it like this sonny let's do it
115:11 - like this
115:12 - so i'm gonna draw a square around this
115:15 - and let's just
115:15 - put every single thing that's going to
115:17 - be a thing here so then we can know
115:19 - so okay so walk me through it we got
115:22 - what do we got we've got the display
115:24 - name
115:24 - so the ones that we're going to be doing
115:26 - for the post is display name
115:28 - we've got the username got it
115:32 - right we've got if the user is verified
115:35 - or not so if they have that little like
115:36 - for example jennifer shahady at the
115:38 - bottom
115:39 - has a little blue tick right we're gonna
115:40 - have a little blue badge icon if they're
115:42 - verified
115:43 - so let me display name boom and then
115:46 - username is this one right here exactly
115:49 - cool verified verified yeah
115:53 - and then we've got the text so the text
115:56 - is the message just posted with
115:58 - alongside the post yeah right
116:01 - we've also got an image now this can be
116:04 - a normal image or it can be a gif
116:06 - or a gif depending on how everyone says
116:07 - it
116:09 - i said jeff
116:13 - yeah and then we've got the
116:16 - avatar so the avatar is for example it
116:18 - could be like cars
116:20 - like the clever program logo or like
116:22 - anyone's
116:23 - their avatar so their their profile
116:24 - picture right
116:26 - that's gonna be the so here we have a
116:29 - few different things
116:31 - and what we're going to do is we're
116:32 - going to pass those in as props
116:34 - and is that it that's it yeah that's
116:37 - what we're going to be doing
116:38 - okay cool so awesome guys this is what
116:40 - we're going gonna be building
116:42 - and now if i contrast this with what
116:44 - sunny had
116:45 - on this side over here you guys will now
116:48 - see all of those things
116:49 - sunny is writing them here so you got
116:51 - the display name username verified badge
116:54 - text image avatar all that good stuff
116:57 - exactly for the likes the comments and
117:00 - those things we're just going to do
117:01 - the the sort of user interface behind it
117:04 - yeah
117:04 - but you can definitely go ahead and guys
117:06 - i recommend like when you actually go
117:08 - ahead and follow this tutorial out
117:10 - go ahead and take it a step further and
117:11 - implement those things implement the
117:13 - numbers implement the likes
117:14 - that way you differentiate yourself from
117:16 - just everyone else who's building the
117:18 - clone
117:18 - styling is amazing didn't know
117:22 - these streams and i cannot get enough of
117:24 - it beautiful
117:25 - i agree nice honestly that's how i used
117:28 - to like have this issue i i
117:31 - hated ben when i first heard of it and
117:33 - then i was like why do we need this and
117:34 - then
117:34 - now i live by it so i love this watch
117:38 - ashish says we want crazy frank and
117:41 - crazy quasi talking on the channel
117:43 - it would be so fun to watch their
117:45 - energies together frank
117:46 - swinging in always makes me happy by the
117:50 - reaction cozy and sunny give
117:53 - i love that yo sarin coming and swinging
117:56 - let's go
117:58 - sarin coming in hi uh with eight dollar
118:01 - donation he says i have finished my boot
118:03 - camp recently thanks for sharing your
118:04 - knowledge you guys are helping me polish
118:06 - my skills and learning new stuff at the
118:08 - same time
118:09 - oh man that makes me happy that's
118:10 - amazing
118:13 - appreciate that dude thank you
118:16 - this is insane i love the support they
118:18 - give
118:19 - all right people keep saying time stamp
118:21 - people keep crying like
118:22 - time are we going to put anything with
118:24 - the timestamp where it says 13h
118:26 - yeah so we could do timestamp the reason
118:28 - why i've left timestamp out now is
118:30 - because i want to focus more on getting
118:31 - everything else but with timestamps
118:33 - we can kind of go into it we can kind of
118:35 - you there's ways of manipulating time
118:37 - using moment.js and all that stuff
118:39 - but guys for now i just want to focus on
118:41 - a lot more of the value in the in this
118:43 - case it's going to be posting to
118:44 - a backend doing all that stuff and not
118:46 - messing too much around with timestamps
118:49 - we did do timestamp stuff in previous
118:51 - builds guys
118:52 - thank you this is the first time this
118:54 - has happened we have officially it hit
118:56 - over 150
118:58 - or actually exactly 150 in chat revenue
119:01 - so thank you guys so much that's
119:03 - huge that's insane dude
119:06 - oh my god i remember do you remember
119:08 - because the first time we got a donation
119:10 - we were like yo i think we're going to
119:11 - hit
119:11 - five dollars yeah i mean i i will be i
119:14 - had never even hit over three dollars
119:16 - and since the four years of this channel
119:19 - so like when we got like three dollars
119:21 - four dollars almost fell off my chair
119:23 - and i feel like i'll keep falling off my
119:25 - chair because i
119:26 - every single time it's massive to me
119:29 - just a massive vote of confidence from
119:31 - people so it's huge
119:33 - definitely huge yeah awesome
119:36 - so let's carry on strong guys so we have
119:39 - the post
119:39 - right and what we're gonna do now is
119:41 - we're gonna actually gonna sort of
119:43 - separate everything into containers so
119:45 - like stick with me during this section
119:46 - because we have a few different
119:47 - containers that we're going to put in
119:49 - place
119:50 - and they all have a purpose michael is
119:52 - like bring in moment.js
119:54 - i know we'll think about it we'll think
119:57 - about it
119:58 - i think about it if we get if we get
119:59 - enough time then we can do it right
120:01 - yeah see us at office hours after the
120:03 - stream
120:04 - yeah nice so
120:07 - what we're going to do now is we
120:09 - actually are going to firstly create a
120:11 - div for the appetite this is where bem
120:12 - comes in big guys right
120:14 - so i'm going to make a div and i'm going
120:15 - to say post and this one is going to be
120:17 - a container around the avatar
120:19 - right and there's a reasons why we're
120:21 - going to do all this stuff and it'll
120:22 - make sense at the end so
120:23 - we're going to have an avatar here so an
120:25 - avatar so that's a little circle icon
120:28 - and i'm gonna use the one for clever
120:30 - programmer so this is the same link we
120:31 - used earlier so if you want to get that
120:33 - you can go ahead and use the link we
120:34 - used earlier
120:35 - so boom if you guys are wondering how to
120:38 - get this it's all in the github that we
120:39 - pushed so you guys have access to that
120:41 - imran says imran says i'm building all
120:44 - the clones which you guys are launching
120:45 - every day
120:46 - one day i will become a clone of sunny
120:48 - and quasi
120:50 - hey i love that i didn't see that coming
120:53 - yeah
120:55 - turn up sunny and cozy holy crap yeah
120:58 - all right all right so amanda
121:01 - is like let's hit 200.
121:06 - so we have we hit the save button on
121:09 - that so now we've got the avatar we
121:10 - should pop in right now we're obviously
121:12 - not going to see anything
121:13 - so what i'm going to actually go and do
121:14 - so we can see this visually let's open
121:16 - up and let's go ahead and pop a post in
121:18 - here right now and then let's go and
121:19 - import it
121:20 - so do this um and then that way we can
121:23 - actually visually see something which is
121:25 - always nice
121:26 - so save right
121:30 - so with that said now we should see that
121:31 - little avatar nice
121:33 - okay so the next step guys is we're
121:35 - going to create the body and the reason
121:36 - why we're doing this is because we want
121:38 - the avatar on the left and then
121:39 - everything on the right so
121:41 - we're in that little gap so i'm going to
121:42 - do here div dot post
121:45 - body so post body like this
121:48 - and basically here what we have is
121:51 - different sections to the body right
121:53 - so i'm going to have different sections
121:55 - inside the body so
121:57 - the first section i'm going to have is a
121:58 - header right and inside of the header
122:00 - we're going to have the sort of like the
122:01 - text to sort of uh
122:03 - if it said like kazi said this or
122:05 - something like that right so here i'm
122:06 - going to have div
122:07 - dot post header
122:11 - right and inside of the header i'm going
122:13 - to have first these i'm going to have
122:14 - some header text right so i'm going to
122:16 - say dev dot header text dev dot header
122:18 - oops
122:19 - post sorry post header
122:22 - text right and then inside of here i'm
122:26 - going to have a h3
122:28 - and just for now we will be swapping out
122:30 - with the variables but i just want to do
122:31 - it so that you guys can see it so i'm
122:32 - going to say rafaeli
122:34 - said like oh in this case because and
122:37 - i'm going to span
122:38 - reason i'm spanning now is because i
122:40 - want to apply some styles in a sec
122:42 - to just this bit of text right so i'm
122:44 - going to say spam
122:45 - and then i'm going to have a verified
122:46 - badge icon so i'm just going to assume
122:48 - that he's verified in this case so
122:50 - i'm going to go ahead and do verify am i
122:53 - i don't even think i
122:54 - am actually let's go to twitter
122:58 - but i should be at some point no
123:01 - unfortunately i'm not but yeah yeah but
123:03 - put that badge icon next to me you know
123:04 - i've always wanted to see what that
123:06 - looks like
123:07 - yeah so now we'll have a verified batch
123:09 - it's not the exact same one that we're
123:11 - using
123:11 - we're using material ui's one as a sort
123:13 - of a as a replacement for it it's like a
123:15 - sort of shield
123:17 - verified outcome but you'll do a trick
123:18 - for this demo so we have this and then
123:20 - we'll say clever kazi there we go so
123:22 - boom all right and obviously after this
123:25 - oh
123:26 - damn my nan said missed man city versus
123:29 - real madrid for this awesome

126:46 - just going to import those at the top so
126:48 - i'm going to go up to the top of the
126:49 - file
126:50 - and boom import those at the top so save
126:54 - and now we should be able to see
126:58 - so if we save it we should be able to
127:00 - see
127:02 - uh yeah we can see the icons have popped
127:05 - in at the bottom right so that's really
127:06 - nice to see
127:07 - now what we're going to do is make all
127:09 - of this look nice right so
127:11 - we've already we've added in all the
127:13 - sort of the the selectors and everything
127:15 - now we're going to basically use css to
127:18 - make it
127:18 - look exactly as we want it right so
127:21 - let's go ahead and go to
127:23 - post dot css so post.css

127:46 - it so i checked has a web app
127:49 - out dude um i actually went to it and
127:51 - look at this
127:53 - i had to log in and it's actually a
127:55 - clone
127:56 - of twitter oh nice it's fully responsive
128:01 - oh dope so let's actually test it
128:05 - oh damn oh nice
128:08 - that's what i'm talking about wow guys

128:17 - yo if you guys like this make sure you
128:19 - go ahead and like the video
128:21 - this is awesome
128:26 - i did i did your one from yesterday
128:28 - wrong
128:30 - but we just started who can like slide
128:33 - it in the smoothness right
128:37 - that would be the best oh this week's uh
128:41 - smoothest sliding goes to
128:46 - nice yeah yesterday i dropped one guys
128:49 - if you didn't see it go ahead and check
128:51 - out yesterday's video
128:52 - sliding it in like this bro check this
128:54 - out
128:55 - go for it i'm sharing it on the screen
128:58 - sliding it in like oh
128:59 - let's go all right let's get back the
129:03 - collection
129:04 - enough of the jokes
129:07 - so now what we're going to do is firstly
129:09 - i'm going to go ahead and target that
129:10 - image right
129:11 - so image right now is inside post body
129:14 - so i'm going to go ahead and do
129:16 - post body and i'm going to say border
129:17 - radius of 20 pixels so firstly you'll
129:19 - see it'll get like a rounded effect on
129:21 - that image so if we go ahead and save it
129:23 - it gives a rounded effect but
129:24 - you see it's like it's currently getting
129:26 - bigger than the screen right now which
129:27 - we don't want right
129:29 - so i'm going to do width of 100 so width
129:31 - of a 100
129:33 - and that should give it a position which
129:35 - is going to be is going to be
129:36 - 100 relative of its container it should
129:39 - be
129:40 - in this case so if i go ahead and save
129:42 - that it should actually
129:44 - fit inside of its size
129:47 - so if we go ahead and make that smaller
129:49 - i'm just wondering did that
129:51 - no it didn't okay that's because we've
129:52 - got flex supplying okay no problem
129:54 - so we can do that so we don't actually
129:56 - need that in here at this point
129:58 - so you're going to take that out so
129:59 - let's go ahead and do the phone so we've
130:01 - made it sort of rounded in the corners
130:03 - but the actual container itself i want
130:04 - to do display flex
130:06 - right so display flex and then i'm going
130:08 - to do align items
130:09 - flex start so that way they all center
130:12 - at the top so align items
130:14 - um select start and then i'm going to
130:16 - give it a border bottom and a padding at
130:18 - the bottom as well so i'm going to go
130:20 - ahead and do that
130:20 - so following there we go
130:26 - oops my computer's getting a bit hot now
130:29 - so let me go ahead and save this might
130:31 - because i've got that gif
130:32 - running some reason yeah and then i've
130:35 - saved it
130:36 - i'm just going to use your screen as a
130:38 - reference nice yeah so
130:39 - there we go yeah and then i'm going to
130:41 - use uh as the box
130:45 - that is so jacked
130:48 - and now and for the footer what i'm
130:50 - going to do is you see all those icons
130:52 - right if i do display flex
130:54 - justify content space between and give
130:57 - it a little margin at the top
130:58 - that will actually go ahead and spread
130:59 - them out evenly so if i go ahead and do
131:02 - that
131:02 - it spreads about evenly which is really
131:03 - nice right and then what we're going to
131:06 - go ahead and do
131:06 - for the badge so i gave the badge um
131:10 - a class name of post badge so what i'm
131:12 - going to go ahead and do
131:14 - nice i see what you mean yeah it's it's
131:16 - over spread across evenly
131:17 - looks nice yes and so now you're going
131:20 - to make the badge blue
131:22 - yep so that badge i'm going to go ahead
131:23 - and do this so i'm going to say post
131:25 - badge keep an eye on that you bad boys
131:30 - how am i doing post badge on size of 14
131:33 - pixels
131:34 - and a color and i'm going to use the
131:35 - twitter color variable
131:37 - to go ahead and make it the blue this
131:39 - one is for the boys
131:40 - check it out look at that your boy has
131:44 - been verified let's
131:45 - go exactly it gives a nice little
131:48 - finishing touch there
131:50 - for the header sort of the the special
131:53 - text and that and what i'm referring to
131:54 - there
131:55 - is where we spanned remember we added a
131:58 - span so i need to actually go ahead and
131:59 - add a
132:00 - uh a class name there so where we span
132:03 - some text of where we had the username
132:05 - so i actually went and added a class
132:06 - name here post header special
132:09 - and what i'm going to do there is
132:10 - basically wherever we have the username
132:11 - and that stuff i want to just want to
132:12 - add a bit of styling there so i'm going
132:14 - to go ahead and say
132:15 - give it a fun weight of 600 a smaller
132:17 - font size and give it a gray color and
132:20 - now we should see where it says clever
132:21 - kazi
132:22 - that should change i need to save both
132:24 - files
132:28 - now as soon as that refreshes you see
132:29 - cleverkaze came a bit smaller which is
132:31 - nice
132:32 - right for the header text so i'm going
132:35 - to target so i'm going to go into that
132:37 - container
132:38 - target the header h3 and change the font
132:40 - size 15 pixels with the margin bottom
132:43 - you should see that i've changed as we
132:44 - did that it made rafe kazi
132:46 - a bit smaller with the margin underneath
132:48 - it and then we're also going to go ahead
132:50 - and add in
132:51 - for the description so the header
132:54 - description we have a margin
132:55 - bottom of 10 pixels and a font size of
132:58 - 15 pixels
132:59 - so that will go ahead and change that
133:02 - there we go
133:03 - nice for the post body i'm going to give
133:06 - it
133:06 - um a flex so i'm going to say
133:10 - display flag a flex type of one which it
133:13 - knows to use up
133:14 - as much as it can and then i'm going to
133:16 - say
133:17 - give it a padding of 10 pixels so that's
133:19 - why it's also pushed the things across
133:21 - to the right
133:22 - and then for the avatar just so that it
133:24 - right now it's super cramped
133:26 - all right so i'm just going to give it
133:27 - 20 pixel padding so
133:31 - boom there we go i'm going to go ahead
133:34 - and give it
133:35 - 20 pixels of padding and there you go so
133:37 - now if we make that full screen
133:39 - there you go yep
133:43 - nice check that out guys so that looks
133:45 - clean all right see it looks designed to
133:47 - look a lot more like a post
133:49 - right so now if i go and do
133:52 - for the header footer margin top did i
133:55 - do that yeah margin top
133:56 - make that margin up a little more
133:58 - drastic so 20 pixels maybe
134:00 - yeah so we get a bit more spacing there
134:02 - it's looking clean now bro
134:04 - yeah so it's starting to get that nice
134:05 - sort of feel to it um
134:08 - awesome so with that said now what we're
134:11 - going to be doing
134:13 - is moving to the so imagine now guys
134:16 - like if i have the feed
134:18 - right if i go ahead and like basically
134:20 - add a bunch of posts now
134:22 - right so they're all going to be the
134:23 - same post because i haven't actually
134:24 - passed through any props yet
134:26 - which we'll be doing later with with the
134:28 - firebase stuff so
134:29 - now you can see because if you open up
134:31 - the feed
134:35 - so check this out so boom we've got this
134:37 - nice little functionality right
134:39 - look at that so it's really clean
134:42 - really really nice layout um and you can
134:45 - see guys like
134:46 - very quickly you start to see an app
134:48 - right you can start to see a very
134:49 - functional app
134:50 - right so what we're going to do is we're
134:52 - going to touch base on the functionality
134:55 - side of things afterwards
134:56 - but what we're going to do for now is
134:58 - actually go over to the widgets
135:00 - so we actually just wrapped up on the
135:02 - feed right so we'll be coming back to
135:04 - the feed afterwards to sort of handle
135:06 - the functionality
135:08 - for now what we're going to do is move
135:09 - over to the widget
135:11 - so an app.js we have the last part which
135:15 - is widgets
135:16 - right so let's go ahead and update the
135:20 - text
135:23 - so on the screen now do what are we
135:26 - saying working on the widgets
135:28 - yeah nice so dope so then now what we're
135:31 - going to do inside of widgets
135:33 - widgets is essentially that right side
135:35 - and what we're going to do is we're
135:36 - actually going to do something pretty
135:37 - cool here we're going to use a few
135:38 - different plugins
135:39 - to go ahead and make this look the way
135:41 - we want it so
135:42 - uh that's the thing that's the thing
135:45 - that on this
135:46 - let me go to twitter oh man my
135:48 - computer's starting to freeze
135:50 - please don't die on me okay this is all
135:53 - that what's happening in who to follow
135:55 - section
135:56 - yeah exactly and in this case we're
135:59 - going to be pulling
136:00 - using a special library called react
136:02 - twitter embed right
136:04 - so what i'm going to firstly do is
136:05 - actually go ahead and install that in
136:07 - the console so
136:08 - um let me see if i can see so in the
136:11 - console if you if you do command j on
136:12 - the console
136:14 - give me one second i will do it right
136:16 - now boom
136:17 - there we go yep and now what i'm going
136:20 - to do is mpm oh so you need to open up
136:22 - uh
136:22 - the third console oh no wait the second
136:25 - one
136:26 - it's the second one um
136:33 - oh yeah there we go yeah so now when the
136:34 - mpmi i'm basically gonna do oh i need
136:37 - access one sec i need to
136:41 - i need how do i request access for that
136:43 - i do
136:44 - live share papa
136:48 - it's not even right you need write
136:50 - access yeah i got it
136:52 - yeah there you go you're good mpm i
136:56 - and i'm going to do react twitter embed
136:58 - right
136:59 - so show the yep so there we go npm i
137:02 - react to it
137:03 - so just do uh command b so they can see
137:05 - it yep you got it
137:07 - boom nice
137:10 - so back to him and we're gonna install
137:12 - that guys and basically
137:14 - that's going to give us three very handy
137:16 - so there's a bunch of things it gives us
137:18 - you guys can go
137:18 - ahead and check out the documentation on
137:20 - that uh library in npm
137:22 - but we're going to use a twitter
137:23 - timeline between a share button and the
137:25 - twitter
137:25 - tweet embed just so you guys can get a
137:27 - sort of
137:28 - feel for what it does right so we're
137:30 - going to come to that in a sec and
137:31 - that's going to take a minute to just
137:32 - install
137:33 - but before we do that what i'm going to
137:34 - do is add the search field right so at
137:37 - the top
137:38 - what i'm going to do is add the
137:39 - following source a div
137:41 - which has the class name of widgets
137:43 - input so here
137:44 - div widgets input and then i'm going to
137:47 - do
137:48 - this like this so
137:52 - and then what we're going to do is have
137:54 - inside of that a search icon
137:56 - with the class name of search icon and
137:58 - this is going to be pulled in from
137:59 - material ui so it's just going to be a
138:01 - search icon
138:02 - from the icon library so i'm going to go
138:04 - ahead and do that
138:06 - there we go and then i'm going to go
138:08 - ahead and grab an
138:09 - input field which has a switch which
138:12 - just says a placeholder of such
138:13 - twitter and it has type is text and
138:16 - we're using react
138:17 - yeah we're using react twitter embed so
138:19 - i've popped up alexandros
138:21 - comment on the screen and he's showing
138:22 - you guys what to write to install
138:24 - it npm i react twitter embed nice
138:28 - awesome yeah and now what we're going to
138:31 - do
138:31 - is we have that in place and then i'm
138:34 - going to go ahead and say
138:35 - another one i'm going to call this one
138:36 - the widgets widget container because
138:38 - this is the one that's going to make use
138:40 - of all of these sort of
138:42 - fun quirky uh sort of that plug-in that
138:44 - reacts with your embed stuff so
138:46 - yeah it's inside and quirky embed like
138:49 - this one over here
138:55 - the kids let and then let's add a h2
138:58 - which says
138:59 - what's happening right so we saw that
139:01 - was in the original one
139:03 - and then the first thing we're going to
139:04 - do guys is actually go ahead so right
139:06 - now what we might have to do cause is
139:08 - scroll to
139:09 - the right on the um on the
139:12 - local host so we can see what's
139:13 - happening
139:15 - all right and also i will put this down
139:18 - so you can have more view
139:20 - and let's go to the local host oh i see
139:23 - my
139:23 - fancy search functionality kicking in
139:27 - yeah what we might have to do now is
139:29 - make it
139:30 - possibly um push this on the left
139:34 - side and have the code on the right
139:35 - maybe um
139:37 - because it's not it's not going to show
139:39 - this part of the screen every time we
139:40 - just have the code
139:41 - here you can see on you i got you some
139:43 - yeah something like that yeah i got you
139:45 - i got
139:48 - oh snap son
139:51 - snap city let's go
139:55 - i mean i could have just scrolled it bro
139:56 - that would have been fine
139:58 - no no but now what happens is when it
140:00 - hot reload is going to jump back
140:02 - so you might actually have to make the
140:03 - window bigger and then
140:05 - sort of pop it you see i mean go into
140:07 - the left
140:09 - oh so make the window bigger i got yeah
140:11 - i got you
140:14 - here we go damn bro
140:17 - not only are we developers but know how
140:19 - to use the computer too
140:21 - yeah problem solvers
140:26 - so and then what we're going to do is
140:27 - i'm going to show you guys the first
140:29 - example which is called twitter embed
140:31 - right
140:32 - so i'm going to do this twitter embed
140:34 - right here and basically this is a tweet
140:35 - from qazi and it's basically a tweet
140:38 - regarding i think it was about the
140:39 - python
140:40 - it was a python post that you've done
140:41 - quite a while back i'm going to go ahead
140:43 - and save that
140:44 - and check this out so as soon as i do
140:46 - that we should actually see
140:48 - on the left side now see what's
140:50 - happening and in a second
140:55 - that looks right yeah i love that
140:58 - yeah so we get that as the first thing
141:00 - and the second one we're going to do
141:02 - this is actually a timeline feed from
141:04 - karzi's account so you can actually go
141:05 - ahead and change this with your
141:07 - twitter profile if you go ahead and
141:08 - change this the screen name
141:11 - and then you can also pass in options
141:12 - here if you want to change the styling
141:13 - of it
141:14 - so we're going to go ahead and add that
141:15 - one so if we save that in now that will
141:18 - actually show the latest tweets
141:19 - that are on kazi's account so there you
141:20 - go that's a real live stream of tweets
141:23 - what's happening right now
141:24 - so you can see it's pulling in the
141:26 - tweets of the bomb awesome
141:28 - steve is back his video call he had a
141:31 - meeting with his devs and now
141:33 - he's like the call is over the devs are
141:35 - happy let's get back to it
141:38 - nice awesome so now we are going to
141:41 - do um i'm going to paste in the twitter
141:44 - share button as well so
141:45 - that was kind of cool and it's just like
141:47 - an example of what you can do with
141:48 - these sort of packages this one if you
141:50 - click it it will take you to
141:51 - facebook.com for slash clever programmer
141:53 - and then the text says react.js is
141:55 - autumn
141:56 - via cleverkaze so now if you actually go
141:59 - ahead and scroll down
142:03 - uh because yes if you go ahead and
142:06 - scroll
142:15 - [ __ ] reaction speed can't spell
142:18 - reaction without react bro let's go
142:22 - see that twitter share button so if you
142:24 - scroll down on the the right side now
142:27 - so you see where it says what's
142:28 - happening on the action oh yeah yeah
142:30 - yeah
142:30 - no that looks clean you see the little
142:32 - tweet button at the bottom
142:34 - uh they can't see it so i'm gonna have
142:36 - to holy crap man i have to do some
142:38 - really weird stuff
142:41 - now it will be visible soon hopefully
142:46 - there now they should be able to see it
142:49 - so if you click that tweet button that
142:50 - will take you to twitter
142:52 - and you'll actually have a share post on
142:54 - it and it will actually attach
142:55 - the the the parameters that we passed in
142:58 - so it's really quite clever sort of
142:59 - plug-in
143:00 - damn i see it i see it
143:04 - and now everybody sees it too
143:07 - also right so that's just from that
143:09 - little simple like and guys this is an
143:10 - example of like
143:11 - using third-party libraries makes your
143:13 - life so much easier
143:15 - and it's something that you guys should
143:17 - definitely go ahead and do
143:18 - uh when you're coding so with that said
143:21 - let's go ahead and make this section
143:22 - really nice right so we went ahead and
143:24 - created a widgets.css
143:26 - so now i'm going to go ahead and do the
143:28 - following so
143:29 - i'm going to open up my widgets.css uh
143:32 - if my computer decides to
143:34 - breathe it's got a comment by epic zeus
143:36 - epic zeus is back in the house
143:40 - and epic zeus says i want to join profit
143:42 - with javascript training only thing that
143:44 - is keeping me away is the thought that
143:46 - are the training modules as interactive
143:49 - like these live videos what do you
143:52 - say sunny yeah so my advice here guys is
143:56 - the way i teach it
143:57 - or the way i sort of tell students is
143:59 - you should always have kind of a split
144:01 - right you should always have like a
144:03 - a sort of an area where you can go at
144:05 - your own pace and that's what we
144:06 - really built the training modules for
144:08 - you can take those training modules
144:10 - go through the fundamentals at your own
144:12 - pace which is really important right
144:14 - and then you have a third of your time
144:16 - with like when you for example with
144:18 - us and then the live clients on
144:20 - javascript
144:21 - yeah so we have those and that's where
144:23 - you really get pushed intensely
144:26 - right so really that we take you to that
144:27 - sort of uncomfortable stage
144:29 - um and then you also have like the other
144:32 - side where it's basically you
144:33 - start teaching other people so we teach
144:35 - you all of this in the course but that's
144:36 - the main purpose of to answer and to
144:38 - answer your question
144:39 - it's even more interactive because
144:41 - you're on a zoom call
144:43 - so sunny can actually see you we have
144:45 - you turn your video on as well
144:47 - sunny and nas all those calls so then
144:49 - you can actually speak back to us like
144:50 - right now there's
144:51 - massive engagement right we're sharing
144:53 - your comments imagine if you're in
144:54 - interface will be like hey epic zeus or
144:56 - whatever your real name is
144:58 - like did you get this thing done show me
145:00 - your code that's why it doesn't work
145:03 - this is why it's wrong this is what you
145:04 - can do to make you know what i mean like
145:06 - it's very just boom boom boom
145:08 - so yeah and we do like we really
145:11 - aggressively do call out students and we
145:13 - make sure everyone's progressing so
145:15 - something to definitely bear in mind if
145:16 - you're on the chance of joining
145:18 - nice so what we're going to do now is
145:21 - target
145:21 - and i love what vague says by the way so
145:24 - vivek says epic zeus is really good to
145:27 - be honest i've recently joined the
145:29 - course
145:29 - it motivates you to learn coding i will
145:32 - give five stars to the course
145:34 - amazing thank you so much vivek yeah
145:38 - glad you're enjoying it and i'll see you
145:39 - on the coaching call yeah yeah
145:41 - nice um let's go so
145:44 - now what we got is uh yeah so widgets
145:47 - input so i'm going to do display flex on
145:49 - the input so this should actually go
145:51 - ahead and i'm going to align item center
145:53 - give it a background color of the
145:55 - twitter background which is like a gray
145:57 - padding and here i'm going to pop it on
145:59 - and then you guys i'll explain it as we
146:00 - see it so
146:01 - i've done a bunch of styling some
146:02 - margins some border radius etc so now
146:04 - you'll see
146:05 - at the top the search has changed right
146:08 - but the input
146:09 - hey epic zeus i'm sorry bro i know you
146:12 - want to keep coding but i'll i'm sorry
146:14 - and
146:14 - to everybody else who's watching but
146:15 - this is too awesome episode says joining
146:18 - tomorrow
146:19 - let's go
146:22 - well as soon as you join we see it
146:24 - actually come through and uh we get on
146:26 - calls with a lot of the people who
146:27 - we get on a call with every single
146:28 - person that actually joins so if that
146:30 - happens we're going to give you a shout
146:31 - out and
146:32 - you're welcome to jump on the skype call
146:33 - with us or the live stream with us
146:36 - tomorrow too
146:38 - exactly yeah definitely do that and um
146:40 - yeah if you join like jump into the
146:42 - coaching coin tell me that
146:43 - tell me your your tag is fxus and i'll
146:45 - we'll have a chat
146:47 - nice um awesome
146:50 - leroy says if sonny was my javascripts
146:52 - uh in my college i would be starting
146:53 - react nine to five
146:55 - i love that thank you dude uh
146:58 - so i'm gonna go ahead and add so i'm
147:00 - gonna target the input field and i'm
147:02 - going to say
147:02 - give a border none and give the
147:04 - background color to be twitter
147:05 - background color as well so
147:06 - if i save this uh you'll see now that it
147:09 - blends in with that so all right so we
147:11 - get that
147:11 - uniform sort of look and the search icon
147:14 - just one shout out for everybody who
147:16 - wants to join profit with javascript
147:18 - uh this is not a marketing tactic we are
147:21 - the subscription plan we're probably
147:23 - actually gonna move away from it
147:25 - pretty soon so um probably in the next
147:29 - two weeks or less it's going to be gone
147:32 - and the only plan that's going to be
147:33 - there is going to be the one time full
147:35 - price and it's going to be somewhere
147:37 - like 500
147:38 - to higher than that so just something
147:40 - for you to be aware of if you're curious
147:42 - about it you know you can get it it's
147:43 - still a really good deal
147:46 - yeah exactly like guys like like if
147:48 - you're paying the current price
147:49 - now per month it's actually going to be
147:51 - easier for you guys to pay that as
147:53 - opposed to what it's going to become in
147:54 - the next two weeks so
147:55 - definitely go ahead and if you're on the
147:57 - fence consider joining now
147:59 - and you'll keep hold of that price by
148:00 - the way if you join now it won't change
148:02 - for you if you join
148:04 - yeah awesome so um what we're going to
148:07 - do now is also
148:08 - go ahead and style the search icon so
148:10 - i'm going to go ahead and do this
148:12 - so boom search icon and that tends to
148:15 - search i can color gray
148:18 - and then what i'm going to do is
148:19 - actually target the widgets container
148:22 - right so that container that holds
148:23 - everything that we have inside of it
148:25 - i'm going to go ahead and do widgets
148:26 - container and i'm going to do the
148:28 - following so margin top 15 pixels left
148:30 - 20 pixels padding around the entire
148:32 - inside
148:33 - 20 pixels background color of this off
148:36 - gray so it's not the typical twitter
148:37 - gray otherwise i would use the variable
148:39 - and the border radius of 20. now check
148:41 - this out
148:42 - kazi if you open up the uh the left
148:45 - screen so i can just see it a bit more
148:47 - yeah right here you got it as soon as i
148:49 - hit
148:49 - save now look at that container where it
148:51 - says what's happening
148:52 - and boom there you go it gets a lot more
148:56 - of a nicer
148:57 - ui to it right yeah and the final thing
148:59 - there guys
149:00 - to really wrap up that widget section is
149:02 - to target the what's happening text
149:05 - so i'm going to say font size of 18
149:06 - pixels front weight of 800 so it's
149:08 - slightly bolder
149:10 - and as soon as i do that there we go
149:12 - it's much nicer much smaller
149:14 - and that wraps up the widgets section so
149:17 - that's a really nice way to end the
149:19 - widget section
149:20 - um so this is exciting right now so
149:22 - we've actually got to a really cool
149:24 - point
149:24 - so we've showed you guys so let's go
149:25 - ahead and show them the uh the app right
149:28 - now because on full screen
149:29 - we don't need to do this weird sort of
149:30 - left side stuff anymore
149:32 - nice yeah so that's actually like so the
149:36 - app looks
149:37 - clean right now yeah damn yeah
149:40 - hey guys if you like how this app is
149:42 - looking and you like
149:44 - the app then go ahead and like the video
149:47 - that would be awesome thank you guys
149:51 - smash that thumbs up guys if you're
149:53 - still here as well amazing
149:55 - how many views are we on right now uh we
149:57 - are at
149:59 - right now oh snap doodle we just broke
150:02 - 20 000 views let's
150:04 - go i was wondering i was like yeah
150:08 - sure we must have cracked it by now yeah
150:10 - and uh we got the greatest ever saying
150:13 - it's amazing how long one can code when
150:14 - they have such amazing interfaces
150:16 - my apps are looking incredible and lol
150:19 - today i worked on them for eight plus
150:21 - hours
150:21 - again and still had great fun which was
150:24 - shocking
150:26 - do you know what i love that so much
150:27 - because the fact we're helping people
150:29 - motivate for like eight hours coding
150:31 - sprees
150:32 - is so nice to hear like really really
150:34 - cool to hear that
150:35 - so i love that i feel like and just us
150:38 - sitting here
150:39 - coding for like four hours or six hours
150:41 - straight
150:42 - i think it's also like developing that
150:44 - muscle in a lot of
150:46 - people who are watching that it's okay
150:48 - like look we're here doing it you can be
150:50 - doing it for six to ten hours a day no
150:53 - problem
150:53 - because i think that's actually one of
150:54 - the biggest advantages i feel like i had
150:57 - in coding i could just sit there for 15
150:59 - hours a day
151:00 - so it doesn't matter even if i'm like
151:02 - dumb and it takes me six
151:03 - hours just to even get started but by
151:06 - the time that i get started between six
151:08 - hours
151:08 - and the 15 hour mark i just fly
151:12 - yeah exactly definitely and i think
151:15 - you're right like it does
151:16 - it helps build that confidence with a
151:17 - lot of people when it comes to those
151:19 - longer hour sessions
151:20 - because we're doing it right here in
151:21 - front of you guys um
151:23 - so we're not just saying that we code
151:25 - for 10 hours we're literally doing it
151:26 - here
151:27 - with you guys david says please what's
151:30 - the duration of the entire profit
151:31 - javascript program guys
151:32 - it's uh the the training material that
151:35 - should last you three months
151:37 - okay and so three months of training
151:40 - is gonna get you where you need to go
151:42 - and you're gonna start being able to
151:43 - earn an
151:43 - income if you put in the work after the
151:46 - three months
151:47 - the program will still continue for you
151:49 - because we're gonna be giving you the

154:43 - sure you go to firebase.com
154:45 - go to the console and then create a new
154:47 - app we just called it twitter clone
154:49 - now once we're in here we're going to
154:50 - hit this web button and i'm going to go

155:24 - may come through in a sec what's the
155:26 - name
155:28 - uh let me see
155:32 - it doesn't tell me yeah it doesn't tell
155:34 - me it just got an email that pinged
155:35 - through
155:36 - so we should get it while we're on the
155:37 - stream the name damn nice okay
155:40 - all right we're just waiting for them to
155:41 - make their username you know and then as
155:43 - soon as their username
155:44 - it'll send us yeah all right firebase
155:46 - wait
155:47 - what happened next next cool guys make
155:50 - sure you use this and install firebase
155:51 - tools we're not gonna do this command
155:53 - because we already have
155:54 - it installed and then just the three
155:55 - commands are going to be useful later on
155:57 - and now i'm going to continue to console
155:59 - now what are we doing sonny are we going
156:01 - to uh project settings
156:03 - yes project settings and we need to grab
156:05 - the config
156:07 - cool so we got a web app at the top and
156:09 - i'm going to go ahead and
156:10 - grab this config and now i'm going to
156:13 - put this on this side
156:15 - guys go here bada bam bada boom create
156:18 - is
156:18 - firebase.js okay firebase.js
156:24 - and pop in all your config stuff right
156:26 - in here and then what's next sunny
156:29 - exactly so that's the next step guys and
156:31 - then what we're going to do is open up
156:32 - the terminal
156:34 - and what we need to do now is actually
156:35 - pull in firebase
156:37 - into the into our project so we do mpmi
156:40 - firebase oh my bad my bad bro my bad
156:43 - hold on that's not gonna work
156:46 - yep i got overzealous that's right i'm
156:47 - typing it in
156:50 - mpmi firebase there oh god damn it oops
156:53 - that's not going to work either
156:54 - let me go ahead let me do it ctrl z
156:57 - there we go
156:58 - mpm i firebase there we go
157:02 - um so once we do that guys
157:05 - uh it's going to pull in all of this
157:07 - stuff so while while that's actually
157:08 - loading we can actually go ahead and
157:09 - carry on
157:10 - um so let's go and find that firebase
157:13 - file that kazi created
157:14 - awesome and what we're going to do is
157:15 - we're going to import firebase from
157:17 - firebase at the top of that file
157:18 - so i'm going to go to the top i'm going
157:20 - to say import firebase from firebase
157:22 - and then underneath what i'm going to
157:23 - say is basically this is
157:25 - very powerful guys we've done this in
157:26 - the previous tutorials as well but just
157:28 - to show you guys how easy it is to
157:30 - connect
157:31 - everything together because you're going
157:32 - to scroll down a little bit so we can
157:34 - see
157:34 - the um yeah right there there's actually
157:37 - we can do come on j we can actually
157:38 - close the um
157:40 - let's do it yeah boom so firebase app
157:44 - firebase initialize app and firebase
157:46 - config so that's the firebase config
157:48 - right there
157:48 - boom now this is pretty much our like
157:50 - portable database okay we're just gonna
157:52 - put in our pocket
157:53 - and then any other file that we go to
157:55 - app.js or anything else
157:57 - we can actually just use this firebase
158:00 - app
158:00 - so we can just use that database
158:02 - variable and then we'll have access to
158:04 - it boom right there so that db yeah
158:06 - we're just carrying in our pocket this

158:41 - we've got the db right so we initialize
158:43 - the app and basically what we did there
158:45 - is we basically connected firebase
158:47 - to the backend so very very simple stuff
158:49 - uh
158:50 - very very simple because of firebase
158:52 - right and then exporting it allows us to
158:54 - basically go into any file
158:56 - and pull the database in right so that's
158:58 - what we're going to basically go ahead
159:00 - thank you so much ritik for the donation

159:38 - it's literally as simple as that guys
159:40 - right
159:40 - to access the db so now we need to go
159:42 - back to firebase
159:43 - and we need to go ahead and set up the
159:46 - database classy
159:48 - okay beautiful um yeah so i'm going to
159:52 - go ahead what do you mean

160:02 - soon buddy so that's pretty awesome
160:04 - all right so now guys make sure you
160:06 - click database on the left hand side
160:07 - here here
160:08 - cloud firestore real-time updates
160:10 - powerful queries and automatic scaling
160:12 - just hit
160:13 - create database right there make sure
160:15 - you start in test mode
160:16 - hit next leave that default
160:20 - hit done yeah wait for it
160:24 - and then as soon as this is done we can
160:26 - actually start using a real-time
160:27 - database and you guys will see how easy
160:29 - that thing is
160:30 - that thing is freaking sick yeah unkit
160:32 - sharma best channel
160:34 - for react nice we love that dude
160:38 - awesome right so what we're going to do
160:42 - now guys is i'm just going to go ahead
160:45 - and we
160:45 - need here is the line 14. he says can
160:47 - you show us line 14
160:49 - can't see it here it is okay i'm showing
160:51 - it a lot so you guys can just pause it
160:52 - rewind dj with it but it's there
160:55 - nice awesome so what you do now
160:59 - uh-huh go for it yeah so before we
161:02 - actually mess around with the database
161:03 - anymore we need to do a little bit of
161:05 - refactoring so
161:06 - we actually had the post right the post
161:09 - was using
161:10 - like the display name username verified
161:12 - text image avatar right
161:14 - but we hard-coded those values so cause
161:16 - you just go ahead and pop open the code
161:18 - uh pop okay so these are hard-coded
161:20 - right this is what you're talking about
161:22 - yes yes and we wanna be pulling it from
161:24 - our own database
161:27 - yeah we wanna do that but first we need
161:28 - to actually be able to pass through the
161:30 - props
161:31 - right so we need to show let's show the
161:33 - code for a sec
161:34 - so we have the post right so uh you need
161:37 - to follow me i think yep
161:38 - right there there we go so now
161:41 - guys we see we've got the display name
161:43 - user all this stuff
161:45 - as props right and what we're going to
161:47 - do now is inside of our
161:49 - feed you see we're just rendering out at
161:51 - the same post every time right
161:53 - now what we want to do instead is i can
161:55 - remove these comments we'll do instead
161:57 - now is i want to go ahead and pass
161:58 - through the props
161:59 - so you can see we've got a bunch of
162:01 - props here so in this case
162:02 - let's go ahead and say display name so
162:06 - display name equals in this case let's
162:08 - do uh
162:09 - sunny sanger and then let's do username
162:13 - oops username equals let's just do
162:16 - my instagram so sssanga uh
162:20 - and then let's just do verified so i
162:22 - don't even have
162:23 - a verification but let's just call
162:25 - myself verified
162:26 - text in this case to say let's just say
162:29 - yo it's working so let me go ahead and
162:31 - drop this
162:31 - it's easy to see so what is this
162:33 - verified verified is equal to verified
162:35 - is that what that is
162:37 - no that if you do a boolean basically
162:39 - that got it that's true
162:40 - yeah so here we can say yo it's working
162:44 - right and then uh
162:47 - i'm gonna basically have uh for the
162:49 - avatar what i'm gonna do is just keep
162:51 - the same type of program i want
162:53 - so i'm going to say avatar let's just do
162:56 - avatar
162:58 - equals the cover program one and then
163:00 - i'm going to say
163:01 - for the image we're going to go ahead
163:04 - and use the one that we used before so
163:06 - that gif
163:06 - so image equals that same gif that we
163:09 - used before
163:11 - right so it's going to be that i choose
163:13 - you gif
163:14 - that one okay so awesome now here we
163:17 - basically pass in
163:18 - a bunch of props but inside of our post
163:20 - we need to actually change our code so
163:22 - that it uses them right
163:23 - so now what we can do is we for the
163:25 - source here rather than actually hard
163:27 - coding this value
163:28 - we can actually go here and do the
163:29 - following we can say this
163:31 - should be the avatar right yeah
163:34 - then we can say instead of rafae kazi
163:37 - here i'm going to say display name
163:39 - uh-huh instead of clever quasi i'm going
163:42 - to say at
163:43 - username
163:47 - yep oh instead of text here i'm going to
163:50 - say at text
163:54 - and then the image so you can see guys
163:56 - now we're just feeding through the props
163:58 - right so it's very simple we're just
163:59 - feeding through the props
164:00 - um and also for the verified i'm going
164:04 - to do is i'm going to add a condition
164:05 - now so i'm going to say if you're
164:06 - verified
164:08 - only then do we show it so i'm going to
164:09 - say if you're verified so if
164:12 - uh so verified and and that's how we do
164:15 - it that's how we say
164:16 - if you're verified then show the
164:18 - verified badge otherwise don't know
164:21 - so now we're using all of our props and
164:23 - now if i go ahead
164:25 - [Music]
164:26 - if i remove these old posts now we
164:29 - should see now if i
164:30 - save it and i save the post.js i need to
164:34 - save both
164:34 - post.js and feed.js and we should see
164:38 - like sunnysanga yo it's working
164:40 - nice oh i see
164:43 - beautiful beautiful beautiful where is
164:45 - that coming from
164:48 - so that's coming through uh the props
164:50 - now so you see like
164:51 - it says got it that's coming through the
164:53 - props okay i see but not the database
164:54 - yet
164:55 - okay got it not the database yeah right
164:58 - so
164:58 - now what we want is we basically that
165:01 - was the first step right
165:02 - refactor it so we can pass in props now
165:04 - instead of
165:05 - passing these values in here i want to
165:08 - basically have it so that it pulls from
165:09 - the database
165:10 - and it doesn't just pull one post it
165:12 - could pull like 50 100 whatever it does
165:15 - and it just renders them out
165:16 - right so we're going to show you just
165:19 - how simple that is to do that
165:21 - right now guys so get ready um
165:24 - for what i'll show you so next place we
165:26 - need a piece of state
165:27 - right to keep track of the post so what
165:29 - we're going to do is we're going to use
165:30 - state
165:31 - so inside of um this is how we write
165:34 - variables inside of react
165:36 - so here i'm going to say sunny one i'm
165:38 - going to take on one question
165:40 - i think it's uh helpful for more
165:42 - advanced developers who are watching
165:44 - this channel
165:44 - so daniel soliado says hey i have one
165:47 - more question would i be able to
165:48 - integrate payment to a website with just
165:51 - react and without backend code
165:53 - or would i need to use something like
165:54 - node.js cloud functions
165:57 - so if you guys want to add integrate
165:59 - payments and things like that you will
166:00 - need
166:01 - backend code you will need server side
166:03 - functionality
166:04 - but instead of using node.js what which
166:06 - is something that is super
166:08 - amazing that you can do is use
166:11 - firebase's
166:12 - cloud functions so you just use google
166:14 - cloud functions and that
166:16 - will make they'll give you the full pure
166:18 - back-end functionality you're looking
166:20 - for
166:20 - and you know the code is super simple
166:23 - when you're using firebase
166:26 - exactly yeah so you will need some back
166:28 - end to that and you can use a
166:29 - firebases cloud functions as far as you
166:31 - said uh we've actually done that so it
166:34 - does
166:34 - it we it's proof that it works um
166:36 - definitely go ahead and check that out
166:38 - yeah
166:39 - nice so now what we're going to do is so
166:41 - we've got cons posts
166:43 - which is the name of the variable then
166:44 - we write set whatever the variable is
166:46 - called to set posts in this case
166:48 - and then we need to initialize it so we
166:50 - say use state which is something called
166:51 - a hook
166:52 - and this is basically preparing the
166:53 - variable and we're going to say that the
166:55 - default value should be an empty array
166:57 - now to use this we need to go ahead and
166:59 - do this we need to say first you get rid
167:01 - of that
167:01 - i need to import it so i'm going to say
167:03 - import from react the use state
167:05 - right nice and then save prettier makes
167:08 - it look nice
167:09 - and then what we're gonna do is we're
167:11 - actually gonna so i'm not gonna i want
167:13 - this to be our posts right
167:15 - but what we're gonna do now is so let's
167:16 - go over to firebase
167:20 - right so yeah yeah yeah let's go over to
167:23 - firebase now
167:24 - so guys in firebase in the database you
167:26 - have a collection right so in this case
167:28 - what is the collection going to be it's
167:29 - going to be posts right
167:31 - so in this case let's go ahead and
167:32 - create a collection called posts
167:34 - yep and then cardi what's happening here
167:40 - and now guys inside of a post there are
167:42 - going to be like multiple
167:43 - other data points that are going to go
167:45 - in there so it's like
167:46 - what does a post have so in this case
167:48 - our post has
167:49 - a username our post ha oh this is a
167:52 - username right here right
167:54 - our post use the props as your reference
167:58 - right you can use the props as a
167:59 - reference exactly
168:01 - yep so in this case because remember
168:04 - your props it has to match your props uh
168:07 - the keys of your props boom
168:10 - nice so in this case let's go ahead and
168:12 - we can maybe change the value yeah nice
168:14 - awesome
168:15 - so each documents you have a collection
168:17 - and then you have documents inside the
168:19 - collection
168:20 - and each document in this case is going
168:21 - to resemble a post now display name is
168:23 - going to be string username is going to
168:25 - be a string this is going to be a
168:26 - boolean because true or false by def
168:28 - right now we're just gonna set it to be
168:30 - false uh
168:31 - true i mean and then username i'm gonna
168:34 - pop that in
168:35 - display name we're gonna pop that in and
168:38 - then
168:38 - uh what else do we need here so we need
168:41 - uh this is just gonna be a string
168:44 - so so let's just say uh yo it's pulling
168:46 - from firebase or something
168:47 - so that way we know it's coming from
168:49 - firebase
168:55 - nice there we go all right avatar this
168:58 - is going to be
169:00 - just a string and we're going to pop
169:02 - this in right there
169:03 - and then for the image this
169:06 - is also going to be a string and we're
169:10 - going to pop this
169:10 - in right over here cool and if i paste
169:13 - this
169:14 - this is the image so you guys are going
169:16 - to see that
169:17 - or sorry that's the avatar and then this
169:19 - is going to be the image that you guys
169:20 - are going to see
169:22 - yeah dope so this is good i'm going to
169:25 - hit save
169:27 - and now we have created a document
169:30 - so post at the highest level you guys at
169:33 - the highest level we got posts
169:35 - post inside of it right that's a
169:36 - collection inside of it you got
169:39 - documents so you know we got now one
169:42 - post
169:42 - we'll have multiple posts inside of our
169:44 - post collection
169:46 - exactly yeah if we make it full screen i
169:49 - think the firebase ui is a little bit
169:51 - easier to see
169:52 - yeah um there we go yeah so you've got a
169:55 - post and you've got the documents inside
169:57 - the post
169:57 - yep yeah and then they got data inside
170:00 - each document
170:02 - exactly yeah so really nice
170:05 - and now what we're going to do guys is
170:07 - we're going to basically do the magic
170:09 - which is going to connect
170:10 - so we already done the config which
170:13 - allowed us to connect to the database
170:14 - but now we're going to basically set up
170:16 - a listener
170:17 - which is going to be listening to that
170:18 - exact collection posts
170:21 - and anytime a document is added or
170:23 - whatever is in there currently
170:25 - we want a real-time listener which is
170:27 - going to update the posts in our state
170:28 - so inside of our react app and then that
170:30 - way we're going to render it out
170:31 - afterwards and it's always going to be
170:33 - real-time connected to our database
170:35 - right so let's go back to the code
170:38 - yeah nice
170:41 - and what we're going to do now is we're
170:43 - going to use effect so use effect
170:45 - basically is a piece of code
170:46 - that runs based on a given condition
170:49 - right and in this case
170:50 - the condition if we put empty brackets
170:53 - basically says
170:54 - run when the feed component loads so run
170:57 - any code that's inside of here
170:59 - so around any of this code whenever the
171:01 - feed component loads and don't run it
171:02 - again
171:03 - after right but if i was to put
171:05 - something like a name variable
171:07 - or anything in here like name age
171:09 - whenever run it when the feed component
171:11 - loads
171:12 - as well as when name the the name
171:14 - variable changes or the age
171:16 - variable changes so it's very powerful
171:18 - block of code a use effect right
171:20 - and we need to import it as well so at
171:22 - the top we can say use effect
171:24 - and then here we do some very very
171:26 - powerful stuff now so firstly
171:28 - we need to import the db from our local
171:31 - firebase file
171:32 - so you'd say import db from local
171:34 - firebase file so not the not the module
171:36 - firebase but the local file
171:38 - and then what we're going to say is db
171:40 - dot collection
171:41 - right so we're going to go to that
171:42 - collection and the one that we created
171:44 - was called
171:45 - posts inside of the collection inside of
171:47 - the database i'm going to say on
171:48 - snapshot
171:50 - so this is super powerful right now on
171:51 - snapchat and we say snapshot
171:53 - basically this gives us back a snapshot
171:55 - of david so imagine we just took a
171:57 - picture of the database right
171:58 - so it's listening and anytime that data
172:00 - changes or deletes or anything
172:02 - it basically grabs the snapshot and
172:04 - gives it to you so this piece of code
172:05 - that i'm about to write fires off
172:07 - and here what we're doing is we're
172:09 - saying set the post so set the
172:11 - the variable inside of react so set this
172:13 - variable right here
172:15 - to the value inside of here so if i set
172:17 - this it'll be empty but we don't want it
172:19 - to use that we want to use the snapshot
172:21 - so the actual database documents
172:23 - so we're going to say go and get all the
172:24 - docs that came back in that snapshot
172:26 - and then map through it and say for
172:28 - every single dock
172:30 - map and get me the dock data so the dock
172:33 - data is all of those fields that kazi
172:35 - added so
172:36 - the display name the avatar the image
172:38 - the text all of that stuff
172:40 - and what this will do is this will give
172:42 - you an array
172:44 - of all of the posts inside of the
172:46 - database
172:47 - right so all of the data it will be
172:49 - basically bubbled up into an array
172:50 - we set that as our posts so in this case
172:53 - now
172:55 - so guys just to visually show you guys
172:57 - because i think this is the part which
172:59 - just
172:59 - gets the most confusing so first yep
173:03 - okay just think about it super simply
173:05 - collection
173:08 - posts here i'm accessing posts so this
173:11 - one line over this line over here
173:13 - gets me access to this guy here post
173:15 - okay
173:17 - then when i do snapshot docs.map
173:20 - and this dock over here it allows me to
173:23 - loop through each document
173:25 - so first i'm looping through this
173:26 - document then
173:28 - if i had another post it would allow me
173:30 - to loop through that post as well so
173:31 - imagine i had
173:32 - you know one more post there if i had a
173:34 - third post like maybe
173:36 - a post here by barack obama here i have
173:38 - a post by
173:40 - you know i don't know kim kardashian
173:43 - that doc will give you access to each of
173:45 - them
173:45 - okay and then the last part of this
173:48 - thing
173:48 - is the doc.data when you do
173:52 - data this will actually get you access
173:54 - to this entire
173:55 - object okay yeah so the data will
173:58 - contain
173:59 - all of those things so then later you
174:01 - can do things like
174:02 - um you know dot avatar and it'll get you
174:05 - this one or
174:06 - dot display name and you'll get access
174:08 - to this one
174:09 - so i think this one line is oftentimes
174:11 - the most confusing to most people
174:14 - but yeah basically what it's allowing
174:15 - you to do in simple terms is just get
174:17 - access to every single post and all of
174:21 - their data
174:23 - exactly so super important uh point then
174:26 - i think cardi explains it really well
174:27 - when he does that
174:29 - um so literally guys what that's doing
174:31 - is yeah it's mapping to
174:32 - our state inside of our app and that
174:35 - means that
174:36 - greatest ever is saying so people were
174:38 - asking hey is profit would react also
174:40 - inside of this
174:41 - guys so profit with javascript will
174:43 - contain a lot of react stuff in there
174:45 - too and we're going to keep on adding
174:47 - things even if they're not there right
174:49 - now that's our long-term vision with
174:51 - sunny and i
174:51 - that's why sunny joined the team so he
174:53 - can actually bring in a lot of react
174:55 - to clever programmer so yeah greatest
174:58 - ever so should one wait for them to be
175:00 - added because i really love react
175:02 - stuff but what i get in is that look
175:04 - we're gonna you first of all you need to
175:05 - learn
175:06 - the fundamentals of javascript before
175:08 - you just jump into react so we're gonna
175:10 - give you all the fundamentals of
175:11 - javascript
175:12 - and yes we're gonna be adding in a ton
175:14 - of react to that course
175:16 - because it's gonna still react it's just
175:19 - a javascript library
175:21 - yeah so we're gonna give you access to
175:24 - react basically just allows you to
175:26 - supercharge your javascript skills and
175:28 - everything you're doing with javascript
175:30 - so we're going to add that into the
175:32 - program as well and you still have live
175:34 - weekly coaching calls directly with
175:36 - sunny
175:37 - so yes you are going to be building
175:38 - react stuff the instant you join the
175:40 - program
175:42 - yeah so literally every single tuesday
175:45 - we pretty much i run a react coaching
175:47 - call so you're gonna get
175:48 - extremely um yeah you're gonna get
175:51 - extreme intense
175:52 - react sessions in those in those calls
175:54 - where it's a zoom call
175:56 - so what like literally you can ask me
175:57 - any questions you can jump in
175:59 - we run through demos we run through any
176:01 - sort of problems or we kind of go over
176:02 - like somebody just said use callback
176:04 - so if if those questions pop up we run
176:06 - through anything that needs to be sort
176:08 - of go through
176:08 - and it's super intense so it's really
176:10 - really good from the get-go
176:12 - definitely recommend you check it out
176:13 - yeah
176:15 - beautiful nice so we just populated
176:18 - posts
176:19 - from the database right so now rather
176:21 - than rendering it from
176:23 - uh like like how we've hard-coded it on
176:25 - 925
176:26 - instead what i'm going to do is i'm
176:27 - going to say posts dot map
176:29 - i'm going to say for every single post
176:31 - that we go through i want to render
176:34 - a post component right
176:37 - but now what i'm going to be doing is
176:39 - i'm not going to be so imagine like
176:41 - we're pulling this component right so
176:42 - imagine we're doing this
176:44 - but instead of writing this like this i
176:46 - don't want to now basically oh oops that
176:49 - shouldn't be like that should be open
176:50 - bracket
176:51 - yeah so now i don't want to actually
176:53 - have it so that
176:55 - oh my god what happened here okay so
176:57 - there we go
176:58 - now instead of doing this i'm going to
177:00 - say uh
177:02 - post dot display name
177:07 - yeah display name and basically do this
177:09 - do
177:10 - do that for every single one but you
177:11 - could do this or actually we will do
177:13 - this i want your destructuring at this
177:14 - point because it will be a bit confusing
177:16 - do post dot username right and then here
177:19 - we do post.verified so this is basically
177:21 - getting the database values now so
177:23 - saying post.verified
177:25 - and then here post.text so post.text
177:29 - and then here post avatar
177:33 - post dot avatar and then here
177:36 - so post avatar
177:40 - and then here we say post dot image
177:44 - right so now if i save this so as soon
177:46 - as i save this guys if we did everything
177:48 - correct
177:49 - so cause let's go ahead and get our app
177:51 - on the right so as soon as i save this
177:53 - now it should be able to connect to the
177:54 - database
177:56 - pull that in now it should say yo it's
177:58 - pulling from firebase or whatever we
178:00 - change that to right so if i go ahead
178:01 - and save this
178:04 - so now it should refresh and we should
178:06 - be pulling this information
178:07 - from uh firebase now so let's hope it
178:10 - all goes well
178:11 - god damn da da da
178:20 - opposite of test driven development hey
178:25 - you don't need to do it when you're this
178:26 - jacked so
178:29 - i'm gonna just show you guys what's
178:30 - happening here this is pretty freaking
178:32 - insane
178:33 - so boom look at this guys all right step
178:37 - one our avatar
178:39 - is being pulled from the database
178:42 - our display name is being pulled
178:46 - from the database our username our text
178:49 - every single thing
178:51 - want me to prove it to you watch this
178:53 - i'm going to go over here
178:54 - change this to bunny banga
178:58 - instead hit that
179:02 - boom look at that real-time baby
179:05 - no refresh no nothing guys if you like
179:08 - that one i thought that was pretty
179:09 - freaking sick
179:10 - go ahead and smash that like button
179:12 - break it on your computer
179:14 - you don't need the left click button
179:15 - anyway
179:17 - [Laughter]
179:19 - nice exactly guys like real-time
179:23 - connection to the database
179:25 - uh yeah i just think that's amazing nick
179:27 - and
179:28 - guys there's so much that goes under the
179:29 - hood of that but it's literally like a
179:31 - few lines of code to get that working
179:33 - which just blows my mind every time
179:36 - this is amazing i've literally never
179:38 - watched a youtube live session for this
179:40 - long
179:40 - let's go let's go awesome below our cram
179:44 - says it's firebase free
179:45 - all of this stuff is free you only need
179:48 - to start
179:49 - putting a card on the account when you
179:50 - start doing things like cloud functions
179:52 - even then it's generate
179:53 - massively free
179:56 - [ __ ] sound yeah trump
179:59 - there's a lot of free stuff inside of
180:01 - there guys um
180:03 - yeah so and i actually stole all of the
180:06 - uh sort of like if i ever have a
180:08 - portfolio or something i actually host
180:09 - everything on firebase
180:10 - and then i'll actually have my portfolio
180:12 - on firebase so yeah
180:13 - definitely go ahead and use it um nice
180:17 - right so let's go ahead
180:20 - and check this out i just sent uh i just
180:23 - sent
180:24 - frank a message actually just right now
180:28 - so yeah we'll see if he sends me a text
180:30 - back but he joined us i shot him over a
180:32 - text
180:32 - i love when i see the blue you know
180:34 - because iphone so it makes me really
180:36 - happy
180:37 - nice
180:40 - but let's keep going nice awesome so
180:44 - what we're going to do now is actually
180:46 - connect
180:47 - that top tweet box where it says what's
180:49 - happening
180:50 - we're going to basically make it so that
180:52 - when we type in there
180:54 - and when we enter an optional image url
180:56 - and hit tweet
180:57 - it's going to go ahead and post a tweet
180:58 - and we're going to basically post it as
180:59 - rafikaze so we're going to assume that
181:01 - they signed in as him right
181:03 - yeah so so now we're done with the re so
181:05 - hold on
181:06 - we're done with add real-time database
181:08 - with firebase now what are we working on
181:11 - we are working on um posting
181:14 - a tweet at ability to post a tweet
181:18 - yeah post a tweet to the database yeah
181:20 - post
181:21 - a tweet
181:25 - nice okay i like it says yeah it's the
181:28 - first time i've glued to a live like
181:29 - this you guys rock
181:30 - appreciate that dude love the fact
181:32 - you've been here watching nice
181:35 - nice good
181:38 - i love that
181:42 - okay cool i've changed everything now
181:44 - we're back to coding yeah
181:46 - yep boom let's go so now what we're
181:49 - gonna do
181:50 - is we have um
181:53 - the right yes so the tweet box so
181:56 - we have some text inside of what's
181:59 - happening so that input field and we
182:00 - also have an input field where it says
182:02 - optional enter an image url
182:04 - so first thing we need to fix is create
182:06 - two pieces of
182:07 - state that keep track right so it's
182:10 - going to keep
182:10 - track of what the user is typing in so
182:13 - let's go ahead and handle the first one
182:15 - hey frank just responded back and he
182:18 - goes
182:18 - let's go so ready to crush it and react
182:22 - nice amazing dude
182:25 - see you guys like we get we literally
182:27 - see as soon as you join and we will talk
182:29 - to you jump on cause
182:30 - everything it's all one to one nice
182:34 - so we're gonna go ahead and create the
182:36 - piece of state now so
182:37 - here we say for the input i'm gonna go
182:39 - ahead and call it the input so let's
182:41 - just say
182:42 - uh tweet message right
182:45 - and it was a set tweet message tweet
182:48 - message
182:49 - and i'm gonna say you stay and initially
182:52 - this will be a blank value right so
182:53 - it'll be a blank string so i'm gonna go
182:55 - ahead and import this we don't freak out
182:57 - go ahead and do this
182:59 - nice and then i'm going to go ahead and
183:01 - connect it to the input field so what we
183:03 - need to do to connect
183:04 - is the greatest ever the greatest ever
183:07 - says
183:07 - the fact that we are not moving from our
183:09 - screens and feeling the need to is just
183:11 - a testament to how great this teaching
183:13 - is
183:14 - and this applies to all the amazing
183:16 - teachers on cp thank you
183:18 - prem prem sagar just donated
183:22 - five new zealand dollars and he goes
183:27 - sunny kazi love from auckland beautiful
183:29 - and he goes you guys are doing an
183:31 - amazing
183:31 - awesome job finally i'm confident and
183:33 - react after watching your clone series
183:35 - hey let's go i think it's time for my
183:38 - horns
183:41 - thank you dude and we are we love the
183:43 - fact you're more confident with it after
183:45 - watching our stuff that's awesome to
183:46 - hear
183:47 - yeah nice uh somebody just asked so
183:51 - rodin danny says why don't you use
183:52 - express express.js for back-end guys
183:54 - did you see how much code we wrote to
183:56 - get that working
183:57 - it was like a few lines of code which is
183:59 - why we didn't use express like for a
184:01 - back-end so
184:02 - this is a major reason of using firebase
184:04 - uh it's so powerful
184:06 - gives you a real-time functionality out
184:08 - of the box and it's just
184:09 - insane with how little code you write
184:12 - the functionality that you get so
184:14 - that's my answer to that yeah so now
184:17 - what we're going to do is we're going to
184:18 - map the value here so to that tweet
184:20 - message in the state
184:21 - but it's gonna be stuck now so if you
184:24 - cause if you go ahead and try and type
184:25 - in what's happening
184:26 - what happens when i try to type
184:31 - no nothing yep nothing right because
184:34 - what we're doing is we're mapping tweet
184:36 - message which is
184:37 - set to blank to that input field so what
184:40 - we need to do to get a map
184:41 - to get it reacting to your input is we
184:43 - say on change which basically fires off
184:46 - an event every time we type
184:47 - i'm going to say set the tweet message
184:50 - so i'm going to say set the tweet
184:51 - message every single time you type
184:53 - to become e.target.value which is
184:56 - basically what you type in
184:58 - right now if you try and type for me so
185:01 - let me go ahead and save it
185:03 - now if you try and type what happens hey
185:05 - let's go i can type my fifi and i can
185:07 - type fubar
185:09 - nice awesome so now what we're going to
185:12 - do is we're going to create another
185:13 - piece of state so i'm going to create
185:15 - another one to keep track of the image
185:16 - so i'm going to say tweet
185:18 - image tweet image there we go
185:21 - and for this one i'm going to go ahead
185:23 - and map it so i'm going to say value
185:25 - equals tweet image
185:26 - so tweet image right i'm going to say on
185:30 - change
185:30 - we need to do the same thing we can say
185:31 - on change oops
185:34 - unchange equals set tree image so set uh
185:37 - sorry e so it's going to be arrow
185:39 - function and it says set
185:41 - tweet image to be e dot target dot value
185:45 - right awesome nice now what we can do is
185:48 - because we've done that
185:49 - right and because everything is inside
185:50 - of a form when we hit enter
185:52 - the button type should be submit because
185:54 - we want this to be our submit button for
185:56 - a function
185:57 - and basically what we want to do is we
185:59 - need to add on click so basically when i
186:00 - submit or when i click that button
186:02 - what am i going to do i'm going to say
186:03 - here send tweet right so we're going to
186:06 - create a function called send tweet
186:08 - and here what i want to do is i want to
186:10 - say const send tweet and this is going
186:12 - to be an arrow function so it takes
186:14 - an event which because whenever you
186:15 - click a button it dispatches an event
186:18 - because we're inside of a form guys it's
186:20 - going to refresh the page
186:22 - right so in order to stop that because
186:25 - in react you don't want to do refreshes
186:27 - right so you need to do e
186:28 - dot prevent default and this will
186:30 - prevent
186:31 - so you need to pass e as a parameter so
186:33 - send tweet is being passed in the button
186:34 - on click
186:36 - and then what you need to do is say e
186:37 - dot prevent default massively impossible
186:40 - says you guys are crazy love you guys
186:42 - keep it up you're helping me making my
186:45 - dream projects thank you so so so much
186:47 - for making these projects
186:49 - students like me need you please don't
186:51 - stop
186:52 - keep going let's keep going bro let's
186:55 - keep going
186:55 - amazing nice so e dot prevent default
186:59 - stops to refresh
187:00 - right it stops to refresh which in react
187:02 - we hate right
187:04 - but how do we post in the database so
187:06 - this is actually going to be
187:07 - surprisingly a lot easier than you think
187:10 - right so what the way we do that is
187:12 - essentially
187:13 - all we need to do is go ahead and write
187:15 - the following so we say
187:17 - db so we need to import the db so i'm
187:20 - going to go ahead and import that first
187:21 - so i'm going to say import db from my
187:23 - local firebase
187:25 - so boom boom boom local firebase not the
187:28 - module
187:29 - local firebase and i'm gonna say db dot
187:32 - collection
187:34 - posts right i'm gonna say dot add
187:38 - right say dot add and then basically
187:40 - this is all you need you add an object
187:42 - and that object has the same
187:44 - shape that we did earlier so remember
187:46 - when we basically went ahead and we
187:47 - added
187:49 - um the object kazi basically did it
187:51 - inside the firebase
187:52 - interface right he went in and added
187:54 - display name username so when
187:55 - we do the same thing here we say display
187:57 - name equals
187:59 - in this case the display name we're
188:00 - going to hard code it to be raphe kazi
188:02 - right well let's go ahead and say yeah
188:04 - let's do rafflecard rafikaze says to
188:05 - rafee
188:06 - qazi nice and then we're going to say
188:09 - the
188:09 - username is going to be um
188:16 - there we go we can even open this up
188:18 - right here if you want to look at it
188:20 - yeah yeah so this is exactly essentially
188:23 - what we're doing right now
188:24 - right but programmatically and then
188:26 - we're going to say verify this
188:27 - we're going to assume that it's true so
188:28 - verify it is true
188:31 - right and then we're going to say the
188:32 - text in this case is
188:34 - not going to be like a hard code value
188:36 - it's going to be whatever we wrote
188:37 - inside the tweet message
188:38 - right which we mapped when we did the
188:40 - input field right
188:41 - whoa we just hit 1.5 k likes nice
188:45 - thank you guys yeah just broke 1500
188:48 - likes right this second and uh also 22

190:01 - go through it the code's going to be a
190:03 - github link amir says
190:04 - people might think we're paid to say
190:06 - that these sessions are the best but
190:08 - that's not true
190:09 - consider the amount of knowledge you
190:11 - gain from these videos and it's all for
190:13 - free these guys are killing it
190:15 - thank you brother yeah we're going to
190:17 - keep going thank you very much
190:18 - nice so we added the text which came
190:21 - from the tweet message
190:22 - steve says what about a slack clone oh
190:25 - that's actually oh yeah you know a
190:27 - cyclone will be fun dude
190:28 - i'm done you could even learn electron
190:30 - electron js
190:32 - oh yeah that would be dope
190:38 - oh
190:41 - yeah oh yeah yeah maybe we'll do it one
190:44 - day
190:46 - yeah so for now we're going to use that
190:48 - clever programmer logo as the avatar so
190:50 - that's going to be hard-coded still
190:52 - we're going to keep that one as a
190:53 - hardcoded value
190:54 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this and
190:56 - then
190:57 - for the image right we're going to go
191:00 - ahead and use
191:01 - the tree image so if we left it blank
191:03 - it's going to be blank that's fine
191:04 - but if we didn't then it's going to go
191:06 - ahead and use this which is the tree
191:08 - image right
191:08 - so that's cool and now what will happen
191:12 - is and basically after you tend to send
191:14 - a tweet
191:15 - you actually want to erase the tweet the
191:17 - sending the tweet message box and the
191:19 - tweet image right you don't want to
191:20 - actually show
191:21 - like anything the sort of previous
191:23 - contents you had in that input file so
191:25 - i'm going to go ahead and do set
191:26 - tweet image and set tweet message to
191:29 - blank after that
191:31 - if you don't do that the image the input
191:32 - files aren't going to reset right
191:34 - nice so if i go ahead and click save
191:38 - now so click save like that now
191:41 - what we should see is uh because if we
191:44 - go ahead
191:45 - and type in what's happening so like
191:48 - let's go ahead and type something into
191:49 - what's happening so let's go this is a
191:50 - real test or something
191:51 - this is a no i'm going to say

192:31 - i kept it like that i apologize you guys
192:34 - okay cool so this should be good

192:42 - we did that oh right now it wasn't
192:44 - sharing extra screen okay so yeah
192:46 - so guys what we're doing here is what we
192:47 - did just to run through again we did dv
192:49 - dot collection post
192:50 - ad and then we're mapping to the objects
192:53 - and the ones to take note of here are
192:55 - tweet message and tweet image
192:56 - which are being mapped to the state
192:58 - which is our input fields
193:00 - and then we basically reset the fields
193:01 - to to sort of clear them
193:03 - right all right all right what if we
193:06 - just did that to just get the chat going
193:08 - um okay cool so this is good um i got

196:24 - right so like guys you can see here
196:28 - like you're literally getting a case of
196:30 - um
196:31 - it's pretty much uh it's the reason why
196:34 - it's shuffled if
196:34 - if any of you guys are wondering by the
196:36 - way it's because we haven't put in
196:37 - timestamps random zbr says yo boys i
196:40 - need to go right now i have a meeting i
196:41 - have followed along with most of the
196:43 - streams believe me this is

196:52 - you dude
196:53 - all right so we're going to give you
196:55 - guys two more treats quickly
196:56 - right one of them was we talked about
196:59 - react flip move
197:00 - so i'm going to go ahead and quickly and
197:01 - show you how to implement that and get a
197:03 - smooth list
197:04 - right so we're going to implement that
197:05 - and then we're going to deploy the app
197:06 - right
197:07 - so stick with us guys and we're going to
197:09 - be pretty much done very shortly
197:11 - right yeah so react flip move to install
197:14 - it is mpmi
197:16 - react flip move so we're going to go
197:17 - ahead and pull up the terminal
197:19 - and do so kazi is chuck in the terminal
197:22 - uh chuck it in the terminal here we go
197:26 - mpm i and then react flip move so that's
197:30 - right frank if you are having trouble
197:32 - joining slack don't worry just shoot me
197:33 - a text i'll help you out
197:36 - all right npm what flip move oh no i
197:40 - i had it in there the nvmi uh flip move
197:42 - react flip move that one there
197:44 - got it dope we installed that go check
197:46 - this out basically what i was doing for
197:48 - uh
197:49 - to get me going on coding uh facebook
197:52 - popped this
197:52 - up from a few years ago so i don't
197:55 - recommend this you guys
197:56 - but um this is you know
197:59 - i had to this is me ordering ton of red
198:02 - bulls
198:04 - i don't know bulletproof coffee and and
198:06 - just
198:07 - a crap ton of lucky jack like ex
198:10 - yeah black coffee and it's like triple
198:13 - shot or something like that
198:14 - so you know i was gonna try that
198:16 - actually the bulletproof coffee
198:18 - i never tried that that's how i used to
198:20 - freaking code you guys
198:22 - but you know not anymore now i'm on a
198:23 - good sleeping schedule
198:28 - i love that the greatest ever says sunny
198:30 - starts laughing at the memes before
198:32 - qazi uploads them just like me kazzy's
198:35 - crazy
198:37 - let's go bro no
198:41 - he said we can't see the code editor
198:44 - again
198:44 - i did it again
198:49 - what's wrong with me i'm so sorry damn
198:53 - all right guys all right all right all
198:54 - right all right i'll get better at it
198:56 - don't worry
198:56 - don't worry i got you i got you all
198:58 - right let's keep going right so all we
198:59 - did there guys was mpmi
199:01 - react flip move so we did this mpmi
199:03 - react flip move
199:04 - and we hit enter and that was it right
199:07 - so in order to basically
199:08 - let's go ahead and add um the react flip
199:11 - move
199:11 - so to do it i'm not going to explain too
199:14 - much of the implementation i'll let you
199:16 - guys go ahead and check out the
199:17 - documentation i'm just going to show you
199:18 - how you can pretty much chuck it inside
199:20 - of this so
199:22 - we want it basically on every post so we
199:24 - want all the posts to be animated right
199:26 - so in order to do that what we need is
199:28 - we need to go to the post itself
199:30 - i'm going to change this to a functional
199:31 - com uh to not not a functional one an
199:33 - es6 function
199:35 - so it's like this right and then what
199:37 - i'm going to go ahead and do i don't
199:38 - know why that's freaking out that's not
199:40 - wrong
199:40 - um let's go ahead and do this yeah and
199:42 - then what i need to do is import
199:44 - forward ref so forward ref is a way of
199:46 - handling references in react
199:48 - so again don't really need to know
199:51 - exactly what that is at this point if
199:53 - you want to
199:54 - go ahead and check out the react docs
199:56 - but how do we use it right
199:58 - we basically go here before the the
200:01 - props
200:01 - and we basically do the following right
200:03 - we write forward ref
200:05 - put another parenthesis so another
200:07 - bracket go all the way down to the
200:09 - bottom
200:09 - what is this for what are we doing
200:12 - what's the point of this
200:14 - we're setting up react flip move oh i
200:17 - see okay
200:18 - do people know what react flip move is i
200:20 - don't think so right so before
200:22 - so yeah so we showed the other uh the
200:24 - sort of slide at the beginning but it
200:25 - might be worth showing them yeah so if
200:27 - we go ahead and open this react flip
200:29 - oh yeah i got you here we go guys here's
200:33 - react flip move
200:36 - boom and voila here we go
200:39 - hey so this is what we're gonna what
200:42 - we're building right now
200:44 - yep so it gives you like a very nice
200:46 - smooth animation right
200:47 - yeah um awesome so with that said
200:51 - now what we're gonna do is we're
200:52 - basically gonna do we put the forward
200:54 - reference so we've done it there
200:56 - added the parentheses here and then all
200:58 - the way at the bottom down here
201:00 - to sort of close everything off so
201:02 - that's nice and now what i'm going to do
201:05 - is go ahead and do the following so i'm
201:08 - going to go ahead and say
201:10 - this actually what we need to do is
201:12 - where we have our
201:14 - props over here need to add print
201:17 - parentheses here and i need to go ahead
201:21 - and do
201:21 - this jj asks do you have any plans to
201:24 - use typescript would react in any future
201:26 - tutorials i think the answer to that is
201:28 - hell yeah right
201:30 - yeah definitely yeah guys we're all i
201:33 - actually code
201:34 - yeah you code and typescript right
201:37 - yeah yeah all about that hype script
201:40 - life you guys
201:41 - so we're going to be doing a lot of that
201:42 - soon exactly
201:45 - so guys uh we pretty much here were the
201:47 - props
201:48 - and what i did is i added this this
201:50 - second parameter when we added forward
201:52 - ref because we gives us something called
201:53 - a ref
201:54 - right and all we need to do here is go
201:56 - ahead and do this we say ref
201:58 - equals that ref right that's it right
202:01 - that's for the first part that's the
202:02 - first part we need to do right
202:04 - and then what we do so that's for the
202:05 - post the individual posts right
202:07 - now where we actually animate the posts
202:10 - so where we have multiple posts being
202:12 - shown on the screen is inside of the
202:14 - feed
202:14 - right it's inside the feed and the way
202:16 - we do it now in here is we basically go
202:18 - ahead and import flip
202:20 - move from a react flip move at the top
202:22 - like this
202:23 - and then what we need to do is basically
202:26 - wrap
202:27 - the the mapping inside of the
202:30 - that flip move so we need to go ahead
202:32 - and do the following so this so now you
202:34 - can see
202:34 - that we've essentially wrapped our posts
202:37 - inside of
202:38 - flip move but in order to get this to
202:40 - work correctly we need to give it a key
202:42 - right now a key in this case has to be
202:44 - something unique
202:46 - in this case the key that we're going to
202:47 - use isn't the best key to use but it
202:49 - will work for this case
202:50 - we're going to say the key is the post
202:52 - text right because in this case we
202:53 - haven't got any text with the same
202:55 - thing but in this case what you should
202:56 - be doing is pulling the document id
202:59 - from firebase and using that as your key
203:01 - but in this case
203:02 - to save time we're basically just going
203:04 - to use the post text as your id
203:06 - and then what i'm going to go ahead and
203:08 - do is save and now kazi if you
203:10 - actually let me go and save this
203:14 - so if you go ahead and open up localhost
203:16 - and maybe refresh it
203:18 - okay yeah give me one second i'm gonna
203:21 - just go ahead
203:22 - and uh do that
203:25 - right here and uh open this up and
203:28 - refresh it
203:34 - all right what are we looking for if you
203:36 - type in
203:37 - like add a post now whoops
203:41 - test
203:48 - clean boy let me check on my local
203:51 - hostess out because i couldn't see it
203:53 - properly
203:53 - but that looks like it's adding it in
203:55 - random places you know so
203:56 - we won't sometimes see that's because of
203:58 - the timestamp yeah
204:02 - i'm going to do it for my machine guys
204:04 - i'm going to say hey
204:06 - there i saw from your machine
204:09 - yeah i saw sunny in the house
204:12 - damn nice
204:16 - awesome right
204:19 - so with that said guys we pretty much
204:21 - showed you how to add a animation
204:23 - library which is so dope
204:24 - and it works really really nice and
204:26 - clean um
204:28 - awesome so yeah so that pretty much has
204:30 - an animation make sure when you are
204:32 - using a key guys
204:33 - use the firebase doc.id which will you
204:36 - get at this point just to show you guys
204:38 - uh because i don't want to sort of
204:40 - mislead anyone with it with the key
204:41 - information so here
204:43 - what you would do is when you have
204:44 - doctor data you can pretty much at this
204:47 - point pull out
204:47 - doctor id as well right so you can do
204:50 - something like doctor id and that's the
204:52 - that's the key that you want to use
204:55 - which gives you a unique id from
204:57 - firebase so in case you're wondering
204:58 - that's the one that you're going to use
205:00 - um awesome
205:02 - so i think with that said qazi we're
205:05 - ready to actually go ahead and deploy
205:08 - so guys if you're excited let us know in
205:10 - the comments uh we're going to show you
205:11 - right now
205:12 - how to go ahead and deploy this app
205:17 - we're going to be deploying this [ __ ]

206:44 - yeah um all right all right time to
206:47 - deploy
206:48 - yeah let's do it so inside the terminal
206:51 - guys is where we did so we don't
206:53 - actually need to do anything on firebase
206:55 - yeah yeah i forget that sometimes you
206:57 - know
206:58 - but okay so guys it's pretty simple
207:00 - we're gonna do firebase in it right
207:03 - yep and then um we're just gonna sit
207:05 - here and wait and then we're gonna look
207:07 - over here pretty soon it's gonna ask us
207:09 - some questions in a second
207:10 - let's go down to hosting you guys
207:12 - because we don't need to do any other
207:14 - stuff right
207:15 - hit hosting we're going to hit use an
207:17 - existing project and then boom we're
207:19 - going to go
207:19 - to this is our what clone twitter clone
207:23 - so let's find twitter clone boom so
207:26 - let's click that
207:27 - now for this make sure you guys say
207:29 - build because that's a folder
207:31 - things go into so for those of you guys
207:33 - who might have trouble
207:34 - seeing right now uh i'm gonna just write
207:37 - it out on the screen
207:38 - so just write build here that's it i'm
207:41 - going to hit enter
207:43 - it's a single page application so say
207:45 - yes don't say
207:46 - no type in y and hit enter so now this
207:50 - build
207:50 - folder should be made for you guys and
207:53 - that's looking good so sunny at this
207:56 - point
207:57 - what do we do with that do we do
207:58 - firebase uh do we do npm yeah
208:01 - build yeah so we do npm and also guys
208:05 - before you do that
208:06 - when you did firebase and net you might
208:08 - be prompted to log in
208:09 - all you need to do is do firebase login
208:10 - if that happens and then it'll pop up on
208:12 - chrome
208:13 - all right so that's just in case anyone
208:15 - runs into that
208:16 - um but yeah now we need to do npm run
208:18 - build and what this will do is
208:20 - so let's go ahead and run that command
208:22 - um qazi i love that
208:24 - uh as soon as i said that frankie
208:26 - dropped in the chat and he's like are
208:28 - you guys pumped
208:29 - when we were talking about the gnostic
208:31 - npm run build right
208:33 - yeah mpm all right and what this does
208:37 - guys is it strips out all the developer
208:39 - rubbish pretty much gets everything
208:41 - super optimal right so it basically
208:43 - creates like a
208:44 - super lightweight build of the app
208:47 - everything that's gonna be online
208:48 - is in this folder okay this is what's
208:51 - gonna be actually online
208:54 - yeah important point here guys if you
208:56 - make any changes after you do npm run
208:59 - build
208:59 - you have to do npm rom build again to
209:02 - get the latest build

214:16 - material ui was used for all the icons
214:19 - all right real time firestore database
214:21 - was used for the comments and the post
214:23 - that we made
214:25 - you guys learned how to use css
214:27 - variables and
214:28 - suddenly you use them for twitter color
214:30 - right yeah we use it for the twitter
214:32 - color and also
214:33 - a background color so css variables are
214:35 - used yeah
214:36 - and then to add those nice slick
214:38 - animations you guys use
214:40 - react flip move and this is what created
214:42 - those dynamic animations when you're
214:44 - posting the tweets
214:45 - so so so juicy and so nice
214:49 - and then at the end what did we do sonny

217:47 - you're going to get weekly trainings
217:49 - you're going to learn how to make an
217:51 - income with javascript which i think is
217:53 - huge
217:54 - and one of the best things with it that
217:57 - i want to show
217:58 - you guys actually is the fact that you
218:00 - actually get
218:01 - an amazing community of people that
218:04 - come with it so you know here is
218:07 - actually sudjan right here who actually
218:09 - joined and he just landed a 2 000
218:11 - a month client and here is the rest of
218:14 - the community and we have over
218:16 - 1400 amazing members
218:19 - that are a part of this so yeah
218:22 - sergeant just dropped a really crazy
218:24 - comment i said this one client
218:26 - guys returned everything he paid for in
218:28 - pwj so worth
218:29 - every single penny oh damn where did you
218:32 - drop that
218:34 - he dropped that on a comment just now
218:38 - oh i see that is awesome let me actually
218:41 - share that because that's super dope
218:43 - so yep he's like this one client
218:45 - returned everything i paid so yeah guys
218:47 - i mean
218:48 - if you're getting work as a developer i
218:51 - mean whatever you pay for this program
218:52 - is going to be pennies
218:54 - you know oftentimes what people do is
218:56 - there's a saying
218:58 - tripping over dollars to pick up pennies
219:02 - and that's what people often do so
219:03 - they're like hey i don't want to join
219:04 - this program
219:06 - or some other program because it's too
219:08 - much money that i have to invest
219:10 - but then they keep trying to like
219:12 - through failure trial and error figure
219:14 - out their own way and that costs you
219:16 - something you can't ever get back that
219:17 - costs you time
219:19 - time is the most expensive price you can
219:21 - pay and they say that
219:24 - broke people are cheap with their money
219:27 - and rich people are actually cheap with
219:29 - their time
219:30 - so instead of being cheap with your
219:32 - money i think it's a lot better if
219:34 - you're cheap with your time
219:35 - meaning invest money up front so you
219:37 - don't have to make those mistakes and
219:38 - you can learn
219:39 - like sudjan get those clients exactly
219:43 - you heard it guys you saw it firsthand
219:46 - proof that somebody's actually made a
219:48 - huge amount
219:48 - more than they even paid for the course
219:50 - like definitely go and check it out
219:52 - yeah jen last week that we shared with
219:54 - you guys got a job offer for 96
219:57 - 000 a year so she's also part of this
220:00 - community
220:01 - right here and guys interesting story
220:04 - with jen
220:05 - she lost her job due to coved right so
220:08 - she actually lost her job
220:09 - and then she about i think it was like a
220:11 - week or two later
220:12 - landed a job which paid double her
220:15 - salary

stuff that we're going to go through we're going to be using material ui so material ui is going to be used to cover all of the icons all of the designs getting everything looking that really nice slick uh sort of final getting that final design in place we're gonna be doing that we're gonna be showing you how to actually go ahead and get the design that they have inside of twitter so if you go ahead and go to the twitter website for a sec um just i just want to show you one thing on the twitter site so you'll notice that the the sidebar and the right so the left and the right part don't move but the middle scrolls ah yep they don't move yeah so we're gonna show you guys how to go ahead and build that and we're also gonna be showing you guys i know a lot of you guys go crazy when we introduce firebase so we're gonna do that we're gonna introduce some firebase into this and we are gonna go ahead and go ahead and make it so that when you write a message or tweet and you post it

material ui is gonna be used for all these icons that you guys are seeing on the left hand side for maybe even all these icons right over here and that's going to be material ui next up we're going to be using firestore so this is the firebase database so it's a realtime database and we can use it to even store things like comments so we'll show you guys how we're going to be using it uh in this project and we're going to talk a little bit about css variables in this one is that right sony yeah that's the first guys so this is the first time in one of these builds that we're going to introduce css variables so really exciting stuff and they're so powerful even when i was building today to the app today it actually does make everything so much simpler so we're going to go ahead and show you guys how to use css variables yup and if you just join right now don't worry to miss anything yet we haven't even gotten started to build we're just walking through what we're going to be covering we're going to cover animation so one library we're going to be using is the react flip move super slick you guys can see how nice it looks over here i mean wouldn't you want your app to look like this and feel like this and this provides so this is going to provide animations when we're posting tweets and it's going to give a overall really dynamic feel to the site exactly really really slick animation library guys and adds that finishing little touch whenever you're sort of building any app and that's really impressive when you show that to people when they see that animations kind of moving around so my torah says the kings of web dev tutorials strike again looking forward to another amazing build let's go let's do it now if we go over here now we're going to be using firebase to actually deploy it online meaning you can send this link out to your friend to your mom to your dad to your grandpa doesn't matter anybody and everybody will be able to go to your.com and use it so that's the thing we're going to be using firebase for exactly the greatest ever says i think this will this is going to be the best build yet this one will 100 percent be insane hey nice and we will be sharing the code with you guys in case you're wondering we'll we drop a github link in the description and you guys will be able to go ahead and check out the code once we're done yep so now we're gonna drop the yeah exactly we're gonna put the link for you guys for the entire repo but again just a quick snapshot at a glance these are all the technologies you're going to be learning and even more we're going to be using firebase for a database and hosting there's going to be a lot of design stuff and of course you're going to learn react in this twitter clone that we're going to be building and this is what you're going to build with that said i hope you guys are excited i'm excited we just broke over 500 people live and guys if you are excited about this build what should they do sunny right now all we ask guys is that you go ahead and smash that thumbs up button so you can get this video out to as many people as possible that's all we ask guys hit that thumbs up button if you haven't already yeah that actually like uh roots in being super serious about this that really helps us out a lot we spend a lot of time making this we share that with you guys every day and we spend hours and hours building this out so when you guys smash that like button it just helps send it forward it shares it with more people and that's all we're really looking for so thank you guys so much and we just got a donation from romell and he actually left a message in spanish which i think frankie will be able to actually tell us but thank you so much for the donation also sahil chaudhary just says i got my first job because of you guys that's amazing dude whoa where where did that happen just slightly above the uh the donation oh wow that is freaking amazing oh i see it yep like on my first job because of you guys that is beautiful thank you so much all right awesome so thank you guys for the donation thank you guys for liking the video and helping us spread this message subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and just i think kind of one cool news i wanted to share with you guys which is actually huge for us so just a few days ago you guys i made um our official thousandth post on instagram so that was actually a really big deal and what's special about this post is you know we have a big news and it's official we just got our team cp mansion so it's a clever programmer mansion that we got it's crazy sonny yeah i'm excited dude and i'm flying down soon as well so we'll have the entire team in la it'll be exciting stuff so this is going to be amazing because i don't think in the software development world this has ever been done where you know how like uh gaming streamers get all of their like they'll get a mansion or a place and then they all lived and work from there and you guys will see this happen even with startups as they're growing they do that they get like a big place and then they all live in their work from there so finally we're going to be doing that in the clever programmer team and it's going to be absolutely insane and around september 3rd sunny will also be here in l.a and we will all be working together so i think exactly that's super exciting um you guys can see me here running with frankie because we have we discovered there's like this water slide which is so freaking sick and you know i just wanted to share this moment and thank you guys for giving us opportunity to do this but really the one of the biggest reasons why we even got this place is so we can relentlessly produce this content at the highest level for all of you guys you know nas is going to be there working with us every single day frankie's going to be there i'm going to be there putting in the work and hopefully sunny comes down from uk as well and we're just going to put that work for you guys and just crush it exactly 100 guys but we'll get together like if you guys are enjoying it right now imagine when we all get together that'll be insane yeah all right we're gonna blow this up that would be really crazy so super excited about that thank you guys it's been a huge deal for us now living fate gave another donation he says would you ever do flutter tutorials i'm actually talking to somebody about flutter so let's talk about that and um i'm also it's just like a boot camp for esports team yeah we're also thinking about hosting events for clever programmer there so we can actually help people in person and get jobs or learn skills and do boot camps that would be cool yeah awesome with that said i think sunny let's just get straight into the build let's do it so guys uh like we said we're going to be touching base on firebase and we're going to be building a dope twitter react app so with that said the first step guys is we actually need to go ahead and use create react app so i think i have access to the terminal uh or this might be my local uh you might need to share the terminal quasi yep i will do in a second i love this comment here i'm just gonna share it on the screen and uh nashant says can you actually see that comment sunny uh actually i am i'm sharing it with you right now you're in it i can even see your cursor in my terminal uh i can't see it no okay all right here we go cool i just sent the link again it's the same oh no no i'm inside i'm inside the uh the live show i mean the terminal oh okay my bad my bad got it got it got it got it okay so let's go here terminal and i'm gonna go right click make it read and write for you so you can have access to it but yeah i just love that nishant says you guys are awesome just completed your tinder clone i'm a seasoned react developer and still learning so many things from you let's roll love that that's amazing we definitely want to have more developers on this platform too yeah also just want to say guys we see every single one of the stories that you guys post and we literally we love it like it's so cool when we do these videos and you guys actually go ahead and rebuild them go ahead and share them with everyone so on instagram just tag me in kazi do the same thing keep that going because it really does motivate us keeps us going and it's just so nice to see when you guys get involved you guys here it is like literally you guys sharing this with us so this is one student sharing yesterday's stream with us logan federally say our also shared yesterday's stream um another person shared it what they were doing diego finished his covet 19 tracker i'm actually showing uh showing them my phone screen share right now sonny yeah i see him there so i could so that that's what happened v coder shared like one of the facts from developer knowledge so you guys can share all this stuff with us like eunice just shared he was up late night learning and then we repost this on our own instagram stories so you guys feel free to send us all of this we love to connect with all of you and then repost all of the things that you guys are actually sending us it's actually a lot of fun exactly we really love it guys i think so it allows us to have a chat with you as well so the amount of people that do jump on to sort of in the in the dms and we sort of go back and forth and i can help you guys fix problems if you're having them just guys if you do ping a question don't ask generic questions make it super direct because we get like hundreds of questions that come through so if the only way i can help is if you say like here's my problem and this is a screenshot of it then i can help you out otherwise super hard to help you guys out just want to make that sort of shout out while we're over here yep yep super helpful okay dope nice so what is what is now now that we're just diving into the actual code you guys some of the questions we're going to take on later and now we're just going to start with the build so where are we starting now sunny we're going to be doing the npx create app exactly so first step guys you want to open up a terminal and do mpx to create react app right so create react app and then you want to type in whatever the app you want to call it so in this case we're going to call it twitter dash clone you don't want to have spaces you want to do dashes instead guys so that will go ahead and actually create the entire starter template with the tool that facebook has given us create react app and basically this just gives you like a perfect starting place so yeah that would take about a few minutes to set up we need to go ahead and do what now cause so here is just a visual of what sunny just talked about and he actually posted this also on his instagram story or instagram post and this is how you can create your own react app so you guys can see it's just like a very simple threestep process and then you just have to do npm start to run it and then boom volume now you have actually created your own react app exactly so really simple guys and if you do forget the steps that we said like cause he said go over to my instagram i've got a post on there which actually shows you all the steps to get that up and running i love what the greatest ever just said he goes i want to thank you guys cuz he goes because lol i have never been in a position where i'm happily turning offers down because i know that what i have recently learned is insanely valuable the that's nice dude i love that that's huge yeah awesome so now it's installing you guys can see at the bottom and we're finishing installing this and then we're going to move into it and should we do the firebase thing right now sunny or do it later yeah let's go ahead and set up firebase right now okay cool help us out so boom let's just jump into and add the firebase okay so guys firebase is just a suite of tools by google and they pretty much allow us to do a bunch of things so in this case we're going to have a database today with firebase and we're also going to have the hosting uh managed by firebase you can you can do authentication you can do a bunch of stuff like that go ahead and check out the amazon clone if you want to check out the authentication side of things but today we're going to be using the database and the hosting so if you guys know if you guys know aws firebase is just aws but a lot easier and simpler yeah it's like the friendly aws yeah that's the simplest way to i think that should be their tagline the friendly aws that's it i think they will kill it exactly they just make it so you only have to do what you need to do like you don't have to any setup or configuration or any headache behind it all you need is a gmail account and you can pretty much get started yeah yeah in the glow says these sessions i have to admit these sessions really show why i love coding and learning to code various clones awesome nice awesome so so i'm opening this up now i'm going to create a add i'm going to add a project okay so make sure you guys do that and then in this project basically i'm going to name it so here guys i'm going to name this project because we're doing twitter clone i'm going to call it twitter clone yep i'm going to hit continue now you don't need to have analytics you can have it disabled or enabled i'm just going to enable it continue and then i'm going to connect it with some analytics account and create project yeah and this will go ahead and set up your project guys once this is done there's a few steps that we need to do to go ahead and grab a config file and now what this config is basically going to allow us to do is pretty much go ahead and connect the react app which is our front end to firebase which is going to act as our back end in this case so firebase is really nice because you don't have to do the traditional back end sort of headache and setup it just does everything super quick so now we could continue i love it js says thank you both of you i left my cab driver job to learn front end development with you you have changed my life oh my god love that's insane yeah that's amazing damn thank you really awesome right he says please share your instagram damn raja says i'm a software developer at ibm but still learned hooks and a lot of other stuff that i'm not able to do during my daily job just because of you guys damn developer at ibm that's huge so it's huge for some reason sunny i'm not showing at the bottom of the screen or i'm actually just not showing at all frankie camera died no no no it just died right now so let me actually fix this here real quick guys i saw apologize about that thank you for the donation and mutations is it a mutation nas thank you very much it's fine that's fine frankie i'm just going to use this let's go ahead cool all good all good i can answer a few questions oh and also thank you just because of you i could teach react to my teammates that's what we went ahead did we love that if you can teach it after watching our live streams then we've done a good job of teaching you like your amazing stuff there yeah really really awesome yeah oh man this it's still installing i don't know how long this thing is going to take is it doesn't take this long right yeah i know sometimes it's got a bit of a weird thing it could be like the internet because we're streaming with you guys but once it's up and running we'll get we'll get done pretty quick oh it's just shot through so it might be pretty quick i just saw a really good comment there goes you guys have been so right about hajira caitanya says you guys have been so right about pattern recognition it seems very familiar now best way to learn exactly we always talk about pattern recognition and this is basically where you keep repeating something until you notice the little patterns which kind of appear over and over again so for example by doing these live streams even if it seems like you're not taking in any information guys it will like you'll pick up you'll notice similarities and you can go ahead and check that here's the instagram you guys i'm touching it this is our instagram i'm literally oh it feels nice and soft it's like jelly oh look at that it's so good so just you know you can follow us there and uh boom there we go we are up and running now the most important thing that i always forget to do is cd into this bad boy right there we got another donation thank you so much thank you very much hey canadian 10 i think is that what it is right uh mine's a bit delayed courtney wilson he says the amount of knowledge you're sharing and helping people is awesome keep the positivity creativity and motivation you have in growing cp to endless possibilities let's go thank you so much courtney that's amazing thank you so much really appreciate it and by the way i want to just shout out to all actual developers who also have the ability to speak and have a passion for sharing hit me up on instagram uh hit sign me up on instagram too and we want to give you a voice on this platform so if you develop in flutter if you develop in java if you develop in c plus plus or you develop and react.js or whatever javascript we want to have you even come on and teach other people we want to make clever programmer the vision is to have clever programmer produce the most amount of developers on the planet than any other institution including schools exactly exactly that's our main mission guys to get as many developers up and running as we possibly can yep so thank you for that all right so now we're up and running and we've cd'ed into this so now sunny what we're gonna be doing is guys get into your twitter clone right over here and also just hit npm start and that should start your app and it should open up your localhost on the right hand side a few other things we're going to do because we kind of do them really really often so i'm just going to go ahead and do them a little bit faster now is we're going to delete some of the stuff we don't need so test app test logo and the setup test we don't need so exactly as soon as our local host starts running we're going to go ahead and delete that romel thank you for another donation really appreciate it yeah we could delete that right now actually it wouldn't break the uh the development so okay cool cool cool let's do it we're gonna go ahead and so there you guys see the at logo is spinning i just wanted them to see the spinning logo you know oh yeah we're gonna go ahead and delete that so now it'll complain because it doesn't know it doesn't know where the logo is anymore it's because we took it out so now we're just gonna go ahead and remove the logo we're gonna hit save and it's still gonna complain a little bit but we're gonna get rid of everything inside of this div okay so i'm gonna grab everything inside of this remove it and uh here instead of anything else we're just gonna replace it with this and we're gonna say hit clever programmers let's build a twitter clone of course i gotta have my rocket emojis hit save and boom it should be up and running there we go now you guys see how it's like centralized um now that's really cool but we want to take that design we want to take that away another thing you guys will see is that there's like this invisible 10 margin that's there in all react apps by default so we want to like get that get rid of that as well so now i'm going to go ahead and do a few things i'm going to go to our css file so we're going to go to app.css and um here i'm gonna just go ahead and remove everything now when i hit save you guys will see that this has you know left a line now and another thing i'm gonna do is it's going to be called we're going to follow the bem convention yeah and over here so following the bem convention this one is going to be lowercase app the class name so i'm going to hit save on that as well sunny go ahead you can take it over i feel like i feel like such a proud dad when you go through those don't let go and carry on nice awesome so with that said guys as once we've done that we've pretty much done the cleanup process and then you want to go over to index.css that's the last step um you just want to um whoa rad radwan just sent 20 us dollars he said i am on vacation this week i have to drop now guys please join kazi's program on a data science lead at a top bank but two to three hours a day you'll be ready within six months thank you that is amazing i still oh now i see it okay i'm going to share it on the screen because that's i think awesome so here it is uh radon just donated 20 thank you so much for that he says kazian team i'm on a vacation this week i have to drop now guys please join qazi's program and data science lead at top bank put two to three hours a day you will be ready within six months uh and he just joined our program profit with javascript so i'm pumped to have them and work with them there thank you so much thank you dude really appreciate that and we also just hit 700 viewers i think whoa are you serious yeah wow thank you guys that is awesome if you guys want us if you guys want the video to keep going out to more people and you're enjoying it just please hit that like button and it just keeps spreading it out to more and more people exactly right ready so yeah now you see that because you mentioned that 10 pixels sort of like or like little gap above the text right yeah to get rid of that we need to go into index.css index.css the scary place yeah no that's not the same that is this kind of scary place but the really scary place is the index.js i see yeah so now we've got the margin zero and as soon as we hit save guys you'll notice it should snap up right there we go so that's the entire cleanup process done so with that said we can actually go ahead and get started so we notice how in twitter they have pretty much three sections from the page right we have the sidebar we have the middle feed and then we have the sort of widgets on the right hand side so we can actually go ahead and show them this before we kind of jump in so if we look at the actual twitter website we'll see that you um you have a sidebar you have like the middle feed where you kind of scroll through and then you have that widgets on the right right so if we have a look now so you can see that sidebar on the left really clean and the only scrollable thing here guys is that middle feed so we're going to show you how to make it like that but this is the only scrollable thing here by the way exactly yeah keep going that's the that's the only scrollable thing and then we have the widgets on the right so what i like to do is i kind of like to sort of draft things out so let's go ahead and make that half the screen again or actually have a local host up on the right cool so boom right here there we go and what we're going to do now is we i like to use comments to sort of like mark out what we're going to do so the first three things that we're going to build or like the goal of what we're going to build is we're going to have three separate things one is going to be the sidebar that we saw just previously then we're going to have the feed so the feed is that middle uh feed with all the posts inside of it and then we have so just slow down here slow down here so i want to show you guys this okay so when he says sidebar i just want to make it clear like exactly what each of those components he's talking about so yeah uh this will never ex okay so here when you say feed it's this thing here below the top or is it the whole higher including the home yeah so we have components inside of it but we are we are actually calling this entire thing the feed so this thing is the feed so guys when we think react we think in component based terms so here this is going to be the feed okay just so it's extremely clear to you guys next up the thing that's going to be the sidebar is going to be this thing when it expands okay so we're going to be building this thing that when it expands it looks like this so this is going to be the sidebar okay yep and um then oh thank you the greatest ever just actually did another donation really appreciate that i'm gonna pop that up it's 140 czar and he says i may not have enough for the course right now because more than my monthly allowance and income but i really wanted to do this for you guys for a long time i cannot begin to thank you enough for what y'all are doing for me massively appreciate that dude we appreciate you so much thank you for being here for all these streams like we love all of you guys for being here and just contributing to the chat and like helping other developers out so thank you exactly thank you so much dude so going back to here right so you guys see the sidebar that we're going to be building and then the widgets where are the widgets so the widgets is that right section so you see where it says what's happening and then we all that stuff on the right and the search bar everything we're going to consider that as widgets cool right so it's like these extra sort of functionality so that side stuff is going to be this so this is how sunny will write out as comments like um components that he's going to be making exactly hopefully yeah and then within these components you can have other components inside of them and so forth until you have like this nice sort of finished product so with that said here's the rough layout so the first thing i think we could build is actually the sidebar because it's quite visually visual and it's easy to sort of see so let's go ahead and do that so i'm going to go ahead and create a file called sidebar.js so because if you want to build the first one and then after that we can go ahead and do it okay so i'm going to go right here to files and i'm going to hit boom new file and we're going to go sidebar dot js like that you guys and that's because it's a component components always have the first letter capital okay yeah exactly and then what we're going to use is we actually use something called es7 snippets which we use in all of our builds and it's an amazing extension which all of you guys should go ahead and install and what it allows us to do is write rfce and actually go ahead and press enter for some reason mine's not popping up right now oh no one's like rfce do i have to write this manually is it coming up for you quasi it's not coming up for me either weird huh extensions let me go to our extensions and it's installed so something weird is happening rfce okay so we might have to actually write this out so uh oh man that's a bummer i love this this is a side this is the sidebar js right yeah so the first thing you're going to have to do is import react from react so that's the first thing you do in any file so we can go ahead and do that so we say import react from react and then we're going to say function where are you where you're writing because i don't see it sidebar.js i'm in there but i didn't see that you wrote it i just wrote it in right now oh really yeah so maybe write some other stuff i want to see if we're out of sync or not yeah i think we're out of sync maybe because i just wrote function sidebar but it hasn't popped in yep don't see it right oh something yeah now i see you're writing weird okay yeah that's really gonna let's go ahead and check so function sidebar what about now okay we're good all right i think we're good cool cool for it yeah so function sidebar and then what this will do is it will return some uh jsx right so return some stuff inside of here and then we need to do x4 default and we're going to say export default sidebar right so that's going to allow us to actually use that outside of the sidebar then we're going to have a div inside of it and this is going to have the class name of sidebar so i'm going to go ahead and do that there we go and then inside of here guys we had that sidebar so let's go ahead and just draft out some of the things that we saw so we had at the top of it we had something like a twitter icon so we had a twitter icon at the top and then we had a few other things so we had a bunch of options right we had like the home button the explore button the notifications the messages bookmarks list profile all those sort of options on the side and what i'm going to do here is actually go ahead and create something like this so it's going to be a sidebar option component and then we're just gonna repeat it so we're gonna have several of them right and then at the end of it we had a buttons which said tweet so we had a button which was pretty much just had tweet on it right and that was styled in the way that we expected it to be and then what we're going to do is anytime we create a component i'm going to go ahead and do import and i'm going to import the appropriate css file so in this case import sidebar dot css i'm going to go ahead and create that file so sidebar dot css and i'm going to basically click enter and we should be in that file in just a second so now you should see yes there we go awesome so that's pretty much the uh the sidebar roughly set up to a degree so what we're going to do now is actually go ahead and code what we need to code so the first thing guys is that twitter icon the twitter icon that we see how can we actually get those icons quite simply and what we're going to be using today is material ui so what we need to do is we need to go ahead and install that into the project so posie let's run through the installation of material ui and material ui icons say that again again so now we need to install material ui ui icon yeah and what this will allow us to do guys so material ui is like a design library right it allows us to have loads of these beautiful components but as well it gives us these icon sets so you get pretty much get all the icons you even get the twitter icon uh you get nice really nice buttons you get which which have that nice ripple effect when you press it all those things come included with material ui so we're going to go ahead and uh yeah make sure you'll see this is how you guys are gonna install this by the way you guys so make sure you do material ui core this is installation and if you're using not react then this is how you're gonna install it but because we are using react this is our install now once we're inside of here make sure you guys go to icons because we're going to be using material ui for the icons okay so that twitter icon that other home icon the explorer one so i'll show you guys for example another important thing is once you're on material icons here um make sure to click where it says search the full list of these icons okay click that get inside of here and now it's going to give you the overall all the icons that are available at your disposal yeah once you're in here give it a second to pop up jesse joseph says kazi i'm so thankful for all you have been doing on your channel with your channel i've been able to completely transform my life thanks a lot once again dude that is sick thank you man thank you and the greatest ever just said this right here was such a lifesaver as well i've seen a few comments like that we're really glad that we can provide you guys with value that changes your life in that sense so amazing to see well what is the hashtag one called dude why isn't it coming up when i type in hashtag yeah they don't even have a hashtag one which kind of blew my mind uh we had to use something we had to use the search icon for that one instead but let's go ahead and type maybe type in like a home okay cool yeah so let's say i don't know so i couldn't find yeah so boom we got home right here right this is how you're going to be able to look up all your icons now once you're like hey i want to cop this i'm going to use this in my app click it boom here's your code and then you can use this and just pop it into your own app okay so it's as easy as that so that's how you're going to use material ui and make sure you also install the icons you guys so that's another important step so what you can do is copy this this is the one you need okay and now i'm going to have our command line here and basically what you want to do is npm i and then just paste it you remember guys you don't need to use dash dash save anymore ever again it automatically saves it so this is a weird thing that most people don't know about but that blew my mind when you told me that yeah most people didn't know about this i learned it and i was like yo son did you know this he's like what yeah i had no idea dude i don't think that's that same for years yeah i mean i didn't know about npmi yeah i was like how many shortcuts are these guys going to make what's going to be next ni yeah exactly i think all my zsh yeah so there you guys go this is how you can install so now you want to use those icons it's just as simple as that like little import at the top and then you're good to go with the icons okay awesome nice so with that said guys the way we use it now because we just installed all the dependencies we go ahead and we go to the import on line three and we can pretty much go ahead and pop it in there we say import twitter icon from material ui icons twitter hold up hold up we can't see you wait where were you writing oh i see it nevermind yeah we're good yeah so we pretty much go ahead and do import twitter icon from material ui icons for slash twitter and basically in order to use it it's very simple you pretty much go here you do twitter icon and then you pretty much just do four slash right and as soon as we hit save on that we actually need to actually pull this in so right now yes we have we are using the twitter icon but we don't render the sidebar anywhere so i need to go ahead and go to app.js and where we had the sidebar comment and you can see the comments actually really help you out because they sort of give you like an outline right let me go ahead and save this and then it says sidebar is not defined so in at the top we need to say import sidebar from sidebar yep and then i'm going to click save and now what we should see is it should do a hot reload and on the right it should be popping up so if we click save cyber is not defined yep i think it's just boom nice nice so that little icon is actually coming from the sidebar component because the components being rendered out and it's giving us a tour icon which is really nice so after the twitter icon it's the home icon right yeah so we have a bunch of this is where component based design comes in right we have a bunch of like options which all look the same right they all look the same they all have the same sort of hovering over functionality so rather than writing the same code all like over here when you say they all have hovering over functionality let's just visualize that so this is what he means by it guys you see how when i hover over it it turns blue so that's what we're talking about okay keep going yeah exactly that so that's um that's what we mean when we say that so in order to get that working guys what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and create sidebar option components so i'm going to create a file called cyberoption.js and we should be popping into that file and now and you can see we're inside there now i'm going to do rfce and hopefully before you make this let me just clarify a few things okay so first thing is this thing that you're making right now this is going to be when you say sidebar options what do you mean by that right so can you uh if you open up the twitter app you'll be able to see on the sidebar so let's go ahead and make it a little bigger you should be able to see on that sidebar you've got home with an icon you've got explore with an icon notifications with nikon messages and each one guys is the exact same in terms of design the only difference here is the icon and the text but everything renders out the same right even the way we hover over it has the same effect when we do that so what we're going to do is we're going to create one component called sidebar option and then we're going to customize it with props got it and that thing is gonna do what that thing is gonna do so if i have sidebar let me just write sidebar options here and functionality wise what that's gonna add is that on hover on hover turn blue yep so turn blue will give it a nice little background color and it's going to be more of a sort of in this in this demo it's going to be just purely sort of a ui component so it's just going to be something which looks nice on the side but we're going to show you how to handle it and style it and do everything to get it looking like you see it right there got it so is it going to be using also like flexbox to add in the spacing between the icon and the text as well um yeah so actually when we when we stack up here we don't use flexbox but you see where we've got the sidebar we've got the feed and the widgets there's plenty of flexbox to get that to be achieved and is that going to be inside of sidebar options or no uh in sidebar options we we do need to actually add a flex rule but we'll cover that when we get to that bit yeah okay got it cool so sidebar options wise i mean overall it's just hovered on hover it's going to turn blue and any other functionality that i can i should list out here yeah so we're going to show you how to actually pass a component as a prop so we're used to passing things like text through props or numbers and things like that but here we're going to show you actually how you can pass an entire component as a prop as well so a lot of people didn't know you could do that i'm going to show you how to do that today okay dope yeah and that component guys that we're going to be passing through is the icon itself right so that's how we have different icons got it so right now we're going to work on the sidebar options yep so it's going to be the sidebar options okay exactly cool nice so with that said guys let's go and hop into the sidebar options right so sidebar option is going to have a class name so let's go ahead and show the code editor there we go awesome so we have div and we have a class name and here we have class name i'm going to go ahead and do sidebar option like this right because we're using the bem naming convention and inside of here what we're going to do is we like for now just to get everything sort of tested and see if it's working let's go ahead and just pass in like this is an option right just to sort of see if it's working uh so i'm going to go ahead and click save and before we do that i'm going to go ahead and create the css file for this so i'm going to say import i'm going to say sidebar option.css like this and i'm going to go ahead and create that file and say sidebar option.css awesome there we go and now guys we have this is an option and then in order to use this now so just as an example i'm going to pull it in here so here we have all of our comments the sidebar option but i'm going to go ahead and do sidebar option like this but we need to import it so i'm going to go ahead and do this i'm going to say import sidebar option from cyber option option yep like that and that will go ahead and pull it in and now if i duplicate this like four times for example and save it we should see now on the right side we should say i am an option i am an option i am not so this is an option four times perfect yep yep right so the next step is all about sort of how do we address passing through props so here so i see what you're saying with the props so basically like you can actually pass it in a prop like you can pass it in uh pass it an icon yeah so you guys exactly like how for your functions right for those of you guys who are not that familiar with react when you guys have your own functions you guys have to pass in arguments for those functions like if you have a function that adds up two numbers you need number one and number two in this case when you're doing building components in this sidebar option you can actually pass it literally an icon as an argument in the function it's kind of like that and then it'll you know show that icon you could also pass it styling and then it can actually use that styling which is kind of really it's it's a functional way of front end yeah that's a really fun thing to do exactly guys and then uh so we're gonna pass it icons and we're also gonna pass it uh text exactly and we pass it through with the prop so what we can do here is use es6 and basically break apart the object at this point and say we're going to go ahead and receive some text right so that's cause you mentioned that's one of the props and then we're going to have an icon right but remember guys if we're passing in an icon which is a component in react we need every single component has a capital letter right so we have to use a capital i right so in this case because icon will be a component we have to pass in with a capital i so in order to render that component once we pass it in so to use the text that we passed through i can go ahead and go here and i can use these curly brackets which actually allows us do you like my uh do you like my text on that those squiggly structuring don't get intimidated by those guys exactly nice so in order to actually use that properly we add the curly braces uh the squiggly brackets and then we add text all right and that will go ahead and pull that variable into our html right there so that's jsx right there and then we'll show the icon in a second but i just want to demonstrate this bit first so inside of sidebar now we can go ahead and do this we can say text equals in this case we could do text equals let's say home so text equals home uh and then the next one we could do text equals explore for example and then oops explore and then the next one we can say text equals notifications right awesome and then we can just show free for now so like this have three and if i save it here you can see it passed through we've got home explorer notifications so that's really nice right now we have different icons for these things right so let's go ahead and we can pass in an icon and the icon that we're going to use for the home is actually something called home icon so i'm going to go ahead and import this and we found this from material ui through the method that we showed you earlier so i home icon all you need to do is pass that entire component through as a prop right and i'll show you how we use it in a second and the next one for the explore what we need to do is we go ahead and grab the search icon so here i do this so search icon so i go ahead and grab it from here and the next one after this is if we do icon equals let's go ahead and do this and we say icon equals the notifications none icon so it's a bit of a strange name but for this one i need to go ahead and grab this so notifications none icon there we go awesome and then what we need to do is we're passing in the icons now but are we actually rendering it so if we go ahead and look inside the component we're not rendering it so here i need to say icon yeah and you notice how it's green which means that it's a it's a component because it has a capital letter if i did lowercase see how it's blue that's because it's not a component right if we use a capital i it knows it's a component and it also is using the component that we pass through to dynamically generate that so as soon as i hit save now we'll see something really nice we should see all the icons pop in awesome so there they are they all come through guys which is really really nice um then what we're going to do is we need to go ahead and style it because right now that's not the prettiest thing uh that we want uh so we're gonna basically go ahead and firstly i'm gonna go ahead and add the rest of the sidebar options so i've got them all over here so i'm gonna go ahead and replace this with this so i need to do a bunch of imports here to get this so there's a few more imports i'm going to go ahead and grab so let's go ahead and do that there we go and as soon as i hit save and i saw a question which says hey sonny why do we store some functions in a variable type constant others not so guys that's pretty much an es6 uh es6 way of writing a function so you could write a function like this or you could do const oops or you could do const sidebar equals an arrow function like this this exact same thing you're pretty much wearing a function that this is a more declarative way of doing it for some people uh so it's pretty much down to preference so you just need to know that that is the same thing guys one thing one thing before we continue that i do want to mention is if you guys want to actually learn all of these skills right a lot of you are here because you want to learn these skills that's number one i imagine number two is you want to learn these skills for what do you want to just learn these skills for a hobby or do you want to actually learn these skills to then get a job to then freelance to then make an income for yourself or for your family so that thing of learning the skill and then turning it into cash actually practicality if that's something that's interesting to you and you actually want to do that we have something for you guys right over here we put together a completely free training for you guys it's top three mistakes to avoid when becoming a javascript developer but if you're interested in react this is still for you and this video we basically show you exactly how do you go from skills and then eventually turning that into cash and um i go down and i lay out the path from going from your zero dollars to making your first hundred thousand dollars from coding whether you do it over the span of six months one year three years five years it doesn't matter but this gives you that full roadmap so if you wanna see this value pack training it's pretty exclusive but we are offering it for free so click the button below and you can actually register for this training you can even open up a new tab right now and go and register for this and then come back to our current training yeah guys please go and do that right now because honestly this is like a hugely jampacked training where you're going to learn a bunch of stuff and it's completely free like i mean there's not many times that you can say there's just completely free content out there like this so go ahead and make sure you check out the description sign up to the webinar and then come back to the stream and just carry on simple yeah exactly so it's valuepacked super valuepacked and free all right guys let's get back to the training awesome so guys we just showed how we had the sidebar options that we pretty much went ahead and imported in and we can now see on the right hand side they all come in but they don't look great right they don't look like the finished product that we want so in this case what i'm going to go ahead and do is actually go ahead and style this so we did create a sidebar option.css file so i've gone ahead and given this a sidebar option class so before what we're going to do now is i'm going to go to sidebar option.css and i'm going to do the following i'm going to say 4 sidebar options so for that container i'm going to do display flex so display flex oops oh my rocket's firing off yeah display flex and then if i save that we should see everything will pop snap into the middle so it should snap really nicely into the middle there um there we go so it's all popped into the middle but the alignment you can't actually tell right now but the alignment's slightly off so we need to align item center and that will make sure that everything's vertically aligned perfectly so as soon as i do that you see the icons just came down a little bit right yeah really important to do that and then also we want it so that whenever you hover over them we want the cursor to change to a pointer right and the reason why we want to do that is because it's just a really nice user experience so let me so remove the pointer just so i can show this to all the people who are as dumb as me when it comes to front end so look guys ugh like when i'm over the bookmark and all this it's just weird right but if i go to actual twitter you see it turns into a pointer as soon as i hover over it and it's so simple to do that with css it's kind of crazy i mean with back end you have to program everything but here just do this now uncomment it real quick and watch what happens as soon as i'm hovering on it boom pointer pointer pointer exactly and the reason why that's so important guys is because as a user it then tells them that that's actually something they can click right without that it's very hard to know that thanks so much the yeah you were gonna just say that right thank you so much vishal for the donation really appreciate it and you guys we are at 9 600 views already it's not even been an hour yet so we're about to hit over 10 000 views thank you guys so much and if you're enjoying this right now and it's giving you value if you appreciate the hard work that sunny is putting here for you guys or the team that we put in the hard work for you guys just go ahead and give this video a thumbs up helps just take it so far out and share it with every single person so that's huge even something i wanted to show you guys here is right before this call right here's what we're doing and let me show you guys on my phone on instagram story so even right before this call right you guys can see we have to all these team meetings who actually put together all of this material for you guys and so if you guys want to appreciate that and share your appreciation with the entire team smash that like button subscribe to the channel and we're just going to keep on bringing the value for you guys yeah exactly guys like it's a huge team effort to be able to bring all of this uh value and content to you guys every single day so all we ask is again just smash the thumbs up button and that's literally job done that's all and we appreciate that massively guys because it just gets the video out to more people about 10 000 likes actually damn it's going up let's go all right let's keep going awesome so and now what we're going to do guys is we are going to have it so that we need to target those elements right so the material ui elements and now material ui actually goes ahead and adds a class of its own to those icons and what that class is is this one right here so it's material ui svg icon dash root and i found that through inspecting so what we're going to do is i'm basically saying inside of sidebar option if you find a child which is this so the icon go ahead and give it a padding of 20 pixels padding of 20 pixels and as soon as i hit save small little changes like this make all the difference guys so look as soon as i hit save now it's got immediate spacing right because it's got a really nice immediate spacing flexbox has allowed it to like uh just keep sort of central in their room hey we just hit 1 000 likes thank you guys so much exactly one zero zero zero really appreciate you guys amazing awesome love it all right so now guys what we're gonna do is we are actually gonna have uh we need to style that text a little bit so i'm going to say wherever we have a sidebar option which has a h2 tag underneath it so a direct child which is a h2 tag then i'm going to go ahead and say give it a font weight of 800 a font size of 20 pixels and a margin right of 20 pixels so if i go ahead and do this i'm going to save it and we should see the text will change it became a lot smaller right it had this nice sort of it tightened everything up really nicely yeah and now what we're going to do is i want it so that when i hover over it we get that nice hover effect right so in order to do that we say target the sidebar option container but add the hover property and now what we're going to say is whenever we hover over it this is one the background color that they use for that hover uh yeah when i hover over it now nothing is happening but it will soon be the one where when i hover over it it'll show me colors like that exactly okay so now if you hover over it go ahead and check that out you should see now that we should get over look at that that is slick boy and all of that is happening from that one line right here exactly damn what happening for that one love it and then what you notice is that like in twitter it's not like a flat square that kind of comes around it's got a border radius so it's like a nice little curvature to it so i'm going to go ahead and give that border radius of 30 pixels right then i'm going to basically say i want so now we want the text color to change right but we're going to be using the twitter blue throughout the app right so this is something new that we haven't done on a live stream before but basically we use the twitter blue throughout the entire app so rather than me remembering what the color for twitter blue is instead what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go to app.css and i'm going to go ahead and add our first global variable so i'm going to say these global variables apply anywhere inside the body and i'm going to say i'm going to go ahead and add a twitter so this is how you do it inside of css you say twitter color oops twitter color and the twitter color i have the hexadecimal color for it here so i'm going to go ahead and do this and now we have a variable called twitter color which basically resembles the color of twill so instead of remembering it i just go ahead and use this variable and i'm going to also do one for the background color of twitter which is here because we don't want to keep remembering this and i pulled this from the actual css variables are fancy now we can just use this whenever and then be good to go exactly and if i want to use the css variable in another css file like index.css how can i do that you have to import it no so there's like a kind of you it knows that because we're doing this we're applying this to the body scope so we're saying that these uh these variables exist within the entire body so right now well you can you can have it more granular but this is saying that these will exist throughout the entire body so in this case what i'm going to do is because i want them to be global right i want to be used usable for out so in this case what we can say is when we go to uh the hover over the cyber option i want the color of the text to be we say var to target the variable and i just say twitter color that's it and it will use the twitter color and that's super nice guys and what's powerful about this is that whenever we sort of do that and i kind of want to add a transition as well so before i carry on and add a little transition to say whenever the color changes give it 100 milliseconds and ease out of that transition and the reason why this is really useful guys and quite nice because if you go ahead and hover over it now check out what those small little changes did all right i'm pumped oh my god that is just so delicious i can [ __ ] eat this thing small little changes and the good thing with this guys is say for example twitter one day changed all of their color schemes that twitter was no longer blue it was green right as soon as they changed that variable right or the value of that variable where it wherever it's declared every single place where it's used will then have that new color so that's why it's really really powerful to go ahead and use css variables so if you haven't already yeah i have a so you don't need this color right anymore um background color no no that's a different one that's actually the difference so how come when i comment this out it still looks the same no so if you hover over it you see the color of the text doesn't change but if you if you add the twitter color back now so oh nice okay i see i see the difference now with that okay and then this transition makes go ahead yep steve mccarthy just said suddenly you can add a default after that for when another color in the variable isn't available i didn't know that thank you yeah i'll actually go ahead and play with that so i have i'm starting to dive a bit more into css variables so the more we kind of do these tutorials we can actually go ahead and mess around with those more nice here we are yep awesome so manish says i want to enroll to javascript program but for some reason payment page is throwing some error i can't complete the payment just send me a just send me or sonny a dm on our instagram right here and we will help you out we'll get on a call with you with that said right here transition guys if you take a look at it if i remove if i remove this transition comment it out look at that when i hover over it it looks good but it almost feels like there's something missing to make it give it that juicy feeling that like maybe you feel on twitter where it just is the slick slickness and um as soon as we add this transition in and add in that like 100 millisecond animation it just looks so nice that's awesome you guys could write it two ways you could write it as hundred milliseconds or i think 0.1 seconds as well should work yeah both the same oh yeah you can do it that way as well yeah yeah cool all right go for it awesome so you see guys very few tweaks there to make it look quite like super super slick right and now we've got a reusable component does everything we need it to do that's really really nice now what we're going to do next is we kind of want to have an active state right and the way we usually do this is we usually pass in a prop like this which is which is just active right and in this case what we're going to say is just the first one should have an active sort of uh variable whereas the other ones aren't going to be active and what we're going to do is we're going to target that and we're going to say if you're active and the way we do that we basically go ahead we add some jsx here we get rid of the normal quotes and we give back ticks because we want to do some string interpolation and here i'm going to say if you're active so if there's an active prop that has been passed through then go ahead and add the following so go ahead and add the following so i'm going to say add sidebar option so sidebar option oops upside option underscore underscore active right or in bem what you can actually go ahead and do is use bem so bem the correct way of doing this is you have a modifier so you do this you say dash dash active because we're modifying the state of sidebar option which is actually a really cool thing to show here so we go ahead save that and it's pretty fired it onto the same line and then what we can go ahead and do is go and target this so sidebar active inside of sidebar options and we can pretty much go ahead and say if you're active then we want the color of the text what are we trying to do sunny like what are we functionality was trying to achieve no coding stuff yeah so functionality wise whenever you sort of land on the home on the twitter like home screen for example by default you see the twitter ico the home icon is lit up blue because it's active ah yep it's active i see yeah so whenever you're going to different pages you want that one to have the active prop so we're showing you how to set that up as and have it by default as the home page got it okay awesome yeah because right now in our app we don't have any active props so by default home should be active exactly exactly so in this case as soon as i do that and i click save now we should see the home icon is actually becoming active because it got past the active prop so by default now that that one's going to be highlighted as blue so we already got that nice functionality everything works very slick so that's awesome the next thing we need to do inside of sidebar is we need to go to so let's go ahead and remove our command here now we need to go to the button right so we need a button here so what i'm going to go ahead and do is i'm going to use a material ui button and all the differences is it's just literally a capital b instead of a normal b material ui and then i don't know why it does this annoying issue let's go ahead and do this and then the button is just going to say tweet right tweet and i need to import it from material ui so i'm going to go ahead and do that up at the top so to import it i go ahead and paste the following so i need to go ahead and do this because i think you need to scroll a little bit to the left there we go so we've got import material important button from material ui core and then here you can see that we we have a button so for example if i save it now you'll see that a button should have popped in on the uh bottom left so if i save let's go ahead and save and show button should after it hot reloads it should say tweet on the bottom left it's quite slow sometimes when it does the hot reloading that's right there you can see there it's got tweet yeah so with that said now we want a variant which is basically a different style that is provided by uh material ui and this one's called outlined and this will change the look and feel of that button so it will now pop up with a outline looks which is a bit more flat a bit more cleaner and it's sort of what we want to go with and we're going to give it a class name because i want to style it so i'm going to give it a class name of sidebar i'm going to just call it tweet right because it's the tweet button and then i'm also it also has another property called full width and full width is built into you know where you're writing oh okay yeah as soon as you start going across like that just let me know so i can follow you because other because otherwise it doesn't show to anybody oh yeah yeah i'll definitely keep an eye on it nice so full width then you can see now the tweet button spans across right but obviously we need that button to look a lot more like it does on the actual um on the actual twitter website right so if we now go over to our sidebar.css we can target this sidebar tweet right so if i go to sidebar css and actually go ahead and target this what i can do now is i can actually go ahead and add the following so i want it to be a background i want the background color of the button to be the twitter color so i can use our variable and i need to give it uh this important tag right so it's question mark important and basically that's because we're overriding the material ui theme so basically as soon as i do that you see the tweet comes in right yeah there's a few other things we don't want a border we want the color of the text to be white and i want the font weight to be a little bold so i'm going to go ahead and add the following so these do those things exactly so as soon as i save that uh you'll see the tweet comes in now what is this for this tweet thing is it for this one you're trying to build that oh this tweet button on the sidebar yeah the two buttons okay yeah got it i'm gonna put that at the top every time you're building anything just like let me know functionality wise what we're building and then i can just have it at the top so everybody could see it yeah i think right now it's mainly just building out the sidebar yeah that's what we're doing i am focused on that yep yeah nice so let's uh continue on so we've got the fun weight of 900 and then what we're going to do is the text you saw guys by default it basically uh capitalized everything so to get rid of that you say inherit sex transform inherit and what that does is it basically inherits the value from its parent which is basically normal as opposed to what whatever material ui does uh so it gets rid of that that auto capitalization and then we're going to love what's right garden tips he says i like the community and interaction i don't understand react and i don't want to learn it but your still your interaction is just awesome and then savaram says same i also just watch for the interaction they're awesome savaram is actually a flutter developer oh nice awesome i actually want to get involved with yeah yeah and i told him to message me on instagram and he has and i said hey make savara make actual videos and send them to me of you speaking and everything just like how we do it of you building flutter apps because we can have you teaching flutter on this platform yeah that'd be so dope obviously that would be really fun awesome so now we're going to add border radius height and a margin top so it's not so close to the last value and i do save and guys a few people asking what important is and it's basically going to override material ui's uh default styles that's why we need to have that if we don't have that it doesn't material ui takes precedent and it looks the way that material ui wants it to look hey we just broke over 10 000 views we're actually at 12 000 views right now total for this stream so thank you guys really appreciate you and uh yeah let's keep on going thank you so much guys amazing stuff right so now what we're going to do also cause if you go ahead and click the tweet button notice how there's like a really nice ripple effect right so that's another big benefit hold on they can't see it so i have to hide us boom oh that looks clean look at that yeah you get this like that's by default with material ui which if you was coding that naturally i don't even know where you'd begin with coding that like so just using the library gives you some packs like that right which is awesome um nice so now what we're gonna do um is basically go ahead and create i think we're actually done at this point with the sidebar so awesome yeah we're actually done with the sidebar yep nice yeah so we're done with the sidebar so the next step is actually hold on right down to the sidebar let's go hey gotta hit him with that and now next up is what so this is good whenever we get done just yeah let us know we're done with that and then let's have a hard transition add in some poo poo poo and then let's get clear on what we're gonna be building next visually and then we'll start coating it up so what are we now gonna work on we're working on the feed and yeah we're going to actually so i'm going to create both of these components and then i'm going to basically uh handle the way that they're spaced inside of the screen and then we're going to focus on so the main thing right now is actually feed let's just focus on the feed yeah got it okay yeah so we're gonna add the feed in guys now so the feed is that nice little place where all the posts on twitter live yep beautiful awesome amana says i feel you i could hit the thumbs up a million times and he goes i'm actually going to do that buzzfeed red says amazing managing team nice community interaction yep we're going to make sure we are trying to interact with almost every single person and i am looking at all the comments so if you guys see my eyes looking this way i'm looking at your comments reading them sometimes i'll even respond to a lot of them and then bring them up albert duke but says sonny i really love your coding style it's still i'm really learning a lot thank you dude really glad that i can provide some value with that and uh yeah keep watching nice awesome let's carry on guys so we're gonna go ahead and create the feed component so eventually the goal is to basically just have it like this where we have feed and it renders out that middle section so i'm going to go ahead and create that file otherwise it's going to scream at me for not working so we're going to say feed.js and we should pop into that file now so feed.js awesome and i'm going to do rfce and it should yes we have our snippets nice and basically with the feed what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually go ahead and have so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm just going to kind of draft this out again guys so at the top of the feed we kind of have this uh we have a header right we have a header at the top of the feed and then we have a tweet box so that's basically where you can tweet something and then we have a bunch of posts right so we have like a post and then basically we have x and like however many posts are rendered out right so that's our layout for the feed so at the top of the feed just so that we can see everything's working now let's go ahead and add h2 and we're just going to say this is the home right it's the home page so i'm going to go here and i'm going to go ahead and import this so i'm going to say import import sidebar so i'm going to change it to import sorry not home feed there we go and then i'm going to go ahead and save this file so it should pop in there we go and now you can see at the bottom it says home right and this the reason why it's coming under there is because by default this container so what i mean by this container is this app container so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of the hello clever programmers message by default this i can get rid of that comment as well by default guys the app container does something called display inline which basically stacks things on top of each other which is why the feed is appearing underneath it right but if we go ahead and go to app.css and i go ahead and change this so i go to the app and i basically go ahead and do display flex what this is going to do now is it's basically going to change the rules so that sidebar feed and anything else goes into a row right so because over here sidebar is on the left and then feed is in the middle whereas our feed was at the bottom now i'm actually starting to see it in being in a row yeah so now it's in a row right so we've got the sidebar and then the feed is actually now to the right of the sidebar yes now both components are in a row right oh interesting this is a row it doesn't look like a row yeah it doesn't actually look like a row but we've actually got two children there that are in a row yeah right as opposed to in a column so with that said now what we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and add the following so right now because we did that we made it display flex uh i want to go ahead and also i forgot to do one thing on that sidebar um what i want to actually do is or we could do it on the feed itself actually we could say um what should i do hey we just got a donation let's go be shake with the uh one dollar or more donation thank you so much really appreciate it thank you so much dude appreciate that awesome so with sidebar yeah okay so for the sidebar i forgot to add one thing so let's go ahead and add a border um so if we go to sidebar i'm actually going to go ahead and say so right now you guys can see we made the container the app flex right which made it in a row but i want to basically do a few rules here so firstly i would just want to give the sidebar a um a border right so i'm going to go ahead and do the following so i'm going to say border right one pixel solid twitter background color so we're using this as our background color which is like a gray all right as soon as i do that you'll see that like you wanna you wanna do something with this twitter icon at the top yeah we'll start with that as well yeah okay yeah so we've got the uh the yeah yeah we didn't start that one awesome nice catch so we're gonna drop down in the comments below actually oh awesome thank you guys we got kenai all right so now we've got the um we're gonna go ahead we added a border right but basically firstly you also want to make it so that because the app container we said to it become like a flex container right so we also want to say we want the sidebar to always use up 30 of the screen so because that's like a nice equal share of the screen and that's how twitter kind of do it so if i go ahead and add flex 0.3 that says use up 30 in the screen right at this point in time it's already using up pretty much 30 so we didn't see much difference we also don't want it to shrink to a point where you can't see anything so i'm going to go ahead and add a min width of 250 pixels right which means that like don't shrink any more than 250 pixels right but we can we can go ahead and comment this out for now because we just wanted to sort of be as responsive as possible for now but that's how you do that and stop it from shrinking anymore and then i want to say i don't want it to touch the top of the screen so i want to do min a margin top of 20 pixels um marginal opportunity pixels i'm going to say give it a little bit of padding on the left and right of 20 pixels right so padding on the left let's give it 20 pixels and padding on the right 20 pixels so it just looks a bit more cleaner so padding left padding right there we go and now if i save this we actually go ahead and we have a perfect looking sort of sidebar right and i'm going to go ahead and style that tweet so we saw the twitter icon in over here so if we go to sidebar let's go ahead and open the sidebar to our icon so in order to style this guys i need to give it a class name of sidebar twitter icon so i need to go ahead and give it a class name here so sidebar twitter icon like this and for this what i need to do is i need to go ahead and do the following so i need to target so sidebar twitter icon and basically i'm going to give it the color so the color of this i want to be blue so i want to be the color of twitter so we use our nice little variable here which is always kind of handy to chuck in also we remember any um icon is actually a font right so if you guys didn't know it's actually a font in the icon so 30 pixels if we do dash important it's because um exclamation marking point is because we're going to override material ui steam if i save that we'll see that it goes blue and it also becomes bigger now to push it in line with the rest of them i'm going to add a margin left and a slight bit of margin underneath it and if we save that now it'll go perfectly in line and we can see that there we go there we have the finished product when it comes to the sidebar right so that's really nice to see for app.css jumping back now what we're going to do is we're going to make the view height 100 view height so if we go to height 100 vh you'll see that border actually will now touch the bottom so before i didn't have that it wasn't actually touching the bottom so if i go ahead and undo that you see that where that that border on the sidebar it didn't actually touch the bottom so i need to go ahead and add a height of 100 view height so a height of 100 view height and that will actually stretch that border to the bottom because it now lets the component use up the entire height of the screen okay and also you'll notice that if you go onto twitter so because you go into twitter make it full screen right so make it notice how there's actually a max width here right it's very you might not be able to tell but the screen is like it's there's got a max width so it's not stretching anymore so you see like you add some padding to the left to add some padding to the right oh it's actually adding margin whoa we got a thousand wow that is huge simba holy crap i really appreciate it he gave us a that's like 12 donation or 14 donation and he said i have so many udemy courses which are unfinished most mostly because the instructor gets boring eventually but you guys teach more interactively keep us entertained with jokes and love sonny's tricks i love that guys that just reminded me i got to bring in my freaking gifs hot nice thank you bro appreciate you thank you so much dude awesome right so and now what we're going to do is we are going to yes you see on the twitter app they have like a max width here right so they automatically add some margins as soon as it hits that max width we want the same behavior inside of our app so right now because if you go to localhost and you make our localhost full screen look what happens you see like we don't have any of that behavior right we don't have any of that behavior right now so what we need to do is we need to go to app.css and add a max width of 1300 pixels because that's what they use on twitter it's about 1300 pixels which means that once it gets to a certain size make it that 800 pixels and then how do we center it right because if you're making a max width it's going to be kind of shoved to the left so what we do is the trick to centering is you say margin left and margin right of auto so automatically sent to doing that we're also going to add a little bit of padding i think another thing that's amazing about teaching it being able to teach it to you guys live is we can get instant feedback so if there's something confusing we'll start seeing it in the chat and then instantly be able to handle it if there's something that doesn't make sense or need more explanation you can't do that if you're just recording a video we won't be able to get that feedback from you guys so that's why it's helpful when you guys drop in all those things on the side just like some person said hey your twitter icon is unfinished boom we just finished it up right away and explained it right away exactly and also really good comment uh from the grace there you go sonny if my flex goes over a combined 100 what happens and how can i check easily spent a lot of time on this today so it's actually a lot of practice is going to help you sort of get over that issue uh the more you kind of think about everything in sort of containers and abiding by flex rules you'll get better at understanding how things are positioned but remember what he's talking about here guys is for example we just set a rule here for the sidebar so if we go into sidebar we said the sidebar should take up 0.3 and then eventually for the feed we're going to say it should take up 0.4 which adds up to 70 0.7 and then we basically have 30 left to allocate to the widget that's what he's saying and that has to add up to 100 otherwise the responsiveness doesn't add up right so you need to make sure that you do that yeah you basically gotta get good at flexing so that's important i saw you lining it up i could see how it's like he's about to say something nice i like that understanding we're under our understanding is getting jacked nice so for the sidebar i'm going to basically go ahead and uncomment this out so it has to have a min width of 250 pixels now um which allows us to sort of space it a little bit more actually in this case no that's fine um if we then go ahead and make it full screen kazi let's see that max width come into play now all right let's go nice i see that little uh you did you achieve this from padding or margin so you use margin left margin right of auto so margin left boom and then margin right this is going to give padding here like this much yeah because think about what he's trying to do margin left auto is saying all right add as much margin left as you possibly can where did you add this by the way you added this right here right padding i know it in here in appdos css eyescatch okay cool yeah so then both sides are adding as much margins as they possibly can which basically naturally allows it to center oh wait let me actually see what you're talking about oh nice so you don't actually even have to define how much margin you just said hey auto it damn yep and that's like if you was to do uh if you was to comment out margin right you would then see it push over to the left yeah nice wow yeah yep that's dope okay very handy trick when it comes to sort of positioning items there's loads of tricks guys that you'll pick up like when it comes to positioning and flexbox so it really really um does um yeah really really does help you out with that so nice so with that said now we're going to carry on with the uh we're going to carry on with the we're working on feed yeah so we're going to work on the feed so here we have the feed and at the top we had this home right so it says home now this doesn't look anything like the one they have on twitter so if we go ahead and open up twitter we'll see the end goal that we're trying to achieve so because let's open up twitter yeah yep so at the top of the page we see a home right and that home is left aligned and it has this nice little square box around it right what square oh i see yeah and also notice when you scroll down notice how home sticks right so it's going to stick as well so that's going to be something we want to achieve here so okay and six right we didn't we haven't actually got that sparkling little thing on the right but we actually do achieve the exact same design i couldn't actually find an icon for that but i mean we could we could stick something in there if we want yeah somebody gave a good suggestion that said for the hashtag icon you can actually use um i like this and then just put the hashtag in there and wrap it up with icon tag oh yeah nice yeah i just wanted to provide a sort of a reusable component way so that way most people would get otherwise you could definitely do that yeah and have it uh yeah nice awesome um right yes so steve mccarthy says sunny margin zero auto does the same thing yes it does but you're also then setting a default margin of zero to the top and bottom if you don't want to do that you don't you avoid that otherwise you're making sure that it's zero on top and one got it okay awesome so and now what we're going to do is the feed so the feed we have so what i'm going to do for that header what i'm actually going to go ahead and say is give it a little div so surround it inside of a div and give that div a class name a feed header so feed header and basically go ahead and chuck this inside of that right so now we have a div with this home right so i'm going to open up the feed dot css so oh we don't actually have v.css i need to import so import feed.css i need to create that file otherwise react's gonna cry and scream so here we do field dot css and we should snap into it now there we go and what i'm gonna say here is i'm gonna say for for the feed so remember we talked about the flex adding up to uh 100 so here i'm going to say target the feed container and say flex of 0.4 0.4 right so we're only using up 70 now but it's still going to basically try and balance out so we're going to say flex of 0.4 and then we want to add a border right here so we're going to add a border right of twitter background one pixel solid which is basically going to add a sort of gray background we can't actually see that at the moment but if i was to exaggerate this to basically show you guys what i'm added there then go ahead and do the following and make it like this right then what you should be able to see is you see like like you get that red right that red sort of big block is getting added right yeah so instead of that what i'm trying to do now is basically just make it a twitter background uh of one pixel so that's why i'm added there and then what i'm going to say is the min width should be a fitting content and overflow y of squirrel and this this is important here guys so the min width is basically going to say whatever it should it must fit the content so whatever size the post is or anything that is inside of that container it has to fit that as a minimum width and then we're saying if you ever scroll like flows over so to get that scrolling function and it would say overflow y right so that's very important and we'll go over that in a sec um what that what that sort of does so now what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to go ahead and say for the header so for that top section right i'm going to target it so i'm going to say header feed header and i'm going to say firstly position should be sticky and this gives us that sticky functionality where it sticks to the top and in order to do that you all you need to do is say top zero all right yeah i think again exactly and then you need to give a background background color the z index of 100 and this is important so you can use any value you can use like two but i always do 100 so that you're just sure that it's on top z index is basically going to say no matter what show this on top right because it's got a high number and then i'm going to give it a border of one pixel solid and i'm going to use the background color so again you can see where the variables are coming into play guys like it's just very easy to declare a consistent styling or theme when you're using this and then i'm going to say give it a padding 15 pixels top and bottom 20 pixels left and right right yeah if i save that now we can actually go ahead and see um we can see that it looks it looks super small right now right you can't actually see what's going on there oh yeah and the reason why yeah the reason why that's happening is because we don't all right firstly i haven't saved it i don't think so if i go ahead and save it um okay so the reason why that's happening guys is because we haven't actually gone ahead and firstly i need to save feed.js that'd be helpful so let me save that yeah the reason why this is happening guys is because we've aligned not like 0.3 to the sidebar 0.4 to the feed and it doesn't know what to do with the rest of it so it's kind of just like figuring out it's like should i use some space or should i not so it kind of breaks our spacing so to fix that i'm going to add the final uh component here we're not going to build this component yet but i'm going to say widgets yeah and i'm going to give this spacing so that way we know that it's just going to use up that space so i'm going to create widget widgets dot js yeah oops uh so we're going to create that file we'll snap into that now rfce boom and i'm just going to add like a h2 saying this is widgets or something right so i'm just going to say widgets and just for now and then basically the bare minimum styling i'm going to do here is i'm going to create a css file so i'm going to say widgets dot css save that file japan jabras asks what does var twitter background mean that's a variable and css so that's what we talked about if you actually even rewind to the start of the video we talk about it but it's just a variable in css and you guys can actually use them now by the way guys just keep in mind if something important right like a lot of it is you're going to learn through pattern recognition so i know some of you guys are going hey this frontend stuff is really confusing with the flexbox and css you know i got this for you like if you guys are actually feeling a little bit like this which sometimes happens to me with front end that's completely okay just keep coming in keep practicing building up that pattern recognition and you are going to be just fine exactly love that uh nice so we just created the widgets component so i need to go ahead and import that so i'm going to go ahead and do import widgets oh god i'm going to import widgets from widgets there we go and that will go ahead and do that so we've got this now and if i save it what we're going to do is just as a bare minimal styling to fix that issue we were having before is i'm going to go ahead firstly give this a class name so we can target and we'll say class name equals widgets and i'm going to go to the css file for widgets so we'll just start css i'm going to target that and now it's going to use up the remainder so it's going to say 0.3 right so now we should see so if i save that file so it should use up 0.3 so if we make the uh that bigger in our kazi so if we make the our screen a little bit bigger yep now we can we should be able to see so let's go ahead and figure out why that's happening so app we've said has display flex and yes so what app js is display flex and then the feed and the widgets feed.css is 0.4 and then our feed.css is 0.4 yep and then in the widgets we've gone ahead and done flex of 0.3 and i need to save this file for it to maybe take effect right nice so now in the feed oh right okay sorry that's why yeah so remember guys we added in the feed and then min width should be fit content if i go ahead and save this now and get rid of this it should actually go ahead and use up more of that room but the reason why is basically because it hasn't got content to sort of fill it out right so this is fine for now actually it just looks like it's incorrect but it's actually okay for now um so okay so moving on so we've got the feed we've got the home awesome so i'm going to go ahead and target the h2 and i'm going to say give it a bit more of a nicer text so font size should be 20 and font weight should be 80 800 so as soon as i hit save on that we should see that save is that is that actually making a difference if i do background color let's go ahead and do background color of like red for example so background color of red uhhuh let's just see if that actually changes the text save it yep i did no i feel like there's some is there some weird caching going on yeah let me uh hard refresh so command shift r on your guys's mac is hard refresh just in case there's some caching no i don't i don't really see any caching going on here man so feed.css was saying okay okay guys this is where you have to be super cl uh careful right so i actually made a big mistake here so no wonder why i wasn't making any changes is because the div here had the class name of feed so this needs to be on the outside and this div is going to have the class name of feed header all right and if i click save yeah that's somebody actually said that in the chat earlier yeah so you see that now it all sort of makes sense and everything's good okay yep there you go nice nice awesome so that's exactly what happened there and that's why and you see there's like this nasty sort of scroll bar that's there right so if i go ahead and make this bigger so if i go ahead and do like abc and i just like spam this so we can actually get some kind of like scrolling going on so if i go ahead and save save save save so now you should see now spoilable but we see that nobody wants to see that scroll bar right it's really ugly nobody wants to see that so there's a little trick you can do and these are the lines of code that you need to add to get that trick working you go to feed dot css and basically you add this so you say feed colon colon webkit scroll bar display none and this will hide it for chrome safari and opera and then for this one we can actually go ahead and add this inside of this feed up here but we're just making it very clear for you guys so we're going to say hide it for in ie edge and firefox and you basically add these lines of code and basically what this one is as soon as i hit save now you keep the functionality of the scroll but you hide the scroll bar so now cause you can still scroll so if you scroll yep you can still scroll right but but it's just we don't have that ugly scroll bar which is kind of important right so that's very very important to get that sort of styling so let's go ahead and now we can see that and also the home stuck which is good so if i go ahead and save now we can see uh there we go so we've got a nice little point now we've got that little home at the top looking the way it needs to look so the next step guys is just go ahead and create a tweet box right so now what we're going to do is we're going to create a tweet box so we can maybe actually add that as the sort of current active activity uh kazi we can add that as the current activity so building the tweets yeah building tweets cool yes this one's gonna be building the tweet box so what we're gonna do now is here we're gonna have a tweet box and this is basically gonna be that box that you can basically tweet from right it's going to have like some message and stuff like that inside of it and then you basically has a tweet button so i'm going to go ahead and create this and it's going to freak out because we don't have a tweetbox component so i'm going to go ahead and create one tweetbox.js and we should snap into the file now and then it should say rfce boom we're inside a tweet box then as usual guys we need to import tweetbox.css so i'm going to go ahead and do the following import tweetbox.css i need to create that file so tweetbox.css so i'm going to create that file and then we actually should be all good to go so now what i'm going to do guys is remember we stick by them so we need to add the class name of a tweet box so tweet box there we go and then what we're going to have inside of here we're basically going to have the um so we're going to have a very sort of more a more simplified version as as compared to the one that you saw previously we're going to have a input field which has like what's happening and you can pretty much type a message under it's going to have like a link like a a chance for you to add an image tag and then you can basically post it and you can you can tweet that out to everyone so because we want to have the enter functionality so when you can type a message and hit enter i'm going to do form it's going to be surrounded inside of a form and i'm going to have a div so first i'm going to have a div which is called tweet box input so tweet box input like this and in here i'm going to have the following so i'm going to have tweet box input and then outside that div i'm going to have a button so button and this button is going to be very simple it's just going to have tweet right so i need to import this from material ui so i need to go up to the top and say import the avatar the button from material i and now the avatar what is the avatar so in this case we're just going to work hard coding a user here so we're going to say get an avatar and advertise basically that circle little image and here we're using one from kajabi uh which is basically which is basically uh kazi's uh the the sort of clever programmer logo right so you guys can go ahead and see this right here this actually by the way i think we're actually going through a possible change oh yeah yeah so we're actually going to be rebranding clever programmer and would love to actually get your guys insight on that too at some point and i'll share some stuff with you guys along the way in the upcoming videos yeah that'll be dumb because then uh yeah we're gonna be changing that logo but for now this is the one that you guys are kind of used to you see it all the time this logo right here guys if we go ahead and click save should i need to get rid of the spacing one sec boom boom you can add any image here guys so add one of your cells um which is just a demo example so we've got the input there and then what i'm going to go ahead and do is add an input underneath it so we've got the avatar and then an input which with the placeholder of saying what's happening right so as soon as i click save now it says tweetbox is not defined in feed because we haven't imported this so let's go ahead and import that so tweet box i need to import your box import tweet box from tweet box there we go save and now we should be able to see it comes in so now we've got a bunch of things we've got the clever programmer logo we've got what's happening and we've got a tweet but we need to make that look like the one it looks like on twitter right and we're also going to have something underneath that to make it even better so we're going to have the input field of saying what's happening and i also want to have some like another input field maybe underneath it or somewhere else which is basically just going to say like something like this so this isn't on twitter but we're going to use it as a demonstration and say enter image url right and this is going to be optional um and basically you can just put an image there and we're going to use that image to basically push on a tweet if you add that in so uh just comment down here just real quick i wanted to share this with you guys as well and let me know what you guys think about this new logo design that we're trying to come up with so that's it's this design right over here i'll try to pause it here a little bit but we're not 100 on it yet but we're working on it so if you guys think this is cool or we're heading in the right direction do let us know because i want you guys behind the process because whatever the next one is going to be is going to be pretty much permanent so uh yeah i'm super excited about it yeah nice um right so with that said oh thank you louise flores you just donated 20 dollars wow whoa thank you and didn't even say anything what a boss thank you so much damn we're guys i wanted to say a few things we're at 16 000 views right now so that is huge thank you guys so much for that and then also uh in donations we're at 77 dollars for today that is huge thank you guys so much yeah i didn't realize you were up that much no i didn't i didn't realize that either all added up so thank you guys so much hugely appreciate that yeah really really love that nice all right so we have the following right now but obviously it looks really ugly we want to make this look a lot better basically what he said louis floors what he said is uh he goes let me actually pop that up on the screen as well oh yeah and he said just finished uh boot camp and this is a great addition to my learning thank you boom beautiful awesome nice and guys if you are interested in a boot camp you've never been inside of a boot camp or like you want to get involved in something like that make sure you check out the link in the description and look at the course because it's pretty much more than a bootcamp could offer so go ahead and look at that if you're interested nice um so now what we're going to do is go ahead and style this so we added the tweetbox.css file so i'm going to go ahead and pop that over here and the tweetbox.css file and now if i go ahead and grab some code so basically let's go ahead and make this look pretty so the first thing we're going to do is target tweetbox and i'm gonna say add a padding bottom so you guys are gonna see this and i love doing it like this because you're gonna see it as we change it so 10 pixels bottom and then i'm going to add a border bottom because in in twitter they actually have a border underneath it which is really nice uh but basically i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm going to say border bottom and then padding right of 10 pixels so if i save this you can see we've got like a little bit of a padding there nice and then i'm going to say for that form i want to do display flex and flex direction column and now what this is going to do is going to put the avatar and the input field on the same uh vertical axis so now if i go ahead and do that it should actually go ahead and it will do display flex flex direction column so now we should see oh sorry it's not going to do that i've got it mixed up um the tweet box input if i apply display flex to that we will then have the avatar and the input field on the same line what we just did before was actually setting the tweet box which was if we look at tweet box we can see it put this child and this child so the form they actually put the form um it said this so this child here so this one right here and the button it put that into a flex column structure which is why tweet is taking up the entire width right now all right and then we basically got the avatar and the input for looking nice the next step is i want the input field to take up the full width that it can so i'm going to go ahead and do that so i'm going to say target the input field flex 1 so i want it to take up more room than the avatar give it a margin left so it's not touching the avatar font size of 20 pixels and a border of none and as soon as i hit save on that boom look at that immediately like look at that change that it adds guys so like if i undo that so if i go ahead and comment that out this is what front end is all about so if i go ahead and comment out look how trashy that looks right that looks horrible doesn't look very nice as soon as i add this in it suddenly becomes real like as soon as i add that in boom like you suddenly get this nice crisp user experience right 55. awesome so now what we're going to do is we're going to target the button i'll never say fubar i you know if fooba used to confuse the crap out of me dude i used to be like what's going on oh frank frank [ __ ] it every time coming and swinging frank dude whatever i think that just pushed us over a hundred hey dude we just got 102 total thank you frank coming in hot with this 25 donation he goes these layouts keep getting better so many tutorials have an ugly front end this is exactly what a twitter clone should look like let's go dude my energy even if my energy is low and i haven't had my coffee frank comes in swinging and i'm [ __ ] at a tent this makes me happy dude he does dude he just comes in and crushes oh man i love that broke a hundred dollars thank you guys that is huge this is our fifth stream we're you guys helped us break a hundred dollars what the hell that is crazy massive appreciation guys thank you so much swinging okay right so guys the next step what we're going to do now is we're going to target that button inside the form so the tweet button right so instead of doing some complicated nesting i'm going to just go ahead and give this a class name of tweet box button so i say tweet box underscore tweet button so tweet button there you go oops straight button there we go nice and now what i'm gonna do is i'm going to basically go ahead and do this so tweet box tweet button and i need to go ahead and give the following so i want this to look like the twitter button so basically i'm going to apply all of the same styles that we did to the previous button inside of the sidebar so it's the exact same as before nothing different there guys so i'm gonna add the same things in but the only thing different is this margin left so margin left i'm adding now so imagine that the reason why i'm adding that is because we actually added a width of 80 pixels so we actually added a width of 80 pixels here so and then what i'm gonna do is uh one second i'm just going to turn off my flux because oh no it's freezing my computer okay ignore it anyway so margin left right now if i undo this it basically pushes that tweet button to the right so it looks like twitter right we have it like that awesome so there we go and now i want to add in one more field which is the that enter image url so let's go ahead and save that now and we should see enter image url right there so that's kind of ugly i mean i might actually change the look and feel of that so we might have it underneath maybe let's go ahead and do it like that and then let's go and give it a class name so and let's just style that so it looks kind of clean let's go ahead and do input and let's go ahead and give this one uh input image let's call it let's just call it image input like this right and this one is basically going to be like for the demo purposes of when we start pushing this into the database it's going to be used for that predominantly so if i go ahead and do this and now i want to basically say for this one we don't want any border so get rid of the border so i bought a none save it we should see that and we're going to say padding uh let's just give it 20 pixels of padding 20 pixels of padding there we go and then we should see boom okay nice and let's go ahead and make this very subtle actually do this 10 pixels everybody know that um this is here is the github repo for this if you guys want to actually get access to it the code i just dropped it in the comments below and i just put it in the description of the youtube video so it should be there if you guys go and check it out but this will have access to all the code you guys can actually click source and then you'll be able to see everything that sunny is building out right now so for example when we were building sidebar option boom all the code is here when we're building out the css all the code is right here you see we're using var twitter color so either way however you want to follow along whatever is the easiest for you you can go here and then if you want access to this and you guys like this make sure to click that star button and fork it and then that'll allow you to actually code into it and make changes to it and make it essentially your own exactly yeah definitely go ahead and do that guys because i know a lot of you guys might actually want to take this at your own pace so a really good way of doing that is by following us on um oh vinayak nirvani just donated five pounds thank you dude don't stop making these videos hold on let me pop it up let me pop it up first and then speak to it okay here we go go for it nice so he says don't stop making these videos please i learned lots of good things from your videos and you just make everything look so easy to develop i love that thank you thank you that is huge that's like eight eight dollars almost donation so thank you we're up to 109 dollars because of that vinayak thank you so much amazing massive nice so now we have everything kind of looking quite sweet we've got what's happening optional enter image url and then we've got a tweet button which is really nice right so we're going to do the functionality of things afterwards so we're actually going to leave the tweet box there so we've done that and then the next step is let's go ahead and create a post right so let's go ahead and create a post um a post is going to be something which is going to be a lot more sort of customizable because we actually want to repeat it have a lot more things up on the screen so for now what i'm going to go ahead and do is go ahead and uncomment this so we actually need to create a post so cozy let's change the uh current activity to creating a post yep or creating a post component are we done with the home the feed the tweet box yeah hey okay sweet guys you know what happens when we're done with that let's just check that right there let's go and uh we're now we're doing white sunny we are now creating the post component post oh okay so uh add ability to make a twitter post you just speak too much like a developer dude holy crap whoa we got bouchon coming in hot we gotta go in order so first come first serve bouchon coming in hot with 500 that's about seven dollars thank you so much and he says niche technology developer during the day and watching react at night is fun keep up the good work the best thing i liked is you never missed explain stuff even if you have explained it in previous videos i love that too because sunny even i notice when every single time we go into firebase and you explain what it is i love that yeah that's huge we really do try and emphasize that and if we do ever miss anything guys that's what we love about live streams you guys can just shout out this one go ahead and do it oh this one's a big one guys so mandova just dropped thank you so much for sharing the knowledge keep up the good work 24 25 guys amazing thank you we're at 140 dollars in chat guys that is amazing thank you so much we just broke 140 that's huge i think that's the most that's the most i've ever yeah i think that's the first wow thank you so much love that right so and now guys we're going to create the post component right so the first thing i'm going to do now is do post dot js post.js uh there we go and we should be in it and i'm do rfce there you go and now what i'm going to do is inside of here so post let's talk about post for a second right so the first thing we need to do is kind of import a css file because we're going to have to style it so let's do post.css get that out of the way and create the files for post.css there we go so now we go hold on hold on before you continue hold on hold on i still i want to know 100 what do you mean by that so what does that mean like when i click tweet it will post it yeah no so right now we're creating the post component first and then we'll be doing so what does that mean when you say post component that means this button right here no so if you go ahead and open twitter uh okay let me go ahead and open twitter boom hey jennifer shahady she's so awesome but go ahead what's up nice so you notice how all of these posts right so you see like this is a post you've got oh i got it this is the component we're building yeah we're going okay that component all right i'm just going to write that down right here post uh component so okay cool yeah so that changes what i say at the top as well so it's got it's not the ad about to make a twitter post it's actually the post component damn the greatest ever donated again he said wanted to make my donation this popped down the screen dude let me pop in on the screen just a second boom five four three two one here we go go for it sonny nice he says wanted to make my donation worth ten dollars as well and that's all i currently have i'm doing some things to make sure i can join pwa next week can't wait dude honestly the fact you donated anything oh yes we appreciate that so much seriously thank you so much being here yeah thank you so much seriously that's awesome yeah he donated multiple times that's so great but guys this is this is actually what we're building um and yeah suddenly every single time i want to keep i'll keep either asking you but i think that level of clarity is really important um yeah and we'll just visualize exactly what we're building and then we'll move forward agreed yeah definitely cool nice so now we're gonna do is go on with the bem convention so i'm gonna add the post class right here awesome and then what we're gonna do is uh so let's think about a post right a post has a bunch of different props they can receive so it has a display name so in this case let's look at the one on the right we've got paco sanchez which is the display name so display name right there we've got the username so the username is paco luis l so the username is something different to the display name we've got a verified right verified because some users are verified you get a nice little verified badge if you're verified and then we've also got things like a timestamp so in this case the timestamp is three hours it goes like here jennifer shahadi is verified so if you look at this little tick mark right here i mean i think everybody knows what that is but just to visualize but yeah exactly cool yeah we'll leave the time some now we'll do that one afterwards let's do the text oh actually let me actually let me do it like this sonny let's do it like this so i'm gonna draw a square around this and let's just put every single thing that's going to be a thing here so then we can know so okay so walk me through it we got what do we got we've got the display name so the ones that we're going to be doing for the post is display name we've got the username got it right we've got if the user is verified or not so if they have that little like for example jennifer shahady at the bottom has a little blue tick right we're gonna have a little blue badge icon if they're verified so let me display name boom and then username is this one right here exactly cool verified verified yeah and then we've got the text so the text is the message just posted with alongside the post yeah right we've also got an image now this can be a normal image or it can be a gif or a gif depending on how everyone says it i said jeff yeah and then we've got the avatar so the avatar is for example it could be like cars like the clever program logo or like anyone's their avatar so their their profile picture right that's gonna be the so here we have a few different things and what we're going to do is we're going to pass those in as props and is that it that's it yeah that's what we're going to be doing okay cool so awesome guys this is what we're going gonna be building and now if i contrast this with what sunny had on this side over here you guys will now see all of those things sunny is writing them here so you got the display name username verified badge text image avatar all that good stuff exactly for the likes the comments and those things we're just going to do the the sort of user interface behind it yeah but you can definitely go ahead and guys i recommend like when you actually go ahead and follow this tutorial out go ahead and take it a step further and implement those things implement the numbers implement the likes that way you differentiate yourself from just everyone else who's building the clone styling is amazing didn't know these streams and i cannot get enough of it beautiful i agree nice honestly that's how i used to like have this issue i i hated ben when i first heard of it and then i was like why do we need this and then now i live by it so i love this watch ashish says we want crazy frank and crazy quasi talking on the channel it would be so fun to watch their energies together frank swinging in always makes me happy by the reaction cozy and sunny give i love that yo sarin coming and swinging let's go sarin coming in hi uh with eight dollar donation he says i have finished my boot camp recently thanks for sharing your knowledge you guys are helping me polish my skills and learning new stuff at the same time oh man that makes me happy that's amazing appreciate that dude thank you this is insane i love the support they give all right people keep saying time stamp people keep crying like time are we going to put anything with the timestamp where it says 13h yeah so we could do timestamp the reason why i've left timestamp out now is because i want to focus more on getting everything else but with timestamps we can kind of go into it we can kind of you there's ways of manipulating time using moment.js and all that stuff but guys for now i just want to focus on a lot more of the value in the in this case it's going to be posting to a backend doing all that stuff and not messing too much around with timestamps we did do timestamp stuff in previous builds guys thank you this is the first time this has happened we have officially it hit over 150 or actually exactly 150 in chat revenue so thank you guys so much that's huge that's insane dude oh my god i remember do you remember because the first time we got a donation we were like yo i think we're going to hit five dollars yeah i mean i i will be i had never even hit over three dollars and since the four years of this channel so like when we got like three dollars four dollars almost fell off my chair and i feel like i'll keep falling off my chair because i every single time it's massive to me just a massive vote of confidence from people so it's huge definitely huge yeah awesome so let's carry on strong guys so we have the post right and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna actually gonna sort of separate everything into containers so like stick with me during this section because we have a few different containers that we're going to put in place and they all have a purpose michael is like bring in moment.js i know we'll think about it we'll think about it i think about it if we get if we get enough time then we can do it right yeah see us at office hours after the stream yeah nice so what we're going to do now is we actually are going to firstly create a div for the appetite this is where bem comes in big guys right so i'm going to make a div and i'm going to say post and this one is going to be a container around the avatar right and there's a reasons why we're going to do all this stuff and it'll make sense at the end so we're going to have an avatar here so an avatar so that's a little circle icon and i'm gonna use the one for clever programmer so this is the same link we used earlier so if you want to get that you can go ahead and use the link we used earlier so boom if you guys are wondering how to get this it's all in the github that we pushed so you guys have access to that imran says imran says i'm building all the clones which you guys are launching every day one day i will become a clone of sunny and quasi hey i love that i didn't see that coming yeah turn up sunny and cozy holy crap yeah all right all right so amanda is like let's hit 200. so we have we hit the save button on that so now we've got the avatar we should pop in right now we're obviously not going to see anything so what i'm going to actually go and do so we can see this visually let's open up and let's go ahead and pop a post in here right now and then let's go and import it so do this um and then that way we can actually visually see something which is always nice so save right so with that said now we should see that little avatar nice okay so the next step guys is we're going to create the body and the reason why we're doing this is because we want the avatar on the left and then everything on the right so we're in that little gap so i'm going to do here div dot post body so post body like this and basically here what we have is different sections to the body right so i'm going to have different sections inside the body so the first section i'm going to have is a header right and inside of the header we're going to have the sort of like the text to sort of uh if it said like kazi said this or something like that right so here i'm going to have div dot post header right and inside of the header i'm going to have first these i'm going to have some header text right so i'm going to say dev dot header text dev dot header oops post sorry post header text right and then inside of here i'm going to have a h3 and just for now we will be swapping out with the variables but i just want to do it so that you guys can see it so i'm going to say rafaeli said like oh in this case because and i'm going to span reason i'm spanning now is because i want to apply some styles in a sec to just this bit of text right so i'm going to say spam and then i'm going to have a verified badge icon so i'm just going to assume that he's verified in this case so i'm going to go ahead and do verify am i i don't even think i am actually let's go to twitter but i should be at some point no unfortunately i'm not but yeah yeah but put that badge icon next to me you know i've always wanted to see what that looks like yeah so now we'll have a verified batch it's not the exact same one that we're using we're using material ui's one as a sort of a as a replacement for it it's like a sort of shield verified outcome but you'll do a trick for this demo so we have this and then we'll say clever kazi there we go so boom all right and obviously after this oh damn my nan said missed man city versus real madrid for this awesome session dude if i knew that i might have missed this session so thank you for being here that's huge massive thank you guys hey buchan coming in hot oh nice with another six or seven dollar donation and what did he say sonny it says repeat the dollars made my three digit donation to single digit let's make it double d you guys are awesome loving the next gem folks no more interruptions carry on awesome love that thank you so much and we love double d's so let's keep going [Laughter] so now what we're gonna do is we're going to have another div under here i just thought so we have another number here of post this is going to be the header description subscription and here we're going to have a p tag and inside the here i'm going to put the following so i'm going to say p tag and we're just going to say i challenge you to build a twitter clone with the react so this is going to be a demo that we're going to have here um so like some dummy text right and then underneath that div we're going to have oh no you know when it starts you can't stop and then you got an image and then here i'm going to add an image it's just a funny little gif that i found earlier so i'm going to go ahead and pop this in or jeff i'm going to double line this so you guys can see that so uh boom so you guys can see that and you guys copy that but remember guys you can actually go ahead and use the the get uh github to go ahead and grab that so as soon as i do that you should and i'm following i'm following you right sunny yeah okay some of the code is running along so i'm just going to show it to you guys right here all right what do you want me to do let's have a look oh let's go nice all right damn that is nice but that is the ugliest verified badge you could but i mean you know it's yeah i know i know it's ugly we'll make it look a bit better oh [ __ ] okay as long as we can make it blue you know then then it's fine yeah yeah yeah we're gonna style it and it's gonna look really nice okay awesome nice so then so then underneath that image lucas says just wash your tinder clone yesterday amazing i made a tinder for cats with it that is awesome oh nice that is so cool awesome nice so now we're going to have a div for underneath and we're going to have a post footer right so this one be it post footer oops whoa i broke my ms for div post four there we go and inside of here i'm going to use four icons right so this is all from material ui we've got a chat bubble a repeat icon a favorite and a publish right and this is all sort of ones that look similar to the ones that we had and then i'm also adding the trait called font small site uh font size small that's built into uh material ui so it gives us the option to do that and then what i'm going to do is i'm just going to import those at the top so i'm going to go up to the top of the file and boom import those at the top so save and now we should be able to see so if we save it we should be able to see uh yeah we can see the icons have popped in at the bottom right so that's really nice to see now what we're going to do is make all of this look nice right so we've already we've added in all the sort of the the selectors and everything now we're going to basically use css to make it look exactly as we want it right so let's go ahead and go to post dot css so post.css over here and then what i'm going to do is go ahead and change okay so now so now what we're going to do one sec yo damn this is pretty sick check this out so um hussain says hey qazi after following your course especially those django courses attempted to create a interactive web app if you want to see it so i checked has a web app out dude um i actually went to it and look at this i had to log in and it's actually a clone of twitter oh nice it's fully responsive oh dope so let's actually test it oh damn oh nice that's what i'm talking about wow guys like then send us this on instagram tag me and quasi and we can see this stuff like we love to see this yo if you guys like this make sure you go ahead and like the video this is awesome i did i did your one from yesterday wrong but we just started who can like slide it in the smoothness right that would be the best oh this week's uh smoothest sliding goes to nice yeah yesterday i dropped one guys if you didn't see it go ahead and check out yesterday's video sliding it in like this bro check this out go for it i'm sharing it on the screen sliding it in like oh let's go all right let's get back the collection enough of the jokes so now what we're going to do is firstly i'm going to go ahead and target that image right so image right now is inside post body so i'm going to go ahead and do post body and i'm going to say border radius of 20 pixels so firstly you'll see it'll get like a rounded effect on that image so if we go ahead and save it it gives a rounded effect but you see it's like it's currently getting bigger than the screen right now which we don't want right so i'm going to do width of 100 so width of a 100 and that should give it a position which is going to be is going to be 100 relative of its container it should be in this case so if i go ahead and save that it should actually fit inside of its size so if we go ahead and make that smaller i'm just wondering did that no it didn't okay that's because we've got flex supplying okay no problem so we can do that so we don't actually need that in here at this point so you're going to take that out so let's go ahead and do the phone so we've made it sort of rounded in the corners but the actual container itself i want to do display flex right so display flex and then i'm going to do align items flex start so that way they all center at the top so align items um select start and then i'm going to give it a border bottom and a padding at the bottom as well so i'm going to go ahead and do that so following there we go oops my computer's getting a bit hot now so let me go ahead and save this might because i've got that gif running some reason yeah and then i've saved it i'm just going to use your screen as a reference nice yeah so there we go yeah and then i'm going to use uh as the box that is so jacked and now and for the footer what i'm going to do is you see all those icons right if i do display flex justify content space between and give it a little margin at the top that will actually go ahead and spread them out evenly so if i go ahead and do that it spreads about evenly which is really nice right and then what we're going to go ahead and do for the badge so i gave the badge um a class name of post badge so what i'm going to go ahead and do nice i see what you mean yeah it's it's over spread across evenly looks nice yes and so now you're going to make the badge blue yep so that badge i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm going to say post badge keep an eye on that you bad boys how am i doing post badge on size of 14 pixels and a color and i'm going to use the twitter color variable to go ahead and make it the blue this one is for the boys check it out look at that your boy has been verified let's go exactly it gives a nice little finishing touch there for the header sort of the the special text and that and what i'm referring to there is where we spanned remember we added a span so i need to actually go ahead and add a uh a class name there so where we span some text of where we had the username so i actually went and added a class name here post header special and what i'm going to do there is basically wherever we have the username and that stuff i want to just want to add a bit of styling there so i'm going to go ahead and say give it a fun weight of 600 a smaller font size and give it a gray color and now we should see where it says clever kazi that should change i need to save both files now as soon as that refreshes you see cleverkaze came a bit smaller which is nice right for the header text so i'm going to target so i'm going to go into that container target the header h3 and change the font size 15 pixels with the margin bottom you should see that i've changed as we did that it made rafe kazi a bit smaller with the margin underneath it and then we're also going to go ahead and add in for the description so the header description we have a margin bottom of 10 pixels and a font size of 15 pixels so that will go ahead and change that there we go nice for the post body i'm going to give it um a flex so i'm going to say display flag a flex type of one which it knows to use up as much as it can and then i'm going to say give it a padding of 10 pixels so that's why it's also pushed the things across to the right and then for the avatar just so that it right now it's super cramped all right so i'm just going to give it 20 pixel padding so boom there we go i'm going to go ahead and give it 20 pixels of padding and there you go so now if we make that full screen there you go yep nice check that out guys so that looks clean all right see it looks designed to look a lot more like a post right so now if i go and do for the header footer margin top did i do that yeah margin top make that margin up a little more drastic so 20 pixels maybe yeah so we get a bit more spacing there it's looking clean now bro yeah so it's starting to get that nice sort of feel to it um awesome so with that said now what we're going to be doing is moving to the so imagine now guys like if i have the feed right if i go ahead and like basically add a bunch of posts now right so they're all going to be the same post because i haven't actually passed through any props yet which we'll be doing later with with the firebase stuff so now you can see because if you open up the feed so check this out so boom we've got this nice little functionality right look at that so it's really clean really really nice layout um and you can see guys like very quickly you start to see an app right you can start to see a very functional app right so what we're going to do is we're going to touch base on the functionality side of things afterwards but what we're going to do for now is actually go over to the widgets so we actually just wrapped up on the feed right so we'll be coming back to the feed afterwards to sort of handle the functionality for now what we're going to do is move over to the widget so an app.js we have the last part which is widgets right so let's go ahead and update the text so on the screen now do what are we saying working on the widgets yeah nice so dope so then now what we're going to do inside of widgets widgets is essentially that right side and what we're going to do is we're actually going to do something pretty cool here we're going to use a few different plugins to go ahead and make this look the way we want it so uh that's the thing that's the thing that on this let me go to twitter oh man my computer's starting to freeze please don't die on me okay this is all that what's happening in who to follow section yeah exactly and in this case we're going to be pulling using a special library called react twitter embed right so what i'm going to firstly do is actually go ahead and install that in the console so um let me see if i can see so in the console if you if you do command j on the console give me one second i will do it right now boom there we go yep and now what i'm going to do is mpm oh so you need to open up uh the third console oh no wait the second one it's the second one um oh yeah there we go yeah so now when the mpmi i'm basically gonna do oh i need access one sec i need to i need how do i request access for that i do live share papa it's not even right you need write access yeah i got it yeah there you go you're good mpm i and i'm going to do react twitter embed right so show the yep so there we go npm i react to it so just do uh command b so they can see it yep you got it boom nice so back to him and we're gonna install that guys and basically that's going to give us three very handy so there's a bunch of things it gives us you guys can go ahead and check out the documentation on that uh library in npm but we're going to use a twitter timeline between a share button and the twitter tweet embed just so you guys can get a sort of feel for what it does right so we're going to come to that in a sec and that's going to take a minute to just install but before we do that what i'm going to do is add the search field right so at the top what i'm going to do is add the following source a div which has the class name of widgets input so here div widgets input and then i'm going to do this like this so and then what we're going to do is have inside of that a search icon with the class name of search icon and this is going to be pulled in from material ui so it's just going to be a search icon from the icon library so i'm going to go ahead and do that there we go and then i'm going to go ahead and grab an input field which has a switch which just says a placeholder of such twitter and it has type is text and we're using react yeah we're using react twitter embed so i've popped up alexandros comment on the screen and he's showing you guys what to write to install it npm i react twitter embed nice awesome yeah and now what we're going to do is we have that in place and then i'm going to go ahead and say another one i'm going to call this one the widgets widget container because this is the one that's going to make use of all of these sort of fun quirky uh sort of that plugin that reacts with your embed stuff so yeah it's inside and quirky embed like this one over here the kids let and then let's add a h2 which says what's happening right so we saw that was in the original one and then the first thing we're going to do guys is actually go ahead so right now what we might have to do cause is scroll to the right on the um on the local host so we can see what's happening all right and also i will put this down so you can have more view and let's go to the local host oh i see my fancy search functionality kicking in yeah what we might have to do now is make it possibly um push this on the left side and have the code on the right maybe um because it's not it's not going to show this part of the screen every time we just have the code here you can see on you i got you some yeah something like that yeah i got you i got oh snap son snap city let's go i mean i could have just scrolled it bro that would have been fine no no but now what happens is when it hot reload is going to jump back so you might actually have to make the window bigger and then sort of pop it you see i mean go into the left oh so make the window bigger i got yeah i got you here we go damn bro not only are we developers but know how to use the computer too yeah problem solvers so and then what we're going to do is i'm going to show you guys the first example which is called twitter embed right so i'm going to do this twitter embed right here and basically this is a tweet from qazi and it's basically a tweet regarding i think it was about the python it was a python post that you've done quite a while back i'm going to go ahead and save that and check this out so as soon as i do that we should actually see on the left side now see what's happening and in a second that looks right yeah i love that yeah so we get that as the first thing and the second one we're going to do this is actually a timeline feed from karzi's account so you can actually go ahead and change this with your twitter profile if you go ahead and change this the screen name and then you can also pass in options here if you want to change the styling of it so we're going to go ahead and add that one so if we save that in now that will actually show the latest tweets that are on kazi's account so there you go that's a real live stream of tweets what's happening right now so you can see it's pulling in the tweets of the bomb awesome steve is back his video call he had a meeting with his devs and now he's like the call is over the devs are happy let's get back to it nice awesome so now we are going to do um i'm going to paste in the twitter share button as well so that was kind of cool and it's just like an example of what you can do with these sort of packages this one if you click it it will take you to facebook.com for slash clever programmer and then the text says react.js is autumn via cleverkaze so now if you actually go ahead and scroll down uh because yes if you go ahead and scroll [ __ ] reaction speed can't spell reaction without react bro let's go see that twitter share button so if you scroll down on the the right side now so you see where it says what's happening on the action oh yeah yeah yeah no that looks clean you see the little tweet button at the bottom uh they can't see it so i'm gonna have to holy crap man i have to do some really weird stuff now it will be visible soon hopefully there now they should be able to see it so if you click that tweet button that will take you to twitter and you'll actually have a share post on it and it will actually attach the the the parameters that we passed in so it's really quite clever sort of plugin damn i see it i see it and now everybody sees it too also right so that's just from that little simple like and guys this is an example of like using thirdparty libraries makes your life so much easier and it's something that you guys should definitely go ahead and do uh when you're coding so with that said let's go ahead and make this section really nice right so we went ahead and created a widgets.css so now i'm going to go ahead and do the following so i'm going to open up my widgets.css uh if my computer decides to breathe it's got a comment by epic zeus epic zeus is back in the house and epic zeus says i want to join profit with javascript training only thing that is keeping me away is the thought that are the training modules as interactive like these live videos what do you say sunny yeah so my advice here guys is the way i teach it or the way i sort of tell students is you should always have kind of a split right you should always have like a a sort of an area where you can go at your own pace and that's what we really built the training modules for you can take those training modules go through the fundamentals at your own pace which is really important right and then you have a third of your time with like when you for example with us and then the live clients on javascript yeah so we have those and that's where you really get pushed intensely right so really that we take you to that sort of uncomfortable stage um and then you also have like the other side where it's basically you start teaching other people so we teach you all of this in the course but that's the main purpose of to answer and to answer your question it's even more interactive because you're on a zoom call so sunny can actually see you we have you turn your video on as well sunny and nas all those calls so then you can actually speak back to us like right now there's massive engagement right we're sharing your comments imagine if you're in interface will be like hey epic zeus or whatever your real name is like did you get this thing done show me your code that's why it doesn't work this is why it's wrong this is what you can do to make you know what i mean like it's very just boom boom boom so yeah and we do like we really aggressively do call out students and we make sure everyone's progressing so something to definitely bear in mind if you're on the chance of joining nice so what we're going to do now is target and i love what vague says by the way so vivek says epic zeus is really good to be honest i've recently joined the course it motivates you to learn coding i will give five stars to the course amazing thank you so much vivek yeah glad you're enjoying it and i'll see you on the coaching call yeah yeah nice um let's go so now what we got is uh yeah so widgets input so i'm going to do display flex on the input so this should actually go ahead and i'm going to align item center give it a background color of the twitter background which is like a gray padding and here i'm going to pop it on and then you guys i'll explain it as we see it so i've done a bunch of styling some margins some border radius etc so now you'll see at the top the search has changed right but the input hey epic zeus i'm sorry bro i know you want to keep coding but i'll i'm sorry and to everybody else who's watching but this is too awesome episode says joining tomorrow let's go well as soon as you join we see it actually come through and uh we get on calls with a lot of the people who we get on a call with every single person that actually joins so if that happens we're going to give you a shout out and you're welcome to jump on the skype call with us or the live stream with us tomorrow too exactly yeah definitely do that and um yeah if you join like jump into the coaching coin tell me that tell me your your tag is fxus and i'll we'll have a chat nice um awesome leroy says if sonny was my javascripts uh in my college i would be starting react nine to five i love that thank you dude uh so i'm gonna go ahead and add so i'm gonna target the input field and i'm going to say give a border none and give the background color to be twitter background color as well so if i save this uh you'll see now that it blends in with that so all right so we get that uniform sort of look and the search icon just one shout out for everybody who wants to join profit with javascript uh this is not a marketing tactic we are the subscription plan we're probably actually gonna move away from it pretty soon so um probably in the next two weeks or less it's going to be gone and the only plan that's going to be there is going to be the one time full price and it's going to be somewhere like 500 to higher than that so just something for you to be aware of if you're curious about it you know you can get it it's still a really good deal yeah exactly like guys like like if you're paying the current price now per month it's actually going to be easier for you guys to pay that as opposed to what it's going to become in the next two weeks so definitely go ahead and if you're on the fence consider joining now and you'll keep hold of that price by the way if you join now it won't change for you if you join yeah awesome so um what we're going to do now is also go ahead and style the search icon so i'm going to go ahead and do this so boom search icon and that tends to search i can color gray and then what i'm going to do is actually target the widgets container right so that container that holds everything that we have inside of it i'm going to go ahead and do widgets container and i'm going to do the following so margin top 15 pixels left 20 pixels padding around the entire inside 20 pixels background color of this off gray so it's not the typical twitter gray otherwise i would use the variable and the border radius of 20. now check this out kazi if you open up the uh the left screen so i can just see it a bit more yeah right here you got it as soon as i hit save now look at that container where it says what's happening and boom there you go it gets a lot more of a nicer ui to it right yeah and the final thing there guys to really wrap up that widget section is to target the what's happening text so i'm going to say font size of 18 pixels front weight of 800 so it's slightly bolder and as soon as i do that there we go it's much nicer much smaller and that wraps up the widgets section so that's a really nice way to end the widget section um so this is exciting right now so we've actually got to a really cool point so we've showed you guys so let's go ahead and show them the uh the app right now because on full screen we don't need to do this weird sort of left side stuff anymore nice yeah so that's actually like so the app looks clean right now yeah damn yeah hey guys if you like how this app is looking and you like the app then go ahead and like the video that would be awesome thank you guys smash that thumbs up guys if you're still here as well amazing how many views are we on right now uh we are at right now oh snap doodle we just broke 20 000 views let's go i was wondering i was like yeah sure we must have cracked it by now yeah and uh we got the greatest ever saying it's amazing how long one can code when they have such amazing interfaces my apps are looking incredible and lol today i worked on them for eight plus hours again and still had great fun which was shocking do you know what i love that so much because the fact we're helping people motivate for like eight hours coding sprees is so nice to hear like really really cool to hear that so i love that i feel like and just us sitting here coding for like four hours or six hours straight i think it's also like developing that muscle in a lot of people who are watching that it's okay like look we're here doing it you can be doing it for six to ten hours a day no problem because i think that's actually one of the biggest advantages i feel like i had in coding i could just sit there for 15 hours a day so it doesn't matter even if i'm like dumb and it takes me six hours just to even get started but by the time that i get started between six hours and the 15 hour mark i just fly yeah exactly definitely and i think you're right like it does it helps build that confidence with a lot of people when it comes to those longer hour sessions because we're doing it right here in front of you guys um so we're not just saying that we code for 10 hours we're literally doing it here with you guys david says please what's the duration of the entire profit javascript program guys it's uh the the training material that should last you three months okay and so three months of training is gonna get you where you need to go and you're gonna start being able to earn an income if you put in the work after the three months the program will still continue for you because we're gonna be giving you the live coaching calls ongoing for the whole year yeah exactly so guys like yeah the live the once you're done with the material the training is ongoing so you have those coaching calls available every single week to really keep track of your skills and keep like progressing and another really important thing you guys this is going to be huge we're super excited for it but the channel right now is at 692 000 subscribers because of you guys so thank you so much and our growth has never been more than now ever before and if you guys look our subs are actually going crazy so we were at 2k 1k and then over the last few days since we've been streaming like the growth has been amazing and you guys are just coming in with your full support and i think today we're already at 4k this just hasn't updated yet but nice help us get to the 5k a day mark we really want to grow this channel and make sure it's in front of as many people as possible so they can become better developers get job promotion so you can then you know quit out of your current like uber maybe and actually get a job as a full stack react developer or a javascript developer whatever it may be but help subscribe to the channel so it keeps going out in front of more people exactly massive like guys when we hit 650 we we were like over the moon and like the the growth from 650 to nearly 700 is insane so like yeah i'm gonna keep it going yeah i think at this rate i mean i feel like it might be two days away right or one and a half day away from hitting 700k subs which is like what the hell it's just yeah i think literally yeah within two days i think we'll hit that yeah amazing yeah all right thank you guys so guys we just created the sort of front end and but now remember i said we're gonna go back to that functionality on the posts right and we're gonna get the to the juicy stuff right now so if you guys are excited for firebase and seeing how we use firebase smash the thumbs up button if you already haven't already and let me know in the comment section so let's kind of pump the energy back up because we're about to show you guys some really cool stuff with firebase right now hey are you guys ready and are we done with the are we we're done with the widgets right yeah we are done got the little thing going and now what are we working on sunny so now we are working on actually getting um the database uh or deployment now we're actually gonna get the database and we're basically gonna be so yeah setting up five uh setting up the database yeah all right so add real time database with firebase beautiful we got that at the top let's get rocking and rolling so i'm in my twitter clone and what's next i gotta hit if you guys haven't done this step yet guys make sure you go to firebase.com go to the console and then create a new app we just called it twitter clone now once we're in here we're going to hit this web button and i'm going to go twitter clone also set up firebase hosting bada bam bamba boom register app so um you guys are amazing i'm going to buy your course beautiful would love to see you inside the program love to see you inside dude all right here we go next uh make sure you guys are installed just joined actually really yeah somebody just i just got um something come through it might be delayed but uh may come through in a sec what's the name uh let me see it doesn't tell me yeah it doesn't tell me it just got an email that pinged through so we should get it while we're on the stream the name damn nice okay all right we're just waiting for them to make their username you know and then as soon as their username it'll send us yeah all right firebase wait what happened next next cool guys make sure you use this and install firebase tools we're not gonna do this command because we already have it installed and then just the three commands are going to be useful later on and now i'm going to continue to console now what are we doing sonny are we going to uh project settings yes project settings and we need to grab the config cool so we got a web app at the top and i'm going to go ahead and grab this config and now i'm going to put this on this side guys go here bada bam bada boom create is firebase.js okay firebase.js and pop in all your config stuff right in here and then what's next sunny exactly so that's the next step guys and then what we're going to do is open up the terminal and what we need to do now is actually pull in firebase into the into our project so we do mpmi firebase oh my bad my bad bro my bad hold on that's not gonna work yep i got overzealous that's right i'm typing it in mpmi firebase there oh god damn it oops that's not going to work either let me go ahead let me do it ctrl z there we go mpm i firebase there we go um so once we do that guys uh it's going to pull in all of this stuff so while while that's actually loading we can actually go ahead and carry on um so let's go and find that firebase file that kazi created awesome and what we're going to do is we're going to import firebase from firebase at the top of that file so i'm going to go to the top i'm going to say import firebase from firebase and then underneath what i'm going to say is basically this is very powerful guys we've done this in the previous tutorials as well but just to show you guys how easy it is to connect everything together because you're going to scroll down a little bit so we can see the um yeah right there there's actually we can do come on j we can actually close the um let's do it yeah boom so firebase app firebase initialize app and firebase config so that's the firebase config right there boom now this is pretty much our like portable database okay we're just gonna put in our pocket and then any other file that we go to app.js or anything else we can actually just use this firebase app so we can just use that database variable and then we'll have access to it boom right there so that db yeah we're just carrying in our pocket this how i think of it and then boom you use it anywhere else yeah exactly oh frank joined frank vermouth nice hey frank ramos just joined i don't know if it's our frank but it doesn't matter whoever it is it's our frank now because they're in profit they're one of us exactly welcome to the team dude awesome hey frank thomas yeah yes right so we have the widget container oh yeah sorry i'm looking at yeah so here guys we've got the db right so we initialize the app and basically what we did there is we basically connected firebase to the backend so very very simple stuff uh very very simple because of firebase right and then exporting it allows us to basically go into any file and pull the database in right so that's what we're going to basically go ahead thank you so much ritik for the donation and also daniel cortez for a four dollar donation that is beautiful we are at 161 it is our frank hey let's go nice that's what i'm talking about man frank just goes just join profit with javascript yo frank just coming in swinging nonstop i love it that is that energy we need can't wait to see you in the coaching course dude yeah that is awesome nice right so now we have access to the db right so it's literally as simple as that guys right to access the db so now we need to go back to firebase and we need to go ahead and set up the database classy okay beautiful um yeah so i'm going to go ahead what do you mean okay all right i got you don't worry don't worry i'm just looking at chat messages all right because the greatest ever just goes frank i'm going to be joining you soon buddy so that's pretty awesome all right so now guys make sure you click database on the left hand side here here cloud firestore realtime updates powerful queries and automatic scaling just hit create database right there make sure you start in test mode hit next leave that default hit done yeah wait for it and then as soon as this is done we can actually start using a realtime database and you guys will see how easy that thing is that thing is freaking sick yeah unkit sharma best channel for react nice we love that dude awesome right so what we're going to do now guys is i'm just going to go ahead and we need here is the line 14. he says can you show us line 14 can't see it here it is okay i'm showing it a lot so you guys can just pause it rewind dj with it but it's there nice awesome so what you do now uhhuh go for it yeah so before we actually mess around with the database anymore we need to do a little bit of refactoring so we actually had the post right the post was using like the display name username verified text image avatar right but we hardcoded those values so cause you just go ahead and pop open the code uh pop okay so these are hardcoded right this is what you're talking about yes yes and we wanna be pulling it from our own database yeah we wanna do that but first we need to actually be able to pass through the props right so we need to show let's show the code for a sec so we have the post right so uh you need to follow me i think yep right there there we go so now guys we see we've got the display name user all this stuff as props right and what we're going to do now is inside of our feed you see we're just rendering out at the same post every time right now what we want to do instead is i can remove these comments we'll do instead now is i want to go ahead and pass through the props so you can see we've got a bunch of props here so in this case let's go ahead and say display name so display name equals in this case let's do uh sunny sanger and then let's do username oops username equals let's just do my instagram so sssanga uh and then let's just do verified so i don't even have a verification but let's just call myself verified text in this case to say let's just say yo it's working so let me go ahead and drop this it's easy to see so what is this verified verified is equal to verified is that what that is no that if you do a boolean basically that got it that's true yeah so here we can say yo it's working right and then uh i'm gonna basically have uh for the avatar what i'm gonna do is just keep the same type of program i want so i'm going to say avatar let's just do avatar equals the cover program one and then i'm going to say for the image we're going to go ahead and use the one that we used before so that gif so image equals that same gif that we used before right so it's going to be that i choose you gif that one okay so awesome now here we basically pass in a bunch of props but inside of our post we need to actually change our code so that it uses them right so now what we can do is we for the source here rather than actually hard coding this value we can actually go here and do the following we can say this should be the avatar right yeah then we can say instead of rafae kazi here i'm going to say display name uhhuh instead of clever quasi i'm going to say at username yep oh instead of text here i'm going to say at text and then the image so you can see guys now we're just feeding through the props right so it's very simple we're just feeding through the props um and also for the verified i'm going to do is i'm going to add a condition now so i'm going to say if you're verified only then do we show it so i'm going to say if you're verified so if uh so verified and and that's how we do it that's how we say if you're verified then show the verified badge otherwise don't know so now we're using all of our props and now if i go ahead if i remove these old posts now we should see now if i save it and i save the post.js i need to save both post.js and feed.js and we should see like sunnysanga yo it's working nice oh i see beautiful beautiful beautiful where is that coming from so that's coming through uh the props now so you see like it says got it that's coming through the props okay i see but not the database yet okay got it not the database yeah right so now what we want is we basically that was the first step right refactor it so we can pass in props now instead of passing these values in here i want to basically have it so that it pulls from the database and it doesn't just pull one post it could pull like 50 100 whatever it does and it just renders them out right so we're going to show you just how simple that is to do that right now guys so get ready um for what i'll show you so next place we need a piece of state right to keep track of the post so what we're going to do is we're going to use state so inside of um this is how we write variables inside of react so here i'm going to say sunny one i'm going to take on one question i think it's uh helpful for more advanced developers who are watching this channel so daniel soliado says hey i have one more question would i be able to integrate payment to a website with just react and without backend code or would i need to use something like node.js cloud functions so if you guys want to add integrate payments and things like that you will need backend code you will need server side functionality but instead of using node.js what which is something that is super amazing that you can do is use firebase's cloud functions so you just use google cloud functions and that will make they'll give you the full pure backend functionality you're looking for and you know the code is super simple when you're using firebase exactly yeah so you will need some back end to that and you can use a firebases cloud functions as far as you said uh we've actually done that so it does it we it's proof that it works um definitely go ahead and check that out yeah nice so now what we're going to do is so we've got cons posts which is the name of the variable then we write set whatever the variable is called to set posts in this case and then we need to initialize it so we say use state which is something called a hook and this is basically preparing the variable and we're going to say that the default value should be an empty array now to use this we need to go ahead and do this we need to say first you get rid of that i need to import it so i'm going to say import from react the use state right nice and then save prettier makes it look nice and then what we're gonna do is we're actually gonna so i'm not gonna i want this to be our posts right but what we're gonna do now is so let's go over to firebase right so yeah yeah yeah let's go over to firebase now so guys in firebase in the database you have a collection right so in this case what is the collection going to be it's going to be posts right so in this case let's go ahead and create a collection called posts yep and then cardi what's happening here and now guys inside of a post there are going to be like multiple other data points that are going to go in there so it's like what does a post have so in this case our post has a username our post ha oh this is a username right here right our post use the props as your reference right you can use the props as a reference exactly yep so in this case because remember your props it has to match your props uh the keys of your props boom nice so in this case let's go ahead and we can maybe change the value yeah nice awesome so each documents you have a collection and then you have documents inside the collection and each document in this case is going to resemble a post now display name is going to be string username is going to be a string this is going to be a boolean because true or false by def right now we're just gonna set it to be false uh true i mean and then username i'm gonna pop that in display name we're gonna pop that in and then uh what else do we need here so we need uh this is just gonna be a string so so let's just say uh yo it's pulling from firebase or something so that way we know it's coming from firebase nice there we go all right avatar this is going to be just a string and we're going to pop this in right there and then for the image this is also going to be a string and we're going to pop this in right over here cool and if i paste this this is the image so you guys are going to see that or sorry that's the avatar and then this is going to be the image that you guys are going to see yeah dope so this is good i'm going to hit save and now we have created a document so post at the highest level you guys at the highest level we got posts post inside of it right that's a collection inside of it you got documents so you know we got now one post we'll have multiple posts inside of our post collection exactly yeah if we make it full screen i think the firebase ui is a little bit easier to see yeah um there we go yeah so you've got a post and you've got the documents inside the post yep yeah and then they got data inside each document exactly yeah so really nice and now what we're going to do guys is we're going to basically do the magic which is going to connect so we already done the config which allowed us to connect to the database but now we're going to basically set up a listener which is going to be listening to that exact collection posts and anytime a document is added or whatever is in there currently we want a realtime listener which is going to update the posts in our state so inside of our react app and then that way we're going to render it out afterwards and it's always going to be realtime connected to our database right so let's go back to the code yeah nice and what we're going to do now is we're going to use effect so use effect basically is a piece of code that runs based on a given condition right and in this case the condition if we put empty brackets basically says run when the feed component loads so run any code that's inside of here so around any of this code whenever the feed component loads and don't run it again after right but if i was to put something like a name variable or anything in here like name age whenever run it when the feed component loads as well as when name the the name variable changes or the age variable changes so it's very powerful block of code a use effect right and we need to import it as well so at the top we can say use effect and then here we do some very very powerful stuff now so firstly we need to import the db from our local firebase file so you'd say import db from local firebase file so not the not the module firebase but the local file and then what we're going to say is db dot collection right so we're going to go to that collection and the one that we created was called posts inside of the collection inside of the database i'm going to say on snapshot so this is super powerful right now on snapchat and we say snapshot basically this gives us back a snapshot of david so imagine we just took a picture of the database right so it's listening and anytime that data changes or deletes or anything it basically grabs the snapshot and gives it to you so this piece of code that i'm about to write fires off and here what we're doing is we're saying set the post so set the the variable inside of react so set this variable right here to the value inside of here so if i set this it'll be empty but we don't want it to use that we want to use the snapshot so the actual database documents so we're going to say go and get all the docs that came back in that snapshot and then map through it and say for every single dock map and get me the dock data so the dock data is all of those fields that kazi added so the display name the avatar the image the text all of that stuff and what this will do is this will give you an array of all of the posts inside of the database right so all of the data it will be basically bubbled up into an array we set that as our posts so in this case now so guys just to visually show you guys because i think this is the part which just gets the most confusing so first yep okay just think about it super simply collection posts here i'm accessing posts so this one line over this line over here gets me access to this guy here post okay then when i do snapshot docs.map and this dock over here it allows me to loop through each document so first i'm looping through this document then if i had another post it would allow me to loop through that post as well so imagine i had you know one more post there if i had a third post like maybe a post here by barack obama here i have a post by you know i don't know kim kardashian that doc will give you access to each of them okay and then the last part of this thing is the doc.data when you do data this will actually get you access to this entire object okay yeah so the data will contain all of those things so then later you can do things like um you know dot avatar and it'll get you this one or dot display name and you'll get access to this one so i think this one line is oftentimes the most confusing to most people but yeah basically what it's allowing you to do in simple terms is just get access to every single post and all of their data exactly so super important uh point then i think cardi explains it really well when he does that um so literally guys what that's doing is yeah it's mapping to our state inside of our app and that means that greatest ever is saying so people were asking hey is profit would react also inside of this guys so profit with javascript will contain a lot of react stuff in there too and we're going to keep on adding things even if they're not there right now that's our longterm vision with sunny and i that's why sunny joined the team so he can actually bring in a lot of react to clever programmer so yeah greatest ever so should one wait for them to be added because i really love react stuff but what i get in is that look we're gonna you first of all you need to learn the fundamentals of javascript before you just jump into react so we're gonna give you all the fundamentals of javascript and yes we're gonna be adding in a ton of react to that course because it's gonna still react it's just a javascript library yeah so we're gonna give you access to react basically just allows you to supercharge your javascript skills and everything you're doing with javascript so we're going to add that into the program as well and you still have live weekly coaching calls directly with sunny so yes you are going to be building react stuff the instant you join the program yeah so literally every single tuesday we pretty much i run a react coaching call so you're gonna get extremely um yeah you're gonna get extreme intense react sessions in those in those calls where it's a zoom call so what like literally you can ask me any questions you can jump in we run through demos we run through any sort of problems or we kind of go over like somebody just said use callback so if if those questions pop up we run through anything that needs to be sort of go through and it's super intense so it's really really good from the getgo definitely recommend you check it out yeah beautiful nice so we just populated posts from the database right so now rather than rendering it from uh like like how we've hardcoded it on 925 instead what i'm going to do is i'm going to say posts dot map i'm going to say for every single post that we go through i want to render a post component right but now what i'm going to be doing is i'm not going to be so imagine like we're pulling this component right so imagine we're doing this but instead of writing this like this i don't want to now basically oh oops that shouldn't be like that should be open bracket yeah so now i don't want to actually have it so that oh my god what happened here okay so there we go now instead of doing this i'm going to say uh post dot display name yeah display name and basically do this do do that for every single one but you could do this or actually we will do this i want your destructuring at this point because it will be a bit confusing do post dot username right and then here we do post.verified so this is basically getting the database values now so saying post.verified and then here post.text so post.text and then here post avatar post dot avatar and then here so post avatar and then here we say post dot image right so now if i save this so as soon as i save this guys if we did everything correct so cause let's go ahead and get our app on the right so as soon as i save this now it should be able to connect to the database pull that in now it should say yo it's pulling from firebase or whatever we change that to right so if i go ahead and save this so now it should refresh and we should be pulling this information from uh firebase now so let's hope it all goes well god damn da da da opposite of test driven development hey you don't need to do it when you're this jacked so i'm gonna just show you guys what's happening here this is pretty freaking insane so boom look at this guys all right step one our avatar is being pulled from the database our display name is being pulled from the database our username our text every single thing want me to prove it to you watch this i'm going to go over here change this to bunny banga instead hit that boom look at that realtime baby no refresh no nothing guys if you like that one i thought that was pretty freaking sick go ahead and smash that like button break it on your computer you don't need the left click button anyway [Laughter] nice exactly guys like realtime connection to the database uh yeah i just think that's amazing nick and guys there's so much that goes under the hood of that but it's literally like a few lines of code to get that working which just blows my mind every time this is amazing i've literally never watched a youtube live session for this long let's go let's go awesome below our cram says it's firebase free all of this stuff is free you only need to start putting a card on the account when you start doing things like cloud functions even then it's generate massively free [ __ ] sound yeah trump there's a lot of free stuff inside of there guys um yeah so and i actually stole all of the uh sort of like if i ever have a portfolio or something i actually host everything on firebase and then i'll actually have my portfolio on firebase so yeah definitely go ahead and use it um nice right so let's go ahead and check this out i just sent uh i just sent frank a message actually just right now so yeah we'll see if he sends me a text back but he joined us i shot him over a text i love when i see the blue you know because iphone so it makes me really happy nice but let's keep going nice awesome so what we're going to do now is actually connect that top tweet box where it says what's happening we're going to basically make it so that when we type in there and when we enter an optional image url and hit tweet it's going to go ahead and post a tweet and we're going to basically post it as rafikaze so we're going to assume that they signed in as him right yeah so so now we're done with the re so hold on we're done with add realtime database with firebase now what are we working on we are working on um posting a tweet at ability to post a tweet yeah post a tweet to the database yeah post a tweet nice okay i like it says yeah it's the first time i've glued to a live like this you guys rock appreciate that dude love the fact you've been here watching nice nice good i love that okay cool i've changed everything now we're back to coding yeah yep boom let's go so now what we're gonna do is we have um the right yes so the tweet box so we have some text inside of what's happening so that input field and we also have an input field where it says optional enter an image url so first thing we need to fix is create two pieces of state that keep track right so it's going to keep track of what the user is typing in so let's go ahead and handle the first one hey frank just responded back and he goes let's go so ready to crush it and react nice amazing dude see you guys like we get we literally see as soon as you join and we will talk to you jump on cause everything it's all one to one nice so we're gonna go ahead and create the piece of state now so here we say for the input i'm gonna go ahead and call it the input so let's just say uh tweet message right and it was a set tweet message tweet message and i'm gonna say you stay and initially this will be a blank value right so it'll be a blank string so i'm gonna go ahead and import this we don't freak out go ahead and do this nice and then i'm going to go ahead and connect it to the input field so what we need to do to connect is the greatest ever the greatest ever says the fact that we are not moving from our screens and feeling the need to is just a testament to how great this teaching is and this applies to all the amazing teachers on cp thank you prem prem sagar just donated five new zealand dollars and he goes sunny kazi love from auckland beautiful and he goes you guys are doing an amazing awesome job finally i'm confident and react after watching your clone series hey let's go i think it's time for my horns thank you dude and we are we love the fact you're more confident with it after watching our stuff that's awesome to hear yeah nice uh somebody just asked so rodin danny says why don't you use express express.js for backend guys did you see how much code we wrote to get that working it was like a few lines of code which is why we didn't use express like for a backend so this is a major reason of using firebase uh it's so powerful gives you a realtime functionality out of the box and it's just insane with how little code you write the functionality that you get so that's my answer to that yeah so now what we're going to do is we're going to map the value here so to that tweet message in the state but it's gonna be stuck now so if you cause if you go ahead and try and type in what's happening what happens when i try to type no nothing yep nothing right because what we're doing is we're mapping tweet message which is set to blank to that input field so what we need to do to get a map to get it reacting to your input is we say on change which basically fires off an event every time we type i'm going to say set the tweet message so i'm going to say set the tweet message every single time you type to become e.target.value which is basically what you type in right now if you try and type for me so let me go ahead and save it now if you try and type what happens hey let's go i can type my fifi and i can type fubar nice awesome so now what we're going to do is we're going to create another piece of state so i'm going to create another one to keep track of the image so i'm going to say tweet image tweet image there we go and for this one i'm going to go ahead and map it so i'm going to say value equals tweet image so tweet image right i'm going to say on change we need to do the same thing we can say on change oops unchange equals set tree image so set uh sorry e so it's going to be arrow function and it says set tweet image to be e dot target dot value right awesome nice now what we can do is because we've done that right and because everything is inside of a form when we hit enter the button type should be submit because we want this to be our submit button for a function and basically what we want to do is we need to add on click so basically when i submit or when i click that button what am i going to do i'm going to say here send tweet right so we're going to create a function called send tweet and here what i want to do is i want to say const send tweet and this is going to be an arrow function so it takes an event which because whenever you click a button it dispatches an event because we're inside of a form guys it's going to refresh the page right so in order to stop that because in react you don't want to do refreshes right so you need to do e dot prevent default and this will prevent so you need to pass e as a parameter so send tweet is being passed in the button on click and then what you need to do is say e dot prevent default massively impossible says you guys are crazy love you guys keep it up you're helping me making my dream projects thank you so so so much for making these projects students like me need you please don't stop keep going let's keep going bro let's keep going amazing nice so e dot prevent default stops to refresh right it stops to refresh which in react we hate right but how do we post in the database so this is actually going to be surprisingly a lot easier than you think right so what the way we do that is essentially all we need to do is go ahead and write the following so we say db so we need to import the db so i'm going to go ahead and import that first so i'm going to say import db from my local firebase so boom boom boom local firebase not the module local firebase and i'm gonna say db dot collection posts right i'm gonna say dot add right say dot add and then basically this is all you need you add an object and that object has the same shape that we did earlier so remember when we basically went ahead and we added um the object kazi basically did it inside the firebase interface right he went in and added display name username so when we do the same thing here we say display name equals in this case the display name we're going to hard code it to be raphe kazi right well let's go ahead and say yeah let's do rafflecard rafikaze says to rafee qazi nice and then we're going to say the username is going to be um there we go we can even open this up right here if you want to look at it yeah yeah so this is exactly essentially what we're doing right now right but programmatically and then we're going to say verify this we're going to assume that it's true so verify it is true right and then we're going to say the text in this case is not going to be like a hard code value it's going to be whatever we wrote inside the tweet message right which we mapped when we did the input field right whoa we just hit 1.5 k likes nice thank you guys yeah just broke 1500 likes right this second and uh also 22 000 playback so just wanted to come in and say thank you guys so much if you are enjoying this so far you want to help us get it out to even more people hit that thumbs up button and also subscribe to the channel because we're going to be bringing you this value every single day guys up coming next week we have things on the agenda like facebook clone twit uh linkedin clone and what was the other one i sent you sonny airbnb clone so yeah if you want to be notified of those things so literally when we drop them you want to get a notification oh i was looking at the wrong camera if you want to get a notification like this on your phone then make sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon next to it as well so turn on the bell notifications and as soon as we go live for airbnb clone or linkedin clone or facebook clone this upcoming week you will get that notification you click it and you just jump in exactly guys make sure you're subscribed make sure you hit that notification icon do not miss these sessions guys and if you do don't worry about it they're all they're all going to be up on youtube forever you guys can watch it take your time go through it the code's going to be a github link amir says people might think we're paid to say that these sessions are the best but that's not true consider the amount of knowledge you gain from these videos and it's all for free these guys are killing it thank you brother yeah we're going to keep going thank you very much nice so we added the text which came from the tweet message steve says what about a slack clone oh that's actually oh yeah you know a cyclone will be fun dude i'm done you could even learn electron electron js oh yeah that would be dope oh yeah oh yeah yeah maybe we'll do it one day yeah so for now we're going to use that clever programmer logo as the avatar so that's going to be hardcoded still we're going to keep that one as a hardcoded value so i'm going to go ahead and do this and then for the image right we're going to go ahead and use the tree image so if we left it blank it's going to be blank that's fine but if we didn't then it's going to go ahead and use this which is the tree image right so that's cool and now what will happen is and basically after you tend to send a tweet you actually want to erase the tweet the sending the tweet message box and the tweet image right you don't want to actually show like anything the sort of previous contents you had in that input file so i'm going to go ahead and do set tweet image and set tweet message to blank after that if you don't do that the image the input files aren't going to reset right nice so if i go ahead and click save now so click save like that now what we should see is uh because if we go ahead and type in what's happening so like let's go ahead and type something into what's happening so let's go this is a real test or something this is a no i'm going to say hold on this is audible nice and oh [ __ ] i posted it bro yeah it did it right let's go ahead and add another one but let's give it an image okay got it yeah so guys did you notice that that was real time right oh [ __ ] my bad we weren't we weren't showing it my bad my bad my bed i think we never showed anything sorry guys show the code change the scene okay sorry damn it i don't know how long i kept it like that i apologize you guys okay cool so this should be good now yeah this is all you coded right yeah yeah they could see this part when we did that oh right now it wasn't sharing extra screen okay so yeah so guys what we're doing here is what we did just to run through again we did dv dot collection post ad and then we're mapping to the objects and the ones to take note of here are tweet message and tweet image which are being mapped to the state which is our input fields and then we basically reset the fields to to sort of clear them right all right all right what if we just did that to just get the chat going um okay cool so this is good um i got pumped because i said this is audible and then it posted it right here but you know all right and now i'm gonna post the image so i just click this pop this image in right there and i'll hit tweet right wait is that is that the same image or is that a different one um let me take a look actually right now paste it in let's go ahead looks good to me let's show the screen let's twit tweet i mean nice you want a different one let's go ahead and do a different one but guys that worked i literally just popped in that is pretty sick that it worked to be honest that gets me hyped up bro that's that's nice all right you need uh we need a different one yeah all right i don't know if this is actually gonna work i think you can use jpeg or just anything jpeg should work or a gift will work i got it i got it all right guys so here's what your life is like after you learn javascript and join our course boom pop that in tweet hopefully it works hey let's go baby nice you know your boy coming in clutch that's dope dude awesome guys if you found that cool let us know in the comments smash the thumbs up button i think that's pretty dope like that's pretty cool man like that she just showed it yeah we just showed them yep yo we didn't actually show one thing so let's go right over here we didn't show them the actual fact that it added it to the database so yeah let's go ahead and do it so take a look at this you guys all these posts you take you see this one right over here this is actually here here it is in the database right there boom here's what your life is like and boom that's the text right there we got the freaking you know what i'm saying so that's freaking crazy that it's all being dynamically shown from a database that we added in front of your face exactly amazing and if you just go ahead and add a simple tweet kazi so like a just like a normal one without an image even and show them uh as it pops in so we'll show them as it pops in i see what you're saying i see what you're saying yeah i got you i got you as would say i got you all right here we go guys get ready boom and now on the left hand side you're gonna see it pop in keep your eyes locked in on the left hand side in the post column boom there it is now i'm gonna add in another one okay get ready hit enter boom right there okay nice and it's all the way at the bottom um as they say in my country garage right so like guys you can see here like you're literally getting a case of um it's pretty much uh it's the reason why it's shuffled if if any of you guys are wondering by the way it's because we haven't put in timestamps random zbr says yo boys i need to go right now i have a meeting i have followed along with most of the streams believe me this is life changing can't thank you guys enough bye and thank you for everything that is amazing thank you man nice thank you dude all right so we're going to give you guys two more treats quickly right one of them was we talked about react flip move so i'm going to go ahead and quickly and show you how to implement that and get a smooth list right so we're going to implement that and then we're going to deploy the app right so stick with us guys and we're going to be pretty much done very shortly right yeah so react flip move to install it is mpmi react flip move so we're going to go ahead and pull up the terminal and do so kazi is chuck in the terminal uh chuck it in the terminal here we go mpm i and then react flip move so that's right frank if you are having trouble joining slack don't worry just shoot me a text i'll help you out all right npm what flip move oh no i i had it in there the nvmi uh flip move react flip move that one there got it dope we installed that go check this out basically what i was doing for uh to get me going on coding uh facebook popped this up from a few years ago so i don't recommend this you guys but um this is you know i had to this is me ordering ton of red bulls i don't know bulletproof coffee and and just a crap ton of lucky jack like ex yeah black coffee and it's like triple shot or something like that so you know i was gonna try that actually the bulletproof coffee i never tried that that's how i used to freaking code you guys but you know not anymore now i'm on a good sleeping schedule i love that the greatest ever says sunny starts laughing at the memes before qazi uploads them just like me kazzy's crazy let's go bro no he said we can't see the code editor again i did it again what's wrong with me i'm so sorry damn all right guys all right all right all right all right i'll get better at it don't worry don't worry i got you i got you all right let's keep going right so all we did there guys was mpmi react flip move so we did this mpmi react flip move and we hit enter and that was it right so in order to basically let's go ahead and add um the react flip move so to do it i'm not going to explain too much of the implementation i'll let you guys go ahead and check out the documentation i'm just going to show you how you can pretty much chuck it inside of this so we want it basically on every post so we want all the posts to be animated right so in order to do that what we need is we need to go to the post itself i'm going to change this to a functional com uh to not not a functional one an es6 function so it's like this right and then what i'm going to go ahead and do i don't know why that's freaking out that's not wrong um let's go ahead and do this yeah and then what i need to do is import forward ref so forward ref is a way of handling references in react so again don't really need to know exactly what that is at this point if you want to go ahead and check out the react docs but how do we use it right we basically go here before the the props and we basically do the following right we write forward ref put another parenthesis so another bracket go all the way down to the bottom what is this for what are we doing what's the point of this we're setting up react flip move oh i see okay do people know what react flip move is i don't think so right so before so yeah so we showed the other uh the sort of slide at the beginning but it might be worth showing them yeah so if we go ahead and open this react flip oh yeah i got you here we go guys here's react flip move boom and voila here we go hey so this is what we're gonna what we're building right now yep so it gives you like a very nice smooth animation right yeah um awesome so with that said now what we're gonna do is we're basically gonna do we put the forward reference so we've done it there added the parentheses here and then all the way at the bottom down here to sort of close everything off so that's nice and now what i'm going to do is go ahead and do the following so i'm going to go ahead and say this actually what we need to do is where we have our props over here need to add print parentheses here and i need to go ahead and do this jj asks do you have any plans to use typescript would react in any future tutorials i think the answer to that is hell yeah right yeah definitely yeah guys we're all i actually code yeah you code and typescript right yeah yeah all about that hype script life you guys so we're going to be doing a lot of that soon exactly so guys uh we pretty much here were the props and what i did is i added this this second parameter when we added forward ref because we gives us something called a ref right and all we need to do here is go ahead and do this we say ref equals that ref right that's it right that's for the first part that's the first part we need to do right and then what we do so that's for the post the individual posts right now where we actually animate the posts so where we have multiple posts being shown on the screen is inside of the feed right it's inside the feed and the way we do it now in here is we basically go ahead and import flip move from a react flip move at the top like this and then what we need to do is basically wrap the the mapping inside of the that flip move so we need to go ahead and do the following so this so now you can see that we've essentially wrapped our posts inside of flip move but in order to get this to work correctly we need to give it a key right now a key in this case has to be something unique in this case the key that we're going to use isn't the best key to use but it will work for this case we're going to say the key is the post text right because in this case we haven't got any text with the same thing but in this case what you should be doing is pulling the document id from firebase and using that as your key but in this case to save time we're basically just going to use the post text as your id and then what i'm going to go ahead and do is save and now kazi if you actually let me go and save this so if you go ahead and open up localhost and maybe refresh it okay yeah give me one second i'm gonna just go ahead and uh do that right here and uh open this up and refresh it all right what are we looking for if you type in like add a post now whoops test clean boy let me check on my local hostess out because i couldn't see it properly but that looks like it's adding it in random places you know so we won't sometimes see that's because of the timestamp yeah i'm going to do it for my machine guys i'm going to say hey there i saw from your machine yeah i saw sunny in the house damn nice awesome right so with that said guys we pretty much showed you how to add a animation library which is so dope and it works really really nice and clean um awesome so yeah so that pretty much has an animation make sure when you are using a key guys use the firebase doc.id which will you get at this point just to show you guys uh because i don't want to sort of mislead anyone with it with the key information so here what you would do is when you have doctor data you can pretty much at this point pull out doctor id as well right so you can do something like doctor id and that's the that's the key that you want to use which gives you a unique id from firebase so in case you're wondering that's the one that you're going to use um awesome so i think with that said qazi we're ready to actually go ahead and deploy so guys if you're excited let us know in the comments uh we're going to show you right now how to go ahead and deploy this app we're going to be deploying this [ __ ] real soon guys so get pumped all right this is my favorite if you haven't already guys hit the thumbs up button if you're enjoying this you know people are like freaking uh getting they were like getting annoyed by how many times he was saying are you pumped the top comment [Laughter] it's like enough of the dj [ __ ] vibes yeah oh man i can't wait to see uh you know i don't even tell nas i want to tell him i want to show him those comments when we're all there at once and show him that he got like 50 likes and then just see his like reactions like face drop he's like can we stop with the over energetic dj someone said wave it [Laughter] oh man people are brutal man all right um i mean we've all had a roasting i had a roast on one of the live sessions like your wife sonny so fat and why is he always wearing this black shirt it's like he's like steve jobs but he just wears a black shirt instead of her yeah people would always make fun of my like teeth they're like your teeth are like [ __ ] up and i'm like well you know i don't know man i don't know what to do about that i'm trying over here i'm trying my best yeah um all right all right time to deploy yeah let's do it so inside the terminal guys is where we did so we don't actually need to do anything on firebase yeah yeah i forget that sometimes you know but okay so guys it's pretty simple we're gonna do firebase in it right yep and then um we're just gonna sit here and wait and then we're gonna look over here pretty soon it's gonna ask us some questions in a second let's go down to hosting you guys because we don't need to do any other stuff right hit hosting we're going to hit use an existing project and then boom we're going to go to this is our what clone twitter clone so let's find twitter clone boom so let's click that now for this make sure you guys say build because that's a folder things go into so for those of you guys who might have trouble seeing right now uh i'm gonna just write it out on the screen so just write build here that's it i'm going to hit enter it's a single page application so say yes don't say no type in y and hit enter so now this build folder should be made for you guys and that's looking good so sunny at this point what do we do with that do we do firebase uh do we do npm yeah build yeah so we do npm and also guys before you do that when you did firebase and net you might be prompted to log in all you need to do is do firebase login if that happens and then it'll pop up on chrome all right so that's just in case anyone runs into that um but yeah now we need to do npm run build and what this will do is so let's go ahead and run that command um qazi i love that uh as soon as i said that frankie dropped in the chat and he's like are you guys pumped when we were talking about the gnostic npm run build right yeah mpm all right and what this does guys is it strips out all the developer rubbish pretty much gets everything super optimal right so it basically creates like a super lightweight build of the app everything that's gonna be online is in this folder okay this is what's gonna be actually online yeah important point here guys if you make any changes after you do npm run build you have to do npm rom build again to get the latest build before you do a deployment hold on sonny you better stop talking boy because we got some fire what why did he get hit and hold on i have to do this one again here we go so sergeant says yo what's up guys just landed a two thousand dollar a month client during this call thanks to you guys teaching me react.js nice are you guys pumping drop it in the comments like drop in the comments below if you guys are pumped sorry man what are you gonna say i was just gonna say we speak to sergeant quite a lot on uh on instagram because he actually posts stories quite a lot and he tags us in there and if you guys haven't already like shoot us uh an instagram story and tag me and kazi our tags are on the bottom of the screen i think you have to switch the screen kazi what do you mean basically yeah my bad for the instagram tags yeah so at the bottom of the screen right here guys just shoot an instagram story tag myself and kakazi uh using the handles over here and pretty much yeah we can get chatting with you guys but that's insane dude i love to see that yeah and like so take a look at this you guys so sajin has been in our community and he's been sending like instagram messages so he's like appreciate and love all of what you guys are doing what you're offering is incredible and this message was on what july 8th so today is august 7th so like look we've been talking to um for like over a month he like sent video messages i responded to them and you know since then he's been working at it building these clones and a month later he just landed a 2 000 a month client so that is freaking sick exactly insane insane yep well done dude right so we just done npm run build which basically bundled the app up into this performance bundle right so it's like everything that we need to deploy now is inside of that build photo you'd never touch it you don't need to touch it what's happening check out frank just made a story which is freaking sick so check this out hold on i'm gonna play it from the start for you guys so this is frank's story you guys he joined prophet javascript as well and he says making twitter in react and then here's this 25 baller ass donation thanks so much for that and he actually joined the prophet javascript course as well so i'm gonna just make his story my story and we will do that for you guys as well if you reach out yeah amazing love that thank you so much frank for joining and awesome work sergeant for landing that client amazing stuff right um nice so i guess at this point if you guys are excited let us know in the comments we're about to hit the deployment phase right we're about to hit one command which is going to send this app into fly firebase that's fair yeah it's going to send this onto the internet and you guys can pretty much go ahead and check this out all right are you guys ready or what if you're excited to use this app right here right now while you're on the stream an epic conclusion to everything that you and i and sunny have done together all of you beautiful people in the chat like future code and henrik and saeed and steve if you're excited about this drop in the comments below guys we're gonna launch this app live in five four three three two two one and this thing is about to go live guys so just give it a second and as soon as that's done boom it's there let's see here's the link yep boom and i'm gonna full screen this paste the link if this is good to go i'm going to drop the link in the chat link in the chat has been dropped so you guys are now welcome to jump on this app and use it there we go you guys here is the link to it so this is this app is actually up and running nice amazing go ahead and check it out guys go ahead and play with it you guys can see it for yourself know that we weren't just coding a bunch of lies the whole time you guys can actually go and play with this it will be posting as rafikaze so we can see a bunch of people actually typing messages in nice hi guys yup hi guys yep people typing in messages so yeah everything's gonna be coming from rafikaze here you guys awesome this is nice okay dope so sunny we have built this app and we have completed it hopefully you guys have enjoyed it i know i see frank says let's deploy it programmer machine says programmer gods youtube byron says amazing awesome thank you guys for all the love hendrix says go go go savannah says ready with that said guys we have done a lot of things and just to kind of recap everything that we did today you guys i'm going to do a quick recap so we built a react twitter clone all right we use technologies like react.js material ui css and firebase this is what you guys built today material ui was used for all the icons all right real time firestore database was used for the comments and the post that we made you guys learned how to use css variables and suddenly you use them for twitter color right yeah we use it for the twitter color and also a background color so css variables are used yeah and then to add those nice slick animations you guys use react flip move and this is what created those dynamic animations when you're posting the tweets so so so juicy and so nice and then at the end what did we do sonny we sent the app straight into the firebase line now it's deployed and live for you guys to mess around with play with and just you know see have a have a play and feel before you go ahead and build it and also guys code is in the github repo that we have actually gone ahead and put in the description and we made a few changes live on the session so i will go ahead and push those changes also to the github repo so you guys have everything fresh and like you saw it on the uh on the the feed today yep beautiful you guys so thank you so much with that said do we have anything else to add sunny just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who is watching we appreciate you guys and we love that you guys turn up every single day and yeah like we said if you guys haven't already shoot us an instagram message um and we can get chatting to you guys uh with that said i think i'm pretty pretty good oh yeah and also join the free training guys the link is in the description quasi why should they join this so this training you guys you know the main thing is you want to go from that practicality of like how can i take my coding and then make a living with it so the number one thing like sudjan commented just a little bit earlier and he said i just landed a 2 000 a month client that's practicality everything else i think is cute and awesome that you're learning but how can you actually now make a living with it how can you support your family with it i think those are by far the most important questions to be asking and so in this training we give you the answers to a lot

and sign up for this exclusive training that's it that's it yeah make sure you guys do i mean it's free training guys like if you're if you were here during this session like definitely go check it out like you literally just going to come out of it as a better javascript developer yep sergeant says all right here's something such and says so sudjan message and he says freaking appreciate you guys from all the app clone trainings to the roadmap trainings plus pwj oh he's also our profit of javascript student right gave me everything i needed to pick up being a developer uh to pick up developer work fast that is awesome nice pumpfree amazing i'm really really proud of you man that's awesome there yeah and if you guys want you know just go ahead and you guys can jump into our program profit with javascript which we have mentioned the link is in the description below but again you know if you're ready to just kind of jump straight into it you're going to get weekly trainings you're going to learn how to make an income with javascript which i think is huge and one of the best things with it that i want to show you guys actually is the fact that you actually get an amazing community of people that come with it so you know here is actually sudjan right here who actually joined and he just landed a 2 000 a month client and here is the rest of the community and we have over 1400 amazing members that are a part of this so yeah sergeant just dropped a really crazy comment i said this one client guys returned everything he paid for in pwj so worth every single penny oh damn where did you drop that he dropped that on a comment just now oh i see that is awesome let me actually share that because that's super dope so yep he's like this one client returned everything i paid so yeah guys i mean if you're getting work as a developer i mean whatever you pay for this program is going to be pennies you know oftentimes what people do is there's a saying tripping over dollars to pick up pennies and that's what people often do so they're like hey i don't want to join this program or some other program because it's too much money that i have to invest but then they keep trying to like through failure trial and error figure out their own way and that costs you something you can't ever get back that costs you time time is the most expensive price you can pay and they say that broke people are cheap with their money and rich people are actually cheap with their time so instead of being cheap with your money i think it's a lot better if you're cheap with your time meaning invest money up front so you don't have to make those mistakes and you can learn like sudjan get those clients exactly you heard it guys you saw it firsthand proof that somebody's actually made a huge amount more than they even paid for the course like definitely go and check it out yeah jen last week that we shared with you guys got a job offer for 96 000 a year so she's also part of this community right here and guys interesting story with jen she lost her job due to coved right so she actually lost her job and then she about i think it was like a week or two later landed a job which paid double her salary yeah which was just insane like that's a boss move like that's that's insane and she did that through profitable javascript and this girl she picked up
