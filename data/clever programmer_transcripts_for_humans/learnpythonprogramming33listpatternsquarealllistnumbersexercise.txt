00:00 - back so here's another cool patterns
00:02 - pattern using the list that I want to
00:04 - share with you so let's say we have a
00:07 - list of numbers okay and what we want to
00:09 - get back effectively is something that
00:11 - squares it so the result should look
00:13 - like one squared so that's just one two
00:16 - squared that's four this 3 over here
00:19 - squared that's just 9 that 4 over there
00:22 - squared that's 16 5 squared is 25 6
00:25 - squared is 36 and I think you get the
00:27 - idea so we can we would want to call
00:31 - that list the squared list or we can say
00:35 - squared numbers right since this list is
00:39 - called numbers so how do we do that how
00:43 - do we turn this list into just all of
00:46 - these numbers squared let's figure it
00:49 - out
00:50 - one way you would do it is you could
00:52 - type it out manually but that's gonna be
00:54 - a lot of work right that would mean that
00:55 - you would do squared numbers dot append
00:59 - append is a method that allows you to
01:02 - add to the list so here we have an empty
01:04 - list and since we want to add something
01:06 - to it let's just let's just show you
01:07 - what I mean okay
01:08 - let's say we want to add a banana in
01:10 - there okay and let's print out squared
01:13 - numbers when I run it you can see that
01:16 - I've now added a banana let's let's
01:18 - throw something else in there okay let's
01:20 - throw Apple okay let's run through it
01:23 - and you can see now banana and Apple are
01:25 - at it okay so pen just simply add
01:27 - something to the end of the list hence
01:29 - append okay so going back here what we
01:35 - want to do is we want to essentially
01:36 - append each of those numbers squares so
01:40 - how can we do that well we leverage off
01:42 - what we learned in our last video so we
01:44 - do for a number in numbers this is now
01:47 - going to give us numbers gonna be one
01:49 - the first time to the next time three
01:50 - the third time and so on and so forth
01:53 - and what do we want to do we want to do
01:55 - squared numbers dot append number and so
02:00 - we're appending now the number so we're
02:02 - gonna basically every time we go through
02:03 - the loop we add one the first time then
02:05 - we add two from this list and we add
02:08 - three but we want to actually add the
02:10 - squares of those numbers so we want to
02:12 - do this
02:13 - and now let's check out what square
02:16 - numbers looks like and that's it okay as
02:22 - simple as that
02:22 - very good pattern remember and and it
02:27 - works okay
02:28 - so play around with it see if you can do
02:30 - something like cubing it or change up
02:34 - this list and see if you can do
02:35 - something like dividing it into every
02:38 - single time and then appending that so
02:40 - you can call it like half numbers yeah
02:43 - practice it out run this code I'm going
02:46 - to add the link of this in the below the
02:49 - video or above the video so you guys can
02:51 - actually go directly here and play
02:52 - around with this alright guys thanks for
02:54 - watching I'll see you in the next video

back so here's another cool patterns pattern using the list that I want to share with you so let's say we have a list of numbers okay and what we want to get back effectively is something that squares it so the result should look like one squared so that's just one two squared that's four this 3 over here squared that's just 9 that 4 over there squared that's 16 5 squared is 25 6 squared is 36 and I think you get the idea so we can we would want to call that list the squared list or we can say squared numbers right since this list is called numbers so how do we do that how do we turn this list into just all of these numbers squared let's figure it out one way you would do it is you could type it out manually but that's gonna be a lot of work right that would mean that you would do squared numbers dot append append is a method that allows you to add to the list so here we have an empty list and since we want to add something to it let's just let's just show you what I mean okay let's say we want to add a banana in there okay and let's print out squared numbers when I run it you can see that I've now added a banana let's let's throw something else in there okay let's throw Apple okay let's run through it and you can see now banana and Apple are at it okay so pen just simply add something to the end of the list hence append okay so going back here what we want to do is we want to essentially append each of those numbers squares so how can we do that well we leverage off what we learned in our last video so we do for a number in numbers this is now going to give us numbers gonna be one the first time to the next time three the third time and so on and so forth and what do we want to do we want to do squared numbers dot append number and so we're appending now the number so we're gonna basically every time we go through the loop we add one the first time then we add two from this list and we add three but we want to actually add the squares of those numbers so we want to do this and now let's check out what square numbers looks like and that's it okay as simple as that very good pattern remember and and it works okay so play around with it see if you can do something like cubing it or change up this list and see if you can do something like dividing it into every single time and then appending that so you can call it like half numbers yeah practice it out run this code I'm going to add the link of this in the below the video or above the video so you guys can actually go directly here and play around with this alright guys thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video
