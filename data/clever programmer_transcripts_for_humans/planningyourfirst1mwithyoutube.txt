05:07 - more than this
05:08 - okay cool so let me hit
05:12 - stop sharing and now let's go over what
05:14 - it looks like
05:16 - to actually have a plan where you can be
05:18 - on track to make a million dollars are
05:20 - you guys interested in seeing that
05:24 - yes of course okay okay
05:28 - so there are multiple ways yesterday we
05:31 - talked about it guys and we talked about
05:33 - that there are a lot of different ways
05:35 - you can make money from
05:37 - youtube um do any of you guys remember
05:40 - what those ways were if you remember you
05:43 - could just say them out loud
05:46 - of course
05:48 - [Music]
05:50 - brand your brand yourself make a course
05:52 - brand yourself make a course
05:54 - awesome i love that olivia already got
05:56 - her mind on that i like it
06:00 - views views so like ads youtube paying
06:03 - you cool
06:05 - what else collaborations with others
06:07 - collaboration
06:08 - awesome what else
06:12 - so super chats super chats yep
06:15 - transactions
06:15 - so there's tons of different ways right
06:17 - like we already listed them out
06:19 - yesterday you guys listed out you guys
06:20 - were like affiliate marketing
06:22 - sponsorships youtube ad revenue
06:26 - you know um super chats
06:29 - transactions like the people paying you
06:30 - donations t-shirts
06:32 - merch there's so many different ways
06:35 - there's no really limit to it
06:36 - i could show you a thousand different
06:39 - ways people became millionaires with
06:40 - youtube
06:41 - but i want to start to now show you guys
06:43 - how i did it
06:45 - and maybe it would bring some value to
06:47 - you guys okay
06:48 - so for me when it came to youtube
06:52 - was how can i bring value to a lot of
06:55 - people
06:56 - and i knew that if i could bring a lot
06:58 - of value to people at scale
07:00 - then i could make money at scale right
07:03 - so if you sit and have a one-on-one
07:05 - session with somebody and they pay you
07:07 - how many people have you helped in a
07:10 - one-on-one session
07:11 - and you sit with somebody and help them
07:13 - how many people have you helped
07:14 - just one person right so if you're
07:17 - helping only one person
07:19 - you're collecting one payment yes
07:23 - now yes what if in one sitting
07:27 - you had a group of five people like
07:29 - sitting right in front of you like
07:30 - physically and you were helping all five
07:32 - of them
07:33 - and you helped all five of them and they
07:35 - all five
07:36 - then pay you right so you've helped how
07:38 - many people
07:40 - five five five and you got paid how many
07:43 - times
07:44 - five times five times right and
07:47 - you did it all in the same single one
07:50 - hour
07:51 - does that make sense yeah yes yes
07:54 - so same thing if you i'm to make a
07:57 - monitor co-host as well so give me one
07:58 - second
07:59 - boom there we go so same thing will
08:02 - happen
08:02 - if you do whether you help one person at
08:05 - one time or you help five people at five
08:07 - time then you just
08:09 - are able to make five times the income
08:10 - because you help five times the people
08:12 - cool so that's kind of what happened
08:15 - with you know clever programmer where i
08:18 - found a way to essentially help more
08:20 - people
08:20 - and when you're on youtube and you're
08:22 - making content you can help more people
08:25 - at one time
08:26 - whether it's 10 people or 20 people
08:29 - or 100 people so then does it make sense
08:33 - to you guys that if you helped 100
08:35 - people
08:35 - it's possible you could get paid
08:39 - two times more than what you make right
08:41 - now or maybe three times more than what
08:43 - you make right now
08:44 - is that possible yeah raise your hands
08:47 - if that's
08:47 - yes
08:51 - so absolutely absolutely love it so if
08:54 - that's possible
08:55 - then the question becomes well why don't
08:57 - we do it
09:01 - why don't we oh i'm doing it now stacy's
09:04 - doing it
09:05 - i know olivia's doing it i know some of
09:06 - you are on youtube doing it
09:08 - so why don't we do it maybe lack of
09:11 - self-confidence
09:12 - that we can bring value yep
09:15 - that i think that hits the nail on the
09:17 - head um
09:18 - and why do people think that like what
09:20 - for example um and
09:22 - uh just tell me if i'm saying your name
09:24 - wrong is it rocio
09:26 - that's correct okay so rocio like what
09:28 - is it for you
09:29 - that makes you feel that where you feel
09:31 - that maybe you're not bringing value to
09:33 - people
09:35 - um i guess you live in a world where
09:37 - we're kind of wanting immediate feedback
09:39 - um rather than just doing something
09:42 - stepping back
09:43 - and allowing it to be we're constantly
09:45 - checking the analytics
09:47 - and we're like trying to say oh well we
09:49 - don't have views so we must not be good
09:51 - enough
09:52 - yes what she just said guys
09:56 - was that valuable at all to any of you
09:59 - and she won't take offense if you don't
10:00 - raise your hands if you but if you
10:02 - thought it was valuable
10:03 - truly thought it was even though one
10:05 - little nugget raise your hands or just
10:06 - say yes out loud
10:07 - yes yes yes thanks
10:10 - right yes yes yes so here's the thing
10:14 - this is immediate feedback for you
10:16 - because we have a community
10:18 - that is like very positive and that's
10:19 - right here
10:21 - when you're doing it alone you don't
10:22 - hear that all the time
10:25 - right so if you are looking for it then
10:28 - what you said is true
10:29 - you won't really get it
10:32 - but what you want to share if it's your
10:35 - internal truth
10:36 - just know that there are people that are
10:38 - going to find this valuable there are
10:40 - people out there who's
10:41 - actually listening to you and care about
10:43 - what you have to say
10:47 - so that part is you know this is one of
10:50 - the reasons why
10:51 - a lot of people don't actually do it and
10:53 - don't go through it because
10:55 - i think for a lot of people it's very
10:56 - clear they get i think people
10:58 - theoretically understand if you do
11:00 - youtube
11:01 - you know a lot of us know so many people
11:02 - that have become millionaires so a lot
11:04 - of us are like oh this is a very
11:05 - possible route
11:06 - right but then we actually don't end up
11:08 - doing it and most of the times that's
11:09 - because
11:10 - we are blocking ourselves mentally or
11:12 - we're thinking that we don't bring
11:14 - enough value or we're thinking
11:15 - this that or the other thing so the
11:18 - important part is like
11:20 - how can we get that out of our head how
11:22 - can we have that mindset shift where
11:26 - we're not just addicted to that
11:28 - validation because you won't get it
11:30 - that's the problem behind
11:31 - it the validation you're looking for you
11:33 - might start getting it when you get 10
11:35 - 000 subscribers or 50 000 subscribers
11:38 - but if you're looking for it today when
11:39 - you have zero subscribers
11:41 - you're not gonna get it right you're not
11:43 - gonna always have these people
11:45 - who are there so understand that even
11:48 - your guys's world view
11:49 - or a perspective can actually bring
11:52 - value
11:53 - even you just sharing your insight can
11:56 - bring value
11:57 - how many of you people here have one
12:00 - or more friends raise your hand if you
12:02 - have one or more friends
12:05 - okay why are those friends
12:09 - there with you why
12:13 - help you personality things in common
12:17 - personality things in common they add
12:19 - value to my life
12:20 - add value to your life cool because of
12:22 - my nature we do
12:25 - because of your nature what else
12:30 - so if you have if you have these friends
12:32 - next to you
12:34 - and they're there are they there because
12:36 - they are they want your money i mean
12:39 - some of them might want free food
12:40 - sometimes but
12:43 - right like it's not because they want
12:44 - your money it's not because they need
12:46 - something from you i think friendships
12:47 - are is one of the most people
12:49 - loyalty right friendships is one of the
12:51 - most pure relationships you can have
12:55 - because they don't even need anything
12:57 - from you they're not dependent on you in
12:58 - any way they're still
12:59 - there so if you have one friend
13:04 - or more friends then i believe it's
13:06 - possible for you
13:07 - that there might be some other people
13:09 - out there
13:10 - do you guys believe there might be some
13:12 - other people out there that are like you
13:14 - or your friends out of the six or seven
13:15 - billion people that exist on this planet
13:19 - yes for sure
13:22 - so then that's your tribe right
13:26 - and take yourself and take your best
13:28 - friend
13:29 - and multiply that that's your tribe
13:33 - so it's very exciting like what's
13:35 - actually out there and what's possible
13:38 - even this setting here is my dream like
13:40 - literally
13:41 - i think about it yesterday and i'm
13:43 - thinking holy crap we were only supposed
13:45 - to do an hour and a half
13:46 - of the challenge and we went for like
13:48 - four hours and i could have gone
13:50 - for far more and i was like loving it
13:52 - right
13:53 - and like the energy was amazing
13:55 - everybody was here and like everybody
13:56 - was engaged
13:58 - so it's a tribe of people
14:02 - i'm putting my stuff out there and then
14:04 - the people who connect come to it it's
14:05 - kind of
14:06 - really beautiful it's like finding
14:08 - friends online
14:09 - and i feel like youtube is like the best
14:11 - way to do that and then imagine
14:13 - imagine if your best friend started
14:15 - hanging out with you
14:16 - and imagine if your best friend started
14:19 - paying you to hang out with you
14:22 - and then imagine all your friends that
14:23 - hang out with you started paying you to
14:25 - hang out with you
14:29 - that's pretty crazy life that's kind of
14:32 - awesome you're like
14:33 - wow like not only am now i don't even
14:35 - have to spend time doing this job i
14:37 - don't like i can
14:38 - literally just hang out with the people
14:40 - i love and care about
14:43 - how many of you guys would like to hang
14:44 - out with your friends and get paid for
14:46 - it
14:49 - almost everybody right it's a fun
14:52 - place to be at it's a place where you're
14:54 - cared for you're loved you're
14:56 - appreciated
14:56 - so that's what i want you to take out of
14:58 - it that that's actually
15:00 - possible for you that's possible for a
15:02 - lot of people now
15:04 - is everybody going to make a million
15:05 - dollars probably not but not everybody
15:07 - wants to make a million dollars to be
15:09 - happy right a lot of you
15:11 - want to make different amounts of like
15:13 - some of you might be so ambitious here
15:14 - you're like i want to make 10 million
15:16 - dollars
15:17 - some of you might be like hey if i make
15:18 - 50 000 i'll be happy some of you might
15:21 - be like if i make 10 000 extra i'll be
15:22 - happy
15:23 - so right now when i ask you what's your
15:25 - number just on the count of three i want
15:27 - you to spit out what's your number that
15:29 - that will make you happy okay so here's
15:32 - how it's gonna go
15:33 - i'm gonna count to three and then i want
15:34 - you to just say whatever your number is
15:36 - thirty thousand thirty million whatever
15:38 - it is okay so one
15:40 - two three
15:49 - did you guys hear that the answers were
15:51 - just all over the place
15:53 - yeah that's what it is but whatever
15:56 - but whatever if somebody said a billion
15:59 - or a trillion
16:00 - that's that's what gets them happiness
16:04 - right maybe that doesn't get you
16:06 - happiness so that's an important
16:08 - conversation to have and think about
16:10 - like
16:10 - what is the number that you will like
16:13 - that's enough
16:14 - and you'll enjoy and you'll be happy
16:16 - with right so that's why it's important
16:18 - and you guys heard everybody has a
16:19 - different number
16:20 - and i can't force you to think a certain
16:22 - way not anybody else can force you to
16:24 - think a certain way
16:25 - it's also called like a financial
16:27 - thermostat where is it at for you
16:30 - right and if you said a billion are you
16:31 - working like a bill are you working
16:33 - hard like you want a billion and if
16:35 - you're not then you don't want a billion
16:37 - that's the conversation i had with frank

17:40 - different number in mind but what i
17:42 - realized is at some point i gave up the
17:44 - number game because
17:45 - it becomes really pointless because
17:47 - there came a point where i had
17:48 - all the money i needed to run away from
17:50 - everything i hated
17:52 - like at first i thought i just wanted
17:54 - like some insane amount of money right
17:57 - and what i started what i realized is i
17:59 - didn't even know until
18:00 - 2019 to 2020 i didn't even know like
18:05 - what you need to do to actually just be
18:08 - um i didn't i didn't know how to run
18:10 - away run towards happiness
18:12 - i didn't know how to run towards a goal
18:15 - the only thing i knew that i actually
18:17 - built the business off of was like
18:19 - i didn't like that i had to be
18:21 - financially dependent on anybody else
18:24 - i didn't like that i couldn't afford or
18:26 - help my parents go to the doctors
18:29 - and it that's they needed that a lot i
18:31 - didn't like that
18:32 - my friend just started like literally a
18:34 - week before me and then ended up making
18:37 - way more money than me freelancing i was
18:38 - like [ __ ] that like i've been doing it
18:40 - for years
18:41 - so there was a lot of pain that caused
18:44 - me to
18:45 - run towards and like grow my channel
18:47 - grow my brand in the start
18:49 - but then i realized 2018 i became really
18:53 - like in a weird way
18:54 - unhappy because i felt that i got
18:56 - everything i wanted i'm like
18:58 - i've beat everybody that was like once
19:00 - my mentor
19:02 - i have gotten more money than i don't
19:04 - know i know what to do with i'm
19:06 - traveling everywhere i'm in the heart of
19:08 - hollywood i
19:10 - i have my friends with me i'm dating
19:12 - whatever i want like
19:13 - crazy but what i realized was i was not
19:16 - happy
19:17 - like i didn't have a vision to run
19:19 - towards
19:20 - but i had run away from everything i
19:22 - didn't want it does that kind of make
19:23 - sense with you guys
19:25 - like so ran away from my pain yes money
19:27 - doesn't bring happiness
19:29 - yes but i also want to be careful about
19:32 - phrases like that too because
19:33 - sometimes we end up thinking and i know
19:36 - you don't think this olivia
19:37 - but for some people they start thinking
19:39 - like oh money is the root of evil or
19:41 - phrases like this can quickly make it
19:43 - like that where it's
19:44 - quite the opposite i think people who
19:46 - have money on average are actually
19:48 - some of the most generous and kind
19:50 - people just the other day we were
19:52 - celebrating something and we got so
19:54 - excited at this
19:55 - restaurant and my friends started
19:56 - screaming because it was one of the
19:58 - biggest things we had ever done
20:00 - and um we were like going crazy right we
20:03 - closed this like
20:04 - deal it was huge it was like a 80
20:06 - thousand dollar deal
20:08 - going nuts and this like this group of
20:11 - ladies
20:12 - like about eight or ten of them sitting
20:13 - on the table and i told my friend i'm
20:16 - like dude he he didn't even like
20:17 - scream out of excitement it almost
20:19 - sounded like a scream out of panic
20:20 - because
20:21 - we didn't know we're gonna close the
20:22 - deal and he's like oh
20:25 - and i was like dude what happened are
20:26 - you okay and like my other friend was
20:28 - like dude are you okay
20:29 - and he's like yeah i'm fine it was
20:32 - frankie frankie sitting right here um
20:34 - and he's like yeah i'm fine i'm like
20:35 - what happened look at this and i was
20:37 - like oh
20:38 - and then we're trying to keep it low
20:40 - because we're at a restaurant and this
20:41 - group of eight or ten ladies you're like
20:43 - oh what happened tell us what happened
20:46 - they're like screaming
20:47 - and we're like we just closed the
20:48 - biggest deal ever we're so excited
20:50 - and they're and they're like all right
20:52 - champagne's on us and they just order us
20:54 - all champagne and sent it over
20:56 - and i was like wow that is so [ __ ]
20:59 - amazing because
21:01 - i know that if i was not here
21:04 - i don't know if anybody would be happy
21:06 - i've had people yell at me like get out
21:08 - of here look go away
21:10 - so i'm like wow these rich people are
21:12 - nice
21:13 - so for me you know it's like i think
21:16 - it's just
21:17 - it's a balance but but
21:21 - even with that said i knew how to run
21:23 - away from everything i didn't want i
21:24 - didn't know how to run
21:25 - towards so running towards something is
21:27 - really really
21:28 - important um at some point it's kind of
21:31 - what you have to do otherwise
21:32 - you you just kind of go around in
21:35 - circles in life and not really get
21:36 - anywhere
21:37 - so uh now the more tactical part
21:41 - that some of you guys are like okay you
21:43 - know this is this is cool
21:44 - i'm enjoying this but let's get to a
21:47 - little bit of the tactical part
21:48 - cool is that cool with you guys we might
21:50 - get a little bit technical and [ __ ] but
21:51 - i want you guys to stay in there
21:53 - and then we're going to come back to
21:54 - everything all right and then plus we
21:56 - got the roast at the end
21:58 - so um
22:01 - um cool so let's let's go ahead and do
22:04 - that

23:00 - and this is 2020 okay now
23:03 - it takes a lot of work and
23:06 - a lot of time but frankie when when did
23:08 - we break the first million like the
23:10 - total
23:11 - that video that we have where we went
23:13 - nuts
23:17 - 2019. okay so i'll show you guys
23:21 - let me see if i can actually find that
23:23 - what the [ __ ]
23:24 - man there's some new chrome update and
23:26 - it just keeps crashing chrome i i
23:28 - really really hate it my chrome has
23:32 - never crashed more times what's up
23:36 - uh oh yeah yeah yeah it's right here
23:41 - but you know what that's fine i don't
23:43 - need these pages
23:44 - all right so let me go here actually and
23:46 - i might have this moment
23:48 - saved so let's go back
23:54 - oh [ __ ] okay guys get ready this is
23:58 - one of the best moments of my entire
23:59 - life
24:01 - this is what it feels like to make a
24:02 - million
24:08 - [Applause]
24:14 - so that happens and then after that
24:18 - there's not much more i mean
24:21 - so that's that was our moment
24:24 - of when we hit that number and it was
24:27 - august
24:28 - 15 2019
24:31 - that was the exact day i believe that we
24:34 - hit that number so
24:36 - middle of so right here this is it
24:41 - okay um that's when it happened did it
24:45 - explode some of your guys's ears that
24:47 - was a really loud scream
24:49 - you guys okay everybody doing fine hey
24:52 - kazi you cracked
24:54 - 2000 followers oh on instagram right
25:00 - nice yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you guys
25:02 - so much we cracked 1 000 subscribers on
25:04 - our new youtube channel and
25:06 - uh 2 000 on the new instagram so thank
25:09 - you guys i appreciate that
25:10 - uh this is exactly when the million was
25:13 - broken
25:14 - so think about this and 20 there was
25:17 - some stuff i did in 2016.
25:19 - like but to be fair i really started
25:22 - end of 2016. so if you guys remember uh
25:25 - day one i don't know
25:26 - who was here day one but like if you
25:29 - guys were here day one you guys remember
25:30 - when i was talking about like i started
25:32 - in 2016.
25:34 - you guys remember that yes yes yes
25:38 - so in 2016 uh it was really the
25:41 - end of the year it was like quarter four
25:44 - of 2016 where i really actually
25:46 - committed to youtube
25:47 - other than that i wasn't making any
25:49 - videos for the last like
25:50 - you know in quarter two three barely
25:52 - making any i made probably two videos
25:54 - and those
25:55 - you know many many months like the first
25:57 - nine months
25:58 - of 2016 i made probably two videos
26:02 - so quarter four is really the quart
26:05 - quarter account in 2016 because that's
26:07 - where i made a lot of videos like
26:09 - probably 20 to
26:10 - 40 videos so i started really end of
26:13 - 2016
26:14 - and then 2019 was where we actually
26:18 - officially cleared over
26:20 - 1 million and then in 2020
26:24 - we have now it's growing really really
26:26 - fast
26:27 - so now i think we've cleared over 2.6
26:31 - million
26:34 - yeah so it's a lot it took a lot of work
26:38 - and if you guys want to
26:39 - go ahead and give a round of applause
26:41 - you can't that would make me really
26:43 - happy because i worked my ass off for it
26:45 - um but this wasn't a very exciting
26:47 - moment thank you for that gravit
26:49 - gabi i appreciate it so this was a
26:52 - crazy moment it took a lot of time and
26:54 - growth but
26:56 - what i'm what i want to show you guys
26:57 - here is the actual truth of it
26:59 - so like i didn't become a millionaire
27:01 - here it didn't happen
27:02 - here and it didn't happen here and nor
27:04 - do i want to sell you that
27:06 - does that make sense so
27:10 - it's like this is the actual truth of
27:12 - what happened for me
27:13 - so this is not something that happens
27:15 - overnight definitely not something that
27:17 - happened overnight for us
27:19 - but if you knew that this is possible
27:22 - does it make you a little bit more
27:24 - willing to actually put in the work if
27:26 - this is possible for you
27:30 - yes yeah no doubt yes okay definitely
27:34 - commander for sure awesome like
27:37 - i don't work for money yeah right
27:40 - so um but money is again i want to
27:43 - hammer this home
27:45 - money is a really important part of the
27:47 - game really [ __ ] important part of
27:49 - the game
27:50 - if you don't get this part right a lot
27:53 - of the stuff is really hard for example
27:54 - if you're doing a full-time job
27:58 - how are you really going to dedicate
27:59 - your time fully to youtube
28:01 - if that's the only way you know how to
28:03 - make an income
28:06 - like i am 12 so uh i know i know i know
28:10 - so but still it doesn't matter even if
28:12 - you're 12 and if you want to do this i
28:14 - do want you to think about it
28:16 - don't put a limit on yourself just
28:17 - because you're 12. just like i would
28:18 - tell somebody who's 79 years old don't
28:20 - put a limit on themselves
28:22 - so i i do want you guys to think about
28:26 - like
28:26 - how does the practicality of making
28:28 - income work because
28:30 - that's how like we got a team of people
28:32 - to then grow it
28:34 - but it's just something important right
28:35 - if you maybe if that's not your goal to
28:37 - hit a 1 million if it's less
28:39 - then that's okay too you can be doing
28:41 - other things and still growing your
28:42 - channel at the same time
28:44 - 2018 for us was i think 2018
28:48 - we hit um this was our year where in one
28:52 - year
28:53 - like in 2016 when i started i think in
28:55 - 2016 my income was probably
28:57 - 70 000 this year if not more
29:00 - i don't exactly remember the number but
29:02 - 2016 i think was maybe 70 between 70 to
29:05 - 100
29:05 - 000. i can't pinpoint i was doing a lot
29:08 - of like freelancing work
29:09 - in this time 2017 when i started my
29:13 - youtube channel and i actually went
29:15 - hard uh was the year where we did two
29:19 - hundred and ten thousand
29:20 - two hundred and two hundred and ten
29:23 - thousand i think
29:24 - two hundred and ten thousand uh
29:27 - 2018 we did 350 000
29:32 - in one year
29:36 - 2019 we did
29:38 - 600 000 in one year
29:44 - and then 2020 was where we did
29:47 - over 1.6 million in just one year
29:51 - like so the year is not over yet we're
29:53 - still in november
29:54 - we still have december to go
29:57 - cool so this is what the journey
30:00 - is what it looks like what it looked
30:03 - like for me
30:04 - um for me youtube became a thing really
30:07 - really quickly
30:08 - and it's kind of because of how soon i
30:11 - made the decision to go
30:12 - all in i attribute a lot of it to my
30:15 - commitment and decision to just go all
30:18 - in as soon as possible right around this
30:22 - right around this area this like
30:25 - transition from 2016 to 2017
30:27 - i was making a lot of money decent
30:30 - amount of money 70 no
30:31 - between 70 to 100 000 and i gave up all
30:34 - my clients
30:35 - i gave up literally every single dollar
30:38 - so i took that income from 70 between 70
30:40 - 100k
30:41 - and i dropped it down to a big fat zero
30:46 - i dropped that income because i knew
30:48 - that that's what's going to force me to
30:49 - actually go
30:50 - all into the business and force me to
30:53 - actually generate
30:54 - revenue from the business because if i'm
30:56 - not forced to generate revenue from the
30:58 - business i'm just gonna be kind of like
30:59 - bullshitting around for
31:00 - a really long time that makes sense
31:06 - so for you let me see if uh
31:12 - zoom still there okay if by the way
31:14 - frankie if you get any good questions or
31:16 - anything you want to pop up you can just
31:18 - bring them up
31:18 - and same thing i'm honest for you if you
31:20 - have there any good questions i can
31:22 - answer them as they come up so
31:26 - um i guess any questions right now for
31:28 - you guys that you have
31:30 - i feel like it's a good moment for some
31:31 - kind of questions you guys might have
31:33 - relevant to what i'm talking about here
31:35 - who is this uh mark mark okay go for it
31:39 - yeah so uh looking at this kind of flow
31:41 - chart of your income
31:43 - was this like strictly from monetization
31:46 - from ads or did this include
31:48 - more stuff too of course
31:52 - so for for me i i i
31:56 - leveraged youtube to sell a course
32:00 - okay that makes a lot of sense thank you
32:03 - yes
32:05 - um um i got a question too go for it
32:09 - uh okay so yesterday i was watching a
32:11 - live stream and you talked about how
32:14 - like if uh there are two youtubers in
32:17 - the same like
32:17 - genre or category they are working in
32:20 - yeah so they kind of
32:21 - promote each other right yeah so uh my
32:24 - question is like
32:26 - uh you know we learned from those people
32:29 - per se
32:29 - so we did a little sense of insecurity
32:32 - at first because
32:34 - these are like the people we learned
32:35 - from so we get the sense of what value
32:38 - would i provide
32:39 - yeah and like that particular instance
32:42 - second is that
32:43 - um like youtube in general seems
32:46 - so saturated at this point is if you
32:50 - want to do something
32:51 - okay i get that you can't do something
32:54 - totally unique
32:55 - per se um but like a tutorial about
32:58 - something
32:59 - versus a another tutorial about the same
33:01 - thing kind of feels the same
33:03 - yeah at the point so what's the point of
33:06 - like making something that already
33:08 - exists and how does that provide value
33:10 - to you that's a great
33:11 - fantastic question herman have you ever
33:13 - helped anybody in
33:14 - real life like ever a friend parent
33:18 - i actually have been programming since i
33:20 - was seven
33:21 - i manage a game dev server on discord
33:24 - not much about
33:25 - 1k people or so so yeah we're usually
33:29 - like talking to okay and do they come uh
33:32 - so give me an example of like a simple
33:34 - question somebody has asked you
33:35 - that has brought like that you have
33:37 - answered for them give me a simple
33:38 - example
33:39 - where you've helped somebody um right so
33:42 - like i met a lot of junior tips in my
33:44 - last job
33:46 - and it was mostly like like as a
33:49 - programmer it's not about learning the
33:51 - language it's about learning
33:53 - the way you're supposed to write code
33:55 - like it's problem solving more than
33:56 - anything and
33:58 - they usually have the issues with
34:01 - how can i do x now instead of trying to
34:04 - explain them how to do eggs
34:06 - i tried to explain why it works this way
34:09 - and what other approaches let me ask you
34:12 - let me ask you a question that the the
34:14 - question that they asked you
34:17 - was an answer for that available if they
34:20 - looked online hard enough
34:23 - yeah exactly cool but it was more like i
34:25 - was right next to them we're working
34:27 - together
34:27 - so this is something i want to share
34:28 - with you right
34:32 - if and i want everybody who's listening
34:34 - to this to think and recall a moment
34:36 - where you might have helped somebody
34:38 - with anything
34:39 - in life and maybe it was a question that
34:41 - was already out there
34:42 - that you answered for them so in this
34:45 - case
34:46 - and i think you kind of right i see you
34:48 - guys nodding your heads and kind of
34:49 - feeling it
34:50 - so herman this is where i'm getting what
34:52 - i'm getting at here is
34:55 - there's plenty of times where we'll
34:57 - answer questions that already the
34:59 - answers to them exist
35:00 - most of our life right right but
35:03 - maybe the way i share it maybe the way
35:07 - you share it hits home for that person
35:10 - right where the world is not so like
35:13 - what i want to say is the world is not
35:14 - like
35:15 - made of robots that are like well this
35:17 - information is already indexed duplicate
35:19 - question
35:20 - cancelled form deleted that's what
35:22 - happens a lot in that [ __ ] forum
35:25 - discord and all that world i i mean
35:27 - being a programmer for too long kind of
35:29 - gives you that mindset yes yes it's a
35:31 - really it's a toxic mindset
35:34 - um and so for me even though i was part
35:36 - of the programming community i was
35:38 - never a part of the programming
35:39 - community ever like i never
35:42 - joined any forums because it always just
35:45 - felt like it was just elitist
35:47 - and like any time if you even remotely
35:49 - have a similar
35:50 - thought like literally even a similar
35:53 - even if you use like sometimes
35:54 - similar words but it's a different
35:56 - question like i've gotten shut down
35:58 - or my questions got deleted and they're
36:00 - like no
36:01 - figure it out like so so many haters so
36:04 - many haters
36:04 - so many haters right those voices is
36:07 - just not a kind place to be on
36:08 - most of the time right remember what i
36:11 - was talking to about uh stack overflow
36:13 - so like let me just give you some
36:14 - background i'm a senior mobile developer
36:16 - i've made some of the biggest apps on
36:18 - the planet
36:19 - disney plus sonos like giant apps i
36:22 - asked a question on stack overflow
36:24 - and they deleted my question spotlight
36:27 - imagine if i have a question about
36:29 - something that has to do with mobile
36:32 - it's very specific and then someone's
36:34 - like oh uh yeah it's a duplicate
36:36 - question
36:37 - like no big deal you suck you know like
36:40 - how is this possible like i am i am more
36:43 - senior than whoever
36:44 - shut that question down and so that's
36:48 - that's the world you live in so when
36:50 - you're answering questions
36:51 - you can't think about it like oh this
36:53 - way or that way it's very important
36:55 - to always know that maybe somebody likes
36:59 - maybe someone's searching for something
37:00 - right right when you answer it
37:03 - so it's it's your answer that they want
37:05 - it might not be some
37:07 - weird technical stack overflow it's like
37:09 - a friendly video answering something
37:11 - yeah i know that that's what i've done
37:13 - yes you know i did the exercise last
37:14 - night and
37:15 - you know it's like that's the beginning
37:17 - of the journey nice beautiful answer
37:20 - um there's also this other thing that
37:24 - like it's psychology at most um like
37:26 - most people don't like the sound of
37:28 - their own voice
37:31 - and that kind of has to go like a long
37:33 - way understanding why
37:34 - not more people like your god videos per
37:37 - se because it's hard to
37:38 - put out like put yourself out there
37:40 - considering what the internet is you
37:42 - like your voice no
37:45 - i like i have social anxiety even being
37:48 - on this i feel
37:49 - i just joined it because i was like
37:52 - maybe i can put myself a bit forward
37:54 - maybe that would help me open up i also
37:56 - stream from time to time but
37:57 - yeah i don't know how this is gonna go
38:00 - but right it's okay
38:01 - yeah that makes sense like how do you
38:04 - like one is like
38:05 - you know as i said like the market is
38:06 - kind of saturated
38:08 - so how do you find your niche or like in
38:11 - general how do you find
38:12 - okay this is what works for me
38:14 - personally like how do you know this
38:16 - works
38:17 - it's not about the experimenting phase
38:18 - it's about like evaluating that
38:20 - experimentation data per se
38:22 - right okay so i love this and few things
38:25 - here one i actually think
38:27 - um your voice is very interesting like i
38:30 - actually
38:31 - really it's almost like hypnotizing i
38:33 - don't know what it is
38:34 - so i agree i actually think you your um
38:38 - your voice is really interesting second
38:40 - uh
38:41 - let's not spotlight me let's spotlight
38:42 - the person who's question i'm answering
38:44 - thank you
38:45 - so that that's one important thing i
38:48 - want to i do want to say
38:49 - second is what i want
38:52 - you to work on right i don't know if you
38:55 - were here
38:56 - yesterday um yesterday's call so similar
38:59 - thing i want you to get
39:01 - like out of your head right similar
39:03 - thing i had a conversation with devin
39:04 - about i want you to get out of your head
39:06 - and into your body youtube is
39:09 - uh there's this world of perfect science
39:12 - perfect math
39:13 - perfect programming and then there's art
39:18 - youtube is a lot of art combined with
39:20 - maybe some like
39:21 - mathematical thinking meaning like using
39:24 - historical data to like make
39:26 - like videos that you kind of know are
39:27 - gonna work but there's a lot of
39:29 - art there's a lot of human element to it
39:31 - so less
39:32 - thinking in terms of like precision data
39:36 - guaranteed something's gonna work
39:38 - uncertainty is something you have to
39:40 - like actually embrace
39:42 - uh i mean it's just probabilities at the
39:44 - end of the day you kind of have to do it
39:46 - to know that it works or
39:47 - yes for you honestly i want you to make
39:50 - youtube
39:50 - like i think right now for you i
39:52 - wouldn't even have a discussion
39:54 - about like planning [ __ ] out and and
39:57 - what's the best way for you to go what i
39:59 - know like my anxiety is so worse
40:02 - i have like i just recently bought like
40:04 - an entire setup i got a good mic i got
40:06 - like good enough recording equipment and
40:08 - stuff yeah but just i can't
40:10 - bring myself out of my own bubble and
40:12 - i'm aware of this
40:13 - yes but like i try to help myself but
40:15 - there's no way i can physically make
40:17 - myself do it like i got
40:18 - like i need a more sort of force
40:21 - pushing me towards doing it yes because
40:24 - that's what i feel the lack of
40:26 - yes um but then again like we all have
40:28 - priorities in life per se and i do want
40:30 - to do youtube it's something you really
40:32 - really want to do
40:33 - yeah a lot of friends have been asking
40:34 - me to do it as well but
40:37 - then again um it's just the fear of
40:40 - being judged
40:41 - but that kind of comes with being human
40:44 - i guess
40:44 - yes and i know like that would go away
40:46 - with time but initially like i know
40:48 - it takes a lot to upload your first
40:51 - video per se
40:52 - but some people just do it effortlessly
40:54 - and that kind of makes me more anxious
40:56 - about it
40:57 - yeah so right there's a lot of like
40:59 - comparison of what
41:01 - other people are doing and stuff like
41:02 - that's happening i know the fear that
41:04 - you feel
41:06 - not social because i've worked my ass
41:08 - off to come a lot of my social fears
41:10 - including like approaching strangers and
41:13 - crazy [ __ ] that helped me get out of it
41:15 - but i know the fear because i am
41:19 - extremely scared to jump in a pool in my
41:23 - own house
41:24 - it's only a six feet pool and it's it
41:26 - doesn't go deeper than that
41:28 - i've had traumatizing experiences where
41:29 - i've like drowning experiences
41:31 - and so i kind of know how to swim but
41:34 - i'm like
41:35 - terrified i jump right it took me 20
41:38 - minutes
41:39 - to jump in and i felt like my whole life
41:41 - was going to end i jumped in
41:43 - and literally like i wanted to i
41:45 - panicked so hard it's on video so maybe
41:47 - i'll share with you guys
41:48 - one day right but i did it a few weeks
41:49 - ago and i couldn't just stop like
41:51 - hyperventilating and i got out i was
41:54 - proud that i did it but it was scary as
41:56 - [ __ ]
41:58 - i honestly found you to be the best
42:00 - person to
42:02 - for me to be asking questions too per se
42:04 - yeah because we have a lot of
42:06 - common background heritage from where we
42:08 - come from like i come from punjab which
42:10 - is
42:10 - you know we have like a lot of history
42:12 - where if you're from bishopville
42:14 - right and like that sort of mindset that
42:17 - they build you when you're little like
42:19 - the whole school thing and yeah
42:20 - it kind of gets to you at the point yeah
42:23 - and that's what kind of i'm suffering
42:24 - with i've tried a lot
42:25 - to do harmony hormone right we're gonna
42:28 - saw one few
42:30 - we're gonna take deeper questions later
42:32 - and i would love to get in it with you
42:34 - but what i want you to work on is if you
42:36 - can maybe even find a partner from here
42:38 - or just make a video even if you're not
42:41 - gonna publish it
42:42 - okay for you i want you to like actually
42:45 - commit to an action step and say it in
42:46 - the comments that you're gonna commit to
42:48 - um okay so if it's about commitment
42:51 - let's do this right i'll make a video by
42:53 - tomorrow
42:54 - this meeting and maybe we can show it to
42:56 - others maybe that would help okay
42:58 - yeah i think so right yeah i can try
43:01 - like i can try something like i can try
43:02 - putting something to it in a day or so

44:03 - yes is it i just wanted to ask a
44:07 - question
44:08 - okay real quick is it relevant to this
44:11 - here
44:14 - uh not this okay but let's you okay
44:17 - let's
44:17 - address it a little bit later okay i'll
44:20 - take on a lot of questions afterwards i
44:21 - promise
44:22 - cool i'll take on a lot of questions so
44:24 - yeah this is if if you guys have a
44:26 - question relevant to this
44:28 - then we can get into it but otherwise
44:30 - just hold your questions for a little
44:31 - bit later please
44:34 - what wait did olivia say something
44:41 - no okay cool i think she had background
44:43 - he's trying to say something
44:45 - okay i'm trying okay go for it
44:50 - um as far as growth i know you said that
44:53 - um
44:54 - to build a brand with youtube but this
44:56 - is
44:57 - like instagram i know you said you used
44:59 - tik tok
45:00 - but did you use your instagram to um
45:03 - actually
45:04 - build your brand on there as well um
45:07 - i didn't start really taking instagram
45:09 - seriously like late into 2019
45:14 - yeah so almost every single dollar
45:18 - almost like 95 of it is attributed to i
45:21 - attribute it to youtube
45:24 - okay and somebody asked me this when is
45:27 - a good time to launch it i launched it
45:28 - with like about 10 or 20 000 youtube
45:30 - subscribers says are
45:32 - i know you asked me that question so
45:35 - uh that's a good place to start it at
45:37 - like you can once you get a little bit
45:39 - of momentum behind you
45:40 - uh because i know because i've done it
45:44 - enough i know that if you
45:45 - do launch it it works it's almost like
45:47 - freaking science
45:50 - why i have some people sell something
45:53 - really quickly is because i like
45:55 - for you to see and believe yourself that
45:58 - it's possible
45:59 - so that's why i push people to like do
46:01 - just a little bit of sales right in the
46:03 - start
46:03 - so you can like see what it feels like
46:06 - and get that it's real like oh my god
46:07 - the money is
46:08 - actually in my bank account like from
46:10 - this thing that i did online it's real
46:14 - i can now calm down and just like focus
46:16 - on the actual work
46:17 - so that's why i have people do it but if
46:19 - you can have more
46:21 - faith then i recommend you like just put
46:24 - up content and grow
46:26 - and wait to actually do the part where
46:28 - you ask for the sale
46:31 - the longer you can wait the
46:34 - better your launch is gonna do the more
46:37 - you're gonna crush
46:41 - cool so that's that's an important part
46:44 - of the game so for me
46:46 - you know this was comprised of i think
46:49 - uh
46:49 - two i think we did like two
46:53 - two product launches that entire year
46:56 - and then
46:57 - boom that's actually what happened and
46:58 - maybe i can show specifically
47:02 - um let me see if i can show this without
47:05 - any
47:08 - uh okay cool let me actually just check
47:13 - there's a way i can show it in like a
47:15 - good way
47:22 - okay cool
47:25 - cool all right so what i'm doing right
47:27 - now is i'm preparing to show you guys
47:29 - something
47:30 - and um i'm just doing it in a way where
47:32 - it's like
47:34 - i don't reveal any sensitive information
47:36 - so just give me one second and i'm gonna
47:39 - pop it open for you guys okay
47:43 - all right there we go
47:52 - all right cool so this is what
47:55 - that year looks like now i'll show you
47:57 - guys
47:58 - boom all right
48:01 - so are you guys taking a look at this
48:03 - right now
48:04 - yeah yes so this is the first year
48:08 - um so actually i made more than i
48:11 - thought in the first year i said the
48:12 - wrong number apparently
48:14 - uh how many of you guys would like to
48:16 - make
48:17 - this in your first year
48:23 - yeah be happy cool
48:26 - um so whenever i say that stuff i'm
48:28 - always like man i just hate
48:30 - sounding like those get rich quick
48:32 - people i [ __ ] hate that
48:33 - so like that sounds like ah but um
48:37 - it's again just to nothing i hate
48:39 - bragging
48:40 - so it's really not to do that it's just
48:42 - to share with you like what i came
48:44 - across
48:44 - and so i want to just share that all
48:46 - right and please don't take it like
48:48 - bragging or anything
48:50 - so um i did the first
48:53 - product launch i think in march so like
48:55 - for example here's what i want you to
48:57 - look at right so let me
48:58 - just erase this and go here
49:01 - you guys see these like this spike right
49:03 - here and then this spike right here and
49:05 - then this spike right here right
49:08 - yes okay so now what's happening
49:12 - with these spikes is actually this is
49:14 - this is the first time i'm asking people
49:16 - to buy
49:18 - this is the second time i'm asking
49:20 - people to buy
49:22 - and this is the third time i just asked
49:24 - people to buy
49:25 - does that make sense
49:28 - yes totally yeah and what kind of call
49:31 - the action was that
49:33 - um so it's i mean it's a whole product
49:37 - launch
49:38 - but like basically the simplest way i
49:41 - can put it is
49:42 - i like literally i just ask for the sale
49:45 - so i'll give you value
49:46 - and then i'm like hey if you're enjoying
49:48 - our thing like
49:49 - this is our course you can join it now
49:53 - we can get into copywriting at some
49:54 - point and you can of course get better
49:56 - at the sales process you can
49:58 - get better at the copywriting process
50:00 - but the simplest way i can put it
50:02 - even if you're a [ __ ] like you don't
50:04 - want to learn any marketing you don't
50:05 - want to learn any copywriting i believe
50:07 - that
50:08 - you might not have numbers like these
50:09 - but you will still do really good and be
50:11 - able to replace your job
50:13 - by just asking for the sale at some
50:16 - point
50:19 - okay so it's like a product launch do
50:21 - any of you guys know brands like
50:23 - hype um it's called what is it called no
50:26 - not hype
50:27 - supreme my bad supreme they're so built
50:30 - on hype that i literally call them hype
50:33 - uh but do any of you guys know the brand
50:34 - supreme for clothing
50:37 - yeah i mean they just sell because they
50:39 - have a brand right
50:40 - so like they stack the logo they built
50:43 - the brand
50:44 - and they made it so hot and then they do
50:46 - these drops so like the whole year they
50:49 - sell only a few times they don't
50:51 - actually sell very often
50:52 - they just do these like big drops and
50:54 - that's it so and then it's over
50:56 - so for me i just do these drops
51:00 - in between that time i just shut the
51:02 - [ __ ] up and work and give value
51:04 - does that make sense so like he yeah
51:08 - so like here it's me making zero
51:11 - like so i know that you guys want to
51:13 - make like um
51:16 - so like here right so let's see this was
51:18 - one of my first weeks i did the launch
51:20 - so march march 2017.
51:23 - so 163 97 507
51:27 - 584 3697 so basically let's just say in
51:31 - one week
51:33 - of doing this launch i probably cleared
51:35 - like seven thousand dollars
51:38 - is that a good number for one week
51:42 - yeah cool that's bothered cash come on
51:46 - so that's a good number okay great oh
51:48 - actually it was uh no no i'm sorry it
51:50 - was actually like uh
51:51 - fifteen thousand dollars my bad fourteen
51:53 - or fifteen thousand dollars in one week
51:54 - right that was the first launch
51:56 - but who here wants to make zero dollars
52:01 - for three months i don't
52:05 - yeah biggest racing is it depends if i
52:07 - have enough money in the bank too
52:10 - right so like it's like a lagging
52:12 - indicator guys it's like you have to
52:13 - remember you got to put the work in
52:15 - first then you're getting cash in on the
52:17 - work
52:18 - yeah so that's the really hard part for
52:20 - most people where it's like okay this
52:22 - part here
52:23 - is the part where you literally do zero
52:26 - dollars and then you work your
52:27 - ass off like in terms of content value
52:30 - engaging with people making sure you're
52:32 - answering their questions
52:33 - all of that right so that's the first
52:35 - launch
52:36 - now the second launch i did in the first
52:39 - year was right here so let's go
52:41 - there so the oh this this actually was a
52:44 - pretty good launch
52:45 - day one of the launch we did seven
52:46 - thousand seven thousand dollars
52:50 - whoops and then 2500 and then 5500 and
52:53 - then 4100
52:54 - and then how would you guys like to have
52:56 - a day 19 000
52:58 - a day yes
53:01 - why not so that so this chunk over here
53:05 - for the second launch i believe was
53:09 - um probably
53:13 - sixty thousand dollars the sixty
53:16 - thousand dollars sounds good in one week
53:21 - sure that's awesome hopefully sounds
53:23 - good
53:25 - so that's that was week two or sorry
53:28 - launch two
53:29 - and then anybody want to guess what
53:31 - launch three did you get you guys can
53:33 - see launch three is pretty
53:35 - massive day one was 22.
53:39 - so like i'll just show you like this
53:41 - launch
53:42 - there was one day where we on just one
53:45 - day i think did
53:47 - 40 000. so that's like one of the days
53:50 - and then one of the
53:51 - so like yeah just give me what are you
53:52 - guys saying overall like
53:54 - take a guess on the launch number three
53:58 - 180 what would you say
54:03 - 180 000 180 000 any other guesses
54:08 - thousand 97 seven thousand what else
54:13 - 500k what else
54:18 - all right so 100k nice
54:22 - all right so for this one it was
54:25 - actually 150
54:26 - 000. cool
54:30 - and that was um
54:33 - this was over the course of one week how
54:37 - does that sound hundred fifty thousand
54:39 - over the course of one week
54:41 - perfect he's just perfect i like that
54:45 - cozy just a quick question yes um like
54:48 - you're doing like different uh
54:50 - courses per se right so are all these
54:52 - sales coming in from the most recent
54:55 - course you created yes
54:56 - or is it like a compound of the previous
54:58 - ones as well
54:59 - because like people would discover you
55:01 - so they might buy
55:02 - something else as well right yeah like
55:04 - they don't necessarily have to
55:06 - buy just one thing right but mostly all
55:08 - the best results we got was just by
55:10 - focusing on
55:11 - one product at a time that's why we
55:12 - exploded like and just
55:15 - crushed everybody else in the market
55:16 - because like just uh i get that like
55:19 - yeah you
55:20 - did a call to action for like a
55:21 - particular course and people joined that
55:23 - course
55:23 - what i'm asking is if you like let's say
55:26 - you created a python
55:27 - course per se and um does the value of
55:30 - it like does
55:31 - the new users you get time dies off
55:34 - because youtube kind of keeps promoting
55:36 - your video if it's good right
55:38 - right like there's no into it it's
55:40 - compound it will grow with time
55:41 - yes um so do the sales like grow
55:45 - little as time progresses yes your daily
55:48 - sales or it gets stable at the time so
55:50 - i'll tell you this right
55:52 - okay okay cool i got you i got you so
55:53 - here's here's what
55:55 - it is so this business model like like
55:58 - doing
55:58 - nothing and then launches called feast
56:00 - or famine business model okay
56:02 - so like for example in between here i'm
56:05 - making pretty much zero dollars
56:08 - in between here i'm making now a little
56:11 - bit more than zero dollars it's probably
56:13 - a few thousand dollars
56:15 - uh in between here i'm also i'm now
56:19 - making a little bit
56:20 - more so it's a few thousand dollars more
56:22 - right so
56:23 - they are compounding over time yes so as
56:25 - it
56:26 - goes if we go forward and forward into
56:28 - time like for example let's just say we
56:30 - go to like
56:32 - maybe 2019 and we just take a look at
56:35 - this and let's go maybe
56:40 - oh man it's taking a really long time to
56:42 - load but you guys can see in the
56:43 - background
56:45 - like what happened with the days where
56:47 - we weren't making sales
56:49 - it those are the days that are now
56:50 - starting to get filled out does that
56:52 - make sense
56:52 - right right so that's that's what i was
56:55 - asking
56:56 - yup so that's kind of what happened so
56:58 - yes the compound effect
56:59 - is very real i say youtube is like uh
57:02 - compound interest on steroids
57:05 - right i mean it's a digital product you
57:08 - don't have to manage any inventory you
57:09 - don't have to like
57:10 - refill your inventory it's just one
57:12 - thing and yeah
57:13 - that's actually the day so i love what
57:15 - you just said there was one day where it
57:17 - like
57:18 - really blew my freaking mind where i
57:21 - went from
57:22 - um i went to i went to go
57:26 - skydiving with my friends so i went
57:29 - skydiving with my friend
57:31 - i wanted to surprise him for his
57:32 - birthday and i went skydiving
57:34 - and they had to make us watch these
57:37 - videos to make sure that like we
57:38 - understand that we can die so there's
57:40 - this like this old dude like
57:42 - it's like nine years old has this giant
57:44 - beard and the entire
57:46 - the entire video he's just talking about
57:48 - like death he's like
57:50 - so in the case of death you have to
57:53 - inform your family members and put your
57:55 - contact information so we can contact
57:57 - them i'm like holy [ __ ] like
57:59 - i'm already excited and nervous because
58:01 - my first time
58:02 - the whole time this guy's just talking
58:03 - about death and i'm like man this is
58:05 - kind of scary
58:05 - should i do this and then we
58:09 - finally like going through this crazy
58:11 - adrenaline rush finally get in the
58:12 - airplane
58:13 - and what was the scariest part anybody
58:16 - here skydived
58:17 - anybody here skydived let me see
58:21 - a view of everyone does bungee jumping
58:24 - count that rope thing
58:25 - adam did frank did nice so um
58:29 - so it's got it's just so it's like a
58:31 - crazy thing
58:32 - i'm uh when you do it it's like ton of
58:35 - fun it's really enjoyable
58:36 - but the scariest part for me about
58:39 - skydiving was actually the part
58:41 - where the plane is going up because it's
58:44 - anticipation of the fear
58:46 - so like that was just such a scary part
58:48 - and i was like oh my god what the hell's
58:49 - gonna happen every
58:51 - and then i saw the trees go from like
58:53 - trees and cars go from cars
58:55 - to like they turn into these tiny little
58:58 - like invisible
58:59 - molecules from this and i'm like we're
59:02 - gonna
59:02 - jump from here and then we saw the one
59:04 - of the instructors jump out and my heart
59:06 - i'm just sitting there my heart's like
59:07 - beating my palms are sweating
59:10 - and i'm literally thinking we should
59:12 - quit and go back but it was so
59:14 - scary and it would have been so like
59:17 - at that point it would have been too
59:18 - embarrassing to go back
59:20 - then it would have been to just jump out
59:22 - so i was like let's just jump out
59:25 - we jump out and like um i remember the
59:28 - moment
59:28 - the video was there stacy says i'm
59:30 - terrified of heights i remember that
59:32 - exact moment right
59:34 - where the camera or sorry the because i
59:36 - saw my video in the camera
59:38 - later but i was about to jump out of the
59:40 - plane and you see
59:41 - all life just leave my body like
59:44 - literally my face just goes
59:47 - it's like i've seen death and then he
59:50 - pushes me off
59:51 - and i'm like
60:00 - like crazy my face is everywhere my
60:02 - cheeks are like deformed
60:04 - i'm like laughing i'm having fun it's
60:06 - like literally the best moment of my
60:08 - life that i've experienced but i'm
60:09 - scared at the same time i have this
60:12 - brilliant experience right then they
60:14 - pull the parachute at that one point and
60:17 - then it's just like calm it's like
60:18 - smooth sailing
60:20 - we get to the bottom they interview us
60:22 - unbelievable experience
60:23 - and when it comes and then when we leave
60:26 - i'm thinking about man
60:28 - it was such an amazing experience it was
60:30 - so fun
60:31 - and then i thought about i'm like how
60:33 - much did that cost so i asked my friend
60:35 - i'm like i forgot how much it cost him
60:36 - like how much was it and he's like oh it
60:38 - was like
60:38 - 300 bucks and i was like
60:43 - whoa hold on you're telling me that
60:47 - they gave us an experience of our life
60:50 - they had to
60:51 - risk multiple people in the airplane and
60:54 - the skydivers life to jump with us and
60:56 - help us
60:58 - they had to like have an
61:01 - airplane they had to have like
61:04 - full-time people that are trained that
61:07 - are doing thousands of jumps they have
61:08 - to pay
61:09 - them there were so many things that they
61:13 - had to take care of
61:14 - and they charged 300 and at that exact
61:17 - same moment i looked at my phone
61:19 - and i just got a sale of 500 for my
61:22 - course
61:26 - and i was like that is kind of crazy
61:30 - it's kind of almost like in a way i was
61:32 - like is that unfair is that ethically
61:34 - wrong
61:35 - because i'm not risking my life i don't
61:37 - have inventory
61:39 - nothing happens to me there's no risk
61:43 - and it made me start realizing wow it is
61:46 - so
61:47 - great of an opportunity that we have
61:48 - where you can actually have what's in
61:50 - your head whatever value that you have
61:52 - you can share with people
61:53 - they'll pay you for it and there's no
61:56 - like there's there's no inventory none
61:58 - of that
61:59 - right so that's one of the things that i
62:01 - thought about
62:02 - that i feel like is very cool about the
62:05 - opportunity that we have and the world
62:07 - that we actually live in
62:08 - uh gabi go ahead
62:11 - hi cassie i have a question how many
62:14 - subscribers do you have when
62:16 - when you launch your your course
62:19 - so there were three launches which
62:22 - launched
62:22 - um the first one cool so the first
62:26 - launch that i did i believe that by that
62:28 - time i had maybe
62:30 - somebody can verify this for me but i
62:32 - believe that i had between 10 to
62:34 - 20 000 youtube subscribers
62:38 - um yeah
62:41 - i believe that's what it was and how
62:44 - much did your cause
62:45 - with your curse cost so this launch
62:49 - was the course cost 47
62:52 - which i realized was a mistake like you
62:54 - should charge much higher
62:56 - but then just make your course inc like
62:59 - way better
63:01 - but just charge way higher it's like way
63:03 - better to charge way higher you get
63:05 - higher quality customers you can give
63:07 - them like they're not going to be a pain
63:09 - in the ass at all
63:10 - and they're there to like be serious and
63:13 - learn and be committed when you pay you
63:14 - pay attention
63:16 - right so has that happened with you guys
63:18 - where you paid a lot for something and
63:19 - then you
63:20 - like really paid attention to that same
63:22 - thing right where you get that same
63:24 - advice for free
63:26 - people even when you give that same
63:27 - advice for free to people they don't
63:29 - really care they're like yeah yeah yeah
63:30 - gabi i already know you that's cute
63:33 - but then if you charge somebody for it
63:34 - they're like oh my god
63:36 - that was life changing so those are the
63:39 - kinds of people you get
63:41 - it truly changes their life supporting
63:43 - them is so much easier and it's a breeze
63:46 - so um so yeah like that was one big
63:49 - lesson we learned
63:50 - but that was my that was the price of my
63:52 - course at that time gabi
63:55 - okay perfect thank you very much you got
63:58 - it
63:59 - hey kelly i have a quick question who is
64:01 - this uh vicente ramos
64:03 - okay vicente go for it hey um so
64:07 - i if i i was one of their students from
64:10 - prophet um proper priority with python
64:13 - and
64:13 - at that time when you made your courses
64:16 - did you have a team
64:17 - or was did you do like a certain amount
64:19 - of video
64:20 - yourself and then you got the team
64:22 - before like
64:23 - did you get a team after you started
64:25 - making a certain amount of money or
64:27 - like that's a great question that's a
64:30 - great question so
64:31 - i knew i i know to think of everything
64:33 - in terms of skills
64:35 - everything like for example right uh
64:38 - when i
64:39 - all money is right what is money guys
64:42 - money
64:42 - is literally nothing but just a lagging
64:46 - indicator of skill
64:47 - and value if you develop enough skill in
64:50 - a certain area
64:52 - and then you give that value to somebody
64:55 - then they give you money back in return
64:58 - for example if olivia's really good at
65:00 - mindset she has worked all really hard
65:04 - to develop those skills
65:05 - she's probably studied tony robbins she
65:07 - probably has looked at gary vee
65:09 - she's probably studied books a bunch of
65:11 - stuff right she talks about the law of
65:13 - attraction
65:14 - she had to spend a lot of time
65:16 - developing that skill
65:18 - yes or no she had to develop a lot spend
65:20 - a lot of time developing that skill
65:21 - right
65:22 - yes then she had to spend time giving
65:25 - that
65:26 - value to somebody and then she just
65:28 - makes money
65:29 - for that that so that's all that money
65:32 - is
65:33 - at the end of the day it's a skill that
65:34 - you develop if gabi has a skill of
65:36 - finances
65:37 - she had to spend a lot of time acquiring
65:39 - that skill
65:41 - and then she gave value to somebody and
65:43 - she got money in return
65:45 - so right so skill is the ultimate thing
65:48 - that you need to develop and then you
65:51 - get paid for it and all of that
65:53 - so when i think about skills i'm like
65:56 - okay if everything comes down
65:58 - to skills then what's the most important
66:01 - thing is for me to learn the skill of
66:03 - working with people
66:05 - because people are the most important
66:07 - that's how the ideas come
66:09 - and that's how all of the breakthroughs
66:11 - happen
66:12 - so if people are um everything and guys
66:16 - just one thing i do want to let you know
66:18 - i see olivia
66:19 - yeah cool so one thing i want to let you
66:21 - guys know is
66:22 - we're not done yet we're going to keep
66:24 - going but for day
66:26 - 5 happens tomorrow that's we're going to
66:28 - create your blueprint
66:30 - okay that's where we're gonna create
66:32 - your path to actually
66:33 - crushing it on youtube make sense guys
66:37 - so tomorrow's so tomorrow is gonna be a
66:40 - really important day
66:41 - tomorrow is probably the most important
66:43 - day so
66:44 - make sure that you guys have that
66:46 - already scheduled in
66:48 - same time 11 a.m tomorrow and we're
66:50 - gonna get started pacific right
66:52 - california time
66:53 - and if you guys have questions or
66:54 - anything bring those
66:56 - just wanted to say that as a reminder so
66:59 - vicente for me
67:00 - i realized that just like programming
67:03 - was a skill that i developed i got paid
67:05 - six figures for it
67:07 - youtube was a skill i developed and i
67:09 - got paid a lot for it i knew that
67:12 - people were one of the best skills to
67:14 - develop
67:16 - on my team and learning how to work with
67:18 - them because i knew that all the biggest
67:19 - people knew how to work with people
67:21 - like everybody who's created the biggest
67:23 - companies so
67:24 - i started hiring people as soon as i
67:27 - possibly could
67:28 - like literally even when i had 500 bucks
67:31 - or 50 bucks or 100 bucks
67:33 - i would hire people and work with them
67:36 - um cassie uh hold on hormone right now
67:39 - hold on
67:40 - right now it's vicente vicente go for it
67:44 - oh no thank you thank you for the answer
67:47 - and i appreciate it
67:48 - okay got it awesome um
67:53 - so yeah okay hopefully that brought you
67:54 - value and and you got value out of it
67:57 - um cool uh isa isa is it isa
68:03 - uh yes it's isabey and charlie hi issa
68:05 - okay go for it
68:07 - uh hi i have a few questions go for it
68:11 - okay uh one is how many minutes do you
68:14 - recommend for a an average youtube video
68:18 - as long as as long as that video
68:21 - as long as it needs to be
68:24 - okay yep so as long as that video needs
68:27 - to be so if you have a message
68:28 - that is only three minutes long then
68:31 - it's three minutes
68:32 - if you have a message that takes 45
68:34 - minutes to come out then it's 45 minutes
68:36 - some of my best performing videos isa
68:39 - i have videos that are 15 minutes that
68:42 - are at 2 million views
68:43 - and then i have vid i have a video
68:45 - that's 12 hours
68:46 - literally it's a 12 hour youtube video
68:48 - and it's at 1.8 million views wow
68:52 - that's great so as long as it needs to
68:55 - be
68:56 - okay and uh my other question is a bit
68:58 - uh personal
69:00 - why did you choose to open a channel
69:02 - with your name rafi
69:03 - kazi and uh which uh
69:09 - what did you what do you suggest can i
69:11 - open a channel with my name
69:13 - or with an adjective or another name
69:16 - which is not mine
69:17 - got it great question so for me
69:20 - the coding channel it makes a lot of
69:22 - sense for it to be called clever
69:24 - programmer and that's just like
69:26 - now it's a brand and so for example
69:28 - tomorrow there could be other teachers
69:30 - teaching on there
69:31 - and growing it like coding is not
69:34 - something that
69:35 - like is gonna be you know what i'm
69:37 - saying like i'm not coding all the time
69:39 - i'm running a company
69:41 - like now i'm running a company i'm
69:42 - focused on actually impacting people's
69:44 - lives i don't care if it's
69:46 - me coding and impacting lives but i just
69:48 - care that
69:49 - there might i might inspire their
69:50 - developers to create content on there so
69:52 - then they can change lives
69:54 - my channel rafikaze is on my life's
69:57 - journey
69:59 - oh yes that's why it's called rafikaze
70:01 - it's whatever journey that i'm on
70:03 - so like for me the thing that is the
70:06 - deepest and most satisfying right now
70:08 - is i love inspiring people which is
70:11 - something that
70:12 - that i've always loved i love teaching
70:14 - but right now for me the thing that i'm
70:16 - the most passionate about and i believe
70:18 - in
70:18 - the most is people starting on their
70:21 - youtube journeys
70:23 - like i understand thank you so much you
70:24 - know what i'm saying like i love i
70:26 - love seeing what it does to their
70:27 - confidence i love seeing what it does to
70:30 - their like income to their business
70:33 - how they can provide for their families
70:35 - i love everything about it so
70:39 - so yeah so rafikaze is all personal and
70:41 - slash like my life like whatever is
70:43 - happening
70:44 - and then clever programmer is a brand
70:46 - for coding
70:47 - okay thank you very much yep you got it
70:51 - and i have a follow-up question to that
70:53 - girlfriend mark
70:54 - does your rafa quasi channel also like
70:58 - do you have intentions for it to feed
70:59 - into your clever programmer channel like
71:01 - maybe people who discover you as a
71:03 - person will then be like whoa this guy's
71:05 - really great at programming or are you
71:06 - trying to keep them separate
71:08 - um i mean i'm not really trying one
71:12 - or the other i'm just trying to grow
71:13 - them independently and separately almost
71:15 - like imagine two kids right
71:18 - you like if you have two kids you don't
71:21 - necessarily want the little brother to
71:23 - just like follow under the shadow of the
71:25 - oldest brother you really want them to
71:26 - be two
71:27 - unique individual people uh that do
71:30 - their own thing
71:31 - that's my long-term goal with both of
71:33 - the channels i don't want them to
71:34 - worry about necessarily having to even
71:36 - know about each other
71:38 - they can just like they should be both
71:40 - good enough to grow
71:41 - from each other i think from clever
71:44 - programmer it's really awesome that
71:46 - from clever programmer there are a lot
71:47 - of people that are jumping into the
71:48 - rafikaze side
71:51 - yeah cool well thank you man yeah
71:56 - um cesari says qazi what do you think of
71:59 - you to me and cesar you can jump on
72:01 - somebody can spotlight you
72:03 - says what do you think of udemy it's
72:04 - nice but for me hard work can't be paid
72:06 - 10 to 12
72:07 - euro precisely for this reason my
72:09 - question is how can you fight this
72:10 - platform
72:11 - you make use you make your own
72:16 - platform which is essentially cesare
72:20 - here
72:23 - um okay he's not here but i'm gonna
72:25 - answer his question i mean wait he
72:26 - literally
72:27 - just he's not on video
72:31 - i asked him to turn video on but i mean
72:33 - he should be he
72:34 - okay got it got it got it okay so
72:37 - that's fine i'll answer this question
72:40 - um so what do i think of it i think you
72:43 - need to have your own platform like if
72:44 - i'm on udemy i
72:45 - i'm at the mercy of udemy i don't get
72:48 - the email list
72:49 - i literally like the number one most
72:51 - important thing is
72:53 - the thing that differentiated me is i
72:54 - use youtube to grow my email list
72:57 - okay so this is something i want to
72:58 - share with you guys because i think
73:00 - we're in the
73:00 - important sections of this call now and
73:03 - so i want to actually share more
73:05 - advanced strategies that i
73:06 - uh alluded to yesterday
73:09 - so let's go to my videos
73:13 - and i'll go here
73:17 - all right and i'll share my screen with
73:19 - you guys right now
73:21 - cool so if i show you guys my videos and
73:24 - we sort by like most popular
73:31 - so in this video i got about two million
73:35 - views the most important thing that i'm
73:36 - doing here
73:38 - is this right here you guys see this
73:40 - thing here
73:44 - yes that is the biggest
73:48 - secret like this is the thing that a lot
73:50 - of people don't understand
73:53 - i'm driving the people to go and join
73:56 - uh an email list so then i can let them
73:58 - know later
74:00 - like if there's a course or if there's
74:01 - an opportunity i can get the word out
74:04 - all of the revenue guys comes from
74:07 - majority of the revenue at least
74:09 - in my case i think in most people's case
74:12 - will come from your
74:13 - the people you have on your email list
74:16 - okay so this is the one important
74:19 - advanced thing i want to show you guys
74:21 - if you're thinking about starting your
74:22 - youtube channel it's a really smart idea
74:24 - to send people on your website give them
74:26 - something in return for
74:28 - free right like you give them something
74:30 - return for free so if i go to
74:32 - cleverprogrammer.com
74:34 - i'm giving you something for free how to
74:36 - become a javascript developer in 2020
74:39 - right you join it because it's a free
74:42 - training
74:43 - does that make sense i'm giving you
74:46 - something valuable
74:47 - but in exchange i get your email for it
74:50 - discounts are not a thing for discount
74:53 - like
74:54 - i stay away from that type of stuff like
74:56 - discounts and things like that
74:57 - but free training is a good thing to do
75:00 - here's another example right
75:02 - how many of you guys here oh crap
75:05 - it's gone again no help
75:08 - all right so hopefully this will be good
75:12 - how many of you guys here i actually
75:14 - want to get a sense of this
75:15 - raise your hands if you came here from
75:18 - uh if you found me from a facebook ad
75:21 - raise your hand if you found me from a
75:23 - facebook ad
75:26 - to for this training
75:29 - okay a few people got it um and you guys
75:32 - can drop it in the chat too if you how
75:34 - you found me if you found me from if you
75:36 - found this
75:37 - training the five day training i mean
75:39 - from a facebook ad
75:40 - uh drop it if you came from
75:43 - clever programmer how many of you came
75:45 - from clever programmer
75:47 - a bunch of people okay most people got
75:50 - it awesome
75:51 - so wherever you came from
75:54 - the important thing here is to
75:56 - understand that
75:58 - i get you guys are getting value
76:01 - and there's something that i'm giving
76:03 - out for free it's a five day challenge
76:04 - so you don't give anything for it but
76:06 - you're like wow this is awesome getting
76:08 - so much value and you get it for free
76:10 - so then it's a fair exchange it makes
76:12 - you want to be like okay
76:14 - when you put that you're on an email
76:16 - list right so
76:18 - then on the email list if we have a
76:19 - course uh which we're actually gonna
76:21 - drop which i'm super [ __ ] excited
76:23 - about i'm making
76:24 - the best course i'm literally like this
76:27 - is gonna be my life's work in one course
76:30 - and we're gonna be launching it and i'm
76:32 - gonna be talking about it towards the
76:33 - end of the challenge with you guys it's
76:35 - going to be called
76:35 - i'm thinking about calling it youtube
76:37 - masters academy
76:39 - i'm so excited about this and i want to
76:41 - put everything in there
76:42 - but those of you who are interested in
76:44 - going further you guys are going to
76:46 - jump into that course those of you who
76:48 - are not interested in it
76:50 - won't jump into it if you don't feel
76:51 - like i've given you enough value
76:53 - but the whole point of having the email
76:56 - list is it gets the word out does that
76:58 - make sense
77:00 - and i'm not i'm not blocked by youtube
77:03 - i'm not blocked by
77:04 - i'm not dependent on instagram i'm not
77:06 - dependent on that necessarily
77:08 - email list is it allows me to connect
77:10 - with you directly
77:11 - okay so this is one like advanced tactic
77:14 - that i wanted to share with you guys
77:16 - when it comes to you actually growing a
77:18 - youtube channel
77:19 - is build the email list from day one
77:23 - of your channel like from day one if you
77:25 - do that that's a really good idea
77:28 - um a tool that i recommend that you guys
77:31 - use to build your email list
77:33 - we use this tool i recommend using
77:35 - convertkit
77:36 - there are many other tools this is the
77:38 - best just take my [ __ ] word for it i
77:40 - know every goddamn tool on the planet
77:42 - i've been through
77:42 - every rapid hole you can imagine i know
77:45 - the insides and outs and every
77:47 - automation and every fancy tool
77:49 - like i have exhausted myself going
77:52 - through it
77:52 - so if i can help you just make a
77:54 - decision fast and simplify your life
77:58 - like i had an email tool that i had to
78:00 - pay
78:01 - 48 000 a year and
78:04 - it was awful and it was a
78:07 - nightmare to then like pull myself out
78:09 - of it at a later point
78:11 - so this is the easiest one this is the
78:15 - best one
78:16 - i believe that it lets you get started
78:17 - for free so
78:19 - i would highly recommend using
78:20 - convertkit
78:22 - to um to build your email list and get
78:25 - people on there
78:28 - people are okay so somebody said i came
78:30 - from email
78:32 - all right i found it from youtube
78:35 - youtube clever programmer
78:39 - all right mailchimp
78:42 - oh somebody said using mailchimp yeah
78:43 - get off mailchimp mailchimp sucks
78:46 - like don't be on mailchimp it's yeah it
78:49 - sucks
78:51 - uh i mean
78:54 - all right if you are a human being
78:58 - sitting face to face i'd probably say
79:01 - it's okay mailchimp is all right
79:05 - if it won't take too much energy for you
79:07 - to get off of it then get off of it
79:10 - now um yeah
79:13 - so that's kind of the actual answer i
79:14 - would give you if you were sitting face
79:16 - to face
79:18 - um and yeah mailchimp has like some
79:20 - funny stuff with like how the duplicate
79:21 - lists and
79:22 - yeah all right found from instagram ad
79:26 - awesome yeah even even i would i would
79:29 - recommend
79:30 - convertkit guys i know about mail gun i
79:32 - know about spark whatever i know about
79:34 - uh
79:35 - you know like every pla all of the
79:36 - platforms i've went through like
79:38 - ontraport and all of them
79:39 - this is the easiest one to use i
79:41 - recommend it at the end of the day
79:43 - decide whatever you want this is my
79:45 - personal recommendation for you
79:47 - uh this is a good one the other thing i
79:50 - would recommend guys
79:51 - is for you here are the steps right
79:55 - you have to make so here are the steps
79:57 - for you
79:58 - you got to have a youtube channel okay
80:00 - this is what your road to one million
80:02 - looks like if you guys want to take
80:03 - notes at this time it would be a good
80:05 - time to do that
80:06 - so youtube content this is your
80:10 - number one and most important step if
80:12 - you [ __ ] up every other step
80:15 - every other step including like not
80:16 - having a product not building an email
80:18 - list
80:18 - you will be golden you will still be
80:22 - golden
80:23 - if you don't get this part right and you
80:26 - don't put this part on a pedestal
80:28 - no matter how much i help you or you get
80:30 - fancy in business and marketing
80:32 - that every like because it's gonna be
80:33 - that's gonna be hard
80:35 - okay so that's step one we'll take
80:38 - questions later guys
80:41 - we're gonna take questions later we're
80:42 - gonna take questions later
80:44 - um so step one step number two
80:48 - is if you actually want to make the sale
80:51 - guys how can somebody pay you what do
80:53 - you need for somebody to pay you
80:57 - or actually before we get to the payment
81:00 - before we even get to the paper
81:01 - uh before we get to the payment part
81:03 - let's get let's get to the part so
81:04 - that's the right answer
81:05 - i just asked the wrong question right
81:07 - now so second part is you need to have a
81:10 - relationship with the people a way to
81:11 - communicate with them
81:13 - all right so this is the thing we just
81:15 - talked about right now so number two we
81:16 - need uh
81:22 - client list yes client list okay cool so
81:25 - that's
81:25 - the second most important thing so i
81:27 - will say email list
81:30 - client list prospect list you guys can
81:32 - call it whatever you want so this is
81:34 - step two
81:35 - of something that you're gonna need okay
81:38 - youtube content
81:40 - build your email list if you own the
81:42 - email list and tomorrow youtube gets
81:44 - destroyed
81:45 - facebook gets banned instagram gets shut
81:47 - down
81:48 - tick tock gets blocked in america you're
81:51 - gonna be fine you're always gonna have a
81:52 - business you're gonna be completely fine
81:55 - email list is yours nobody can take it
81:57 - away
81:58 - and and gabby another cool thing is you
82:00 - can put in your excel sheet and save it
82:02 - there and it'll be yours forever
82:05 - um cool so
82:08 - those are the two things number three
82:11 - now let's get to the point of
82:13 - what do you actually need for people to
82:15 - pay you like literally what is the thing
82:17 - that you need for people to pay you some
82:19 - of you guys said it for the last step
82:20 - it's for this here check out the product
82:23 - the product
82:26 - cool so
82:29 - yes so secure checkout all of that is
82:31 - going to be you know kind of like part
82:33 - of the product but i'm not i don't want
82:34 - to get too much into the weeds of it
82:36 - so at a high level this is what it looks
82:37 - like guys all right
82:39 - you make youtube content
82:43 - people like it let's say 10 000 people
82:46 - watch it
82:47 - right 100 people
82:51 - now might join your email list
82:55 - does that make sense they might be
82:58 - interested in going further getting a
83:00 - free training from you like gabi could
83:02 - have a free training on an excel sheet
83:05 - frank could have a free training on how
83:07 - he got his 170 000
83:09 - job that's by the way that's a
83:11 - phenomenal free training
83:13 - to put out um that you could give out so
83:16 - that right then number three product
83:21 - 10 000 people might watch your [ __ ] 100
83:23 - people might join your email list
83:25 - and one person might actually buy your
83:27 - product
83:30 - okay and this might actually mean for
83:32 - you whatever 297
83:34 - 597 um whatever
83:38 - right i but generally the best thing i
83:41 - can do for you is if i can get the
83:42 - thought of making a 10
83:44 - course outside of your head if i can do
83:46 - that for you that's the best thing i can
83:47 - give you
83:48 - forget about all of that and don't ever
83:50 - like do not have a course if you're
83:53 - gonna work with me or you want to follow
83:55 - me longer term
83:56 - don't have something under 100 bucks why
83:59 - it's going to make your life
84:00 - miserable you're only going to do it
84:02 - most of the time because of lack of
84:04 - self-esteem because you don't believe
84:05 - that you could charge more
84:07 - guys louis vuitton purse i mean what the
84:10 - [ __ ] is in that purse
84:11 - what is it what is in the you guys tell
84:14 - me what is in that purse that's eight
84:15 - thousand dollars what's in that purse
84:18 - unicorn tears
84:19 - there's nothing in that purse so why are
84:22 - you so scared to put your course over a
84:24 - hundred dollars when giving us so much
84:26 - value
84:28 - louis vuitton doesn't give a [ __ ] what
84:30 - walmart is doing
84:31 - they're both respectable businesses in
84:33 - their own regard
84:34 - so don't give a [ __ ] what udemy is doing
84:36 - with udacity
84:37 - it's their business let them do it that
84:39 - way they want to sell it for ten dollars
84:42 - cool are there coding boot camps that
84:45 - are selling their coding bootcamp for
84:46 - fifteen thousand dollars
84:48 - yes their goddamn are so you if you keep
84:52 - looking at the ten dollars that's all
84:53 - you're gonna think about you're never
84:54 - gonna be able to get out of it
84:56 - i want you guys to stay away from that
84:58 - like that's like a slum
85:00 - like that's a sewer like stay away
85:03 - from fighting on pricing stay away from
85:07 - stay away from that land that's a really
85:10 - really bad
85:11 - bad place to be it's like those people
85:13 - you give them five dollars and then they
85:14 - make your life miserable like
85:16 - you know your friend just like bugging
85:18 - you hey can i have my five dollars back
85:19 - hey when
85:20 - when did you do the thing that i asked
85:22 - you like they go crazy over it whereas
85:24 - somebody
85:24 - some of my best clients or people who
85:26 - pay me like the mo
85:28 - like some of my best clients are people
85:29 - who pay me like 20 000
85:31 - i almost don't hear from them
85:35 - i have to follow up with them and i'm
85:36 - like hey are you still there
85:39 - like we're working on more stuff for you
85:40 - and they're like oh [ __ ] really
85:42 - cool so those are the people you want to
85:45 - work with and then you
85:47 - bring them your best work because you're
85:49 - in a good head space
85:51 - so this is as simple as i could make it
85:56 - now this is a good point i want to take
85:57 - your questions but keep them about this
85:59 - guys so if you have some questions
86:01 - now is the time go for it
86:04 - yeah i asked this in chat but um you
86:06 - were saying did not really
86:08 - have low value products but all of my
86:09 - products are 99 cents because i produce
86:12 - music and
86:12 - stay away from that stay away from that
86:14 - stay the [ __ ] stay the [ __ ] away
86:16 - i'll tell you something my brother he
86:19 - wanted to do color grading okay he
86:21 - wanted to show
86:22 - people how to do better color like color
86:25 - their videos
86:26 - okay so you guys know like when you
86:27 - watch a video and it looks like you're
86:29 - like i don't know why but it looks like
86:30 - it's a hollywood video and it looks so
86:32 - good like those music videos and you're
86:33 - like i don't know what it is about it it
86:34 - looks like
86:35 - [ __ ] sick that's my brother my
86:37 - brother does that [ __ ]
86:39 - all right so he
86:42 - wanted to start when he was i i inspired
86:44 - him to
86:45 - get to doing youtube right that was my
86:47 - first thing that i helped him with like
86:48 - inspired him enough to do this so he got
86:50 - started i'm like yes
86:52 - then when it came to the product he's
86:54 - like you know
86:55 - everybody's selling these uh luts and i
86:57 - think i want to sell these luts they're
86:59 - these like
87:00 - these looks that are essentially like
87:01 - plugins so think of it like plugins and
87:04 - he's like i want to sell these plugins
87:06 - and he's like everybody sells them for
87:07 - like 99 cents or two dollars and stuff
87:09 - like that
87:10 - okay i told them i'm like please bro i'm
87:13 - like
87:14 - i love you but you know that um
87:18 - how should i say this instead of um
87:21 - making a million dollars you'll make
87:23 - um 97 that year
87:26 - and i'm like i [ __ ] love you but
87:28 - that's actually what's gonna happen
87:30 - but he's gonna hop on itunes and pay
87:32 - more than a dollar for a song you know
87:35 - so don't do it i i would go you know i
87:37 - mean depends what you want to do but i
87:39 - would go a different direction like for
87:40 - example
87:41 - you can keep playing that direction and
87:43 - if you're [ __ ] rock star then you'll
87:44 - blow up right
87:46 - but if you can teach that skill to
87:49 - people
87:50 - teach skill like actually give them a
87:52 - transformation now my brother gives them
87:54 - give instead of selling luts which is
87:57 - cool
87:58 - but like now he actually gives out
88:01 - transformations and you can join his
88:02 - program and become a colorist
88:05 - you can join this program and now you
88:06 - actually have the skill to go out there
88:08 - and charge other people and
88:09 - color their [ __ ] right like we show
88:11 - people how to become a developer
88:13 - people if we give them like a little
88:15 - plug-in they'll pay us one dollar
88:17 - but if we can give them a transformation
88:19 - they're gonna pay us five hundred
88:21 - dollars seven hundred dollars one
88:22 - thousand dollars
88:23 - right so um that's
88:26 - what i want you to focus on when you
88:28 - think of creating a course
88:29 - i want you to focus on forget about how
88:32 - much
88:33 - stuff you got focus on what is the
88:36 - transformation you can give
88:39 - when you guys go to the dmv to get your
88:41 - license
88:43 - do you care if they keep you like for
88:45 - two hours
88:46 - or is it better if they leave you in one
88:48 - minute and just give you the updated
88:50 - license
88:50 - what is better
88:54 - updated live in one minute would you
88:56 - literally pay more if they could [ __ ]
88:58 - kick you out of there in like 30 seconds
89:00 - would you literally pay
89:01 - more yes
89:04 - yes everybody it's like a nightmare
89:06 - going to these legal things and sitting
89:08 - there for hours same thing here
89:11 - if you can give me a transformation i'd
89:12 - literally pay you more if you could help
89:14 - me do it faster
89:16 - or in a shorter amount of time so
89:18 - meaning you don't need to
89:20 - have 100 000 modules in your program in
89:23 - order to justify a price
89:27 - so uh that's the thing that i wanted to
89:29 - say okay
89:31 - for you mark i would go keep
89:34 - keep pumping out your songs but i think
89:38 - that if you can teach other people that
89:39 - skill that actually might be one of the
89:41 - most
89:41 - valuable things now i don't know maybe
89:43 - you're not into
89:44 - wanting to teach it which is fine but
89:46 - just know that if you were to teach that
89:48 - skill you could charge 500 because you
89:50 - can then create a transformation in
89:51 - people
89:52 - but for a song you probably cannot
89:53 - charge 500.
89:56 - that makes sense
90:00 - mark it's like imagine like i want to
90:02 - learn how to do ableton
90:03 - right i want to make old town road on
90:05 - ableton show me how to do that
90:07 - that's a course right like the finished
90:10 - product it's like hey here's a remix of
90:11 - volton road
90:13 - yes it's not as exciting that exactly so
90:16 - like inside
90:16 - that's that's money right there so like
90:18 - for example you could be
90:20 - like putting on tick tock content where
90:21 - you're like old town road
90:23 - and that's your content and i'm watching
90:25 - i'm like [ __ ] that's amazing i would put
90:27 - all that [ __ ] out for free and not
90:29 - charge for it and then in my course i'd
90:31 - be like i'll literally show you how i
90:33 - made this
90:34 - how i made the whole town road how i
90:35 - made this other song how i made this
90:36 - other song and i'll give you a breakdown
90:39 - and people would actually want to pay to
90:40 - learn how to do that
90:43 - like like i've paid for that so yeah you
90:45 - know what i mean like that's uh yeah of
90:47 - course
90:48 - i you know some help i don't know what
90:50 - the heck i'm doing i'm a beginner at it
90:52 - um so that's that's what people will pay
90:55 - for
90:55 - versus like a finished product is it's
90:58 - great
90:58 - you can i have also i have friends who
91:01 - are producers
91:02 - who also sell um
91:05 - basically like the ableton pack right
91:07 - all the the the song
91:08 - and all of the i don't honestly don't
91:11 - know what it's like the files
91:12 - to make the songs uh i do sell that also
91:16 - uh and they license things out um and
91:19 - they do
91:19 - they do pretty well there and it's not
91:21 - it's not 99 cents for sure
91:23 - it's right you know it's it's it's a
91:24 - hundred bucks and that that's sort of
91:26 - awesome so yes i agree with that that's
91:30 - right on the money so hopefully mark
91:32 - that helps you out
91:33 - we're going to go on to another question
91:36 - and then i want to keep continuing with
91:38 - this
91:38 - training all right guys so i want to
91:40 - make sure that just if you guys have
91:41 - questions right along these
91:43 - lines what mark asked i'd love to take
91:45 - them on the other questions i'll take
91:46 - them on
91:47 - a little bit later okay so
91:51 - that's the this go ahead go ahead
91:54 - because your thoughts on uh like patreon
91:57 - and stuff you know
91:58 - no uh because like some people do
92:02 - like projects don't share their servers
92:04 - and the source is kind of behind a
92:06 - payment wall or say
92:08 - yeah i mean like i'm not a fan of
92:10 - patreon like literally it's the same
92:12 - thing right so like
92:13 - and mark my brother actually did go on
92:15 - to make a million dollars my brother
92:16 - actually in one year my brother my
92:18 - brother actually just broke
92:20 - his first million in in about 12 months
92:23 - selling a 500 to 800
92:26 - course on how to become a colorist and
92:28 - then he taught
92:30 - his skills in there he taught people
92:32 - what he did for his clients where
92:34 - their music videos got 280 million views
92:37 - he breaks that [ __ ] down in his course
92:40 - nice nice
92:41 - and he's putting out all the content out
92:42 - there for free
92:44 - so i do want to share that because that
92:46 - was the difference if we went the route
92:48 - of selling a 99 cent thing
92:50 - i swear to you that he would be at 8 700
92:53 - in the whole year or max twelve thousand
92:56 - dollars
92:56 - max so okay i want you to think about
92:59 - that
93:01 - mark just to add into if you want more
93:03 - ideas for your channel if you just don't
93:05 - want
93:05 - to put like songs on youtube because
93:07 - copyright and stuff
93:09 - uh maybe you can do like a breakdown of
93:11 - stuff like how was the song created
93:13 - instead of
93:14 - like right not teaching them to create
93:16 - it but like these are the drums this
93:19 - is the bass these are the snares yes
93:21 - like
93:22 - what why what makes the song special
93:24 - stuff like that you know
93:26 - i think that would be able to break down
93:27 - select that awesome right all right
93:29 - so let's continue with this guys so uh
93:37 - here you guys cue cassie yeah what's up
93:40 - [Music]
93:42 - uh can i ask you yes you asked me three
93:45 - times bro
93:45 - you can ask me for sure go for it okay
93:48 - but uh
93:49 - i have a question in another topic not
93:52 - say youtube
93:53 - okay so let's address that later let's
93:55 - address all of those questions at a
93:57 - later time
93:58 - i want to keep going through this
93:59 - training and then we'll address your
94:00 - guys's questions
94:01 - okay thank you you got it you you got it
94:04 - all right so
94:05 - this is the path in a three-step process
94:08 - if i could break it down
94:10 - if you can be building an email list and
94:13 - launch the product when you get a
94:14 - like a thousand people on your email
94:16 - list or more that's a great time
94:18 - for you to actually launch a product i
94:20 - think that's a phenomenal time
94:22 - and you can launch your very first time
94:24 - and then go from there
94:26 - most of the times if you guys spend 95
94:29 - of your time focusing on content you
94:31 - will win
94:32 - guaranteed if the entire year you forgot
94:36 - to build the email list
94:37 - and you forgot to build the product you
94:39 - cannot go wrong with this
94:41 - where you can go wrong is if you start
94:43 - with the product you can completely go
94:45 - wrong because you have no audience and
94:47 - nobody's interest
94:48 - so like all of that can be you can then
94:50 - go hey i made a product i spent months
94:52 - now you go out there and there's nobody
94:54 - out there that's gonna buy it so
94:56 - zero people would buy it so that's the
94:58 - path i don't want you to go down
95:00 - you can't just start an email list
95:02 - without having content
95:04 - so really the path that i recommend for
95:06 - people
95:07 - the path that i believe is the best is
95:10 - start with the content first
95:14 - start with the content link things to
95:16 - your email list so for example in your
95:18 - video
95:19 - like even for example gabi in your video
95:22 - or frank if you make your youtube videos
95:24 - make sure that
95:25 - like at the 45 second mark or the one
95:27 - minute mark you can say
95:29 - by the way i do want to say i have a
95:30 - free training on how i landed a 170
95:33 - 000 a year job if you're interested in
95:36 - that
95:36 - make sure you go here put in your name
95:39 - and email below
95:40 - and it's a completely free training you
95:42 - can sign up with that said let's jump
95:44 - back into the video
95:45 - does that make sense frank 100
95:49 - i did not know about convertkit yes so
95:52 - that is like
95:54 - money right there that's like money like
95:56 - that is
95:57 - if you can just take that and actually
95:59 - apply it that same video like for
96:02 - example that video just keeps going and
96:03 - going if that video goes up to 2 million
96:05 - views
96:06 - that one video got you 50 000
96:07 - subscribers and boom that one video
96:10 - will get you like 10 000 people or 20
96:12 - 000 people on your email list
96:13 - one video the one right video literally
96:16 - never thought of that man thanks so much
96:18 - it's it's crazy dude like how that works
96:20 - it's insane and then
96:22 - you just go to those 20 000 people and
96:23 - you're like hey
96:25 - i am making some [ __ ] that like i spent
96:28 - my whole life's work on
96:29 - it's pretty awesome do you want it most
96:32 - of them
96:33 - 99 of them will say
96:36 - no thank you 99.5 of them will say no
96:39 - thank you
96:40 - half a percent of them will say yes
96:42 - that's the only half a percent you need
96:45 - in order to do 200 000 400 000
96:48 - 800 000 1.6 million dollars 2.7 million
96:52 - dollars
96:53 - 10 million that half percent is the only
96:56 - percent that you need to say yes
97:03 - so let's go
97:06 - that's the only reply what do you say
97:09 - yes that sounds amazing
97:10 - i love that bro yeah that's
97:13 - that's the that's the right uh reply
97:17 - so that i would say is a really good
97:20 - thing to focus on
97:22 - build a content email list almost forget
97:25 - about your product
97:27 - at some point ask for the sale of the
97:29 - product and you guys will be good okay
97:31 - i hope that this got brought to you guys
97:34 - does this bring you guys
97:35 - clarity by the way on what the path to
97:38 - making
97:39 - income from youtube can look like does
97:41 - that give you guys clarity on it
97:44 - definitely yeah it's a great yes
97:49 - okay awesome um because it's one of
97:52 - those things that's really hard for
97:54 - people to go hey what is the best way to
97:56 - monetize what's the best way to do this
97:58 - what's the best way to do that and i
97:59 - think a lot of the other ways are really
98:01 - complicated
98:02 - but if you can have something where you
98:04 - can share with people
98:06 - and charge for it i believe it's the
98:08 - fastest way to get to your
98:10 - like whatever your goals are like
98:11 - whether it's your income goals business
98:13 - goals
98:14 - whatever okay
98:18 - i'm just reading the chat
98:22 - uh cause your thoughts on monetizing
98:23 - channel videos yeah i monetize most of
98:25 - my videos
98:26 - uh it brings in a little bit of revenue
98:28 - for our channel but because a coding
98:29 - channel
98:30 - it's very like it's like very little
98:32 - revenue i mean
98:34 - it's four thousand seven hundred dollars
98:35 - right now that we're making every month
98:36 - from it
98:37 - um but you know yeah so
98:42 - but like how many views we're getting we
98:44 - should really be getting like way more
98:46 - revenue if we had a higher cpm
98:48 - so if we had a channel on finance or
98:50 - something
98:51 - then the revenue is way higher like
98:54 - graham stefan with this
98:56 - gram stefan because he has a channel on
98:57 - finance for the same [ __ ] i get two
98:59 - thousand dollars in a month
99:01 - graham gets two hundred thousand dollars
99:03 - in a month for that
99:05 - so yeah so his ad revenue is like
99:09 - pretty pretty nuts
99:14 - um okay i'm looking at some of the
99:15 - questions how to use the email list use
99:17 - it as a link to both the content and the
99:19 - product
99:19 - no so that's a great question the email
99:22 - list is only for
99:23 - i'm gonna give you a free training when
99:25 - you give me your email you get the free
99:27 - training that's it
99:28 - and now they're on your email list the
99:30 - only number one goal of anybody ever
99:32 - going on your website is for them to
99:33 - give you their email that's it that's
99:35 - all your website's purposes
99:36 - your website's purpose is not for your
99:39 - website to look pretty
99:40 - is not for you to have a nice logo not
99:43 - for you to build your self-esteem
99:45 - not so you could share it at the dinner
99:47 - table i'm launching a business take a
99:48 - look at my website
99:50 - none of those are reasons to have a
99:52 - website the one
99:54 - and only reason for your website is so
99:57 - people can go to it
99:58 - and they can give you their email and
100:00 - that's it that's like where your website
100:02 - will start
100:02 - that's where your website ends
100:06 - pretty weird thing but that's
100:10 - all your content on youtube websites so
100:12 - they can get your
100:13 - you can get email and then you're good
100:19 - kazi how do you send email to us what
100:21 - service convertkit that's how i send you
100:23 - guys emails that's how you guys got the
100:25 - email from
100:26 - um from today i hope you guys got an
100:29 - email today
100:30 - but that's where you guys got it from
100:33 - who's coming here from
100:35 - by the way who's coming here from the
100:36 - text that i'm sending is anybody able to
100:38 - use those
100:39 - i want to get a sense of like just raise
100:40 - your hands and keep them raised if you
100:42 - saw the text or
100:44 - if you opened the text or you saw the
100:46 - text so i see adam keep your hands
100:47 - raised the whole time rocio stacey
100:51 - matulla coyote giulio okay
100:55 - uh misha xavier okay cool
100:58 - all right all right you guys can put
101:00 - your hands on thank you so much
101:01 - i just wanted to get a sense of it so it
101:03 - seems like it's a pretty good percentage
101:04 - of the people that are getting the text
101:06 - or responding to it so
101:08 - that's something i'm experimenting with
101:10 - but i love how it allows me to like just
101:12 - connect with you directly
101:14 - like yesterday i saw something from
101:15 - giulio and i just like actually
101:16 - responded to it
101:18 - you know and like it's just one on one
101:19 - like 11 30 p.m and i'm like oh that's
101:22 - easy
101:22 - just respond whereas from email that's
101:24 - like really it's
101:25 - it's a little bit harder uh text is not
101:28 - convertkit
101:29 - for text the service i'm using is called
101:32 - community it's like bleeding edge
101:34 - i've had to go down some weird rabbit
101:36 - holes to discover it but it is
101:38 - the best i was using super phone before
101:40 - and it was ridiculous it was like 300
101:42 - for one like if i added it would go from
101:45 - 300 to like 380
101:47 - if i just add an extra exclamation mark
101:49 - at the end like literally an extra
101:51 - period at the end
101:52 - it'd be like boom like each text would
101:55 - cost me between 100
101:56 - to 500 to send to people so like
101:59 - if i had to invite you guys to the
102:00 - training it would cost me like four
102:02 - hundred dollars
102:03 - like literally to tell you guys hey
102:04 - there's a training like 400
102:06 - like jesus so super phone i'm running
102:09 - away from
102:10 - community is much better um and
102:13 - much easier guys another service
102:16 - probably
102:17 - the most important one if you are
102:19 - thinking about launching a course
102:22 - um okay let me ask you guys that you are
102:25 - on this call
102:26 - what are you guys trying to uh
102:29 - sell like after this conversation like
102:32 - what are you guys
102:33 - thinking about selling like are you who
102:35 - here is interested in potentially
102:38 - using their knowledge to at some point
102:40 - maybe think about selling a course
102:45 - okay cool so a bunch of people here
102:48 - um awesome again there's many things you
102:51 - can sell
102:52 - one of the things for one of the things
102:54 - that's really easy is a course
102:57 - and i want to show you guys a platform
103:01 - you can use to do that
103:03 - and the platform that i recommend for
103:05 - you guys is
103:06 - kajabi that's the platform that we use
103:09 - okay
103:11 - so kajabi is why i like kajabi is it's
103:14 - going to be your website and where you
103:16 - sell your course
103:17 - all in one place so here and super easy
103:19 - to use so you can have your website
103:21 - for example i have cleverprogrammer.com
103:26 - this is hosted on kajabi so
103:29 - this is my website right and if i go to
103:31 - customer reviews blah blah blah
103:33 - full-on website and if you were a
103:35 - student and you wanted to access our
103:38 - courses
103:38 - you would just hit log in and be able to
103:40 - access the courses
103:42 - this is the only combination i found
103:45 - that combines
103:46 - websites and making courses so easy
103:49 - everything else doesn't have
103:53 - what this has there are a lot of
103:56 - alternatives out there
103:57 - teachable podia and then there are
104:01 - some other ones stay away from wordpress
104:04 - don't go to wordpress stay away
104:06 - run away you're gonna make your life
104:07 - hell you're gonna instead of trying to
104:09 - sell a course you're just gonna spend
104:10 - all your whole life away
104:12 - trying to make one [ __ ] plug-in work
104:14 - stay away
104:16 - um also you i would have recommended
104:19 - squarespace until i discovered that on
104:21 - kajabi you can have a website
104:22 - all in one place so instead of going
104:25 - through the nightmare of what we went
104:27 - through
104:27 - having a squarespace and then kajabi and
104:30 - then having to integrate them
104:31 - into one which was like pulling teeth
104:34 - it's like root doing root canals
104:35 - really hard painful once things get
104:38 - integrated over long term
104:40 - much better if you guys just start with
104:42 - one
104:43 - thing and then it makes your life easier
104:46 - cool
104:49 - so that's what i recommend for you guys
104:51 - to go ahead
104:52 - um sorry quick question yes do services
104:55 - like squarespace or the other one you
104:57 - mentioned
104:58 - do they offer ssl certificates or no
105:01 - i think almost everything offers uh ssl
105:04 - certificates
105:04 - i've been building my own for too long
105:08 - yeah so yeah yeah there's all the
105:11 - it's like the curse of the developer or
105:14 - like
105:14 - there we always want to build everything
105:16 - ourselves
105:17 - and it's like one of the worst things
105:19 - you can do because then you're spending
105:20 - all your time on making
105:24 - it then you're spending all your time on
105:26 - like developing a service that already
105:28 - really exists and not really teaching or
105:30 - helping people a lot you know how many
105:31 - people would come to my website and
105:32 - they're like
105:33 - this guy is a joker he didn't even code
105:36 - his own website
105:38 - i'm out full stack developer more like
105:42 - using a service for ten dollars a month
105:45 - i'm like i don't care like
105:48 - i again you just need half a percent of
105:51 - the people to agree with you
105:52 - everybody can not agree with you and
105:54 - that's okay so
105:56 - um go don't go that route you're gonna
105:59 - spend all your time coding it up then
106:01 - you're gonna spend
106:02 - all your time maintaining it instead of
106:03 - spending time on making content caring
106:05 - about your customers
106:06 - anything that pulls you away from caring
106:08 - about your customers or the potential
106:10 - people
106:11 - stay away from that not worth it okay so
106:14 - all of that stuff is already made um and
106:17 - then just pay for it
106:18 - that's the beautiful thing you can just
106:19 - pay for it and you get it
106:22 - i just dropped all the links in the
106:24 - comment also on the channel oh thank you
106:26 - thank you thank you thank you that's
106:27 - perfect so yeah direct text messaging
106:29 - community
106:30 - um i am a bleeding edge marketer
106:36 - i am using the community platform and
106:39 - it's it works for me uh i don't want you
106:43 - guys to get too hung up or crazy over
106:45 - every single thing as long as you have
106:47 - an email list you're solid
106:49 - if you want to use the community thing
106:51 - you can
106:52 - okay but it's just cause like i i'm just
106:54 - sharing with you guys the most advanced
106:55 - [ __ ] that i've discovered
106:56 - now that i'm using so you don't
107:00 - don't feel like you need to jump on this
107:02 - right away
107:09 - all right awesome uh cool so
107:13 - those are the resources that will help
107:15 - you get started
107:16 - in your journey those are the resources
107:18 - that hopefully will
107:20 - make your path much easier
107:23 - if you're about to go down this path
107:26 - because if you get started with the
107:28 - wrong things it's so painful
107:30 - i remember trying to sell like trying to
107:32 - put a course somewhere
107:34 - and nothing i would do would just
107:37 - i'm like guys i'm literally just trying
107:39 - to create something that i can sell
107:41 - why is it so hard why'd i have to coach
107:44 - it up why why'd you have to discover
107:45 - these plugins and so everything was
107:48 - really really complicated and it took
107:50 - all the time and energy from me actually
107:52 - making content
107:53 - me actually providing value so avoid
107:56 - those rabbit holes pick the simplest
107:57 - platforms from either convertkit for
107:59 - email kajabi for
108:01 - hosting course and website and it makes
108:03 - things
108:04 - really really easy and yeah it um and
108:07 - then for
108:09 - payment processors if you're trying to
108:10 - collect payment because at some point
108:13 - people are going to want to pay you um
108:15 - so you know whether you're making a
108:17 - course on finance or
108:18 - programming or you know or are on
108:21 - music you're going to have people pay
108:23 - you so the payment processor i recommend
108:25 - are two so here's what i recommend and
108:28 - you guys can write these down
108:31 - for payment
108:37 - you guys need one stripe
108:41 - which is the best payment processor so
108:43 - get a stripe you have stripe already
108:45 - stacy
108:46 - oh [ __ ] nice um and then the second
108:50 - payment processor you're gonna need is
108:53 - paypal
108:59 - okay so these are the two payment
109:01 - processors
109:03 - um that are the best with kajabi both of
109:06 - them will plug in and get integrated
109:08 - so i recommend using that making an
109:11 - account on it so then you can collect
109:13 - the payment
109:14 - okay but step one is you're gonna need a
109:16 - youtube
109:17 - account so if you don't have a youtube
109:18 - account go make that first
109:23 - wait service i opened up chat
109:26 - oh there it is yeah so i
109:30 - i mean i have tried thrive cart
109:32 - alexandros i've tried sam cart all of
109:35 - that you can
109:36 - i just go everything kajabi now like
109:38 - even my checkout
109:40 - i had um i had squarespace where my
109:43 - website was
109:44 - i had kajabi where my course was i had
109:49 - sam cart where i collected the payment
109:51 - from for checkout
109:53 - and then yeah i was like it was a
109:56 - [ __ ] nightmare to it was it was
110:00 - yeah it was just too many different
110:02 - texts and it was
110:03 - so hard to do any type of tracking
110:05 - anything that i want to do that was more
110:07 - advanced
110:07 - was a nightmare so i just completely
110:10 - went
110:11 - not that route uh later like it took us
110:14 - three to four years to completely switch
110:17 - now we're just all kajabi
110:18 - i even tried the clickfunnels route
110:20 - kajabi just
110:22 - makes everything so damn simple and for
110:24 - me
110:25 - simplicity i put on a pedestal and speed
110:28 - above everything um and so yeah
110:32 - that's what i would recommend just
110:35 - simplify it
110:36 - and make it easier for yourself
110:39 - all right guys so
110:42 - how was this guy how was this for you
110:44 - guys was this valuable for you guys
110:48 - yes yes too much value beautiful
110:53 - okay beautiful i'm glad that you guys
110:55 - got value out of it
110:56 - now guys what i want to do is i want to
110:59 - get into some questions and you guys
111:01 - want to do
111:01 - youtube roast today as well
111:05 - yeah okay dope awesome so
111:08 - let's take on some questions now is the
111:10 - time you can drop them in the chat or
111:12 - you can just speak them out loud
111:13 - go for it i want to take on new people
111:17 - so i want to make sure that some new
111:19 - people we're taking on for questions
111:21 - go ahead
111:25 - like i haven't heard anything from rob
111:27 - and rama
111:28 - even though you have an amazing
111:29 - background i always see it
111:31 - and i love it um i haven't heard
111:34 - anything from lawrence
111:35 - or corey or issa
111:38 - or alicia or raphael
111:43 - reynold so anybody who hasn't
111:46 - asked a question before i think it's a
111:47 - great time to ask one
111:49 - but go ahead guys
112:01 - i know we have questions guys you guys
112:03 - had your hands up a little bit earlier
112:07 - yeah i think the uh question
112:10 - in the chat from md is pretty good okay
112:12 - cool
112:13 - so md asks is it okay to put different
112:16 - niches
112:16 - into one channel or is it better to put
112:19 - them
112:20 - in different channels um
112:24 - i think it's better if you just have one
112:26 - niche and a channel
112:27 - that's usually it's gonna give you the
112:29 - best clearest growth
112:32 - you could try to do it but it's it's
112:34 - very hard like for example i tried to
112:36 - add personal development in my coding
112:37 - channel and it just
112:38 - always like sucked always like performed
112:41 - horribly so i kind of like just stopped
112:44 - completely
112:45 - i got there was a lot of stuff that was
112:46 - really meaningful to me on the personal
112:48 - development side
112:49 - but at some point i just kind of had to
112:51 - not talk about that
112:53 - same thing with i wanted to talk a lot
112:55 - about freelancing
112:57 - but there was just like no matter how
112:59 - much i wanted to talk about it not a lot
113:00 - of people wanted to listen to it because
113:02 - people just wanted to get
113:03 - jobs and so that was something that i
113:06 - would talk about but i started talking
113:08 - about it less on the channel
113:10 - um and i wanted to lean into where
113:11 - people were already listening to
113:14 - more of it and then help them with the
113:16 - thing that they needed help with
113:18 - so i think if you can niche down it's
113:21 - probably going to be better but don't
113:22 - again don't let that stop you from
113:24 - actually getting started
113:28 - all right beautiful
113:33 - so awesome can you show us which tool
113:36 - used to create or edit videos and how do
113:37 - you post it on
113:38 - youtube great question i use final cut
113:41 - pro to edit most of my content
113:45 - and if you want to use your phone to
113:46 - edit you can use an app called video
113:48 - leap it's amazing
113:53 - i have people using yive to create
113:55 - videos on youtube do you have an opinion
113:57 - about yive
113:58 - what tells you i've i'm looking it up
114:02 - right now
114:03 - your instant video empire huh
114:08 - the mass video marketing platform that
114:10 - launches your
114:11 - business success um
114:15 - i mean it looks funny to me but
114:18 - who knows it could be good
114:23 - you know so i don't know
114:26 - i i believe in just like using if you
114:29 - use final cut pro i think you're going
114:30 - to be good
114:32 - if you want to use another tool i'm not
114:33 - against it you
114:35 - i'm open to it you guys can check it out
114:37 - premiere is really good yeah so
114:38 - whether you want to use final cut or
114:40 - whatever use whatever you guys want i
114:42 - got on final cut
114:43 - i like it it's the easiest for me and i
114:46 - move on
114:46 - with it another thing i like about final
114:48 - cut is it's simple i believe it's way
114:50 - simpler than adobe premiere pro
114:53 - and so if you just want to not get let
114:55 - anything get in your way then i
114:56 - recommend just going with final cut
115:00 - um you were talking dimas says you were
115:03 - talking
115:04 - that we don't need to put money into ads
115:06 - before you get the money from content
115:07 - but how then attract viewers friends or
115:09 - friends
115:10 - trendy titles and picks and what else
115:13 - um good videos
115:17 - on good topics are gonna work
115:21 - and so yeah that's how you do it and
115:24 - it takes time but that's how you do it
115:26 - because at some point it has to be not
115:28 - your friends
115:29 - or friends or those people watching it
115:32 - and when those people start watching it
115:33 - then you're on the right track
115:38 - alicia i'm loving your setup bro you got
115:41 - you got the piano you got the mic
115:44 - what are you doing are you making
115:45 - youtube content right now or what's
115:47 - going on
115:48 - yeah appreciate it um so i don't have
115:50 - any questions but
115:51 - um i came across one of your ads on
115:53 - facebook and i clicked it and then you
115:55 - retargeted me and then you emailed me
115:56 - and i'm like okay this guy knows what
115:58 - he's doing so i just want to just chime
115:59 - in
116:00 - and say what's up keep killing it and uh
116:02 - thank you bro good stuff bro
116:03 - definitely oh that's sick i appreciate
116:05 - it man i appreciate that
116:07 - yeah i actually took a step back from
116:08 - youtube a little bit and
116:10 - just kind of wanted to really define my
116:12 - niche a little bit because i had a music
116:13 - channel as a rapper
116:15 - and then i had hit 10 000 subscribers
116:17 - and i'm like i started getting checks
116:18 - from youtube
116:19 - and i said let me try to really figure
116:21 - this youtube thing out and maybe go
116:23 - like go a different route because kind
116:25 - of like what a young man was saying it's
116:26 - kind of hard to get rich off of 99
116:28 - singles you know what i'm saying so now
116:30 - i'm just i'm going to focus on like
116:32 - content creation and monetization and
116:34 - just like education
116:35 - so that's kind of where i'm at with it
116:36 - right now so appreciate it
116:38 - awesome and what are you thinking right
116:40 - now like are you going to get back on
116:41 - youtube are you going to
116:42 - create content where's your mind at so
116:45 - my mind right now well first of all i
116:47 - just had to upgrade everything so i got
116:48 - cameras and mics and all that because i
116:50 - didn't have none of that so now i have
116:52 - like a setup
116:53 - so yeah i just want to like i don't know
116:54 - man maybe you can uh answer that maybe
116:56 - you can give me some advice on what you
116:58 - think would be the best route to go i
116:59 - love content creation i love
117:00 - teaching people so um maybe that's kind
117:03 - of where i'm at with it to be honest
117:04 - with you
117:05 - beautiful and then okay cool and uh
117:08 - what's your situation looking like
117:09 - for money are you
117:12 - are you making i'm imagining that you're
117:16 - making your living from somewhere
117:18 - outside of youtube
117:19 - yeah so i'm an insurance broker hate it
117:22 - though you know
117:23 - yeah you know i sell insurance i don't
117:25 - like talking about insurance all day so
117:27 - yeah but i've always been a pretty
117:28 - successful artist in orlando i'm pretty
117:30 - big so i do shows concerts and stuff
117:32 - like that
117:33 - but it's like that battle of your
117:34 - passion and then your paycheck so i'm
117:36 - like i want my passion to
117:38 - overtake my paycheck type stuff so
117:40 - that's where i'm at so yeah yeah
117:42 - so i don't know if you listen to my pa
117:44 - like
117:45 - between that that transition between
117:46 - 2016 to 2017
117:48 - where i dropped out and i i uh gave up
117:51 - all my clients i was making between 70
117:53 - to 100
117:54 - 000 a year and i gave up and i dropped
117:56 - it to zero
117:58 - because my my channel started taking off
118:00 - it showed me signs of taking off
118:02 - because i had 3 000 subscribers in that
118:05 - month
118:06 - and so i realized there's something here
118:09 - and i want to see what happens if i
118:10 - pursue it fully
118:11 - brother you've got a channel with 10 000
118:14 - plus subscribers
118:15 - there's a lot of [ __ ] people that

118:20 - nothing like where you're at but yeah
118:22 - um i'm gonna just try to like really go
118:24 - for it i think a a nice regimen is like
118:26 - maybe two to three videos a week
118:28 - dude and i i noticed that the algorithm
118:30 - really favors you when you're really
118:31 - putting content out consistently so i
118:33 - think that's
118:33 - my biggest thing just put out content
118:35 - and really just try to
118:36 - like find my niche and really try to see
118:39 - what people gravitate to and just do
118:40 - more of that basically
118:41 - please please like you already got
118:44 - something
118:45 - and you just need to keep going bro like
118:46 - just go just
118:48 - [ __ ] go like take out all that other
118:50 - voice bro and you just gotta go
118:51 - because dude you have you're on a
118:53 - winning streak
118:55 - don't quit when you're on a winning
118:57 - streak bro like
118:58 - don't quit so 11 5 that's
119:01 - 11 000 people voting like for me that
119:04 - means
119:05 - you have 11 000 people that voted for
119:07 - you that believe in you
119:10 - if you put those many people in one like
119:12 - stadium

119:15 - so
119:16 - if you got that much vote of confidence
119:18 - behind you
119:19 - you need to going you need to keep going
119:22 - and figure out how to monetize it bro

119:29 - and what i say because
119:31 - i want you to figure out how to make a
119:33 - living from this
119:35 - because if you could do that then i know
119:36 - you will quit your insurance job that
119:38 - you [ __ ] hate

122:15 - hard i'm telling you bro
122:16 - you please you gotta just go all into
122:19 - this dude
122:20 - you just gotta do that like i'm so
122:22 - certain of it
122:23 - that if you were like if we again like
122:25 - uh
122:26 - my brother like if i would imagine
122:28 - you're like my you're my brother or
122:29 - you're my
122:29 - good friend we're just sitting right
122:31 - next to each other i would tell you the
122:32 - same thing i told my brother
122:34 - and i literally told him i'm like the
122:36 - best thing that can happen to you
122:38 - is if you all of a sudden lost your job
122:42 - like literally today you lost your job
122:44 - and he would laugh and he'd be like haha
122:46 - yeah
122:46 - then he actually called me one day and
122:49 - he's like dude
122:50 - i lost my job and he was like having
122:52 - tears coming out of his eyes
122:54 - wow and i um i mean i heard him have
122:57 - tears coming out of his eyes because he
122:59 - was sniffling and [ __ ]
123:00 - so i put my phone on mute and i was just
123:02 - screaming and it was the happiest day of
123:04 - my life dude i was like
123:05 - laughing i was like yes i was like
123:08 - [ __ ] god bless like we've done it
123:10 - hallelujah like let's go
123:11 - then i up unmute and i was like bro that
123:13 - [ __ ] sucks
123:15 - yeah yeah and that was the day he
123:17 - started making content on youtube
123:19 - that was the day he actually got started
123:22 - fast forward one year from now
123:24 - and he has a whole business and he
123:25 - doesn't have to worry about anything
123:27 - else
123:28 - so like i really do believe that the
123:31 - best thing that can happen to you
123:32 - which is would suck and most people will
123:34 - be like oh don't say that
123:36 - i like the best thing that happened to
123:38 - you is if they either stop you from
123:40 - having that job like today or you stop
123:42 - that job
123:43 - and i believe in your channel and what
123:45 - you have so much because you already
123:46 - have a track record for it too
123:49 - that this would be the fastest path for
123:51 - you to grow like the most
123:52 - logical path honestly i think it's the

127:14 - i'm gonna work on a video and i'm just
127:17 - keep doing that or did you just do it
127:18 - whenever you had free time
127:20 - i did it when i had i i built my entire
127:24 - channel
127:25 - i mean the start of the channel in one
127:27 - in one hour windows
127:29 - so i would i would have uh full time i
127:31 - was like going to college and then i
127:33 - would go and do
127:34 - part-time like work and i would do a lot
127:36 - of
127:37 - freelancing work and then i would come
127:39 - home by
127:40 - 8 or 9 p.m and then i had a 9 p.m to 10
127:42 - p.m window so i'd leave home at 6 a.m
127:44 - come home at
127:45 - like 9ish p.m and then i would do
127:48 - between 9 to 10 p.m is when i would make
127:50 - my videos
127:51 - that's how i got got it started
127:55 - okay i see yep and then thank you and
127:58 - then
127:58 - two or three months in when i hit 3 000
128:00 - or 5 000 subscribers that's when i just
128:02 - went
128:03 - all i just quit i just went full in
128:06 - because i saw i'm like if i'm getting
128:07 - momentum and i hit three to five
128:08 - thousand subscribers there's something
128:10 - here and i just gotta go
128:14 - all right thank you very much yeah you
128:16 - got it
128:20 - man
128:23 - yeah i'm still looking at that channel
128:25 - and i'm excited it's like the
128:26 - how to monetize youtube channel fast
128:28 - that video like
128:30 - yeah okay all right cool so um
128:35 - music channel all right guys now start
128:37 - dropping your links and let me know what
128:38 - type of roast you're looking for i know
128:40 - some of you guys already dropped it
128:42 - um and then we'll start from there so i
128:44 - see stacy
128:45 - stacy what are you looking for
128:52 - i don't have to go first um i'll take a
128:55 - dark roast
128:56 - i mean yeah i'll be okay all right cool
128:59 - let's do it
129:00 - okay so um
129:04 - cool how to so i
129:07 - i like i like overall how the title
129:10 - looks
129:10 - i think when you when you get
129:13 - cute with titles sometimes they don't
129:15 - actually perform well because people
129:16 - don't know what you're talking
129:18 - about i know you're talking probably
129:19 - about git version control
129:21 - i have popped the squat in my recliner
129:24 - and i am ready
129:25 - to introduce you unless there's
129:28 - something wrong on my end i think the
129:30 - audio is
129:30 - really low on this video
129:34 - like i think yeah i think something
129:35 - happened to my audio yeah okay
129:38 - github that has this great platform
129:40 - that's better that allows you
129:43 - to save all your i'm saying that i was
129:46 - there to work to
129:47 - process okay
129:51 - great
129:55 - so i would edit like this part out where
129:59 - i think you're looking at something or
130:01 - trying to open
130:02 - up something so if it's a video and it's
130:05 - not a live stream
130:06 - then i would edit that out or i would
130:08 - just do better preparation
130:10 - in the start yeah i didn't do too much
130:14 - editing on this one
130:15 - okay so either do so here's this here's
130:18 - the thing right
130:19 - if you don't want to do editing then you
130:20 - got to do a lot of preparation and
130:22 - mentally put yourself in that state
130:25 - so like if i'm not gonna do if i'm not
130:28 - gonna do
130:29 - uh if if i want my
130:32 - people to shoot a video of me but i
130:34 - don't wanna do a lot of preparation
130:36 - then i get myself in the zone and then
130:38 - you just give me a topic
130:40 - right so you're just like so somebody
130:42 - give me some topic here
130:43 - any of you guys can give me a topic here
130:48 - giraffes giraffes what else
130:53 - git and github get in github okay so
130:58 - if i have preparation then that's great
131:00 - if i don't have preparation
131:01 - then i just got to go on the spot but be
131:03 - energetically wired so i'm like just
131:06 - going so then you don't need to edit it
131:08 - so then i just make myself so good that
131:10 - you don't need you don't need to edit it
131:12 - as much
131:13 - so then if it's like yo guys here are
131:14 - the top five things we're gonna learn
131:16 - about giraffes
131:17 - in this video now before we get started
131:20 - make sure you hit like
131:21 - subscribe to the channel this is me
131:22 - stacy joseph let's roll the intro
131:26 - that happens right
131:30 - i like alicia's laughing because that's
131:31 - probably his intro
131:36 - so either you have to like get your
131:39 - energy up
131:40 - and then really commit and go all in
131:43 - um that's one way of doing it or two
131:46 - just make sure you edit like if you're
131:47 - feeling like oh my energy is i'm like
131:49 - um now we're gonna open up github
131:53 - now we're going to open up this and then
131:54 - if you're looking at the thing and it's
131:55 - not prepared ahead of time
131:57 - so make sure you edit that part out so
131:58 - then the video is like
132:00 - paced well so if i'm watching it then
132:02 - i'm actually going to commit to watching
132:03 - you
132:04 - okay because it seems like okay you care
132:07 - you're not gonna waste my time you're
132:08 - gonna be respectful of my time
132:10 - especially the first stage especially
132:12 - the first
132:13 - few seconds are so important so if in
132:16 - the first few seconds you lose my
132:17 - attention
132:19 - you don't hook me i'm not going to get
132:20 - past i'm not going to get to the other
132:22 - parts
132:24 - and also to have others be able to
132:26 - collaborate with you
132:28 - don't tell me how i go about getting it
132:31 - so
132:34 - audio needs to improve um
132:37 - audio is like really bad it's really
132:40 - hard to
132:40 - understand what you're actually saying
132:43 - plus i think you're sitting
132:44 - away from the mic so i would recommend
132:46 - that you can invest
132:48 - in a might like a yeti and i think that
132:50 - will go a really far
132:51 - a long way
132:54 - if you're anything like me i need to
132:56 - know step by step what i need to do
133:01 - is my github
133:04 - after that if your mic
133:07 - is there i think this video is going to
133:09 - start popping like
133:11 - there's something about good audio that
133:12 - just makes things pop
133:14 - so even when you guys saw like alicia's
133:17 - video we put on before
133:18 - yes he has really great lighting yes he
133:20 - has a lot of those things but it's the
133:21 - mic that does a lot of the magic where
133:23 - all of a sudden you're like
133:24 - whoa like for example i want you guys to
133:27 - notice the difference between my voice
133:28 - right now
133:29 - and i want you to notice the difference
133:31 - between my voice right now
133:33 - did my voice my that is it like
133:36 - really an is is it much more annoying to
133:38 - hear me now
133:40 - like it's almost like this sad sound far
133:42 - away yeah it's not equally
133:44 - echoey far away like weird right all of
133:47 - that
133:48 - and then all of a sudden i'm like how's
133:51 - it going guys
133:52 - what is up right it is just howard's
133:55 - turn like hey how's it going
133:56 - right yeah yeah so audio makes
134:00 - the most difference the most difference
134:03 - um
134:04 - and then yeah so i would focus on the
134:06 - video part of it later other than that
134:08 - i sometimes just skim through to see how
134:10 - i feel about the video
134:11 - so here when i see visually things
134:13 - changing that's a really good sign
134:16 - i would increase the energy in the
134:19 - intro because that there's there's no
134:21 - energy in the intro
134:23 - like and here it's almost like you
134:25 - you're like you forgot that you even had
134:27 - a camera on or something for a few
134:28 - seconds
134:30 - so that part is important other than
134:32 - that you're good
134:34 - add some visuals so when you say github
134:36 - github logo should pop up
134:38 - like have a github logo or a github
134:40 - image right there
134:42 - that's gonna be a better way to go so
134:45 - that's what i have for you okay okay
134:48 - cool all right let's go um
134:53 - all right i'm gonna go with muktum
134:55 - ahmaktum are you here
134:57 - yes because okay dope all right let's go
134:59 - with this one
135:00 - and see what's going on here hey guys
135:04 - welcome back to the great
135:06 - start i hope you are doing well
135:10 - so in this video i'm going to show you
135:12 - great you're getting to the point pretty
135:13 - quickly
135:14 - you how can you write python code into
135:17 - visual studio code
135:19 - great i already know what's happening
135:21 - here i'm not a fan of the title of the
135:23 - video to be honest python with vs code
135:26 - like that doesn't make that much sense
135:28 - to me i would probably do something
135:29 - along the lines of like
135:31 - um how to
135:34 - like visual studio code
135:38 - setup with python or like how to set up
135:40 - visual studio code
135:42 - using python something along the lines
135:44 - of something that's a lot more popular
135:46 - and people are already searching up and
135:47 - looking up
135:48 - when people have to read your title and
135:50 - go um what is that
135:52 - when you have to explain it to somebody
135:54 - it's red flag
135:56 - that's a danger anytime you have to
135:57 - explain something to somebody
136:01 - red flag so make sure it's something
136:02 - that immediately either yet or something
136:04 - is already popular
136:05 - when you made this title did you do the
136:07 - research of seeing what other titles
136:09 - like this are popular
136:12 - okay so that's what i would do and then
136:15 - i would uh then i would post up with
136:16 - that title
136:18 - python.org website i'm going is
136:20 - installed
136:21 - your energy is good you flow through it
136:23 - fast i like it check whether it is
136:25 - python and check it out
136:27 - go to vs code the vs code looks like
136:30 - this
136:31 - so you can save it as need of semicolon
136:35 - i think you have potential i can even
136:37 - see you have 16 to one dislike you're
136:39 - already over a thousand subscribers
136:41 - uh so it tells me you've probably been
136:43 - doing it for a minute
136:45 - i can see your energy and how you move
136:47 - with it so that's really really good
136:50 - i think just do more of this if you can
136:53 - invest in a better mic i don't know if
136:55 - you have a yeti
136:57 - if you can get something like a yeti go
136:58 - with that i think your
137:00 - thumbnails are really bad
137:04 - thumbnails i think you have to work on
137:07 - okay so i'll tell you the thumbnails
137:09 - that i think are actually good
137:12 - and uh so this one is
137:15 - okay uh this one is a little bit
137:19 - better um
137:23 - this one starts to get too much like i
137:26 - don't care about bai
137:27 - who and i don't care about learn with
137:29 - muktum so
137:30 - anything that makes it look like a flyer
137:32 - remove that
137:33 - that's an awful thumbnail um
137:38 - let's see most of the thumbnails they're
137:40 - really busy like you're you're
137:42 - putting a whole diagram on them so
137:43 - they're like too much there's too much
137:45 - going on
137:46 - hard to read model channels that are
137:48 - doing well make thumbnails like them
137:50 - that's the simplest way i can make it
137:52 - and it doesn't matter if you're in
137:53 - freaking india
137:54 - or sri lanka or canada or u.s it doesn't
137:57 - matter like
137:58 - this stuff to make things look good it
138:00 - doesn't cost you [ __ ] it's free
138:02 - just look at what the people who have
138:05 - the best channels
138:06 - just make it look like theirs then
138:08 - immediately it'll look good and it won't
138:10 - look cheesy and it won't look weird
138:11 - and it'll actually make people want to
138:13 - click on it okay
138:15 - also there's a free tool called
138:17 - canva.com yes
138:18 - and they there's uh there's a bunch of
138:20 - really good templates
138:21 - for youtube that's what i use for for
138:24 - the video that
138:25 - kazzy's about to roast me on nice
138:28 - all right cool so that's your roast
138:31 - let's go to frank
138:35 - hey everyone have you been wondering
138:37 - what git and github are
138:39 - i'm going to show you oh [ __ ] one tool
138:42 - for developers to use
138:43 - to collaborate with code all right our
138:46 - first step
138:47 - that's all you gave me get in github huh
138:48 - this is going to be going to github.com
138:51 - so open up your google chrome browser
138:53 - let's go right to it
138:55 - okay so something i want to tell you
138:57 - frank
138:58 - is i mean you you got it this channel is
139:01 - gonna go
139:01 - this channel is gonna grow okay
139:03 - something i would tell you um
139:07 - you're holding back emotionally
139:11 - okay i can see the fire in you and you
139:13 - kind of want to go
139:14 - but you're almost like holding back and
139:16 - being kind
139:18 - let that go and just be more like a
139:22 - little bit more on the voice
139:23 - so like i would i would just a little
139:26 - bit on the
139:27 - higher louder projection and i would
139:29 - just like go
139:30 - so like you're so close to it but it's
139:33 - like
139:33 - you know even the little bit like what
139:35 - is git and github like i would just go
139:37 - yo what is github yo this is your boy
139:40 - frank
139:41 - what is git and github you're like that
139:43 - even on the calls
139:45 - you know like you go crazy even on the
139:47 - calls on
139:48 - video when you go way overboard that's
139:51 - when you actually look normal
139:53 - it's really weird
139:56 - right so like even you guys paying
139:58 - attention to me on this call
140:00 - when i actually go overboard and i'm
140:02 - speaking really loud because that's not
140:04 - how i'm speaking when i'm with my
140:05 - girlfriend and we're just sitting
140:07 - eating like here's how i actually will
140:09 - speak with her right i'm like
140:10 - hey how's your day going though yeah so
140:13 - like this
140:14 - crazy thing happened the other day and
140:16 - you know we were on a call with
140:18 - these people on the zoom and it was such
140:20 - a cool call like i just loved it
140:22 - but you guys see how that doesn't
140:23 - actually sound normal
140:25 - to you guys on zoom it's like you guys
140:27 - lose energy and attention
140:29 - so i have to actually go way above and
140:32 - beyond
140:34 - on the call for it to actually sound
140:36 - normal
140:37 - so same thing on the youtube end i would
140:40 - push
140:41 - there's something holding you back i
140:42 - would push that way harder
140:44 - so then it actually sounds like really
140:46 - good and step is gonna be going to
140:48 - github.com
140:49 - i like that little like i like the
140:51 - design of the background
140:53 - the image that you have and then i like
140:54 - how what is getting github like
140:56 - how it's moving towards me so open up
140:59 - your google chrome browser

141:24 - there's something beautiful about it
141:25 - that it like
141:26 - hooks you there's something about it
141:28 - that when you
141:29 - listen you actually want to stay there
141:32 - just for a second longer
141:33 - so that energy is where i want you to

142:06 - disposed
142:08 - something is with the sound there's a
142:10 - lot of hum in the background
142:12 - so i would focu i would reduce the gain
142:15 - to zero
142:18 - all right and let's let's make the

142:34 - dude
142:36 - let's verify that we're a real human
142:38 - let's pick the spiral
142:39 - i know um i know how it feels when
142:42 - you're making content and
142:44 - and yeah i've been through a lot of
142:45 - those sessions where i'm making content
142:47 - it just feels very contrived and like
142:50 - so sometimes just like loosen up a
142:52 - little bit before making it
142:54 - uh but you have to put your uh
142:57 - reps in so there's no way out of it so
143:00 - that's okay
143:01 - okay let's cut our profile here and here
143:04 - you see
143:04 - this is a repository called free code
143:07 - camp
143:08 - excellent repository see they have
143:11 - a bunch of different things here a bunch
143:13 - of different files
143:14 - it's a very large project here you see
143:17 - there's a lot of people watching the
143:18 - project that means
143:19 - dope so this is you know i love this
143:22 - you're gonna you're gonna improve so
143:24 - fast
143:24 - you're gonna get so good just keep
143:26 - putting it out and hitting public
143:28 - publish on it and then go and do another
143:29 - one another one this reminds me of like
143:32 - remember when i started my first videos
143:36 - and you can see that there's just
143:37 - something holding me back
143:40 - you know what i'm talking about right
143:44 - yeah i saw it um and so it's it's it's
143:47 - literally like that
143:48 - where it was something holding me back
143:50 - almost for a bunch of videos and then
143:53 - i started coming into my own and then
143:55 - i'm just like
143:56 - i'm just going this is what i want to
143:57 - teach and i'm going to go so keep making
144:00 - the
144:00 - these videos and keep making more and
144:02 - more of them so
144:04 - increase your quantity and just in a
144:06 - loving way i want you to
144:08 - focus on increasing your energy that you
144:11 - come in with
144:12 - like commit to coming in with your like
144:14 - entire energy
144:15 - see what i'm saying 100 100 i recorded
144:18 - this video at midnight and it's
144:19 - probably better to do it daytime so i
144:21 - could go real crazy yeah yeah yeah
144:23 - have the neighbors kill me yeah i mean
144:26 - yeah
144:26 - i love it though hey this is exactly
144:28 - like you're saying this is like exercise
144:30 - it's like practice you know i'm taking
144:32 - everything to heart i'm writing
144:34 - everything down
144:34 - what's up with that thumbnail though i
144:36 - took your your advice on the thumbnail
144:38 - oh let me see the thumbnail okay so
144:40 - let's go here i like the yellow
144:42 - oh [ __ ] i love the thumbnail nice job on
144:45 - it
144:46 - that's looking really really clean so
144:48 - great job
144:49 - on this the reason why i actually say to
144:52 - put your face on the right hand side
144:54 - sometimes
144:55 - is because this uh watermark actually
144:58 - blocks a lot of what's happening here
145:01 - so um it's it's like a actual problem
145:04 - like it's
145:05 - [ __ ] huge you don't see it right now
145:07 - because i'm on your video but like if
145:09 - i'm on my
145:10 - phone and it's in the recommended that
145:12 - watermark is
145:13 - huge there's like bunch of stuff that
145:15 - you could have there like for example
145:16 - the github logo is hidden
145:20 - so that github logo so that's why
145:23 - i would put the face here and then i
145:26 - would put the stuff on the left hand
145:28 - side
145:29 - that's one thing another thing is
145:31 - there's no need for a youtube logo in
145:33 - this
145:34 - so i would remove the youtube logo
145:38 - um the github the get in github logo is
145:42 - what i would have that pops
145:44 - a lot more so i would do this where
145:48 - okay i don't know if you could just try
145:49 - to follow me okay i'd move your face
145:51 - here
145:52 - i put the git and github logos like here
145:56 - and then i would put your text here
146:02 - kind of like that and
146:06 - no youtube and make sure the git and
146:07 - github logo have colors because they
146:09 - have such amazing colors that pop out
146:11 - you know that octocat or whatever
146:13 - it's it's really nice it pops so
146:17 - i would yeah i would put that there and
146:18 - that would be great but this is
146:20 - but other than that i mean it's a great
146:21 - thumbnail great thumbnail
146:26 - so nice job bro this is amazing

147:43 - all right we'll move on to the next one
147:45 - uh
147:46 - let's go with red red diane
147:52 - yo what's up this is radion from top
147:54 - notch programmer and today i'm going to
147:56 - share with you an instagram dm bot so
147:58 - this bot is
147:58 - build it using python programming
148:00 - language and
148:02 - this bot can send messages to a list
148:05 - usernames
148:06 - on instagram you can use this bot for
148:08 - influencing
148:09 - for advertisement to get jobs or to
148:12 - increase your followers
148:13 - before watching this video please make
148:15 - sure to like and subscribe so we can
148:18 - break this youtube algorithm and we can
148:19 - share this video
148:21 - oh [ __ ] let's get right into it
148:25 - that's what i'm talking about bro that
148:27 - is a massive improvement you need to do
148:29 - is just to go to my github repository
148:32 - and
148:33 - clone we have to install holder uh let's
148:36 - extract here
148:38 - oh man i i want to talk about like the
148:41 - fury of the bangers
148:42 - i don't i never i haven't talked about
148:44 - it yet
148:46 - let's make and uh
148:49 - here and as you can see it log in
148:52 - successful and now we send this
148:54 - message to the first user okay cool
148:58 - uh make sure that random [ __ ] that you
149:00 - have in users text that that's clean
149:03 - so i don't know if these are the names
149:05 - of the users
149:06 - but make sure that there's not dumb [ __ ]
149:09 - in here
149:09 - because you're gonna get either
149:12 - downvoted or
149:13 - banned on youtube so just be careful
149:15 - about that
149:16 - okay so that's one thing i would just be
149:17 - careful about other i
149:19 - i just imagined probably was either a
149:21 - mistake or you were like scraping some
149:23 - username and somebody just had a random
149:25 - username and that's okay
149:27 - um what i would say for the rest of it
149:30 - intro is really really good okay so i
149:32 - love how this intro is and i want you
149:34 - guys to have intros like this too
149:36 - especially if you're showing people
149:37 - how to make something the best way to
149:40 - show that is just demonstrate it in the
149:41 - start
149:42 - yo what's up this is radion from top
149:44 - notch programmer and today i'm going to
149:45 - share with you an instagram dm bot so
149:47 - this one is
149:48 - build it using python programming
149:50 - language that's great so great intro on
149:52 - that
149:54 - um that i would be careful about like
149:57 - you're just like breathing into the mic
150:00 - you're not really talking
150:04 - okay let's extract here
150:09 - okay now is is extracted we can delete
150:11 - the zip file
150:14 - paste yeah so just i think like just
150:17 - overall flow of it i would make it a
150:19 - little bit faster so
150:21 - as long as you're speaking or you're
150:23 - giving some tips
150:24 - even in those small moments that's what
150:26 - makes a really big difference
150:28 - so there's very subtle things but they
150:30 - make a big difference so for example
150:33 - if you guys are watching my tutorials
150:35 - and i'm talking about
150:38 - moving this scrape bot or opening this
150:41 - folder
150:42 - i won't just be like
150:49 - and then clicking on this i i will
150:51 - actually be saying like
150:53 - all right guys so now we're gonna unzip
150:55 - the ig
150:56 - bot so i'm gonna go ahead and double
150:58 - click it and unzip it
151:00 - all right now it's unzipping it'll be
151:02 - unzipped in a second and as soon as
151:03 - that's done i'm going to move it over
151:04 - into the scrape bot and then as soon as
151:06 - the unzip
151:06 - happens i go all right now that that's
151:08 - over let's go ahead and put it into here
151:11 - so that part is really important to be
151:14 - able to
151:15 - have the flow of it going the entire
151:18 - time
151:19 - if you can keep the flow going it helps
151:22 - people
151:22 - get through everything okay so that's
151:25 - one thing i would improve here other
151:27 - than that
151:27 - great job radiant and big improvement
151:31 - from
151:31 - yesterday guys everybody give it up for
151:33 - red diane
151:38 - awesome brother love it love it love it
151:42 - okay
151:43 - let's go ahead for the next person and
151:47 - remember guys
151:48 - day five just want to share this with
151:51 - you guys
151:52 - day five of the challenge is tomorrow
151:54 - and what are we doing on day five of the
151:55 - challenge
151:58 - creating a blueprint yes you're creating
152:01 - yeah
152:01 - you're creating your very own blueprint
152:03 - for your own youtube channel
152:05 - all right so that's what we're gonna be
152:06 - doing and then day six i'm gonna have a
152:08 - surprise for you guys
152:10 - i shared with you guys a little bit
152:11 - about the launch of the course
152:13 - and that i can talk to you guys about it
152:15 - on day six
152:16 - and how it might even be possible for
152:18 - you guys to join so we're gonna talk
152:20 - about that
152:21 - more tomorrow at the end of tomorrow but
152:23 - right now i want to keep going through
152:25 - everybody's youtube channels
152:27 - so let's keep going through that all
152:29 - right so we got alex
152:31 - alexandros cool let's go
152:38 - i love it because you come to all of our
152:40 - you you would come to all of our youtube
152:42 - live streams so that was super awesome
152:45 - all right so let's see here
152:49 - are you there alexandros yes okay
152:53 - i'm here beautiful
152:57 - so um what i see here and you're a monk
153:00 - so i'm gonna be nice to you
153:02 - yeah it was a little
153:06 - draft effort so not so prepared
153:09 - okay that's fine you know but you know
153:12 - about what it's better then
153:14 - yes i know several improvements can be
153:16 - made so for example the sound can be
153:18 - improved
153:19 - yes no no no no that's not what i was
153:20 - saying i was saying it's even if
153:22 - even even though it's in draft it's
153:25 - better than 99
153:27 - of the people who don't even have one
153:29 - video
153:32 - so you gotta congratulate yourself on
153:34 - the fact that you actually have a video
153:35 - okay
153:36 - so that's really really good so now
153:38 - let's go through it
153:40 - hello alexander's tuition friends and
153:43 - welcome to our cute
153:44 - python tutorial from pandas
153:48 - it's kind of ridiculous how much sound
153:50 - makes a difference
153:52 - when you watch this you're like there's
153:54 - so much wrong with this
153:56 - but if if he didn't change
153:59 - anything else and the only thing he
154:01 - changed is audio
154:03 - and just reduced his gain to zero put
154:06 - the mic
154:06 - really close to him and spoke that alone
154:10 - would make this video like completely
154:12 - watchable
154:13 - just that one thing alone like actually
154:15 - pay attention to sound right now right
154:17 - function based on slides by the
154:19 - instagram
154:20 - profile azure will so because of there's
154:24 - a lot of sound in the back
154:26 - if just that one thing improves almost
154:29 - everything
154:30 - improves so let's keep going now through
154:31 - this you can find the slides on this
154:33 - link i like how you have stuff prepared
154:37 - and organized alexandro so good job on
154:39 - that because you're respecting people's
154:41 - time
154:41 - i like that you have preparation behind
154:44 - it
154:45 - um this slide so
154:49 - so as you can see it says pandas shift
154:51 - function
154:52 - shifting grows there's kids in the back
154:55 - there's like all kinds of craziness
154:57 - so that's where this is the number one
155:00 - way to make your videos
155:01 - sound professional and something worth
155:02 - watching just
155:04 - audio i cannot emphasize enough invest
155:07 - in
155:07 - audio that automatically makes so many
155:09 - things better
155:14 - oh dude you are like
155:18 - you are actually providing valuable [ __ ]
155:22 - it reminds me of the garyvee tick tock
155:24 - where he told people he's like it's easy
155:26 - he's like open your camera and he's like
155:27 - just say valuable [ __ ]
155:29 - and people started making all these tick
155:30 - tocks where literally all they do when
155:32 - they open their cameras they just open
155:34 - the camera they go
155:35 - valuable [ __ ] so it reminded me of that
155:38 - tick tock and i was laughing
155:40 - but this is really valuable i think
155:44 - that if you just keep going you're gonna
155:46 - actually do well
155:49 - the only things for you um
155:52 - see if you can replace this with your
155:54 - actual face
155:55 - yes if you can't
155:59 - then maybe then just make the whole
156:00 - screen coding
156:02 - okay um other than that brother
156:05 - the only other advice i'll give you is
156:07 - keep going and make more
156:09 - you're making good content you're
156:10 - providing value people
156:12 - always want to go where they can get
156:14 - value from so
156:15 - improve your audio and then just make
156:18 - more content that's the best advice i
156:20 - got for you okay brother
156:22 - thank you very much you got it nice all
156:24 - right
156:25 - you got it take care uh yazid
156:30 - dark roast a bit of sugar
156:33 - uh kevin yeah yeah
156:36 - just a minute i'm uploading the video
156:38 - here just four minutes
156:40 - okay cool if you can go to the next all
156:42 - right all right got it got it got it
156:44 - all right xavier king let's go xavier's
156:47 - got his whole website up
156:50 - all right so kings
156:54 - oh okay i see it redirects me to it like
156:56 - that
156:57 - cool what yeah looks better than the
157:01 - garbly [ __ ] at the top youtube link yeah
157:03 - got it
157:05 - all right so
157:16 - okay so my first thing is what is
157:18 - happening
157:20 - i think i'm mostly confused
157:24 - so is this supposed to be like a
157:26 - lifestyle vlog or something
157:29 - uh not quite i am in the process of
157:32 - converting
157:33 - a school bus into a tiny house on wheels
157:36 - oh [ __ ]
157:37 - the process of the build okay and
157:40 - are there other people who do similar
157:42 - things
157:44 - yeah are there other people that are
157:46 - popular doing similar things
157:49 - um i believe still i know i've seen a
157:52 - bit where i was looking into it
157:53 - okay so
157:56 - so i see here watch this before you
158:00 - start a bus conversion
158:02 - i would literally i would just type in
158:04 - schooly and i would look at like what
158:06 - people are doing and what thumbnails are
158:08 - crushing it
158:09 - and that's what i would model the [ __ ]
158:12 - out of
158:14 - yeah so the number one thing is that you
158:16 - need to work on
158:17 - i cannot emphasize all your need your
158:20 - time and energy needs to go to like
158:21 - learning this
158:23 - and by learning this it literally means
158:25 - you type in one word and you take one
158:27 - thumbnail type of idea
158:28 - and one title and that's it you're good
158:32 - yeah so popular titles are really
158:34 - important that's
158:35 - really important i call them bangers
158:39 - all your channels need bangers you all
158:42 - need to [ __ ] make bangers if you
158:43 - don't make bangers your channels will
158:45 - never grow people are always like why
158:47 - are my channels not growing you don't
158:48 - have bangers
158:50 - so you gotta make bangers that's the
158:53 - only way you get
158:54 - found ever i have 490 videos on my
158:58 - youtube channel i have 830 000 plus
159:01 - subscribers on the clever programmer
159:02 - youtube channel
159:05 - there are only 10 videos that bring me
159:08 - all of those subscribers literally 10
159:12 - videos
159:13 - that bring me 800 000 subscribers
159:18 - and then the other 400 whatever like
159:21 - they bring value and all that [ __ ]
159:23 - so you need things that help you get
159:25 - discovered a lot of you want to find out
159:27 - you guys want to find out right how you
159:29 - get discovered on youtube guys yes or no
159:32 - yeah if you want to find out how to get
159:34 - discovered on youtube you got to make
159:36 - bangers
159:37 - when we looked at alicia he dropped a
159:40 - banger on the 21st
159:42 - 21 day breakfast those types of titles
159:45 - are bangers if you can nail that video
159:47 - another one that's a banger was his how
159:50 - to monetize youtube channels in 2020
159:52 - that's a banger title
159:54 - that'll work and it did and he got 12
159:57 - 000 views
159:57 - then he had one on birthday quarantine
160:00 - and that one did nothing
160:01 - because it's not a banger nobody's
160:03 - talking about that
160:04 - so until he has a huge subscriber base
160:08 - they're never gonna find out about that
160:10 - birthday quarantine video
160:12 - see what i'm saying so bangers is how
160:14 - you get discovered
160:16 - then all your other content is watched
160:17 - by people that
160:19 - you know discover you
160:23 - okay cool so that's why you guys gotta
160:26 - so number one thing is i would take
160:28 - something like this make a video on it
160:30 - um big titles whatever these big ones
160:33 - are schooly home conversion bus life
160:35 - touring lockdown
160:36 - what the hell these people do i would
160:37 - make a video similar to this
160:39 - all right let me go to your channel now
160:44 - all right schooly so now look at the
160:46 - comparison right schooly conversion part
160:48 - one
160:49 - and if you look here
160:53 - watch this before you start a bus
160:54 - conversion that's pretty cool one
160:56 - um seven regrets schooling home
161:00 - conversion
161:01 - so i would do something like this and i
161:02 - probably would not
161:04 - necessarily do part one also
161:07 - i think i wouldn't have this because
161:09 - nobody knows this or cares about this
161:13 - like for example if i'm about to watch
161:16 - this video
161:18 - i can understand everything and i even i
161:21 - can click on it
161:23 - if i'm about to watch your video
161:26 - i have no idea what i'm getting into
161:29 - because these are terms only you know
161:31 - and then this is something very specific
161:33 - to only you
161:35 - yeah i would actually recommend watching
161:38 - either the part 0 or part 7.
161:41 - i don't i think that this one's more of
161:43 - a time lapse of my trip to go get the
161:45 - bus
161:45 - cool i think what would be better is
161:47 - probably if you just made it all into
161:49 - one video
161:51 - okay um okay let's go to where part zero
161:54 - is
161:56 - hi my name is xavier king i'm 19 and i'm
161:59 - about to embark on a trip
162:01 - to buy i like that you're playing with
162:03 - storytelling i admire that that's really
162:06 - good
162:06 - putting emotional music playing with it
162:09 - in the start sometimes even
162:11 - when is caitlyn on here today caitlyn
162:13 - are you on
162:16 - no so even when caitlyn was on here
162:18 - yesterday right she tried a joke
162:20 - it didn't really work in the video that
162:23 - much
162:24 - but if she adds a little bit of music a
162:27 - little bit of this it
162:28 - will work so first it's important for
162:30 - her to take
162:31 - shots at it and then eventually she can
162:33 - actually make it work so same thing here
162:36 - i like that you're playing with
162:37 - storytelling there then there are times
162:39 - where you'll
162:39 - actually be really be able to make it
162:41 - hit home the bus i will be converting
162:43 - into a schoolie
162:45 - in fact there's a good chance this video
162:47 - will go live
162:49 - uh while i'm on my trip to el paso
162:53 - amazing look at the camera
162:56 - yeah okay having a little bit of an
162:58 - issue with that
162:59 - why is that uh i was recording it with
163:02 - my phone
163:03 - so i was trying to look at the screen
163:05 - and then the script that was right next
163:07 - to it
163:08 - and i never really looked at the camera
163:09 - that was right between them oh i see
163:12 - now how did i get to this point
163:16 - well first glance you'll see my dad gave
163:19 - me this idea
163:20 - back in february uh damn
163:23 - when i was looking for something to do
163:26 - most
163:26 - fun class i stuff we made association of
163:30 - turners
163:31 - a woodturning use autodesk
163:35 - january
163:38 - so i'm liking i'm liking your b-roll i'm
163:42 - liking all of that i think
163:43 - a few important things one look at the
163:45 - camera to mike
163:46 - i cannot emphasize mike enough mic is so
163:49 - important the same video will actually
163:51 - feel a lot better with the mic
163:53 - three you are reading too much off of a
163:58 - script to the point where it's making
163:59 - you a robot
164:00 - so i cannot connect with you as a human
164:02 - being if you
164:04 - read too much off of a script i want you
164:06 - to also
164:07 - speak to me a little bit okay that's a
164:09 - that's a important
164:11 - uh thing other than that i think
164:15 - for this is for everybody you all need
164:17 - to like actually
164:18 - pick banger titles and then like go all
164:21 - in on those videos those are
164:22 - how your channel is going to really
164:24 - really grow for clever programmer
164:26 - for my clever programmer channel i know
164:28 - my banger titles like the top five
164:30 - programming languages to learn
164:32 - um you know another one is like how to
164:36 - become a programmer in three months what
164:39 - are some other ones frankie that are
164:41 - like that always bang
164:43 - top four dying programming languages
164:52 - the crash courses that we put up they're
164:53 - always like they banged
164:58 - so so like there's a list of them
165:02 - and for you in your schooly you need to
165:04 - go and look at the schooly [ __ ] that's
165:06 - banging
165:07 - you can if you just keep getting unique
165:10 - with your
165:11 - um content and you don't actually look
165:13 - at what
165:14 - works you're never going to get found
165:16 - bro it's very unfortunate you're going
165:18 - to be 300 videos in
165:19 - with zero subscribers i've seen it
165:21 - happen to people they [ __ ] make 300
165:23 - videos
165:23 - nothing ever gets found nobody ever
165:25 - knows them and it sucks
165:27 - so i want you to look at the top content
165:30 - then i want you to model the [ __ ] out of
165:32 - it
165:33 - model for you especially because you got
165:36 - a long way to go
165:38 - model it really closely that's how
165:40 - you're going to get really good
165:42 - you're going to pick up so much by
165:44 - emulating them
165:46 - yeah i was actually modeling when you
165:49 - search up schooly build
165:51 - because there's a lot of people who post
165:53 - the same type of things where they're
165:54 - doing the full build process
165:56 - and different stuff uh schooly build
166:00 - yeah um so
166:04 - which one is it where any of the
166:07 - different playlists there
166:08 - they go through all the different videos
166:10 - so okay so i'll click this one right
166:12 - here is that fine
166:14 - yeah yeah
166:18 - that looks like it's before but i was
166:21 - planning on doing some of those down too
166:26 - so like what's cool about this is
166:27 - they're telling me what
166:29 - is going to be happening when and what
166:31 - times
166:33 - yeah right so like you can do that if
166:36 - you
166:37 - added all that in your video and then
166:38 - you could give me that and then it would
166:40 - make it a banger video yes it would make
166:42 - it a banker video
166:45 - [ __ ] my life
166:52 - all right
166:55 - up into hers or your own thing
166:58 - you need to maximize your space inside
167:00 - of a butt has some little clothes
167:01 - storage
167:02 - this is where so surprisingly we
167:05 - actually
167:06 - live again and so we're just really
167:08 - looking forward to going west and seeing
167:10 - everything that it has to offer we love
167:12 - the snowboarding
167:14 - dope so this is a good video and he's
167:16 - showing us like what's happening
167:18 - throughout it all of it is packed in one
167:19 - video rather than part one two three
167:21 - four
167:22 - parts don't work that well on youtube
167:24 - people want that one video to just be
167:26 - self-contained
167:27 - that's why when we would do these like
167:29 - eight hour live streams
167:31 - we wouldn't break it up into part one
167:33 - part two part three part four building
167:34 - facebook
167:35 - we would just have one video and you
167:38 - would just build facebook in there
167:39 - so i would recommend going that route
167:41 - okay all right we're gonna move on to
167:42 - the next one just because i wanna give
167:44 - more time to people
167:46 - yeah um awesome love it
167:49 - cool quasi harman says how did you set
167:52 - up your mic my current setup is yeti
167:53 - voice meter rtx voice
167:55 - okay cool yeah if you got that i think
167:57 - you should be good
167:58 - my just mine is uh i have a shure sm7b
168:02 - connected to a road caster pro and
168:06 - that's
168:06 - kind of it on my setup
168:10 - mark cinematic says i want a
168:12 - constructive rose please do i need to
168:13 - appear
168:14 - more human okay let's take a look
168:26 - yes that's a
168:29 - that's i didn't realize how inhuman i
168:31 - appeared until today
168:33 - yes it i mean it's one of it seems like
168:35 - one of those channels that
168:36 - you know have uh like like i know what
168:39 - these types of channels are like right
168:41 - like i'll go here and i'll click like
168:43 - i'll do trap instrumental uh
168:46 - stuff like that and i'll click it and
168:48 - then i'll go and
168:49 - watch and i'll watch some of these you
168:52 - know this one i like with the rick and
168:53 - morty one that's pretty sick
168:55 - oh my [ __ ] god all right all right
168:58 - all good just [ __ ] ads man god
169:02 - they just give me anxiety i would say
169:05 - bro for you
169:07 - let me let me hear this
169:12 - um i'm actually moving away from trap i
169:15 - didn't delete that video based off of
169:16 - yesterday you said don't delete anything
169:18 - so okay
169:22 - same okay
169:25 - cool don't delete anything yeah i love
169:28 - trap
169:30 - oh [ __ ] that's pretty cool
169:40 - that's sick i love that um okay
169:43 - so i think for these types of channels
169:45 - to really explode
169:46 - one of the hacks that i've seen is if
169:48 - you had a live stream that's just going
169:50 - permanently
169:51 - i've seen a lot of channels do that and
169:53 - they do really well with it
169:55 - that's one you know a service that
169:57 - offers that or would that be something i
169:59 - set up
169:59 - i have no idea about that i've never
170:01 - really looked into it
170:03 - uh you could you could call restream.io
170:07 - something like that
170:08 - no no no i mean that's not going to
170:10 - allow you to like
170:11 - he's looking to stream forever
170:13 - permanently like
170:15 - so yeah like lo-fi hip-hop radio yeah re
170:17 - restream is just to be able to stream to
170:19 - multiple platforms so
170:20 - that's all that's all that is with
170:22 - restream you would literally i think
170:24 - need to dedicate
170:25 - one computer or one laptop to just
170:28 - streaming permanently
170:30 - okay um so you can have it like a
170:33 - cheaper computer that just permanently
170:35 - does that forever
170:36 - that could be what's up i'm sorry for
170:38 - interrupting but um with this
170:40 - infinite stream thing would that be like
170:42 - something i'd want to include
170:44 - other artists in to kind of grow my
170:47 - brand or would it be something i keep
170:48 - completely exclusive to myself
170:51 - um be careful be careful with copyrights
170:54 - that's a that's a big yeah so massive
170:57 - strikes on that right if you had your
170:58 - own music that you were streaming or
171:00 - things that are like copyright free
171:02 - you could stream that forever that could
171:05 - be one way to do it
171:07 - i mean honestly i would recommend you
171:09 - make videos with your face in it that
171:11 - are teaching people how to make beats
171:13 - how to make traps i think
171:17 - the problem with this stuff is there's
171:20 - no brand
171:21 - so like it's just music i i mean i can
171:24 - go to any channel and listen to music
171:26 - and so right that's your big problem
171:30 - then you just become a commodity
171:31 - like so that's why i would
171:35 - break that by offering more of a service
171:38 - i mean first of all you need to make
171:39 - youtube content where you're
171:40 - teaching you're giving valuable advice
171:42 - maybe you're teaching people how to make
171:44 - trap or you're teaching people how to
171:45 - make whatever this music is
171:47 - do you think an entertainment approach
171:49 - would work too like let's say i
171:51 - want to teach somebody how to make
171:52 - dubstep yes if you could if yes
171:54 - if you make that would be sick if you
171:56 - teach people how to make dubstep and
171:58 - then
171:58 - the video starts with you playing dumps
172:00 - dubstep i think that would be sick
172:02 - what is that guy's name andrew i'm just
172:04 - gonna type in andrew music
172:06 - i forget his name there we go andrew
172:08 - huang yeah
172:10 - he's all about music right but his
172:11 - videos are so freaking entertaining to
172:14 - watch like whatever he makes it on
172:16 - with att like this as you can see for
172:19 - each family member
172:20 - like hbo max all right boom there we go
172:30 - that's a great intro hey it's andrew
172:33 - huang and in today's video we're going
172:35 - to talk about what i think is the most
172:37 - powerful
172:37 - and most versatile soft synth ever faze
172:40 - plant from killerhearts
172:41 - full disclosure i am working with
172:43 - killerhearts i put out a preset pack
172:45 - with them and they also wanted to
172:46 - sponsor a video on my channel
172:47 - as you want pretty much as many as your
172:49 - cpu can handle
172:50 - just do a random variation of the
172:52 - parameter assignment all the possible
172:55 - places project tempo
172:57 - and the other two types of this yeah
172:59 - like
173:00 - if you're good at what you do and you
173:01 - want to go technical and you just want
173:02 - to go all
173:03 - in yeah like you're you'll crush but
173:06 - this is a good way to do it
173:08 - show what you're about to do it's
173:10 - entertaining
173:11 - and you can give value how do you feel
173:13 - about like trolling videos though like i
173:15 - want to pour mountain dew in old
173:17 - instruments and say that's how dubstep's
173:18 - made you know
173:19 - you could do that so like a lot he does
173:23 - that a lot
173:24 - where he uses like random sounds to make
173:26 - dub steps and music and stuff like that
173:28 - from it
173:29 - sweet make them entertaining like the
173:31 - best metric i can give you guys if you
173:33 - want to know if your video is
173:34 - entertaining or not so like for example
173:37 - let's say you picked out a banger title
173:39 - you already know what's going to be a
173:40 - good title video
173:42 - then the next step is sit there have
173:45 - your
173:45 - friends come in and see if you can watch
173:47 - it with them
173:49 - if you're sitting in that video and you
173:50 - want to just [ __ ] they want to shoot
173:52 - themselves like tell them be brutally
173:53 - honest like leave
173:54 - or stop it as soon as you're bored
173:56 - you're going to realize you're not even
173:58 - sitting through your video
173:59 - you know that's the that's the main
174:01 - thing so like
174:03 - if you can sit through your own video
174:05 - and watch it then that's a great video
174:08 - okay but you gotta enjoy it
174:13 - dope um okay cool so
174:16 - did that help mark yeah
174:20 - it really is tough just working with
174:21 - only music i need to grow out of that
174:23 - man
174:24 - yeah yeah and then yeah just add
174:27 - valuable advice to it and you'll be good
174:29 - you gotta add your face in it thank you
174:31 - my friend cesari asks
174:33 - uh tubebuddy or vid iq i do both vid iq
174:36 - until you need to buddy
174:38 - that's what i would say vidiq until you
174:40 - need tubebuddy vid iq is a great
174:43 - thing to use it's free
174:46 - to use with youtube it helps you with
174:48 - your seo and
174:50 - um other stuff i have tubebuddy to do
174:52 - advanced stuff like
174:53 - doing a b testing on my thumbnails
174:57 - so that's that gets more advanced but
174:59 - it's one day it's one thumbnail then the
175:00 - other is another thumbnail and then it
175:02 - picks whichever one the winner is and it
175:03 - makes that the thumbnail permanently
175:07 - what okay cool canva yes
175:10 - okay joey joe are you here
175:20 - i don't know if joey's here or not so
175:22 - i'm going to just skip past it again
175:24 - cool joy keeps posting but joey's not
175:28 - here
175:30 - oh he can't use the mic all right joey
175:33 - well
175:33 - let's take a look at this we won't have
175:35 - a lot of back and forth conversation
175:38 - but i guess i would say the same thing
175:41 - bro
175:41 - like maybe make some music where it's
175:44 - not just music
175:47 - add same thing i'm gonna end this very
175:50 - quickly because
175:51 - it's the same type of oh [ __ ] i didn't
175:53 - share my screen with you guys
175:54 - so here i would say the same thing is
175:57 - happening with joey
176:00 - uh that we had with mark you guys need
176:02 - to add your
176:03 - faces into it and you guys need to add
176:05 - your personalities into it
176:07 - and give valuable tips while
176:10 - entertaining so maybe
176:11 - entertaining the start and then give
176:13 - value on how you made that music or how
176:15 - you made that beat
176:16 - there's a big market for that
176:19 - okay dope awesome
176:23 - uh who else do we got
176:29 - uh-huh perfect
176:34 - oh i'm like really far
176:38 - adam says over nine years ago i did over
176:40 - 70 videos teaching english to native
176:42 - japanese speakers this is the last video
176:44 - i ever did for that channel can you give
176:45 - me a light roast please mostly focus on
176:47 - setup and presentation
176:48 - okay
176:52 - hey minazon how are you doing today
176:56 - holy [ __ ] mochironi genki da yo
177:00 - dude that's kind of cool yeah
177:04 - man good energy adam so happy bro
177:09 - hey that was nine years ago a different
177:11 - time and place
177:11 - [Laughter]
177:14 - yeah and like i said this was 70 videos
177:17 - in
177:18 - more than that i don't even know how
177:19 - many i did but um
177:21 - i i really appreciate everything you've
177:22 - been uh uh doing over these past four
177:25 - days because i think the reason that
177:26 - this
177:27 - particular channel never took off was
177:29 - that i didn't try to
177:31 - model anybody so i think all of my
177:33 - titles sucked um you know my thumbnails
177:35 - probably sucked but i think
177:37 - probably like you said my energy is okay
177:38 - i think my presentation is good so
177:40 - that's why i'm asking
177:41 - more to focus on that yep okay so
177:44 - uh important thing like the video qual
177:48 - i want the video quality not to look
177:50 - like wooden potato
177:51 - so that's important that's one thing i
177:54 - would try to improve
177:55 - because it's really hard to actually
177:57 - even like for example i can't even
177:59 - make this out at all what is there
178:03 - not that i even need to look there uh
178:05 - the text is extremely pixelated
178:08 - so it um it makes me not
178:12 - want to be in it and watch it your
178:14 - energy
178:15 - is the saving grace and i bet your
178:18 - content is good too
178:20 - so yeah i was a linguistic student at
178:22 - the time it was a lot more
178:23 - conversational in japanese i think it
178:25 - was pretty decent behind the teeth there
178:27 - let me see if i can
178:29 - nice zoom in a little bit more great
178:32 - energy dude like really
178:33 - light energy really like calm
178:36 - positive flows so
178:39 - i think that part is really good i think
178:42 - your speaking skills are really great
178:44 - too
178:46 - the biggest frustrations here just lack
178:48 - of pure quality outside of of course
178:50 - thumbnails and titles you can improve
178:52 - just the quality so the video at least
178:54 - should be 720p
178:56 - if not 1080p this video is 240p
179:00 - i have trouble visually seeing what's
179:03 - happening and i am
179:04 - it's really frustrating to hear what's
179:06 - happening if the audio quality could be
179:09 - better
179:09 - and the video quality would be better
179:12 - then this
179:12 - i think you have a lot of potential yeah
179:17 - like i said it was nine years ago
179:18 - there's i don't even know if they had
179:19 - 1080p back
179:20 - i know but even the last videos you sent
179:22 - me you're shooting in a vertical format
179:25 - on an iphone i don't know when you made
179:27 - those videos but they seem more recent
179:29 - yeah the past couple days right so i
179:32 - want you to use an actual camera or
179:34 - actual webcam
179:35 - because your videos i want them to be
179:39 - not vertical i want your videos to be 16
179:42 - by nine
179:43 - so that's a good place to start because
179:45 - again you have good energy
179:46 - you have good thoughts i literally think
179:49 - if you just put a camera
179:50 - proper camera or even a webcam and good
179:53 - audio
179:54 - you can actually have like a good
179:56 - channel but if you
179:58 - don't 16x9 yeah just like a regular
180:00 - camera yeah 16x9
180:04 - yeah um so
180:09 - all right dope that that that's all
180:12 - other than that
180:12 - adam like keep going keep making content
180:15 - just put it right there and you'll be
180:16 - good to go
180:17 - okay thank you i appreciate it yup you
180:20 - got it
180:22 - hi jen oh my god

180:35 - you feel it feels like you're well
180:36 - rested
180:39 - um somewhat
180:41 - [Laughter]
180:42 - lack of sleep a mom of three teenage
180:44 - daughters can be rested i'm rested i
180:47 - think
180:47 - wow yeah that's amazing so i'm so glad
180:50 - to have you on here uh
180:52 - what are you currently are you trying to
180:53 - grow your own youtube channel what's
180:55 - going on
180:56 - i am starting a brand new one i have
180:58 - never had a youtube channel before
180:59 - nice to meet you at work all week i've
181:02 - been watching
181:03 - all the videos all day and catching up
181:05 - so beautiful here i am
181:07 - beautiful awesome well welcome to the
181:10 - channel
181:11 - uh welcome to creating your own channel
181:14 - and being on this journey
181:15 - i'm excited for you is there anything
181:17 - specifically that you have in mind
181:20 - i am probably gonna take what i've been
181:22 - doing um
181:24 - with the success coach live calls and
181:27 - turn it into
181:28 - smaller video snippets got it okay
181:32 - with my with my friends oh wow
181:35 - i love it i angry unicorn friends holy
181:38 - [ __ ]
181:39 - gets really angry amazing i'm really
181:42 - excited about that
181:43 - i think that's going to be awesome jen
181:45 - so that's cool
181:47 - that's a great way to go about it too
181:48 - because it's the easiest way to make
181:49 - content is just your conversations with
181:51 - other people
181:52 - that's a really good hack for making
181:54 - content just having conversations
181:56 - recording them
181:57 - like i believe exact for example even
182:00 - this gives me an idea about adam is
182:03 - how you're making your content jen i
182:04 - think if adam literally had zoom calls
182:07 - with somebody and he recorded them i
182:08 - think and that's
182:09 - great start for making content yeah it's
182:12 - a
182:13 - it's a really great way to get
182:14 - comfortable on camera is just
182:16 - talking to people like the last few
182:19 - months i spent tutoring and talking to
182:20 - people on zoom
182:21 - i've changed how i speak on cameras
182:24 - yes immensely i feel like you're so much
182:28 - more confident in speaking in your
182:29 - energy
182:32 - yeah that's amazing sorry i have really
182:34 - loud dogs and they keep barking
182:36 - that's okay that's okay yeah she um
182:39 - jen is one of the students in our profit
182:41 - with javascript course
182:42 - in clever programmer and she went in
182:45 - there and became a success coach and so
182:47 - she started doing a lot of like
182:48 - calls with people coaching calls
182:50 - one-on-one calls
182:52 - and just by the repetition and practice
182:54 - of that like i
182:55 - me even knowing her i've seen her come a
182:57 - long way and i can
182:58 - see her confidence now you're happy
183:01 - being on camera in front of people
183:03 - big difference so congratulations i mean
183:05 - my first
183:06 - my first video i think ever was sent to
183:08 - you
183:09 - yes when i applied to be a success coach
183:11 - so wow
183:12 - amazing come amazing you've seen the
183:15 - full transformation
183:17 - i love it that is so amazing guys give
183:19 - it up for
183:20 - jen that's amazing
183:22 - [Applause]
183:25 - all right we're gonna take on a few more
183:28 - channels and then go um
183:32 - go with them okay so let me see if you
183:34 - guys have dropped a channel that you
183:36 - guys want me to go through
183:37 - recipe says this was just for tasting
183:39 - purpose so i want
183:41 - medium roast i want to create a channel
183:43 - on coding so let's take a look at it
183:46 - i will share the screen
183:49 - um okay i would
183:55 - amazing fishing okay this is just like a
183:58 - test or something i guess
184:02 - of yours nice
184:06 - good intro
184:09 - [Music]
184:20 - um
184:22 - [Music]
184:23 - dude this channel is actually going to
184:24 - be good if you keep going
184:28 - music is too loud here so i would reduce
184:30 - it
184:31 - like when you're when you guys are
184:32 - speaking don't put the music so loud
184:35 - that's competing with your voice
184:36 - [Music]
184:39 - this is a good video like this is
184:40 - actually like one of those videos
184:42 - that like yeah so i would
184:46 - make more content this is good content
184:50 - the biggest thing is there's only one so
184:52 - i would make a lot more content
184:54 - and i would keep going i wouldn't like
184:57 - stop
184:57 - okay you're making good content you
184:59 - already i know you already watch a lot
185:01 - of vloggers
185:02 - you already got that vlogging style you
185:04 - got the music going you got the whole
185:06 - thing going received so
185:08 - that's what i would say to you make more
185:10 - and just keep going okay
185:14 - so awesome
185:19 - do you think it's still possible to use
185:20 - a funny video model to succeed on
185:22 - youtube
185:23 - yeah you can make funny videos that are
185:25 - like awesome and
185:27 - they work cool
185:34 - [Music]
185:38 - okay awesome yazid says dark roast
185:41 - videos 4k but need some time to process
185:44 - so maybe it's up now
185:48 - 23.5 million is the number of developers
185:51 - this year so why not be the next one in
185:54 - this video we will learn about the top
185:56 - five languages you can learn in 2021
185:58 - anyway good intro very good intro
186:02 - 23.5 million is the number of developers
186:05 - this year nice so why not be the next
186:08 - one
186:08 - in this video you will learn about the
186:10 - top five languages you can learn in 2021
186:13 - um audio is not coming from this mic
186:16 - so make sure the audio is coming from
186:18 - that mic right there
186:20 - um because your audio i think is coming
186:22 - from
186:23 - something else so that's what's
186:24 - weakening the punch punchiness of it
186:27 - the best language to learn in
186:29 - programming is not the best question to
186:30 - ask
186:31 - it depends like for every task for
186:33 - everything it offers value and class
186:35 - and those are frameworks for libraries
186:37 - that help you are for
186:39 - instant language obviously so
186:42 - the most important language the number
186:44 - one language you said it right in the
186:46 - start
186:49 - right you said your number one language
186:52 - is python right
186:55 - yeah that you can consider okay cool
186:58 - yeah
186:58 - right so i would do a few things one
187:00 - make sure i can see the python the text
187:03 - is too much at the bottom left i can
187:05 - barely see it
187:06 - so i would put the python logo or text
187:09 - up here and make sure you use logos
187:11 - because
187:11 - logos are very recognizable they're nice
187:14 - images
187:15 - so that i would use the other thing i
187:18 - would recommend
187:19 - is i wouldn't say the number one as the
187:22 - first one
187:22 - i would put it all the way at the end
187:26 - right if you're if you watch like
187:30 - the oscar awards you know they don't
187:33 - just
187:33 - tell you the best award as the first
187:35 - thing right they're not like
187:36 - and the oscar goes like the they don't
187:39 - just open it they're like the oscar goes
187:40 - too
187:41 - right they keep building up and building
187:44 - up and building up and marinating and
187:46 - marinating and marinating
187:48 - the finally what you're just like i want
187:50 - it please somebody tell me i need to
187:53 - know now so you're going crazy and then
187:55 - they're like
187:56 - right after this commercial break and
187:57 - you're like [ __ ]
187:59 - that's what you want to do with the
188:00 - video like this okay where
188:02 - it the numbers go backwards on this if
188:05 - it's top five
188:06 - number five goes first then number four
188:08 - then number three then number two
188:10 - so like it makes people wanna watch all
188:12 - the way till the number one make sense
188:15 - yeah make sense
188:19 - good job on popping these up those are
188:21 - for the
188:22 - data science developers although python
188:25 - has been for a while now
188:27 - but it makes so much sense to learn in
188:29 - 2021
188:30 - it's a very good language infrastructure
188:32 - so
188:33 - yes great video improve the audio
188:36 - quality and i think you'll be golden
188:38 - uh in the back instead of having this
188:40 - stuff open random stuff i would put code
188:42 - just have some random code open so you
188:45 - look like you code
188:47 - um mic make sure the sound is coming
188:51 - from here
188:51 - and then you're just it's money and then
188:54 - just keep going
188:55 - and then whenever you can afford it
188:56 - invest in a good camera
188:59 - okay sure okay all right it's uh it's 4k
189:02 - but
189:02 - the only problem youtube has some
189:05 - problem with that it takes some time
189:07 - it's not only 360p oh i see
189:10 - yeah okay okay but one thing i want you
189:14 - to see at the end of the video there's a
189:16 - that's a good thing okay okay got it
189:22 - [Music]
189:24 - it's something i tried this time nice
189:33 - dope i liked
189:37 - um i would again the music gets
189:40 - loud yeah it's at the end
189:44 - i know i know but you're still speaking
189:48 - so it can be there but your voice needs
189:50 - to be clear over the like right now
189:52 - you're telling me to like and subscribe
189:53 - which is an important thing to say
189:54 - in your videos oh yeah but i cannot hear
189:57 - you
189:59 - right now the music needs to start going
190:02 - up
190:04 - and now it just goes maximum up okay so
190:06 - like how it works is right now it's a
190:08 - little lower
190:08 - it should be a little lower lower
190:13 - and then up all the way up here
190:17 - and then you leave them with that energy
190:19 - see what i'm saying
190:21 - yeah thanks so the endings just make
190:24 - them
190:24 - um let me see if we can
190:28 - do this give me one second here so
190:39 - all right so let's go here zoom so for
190:42 - example this is how i end
190:44 - mine right so it's like for example
190:45 - whatever video of mine you'll
190:47 - watch hi my name is ronald
190:51 - so let's take a look at like this one
190:52 - for example right how to get
190:54 - your first one i um bought a
190:57 - mac mini reynolds hold up one second
191:01 - random one second one second one second
191:03 - product this thumbnail
191:04 - actually looks fantastic so i'm just
191:06 - gonna show you on the outro
191:08 - how i key up the music so you'll see
191:11 - when i'm talking it's going to keep me
191:13 - talking and then the music is going to
191:15 - come in okay is it so watch this
191:17 - this is raphael quasi i love your
191:19 - beautiful face and i will see
191:21 - you in the next video
191:25 - [Music]
191:32 - and the reason for the music sound
191:34 - increasing so much
191:36 - and that like it hits hard and it
191:39 - doesn't stop me from what i'm saying
191:42 - okay so so raise it at the end
191:45 - you can model my videos you can take a
191:46 - look at like when i'll add in the music
191:49 - and like raise it up
191:51 - okay other than that great video great
191:53 - job
191:54 - thank you so much okay um
191:58 - dope let's take a look at
192:02 - the tool i used to draw on the screen is
192:05 - called screen brush
192:07 - uh that's the tool that's the tool
192:11 - uh yeah it's it's the best tool and pay
192:14 - for it
192:15 - because once you pay it allows you to do
192:17 - a lot of other
192:18 - like things stay on the screen the whole
192:21 - time and yeah
192:22 - it's totally worth it
192:26 - what's the id for that outro now that's
192:28 - a banger
192:30 - uh id for the outro what does that mean
192:34 - mark
192:34 - what do you mean what's id for that out

195:18 - i think it's really worth guys learning
195:19 - how to edit your videos because you can
195:21 - tell stories
195:22 - there's something beautiful about being
195:24 - able to like tell your story
195:26 - the way that you want to tell it uh it
195:29 - makes everything hit home
195:31 - and makes it like you can
195:35 - have people go through an emotional
195:37 - journey you can
195:39 - make people feel sad you can share how
195:42 - happy you were
195:43 - and i think if you spend time learning
195:45 - how to edit i think it'll be like one of
195:47 - the most
195:48 - worth it skills that you actually learn
195:53 - and um let me see if any of these are
195:57 - the ones that have
195:58 - that intro
196:03 - oh yeah there's some some of these like
196:04 - really crazy but yeah
196:06 - like if you can make the intro something
196:08 - that's really exciting to watch and it
196:10 - hooks you
196:11 - then it makes people stay the entire
196:14 - time
196:15 - to watch the rest of your videos so
196:17 - definitely a skill that's
196:18 - very very worth learning and very very
196:21 - worth spending time on
196:23 - um you know this is why those videos are
196:25 - doing well like even when we saw
196:27 - alicia's video there's a reason why i
196:28 - was sitting at like 12 000
196:30 - views or 600 000 views
196:33 - the the editing helps
196:37 - you can shoot just videos where you're
196:38 - just talking to the camera and that's
196:40 - good too
196:41 - but if you can edit and tell your story
196:43 - a certain way
196:44 - it just makes your video so damn good
196:47 - and rewatchable
196:49 - you know and again my test is can you
196:51 - bring your friends like can rocio
196:53 - can she bring her friends and can they
196:55 - watch the video if they can't sit
196:57 - through and watch
196:58 - the video it's not a good video so then
197:01 - you can edit it more and make it better
197:03 - if you want
197:06 - um can we do
197:09 - i knew that was your brother-in-law i
197:11 - see his ads all the time
197:12 - oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's my brother
197:14 - yeah
197:15 - that's the one who i got him started on
197:18 - the youtube channel and everything
197:20 - but yeah now you guys will see his ads
197:22 - probably everywhere
197:24 - can we do a live video editing basics
197:28 - oh that could be cool i don't know if
197:30 - you guys would be into that
197:31 - but we could actually even maybe edit a
197:33 - video live
197:35 - uh yes no give me a thumbs up give me a
197:38 - thumbs down whatever it is that you
197:40 - if enough people want it you guys are
197:42 - excited about it probably could do it at
197:43 - some point
197:44 - okay a lot of you guys are saying yes i
197:46 - love it okay awesome
197:48 - so yeah we can do a live master class
197:50 - where i edit
197:51 - with you guys together and we can take a
197:54 - video and then edit it
197:58 - dope because i think there's a there's a
198:01 - lot of videos on youtube that show you
198:03 - the process but i think it's like
198:05 - you kind of take it to the next level
198:06 - how do you make it into like a banger
198:08 - i think that's what people were kind of
198:09 - talking about like yeah you know
198:11 - someone just walking slowly through you
198:14 - know final cut that's cool but
198:16 - how do you make into like something
198:17 - really good yes
198:19 - okay dope yeah that's uh you're right a
198:21 - lot of people don't actually show that
198:23 - you know and that's
198:24 - one of those things that's super [ __ ]
198:26 - important like even this one right
198:28 - this video the title is a banger title
198:31 - because i know how to get your first
198:33 - 1000 subscribers those
198:34 - that those that video will crush if it's
198:37 - good
198:38 - if i know that if i make this one video
198:41 - and it's good
198:42 - for my rafikaze channel three to six
198:44 - months from now this one video is gonna
198:46 - have me get 40 000 subscribers i'm not
198:48 - kidding
198:48 - just one video so if i can take this one
198:52 - video
198:53 - and spend a lot of time and energy
198:56 - behind it it's really really worth doing
199:00 - that
199:00 - really really worth doing that like for
199:02 - example i'll even show you like if i go
199:03 - to
199:05 - do we have our analytics open anywhere
199:09 - all right let me go to the youtube
199:10 - studio and let me show you guys
199:12 - something right
199:14 - let's go to some of the most popular
199:16 - videos so let's go here and then let's
199:18 - go filter by
199:20 - top five and see if it comes up it's
199:23 - right there
199:24 - cool so i want you to notice the
199:31 - this one yeah so there we go
199:34 - this one video let's go to its analytics
199:41 - guys look at this youtube paid me
199:45 - thousand dollars just to make this video
199:50 - this is just youtube paying me so think
199:52 - about that
199:53 - would you guys like for youtube to pay
199:55 - you 8198.48
199:59 - 49 cents for one youtube video yes or no
200:04 - right this is i'm not even talking about
200:06 - the fact that it got 103
200:08 - 000 subscribers probably it got me
200:12 - 30 000 people on the email list and when
200:14 - i asked to sell the product
200:16 - this video alone probably led to over
200:19 - 100 to 200
200:20 - 000 in cash this year
200:23 - would you guys be interested in knowing
200:25 - how one video can have you make
200:27 - either between eight thousand to a
200:29 - hundred thousand dollars
200:33 - is it a worth its skill to learn is it a
200:35 - worth its skill to spend your time
200:37 - energy and attention on oh yeah
200:42 - yeah no no yeah and if you if your cpm
200:46 - was higher you would be freaking
200:47 - oh billionaire oh my god yeah yeah yeah
200:50 - like
200:50 - you know if i was like oh you know i
200:52 - need to do this the problem is if i only
200:55 - did it for the money i wouldn't probably
200:56 - do it for long enough
200:58 - because i would my my love for it would
201:01 - run out
201:01 - but if i was one of those people who
201:04 - like enjoyed finance
201:06 - and i love teaching and if i taught
201:07 - finance holy [ __ ] it would be like
201:10 - the same exact video would be at 275
201:14 - 000 right now like literally this exact
201:16 - video
201:17 - because yeah yeah the video on my
201:19 - channel would like
201:21 - you know it's like i'm at half that
201:23 - revenue but i have like not even
201:25 - half that many views but i think it's in
201:27 - the health niche so it pays higher
201:29 - bro how much did that video how much did
201:31 - how much did you make off that video
201:33 - that you had 666 000 views it's like
201:35 - it's like 4 000
201:36 - yeah you gotta [ __ ] go bro like you
201:39 - can make one video
201:41 - literally bro you can make how much are
201:42 - you making right now per month bro how
201:44 - much are you making right now
201:46 - i'm i'm barely scratching 100 now
201:48 - because that video started going down
201:50 - but i'm right at like a hundred no no no
201:52 - no i mean how much are you making your
201:53 - job right now per month
201:55 - oh oh making good money six figures
201:58 - okay cool so how like think about this
202:01 - if you could make
202:03 - one or two of those videos per month you
202:05 - would be making close to that same six
202:07 - figure income
202:08 - just from youtube ad revenue which is
202:10 - like i don't even look at youtube ad
202:12 - revenue it's like two
202:14 - it's usually i'm like i think of it as
202:16 - like nothing
202:18 - so i i mean i believe in your [ __ ] bro
202:21 - especially if you did something and it
202:23 - worked you gotta [ __ ]
202:25 - do more of that bro because just a few
202:27 - of those types of videos will just keep
202:29 - exploding you
202:30 - but so this is what i'm saying like
202:33 - the skill of making the videos is so
202:36 - worth it
202:37 - and it's so valuable youtube pays you
202:40 - and if you want to sell a course or
202:42 - build a brand you could do it you guys
202:44 - with me so far on this yes or no
202:48 - guys i i would love to appreciate a
202:50 - little bit higher energy okay i know
202:52 - we're all tired
202:53 - it's three hours or whatever we're in
202:55 - it's a [ __ ] saturday
202:56 - but we're a bunch of lunatics on this
202:58 - goddamn call
202:59 - right that's why we're here so let's
203:02 - [ __ ] go guys i'm going to ask you
203:04 - guys again
203:05 - do you guys want to learn this [ __ ] yes
203:07 - or no
203:13 - that's what i'm talking about guys
203:15 - that's the [ __ ] energy i want that
203:16 - smile i want that energy
203:18 - let's go hey let's go it gives me energy
203:22 - and i mean nobody's talking about
203:23 - youtube with this much energy out there
203:25 - so this is what's so freaking exciting
203:28 - and
203:29 - honestly what inspires me a lot is if we
203:31 - started our youtube channels
203:33 - and we're growing it together then the
203:35 - impact we're making together
203:37 - on the world is just absolutely insane
203:40 - and uh i just saw frank doing this but
203:43 - if you guys want to take a story at any
203:45 - point
203:46 - and tag at raf rafi.causeyrfeh.qazi
203:52 - that would be amazing i reply to every
203:53 - single person and i will repost all of
203:55 - your stories okay
203:57 - so this is
204:00 - one freaking video one video
204:04 - worth eight thousand one hundred and
204:06 - ninety eight dollars this is just one of
204:08 - them if i go back
204:10 - to the channel videos let's take a look
204:12 - at this other one
204:13 - this other one is worth how much let's
204:15 - take a look
204:17 - 12 dollars let's go lifetime
204:23 - this one is also worth 8 654.
204:27 - and got me 55 000 subscribers so think
204:30 - about this you guys
204:32 - two videos got me how many subscribers
204:36 - two videos how many 155
204:41 - 150 god damn 5 000 subscribers
204:45 - two videos two videos
204:49 - like if you can put your heart and soul
204:53 - and effort into it and you learn it
204:55 - two videos can get you that right and
204:57 - here's just on one more video and that's
204:59 - that eight thousand six hundred fifty
205:00 - four dollars so if you take those two
205:02 - videos
205:02 - it's sixteen thousand dollars that
205:04 - youtube paid me we got 155 000
205:07 - subscribers we probably got 40 to 50 000
205:09 - people on the email list
205:11 - and then when we were like hey we have
205:13 - these courses
205:14 - are you guys interested a whole bunch
205:16 - took us
205:17 - up on it and it provided them value and
205:20 - it exploded our business does that make
205:22 - sense guys
205:24 - yeah yeah yeah so this is
205:27 - the name of the game this is why i think
205:29 - this is so important to kind of
205:30 - understand
205:31 - why this [ __ ] is important and uh if i
205:34 - go share my screen again with you guys
205:37 - when i saw that i can make a video on
205:39 - how to get your first 1000 subscribers
205:42 - i wanted to make sure that i make that
205:43 - video bang
205:45 - so like it's gonna be actually good so
205:48 - the few important things i want to show
205:50 - you here that i'm doing is
205:52 - first of all i want to get to the point
205:54 - in the first
205:55 - one to three seconds that fast
205:58 - right when we saw alecio's video he got
206:00 - to the point really fast
206:02 - i'm going to get to the point really
206:03 - fast few other things i want to do
206:06 - i want to have framing that's
206:09 - hyper hyper relevant hyper relevant
206:13 - framing
206:15 - before i even say a word you already
206:18 - [ __ ] know
206:19 - this [ __ ] knows some [ __ ]
206:22 - right so
206:26 - you're gonna watch the sec second you
206:28 - know you're gonna watch like
206:30 - two seconds in and four seconds and
206:31 - seven seconds in so that's the hack
206:34 - this is why i even told a yazid put
206:37 - coding screen behind you makes like
206:40 - subconsciously it makes people stop so
206:43 - the framing
206:43 - is like perfect in that sense where
206:45 - there's a timeline
206:47 - you know that this guy's gonna talk
206:48 - about like this is not gonna be just
206:50 - some
206:51 - boring video where this dude is just
206:52 - gonna talk to me for 10 minutes about
206:54 - how to get your first down subscribers
206:55 - you're like i see a camera
206:57 - i see a tv with the timeline i see
207:00 - another computer
207:01 - i see this crazy thing okay something is
207:04 - about to happen what's about to happen
207:06 - and let's go
207:08 - how to get your first 1000 subscribers
207:12 - right i have a text come in with the key
207:15 - things that you're looking for how to
207:16 - get your first 1000 subscribers
207:18 - and the first two seconds with key
207:21 - framing
207:22 - so you if you're coming here to watch
207:23 - this video would you be hooked yes or no
207:27 - yes right you're gonna be hooked you're
207:30 - like okay cool
207:31 - let's talk about it
207:34 - [Music]
207:41 - guys so that is just to kind of get you
207:44 - into the video
207:45 - like now i've told you what's going to
207:47 - happen now i give you a little
207:49 - time lapse of me editing whatever you're
207:52 - like oh this [ __ ] is cool
207:54 - and then right before we start the video
207:56 - i give you now this is where i'm gonna
207:57 - build authority
207:59 - okay so this is where i'm gonna tell you
208:02 - why you should probably pay attention to
208:05 - what i have to say
208:06 - because you came in you've given me some
208:08 - of your time i want to be respectful of
208:10 - that
208:11 - and now i want to tell you like yo
208:13 - before you give me
208:14 - 16 more minutes i want to share with you
208:18 - what i have done so then i can respect
208:20 - more of your time
208:21 - you guys see what i'm saying
208:24 - my own youtube channel to over 830 000
208:27 - subscribers called
208:28 - clever programmer and multiple videos
208:30 - with over millions of views and i cannot
208:33 - wait to share the secrets and insights
208:35 - with you guys that i've learned from
208:37 - growing my own coding youtube channel
208:39 - [Music]
208:43 - oh and by the right and then right
208:45 - before it starts this is a hack for you
208:47 - alicia i don't know if you do this but
208:49 - make sure at the right time get them to
208:50 - hit the like button
208:52 - the way right before we start if you
208:54 - could smash that like button that would
208:56 - mean the world to me
208:58 - good morning you guys today i'm starting
209:00 - right and then it just gets
209:02 - started um and then it gets going and
209:04 - then i take
209:05 - so i know this is going to be a banker
209:07 - title
209:08 - i want to make this now the best video
209:11 - ever because i know it's just going to
209:12 - be
209:12 - so freaking worth my time energy and
209:15 - effort
209:16 - just like for example you know i keep
209:18 - coming back to you alicia
209:20 - but even that youtube how to make uh how
209:22 - to monetize your youtube channel
209:24 - fast right that video
209:27 - you you know that's a banger title so
209:29 - when you actually put your energy into
209:31 - it it's totally worth it same thing with
209:32 - that 21 day
209:33 - thing that you did yeah i literally just
209:36 - like you said earlier i
209:37 - modeled videos that were already
209:38 - crushing it and said let me just do like
209:40 - an updated version of it
209:42 - that's the right way to do it bro it's
209:43 - the right way to do it um
209:45 - and then here i like was just learning
209:47 - so this is where i make it fun for me so
209:49 - then it doesn't just feel like a job
209:51 - so for me i like learning things i like
209:56 - uh getting inspired and i don't want to
209:59 - just do
209:59 - only the things i know so for example
210:01 - here i
210:02 - am now getting a lot more into sound
210:04 - design and i'm having fun with it so
210:06 - when i say sound design that's like
210:08 - adding audio that's like not supposed to
210:11 - be there that wasn't originally there
210:12 - you know so it's like the door opening
210:14 - or the cabinet opening
210:16 - so i have this little fun segment where
210:17 - i'm just taking a coffee break
210:35 - right and then i bring this coffee i sit
210:37 - down and i get back to the rest of the
210:39 - video
210:40 - so like for this video
210:44 - i am not worried about you know should i
210:47 - give this video my all or not like a
210:49 - video with the title like this
210:51 - i want to give it my all and go hard
210:53 - make sure that this video is good
210:55 - and then it's packed with value i'm
210:56 - giving you actually tangible advice you
210:58 - can use
210:58 - so this video is like phenomenal i think
211:00 - a lot of
211:01 - all of you guys should actually watch
211:03 - this on my youtube channel like
211:05 - mindset stuff is great there's this one
211:07 - part where my girlfriend is crying
211:08 - because her youtube channel isn't
211:09 - growing
211:10 - and i literally break down like look at
211:13 - this for the my first
211:14 - 10 months i [ __ ] got nothing like
211:18 - i made 41 in my first 10 months
211:21 - and almost no views and her channel is
211:24 - like
211:25 - doing nothing right here it was just
211:26 - getting one subscriber at a time so how
211:28 - do you actually deal with this type of
211:29 - stuff mentally
211:30 - and what do you need to prepare for so i
211:32 - try to pack that in in that video
211:34 - all those he's just shaking his head i
211:36 - like it
211:39 - oh my god that's so cute how many of
211:41 - them are there at least yo wow
211:44 - goodness too many man like one popped
211:47 - out i was like okay and two and
211:49 - three and then i think i lost count
211:52 - adorable oh wow adam
211:56 - everybody has kids popping out randomly
211:59 - just all happened at once i love it
212:01 - say hi hi
212:05 - let's see i'm not the only one here yeah
212:07 - yeah
212:09 - frankie pop out um hey
212:13 - uh yeah feel free to ignore this
212:16 - question if it's too off topic but i did
212:18 - want to know when you said that you quit
212:20 - like dropped everything your clients to
212:21 - go youtube full-time did you save up
212:24 - like three to six months expenses or
212:25 - something or how did you get by in that
212:27 - um lean time when you had no income to
212:30 - the point where you were actually making
212:32 - some i um
212:34 - so what i because i was forced to make
212:37 - my youtube channel
212:38 - successful and make income from it
212:41 - i started coaching people one-on-one
212:45 - the people that found me from youtube
212:48 - so like for example i was just like hey
212:50 - i'll charge you 35 an hour to teach you
212:53 - coding then i was like hey i'll charge
212:55 - you 50 an hour to teach you coding
212:57 - so i started making my living
213:01 - very quickly from my youtube channel
213:09 - so that's what i did adam until later i
213:11 - could figure out how to sell a course
213:12 - and stuff like that
213:17 - um oh wait i'm reading comments
213:20 - can you also do
213:23 - why don't you have merch i will have
213:25 - merch i already have a lot of like uh
213:28 - taglines that i want to have on my merch
213:30 - like for example in production we trust
213:34 - um another one would be like just one
213:38 - and then there are a few other ones that
213:40 - i would want to have in there so i would
213:41 - i would really love to have merch at
213:43 - some point
213:45 - cool i have no words when i see these
213:47 - stats yeah
213:48 - i mean they're really really like crazy
213:51 - like sometimes for me
213:52 - even for me they're hard to like believe
213:54 - like what is happening
213:56 - wow but you know it's just consistently
213:59 - putting that work
214:00 - over time believing in that thing and
214:03 - keep doing it
214:04 - and then those results just keep getting
214:05 - bigger and bigger every single time
214:08 - did you find that playing live shows
214:10 - helped grow your social
214:11 - yeah lives help grow my social media but
214:15 - most importantly lives make me come to
214:17 - life so for example
214:19 - this video isn't going to get that many
214:21 - views this video like right now the zoom
214:23 - call that we're on
214:25 - is not going to get any views i know
214:26 - that because the replay value of it is
214:28 - very little
214:29 - it's kind of like boring to watch a
214:31 - video of like other people on zoom
214:34 - so i understand that that's probably
214:36 - just gonna die at like two thousand
214:37 - views or one thousand views
214:39 - the reason for this is it feeds my soul
214:43 - to connect with everybody that's on this
214:44 - call ah
214:46 - it feeds my soul and i love it when i
214:48 - can actually speak to the people that
214:50 - are behind the camera
214:51 - you know that normally i just have to
214:53 - imagine all of you have to imagine a
214:55 - stacy and all you guys
214:57 - but it's so much it gives me life and
214:59 - heart and then this is the food for my
215:02 - soul and then it lets me go and then
215:03 - make more content for you guys and come
215:05 - up with ideas
215:06 - that are gonna actually help all of you
215:10 - because up until the zoom call i
215:12 - appreciate it kazi it's like you know
215:14 - coming from the pwj
215:16 - og crew yeah uh it's we we love having
215:19 - this one-on-one i don't care if it dies
215:21 - on youtube
215:21 - right like yeah like be able to talk to
215:24 - everyone like all the brand new people
215:26 - learning how to grow youtube let's let's
215:28 - go hey that's beautiful bro
215:30 - thank you i appreciate it i appreciate
215:33 - that energy
215:34 - um yeah i love this man it's so it's
215:38 - really exciting and it um it doesn't
215:41 - become real for me
215:42 - until we can do this like until we can
215:46 - do this
215:46 - it's just the number now says 3.7 k
215:50 - members in the facebook group
215:52 - uh the number now says 195 comments
215:55 - you know so it's just like random
215:57 - numbers at best what i see
215:59 - even if i see comments just like avatar
216:01 - next to it
216:02 - but until i can start speaking with all
216:04 - of you guys and talking with all you
216:06 - guys that's when it becomes real and
216:07 - that's when it's really exciting for me
216:09 - personally
216:13 - uh rasib says could you please repeat
216:15 - from where you bring background music
216:17 - epidemic sounds robin says that is one
216:21 - reason why i clicked on your facebook
216:22 - ad for a five day clone class because
216:24 - you had super cool setup monitors desk
216:26 - equipment and lighting that's awesome
216:29 - robin talk to me about that
216:34 - hey hi no that's why i uh i don't even
216:38 - know why the facebook ad popped up in my
216:40 - feed i have no idea because i guess i've
216:42 - been um
216:42 - [Music]
216:43 - i had a project i had to do so i'd been
216:45 - googling a lot of
216:47 - different programming courses i had a
216:50 - program but not for many years
216:53 - and then one day that popped up and the
216:54 - only reason i clicked on it was because
216:56 - you had a setup like what i would want
216:59 - wow that's the only reason basically
217:02 - damn
217:02 - super cool wow so then i yeah so i
217:05 - joined the course
217:06 - and it's awesome that's amazing i love
217:09 - that
217:10 - because i i programmed like super long
217:12 - ago
217:14 - in the olden days and so i have no
217:16 - community whatsoever
217:17 - yeah because none of my friends are
217:19 - interested anymore they're all like
217:21 - doing other things so
217:22 - yeah awesome because this is what i want
217:24 - to do so
217:25 - now i have people to connect to great i
217:29 - love it and
217:30 - i'm going to ask you you said you want
217:33 - you're interested in programming so what
217:35 - like what made you join the youtube
217:38 - challenge and actually stay on this for
217:40 - the last
217:41 - few days uh
217:44 - well i have many ideas for youtube
217:46 - channels i did
217:48 - we did have a channel i've just built an
217:50 - online school
217:51 - and so we did have a channel but someone
217:54 - actually
217:55 - sort of they didn't steal it but they
217:58 - sort of hijacked it
217:59 - so i've stopped doing it and so now i
218:03 - want to get back
218:03 - on and i want to maybe do it for myself
218:05 - instead of doing it for a company
218:07 - so i'm just trying to get ideas and get
218:09 - inspiration
218:10 - and motivation i'm buying a mic
218:13 - i'm putting an order in tonight for mike
218:16 - yeah
218:17 - and um yeah damn okay
218:20 - that's amazing i'm excited for you and
218:22 - what uh are you getting a yeti or
218:24 - something different
218:25 - yeah i want to get a yeti okay cool i'm
218:27 - excited
218:28 - and you want to talk about coding on
218:30 - your channel
218:31 - no uh no i'm not an expert in coding
218:35 - got it um i used to be in c but that was
218:38 - ancient
218:39 - you know forever ago wow okay i have
218:42 - uh like someone's hired me or
218:45 - asked me to build and at some apps like
218:48 - in chinese medicine and doing
218:50 - um chinese medicine diagnosis and
218:53 - chinese astrology and doing health
218:55 - diagnosis from chinese astrology some
218:57 - like really sort of esoteric very
218:59 - super cool things that are very esoteric
219:02 - and i want to make it
219:04 - um uh like
219:08 - so so that anybody will be interested in
219:10 - it got it so take this esoteric language
219:12 - and make it
219:14 - attractive to people because it's super
219:16 - cool that no one knows about it
219:17 - yep so one thing i'll just share is if
219:20 - you're especially getting into territory
219:22 - where it's esoteric
219:23 - or there's very few of it happening
219:28 - uh the one thing i want you to also
219:30 - focus on and make sure
219:32 - see if you can find somebody you can
219:33 - model that is doing something similar
219:35 - somewhere
219:36 - and has success with it if you start off
219:39 - by modeling that
219:40 - that will give you a lot of room to grow
219:43 - really fast
219:45 - and then you can get really unique with
219:47 - it so that's one thing i would recommend
219:49 - because
219:49 - the one thing that scares me about like
219:51 - something that's very
219:53 - uh untested is you'll spend your time
219:56 - doing it
219:56 - but then nothing will come of it so i
219:59 - want you to get some results from it too
220:01 - because you're gonna spend time energy
220:02 - effort
220:03 - money right so i want you to go and
220:06 - model
220:07 - in areas where whatever maybe there's
220:09 - some other channel that's like teaching
220:11 - something esoteric or something like
220:12 - different
220:13 - model the way that they teach it in
220:15 - terms of like their titles and
220:17 - thumbnails
220:18 - and then content just make your you can
220:20 - make whatever
220:21 - content that speaks to you yeah cool
220:24 - okay thanks awesome thank you so much
220:26 - for coming on robin i appreciate you
220:28 - all right beautiful

225:26 - youtube channel niche all right what are
225:28 - you going to be making content on
225:30 - what are you going to be bringing value
225:32 - to people in so for example for me
225:34 - a lot of my content is going to be about
225:36 - people growing their youtube
225:38 - so how to get your first 1000
225:39 - subscribers how to get 10 000
225:41 - subscribers how much did youtube pay me
225:42 - to make a million dollars
225:44 - that stuff okay so
225:47 - have that what do you want to help
225:50 - people with you want to help them with
225:52 - coding
225:52 - do you want to help them in personal
225:53 - development you want to help them with
225:55 - music
225:56 - that's number one thing number two i
225:58 - want you guys to write down
226:00 - tonight in your homework is
226:04 - what are you gonna sell all right
226:08 - what is it that you're gonna sell is it
226:10 - gonna be a product
226:11 - is it gonna be a service um are you
226:14 - gonna sell your skill of coding
226:16 - you know like what is it that you're
226:17 - gonna sell for me it was a course
226:19 - that i decided to sell some people want
226:22 - to sell a coaching program
226:23 - some people want to you know please
226:26 - don't sell t-shirts
226:27 - especially in the start it's the hardest
226:29 - way to make money um
226:31 - you can do that later when you're grown
226:33 - as a brand
226:34 - so i recommend the cheapest stuff
226:38 - go to that years later when you're
226:40 - bigger
226:41 - i recommend the start more expensive
226:44 - because you're only one person
226:45 - so then you can actually give more value
226:48 - and get also more income
226:52 - and then later when you can fulfill for
226:55 - mass volumes of people then offer
226:57 - cheaper stuff
226:58 - okay so figure out what your product or
227:02 - service or thing to sell is gonna
227:04 - be is the homework assignment clear for
227:07 - you guys
227:09 - is it clear yes or no yes frank says yes

notebook with you have a pen or a pencil if you want to do that right now just stand up and go take care of that so you have something to write with so you can remember everything that we do in this

you know whether i'm doing a roast and you're a part of it or you're just watching this and enjoying it make sure to tag me at rafe.kazee for instagram uh who here knows how to do that stuff like tagging and instagram stories just raise your hands if you're familiar with it okay cool most hopefully most people are if you're not that's totally fine it's not the end of the world okay great so that now if you guys need the community access this is a way to get in touch with me this is how you can text me if you want and get a hold of me and we can we can be in touch together so this is the number that you would use for that and with that said this was yesterday's training this was the roast with devin this was a lot of fun and i'm hearing that devin is already happier so that's exciting this was the one with frank this was i think a little bit of a light roast ronald who needed to work on his thumbnails although so so many of you guys were here we had tons of comments so thank you guys so much for that i really really appreciate you guys for your engagement your heart that you're bringing to the table like i remember the you know conversations that we had with stacy or everybody that was a part of it it was amazing so thank you guys for that and just like every day i want you guys to bring it your all at a hundred percent because that's how you're gonna get those results that you're looking for cool is everybody here ready to play at 100 on a count of three i want you to say yes and i want to hear you three two one yes yes yes beautiful so that's the energy so

love it beautiful so that's the energy we need that's how we're going to be able to then take the things that we're learning from here and be able to apply them great so let's move forward do we have more than this okay cool so let me hit stop sharing and now let's go over what it looks like to actually have a plan where you can be on track to make a million dollars are you guys interested in seeing that yes of course okay okay so there are multiple ways yesterday we talked about it guys and we talked about that there are a lot of different ways you can make money from youtube um do any of you guys remember what those ways were if you remember you could just say them out loud of course brand your brand yourself make a course brand yourself make a course awesome i love that olivia already got her mind on that i like it views views so like ads youtube paying you cool what else collaborations with others collaboration awesome what else so super chats super chats yep transactions so there's tons of different ways right like we already listed them out yesterday you guys listed out you guys were like affiliate marketing sponsorships youtube ad revenue you know um super chats transactions like the people paying you donations tshirts merch there's so many different ways there's no really limit to it i could show you a thousand different ways people became millionaires with youtube but i want to start to now show you guys how i did it and maybe it would bring some value to you guys okay so for me when it came to youtube was how can i bring value to a lot of people and i knew that if i could bring a lot of value to people at scale then i could make money at scale right so if you sit and have a oneonone session with somebody and they pay you how many people have you helped in a oneonone session and you sit with somebody and help them how many people have you helped just one person right so if you're helping only one person you're collecting one payment yes now yes what if in one sitting you had a group of five people like sitting right in front of you like physically and you were helping all five of them and you helped all five of them and they all five then pay you right so you've helped how many people five five five and you got paid how many times five times five times right and you did it all in the same single one hour does that make sense yeah yes yes so same thing if you i'm to make a monitor cohost as well so give me one second boom there we go so same thing will happen if you do whether you help one person at one time or you help five people at five time then you just are able to make five times the income because you help five times the people cool so that's kind of what happened with you know clever programmer where i found a way to essentially help more people and when you're on youtube and you're making content you can help more people at one time whether it's 10 people or 20 people or 100 people so then does it make sense to you guys that if you helped 100 people it's possible you could get paid two times more than what you make right now or maybe three times more than what you make right now is that possible yeah raise your hands if that's yes so absolutely absolutely love it so if that's possible then the question becomes well why don't we do it why don't we oh i'm doing it now stacy's doing it i know olivia's doing it i know some of you are on youtube doing it so why don't we do it maybe lack of selfconfidence that we can bring value yep that i think that hits the nail on the head um and why do people think that like what for example um and uh just tell me if i'm saying your name wrong is it rocio that's correct okay so rocio like what is it for you that makes you feel that where you feel that maybe you're not bringing value to people um i guess you live in a world where we're kind of wanting immediate feedback um rather than just doing something stepping back and allowing it to be we're constantly checking the analytics and we're like trying to say oh well we don't have views so we must not be good enough yes what she just said guys was that valuable at all to any of you and she won't take offense if you don't raise your hands if you but if you thought it was valuable truly thought it was even though one little nugget raise your hands or just say yes out loud yes yes yes thanks right yes yes yes so here's the thing this is immediate feedback for you because we have a community that is like very positive and that's right here when you're doing it alone you don't hear that all the time right so if you are looking for it then what you said is true you won't really get it but what you want to share if it's your internal truth just know that there are people that are going to find this valuable there are people out there who's actually listening to you and care about what you have to say so that part is you know this is one of the reasons why a lot of people don't actually do it and don't go through it because i think for a lot of people it's very clear they get i think people theoretically understand if you do youtube you know a lot of us know so many people that have become millionaires so a lot of us are like oh this is a very possible route right but then we actually don't end up doing it and most of the times that's because we are blocking ourselves mentally or we're thinking that we don't bring enough value or we're thinking this that or the other thing so the important part is like how can we get that out of our head how can we have that mindset shift where we're not just addicted to that validation because you won't get it that's the problem behind it the validation you're looking for you might start getting it when you get 10 000 subscribers or 50 000 subscribers but if you're looking for it today when you have zero subscribers you're not gonna get it right you're not gonna always have these people who are there so understand that even your guys's world view or a perspective can actually bring value even you just sharing your insight can bring value how many of you people here have one or more friends raise your hand if you have one or more friends okay why are those friends there with you why help you personality things in common personality things in common they add value to my life add value to your life cool because of my nature we do because of your nature what else so if you have if you have these friends next to you and they're there are they there because they are they want your money i mean some of them might want free food sometimes but right like it's not because they want your money it's not because they need something from you i think friendships are is one of the most people loyalty right friendships is one of the most pure relationships you can have because they don't even need anything from you they're not dependent on you in any way they're still there so if you have one friend or more friends then i believe it's possible for you that there might be some other people out there do you guys believe there might be some other people out there that are like you or your friends out of the six or seven billion people that exist on this planet yes for sure so then that's your tribe right and take yourself and take your best friend and multiply that that's your tribe so it's very exciting like what's actually out there and what's possible even this setting here is my dream like literally i think about it yesterday and i'm thinking holy crap we were only supposed to do an hour and a half of the challenge and we went for like four hours and i could have gone for far more and i was like loving it right and like the energy was amazing everybody was here and like everybody was engaged so it's a tribe of people i'm putting my stuff out there and then the people who connect come to it it's kind of really beautiful it's like finding friends online and i feel like youtube is like the best way to do that and then imagine imagine if your best friend started hanging out with you and imagine if your best friend started paying you to hang out with you and then imagine all your friends that hang out with you started paying you to hang out with you that's pretty crazy life that's kind of awesome you're like wow like not only am now i don't even have to spend time doing this job i don't like i can literally just hang out with the people i love and care about how many of you guys would like to hang out with your friends and get paid for it almost everybody right it's a fun place to be at it's a place where you're cared for you're loved you're appreciated so that's what i want you to take out of it that that's actually possible for you that's possible for a lot of people now is everybody going to make a million dollars probably not but not everybody wants to make a million dollars to be happy right a lot of you want to make different amounts of like some of you might be so ambitious here you're like i want to make 10 million dollars some of you might be like hey if i make 50 000 i'll be happy some of you might be like if i make 10 000 extra i'll be happy so right now when i ask you what's your number just on the count of three i want you to spit out what's your number that that will make you happy okay so here's how it's gonna go i'm gonna count to three and then i want you to just say whatever your number is thirty thousand thirty million whatever it is okay so one two three did you guys hear that the answers were just all over the place yeah that's what it is but whatever but whatever if somebody said a billion or a trillion that's that's what gets them happiness right maybe that doesn't get you happiness so that's an important conversation to have and think about like what is the number that you will like that's enough and you'll enjoy and you'll be happy with right so that's why it's important and you guys heard everybody has a different number and i can't force you to think a certain way not anybody else can force you to think a certain way it's also called like a financial thermostat where is it at for you right and if you said a billion are you working like a bill are you working hard like you want a billion and if you're not then you don't want a billion that's the conversation i had with frank yesterday wait hold on not frank zach actually yesterday uh where we had the you guys remember the ultra dark roast from yesterday um and so yeah so it went so dark it went so dark that was a lot of fun it was like a therapy session yeah it was it was yeah the guy who played piano exactly so like with him right you guys stuff was so good so good i was like i was like make old town road make every single song out there man like right is that not happening if i had if i had one 100th of that skill yes i mean music has such an emotional impact on people like if you can play why wouldn't you that's true i'd be on tick tock i'm killing it right take talk and all those places are the places to go you know and that's why when i looked at it yesterday i was like you're you're you say to me you want it i want your actions to follow and then you're gonna explode and so that's the thing we all have a different number in mind but what i realized is at some point i gave up the number game because it becomes really pointless because there came a point where i had all the money i needed to run away from everything i hated like at first i thought i just wanted like some insane amount of money right and what i started what i realized is i didn't even know until 2019 to 2020 i didn't even know like what you need to do to actually just be um i didn't i didn't know how to run away run towards happiness i didn't know how to run towards a goal the only thing i knew that i actually built the business off of was like i didn't like that i had to be financially dependent on anybody else i didn't like that i couldn't afford or help my parents go to the doctors and it that's they needed that a lot i didn't like that my friend just started like literally a week before me and then ended up making way more money than me freelancing i was like [ __ ] that like i've been doing it for years so there was a lot of pain that caused me to run towards and like grow my channel grow my brand in the start but then i realized 2018 i became really like in a weird way unhappy because i felt that i got everything i wanted i'm like i've beat everybody that was like once my mentor i have gotten more money than i don't know i know what to do with i'm traveling everywhere i'm in the heart of hollywood i i have my friends with me i'm dating whatever i want like crazy but what i realized was i was not happy like i didn't have a vision to run towards but i had run away from everything i didn't want it does that kind of make sense with you guys like so ran away from my pain yes money doesn't bring happiness yes but i also want to be careful about phrases like that too because sometimes we end up thinking and i know you don't think this olivia but for some people they start thinking like oh money is the root of evil or phrases like this can quickly make it like that where it's quite the opposite i think people who have money on average are actually some of the most generous and kind people just the other day we were celebrating something and we got so excited at this restaurant and my friends started screaming because it was one of the biggest things we had ever done and um we were like going crazy right we closed this like deal it was huge it was like a 80 thousand dollar deal going nuts and this like this group of ladies like about eight or ten of them sitting on the table and i told my friend i'm like dude he he didn't even like scream out of excitement it almost sounded like a scream out of panic because we didn't know we're gonna close the deal and he's like oh and i was like dude what happened are you okay and like my other friend was like dude are you okay and he's like yeah i'm fine it was frankie frankie sitting right here um and he's like yeah i'm fine i'm like what happened look at this and i was like oh and then we're trying to keep it low because we're at a restaurant and this group of eight or ten ladies you're like oh what happened tell us what happened they're like screaming and we're like we just closed the biggest deal ever we're so excited and they're and they're like all right champagne's on us and they just order us all champagne and sent it over and i was like wow that is so [ __ ] amazing because i know that if i was not here i don't know if anybody would be happy i've had people yell at me like get out of here look go away so i'm like wow these rich people are nice so for me you know it's like i think it's just it's a balance but but even with that said i knew how to run away from everything i didn't want i didn't know how to run towards so running towards something is really really important um at some point it's kind of what you have to do otherwise you you just kind of go around in circles in life and not really get anywhere so uh now the more tactical part that some of you guys are like okay you know this is this is cool i'm enjoying this but let's get to a little bit of the tactical part cool is that cool with you guys we might get a little bit technical and [ __ ] but i want you guys to stay in there and then we're going to come back to everything all right and then plus we got the roast at the end so um um cool so let's let's go ahead and do that huh are you on here okay kenz hold on one second frankie can uh amanath make you a mod frankie okay i see you all right there we go all right cool so we're all ready let's get into it so for me you guys can see the whiteboard yes yes okay dope so when i broke my first come on how am i doing the graphs so this was like so this is 2017. this is um let's just say 18 2018 this is 2019 and this is 2020 okay now it takes a lot of work and a lot of time but frankie when when did we break the first million like the total that video that we have where we went nuts 2019. okay so i'll show you guys let me see if i can actually find that what the [ __ ] man there's some new chrome update and it just keeps crashing chrome i i really really hate it my chrome has never crashed more times what's up uh oh yeah yeah yeah it's right here but you know what that's fine i don't need these pages all right so let me go here actually and i might have this moment saved so let's go back oh [ __ ] okay guys get ready this is one of the best moments of my entire life this is what it feels like to make a million so that happens and then after that there's not much more i mean so that's that was our moment of when we hit that number and it was august 15 2019 that was the exact day i believe that we hit that number so middle of so right here this is it okay um that's when it happened did it explode some of your guys's ears that was a really loud scream you guys okay everybody doing fine hey kazi you cracked 2000 followers oh on instagram right nice yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you guys so much we cracked 1 000 subscribers on our new youtube channel and uh 2 000 on the new instagram so thank you guys i appreciate that uh this is exactly when the million was broken so think about this and 20 there was some stuff i did in 2016. like but to be fair i really started end of 2016. so if you guys remember uh day one i don't know who was here day one but like if you guys were here day one you guys remember when i was talking about like i started in 2016. you guys remember that yes yes yes so in 2016 uh it was really the end of the year it was like quarter four of 2016 where i really actually committed to youtube other than that i wasn't making any videos for the last like you know in quarter two three barely making any i made probably two videos and those you know many many months like the first nine months of 2016 i made probably two videos so quarter four is really the quart quarter account in 2016 because that's where i made a lot of videos like probably 20 to 40 videos so i started really end of 2016 and then 2019 was where we actually officially cleared over 1 million and then in 2020 we have now it's growing really really fast so now i think we've cleared over 2.6 million yeah so it's a lot it took a lot of work and if you guys want to go ahead and give a round of applause you can't that would make me really happy because i worked my ass off for it um but this wasn't a very exciting moment thank you for that gravit gabi i appreciate it so this was a crazy moment it took a lot of time and growth but what i'm what i want to show you guys here is the actual truth of it so like i didn't become a millionaire here it didn't happen here and it didn't happen here and nor do i want to sell you that does that make sense so it's like this is the actual truth of what happened for me so this is not something that happens overnight definitely not something that happened overnight for us but if you knew that this is possible does it make you a little bit more willing to actually put in the work if this is possible for you yes yeah no doubt yes okay definitely commander for sure awesome like i don't work for money yeah right so um but money is again i want to hammer this home money is a really important part of the game really [ __ ] important part of the game if you don't get this part right a lot of the stuff is really hard for example if you're doing a fulltime job how are you really going to dedicate your time fully to youtube if that's the only way you know how to make an income like i am 12 so uh i know i know i know so but still it doesn't matter even if you're 12 and if you want to do this i do want you to think about it don't put a limit on yourself just because you're 12. just like i would tell somebody who's 79 years old don't put a limit on themselves so i i do want you guys to think about like how does the practicality of making income work because that's how like we got a team of people to then grow it but it's just something important right if you maybe if that's not your goal to hit a 1 million if it's less then that's okay too you can be doing other things and still growing your channel at the same time 2018 for us was i think 2018 we hit um this was our year where in one year like in 2016 when i started i think in 2016 my income was probably 70 000 this year if not more i don't exactly remember the number but 2016 i think was maybe 70 between 70 to 100 000. i can't pinpoint i was doing a lot of like freelancing work in this time 2017 when i started my youtube channel and i actually went hard uh was the year where we did two hundred and ten thousand two hundred and two hundred and ten thousand i think two hundred and ten thousand uh 2018 we did 350 000 in one year 2019 we did 600 000 in one year and then 2020 was where we did over 1.6 million in just one year like so the year is not over yet we're still in november we still have december to go cool so this is what the journey is what it looks like what it looked like for me um for me youtube became a thing really really quickly and it's kind of because of how soon i made the decision to go all in i attribute a lot of it to my commitment and decision to just go all in as soon as possible right around this right around this area this like transition from 2016 to 2017 i was making a lot of money decent amount of money 70 no between 70 to 100 000 and i gave up all my clients i gave up literally every single dollar so i took that income from 70 between 70 100k and i dropped it down to a big fat zero i dropped that income because i knew that that's what's going to force me to actually go all into the business and force me to actually generate revenue from the business because if i'm not forced to generate revenue from the business i'm just gonna be kind of like bullshitting around for a really long time that makes sense so for you let me see if uh zoom still there okay if by the way frankie if you get any good questions or anything you want to pop up you can just bring them up and same thing i'm honest for you if you have there any good questions i can answer them as they come up so um i guess any questions right now for you guys that you have i feel like it's a good moment for some kind of questions you guys might have relevant to what i'm talking about here who is this uh mark mark okay go for it yeah so uh looking at this kind of flow chart of your income was this like strictly from monetization from ads or did this include more stuff too of course so for for me i i i leveraged youtube to sell a course okay that makes a lot of sense thank you yes um um i got a question too go for it uh okay so yesterday i was watching a live stream and you talked about how like if uh there are two youtubers in the same like genre or category they are working in yeah so they kind of promote each other right yeah so uh my question is like uh you know we learned from those people per se so we did a little sense of insecurity at first because these are like the people we learned from so we get the sense of what value would i provide yeah and like that particular instance second is that um like youtube in general seems so saturated at this point is if you want to do something okay i get that you can't do something totally unique per se um but like a tutorial about something versus a another tutorial about the same thing kind of feels the same yeah at the point so what's the point of like making something that already exists and how does that provide value to you that's a great fantastic question herman have you ever helped anybody in real life like ever a friend parent i actually have been programming since i was seven i manage a game dev server on discord not much about 1k people or so so yeah we're usually like talking to okay and do they come uh so give me an example of like a simple question somebody has asked you that has brought like that you have answered for them give me a simple example where you've helped somebody um right so like i met a lot of junior tips in my last job and it was mostly like like as a programmer it's not about learning the language it's about learning the way you're supposed to write code like it's problem solving more than anything and they usually have the issues with how can i do x now instead of trying to explain them how to do eggs i tried to explain why it works this way and what other approaches let me ask you let me ask you a question that the the question that they asked you was an answer for that available if they looked online hard enough yeah exactly cool but it was more like i was right next to them we're working together so this is something i want to share with you right if and i want everybody who's listening to this to think and recall a moment where you might have helped somebody with anything in life and maybe it was a question that was already out there that you answered for them so in this case and i think you kind of right i see you guys nodding your heads and kind of feeling it so herman this is where i'm getting what i'm getting at here is there's plenty of times where we'll answer questions that already the answers to them exist most of our life right right but maybe the way i share it maybe the way you share it hits home for that person right where the world is not so like what i want to say is the world is not like made of robots that are like well this information is already indexed duplicate question cancelled form deleted that's what happens a lot in that [ __ ] forum discord and all that world i i mean being a programmer for too long kind of gives you that mindset yes yes it's a really it's a toxic mindset um and so for me even though i was part of the programming community i was never a part of the programming community ever like i never joined any forums because it always just felt like it was just elitist and like any time if you even remotely have a similar thought like literally even a similar even if you use like sometimes similar words but it's a different question like i've gotten shut down or my questions got deleted and they're like no figure it out like so so many haters so many haters so many haters right those voices is just not a kind place to be on most of the time right remember what i was talking to about uh stack overflow so like let me just give you some background i'm a senior mobile developer i've made some of the biggest apps on the planet disney plus sonos like giant apps i asked a question on stack overflow and they deleted my question spotlight imagine if i have a question about something that has to do with mobile it's very specific and then someone's like oh uh yeah it's a duplicate question like no big deal you suck you know like how is this possible like i am i am more senior than whoever shut that question down and so that's that's the world you live in so when you're answering questions you can't think about it like oh this way or that way it's very important to always know that maybe somebody likes maybe someone's searching for something right right when you answer it so it's it's your answer that they want it might not be some weird technical stack overflow it's like a friendly video answering something yeah i know that that's what i've done yes you know i did the exercise last night and you know it's like that's the beginning of the journey nice beautiful answer um there's also this other thing that like it's psychology at most um like most people don't like the sound of their own voice and that kind of has to go like a long way understanding why not more people like your god videos per se because it's hard to put out like put yourself out there considering what the internet is you like your voice no i like i have social anxiety even being on this i feel i just joined it because i was like maybe i can put myself a bit forward maybe that would help me open up i also stream from time to time but yeah i don't know how this is gonna go but right it's okay yeah that makes sense like how do you like one is like you know as i said like the market is kind of saturated so how do you find your niche or like in general how do you find okay this is what works for me personally like how do you know this works it's not about the experimenting phase it's about like evaluating that experimentation data per se right okay so i love this and few things here one i actually think um your voice is very interesting like i actually really it's almost like hypnotizing i don't know what it is so i agree i actually think you your um your voice is really interesting second uh let's not spotlight me let's spotlight the person who's question i'm answering thank you so that that's one important thing i want to i do want to say second is what i want you to work on right i don't know if you were here yesterday um yesterday's call so similar thing i want you to get like out of your head right similar thing i had a conversation with devin about i want you to get out of your head and into your body youtube is uh there's this world of perfect science perfect math perfect programming and then there's art youtube is a lot of art combined with maybe some like mathematical thinking meaning like using historical data to like make like videos that you kind of know are gonna work but there's a lot of art there's a lot of human element to it so less thinking in terms of like precision data guaranteed something's gonna work uncertainty is something you have to like actually embrace uh i mean it's just probabilities at the end of the day you kind of have to do it to know that it works or yes for you honestly i want you to make youtube like i think right now for you i wouldn't even have a discussion about like planning [ __ ] out and and what's the best way for you to go what i know like my anxiety is so worse i have like i just recently bought like an entire setup i got a good mic i got like good enough recording equipment and stuff yeah but just i can't bring myself out of my own bubble and i'm aware of this yes but like i try to help myself but there's no way i can physically make myself do it like i got like i need a more sort of force pushing me towards doing it yes because that's what i feel the lack of yes um but then again like we all have priorities in life per se and i do want to do youtube it's something you really really want to do yeah a lot of friends have been asking me to do it as well but then again um it's just the fear of being judged but that kind of comes with being human i guess yes and i know like that would go away with time but initially like i know it takes a lot to upload your first video per se but some people just do it effortlessly and that kind of makes me more anxious about it yeah so right there's a lot of like comparison of what other people are doing and stuff like that's happening i know the fear that you feel not social because i've worked my ass off to come a lot of my social fears including like approaching strangers and crazy [ __ ] that helped me get out of it but i know the fear because i am extremely scared to jump in a pool in my own house it's only a six feet pool and it's it doesn't go deeper than that i've had traumatizing experiences where i've like drowning experiences and so i kind of know how to swim but i'm like terrified i jump right it took me 20 minutes to jump in and i felt like my whole life was going to end i jumped in and literally like i wanted to i panicked so hard it's on video so maybe i'll share with you guys one day right but i did it a few weeks ago and i couldn't just stop like hyperventilating and i got out i was proud that i did it but it was scary as [ __ ] i honestly found you to be the best person to for me to be asking questions too per se yeah because we have a lot of common background heritage from where we come from like i come from punjab which is you know we have like a lot of history where if you're from bishopville right and like that sort of mindset that they build you when you're little like the whole school thing and yeah it kind of gets to you at the point yeah and that's what kind of i'm suffering with i've tried a lot to do harmony hormone right we're gonna saw one few we're gonna take deeper questions later and i would love to get in it with you but what i want you to work on is if you can maybe even find a partner from here or just make a video even if you're not gonna publish it okay for you i want you to like actually commit to an action step and say it in the comments that you're gonna commit to um okay so if it's about commitment let's do this right i'll make a video by tomorrow this meeting and maybe we can show it to others maybe that would help okay yeah i think so right yeah i can try like i can try something like i can try putting something to it in a day or so it's fine beautiful how to edit videos and stuff so awesome that is exciting that is really really exciting yeah like that's exhilarating it's beautiful all right everybody give them a round of applause this was amazing herman if you want to make it even easier if you want to make it even easier i i i'll offer to jump on a zoom call with you and i'll just ask you questions let's do a quick interview the same way you're doing here that would look great yeah we want everyone to have one piece of content starting right now yes so let's go right yep okay okay all right harmon thank you so much for jumping on appreciate your brother yeah i like let others take the stage don't want to hug awesome thank you appreciate it um cool so um guys can you see the screen actually you guys can't see the screen i need to share it boom screen share awesome do you guys enjoy that segment with harman yes nice awesome yes is it i just wanted to ask a question okay real quick is it relevant to this here uh not this okay but let's you okay let's address it a little bit later okay i'll take on a lot of questions afterwards i promise cool i'll take on a lot of questions so yeah this is if if you guys have a question relevant to this then we can get into it but otherwise just hold your questions for a little bit later please what wait did olivia say something no okay cool i think she had background he's trying to say something okay i'm trying okay go for it um as far as growth i know you said that um to build a brand with youtube but this is like instagram i know you said you used tik tok but did you use your instagram to um actually build your brand on there as well um i didn't start really taking instagram seriously like late into 2019 yeah so almost every single dollar almost like 95 of it is attributed to i attribute it to youtube okay and somebody asked me this when is a good time to launch it i launched it with like about 10 or 20 000 youtube subscribers says are i know you asked me that question so uh that's a good place to start it at like you can once you get a little bit of momentum behind you uh because i know because i've done it enough i know that if you do launch it it works it's almost like freaking science why i have some people sell something really quickly is because i like for you to see and believe yourself that it's possible so that's why i push people to like do just a little bit of sales right in the start so you can like see what it feels like and get that it's real like oh my god the money is actually in my bank account like from this thing that i did online it's real i can now calm down and just like focus on the actual work so that's why i have people do it but if you can have more faith then i recommend you like just put up content and grow and wait to actually do the part where you ask for the sale the longer you can wait the better your launch is gonna do the more you're gonna crush cool so that's that's an important part of the game so for me you know this was comprised of i think uh two i think we did like two two product launches that entire year and then boom that's actually what happened and maybe i can show specifically um let me see if i can show this without any uh okay cool let me actually just check there's a way i can show it in like a good way okay cool cool all right so what i'm doing right now is i'm preparing to show you guys something and um i'm just doing it in a way where it's like i don't reveal any sensitive information so just give me one second and i'm gonna pop it open for you guys okay all right there we go all right cool so this is what that year looks like now i'll show you guys boom all right so are you guys taking a look at this right now yeah yes so this is the first year um so actually i made more than i thought in the first year i said the wrong number apparently uh how many of you guys would like to make this in your first year yeah be happy cool um so whenever i say that stuff i'm always like man i just hate sounding like those get rich quick people i [ __ ] hate that so like that sounds like ah but um it's again just to nothing i hate bragging so it's really not to do that it's just to share with you like what i came across and so i want to just share that all right and please don't take it like bragging or anything so um i did the first product launch i think in march so like for example here's what i want you to look at right so let me just erase this and go here you guys see these like this spike right here and then this spike right here and then this spike right here right yes okay so now what's happening with these spikes is actually this is this is the first time i'm asking people to buy this is the second time i'm asking people to buy and this is the third time i just asked people to buy does that make sense yes totally yeah and what kind of call the action was that um so it's i mean it's a whole product launch but like basically the simplest way i can put it is i like literally i just ask for the sale so i'll give you value and then i'm like hey if you're enjoying our thing like this is our course you can join it now we can get into copywriting at some point and you can of course get better at the sales process you can get better at the copywriting process but the simplest way i can put it even if you're a [ __ ] like you don't want to learn any marketing you don't want to learn any copywriting i believe that you might not have numbers like these but you will still do really good and be able to replace your job by just asking for the sale at some point okay so it's like a product launch do any of you guys know brands like hype um it's called what is it called no not hype supreme my bad supreme they're so built on hype that i literally call them hype uh but do any of you guys know the brand supreme for clothing yeah i mean they just sell because they have a brand right so like they stack the logo they built the brand and they made it so hot and then they do these drops so like the whole year they sell only a few times they don't actually sell very often they just do these like big drops and that's it so and then it's over so for me i just do these drops in between that time i just shut the [ __ ] up and work and give value does that make sense so like he yeah so like here it's me making zero like so i know that you guys want to make like um so like here right so let's see this was one of my first weeks i did the launch so march march 2017. so 163 97 507 584 3697 so basically let's just say in one week of doing this launch i probably cleared like seven thousand dollars is that a good number for one week yeah cool that's bothered cash come on so that's a good number okay great oh actually it was uh no no i'm sorry it was actually like uh fifteen thousand dollars my bad fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars in one week right that was the first launch but who here wants to make zero dollars for three months i don't yeah biggest racing is it depends if i have enough money in the bank too right so like it's like a lagging indicator guys it's like you have to remember you got to put the work in first then you're getting cash in on the work yeah so that's the really hard part for most people where it's like okay this part here is the part where you literally do zero dollars and then you work your ass off like in terms of content value engaging with people making sure you're answering their questions all of that right so that's the first launch now the second launch i did in the first year was right here so let's go there so the oh this this actually was a pretty good launch day one of the launch we did seven thousand seven thousand dollars whoops and then 2500 and then 5500 and then 4100 and then how would you guys like to have a day 19 000 a day yes why not so that so this chunk over here for the second launch i believe was um probably sixty thousand dollars the sixty thousand dollars sounds good in one week sure that's awesome hopefully sounds good so that's that was week two or sorry launch two and then anybody want to guess what launch three did you get you guys can see launch three is pretty massive day one was 22. so like i'll just show you like this launch there was one day where we on just one day i think did 40 000. so that's like one of the days and then one of the so like yeah just give me what are you guys saying overall like take a guess on the launch number three 180 what would you say 180 000 180 000 any other guesses thousand 97 seven thousand what else 500k what else all right so 100k nice all right so for this one it was actually 150 000. cool and that was um this was over the course of one week how does that sound hundred fifty thousand over the course of one week perfect he's just perfect i like that cozy just a quick question yes um like you're doing like different uh courses per se right so are all these sales coming in from the most recent course you created yes or is it like a compound of the previous ones as well because like people would discover you so they might buy something else as well right yeah like they don't necessarily have to buy just one thing right but mostly all the best results we got was just by focusing on one product at a time that's why we exploded like and just crushed everybody else in the market because like just uh i get that like yeah you did a call to action for like a particular course and people joined that course what i'm asking is if you like let's say you created a python course per se and um does the value of it like does the new users you get time dies off because youtube kind of keeps promoting your video if it's good right right like there's no into it it's compound it will grow with time yes um so do the sales like grow little as time progresses yes your daily sales or it gets stable at the time so i'll tell you this right okay okay cool i got you i got you so here's here's what it is so this business model like like doing nothing and then launches called feast or famine business model okay so like for example in between here i'm making pretty much zero dollars in between here i'm making now a little bit more than zero dollars it's probably a few thousand dollars uh in between here i'm also i'm now making a little bit more so it's a few thousand dollars more right so they are compounding over time yes so as it goes if we go forward and forward into time like for example let's just say we go to like maybe 2019 and we just take a look at this and let's go maybe oh man it's taking a really long time to load but you guys can see in the background like what happened with the days where we weren't making sales it those are the days that are now starting to get filled out does that make sense right right so that's that's what i was asking yup so that's kind of what happened so yes the compound effect is very real i say youtube is like uh compound interest on steroids right i mean it's a digital product you don't have to manage any inventory you don't have to like refill your inventory it's just one thing and yeah that's actually the day so i love what you just said there was one day where it like really blew my freaking mind where i went from um i went to i went to go skydiving with my friends so i went skydiving with my friend i wanted to surprise him for his birthday and i went skydiving and they had to make us watch these videos to make sure that like we understand that we can die so there's this like this old dude like it's like nine years old has this giant beard and the entire the entire video he's just talking about like death he's like so in the case of death you have to inform your family members and put your contact information so we can contact them i'm like holy [ __ ] like i'm already excited and nervous because my first time the whole time this guy's just talking about death and i'm like man this is kind of scary should i do this and then we finally like going through this crazy adrenaline rush finally get in the airplane and what was the scariest part anybody here skydived anybody here skydived let me see a view of everyone does bungee jumping count that rope thing adam did frank did nice so um so it's got it's just so it's like a crazy thing i'm uh when you do it it's like ton of fun it's really enjoyable but the scariest part for me about skydiving was actually the part where the plane is going up because it's anticipation of the fear so like that was just such a scary part and i was like oh my god what the hell's gonna happen every and then i saw the trees go from like trees and cars go from cars to like they turn into these tiny little like invisible molecules from this and i'm like we're gonna jump from here and then we saw the one of the instructors jump out and my heart i'm just sitting there my heart's like beating my palms are sweating and i'm literally thinking we should quit and go back but it was so scary and it would have been so like at that point it would have been too embarrassing to go back then it would have been to just jump out so i was like let's just jump out we jump out and like um i remember the moment the video was there stacy says i'm terrified of heights i remember that exact moment right where the camera or sorry the because i saw my video in the camera later but i was about to jump out of the plane and you see all life just leave my body like literally my face just goes it's like i've seen death and then he pushes me off and i'm like like crazy my face is everywhere my cheeks are like deformed i'm like laughing i'm having fun it's like literally the best moment of my life that i've experienced but i'm scared at the same time i have this brilliant experience right then they pull the parachute at that one point and then it's just like calm it's like smooth sailing we get to the bottom they interview us unbelievable experience and when it comes and then when we leave i'm thinking about man it was such an amazing experience it was so fun and then i thought about i'm like how much did that cost so i asked my friend i'm like i forgot how much it cost him like how much was it and he's like oh it was like 300 bucks and i was like whoa hold on you're telling me that they gave us an experience of our life they had to risk multiple people in the airplane and the skydivers life to jump with us and help us they had to like have an airplane they had to have like fulltime people that are trained that are doing thousands of jumps they have to pay them there were so many things that they had to take care of and they charged 300 and at that exact same moment i looked at my phone and i just got a sale of 500 for my course and i was like that is kind of crazy it's kind of almost like in a way i was like is that unfair is that ethically wrong because i'm not risking my life i don't have inventory nothing happens to me there's no risk and it made me start realizing wow it is so great of an opportunity that we have where you can actually have what's in your head whatever value that you have you can share with people they'll pay you for it and there's no like there's there's no inventory none of that right so that's one of the things that i thought about that i feel like is very cool about the opportunity that we have and the world that we actually live in uh gabi go ahead hi cassie i have a question how many subscribers do you have when when you launch your your course so there were three launches which launched um the first one cool so the first launch that i did i believe that by that time i had maybe somebody can verify this for me but i believe that i had between 10 to 20 000 youtube subscribers um yeah i believe that's what it was and how much did your cause with your curse cost so this launch was the course cost 47 which i realized was a mistake like you should charge much higher but then just make your course inc like way better but just charge way higher it's like way better to charge way higher you get higher quality customers you can give them like they're not going to be a pain in the ass at all and they're there to like be serious and learn and be committed when you pay you pay attention right so has that happened with you guys where you paid a lot for something and then you like really paid attention to that same thing right where you get that same advice for free people even when you give that same advice for free to people they don't really care they're like yeah yeah yeah gabi i already know you that's cute but then if you charge somebody for it they're like oh my god that was life changing so those are the kinds of people you get it truly changes their life supporting them is so much easier and it's a breeze so um so yeah like that was one big lesson we learned but that was my that was the price of my course at that time gabi okay perfect thank you very much you got it hey kelly i have a quick question who is this uh vicente ramos okay vicente go for it hey um so i if i i was one of their students from prophet um proper priority with python and at that time when you made your courses did you have a team or was did you do like a certain amount of video yourself and then you got the team before like did you get a team after you started making a certain amount of money or like that's a great question that's a great question so i knew i i know to think of everything in terms of skills everything like for example right uh when i all money is right what is money guys money is literally nothing but just a lagging indicator of skill and value if you develop enough skill in a certain area and then you give that value to somebody then they give you money back in return for example if olivia's really good at mindset she has worked all really hard to develop those skills she's probably studied tony robbins she probably has looked at gary vee she's probably studied books a bunch of stuff right she talks about the law of attraction she had to spend a lot of time developing that skill yes or no she had to develop a lot spend a lot of time developing that skill right yes then she had to spend time giving that value to somebody and then she just makes money for that that so that's all that money is at the end of the day it's a skill that you develop if gabi has a skill of finances she had to spend a lot of time acquiring that skill and then she gave value to somebody and she got money in return so right so skill is the ultimate thing that you need to develop and then you get paid for it and all of that so when i think about skills i'm like okay if everything comes down to skills then what's the most important thing is for me to learn the skill of working with people because people are the most important that's how the ideas come and that's how all of the breakthroughs happen so if people are um everything and guys just one thing i do want to let you know i see olivia yeah cool so one thing i want to let you guys know is we're not done yet we're going to keep going but for day 5 happens tomorrow that's we're going to create your blueprint okay that's where we're gonna create your path to actually crushing it on youtube make sense guys so tomorrow's so tomorrow is gonna be a really important day tomorrow is probably the most important day so make sure that you guys have that already scheduled in same time 11 a.m tomorrow and we're gonna get started pacific right california time and if you guys have questions or anything bring those just wanted to say that as a reminder so vicente for me i realized that just like programming was a skill that i developed i got paid six figures for it youtube was a skill i developed and i got paid a lot for it i knew that people were one of the best skills to develop on my team and learning how to work with them because i knew that all the biggest people knew how to work with people like everybody who's created the biggest companies so i started hiring people as soon as i possibly could like literally even when i had 500 bucks or 50 bucks or 100 bucks i would hire people and work with them um cassie uh hold on hormone right now hold on right now it's vicente vicente go for it oh no thank you thank you for the answer and i appreciate it okay got it awesome um so yeah okay hopefully that brought you value and and you got value out of it um cool uh isa isa is it isa uh yes it's isabey and charlie hi issa okay go for it uh hi i have a few questions go for it okay uh one is how many minutes do you recommend for a an average youtube video as long as as long as that video as long as it needs to be okay yep so as long as that video needs to be so if you have a message that is only three minutes long then it's three minutes if you have a message that takes 45 minutes to come out then it's 45 minutes some of my best performing videos isa i have videos that are 15 minutes that are at 2 million views and then i have vid i have a video that's 12 hours literally it's a 12 hour youtube video and it's at 1.8 million views wow that's great so as long as it needs to be okay and uh my other question is a bit uh personal why did you choose to open a channel with your name rafi kazi and uh which uh what did you what do you suggest can i open a channel with my name or with an adjective or another name which is not mine got it great question so for me the coding channel it makes a lot of sense for it to be called clever programmer and that's just like now it's a brand and so for example tomorrow there could be other teachers teaching on there and growing it like coding is not something that like is gonna be you know what i'm saying like i'm not coding all the time i'm running a company like now i'm running a company i'm focused on actually impacting people's lives i don't care if it's me coding and impacting lives but i just care that there might i might inspire their developers to create content on there so then they can change lives my channel rafikaze is on my life's journey oh yes that's why it's called rafikaze it's whatever journey that i'm on so like for me the thing that is the deepest and most satisfying right now is i love inspiring people which is something that that i've always loved i love teaching but right now for me the thing that i'm the most passionate about and i believe in the most is people starting on their youtube journeys like i understand thank you so much you know what i'm saying like i love i love seeing what it does to their confidence i love seeing what it does to their like income to their business how they can provide for their families i love everything about it so so yeah so rafikaze is all personal and slash like my life like whatever is happening and then clever programmer is a brand for coding okay thank you very much yep you got it and i have a followup question to that girlfriend mark does your rafa quasi channel also like do you have intentions for it to feed into your clever programmer channel like maybe people who discover you as a person will then be like whoa this guy's really great at programming or are you trying to keep them separate um i mean i'm not really trying one or the other i'm just trying to grow them independently and separately almost like imagine two kids right you like if you have two kids you don't necessarily want the little brother to just like follow under the shadow of the oldest brother you really want them to be two unique individual people uh that do their own thing that's my longterm goal with both of the channels i don't want them to worry about necessarily having to even know about each other they can just like they should be both good enough to grow from each other i think from clever programmer it's really awesome that from clever programmer there are a lot of people that are jumping into the rafikaze side yeah cool well thank you man yeah um cesari says qazi what do you think of you to me and cesar you can jump on somebody can spotlight you says what do you think of udemy it's nice but for me hard work can't be paid 10 to 12 euro precisely for this reason my question is how can you fight this platform you make use you make your own platform which is essentially cesare here um okay he's not here but i'm gonna answer his question i mean wait he literally just he's not on video i asked him to turn video on but i mean he should be he okay got it got it got it okay so that's fine i'll answer this question um so what do i think of it i think you need to have your own platform like if i'm on udemy i i'm at the mercy of udemy i don't get the email list i literally like the number one most important thing is the thing that differentiated me is i use youtube to grow my email list okay so this is something i want to share with you guys because i think we're in the important sections of this call now and so i want to actually share more advanced strategies that i uh alluded to yesterday so let's go to my videos and i'll go here all right and i'll share my screen with you guys right now cool so if i show you guys my videos and we sort by like most popular so in this video i got about two million views the most important thing that i'm doing here is this right here you guys see this thing here yes that is the biggest secret like this is the thing that a lot of people don't understand i'm driving the people to go and join uh an email list so then i can let them know later like if there's a course or if there's an opportunity i can get the word out all of the revenue guys comes from majority of the revenue at least in my case i think in most people's case will come from your the people you have on your email list okay so this is the one important advanced thing i want to show you guys if you're thinking about starting your youtube channel it's a really smart idea to send people on your website give them something in return for free right like you give them something return for free so if i go to cleverprogrammer.com i'm giving you something for free how to become a javascript developer in 2020 right you join it because it's a free training does that make sense i'm giving you something valuable but in exchange i get your email for it discounts are not a thing for discount like i stay away from that type of stuff like discounts and things like that but free training is a good thing to do here's another example right how many of you guys here oh crap it's gone again no help all right so hopefully this will be good how many of you guys here i actually want to get a sense of this raise your hands if you came here from uh if you found me from a facebook ad raise your hand if you found me from a facebook ad to for this training okay a few people got it um and you guys can drop it in the chat too if you how you found me if you found me from if you found this training the five day training i mean from a facebook ad uh drop it if you came from clever programmer how many of you came from clever programmer a bunch of people okay most people got it awesome so wherever you came from the important thing here is to understand that i get you guys are getting value and there's something that i'm giving out for free it's a five day challenge so you don't give anything for it but you're like wow this is awesome getting so much value and you get it for free so then it's a fair exchange it makes you want to be like okay when you put that you're on an email list right so then on the email list if we have a course uh which we're actually gonna drop which i'm super [ __ ] excited about i'm making the best course i'm literally like this is gonna be my life's work in one course and we're gonna be launching it and i'm gonna be talking about it towards the end of the challenge with you guys it's going to be called i'm thinking about calling it youtube masters academy i'm so excited about this and i want to put everything in there but those of you who are interested in going further you guys are going to jump into that course those of you who are not interested in it won't jump into it if you don't feel like i've given you enough value but the whole point of having the email list is it gets the word out does that make sense and i'm not i'm not blocked by youtube i'm not blocked by i'm not dependent on instagram i'm not dependent on that necessarily email list is it allows me to connect with you directly okay so this is one like advanced tactic that i wanted to share with you guys when it comes to you actually growing a youtube channel is build the email list from day one of your channel like from day one if you do that that's a really good idea um a tool that i recommend that you guys use to build your email list we use this tool i recommend using convertkit there are many other tools this is the best just take my [ __ ] word for it i know every goddamn tool on the planet i've been through every rapid hole you can imagine i know the insides and outs and every automation and every fancy tool like i have exhausted myself going through it so if i can help you just make a decision fast and simplify your life like i had an email tool that i had to pay 48 000 a year and it was awful and it was a nightmare to then like pull myself out of it at a later point so this is the easiest one this is the best one i believe that it lets you get started for free so i would highly recommend using convertkit to um to build your email list and get people on there people are okay so somebody said i came from email all right i found it from youtube youtube clever programmer all right mailchimp oh somebody said using mailchimp yeah get off mailchimp mailchimp sucks like don't be on mailchimp it's yeah it sucks uh i mean all right if you are a human being sitting face to face i'd probably say it's okay mailchimp is all right if it won't take too much energy for you to get off of it then get off of it now um yeah so that's kind of the actual answer i would give you if you were sitting face to face um and yeah mailchimp has like some funny stuff with like how the duplicate lists and yeah all right found from instagram ad awesome yeah even even i would i would recommend convertkit guys i know about mail gun i know about spark whatever i know about uh you know like every pla all of the platforms i've went through like ontraport and all of them this is the easiest one to use i recommend it at the end of the day decide whatever you want this is my personal recommendation for you uh this is a good one the other thing i would recommend guys is for you here are the steps right you have to make so here are the steps for you you got to have a youtube channel okay this is what your road to one million looks like if you guys want to take notes at this time it would be a good time to do that so youtube content this is your number one and most important step if you [ __ ] up every other step every other step including like not having a product not building an email list you will be golden you will still be golden if you don't get this part right and you don't put this part on a pedestal no matter how much i help you or you get fancy in business and marketing that every like because it's gonna be that's gonna be hard okay so that's step one we'll take questions later guys we're gonna take questions later we're gonna take questions later um so step one step number two is if you actually want to make the sale guys how can somebody pay you what do you need for somebody to pay you or actually before we get to the payment before we even get to the paper uh before we get to the payment part let's get let's get to the part so that's the right answer i just asked the wrong question right now so second part is you need to have a relationship with the people a way to communicate with them all right so this is the thing we just talked about right now so number two we need uh client list yes client list okay cool so that's the second most important thing so i will say email list client list prospect list you guys can call it whatever you want so this is step two of something that you're gonna need okay youtube content build your email list if you own the email list and tomorrow youtube gets destroyed facebook gets banned instagram gets shut down tick tock gets blocked in america you're gonna be fine you're always gonna have a business you're gonna be completely fine email list is yours nobody can take it away and and gabby another cool thing is you can put in your excel sheet and save it there and it'll be yours forever um cool so those are the two things number three now let's get to the point of what do you actually need for people to pay you like literally what is the thing that you need for people to pay you some of you guys said it for the last step it's for this here check out the product the product cool so yes so secure checkout all of that is going to be you know kind of like part of the product but i'm not i don't want to get too much into the weeds of it so at a high level this is what it looks like guys all right you make youtube content people like it let's say 10 000 people watch it right 100 people now might join your email list does that make sense they might be interested in going further getting a free training from you like gabi could have a free training on an excel sheet frank could have a free training on how he got his 170 000 job that's by the way that's a phenomenal free training to put out um that you could give out so that right then number three product 10 000 people might watch your [ __ ] 100 people might join your email list and one person might actually buy your product okay and this might actually mean for you whatever 297 597 um whatever right i but generally the best thing i can do for you is if i can get the thought of making a 10 course outside of your head if i can do that for you that's the best thing i can give you forget about all of that and don't ever like do not have a course if you're gonna work with me or you want to follow me longer term don't have something under 100 bucks why it's going to make your life miserable you're only going to do it most of the time because of lack of selfesteem because you don't believe that you could charge more guys louis vuitton purse i mean what the [ __ ] is in that purse what is it what is in the you guys tell me what is in that purse that's eight thousand dollars what's in that purse unicorn tears there's nothing in that purse so why are you so scared to put your course over a hundred dollars when giving us so much value louis vuitton doesn't give a [ __ ] what walmart is doing they're both respectable businesses in their own regard so don't give a [ __ ] what udemy is doing with udacity it's their business let them do it that way they want to sell it for ten dollars cool are there coding boot camps that are selling their coding bootcamp for fifteen thousand dollars yes their goddamn are so you if you keep looking at the ten dollars that's all you're gonna think about you're never gonna be able to get out of it i want you guys to stay away from that like that's like a slum like that's a sewer like stay away from fighting on pricing stay away from stay away from that land that's a really really bad bad place to be it's like those people you give them five dollars and then they make your life miserable like you know your friend just like bugging you hey can i have my five dollars back hey when when did you do the thing that i asked you like they go crazy over it whereas somebody some of my best clients or people who pay me like the mo like some of my best clients are people who pay me like 20 000 i almost don't hear from them i have to follow up with them and i'm like hey are you still there like we're working on more stuff for you and they're like oh [ __ ] really cool so those are the people you want to work with and then you bring them your best work because you're in a good head space so this is as simple as i could make it now this is a good point i want to take your questions but keep them about this guys so if you have some questions now is the time go for it yeah i asked this in chat but um you were saying did not really have low value products but all of my products are 99 cents because i produce music and stay away from that stay away from that stay the [ __ ] stay the [ __ ] away i'll tell you something my brother he wanted to do color grading okay he wanted to show people how to do better color like color their videos okay so you guys know like when you watch a video and it looks like you're like i don't know why but it looks like it's a hollywood video and it looks so good like those music videos and you're like i don't know what it is about it it looks like [ __ ] sick that's my brother my brother does that [ __ ] all right so he wanted to start when he was i i inspired him to get to doing youtube right that was my first thing that i helped him with like inspired him enough to do this so he got started i'm like yes then when it came to the product he's like you know everybody's selling these uh luts and i think i want to sell these luts they're these like these looks that are essentially like plugins so think of it like plugins and he's like i want to sell these plugins and he's like everybody sells them for like 99 cents or two dollars and stuff like that okay i told them i'm like please bro i'm like i love you but you know that um how should i say this instead of um making a million dollars you'll make um 97 that year and i'm like i [ __ ] love you but that's actually what's gonna happen but he's gonna hop on itunes and pay more than a dollar for a song you know so don't do it i i would go you know i mean depends what you want to do but i would go a different direction like for example you can keep playing that direction and if you're [ __ ] rock star then you'll blow up right but if you can teach that skill to people teach skill like actually give them a transformation now my brother gives them give instead of selling luts which is cool but like now he actually gives out transformations and you can join his program and become a colorist you can join this program and now you actually have the skill to go out there and charge other people and color their [ __ ] right like we show people how to become a developer people if we give them like a little plugin they'll pay us one dollar but if we can give them a transformation they're gonna pay us five hundred dollars seven hundred dollars one thousand dollars right so um that's what i want you to focus on when you think of creating a course i want you to focus on forget about how much stuff you got focus on what is the transformation you can give when you guys go to the dmv to get your license do you care if they keep you like for two hours or is it better if they leave you in one minute and just give you the updated license what is better updated live in one minute would you literally pay more if they could [ __ ] kick you out of there in like 30 seconds would you literally pay more yes yes everybody it's like a nightmare going to these legal things and sitting there for hours same thing here if you can give me a transformation i'd literally pay you more if you could help me do it faster or in a shorter amount of time so meaning you don't need to have 100 000 modules in your program in order to justify a price so uh that's the thing that i wanted to say okay for you mark i would go keep keep pumping out your songs but i think that if you can teach other people that skill that actually might be one of the most valuable things now i don't know maybe you're not into wanting to teach it which is fine but just know that if you were to teach that skill you could charge 500 because you can then create a transformation in people but for a song you probably cannot charge 500. that makes sense mark it's like imagine like i want to learn how to do ableton right i want to make old town road on ableton show me how to do that that's a course right like the finished product it's like hey here's a remix of volton road yes it's not as exciting that exactly so like inside that's that's money right there so like for example you could be like putting on tick tock content where you're like old town road and that's your content and i'm watching i'm like [ __ ] that's amazing i would put all that [ __ ] out for free and not charge for it and then in my course i'd be like i'll literally show you how i made this how i made the whole town road how i made this other song how i made this other song and i'll give you a breakdown and people would actually want to pay to learn how to do that like like i've paid for that so yeah you know what i mean like that's uh yeah of course i you know some help i don't know what the heck i'm doing i'm a beginner at it um so that's that's what people will pay for versus like a finished product is it's great you can i have also i have friends who are producers who also sell um basically like the ableton pack right all the the the song and all of the i don't honestly don't know what it's like the files to make the songs uh i do sell that also uh and they license things out um and they do they do pretty well there and it's not it's not 99 cents for sure it's right you know it's it's it's a hundred bucks and that that's sort of awesome so yes i agree with that that's right on the money so hopefully mark that helps you out we're going to go on to another question and then i want to keep continuing with this training all right guys so i want to make sure that just if you guys have questions right along these lines what mark asked i'd love to take them on the other questions i'll take them on a little bit later okay so that's the this go ahead go ahead because your thoughts on uh like patreon and stuff you know no uh because like some people do like projects don't share their servers and the source is kind of behind a payment wall or say yeah i mean like i'm not a fan of patreon like literally it's the same thing right so like and mark my brother actually did go on to make a million dollars my brother actually in one year my brother my brother actually just broke his first million in in about 12 months selling a 500 to 800 course on how to become a colorist and then he taught his skills in there he taught people what he did for his clients where their music videos got 280 million views he breaks that [ __ ] down in his course nice nice and he's putting out all the content out there for free so i do want to share that because that was the difference if we went the route of selling a 99 cent thing i swear to you that he would be at 8 700 in the whole year or max twelve thousand dollars max so okay i want you to think about that mark just to add into if you want more ideas for your channel if you just don't want to put like songs on youtube because copyright and stuff uh maybe you can do like a breakdown of stuff like how was the song created instead of like right not teaching them to create it but like these are the drums this is the bass these are the snares yes like what why what makes the song special stuff like that you know i think that would be able to break down select that awesome right all right so let's continue with this guys so uh here you guys cue cassie yeah what's up uh can i ask you yes you asked me three times bro you can ask me for sure go for it okay but uh i have a question in another topic not say youtube okay so let's address that later let's address all of those questions at a later time i want to keep going through this training and then we'll address your guys's questions okay thank you you got it you you got it all right so this is the path in a threestep process if i could break it down if you can be building an email list and launch the product when you get a like a thousand people on your email list or more that's a great time for you to actually launch a product i think that's a phenomenal time and you can launch your very first time and then go from there most of the times if you guys spend 95 of your time focusing on content you will win guaranteed if the entire year you forgot to build the email list and you forgot to build the product you cannot go wrong with this where you can go wrong is if you start with the product you can completely go wrong because you have no audience and nobody's interest so like all of that can be you can then go hey i made a product i spent months now you go out there and there's nobody out there that's gonna buy it so zero people would buy it so that's the path i don't want you to go down you can't just start an email list without having content so really the path that i recommend for people the path that i believe is the best is start with the content first start with the content link things to your email list so for example in your video like even for example gabi in your video or frank if you make your youtube videos make sure that like at the 45 second mark or the one minute mark you can say by the way i do want to say i have a free training on how i landed a 170 000 a year job if you're interested in that make sure you go here put in your name and email below and it's a completely free training you can sign up with that said let's jump back into the video does that make sense frank 100 i did not know about convertkit yes so that is like money right there that's like money like that is if you can just take that and actually apply it that same video like for example that video just keeps going and going if that video goes up to 2 million views that one video got you 50 000 subscribers and boom that one video will get you like 10 000 people or 20 000 people on your email list one video the one right video literally never thought of that man thanks so much it's it's crazy dude like how that works it's insane and then you just go to those 20 000 people and you're like hey i am making some [ __ ] that like i spent my whole life's work on it's pretty awesome do you want it most of them 99 of them will say no thank you 99.5 of them will say no thank you half a percent of them will say yes that's the only half a percent you need in order to do 200 000 400 000 800 000 1.6 million dollars 2.7 million dollars 10 million that half percent is the only percent that you need to say yes so let's go that's the only reply what do you say yes that sounds amazing i love that bro yeah that's that's the that's the right uh reply so that i would say is a really good thing to focus on build a content email list almost forget about your product at some point ask for the sale of the product and you guys will be good okay i hope that this got brought to you guys does this bring you guys clarity by the way on what the path to making income from youtube can look like does that give you guys clarity on it definitely yeah it's a great yes okay awesome um because it's one of those things that's really hard for people to go hey what is the best way to monetize what's the best way to do this what's the best way to do that and i think a lot of the other ways are really complicated but if you can have something where you can share with people and charge for it i believe it's the fastest way to get to your like whatever your goals are like whether it's your income goals business goals whatever okay i'm just reading the chat uh cause your thoughts on monetizing channel videos yeah i monetize most of my videos uh it brings in a little bit of revenue for our channel but because a coding channel it's very like it's like very little revenue i mean it's four thousand seven hundred dollars right now that we're making every month from it um but you know yeah so but like how many views we're getting we should really be getting like way more revenue if we had a higher cpm so if we had a channel on finance or something then the revenue is way higher like graham stefan with this gram stefan because he has a channel on finance for the same [ __ ] i get two thousand dollars in a month graham gets two hundred thousand dollars in a month for that so yeah so his ad revenue is like pretty pretty nuts um okay i'm looking at some of the questions how to use the email list use it as a link to both the content and the product no so that's a great question the email list is only for i'm gonna give you a free training when you give me your email you get the free training that's it and now they're on your email list the only number one goal of anybody ever going on your website is for them to give you their email that's it that's all your website's purposes your website's purpose is not for your website to look pretty is not for you to have a nice logo not for you to build your selfesteem not so you could share it at the dinner table i'm launching a business take a look at my website none of those are reasons to have a website the one and only reason for your website is so people can go to it and they can give you their email and that's it that's like where your website will start that's where your website ends pretty weird thing but that's all your content on youtube websites so they can get your you can get email and then you're good kazi how do you send email to us what service convertkit that's how i send you guys emails that's how you guys got the email from um from today i hope you guys got an email today but that's where you guys got it from who's coming here from by the way who's coming here from the text that i'm sending is anybody able to use those i want to get a sense of like just raise your hands and keep them raised if you saw the text or if you opened the text or you saw the text so i see adam keep your hands raised the whole time rocio stacey matulla coyote giulio okay uh misha xavier okay cool all right all right you guys can put your hands on thank you so much i just wanted to get a sense of it so it seems like it's a pretty good percentage of the people that are getting the text or responding to it so that's something i'm experimenting with but i love how it allows me to like just connect with you directly like yesterday i saw something from giulio and i just like actually responded to it you know and like it's just one on one like 11 30 p.m and i'm like oh that's easy just respond whereas from email that's like really it's it's a little bit harder uh text is not convertkit for text the service i'm using is called community it's like bleeding edge i've had to go down some weird rabbit holes to discover it but it is the best i was using super phone before and it was ridiculous it was like 300 for one like if i added it would go from 300 to like 380 if i just add an extra exclamation mark at the end like literally an extra period at the end it'd be like boom like each text would cost me between 100 to 500 to send to people so like if i had to invite you guys to the training it would cost me like four hundred dollars like literally to tell you guys hey there's a training like 400 like jesus so super phone i'm running away from community is much better um and much easier guys another service probably the most important one if you are thinking about launching a course um okay let me ask you guys that you are on this call what are you guys trying to uh sell like after this conversation like what are you guys thinking about selling like are you who here is interested in potentially using their knowledge to at some point maybe think about selling a course okay cool so a bunch of people here um awesome again there's many things you can sell one of the things for one of the things that's really easy is a course and i want to show you guys a platform you can use to do that and the platform that i recommend for you guys is kajabi that's the platform that we use okay so kajabi is why i like kajabi is it's going to be your website and where you sell your course all in one place so here and super easy to use so you can have your website for example i have cleverprogrammer.com this is hosted on kajabi so this is my website right and if i go to customer reviews blah blah blah fullon website and if you were a student and you wanted to access our courses you would just hit log in and be able to access the courses this is the only combination i found that combines websites and making courses so easy everything else doesn't have what this has there are a lot of alternatives out there teachable podia and then there are some other ones stay away from wordpress don't go to wordpress stay away run away you're gonna make your life hell you're gonna instead of trying to sell a course you're just gonna spend all your whole life away trying to make one [ __ ] plugin work stay away um also you i would have recommended squarespace until i discovered that on kajabi you can have a website all in one place so instead of going through the nightmare of what we went through having a squarespace and then kajabi and then having to integrate them into one which was like pulling teeth it's like root doing root canals really hard painful once things get integrated over long term much better if you guys just start with one thing and then it makes your life easier cool so that's what i recommend for you guys to go ahead um sorry quick question yes do services like squarespace or the other one you mentioned do they offer ssl certificates or no i think almost everything offers uh ssl certificates i've been building my own for too long yeah so yeah yeah there's all the it's like the curse of the developer or like there we always want to build everything ourselves and it's like one of the worst things you can do because then you're spending all your time on making it then you're spending all your time on like developing a service that already really exists and not really teaching or helping people a lot you know how many people would come to my website and they're like this guy is a joker he didn't even code his own website i'm out full stack developer more like using a service for ten dollars a month i'm like i don't care like i again you just need half a percent of the people to agree with you everybody can not agree with you and that's okay so um go don't go that route you're gonna spend all your time coding it up then you're gonna spend all your time maintaining it instead of spending time on making content caring about your customers anything that pulls you away from caring about your customers or the potential people stay away from that not worth it okay so all of that stuff is already made um and then just pay for it that's the beautiful thing you can just pay for it and you get it i just dropped all the links in the comment also on the channel oh thank you thank you thank you thank you that's perfect so yeah direct text messaging community um i am a bleeding edge marketer i am using the community platform and it's it works for me uh i don't want you guys to get too hung up or crazy over every single thing as long as you have an email list you're solid if you want to use the community thing you can okay but it's just cause like i i'm just sharing with you guys the most advanced [ __ ] that i've discovered now that i'm using so you don't don't feel like you need to jump on this right away all right awesome uh cool so those are the resources that will help you get started in your journey those are the resources that hopefully will make your path much easier if you're about to go down this path because if you get started with the wrong things it's so painful i remember trying to sell like trying to put a course somewhere and nothing i would do would just i'm like guys i'm literally just trying to create something that i can sell why is it so hard why'd i have to coach it up why why'd you have to discover these plugins and so everything was really really complicated and it took all the time and energy from me actually making content me actually providing value so avoid those rabbit holes pick the simplest platforms from either convertkit for email kajabi for hosting course and website and it makes things really really easy and yeah it um and then for payment processors if you're trying to collect payment because at some point people are going to want to pay you um so you know whether you're making a course on finance or programming or you know or are on music you're going to have people pay you so the payment processor i recommend are two so here's what i recommend and you guys can write these down for payment you guys need one stripe which is the best payment processor so get a stripe you have stripe already stacy oh [ __ ] nice um and then the second payment processor you're gonna need is paypal okay so these are the two payment processors um that are the best with kajabi both of them will plug in and get integrated so i recommend using that making an account on it so then you can collect the payment okay but step one is you're gonna need a youtube account so if you don't have a youtube account go make that first wait service i opened up chat oh there it is yeah so i i mean i have tried thrive cart alexandros i've tried sam cart all of that you can i just go everything kajabi now like even my checkout i had um i had squarespace where my website was i had kajabi where my course was i had sam cart where i collected the payment from for checkout and then yeah i was like it was a [ __ ] nightmare to it was it was yeah it was just too many different texts and it was so hard to do any type of tracking anything that i want to do that was more advanced was a nightmare so i just completely went not that route uh later like it took us three to four years to completely switch now we're just all kajabi i even tried the clickfunnels route kajabi just makes everything so damn simple and for me simplicity i put on a pedestal and speed above everything um and so yeah that's what i would recommend just simplify it and make it easier for yourself all right guys so how was this guy how was this for you guys was this valuable for you guys yes yes too much value beautiful okay beautiful i'm glad that you guys got value out of it now guys what i want to do is i want to get into some questions and you guys want to do youtube roast today as well yeah okay dope awesome so let's take on some questions now is the time you can drop them in the chat or you can just speak them out loud go for it i want to take on new people so i want to make sure that some new people we're taking on for questions go ahead like i haven't heard anything from rob and rama even though you have an amazing background i always see it and i love it um i haven't heard anything from lawrence or corey or issa or alicia or raphael reynold so anybody who hasn't asked a question before i think it's a great time to ask one but go ahead guys i know we have questions guys you guys had your hands up a little bit earlier yeah i think the uh question in the chat from md is pretty good okay cool so md asks is it okay to put different niches into one channel or is it better to put them in different channels um i think it's better if you just have one niche and a channel that's usually it's gonna give you the best clearest growth you could try to do it but it's it's very hard like for example i tried to add personal development in my coding channel and it just always like sucked always like performed horribly so i kind of like just stopped completely i got there was a lot of stuff that was really meaningful to me on the personal development side but at some point i just kind of had to not talk about that same thing with i wanted to talk a lot about freelancing but there was just like no matter how much i wanted to talk about it not a lot of people wanted to listen to it because people just wanted to get jobs and so that was something that i would talk about but i started talking about it less on the channel um and i wanted to lean into where people were already listening to more of it and then help them with the thing that they needed help with so i think if you can niche down it's probably going to be better but don't again don't let that stop you from actually getting started all right beautiful so awesome can you show us which tool used to create or edit videos and how do you post it on youtube great question i use final cut pro to edit most of my content and if you want to use your phone to edit you can use an app called video leap it's amazing i have people using yive to create videos on youtube do you have an opinion about yive what tells you i've i'm looking it up right now your instant video empire huh the mass video marketing platform that launches your business success um i mean it looks funny to me but who knows it could be good you know so i don't know i i believe in just like using if you use final cut pro i think you're going to be good if you want to use another tool i'm not against it you i'm open to it you guys can check it out premiere is really good yeah so whether you want to use final cut or whatever use whatever you guys want i got on final cut i like it it's the easiest for me and i move on with it another thing i like about final cut is it's simple i believe it's way simpler than adobe premiere pro and so if you just want to not get let anything get in your way then i recommend just going with final cut um you were talking dimas says you were talking that we don't need to put money into ads before you get the money from content but how then attract viewers friends or friends trendy titles and picks and what else um good videos on good topics are gonna work and so yeah that's how you do it and it takes time but that's how you do it because at some point it has to be not your friends or friends or those people watching it and when those people start watching it then you're on the right track alicia i'm loving your setup bro you got you got the piano you got the mic what are you doing are you making youtube content right now or what's going on yeah appreciate it um so i don't have any questions but um i came across one of your ads on facebook and i clicked it and then you retargeted me and then you emailed me and i'm like okay this guy knows what he's doing so i just want to just chime in and say what's up keep killing it and uh thank you bro good stuff bro definitely oh that's sick i appreciate it man i appreciate that yeah i actually took a step back from youtube a little bit and just kind of wanted to really define my niche a little bit because i had a music channel as a rapper and then i had hit 10 000 subscribers and i'm like i started getting checks from youtube and i said let me try to really figure this youtube thing out and maybe go like go a different route because kind of like what a young man was saying it's kind of hard to get rich off of 99 singles you know what i'm saying so now i'm just i'm going to focus on like content creation and monetization and just like education so that's kind of where i'm at with it right now so appreciate it awesome and what are you thinking right now like are you going to get back on youtube are you going to create content where's your mind at so my mind right now well first of all i just had to upgrade everything so i got cameras and mics and all that because i didn't have none of that so now i have like a setup so yeah i just want to like i don't know man maybe you can uh answer that maybe you can give me some advice on what you think would be the best route to go i love content creation i love teaching people so um maybe that's kind of where i'm at with it to be honest with you beautiful and then okay cool and uh what's your situation looking like for money are you are you making i'm imagining that you're making your living from somewhere outside of youtube yeah so i'm an insurance broker hate it though you know yeah you know i sell insurance i don't like talking about insurance all day so yeah but i've always been a pretty successful artist in orlando i'm pretty big so i do shows concerts and stuff like that but it's like that battle of your passion and then your paycheck so i'm like i want my passion to overtake my paycheck type stuff so that's where i'm at so yeah yeah so i don't know if you listen to my pa like between that that transition between 2016 to 2017 where i dropped out and i i uh gave up all my clients i was making between 70 to 100 000 a year and i gave up and i dropped it to zero because my my channel started taking off it showed me signs of taking off because i had 3 000 subscribers in that month and so i realized there's something here and i want to see what happens if i pursue it fully brother you've got a channel with 10 000 plus subscribers there's a lot of [ __ ] people that believe in you yeah it's like eleven five now but it's nothing like where you're at but yeah um i'm gonna just try to like really go for it i think a a nice regimen is like maybe two to three videos a week dude and i i noticed that the algorithm really favors you when you're really putting content out consistently so i think that's my biggest thing just put out content and really just try to like find my niche and really try to see what people gravitate to and just do more of that basically please please like you already got something and you just need to keep going bro like just go just [ __ ] go like take out all that other voice bro and you just gotta go because dude you have you're on a winning streak don't quit when you're on a winning streak bro like don't quit so 11 5 that's 11 000 people voting like for me that means you have 11 000 people that voted for you that believe in you if you put those many people in one like stadium it would like fill up a freaking stadium so if you got that much vote of confidence behind you you need to going you need to keep going and figure out how to monetize it bro because i want you to like this is where i'm in between what gary garyvee says and what i say because i want you to figure out how to make a living from this because if you could do that then i know you will quit your insurance job that you [ __ ] hate so you could do the thing that you love fulltime that's what i would want for you yeah yeah appreciate it you got me pumped man you gotta you should be a motivational speaker or something dude you got me pumped over here yeah dude he is a motivational speaker he's speaking to you and he's motivating you yeah it's like absolutely amazing community and would say i was i was going to say like music there is a way to monetize it like we were just talking about before people are trying to do a little 99 cent hits the little things like that it's there's a way to say hey how can i make that right like how can i make that in ableton like something that you know really well or like how do i make my voice project more how do i get that that sound right like there's it's like turning that into a horse that's where the fire is that's where the fire it you is an amazing channel like i'm even looking at this right now and your [ __ ] is killing it yeah it's but like i said it's all over the place that's where i really had to just focus on my niche you know what i'm saying so bro okay so it's sometimes it's even okay if that happens i mean you can focus more on your niche if you want but i'm even looking at this and i'm like damn bro you're doing some great stuff and you're getting a lot of love from people 666 000 views is no joke to add that to a video this has to be a good video otherwise it just won't because that's the thing about youtube if the watch time isn't there it won't send it out to more people so you're making good content that people are watching um and then they're gonna go to your next piece of i mean i mean man this video is looking good too [ __ ] hold on managing social media god damn it i paid to not have to see ads why is easy still let me get my coins bro let me get my coins bro like two seconds in i already know what the video is about your title is dialed in your freaking tags are dialed in you got the beautiful ring light amazing my setup is looking great and start making money off of all of your youtube videos if so you're in the dude insurance [ __ ] br that doesn't make you this happy look at the smile that you got on your right place i'm gonna give you three easy steps on how you can monetize your youtube channel and start rolling in the dough coming right up yo love it that's not bro you're making me you're making me blush over here bro i bet you i bet you you don't talk to your insurance customers like this right no heck no hey you don't have you don't have the heart in it right like bro you're hitting that youtube hard i'm telling you bro you please you gotta just go all into this dude you just gotta do that like i'm so certain of it that if you were like if we again like uh my brother like if i would imagine you're like my you're my brother or you're my good friend we're just sitting right next to each other i would tell you the same thing i told my brother and i literally told him i'm like the best thing that can happen to you is if you all of a sudden lost your job like literally today you lost your job and he would laugh and he'd be like haha yeah then he actually called me one day and he's like dude i lost my job and he was like having tears coming out of his eyes wow and i um i mean i heard him have tears coming out of his eyes because he was sniffling and [ __ ] so i put my phone on mute and i was just screaming and it was the happiest day of my life dude i was like laughing i was like yes i was like [ __ ] god bless like we've done it hallelujah like let's go then i up unmute and i was like bro that [ __ ] sucks yeah yeah and that was the day he started making content on youtube that was the day he actually got started fast forward one year from now and he has a whole business and he doesn't have to worry about anything else so like i really do believe that the best thing that can happen to you which is would suck and most people will be like oh don't say that i like the best thing that happened to you is if they either stop you from having that job like today or you stop that job and i believe in your channel and what you have so much because you already have a track record for it too that this would be the fastest path for you to grow like the most logical path honestly i think it's the safest path appreciate it i'm gonna go for it man i'm gonna go for it bro appreciate it man beautiful bro it means a lot man it means a lot yes uh when was the last time you put out a video like i said i haven't really put out anything uh this year i'll get like some gear and i'll do like an unboxing or something but i've i've been gearing up and just right writing all my ideas down so i'm just gonna really just hit it hard like probably start in december i'm just hitting hard like like couple videos a week beautiful and i mean look at this you have content coming out i mean you put something one month ago yeah it was just a um like a little desk tour because i just kind of like i said i've been getting all my gear up and stuff so now i feel confident to really go for it because i have everything i need you know what i'm saying beautiful what's stopping you bro from making a video this week not nothing i'll do it let's do it i got it let's do it i'm getting so excited i'm kind of getting goosebumps because i can feel these moments and i love them like i'll tell you this when the day my brother made his first sale i started crying i had tears coming out of my eyes i swear to god because up until that point i was so close to helping him and all of this i even sat in chat to like support him and then the day that he got his first sale i cried because i knew that that day he's not gonna need my help anymore that day is the day that he sees it's possible for him and now he's just gonna go my job here is done so for you like why i'm getting so excited because i feel like we're so close to this win um can you is there a way you can make a video today bro uh yeah when i get the kids to sleep i got a little one so i get them to sleep yeah i do it dude that is sick um that would be so sick and can you bring that video in tomorrow uh yeah i can i'm gonna make a video about this whole interaction right here and i'm

even when you were just sitting there i'm like there's something there bro awesome bro thank you appreciate it man yes please bring that thing tomorrow i would love to watch it um and dude i like your channel a lot so i'm gonna subscribe to this channel but oh man that's dope man i appreciate it now you definitely gotta start producing content i'm not i'm not gonna let you down bro guys please don't please don't all right awesome great that was exciting um questions before we get into the roast okay cool so if there are no more questions we can get into it um um oh who go ahead vicente um sorry um i just have a quick question so uh i i know that we've been talking about like the process but um when you were working like did you have like a schedule you set up where like every time i'm gonna every day i'm gonna get home from work i'm gonna work on a video and i'm just keep doing that or did you just do it whenever you had free time i did it when i had i i built my entire channel i mean the start of the channel in one in one hour windows so i would i would have uh full time i was like going to college and then i would go and do parttime like work and i would do a lot of freelancing work and then i would come home by 8 or 9 p.m and then i had a 9 p.m to 10 p.m window so i'd leave home at 6 a.m come home at like 9ish p.m and then i would do between 9 to 10 p.m is when i would make my videos that's how i got got it started okay i see yep and then thank you and then two or three months in when i hit 3 000 or 5 000 subscribers that's when i just went all i just quit i just went full in because i saw i'm like if i'm getting momentum and i hit three to five thousand subscribers there's something here and i just gotta go all right thank you very much yeah you got it man yeah i'm still looking at that channel and i'm excited it's like the how to monetize youtube channel fast that video like yeah okay all right cool so um music channel all right guys now start dropping your links and let me know what type of roast you're looking for i know some of you guys already dropped it um and then we'll start from there so i see stacy stacy what are you looking for i don't have to go first um i'll take a dark roast i mean yeah i'll be okay all right cool let's do it okay so um cool how to so i i like i like overall how the title looks i think when you when you get cute with titles sometimes they don't actually perform well because people don't know what you're talking about i know you're talking probably about git version control i have popped the squat in my recliner and i am ready to introduce you unless there's something wrong on my end i think the audio is really low on this video like i think yeah i think something happened to my audio yeah okay github that has this great platform that's better that allows you to save all your i'm saying that i was there to work to process okay great so i would edit like this part out where i think you're looking at something or trying to open up something so if it's a video and it's not a live stream then i would edit that out or i would just do better preparation in the start yeah i didn't do too much editing on this one okay so either do so here's this here's the thing right if you don't want to do editing then you got to do a lot of preparation and mentally put yourself in that state so like if i'm not gonna do if i'm not gonna do uh if if i want my people to shoot a video of me but i don't wanna do a lot of preparation then i get myself in the zone and then you just give me a topic right so you're just like so somebody give me some topic here any of you guys can give me a topic here giraffes giraffes what else git and github get in github okay so if i have preparation then that's great if i don't have preparation then i just got to go on the spot but be energetically wired so i'm like just going so then you don't need to edit it so then i just make myself so good that you don't need you don't need to edit it as much so then if it's like yo guys here are the top five things we're gonna learn about giraffes in this video now before we get started make sure you hit like subscribe to the channel this is me stacy joseph let's roll the intro that happens right i like alicia's laughing because that's probably his intro so either you have to like get your energy up and then really commit and go all in um that's one way of doing it or two just make sure you edit like if you're feeling like oh my energy is i'm like um now we're gonna open up github now we're going to open up this and then if you're looking at the thing and it's not prepared ahead of time so make sure you edit that part out so then the video is like paced well so if i'm watching it then i'm actually going to commit to watching you okay because it seems like okay you care you're not gonna waste my time you're gonna be respectful of my time especially the first stage especially the first few seconds are so important so if in the first few seconds you lose my attention you don't hook me i'm not going to get past i'm not going to get to the other parts and also to have others be able to collaborate with you don't tell me how i go about getting it so audio needs to improve um audio is like really bad it's really hard to understand what you're actually saying plus i think you're sitting away from the mic so i would recommend that you can invest in a might like a yeti and i think that will go a really far a long way if you're anything like me i need to know step by step what i need to do is my github after that if your mic is there i think this video is going to start popping like there's something about good audio that just makes things pop so even when you guys saw like alicia's video we put on before yes he has really great lighting yes he has a lot of those things but it's the mic that does a lot of the magic where all of a sudden you're like whoa like for example i want you guys to notice the difference between my voice right now and i want you to notice the difference between my voice right now did my voice my that is it like really an is is it much more annoying to hear me now like it's almost like this sad sound far away yeah it's not equally echoey far away like weird right all of that and then all of a sudden i'm like how's it going guys what is up right it is just howard's turn like hey how's it going right yeah yeah so audio makes the most difference the most difference um and then yeah so i would focus on the video part of it later other than that i sometimes just skim through to see how i feel about the video so here when i see visually things changing that's a really good sign i would increase the energy in the intro because that there's there's no energy in the intro like and here it's almost like you you're like you forgot that you even had a camera on or something for a few seconds so that part is important other than that you're good add some visuals so when you say github github logo should pop up like have a github logo or a github image right there that's gonna be a better way to go so that's what i have for you okay okay cool all right let's go um all right i'm gonna go with muktum ahmaktum are you here yes because okay dope all right let's go with this one and see what's going on here hey guys welcome back to the great start i hope you are doing well so in this video i'm going to show you great you're getting to the point pretty quickly you how can you write python code into visual studio code great i already know what's happening here i'm not a fan of the title of the video to be honest python with vs code like that doesn't make that much sense to me i would probably do something along the lines of like um how to like visual studio code setup with python or like how to set up visual studio code using python something along the lines of something that's a lot more popular and people are already searching up and looking up when people have to read your title and go um what is that when you have to explain it to somebody it's red flag that's a danger anytime you have to explain something to somebody red flag so make sure it's something that immediately either yet or something is already popular when you made this title did you do the research of seeing what other titles like this are popular okay so that's what i would do and then i would uh then i would post up with that title python.org website i'm going is installed your energy is good you flow through it fast i like it check whether it is python and check it out go to vs code the vs code looks like this so you can save it as need of semicolon i think you have potential i can even see you have 16 to one dislike you're already over a thousand subscribers uh so it tells me you've probably been doing it for a minute i can see your energy and how you move with it so that's really really good i think just do more of this if you can invest in a better mic i don't know if you have a yeti if you can get something like a yeti go with that i think your thumbnails are really bad thumbnails i think you have to work on okay so i'll tell you the thumbnails that i think are actually good and uh so this one is okay uh this one is a little bit better um this one starts to get too much like i don't care about bai who and i don't care about learn with muktum so anything that makes it look like a flyer remove that that's an awful thumbnail um let's see most of the thumbnails they're really busy like you're you're putting a whole diagram on them so they're like too much there's too much going on hard to read model channels that are doing well make thumbnails like them that's the simplest way i can make it and it doesn't matter if you're in freaking india or sri lanka or canada or u.s it doesn't matter like this stuff to make things look good it doesn't cost you [ __ ] it's free just look at what the people who have the best channels just make it look like theirs then immediately it'll look good and it won't look cheesy and it won't look weird and it'll actually make people want to click on it okay also there's a free tool called canva.com yes and they there's uh there's a bunch of really good templates for youtube that's what i use for for the video that kazzy's about to roast me on nice all right cool so that's your roast let's go to frank hey everyone have you been wondering what git and github are i'm going to show you oh [ __ ] one tool for developers to use to collaborate with code all right our first step that's all you gave me get in github huh this is going to be going to github.com so open up your google chrome browser let's go right to it okay so something i want to tell you frank is i mean you you got it this channel is gonna go this channel is gonna grow okay something i would tell you um you're holding back emotionally okay i can see the fire in you and you kind of want to go but you're almost like holding back and being kind let that go and just be more like a little bit more on the voice so like i would i would just a little bit on the higher louder projection and i would just like go so like you're so close to it but it's like you know even the little bit like what is git and github like i would just go yo what is github yo this is your boy frank what is git and github you're like that even on the calls you know like you go crazy even on the calls on video when you go way overboard that's when you actually look normal it's really weird right so like even you guys paying attention to me on this call when i actually go overboard and i'm speaking really loud because that's not how i'm speaking when i'm with my girlfriend and we're just sitting eating like here's how i actually will speak with her right i'm like hey how's your day going though yeah so like this crazy thing happened the other day and you know we were on a call with these people on the zoom and it was such a cool call like i just loved it but you guys see how that doesn't actually sound normal to you guys on zoom it's like you guys lose energy and attention so i have to actually go way above and beyond on the call for it to actually sound normal so same thing on the youtube end i would push there's something holding you back i would push that way harder so then it actually sounds like really good and step is gonna be going to github.com i like that little like i like the design of the background the image that you have and then i like how what is getting github like how it's moving towards me so open up your google chrome browser let's go right to it it's built for developers you'll see this is like a very top tool everyone uses this to collaborate with code nice um you need to know this it's very important so let's click so here you're saying like you need to know this this is very important i just want you to do you need to know this this is very important i'd love for you to learn it and so that just a little bit louder there's something beautiful about it that it like hooks you there's something about it that when you listen you actually want to stay there just for a second longer so that energy is where i want you to play at because your video is already looking crispy clean click here on the sign up button nice i like how i don't know how you have a mouse that's bigger than [ __ ] my face but it's awesome a little test account let's see frank right like holy [ __ ] like this thing is [ __ ] huge uh dev uh let's pick something fun let's make a email address oh my god disposed something is with the sound there's a lot of hum in the background so i would focu i would reduce the gain to zero all right and let's let's make the password the same but make it 20 20. all right all right here we go are you sweating go email press preferences mega spicy chili's right okay holy [ __ ] dude let's verify that we're a real human let's pick the spiral i know um i know how it feels when you're making content and and yeah i've been through a lot of those sessions where i'm making content it just feels very contrived and like so sometimes just like loosen up a little bit before making it uh but you have to put your uh reps in so there's no way out of it so that's okay okay let's cut our profile here and here you see this is a repository called free code camp excellent repository see they have a bunch of different things here a bunch of different files it's a very large project here you see there's a lot of people watching the project that means dope so this is you know i love this you're gonna you're gonna improve so fast you're gonna get so good just keep putting it out and hitting public publish on it and then go and do another one another one this reminds me of like remember when i started my first videos and you can see that there's just something holding me back you know what i'm talking about right yeah i saw it um and so it's it's it's literally like that where it was something holding me back almost for a bunch of videos and then i started coming into my own and then i'm just like i'm just going this is what i want to teach and i'm going to go so keep making the these videos and keep making more and more of them so increase your quantity and just in a loving way i want you to focus on increasing your energy that you come in with like commit to coming in with your like entire energy see what i'm saying 100 100 i recorded this video at midnight and it's probably better to do it daytime so i could go real crazy yeah yeah yeah have the neighbors kill me yeah i mean yeah i love it though hey this is exactly like you're saying this is like exercise it's like practice you know i'm taking everything to heart i'm writing everything down what's up with that thumbnail though i took your your advice on the thumbnail oh let me see the thumbnail okay so let's go here i like the yellow oh [ __ ] i love the thumbnail nice job on it that's looking really really clean so great job on this the reason why i actually say to put your face on the right hand side sometimes is because this uh watermark actually blocks a lot of what's happening here so um it's it's like a actual problem like it's [ __ ] huge you don't see it right now because i'm on your video but like if i'm on my phone and it's in the recommended that watermark is huge there's like bunch of stuff that you could have there like for example the github logo is hidden so that github logo so that's why i would put the face here and then i would put the stuff on the left hand side that's one thing another thing is there's no need for a youtube logo in this so i would remove the youtube logo um the github the get in github logo is what i would have that pops a lot more so i would do this where okay i don't know if you could just try to follow me okay i'd move your face here i put the git and github logos like here and then i would put your text here kind of like that and no youtube and make sure the git and github logo have colors because they have such amazing colors that pop out you know that octocat or whatever it's it's really nice it pops so i would yeah i would put that there and that would be great but this is but other than that i mean it's a great thumbnail great thumbnail so nice job bro this is amazing all right guys everybody give it up for frank amazing job brother thanks guys nice mark is doing snaps i love it uh cool let's go on to who who should we take next we got oh we got lots of comments down below you can pick mark what who's mark is that did mark just say you could pick mark i don't know oh you said that oh all right i i totally okay okay i'm sorry i just got confused i need like a huge tv where i can ha i can see everybody nice savior what's going on brother all right cool dope bro i love your hair all right cool let's go to joey all right here we go joey joey my friend joe g music are you on this call right now joey hello going once going twice all right we'll move on to the next one uh let's go with red red diane yo what's up this is radion from top notch programmer and today i'm going to share with you an instagram dm bot so this bot is build it using python programming language and this bot can send messages to a list usernames on instagram you can use this bot for influencing for advertisement to get jobs or to increase your followers before watching this video please make sure to like and subscribe so we can break this youtube algorithm and we can share this video oh [ __ ] let's get right into it that's what i'm talking about bro that is a massive improvement you need to do is just to go to my github repository and clone we have to install holder uh let's extract here oh man i i want to talk about like the fury of the bangers i don't i never i haven't talked about it yet let's make and uh here and as you can see it log in successful and now we send this message to the first user okay cool uh make sure that random [ __ ] that you have in users text that that's clean so i don't know if these are the names of the users but make sure that there's not dumb [ __ ] in here because you're gonna get either downvoted or banned on youtube so just be careful about that okay so that's one thing i would just be careful about other i i just imagined probably was either a mistake or you were like scraping some username and somebody just had a random username and that's okay um what i would say for the rest of it intro is really really good okay so i love how this intro is and i want you guys to have intros like this too especially if you're showing people how to make something the best way to show that is just demonstrate it in the start yo what's up this is radion from top notch programmer and today i'm going to share with you an instagram dm bot so this one is build it using python programming language that's great so great intro on that um that i would be careful about like you're just like breathing into the mic you're not really talking okay let's extract here okay now is is extracted we can delete the zip file paste yeah so just i think like just overall flow of it i would make it a little bit faster so as long as you're speaking or you're giving some tips even in those small moments that's what makes a really big difference so there's very subtle things but they make a big difference so for example if you guys are watching my tutorials and i'm talking about moving this scrape bot or opening this folder i won't just be like and then clicking on this i i will actually be saying like all right guys so now we're gonna unzip the ig bot so i'm gonna go ahead and double click it and unzip it all right now it's unzipping it'll be unzipped in a second and as soon as that's done i'm going to move it over into the scrape bot and then as soon as the unzip happens i go all right now that that's over let's go ahead and put it into here so that part is really important to be able to have the flow of it going the entire time if you can keep the flow going it helps people get through everything okay so that's one thing i would improve here other than that great job radiant and big improvement from yesterday guys everybody give it up for red diane awesome brother love it love it love it okay let's go ahead for the next person and remember guys day five just want to share this with you guys day five of the challenge is tomorrow and what are we doing on day five of the challenge creating a blueprint yes you're creating yeah you're creating your very own blueprint for your own youtube channel all right so that's what we're gonna be doing and then day six i'm gonna have a surprise for you guys i shared with you guys a little bit about the launch of the course and that i can talk to you guys about it on day six and how it might even be possible for you guys to join so we're gonna talk about that more tomorrow at the end of tomorrow but right now i want to keep going through everybody's youtube channels so let's keep going through that all right so we got alex alexandros cool let's go i love it because you come to all of our you you would come to all of our youtube live streams so that was super awesome all right so let's see here are you there alexandros yes okay i'm here beautiful so um what i see here and you're a monk so i'm gonna be nice to you yeah it was a little draft effort so not so prepared okay that's fine you know but you know about what it's better then yes i know several improvements can be made so for example the sound can be improved yes no no no no that's not what i was saying i was saying it's even if even even though it's in draft it's better than 99 of the people who don't even have one video so you gotta congratulate yourself on the fact that you actually have a video okay so that's really really good so now let's go through it hello alexander's tuition friends and welcome to our cute python tutorial from pandas it's kind of ridiculous how much sound makes a difference when you watch this you're like there's so much wrong with this but if if he didn't change anything else and the only thing he changed is audio and just reduced his gain to zero put the mic really close to him and spoke that alone would make this video like completely watchable just that one thing alone like actually pay attention to sound right now right function based on slides by the instagram profile azure will so because of there's a lot of sound in the back if just that one thing improves almost everything improves so let's keep going now through this you can find the slides on this link i like how you have stuff prepared and organized alexandro so good job on that because you're respecting people's time i like that you have preparation behind it um this slide so so as you can see it says pandas shift function shifting grows there's kids in the back there's like all kinds of craziness so that's where this is the number one way to make your videos sound professional and something worth watching just audio i cannot emphasize enough invest in audio that automatically makes so many things better oh dude you are like you are actually providing valuable [ __ ] it reminds me of the garyvee tick tock where he told people he's like it's easy he's like open your camera and he's like just say valuable [ __ ] and people started making all these tick tocks where literally all they do when they open their cameras they just open the camera they go valuable [ __ ] so it reminded me of that tick tock and i was laughing but this is really valuable i think that if you just keep going you're gonna actually do well the only things for you um see if you can replace this with your actual face yes if you can't then maybe then just make the whole screen coding okay um other than that brother the only other advice i'll give you is keep going and make more you're making good content you're providing value people always want to go where they can get value from so improve your audio and then just make more content that's the best advice i got for you okay brother thank you very much you got it nice all right you got it take care uh yazid dark roast a bit of sugar uh kevin yeah yeah just a minute i'm uploading the video here just four minutes okay cool if you can go to the next all right all right got it got it got it all right xavier king let's go xavier's got his whole website up all right so kings oh okay i see it redirects me to it like that cool what yeah looks better than the garbly [ __ ] at the top youtube link yeah got it all right so okay so my first thing is what is happening i think i'm mostly confused so is this supposed to be like a lifestyle vlog or something uh not quite i am in the process of converting a school bus into a tiny house on wheels oh [ __ ] the process of the build okay and are there other people who do similar things yeah are there other people that are popular doing similar things um i believe still i know i've seen a bit where i was looking into it okay so so i see here watch this before you start a bus conversion i would literally i would just type in schooly and i would look at like what people are doing and what thumbnails are crushing it and that's what i would model the [ __ ] out of yeah so the number one thing is that you need to work on i cannot emphasize all your need your time and energy needs to go to like learning this and by learning this it literally means you type in one word and you take one thumbnail type of idea and one title and that's it you're good yeah so popular titles are really important that's really important i call them bangers all your channels need bangers you all need to [ __ ] make bangers if you don't make bangers your channels will never grow people are always like why are my channels not growing you don't have bangers so you gotta make bangers that's the only way you get found ever i have 490 videos on my youtube channel i have 830 000 plus subscribers on the clever programmer youtube channel there are only 10 videos that bring me all of those subscribers literally 10 videos that bring me 800 000 subscribers and then the other 400 whatever like they bring value and all that [ __ ] so you need things that help you get discovered a lot of you want to find out you guys want to find out right how you get discovered on youtube guys yes or no yeah if you want to find out how to get discovered on youtube you got to make bangers when we looked at alicia he dropped a banger on the 21st 21 day breakfast those types of titles are bangers if you can nail that video another one that's a banger was his how to monetize youtube channels in 2020 that's a banger title that'll work and it did and he got 12 000 views then he had one on birthday quarantine and that one did nothing because it's not a banger nobody's talking about that so until he has a huge subscriber base they're never gonna find out about that birthday quarantine video see what i'm saying so bangers is how you get discovered then all your other content is watched by people that you know discover you okay cool so that's why you guys gotta so number one thing is i would take something like this make a video on it um big titles whatever these big ones are schooly home conversion bus life touring lockdown what the hell these people do i would make a video similar to this all right let me go to your channel now all right schooly so now look at the comparison right schooly conversion part one and if you look here watch this before you start a bus conversion that's pretty cool one um seven regrets schooling home conversion so i would do something like this and i probably would not necessarily do part one also i think i wouldn't have this because nobody knows this or cares about this like for example if i'm about to watch this video i can understand everything and i even i can click on it if i'm about to watch your video i have no idea what i'm getting into because these are terms only you know and then this is something very specific to only you yeah i would actually recommend watching either the part 0 or part 7. i don't i think that this one's more of a time lapse of my trip to go get the bus cool i think what would be better is probably if you just made it all into one video okay um okay let's go to where part zero is hi my name is xavier king i'm 19 and i'm about to embark on a trip to buy i like that you're playing with storytelling i admire that that's really good putting emotional music playing with it in the start sometimes even when is caitlyn on here today caitlyn are you on no so even when caitlyn was on here yesterday right she tried a joke it didn't really work in the video that much but if she adds a little bit of music a little bit of this it will work so first it's important for her to take shots at it and then eventually she can actually make it work so same thing here i like that you're playing with storytelling there then there are times where you'll actually be really be able to make it hit home the bus i will be converting into a schoolie in fact there's a good chance this video will go live uh while i'm on my trip to el paso amazing look at the camera yeah okay having a little bit of an issue with that why is that uh i was recording it with my phone so i was trying to look at the screen and then the script that was right next to it and i never really looked at the camera that was right between them oh i see now how did i get to this point well first glance you'll see my dad gave me this idea back in february uh damn when i was looking for something to do most fun class i stuff we made association of turners a woodturning use autodesk january so i'm liking i'm liking your broll i'm liking all of that i think a few important things one look at the camera to mike i cannot emphasize mike enough mic is so important the same video will actually feel a lot better with the mic three you are reading too much off of a script to the point where it's making you a robot so i cannot connect with you as a human being if you read too much off of a script i want you to also speak to me a little bit okay that's a that's a important uh thing other than that i think for this is for everybody you all need to like actually pick banger titles and then like go all in on those videos those are how your channel is going to really really grow for clever programmer for my clever programmer channel i know my banger titles like the top five programming languages to learn um you know another one is like how to become a programmer in three months what are some other ones frankie that are like that always bang top four dying programming languages the crash courses that we put up they're always like they banged so so like there's a list of them and for you in your schooly you need to go and look at the schooly [ __ ] that's banging you can if you just keep getting unique with your um content and you don't actually look at what works you're never going to get found bro it's very unfortunate you're going to be 300 videos in with zero subscribers i've seen it happen to people they [ __ ] make 300 videos nothing ever gets found nobody ever knows them and it sucks so i want you to look at the top content then i want you to model the [ __ ] out of it model for you especially because you got a long way to go model it really closely that's how you're going to get really good you're going to pick up so much by emulating them yeah i was actually modeling when you search up schooly build because there's a lot of people who post the same type of things where they're doing the full build process and different stuff uh schooly build yeah um so which one is it where any of the different playlists there they go through all the different videos so okay so i'll click this one right here is that fine yeah yeah that looks like it's before but i was planning on doing some of those down too so like what's cool about this is they're telling me what is going to be happening when and what times yeah right so like you can do that if you added all that in your video and then you could give me that and then it would make it a banger video yes it would make it a banker video [ __ ] my life all right up into hers or your own thing you need to maximize your space inside of a butt has some little clothes storage this is where so surprisingly we actually live again and so we're just really looking forward to going west and seeing everything that it has to offer we love the snowboarding dope so this is a good video and he's showing us like what's happening throughout it all of it is packed in one video rather than part one two three four parts don't work that well on youtube people want that one video to just be selfcontained that's why when we would do these like eight hour live streams we wouldn't break it up into part one part two part three part four building facebook we would just have one video and you would just build facebook in there so i would recommend going that route okay all right we're gonna move on to the next one just because i wanna give more time to people yeah um awesome love it cool quasi harman says how did you set up your mic my current setup is yeti voice meter rtx voice okay cool yeah if you got that i think you should be good my just mine is uh i have a shure sm7b connected to a road caster pro and that's kind of it on my setup mark cinematic says i want a constructive rose please do i need to appear more human okay let's take a look yes that's a that's i didn't realize how inhuman i appeared until today yes it i mean it's one of it seems like one of those channels that you know have uh like like i know what these types of channels are like right like i'll go here and i'll click like i'll do trap instrumental uh stuff like that and i'll click it and then i'll go and watch and i'll watch some of these you know this one i like with the rick and morty one that's pretty sick oh my [ __ ] god all right all right all good just [ __ ] ads man god they just give me anxiety i would say bro for you let me let me hear this um i'm actually moving away from trap i didn't delete that video based off of yesterday you said don't delete anything so okay same okay cool don't delete anything yeah i love trap oh [ __ ] that's pretty cool that's sick i love that um okay so i think for these types of channels to really explode one of the hacks that i've seen is if you had a live stream that's just going permanently i've seen a lot of channels do that and they do really well with it that's one you know a service that offers that or would that be something i set up i have no idea about that i've never really looked into it uh you could you could call restream.io something like that no no no i mean that's not going to allow you to like he's looking to stream forever permanently like so yeah like lofi hiphop radio yeah re restream is just to be able to stream to multiple platforms so that's all that's all that is with restream you would literally i think need to dedicate one computer or one laptop to just streaming permanently okay um so you can have it like a cheaper computer that just permanently does that forever that could be what's up i'm sorry for interrupting but um with this infinite stream thing would that be like something i'd want to include other artists in to kind of grow my brand or would it be something i keep completely exclusive to myself um be careful be careful with copyrights that's a that's a big yeah so massive strikes on that right if you had your own music that you were streaming or things that are like copyright free you could stream that forever that could be one way to do it i mean honestly i would recommend you make videos with your face in it that are teaching people how to make beats how to make traps i think the problem with this stuff is there's no brand so like it's just music i i mean i can go to any channel and listen to music and so right that's your big problem then you just become a commodity like so that's why i would break that by offering more of a service i mean first of all you need to make youtube content where you're teaching you're giving valuable advice maybe you're teaching people how to make trap or you're teaching people how to make whatever this music is do you think an entertainment approach would work too like let's say i want to teach somebody how to make dubstep yes if you could if yes if you make that would be sick if you teach people how to make dubstep and then the video starts with you playing dumps dubstep i think that would be sick what is that guy's name andrew i'm just gonna type in andrew music i forget his name there we go andrew huang yeah he's all about music right but his videos are so freaking entertaining to watch like whatever he makes it on with att like this as you can see for each family member like hbo max all right boom there we go that's a great intro hey it's andrew huang and in today's video we're going to talk about what i think is the most powerful and most versatile soft synth ever faze plant from killerhearts full disclosure i am working with killerhearts i put out a preset pack with them and they also wanted to sponsor a video on my channel as you want pretty much as many as your cpu can handle just do a random variation of the parameter assignment all the possible places project tempo and the other two types of this yeah like if you're good at what you do and you want to go technical and you just want to go all in yeah like you're you'll crush but this is a good way to do it show what you're about to do it's entertaining and you can give value how do you feel about like trolling videos though like i want to pour mountain dew in old instruments and say that's how dubstep's made you know you could do that so like a lot he does that a lot where he uses like random sounds to make dub steps and music and stuff like that from it sweet make them entertaining like the best metric i can give you guys if you want to know if your video is entertaining or not so like for example let's say you picked out a banger title you already know what's going to be a good title video then the next step is sit there have your friends come in and see if you can watch it with them if you're sitting in that video and you want to just [ __ ] they want to shoot themselves like tell them be brutally honest like leave or stop it as soon as you're bored you're going to realize you're not even sitting through your video you know that's the that's the main thing so like if you can sit through your own video and watch it then that's a great video okay but you gotta enjoy it dope um okay cool so did that help mark yeah it really is tough just working with only music i need to grow out of that man yeah yeah and then yeah just add valuable advice to it and you'll be good you gotta add your face in it thank you my friend cesari asks uh tubebuddy or vid iq i do both vid iq until you need to buddy that's what i would say vidiq until you need tubebuddy vid iq is a great thing to use it's free to use with youtube it helps you with your seo and um other stuff i have tubebuddy to do advanced stuff like doing a b testing on my thumbnails so that's that gets more advanced but it's one day it's one thumbnail then the other is another thumbnail and then it picks whichever one the winner is and it makes that the thumbnail permanently what okay cool canva yes okay joey joe are you here i don't know if joey's here or not so i'm going to just skip past it again cool joy keeps posting but joey's not here oh he can't use the mic all right joey well let's take a look at this we won't have a lot of back and forth conversation but i guess i would say the same thing bro like maybe make some music where it's not just music add same thing i'm gonna end this very quickly because it's the same type of oh [ __ ] i didn't share my screen with you guys so here i would say the same thing is happening with joey uh that we had with mark you guys need to add your faces into it and you guys need to add your personalities into it and give valuable tips while entertaining so maybe entertaining the start and then give value on how you made that music or how you made that beat there's a big market for that okay dope awesome uh who else do we got uhhuh perfect oh i'm like really far adam says over nine years ago i did over 70 videos teaching english to native japanese speakers this is the last video i ever did for that channel can you give me a light roast please mostly focus on setup and presentation okay hey minazon how are you doing today holy [ __ ] mochironi genki da yo dude that's kind of cool yeah man good energy adam so happy bro hey that was nine years ago a different time and place [Laughter] yeah and like i said this was 70 videos in more than that i don't even know how many i did but um i i really appreciate everything you've been uh uh doing over these past four days because i think the reason that this particular channel never took off was that i didn't try to model anybody so i think all of my titles sucked um you know my thumbnails probably sucked but i think probably like you said my energy is okay i think my presentation is good so that's why i'm asking more to focus on that yep okay so uh important thing like the video qual i want the video quality not to look like wooden potato so that's important that's one thing i would try to improve because it's really hard to actually even like for example i can't even make this out at all what is there not that i even need to look there uh the text is extremely pixelated so it um it makes me not want to be in it and watch it your energy is the saving grace and i bet your content is good too so yeah i was a linguistic student at the time it was a lot more conversational in japanese i think it was pretty decent behind the teeth there let me see if i can nice zoom in a little bit more great energy dude like really light energy really like calm positive flows so i think that part is really good i think your speaking skills are really great too the biggest frustrations here just lack of pure quality outside of of course thumbnails and titles you can improve just the quality so the video at least should be 720p if not 1080p this video is 240p i have trouble visually seeing what's happening and i am it's really frustrating to hear what's happening if the audio quality could be better and the video quality would be better then this i think you have a lot of potential yeah like i said it was nine years ago there's i don't even know if they had 1080p back i know but even the last videos you sent me you're shooting in a vertical format on an iphone i don't know when you made those videos but they seem more recent yeah the past couple days right so i want you to use an actual camera or actual webcam because your videos i want them to be not vertical i want your videos to be 16 by nine so that's a good place to start because again you have good energy you have good thoughts i literally think if you just put a camera proper camera or even a webcam and good audio you can actually have like a good channel but if you don't 16x9 yeah just like a regular camera yeah 16x9 yeah um so all right dope that that that's all other than that adam like keep going keep making content just put it right there and you'll be good to go okay thank you i appreciate it yup you got it hi jen oh my god how are you doing it's good been busy this week wow you you look amazing your face is glowing you look happy you feel it feels like you're well rested um somewhat [Laughter] lack of sleep a mom of three teenage daughters can be rested i'm rested i think wow yeah that's amazing so i'm so glad to have you on here uh what are you currently are you trying to grow your own youtube channel what's going on i am starting a brand new one i have never had a youtube channel before nice to meet you at work all week i've been watching all the videos all day and catching up so beautiful here i am beautiful awesome well welcome to the channel uh welcome to creating your own channel and being on this journey i'm excited for you is there anything specifically that you have in mind i am probably gonna take what i've been doing um with the success coach live calls and turn it into smaller video snippets got it okay with my with my friends oh wow i love it i angry unicorn friends holy [ __ ] gets really angry amazing i'm really excited about that i think that's going to be awesome jen so that's cool that's a great way to go about it too because it's the easiest way to make content is just your conversations with other people that's a really good hack for making content just having conversations recording them like i believe exact for example even this gives me an idea about adam is how you're making your content jen i think if adam literally had zoom calls with somebody and he recorded them i think and that's great start for making content yeah it's a it's a really great way to get comfortable on camera is just talking to people like the last few months i spent tutoring and talking to people on zoom i've changed how i speak on cameras yes immensely i feel like you're so much more confident in speaking in your energy yeah that's amazing sorry i have really loud dogs and they keep barking that's okay that's okay yeah she um jen is one of the students in our profit with javascript course in clever programmer and she went in there and became a success coach and so she started doing a lot of like calls with people coaching calls oneonone calls and just by the repetition and practice of that like i me even knowing her i've seen her come a long way and i can see her confidence now you're happy being on camera in front of people big difference so congratulations i mean my first my first video i think ever was sent to you yes when i applied to be a success coach so wow amazing come amazing you've seen the full transformation i love it that is so amazing guys give it up for jen that's amazing all right we're gonna take on a few more channels and then go um go with them okay so let me see if you guys have dropped a channel that you guys want me to go through recipe says this was just for tasting purpose so i want medium roast i want to create a channel on coding so let's take a look at it i will share the screen um okay i would amazing fishing okay this is just like a test or something i guess of yours nice good intro um dude this channel is actually going to be good if you keep going music is too loud here so i would reduce it like when you're when you guys are speaking don't put the music so loud that's competing with your voice this is a good video like this is actually like one of those videos that like yeah so i would make more content this is good content the biggest thing is there's only one so i would make a lot more content and i would keep going i wouldn't like stop okay you're making good content you already i know you already watch a lot of vloggers you already got that vlogging style you got the music going you got the whole thing going received so that's what i would say to you make more and just keep going okay so awesome do you think it's still possible to use a funny video model to succeed on youtube yeah you can make funny videos that are like awesome and they work cool okay awesome yazid says dark roast videos 4k but need some time to process so maybe it's up now 23.5 million is the number of developers this year so why not be the next one in this video we will learn about the top five languages you can learn in 2021 anyway good intro very good intro 23.5 million is the number of developers this year nice so why not be the next one in this video you will learn about the top five languages you can learn in 2021 um audio is not coming from this mic so make sure the audio is coming from that mic right there um because your audio i think is coming from something else so that's what's weakening the punch punchiness of it the best language to learn in programming is not the best question to ask it depends like for every task for everything it offers value and class and those are frameworks for libraries that help you are for instant language obviously so the most important language the number one language you said it right in the start right you said your number one language is python right yeah that you can consider okay cool yeah right so i would do a few things one make sure i can see the python the text is too much at the bottom left i can barely see it so i would put the python logo or text up here and make sure you use logos because logos are very recognizable they're nice images so that i would use the other thing i would recommend is i wouldn't say the number one as the first one i would put it all the way at the end right if you're if you watch like the oscar awards you know they don't just tell you the best award as the first thing right they're not like and the oscar goes like the they don't just open it they're like the oscar goes too right they keep building up and building up and building up and marinating and marinating and marinating the finally what you're just like i want it please somebody tell me i need to know now so you're going crazy and then they're like right after this commercial break and you're like [ __ ] that's what you want to do with the video like this okay where it the numbers go backwards on this if it's top five number five goes first then number four then number three then number two so like it makes people wanna watch all the way till the number one make sense yeah make sense good job on popping these up those are for the data science developers although python has been for a while now but it makes so much sense to learn in 2021 it's a very good language infrastructure so yes great video improve the audio quality and i think you'll be golden uh in the back instead of having this stuff open random stuff i would put code just have some random code open so you look like you code um mic make sure the sound is coming from here and then you're just it's money and then just keep going and then whenever you can afford it invest in a good camera okay sure okay all right it's uh it's 4k but the only problem youtube has some problem with that it takes some time it's not only 360p oh i see yeah okay okay but one thing i want you to see at the end of the video there's a that's a good thing okay okay got it it's something i tried this time nice dope i liked um i would again the music gets loud yeah it's at the end i know i know but you're still speaking so it can be there but your voice needs to be clear over the like right now you're telling me to like and subscribe which is an important thing to say in your videos oh yeah but i cannot hear you right now the music needs to start going up and now it just goes maximum up okay so like how it works is right now it's a little lower it should be a little lower lower and then up all the way up here and then you leave them with that energy see what i'm saying yeah thanks so the endings just make them um let me see if we can do this give me one second here so all right so let's go here zoom so for example this is how i end mine right so it's like for example whatever video of mine you'll watch hi my name is ronald so let's take a look at like this one for example right how to get your first one i um bought a mac mini reynolds hold up one second random one second one second one second product this thumbnail actually looks fantastic so i'm just gonna show you on the outro how i key up the music so you'll see when i'm talking it's going to keep me talking and then the music is going to come in okay is it so watch this this is raphael quasi i love your beautiful face and i will see you in the next video and the reason for the music sound increasing so much and that like it hits hard and it doesn't stop me from what i'm saying okay so so raise it at the end you can model my videos you can take a look at like when i'll add in the music and like raise it up okay other than that great video great job thank you so much okay um dope let's take a look at the tool i used to draw on the screen is called screen brush uh that's the tool that's the tool uh yeah it's it's the best tool and pay for it because once you pay it allows you to do a lot of other like things stay on the screen the whole time and yeah it's totally worth it what's the id for that outro now that's a banger uh id for the outro what does that mean mark what do you mean what's id for that out like mark hello i can't hear you oh you wanted to know the name of the song or whatever okay okay got it so yeah the the name i i don't know what the name of that song is i forget but yeah we got it from epidemic sounds i should have it in my final cut pro so it should be in there maybe i can find it if you give me a second boom boom boom boom um so and then you know once you learn the skill you can do a lot with it right so like now we're starting to run ads you guys have seen my like youtube ads right you guys um seen that you guys saw the video that we made that's like right so all that stuff i'm it's happening right over here let me get rid of yoink so you want to start or grow your business with youtube i'm doing a five day youtube channel how many of you guys have seen this video every almost everybody i think should have seen this video just raise your hands or say yes if you have all right jen has cool so this is the video that was added in final cut pro this is where i edit all my like almost everything all of my secrets of how i went from zero to 831 000 subscribers on my clip so yeah you guys can you guys can really use whatever platform you guys want to edit i love editing on uh final cut my for my personal favorite platform to use and then i think the music that you're looking for let me see if i can find it uhhuh all right let's go here zoom and share my screen all right boom so now i'll be able to share with you guys what that one is so this one is called meg i think it's called magnetic eye yes hi you got it right thank you very much yeah that's that's the one it's a magnetic ion i think it's really worth guys learning how to edit your videos because you can tell stories there's something beautiful about being able to like tell your story the way that you want to tell it uh it makes everything hit home and makes it like you can have people go through an emotional journey you can make people feel sad you can share how happy you were and i think if you spend time learning how to edit i think it'll be like one of the most worth it skills that you actually learn and um let me see if any of these are the ones that have that intro oh yeah there's some some of these like really crazy but yeah like if you can make the intro something that's really exciting to watch and it hooks you then it makes people stay the entire time to watch the rest of your videos so definitely a skill that's very very worth learning and very very worth spending time on um you know this is why those videos are doing well like even when we saw alicia's video there's a reason why i was sitting at like 12 000 views or 600 000 views the the editing helps you can shoot just videos where you're just talking to the camera and that's good too but if you can edit and tell your story a certain way it just makes your video so damn good and rewatchable you know and again my test is can you bring your friends like can rocio can she bring her friends and can they watch the video if they can't sit through and watch the video it's not a good video so then you can edit it more and make it better if you want um can we do i knew that was your brotherinlaw i see his ads all the time oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's my brother yeah that's the one who i got him started on the youtube channel and everything but yeah now you guys will see his ads probably everywhere can we do a live video editing basics oh that could be cool i don't know if you guys would be into that but we could actually even maybe edit a video live uh yes no give me a thumbs up give me a thumbs down whatever it is that you if enough people want it you guys are excited about it probably could do it at some point okay a lot of you guys are saying yes i love it okay awesome so yeah we can do a live master class where i edit with you guys together and we can take a video and then edit it dope because i think there's a there's a lot of videos on youtube that show you the process but i think it's like you kind of take it to the next level how do you make it into like a banger i think that's what people were kind of talking about like yeah you know someone just walking slowly through you know final cut that's cool but how do you make into like something really good yes okay dope yeah that's uh you're right a lot of people don't actually show that you know and that's one of those things that's super [ __ ] important like even this one right this video the title is a banger title because i know how to get your first 1000 subscribers those that those that video will crush if it's good if i know that if i make this one video and it's good for my rafikaze channel three to six months from now this one video is gonna have me get 40 000 subscribers i'm not kidding just one video so if i can take this one video and spend a lot of time and energy behind it it's really really worth doing that really really worth doing that like for example i'll even show you like if i go to do we have our analytics open anywhere all right let me go to the youtube studio and let me show you guys something right let's go to some of the most popular videos so let's go here and then let's go filter by top five and see if it comes up it's right there cool so i want you to notice the this one yeah so there we go this one video let's go to its analytics guys look at this youtube paid me thousand dollars just to make this video this is just youtube paying me so think about that would you guys like for youtube to pay you 8198.48 49 cents for one youtube video yes or no right this is i'm not even talking about the fact that it got 103 000 subscribers probably it got me 30 000 people on the email list and when i asked to sell the product this video alone probably led to over 100 to 200 000 in cash this year would you guys be interested in knowing how one video can have you make either between eight thousand to a hundred thousand dollars is it a worth its skill to learn is it a worth its skill to spend your time energy and attention on oh yeah yeah no no yeah and if you if your cpm was higher you would be freaking oh billionaire oh my god yeah yeah yeah like you know if i was like oh you know i need to do this the problem is if i only did it for the money i wouldn't probably do it for long enough because i would my my love for it would run out but if i was one of those people who like enjoyed finance and i love teaching and if i taught finance holy [ __ ] it would be like the same exact video would be at 275 000 right now like literally this exact video because yeah yeah the video on my channel would like you know it's like i'm at half that revenue but i have like not even half that many views but i think it's in the health niche so it pays higher bro how much did that video how much did how much did you make off that video that you had 666 000 views it's like it's like 4 000 yeah you gotta [ __ ] go bro like you can make one video literally bro you can make how much are you making right now per month bro how much are you making right now i'm i'm barely scratching 100 now because that video started going down but i'm right at like a hundred no no no no i mean how much are you making your job right now per month oh oh making good money six figures okay cool so how like think about this if you could make one or two of those videos per month you would be making close to that same six figure income just from youtube ad revenue which is like i don't even look at youtube ad revenue it's like two it's usually i'm like i think of it as like nothing so i i mean i believe in your [ __ ] bro especially if you did something and it worked you gotta [ __ ] do more of that bro because just a few of those types of videos will just keep exploding you but so this is what i'm saying like the skill of making the videos is so worth it and it's so valuable youtube pays you and if you want to sell a course or build a brand you could do it you guys with me so far on this yes or no guys i i would love to appreciate a little bit higher energy okay i know we're all tired it's three hours or whatever we're in it's a [ __ ] saturday but we're a bunch of lunatics on this goddamn call right that's why we're here so let's [ __ ] go guys i'm going to ask you guys again do you guys want to learn this [ __ ] yes or no that's what i'm talking about guys that's the [ __ ] energy i want that smile i want that energy let's go hey let's go it gives me energy and i mean nobody's talking about youtube with this much energy out there so this is what's so freaking exciting and honestly what inspires me a lot is if we started our youtube channels and we're growing it together then the impact we're making together on the world is just absolutely insane and uh i just saw frank doing this but if you guys want to take a story at any point and tag at raf rafi.causeyrfeh.qazi that would be amazing i reply to every single person and i will repost all of your stories okay so this is one freaking video one video worth eight thousand one hundred and ninety eight dollars this is just one of them if i go back to the channel videos let's take a look at this other one this other one is worth how much let's take a look 12 dollars let's go lifetime this one is also worth 8 654. and got me 55 000 subscribers so think about this you guys two videos got me how many subscribers two videos how many 155 150 god damn 5 000 subscribers two videos two videos like if you can put your heart and soul and effort into it and you learn it two videos can get you that right and here's just on one more video and that's that eight thousand six hundred fifty four dollars so if you take those two videos it's sixteen thousand dollars that youtube paid me we got 155 000 subscribers we probably got 40 to 50 000 people on the email list and then when we were like hey we have these courses are you guys interested a whole bunch took us up on it and it provided them value and it exploded our business does that make sense guys yeah yeah yeah so this is the name of the game this is why i think this is so important to kind of understand why this [ __ ] is important and uh if i go share my screen again with you guys when i saw that i can make a video on how to get your first 1000 subscribers i wanted to make sure that i make that video bang so like it's gonna be actually good so the few important things i want to show you here that i'm doing is first of all i want to get to the point in the first one to three seconds that fast right when we saw alecio's video he got to the point really fast i'm going to get to the point really fast few other things i want to do i want to have framing that's hyper hyper relevant hyper relevant framing before i even say a word you already [ __ ] know this [ __ ] knows some [ __ ] right so you're gonna watch the sec second you know you're gonna watch like two seconds in and four seconds and seven seconds in so that's the hack this is why i even told a yazid put coding screen behind you makes like subconsciously it makes people stop so the framing is like perfect in that sense where there's a timeline you know that this guy's gonna talk about like this is not gonna be just some boring video where this dude is just gonna talk to me for 10 minutes about how to get your first down subscribers you're like i see a camera i see a tv with the timeline i see another computer i see this crazy thing okay something is about to happen what's about to happen and let's go how to get your first 1000 subscribers right i have a text come in with the key things that you're looking for how to get your first 1000 subscribers and the first two seconds with key framing so you if you're coming here to watch this video would you be hooked yes or no yes right you're gonna be hooked you're like okay cool let's talk about it guys so that is just to kind of get you into the video like now i've told you what's going to happen now i give you a little time lapse of me editing whatever you're like oh this [ __ ] is cool and then right before we start the video i give you now this is where i'm gonna build authority okay so this is where i'm gonna tell you why you should probably pay attention to what i have to say because you came in you've given me some of your time i want to be respectful of that and now i want to tell you like yo before you give me 16 more minutes i want to share with you what i have done so then i can respect more of your time you guys see what i'm saying my own youtube channel to over 830 000 subscribers called clever programmer and multiple videos with over millions of views and i cannot wait to share the secrets and insights with you guys that i've learned from growing my own coding youtube channel oh and by the right and then right before it starts this is a hack for you alicia i don't know if you do this but make sure at the right time get them to hit the like button the way right before we start if you could smash that like button that would mean the world to me good morning you guys today i'm starting right and then it just gets started um and then it gets going and then i take so i know this is going to be a banker title i want to make this now the best video ever because i know it's just going to be so freaking worth my time energy and effort just like for example you know i keep coming back to you alicia but even that youtube how to make uh how to monetize your youtube channel fast right that video you you know that's a banger title so when you actually put your energy into it it's totally worth it same thing with that 21 day thing that you did yeah i literally just like you said earlier i modeled videos that were already crushing it and said let me just do like an updated version of it that's the right way to do it bro it's the right way to do it um and then here i like was just learning so this is where i make it fun for me so then it doesn't just feel like a job so for me i like learning things i like uh getting inspired and i don't want to just do only the things i know so for example here i am now getting a lot more into sound design and i'm having fun with it so when i say sound design that's like adding audio that's like not supposed to be there that wasn't originally there you know so it's like the door opening or the cabinet opening so i have this little fun segment where i'm just taking a coffee break right and then i bring this coffee i sit down and i get back to the rest of the video so like for this video i am not worried about you know should i give this video my all or not like a video with the title like this i want to give it my all and go hard make sure that this video is good and then it's packed with value i'm giving you actually tangible advice you can use so this video is like phenomenal i think a lot of all of you guys should actually watch this on my youtube channel like mindset stuff is great there's this one part where my girlfriend is crying because her youtube channel isn't growing and i literally break down like look at this for the my first 10 months i [ __ ] got nothing like i made 41 in my first 10 months and almost no views and her channel is like doing nothing right here it was just getting one subscriber at a time so how do you actually deal with this type of stuff mentally and what do you need to prepare for so i try to pack that in in that video all those he's just shaking his head i like it oh my god that's so cute how many of them are there at least yo wow goodness too many man like one popped out i was like okay and two and three and then i think i lost count adorable oh wow adam everybody has kids popping out randomly just all happened at once i love it say hi hi let's see i'm not the only one here yeah yeah frankie pop out um hey uh yeah feel free to ignore this question if it's too off topic but i did want to know when you said that you quit like dropped everything your clients to go youtube fulltime did you save up like three to six months expenses or something or how did you get by in that um lean time when you had no income to the point where you were actually making some i um so what i because i was forced to make my youtube channel successful and make income from it i started coaching people oneonone the people that found me from youtube so like for example i was just like hey i'll charge you 35 an hour to teach you coding then i was like hey i'll charge you 50 an hour to teach you coding so i started making my living very quickly from my youtube channel so that's what i did adam until later i could figure out how to sell a course and stuff like that um oh wait i'm reading comments can you also do why don't you have merch i will have merch i already have a lot of like uh taglines that i want to have on my merch like for example in production we trust um another one would be like just one and then there are a few other ones that i would want to have in there so i would i would really love to have merch at some point cool i have no words when i see these stats yeah i mean they're really really like crazy like sometimes for me even for me they're hard to like believe like what is happening wow but you know it's just consistently putting that work over time believing in that thing and keep doing it and then those results just keep getting bigger and bigger every single time did you find that playing live shows helped grow your social yeah lives help grow my social media but most importantly lives make me come to life so for example this video isn't going to get that many views this video like right now the zoom call that we're on is not going to get any views i know that because the replay value of it is very little it's kind of like boring to watch a video of like other people on zoom so i understand that that's probably just gonna die at like two thousand views or one thousand views the reason for this is it feeds my soul to connect with everybody that's on this call ah it feeds my soul and i love it when i can actually speak to the people that are behind the camera you know that normally i just have to imagine all of you have to imagine a stacy and all you guys but it's so much it gives me life and heart and then this is the food for my soul and then it lets me go and then make more content for you guys and come up with ideas that are gonna actually help all of you because up until the zoom call i appreciate it kazi it's like you know coming from the pwj og crew yeah uh it's we we love having this oneonone i don't care if it dies on youtube right like yeah like be able to talk to everyone like all the brand new people learning how to grow youtube let's let's go hey that's beautiful bro thank you i appreciate it i appreciate that energy um yeah i love this man it's so it's really exciting and it um it doesn't become real for me until we can do this like until we can do this it's just the number now says 3.7 k members in the facebook group uh the number now says 195 comments you know so it's just like random numbers at best what i see even if i see comments just like avatar next to it but until i can start speaking with all of you guys and talking with all you guys that's when it becomes real and that's when it's really exciting for me personally uh rasib says could you please repeat from where you bring background music epidemic sounds robin says that is one reason why i clicked on your facebook ad for a five day clone class because you had super cool setup monitors desk equipment and lighting that's awesome robin talk to me about that hey hi no that's why i uh i don't even know why the facebook ad popped up in my feed i have no idea because i guess i've been um i had a project i had to do so i'd been googling a lot of different programming courses i had a program but not for many years and then one day that popped up and the only reason i clicked on it was because you had a setup like what i would want wow that's the only reason basically damn super cool wow so then i yeah so i joined the course and it's awesome that's amazing i love that because i i programmed like super long ago in the olden days and so i have no community whatsoever yeah because none of my friends are interested anymore they're all like doing other things so yeah awesome because this is what i want to do so now i have people to connect to great i love it and i'm going to ask you you said you want you're interested in programming so what like what made you join the youtube challenge and actually stay on this for the last few days uh well i have many ideas for youtube channels i did we did have a channel i've just built an online school and so we did have a channel but someone actually sort of they didn't steal it but they sort of hijacked it so i've stopped doing it and so now i want to get back on and i want to maybe do it for myself instead of doing it for a company so i'm just trying to get ideas and get inspiration and motivation i'm buying a mic i'm putting an order in tonight for mike yeah and um yeah damn okay that's amazing i'm excited for you and what uh are you getting a yeti or something different yeah i want to get a yeti okay cool i'm excited and you want to talk about coding on your channel no uh no i'm not an expert in coding got it um i used to be in c but that was ancient you know forever ago wow okay i have uh like someone's hired me or asked me to build and at some apps like in chinese medicine and doing um chinese medicine diagnosis and chinese astrology and doing health diagnosis from chinese astrology some like really sort of esoteric very super cool things that are very esoteric and i want to make it um uh like so so that anybody will be interested in it got it so take this esoteric language and make it attractive to people because it's super cool that no one knows about it yep so one thing i'll just share is if you're especially getting into territory where it's esoteric or there's very few of it happening uh the one thing i want you to also focus on and make sure see if you can find somebody you can model that is doing something similar somewhere and has success with it if you start off by modeling that that will give you a lot of room to grow really fast and then you can get really unique with it so that's one thing i would recommend because the one thing that scares me about like something that's very uh untested is you'll spend your time doing it but then nothing will come of it so i want you to get some results from it too because you're gonna spend time energy effort money right so i want you to go and model in areas where whatever maybe there's some other channel that's like teaching something esoteric or something like different model the way that they teach it in terms of like their titles and thumbnails and then content just make your you can make whatever content that speaks to you yeah cool okay thanks awesome thank you so much for coming on robin i appreciate you all right beautiful let's see do you guys have um so guys what i'm going to say is if there are any more youtube channels you guys want to drop we could do it but tomorrow we're going to be building your youtube blueprint okay we're going to be building and working on your roadmap so for today what i want to say to you guys is in terms of your guys's homework because every day i want to make sure there's some type of homework um again let me ask this again how many of you guys did you did the homework from yesterday where you made a video or worked on a video raise your hands raise your hands keep them raised keep them raised i see rocio did it aldo jen frank mark stacy miesha okay let's keep going and rediane okay beautiful awesome that's amazing thank you guys for the participation i love it let's do um what i'm gonna do is for the for the people who win the like in the five day challenge right we're gonna go through this and for people that i think have done the best and have grown the most within this time frame like even somebody the topnotch programming channel i forget who's it was redian i think and i even the improvement that he made was amazing so whoever wins guys i'm gonna actually give them i'm thinking to give them uh one live master class with me where i actually go through a full editing of full video okay so that's that's what i'm thinking about um also if you guys are participating don't think that you're too far off so even if you haven't maybe done some of the homeworks if you guys like participate and engage and actually are doing the things making the things it's possible for you to be able to get that okay so i just want to share that with you so if you're showing effort and you're actually putting in the work we can make that happen but i want to make that exclusive for a few people that are actually doing the [ __ ] work all right and i want to actually recognize the work cool awesome reynold i think you wanted to ask a question at some point and and it never happened you want to ask a question uh i didn't have a question right now but i appreciate everything you're doing this is incredibly awesome awesome thank you my man thank you i appreciate you being here awesome great all right guys well i hope that you guys had had a phenomenal session i hope that you guys freaking enjoyed this and got value out of it and you guys are inspired for tomorrow what i want you guys to do is i'm gonna i want you guys to start thinking about i want you guys to come in with a few things okay i want you guys to think about what your channel is going to be about and what product or service you actually want to sell so tonight i want your homework to be road mapping what your road to 1 million looks like okay again that's just a random number it could be wrote to your first 100 or 50 or a thousand dollars but i want you guys to actually write that down and plan that out okay so today that's what you're what you i want you guys to do for tonight write down what your path to that will look like so and you can actually i do have a question go for it who is that reynolds sorry it's ronald yeah go for it um so i had to like jump in and out of uh this like during the session so is there an easy way to find the link to the playback of this because it was kind of hard to find one location where you had uh so this is streaming to my clever programmer youtube channel that's one place you guys can find it it should also be streaming to the facebook group that you're in it'll also be there okay i'll check your channel because the facebook group had stuff scattered and it wasn't yeah i couldn't find yesterday's okay but i had i had save one and two got it so there is the channel and i linked it for you guys i mean not linked it but wrote the name so you can go there and it's in the most recent videos it's going to be on the channel and i know on facebook it gets scattered so hopefully we can get it there too so for homework guys plan out what that looks like so for example write down what you're gonna make number one what are you gonna make your content on what is your niche all right that's your thing number one so i'm gonna start writing this out so you guys can write this down with me and complete this so here we go all right day four homework okay and this is what this is gonna be step one write down your youtube channel niche all right what are you going to be making content on what are you going to be bringing value to people in so for example for me a lot of my content is going to be about people growing their youtube so how to get your first 1000 subscribers how to get 10 000 subscribers how much did youtube pay me to make a million dollars that stuff okay so have that what do you want to help people with you want to help them with coding do you want to help them in personal development you want to help them with music that's number one thing number two i want you guys to write down tonight in your homework is what are you gonna sell all right what is it that you're gonna sell is it gonna be a product is it gonna be a service um are you gonna sell your skill of coding you know like what is it that you're gonna sell for me it was a course that i decided to sell some people want to sell a coaching program some people want to you know please don't sell tshirts especially in the start it's the hardest way to make money um you can do that later when you're grown as a brand so i recommend the cheapest stuff go to that years later when you're bigger i recommend the start more expensive because you're only one person so then you can actually give more value and get also more income and then later when you can fulfill for mass volumes of people then offer cheaper stuff okay so figure out what your product or service or thing to sell is gonna be is the homework assignment clear for you guys is it clear yes or no yes frank says yes robin says yes yes okay great so when you guys come in tomorrow the first things i want to see in the chat is what your guys's niche is gonna be and what you're guys gonna be thinking about selling got it cool and then tomorrow guys we're gonna be talking about day five and then day five we're really just gonna get into it day five like if you guys enjoy day one day two day three and day four day five just will get a million times better because on day five this is now time where we're gonna start planning and mapping out your youtube content okay this is where we're gonna get specific with it we're gonna create a full blueprint and if you do this blueprint the right way you can have content ideas between three months to 12 months worth of content ideas okay so would you guys be excited if you came in tomorrow and left with a full on yearlong plus blueprint to your youtube channel yes let's go hey beautiful nice it's exciting i love it guys i again thank you so much for being here i know we've been going for so long i love it thank you guys for participating and giving that energy so that's
