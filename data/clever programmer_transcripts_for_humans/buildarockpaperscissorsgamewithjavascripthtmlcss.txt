04:18 - guys there's no restrictions on it
04:20 - whatsoever okay beautiful
04:22 - first things first we're going first
04:24 - things first we're going to do is create
04:26 - an index.html file that's of course
04:27 - that's usually the beginning that's why
04:29 - code does not seem too difficult that's
04:31 - right a beautiful so the first thing
04:34 - first we need to do is create an
04:35 - index.html so it's going to right click
04:37 - new file we'll say index.oh let's say
04:41 - uh new file we'll say
04:44 - index.html just like that all right
04:47 - i'm gonna place the music as we're
04:49 - cutting this up of course
04:50 - right and of course let's let's add the
04:52 - boilerplate and you guys know what is
04:53 - the way to add the boilerplate html
04:55 - anybody remember this
04:57 - anybody remember this
04:59 - what is a way to add boilerplate html
05:02 - yeah that's right so just not just tab
05:04 - but exclamation point right here
05:06 - dumb boom done okay
05:09 - done just said bulletproof html is
05:10 - already added by the way okay
05:12 - with this a little bit smaller
05:15 - beautiful all right
05:16 - bulletproof smell let's change the style
05:18 - to be rock paper scissors
05:22 - scissors
05:26 - rock paper scissors beautiful
05:29 - okay and of course now that we if we
05:31 - look at this page right of course
05:33 - there's a lot that's going on on this
05:34 - page that we need to do right it might
05:36 - seem complicated and actually it can be
05:38 - a little bit complicated if you don't
05:40 - know exactly how to divide a project up
05:41 - this into small little pieces guys all
05:43 - right trust me there can be some
05:45 - difficult parts so for us to make this
05:48 - easier i want you guys to tell me okay
05:52 - what would i do for example how would i
05:53 - develop this project what are the first
05:55 - steps and what is the second step let's
05:57 - go and look at this what's the first
05:59 - step we should do to maybe create a
06:01 - project like this anybody know here
06:02 - you're on youtube maybe you're on here
06:05 - what is the first thing we should do to
06:06 - create a project that's right shamar
06:07 - create a wrapper what is another thing
06:09 - we should do
06:10 - make divs yeah make divs that's right so
06:13 - let's think about number one is okay
06:16 - what kind of boxes is this dividing into
06:19 - right but before i even go into that
06:21 - guys sometimes i do this and i want you
06:22 - guys to follow along with me let's go
06:24 - ahead and create a new file and i say
06:25 - plan.md
06:27 - that's right planetmd and so for example
06:30 - i like to create a small plan so for
06:31 - example number one i'm gonna say you
06:33 - know what let's go and create the boxes
06:36 - create the boxes
06:37 - for how it looks like
06:41 - okay
06:42 - number two all right now of course let's
06:45 - figure out how do we make sure that
06:47 - how do we for example right number two
06:49 - let's go ahead and add create the header
06:53 - right that's that the header is gonna be
06:55 - which part the header is gonna be
06:58 - which part it's gonna be this part right
06:59 - here right that's the header right here
07:00 - okay so create the header portion
07:04 - oh the link to the project uh
07:06 - great
07:07 - right here isn't the project i give it
07:09 - to you guys
07:10 - boom the project okay
07:15 - so we've got the header okay after gen
07:17 - creating the header what else do we do
07:18 - guys tell me
07:20 - what is number three
07:21 - what else did we do what is number three
07:24 - anybody know
07:28 - well
07:28 - for me it's going to be to actually
07:30 - create the to that's right well the
07:32 - header is the banner the header is the
07:34 - better i'm going to say
07:35 - to create
07:38 - the rock paper scissors buttons
07:41 - paper and then
07:42 - scissor scissor buttons right so always
07:46 - like to divide these things up because i
07:48 - know that a lot of you guys right
07:51 - a lot of you guys i know
07:54 - a lot of you guys do not know somebody
07:56 - said what the link project what
07:59 - no the link cannot be from yesterday
08:01 - guys
08:02 - if you are in
08:04 - let me make sure it's all good
08:07 - no the link in the description is not
08:08 - from yes it's from today guys
08:11 - you guys are not correct on that one
08:13 - all right good no worries
08:17 - right number four is going to be the
08:20 - following right the one thing i want to
08:21 - think about is
08:24 - is
08:25 - okay well what happens when i click on
08:26 - on one of these buttons right how do we
08:28 - make a decision right how do we showcase
08:30 - who who won right remember and
08:32 - fundamental if we look at our wrapper
08:34 - game it kind of looks like this right we
08:36 - have you know uh basically when you go
08:38 - ahead and say i win
08:40 - or whatever might be of course it's
08:42 - going to showcase who wins as you can
08:45 - see on the inactual picture right
08:47 - so how do we do that
08:49 - that's right user interaction right so
08:50 - basically we just say
08:52 - create an on
08:55 - click event
08:56 - right
08:59 - create an on click event for the rock
09:01 - paper scissors
09:05 - paper scissors
09:07 - okay and then five five the last thing
09:10 - is going to be what after that after you
09:12 - create an unclick so we can have an
09:14 - event what should this event do what
09:16 - should happen when i click on something
09:18 - anybody know those who on zoom lamont
09:20 - david craig anybody what do you guys
09:23 - think
09:26 - right what is the answer that's right
09:27 - what is it who wins that's right right
09:29 - but what should actually happen well
09:32 - when clicking
09:34 - the button
09:35 - right
09:38 - we need to hide
09:42 - we need to hide right we need to hide
09:45 - one we need to hide this portion
09:49 - hide this portion right
09:51 - hide the buttons
09:54 - and show
09:55 - the actual winner
09:57 - right
09:58 - so to figure out a way to hide these
10:00 - things right because remember if i click
10:02 - on this you see it replaces it
10:05 - it replaces the actual content of that
10:07 - div you see so we need to be very
10:09 - careful around that
10:10 - okay great
10:12 - six
10:16 - six
10:17 - okay
10:18 - what now we've hit the buttons we showed
10:21 - this what now what do we need to figure
10:23 - out okay so we figured a way okay to
10:25 - maybe to we figured a way to go to this
10:28 - page okay
10:29 - [Music]
10:31 - go to this page what do we do after that
10:32 - to that page
10:35 - not necessary we want to focus on this
10:36 - just yet
10:37 - because remember there's one big thing
10:39 - we haven't done yet guys
10:42 - one more thing i've done that this one
10:43 - we showcased that's what we picked what
10:45 - about the house how do we know what the
10:47 - house picked
10:48 - how do you know what the house but you
10:49 - guys are going to we don't want to think
10:51 - about the score just yet no we're not
10:53 - clicking the score instead we're
10:55 - figuring out hey
10:56 - what is the computer going to pick now
11:00 - that's right that's right
11:02 - we need to figure out what is the
11:04 - computer going to pick
11:06 - so
11:08 - so figure out
11:10 - what the computer is going to pick
11:15 - it's going to pick that's right you see
11:17 - we're figuring out what the computer is
11:18 - going to pick that's part one that's the
11:19 - most important part guys
11:22 - right there's that's right it's a random
11:24 - loop so we're going to pick a random
11:26 - pick basically from that section okay
11:29 - so after we've picked that section
11:32 - okay after we after the computer so we
11:34 - pick this
11:36 - computer picks this what's next
11:38 - anybody know
11:40 - maybe david maybe sam
11:42 - anybody know
11:46 - well here's why i say to that
11:49 - that's right compare the results now you
11:50 - compare results
11:53 - and figure out
11:56 - who wins
11:58 - now awesome but of course we've done
12:01 - this the one thing we didn't account for
12:02 - is we create the header we create the
12:04 - operations game but we did not create
12:06 - the actual view for this
12:11 - we do not create the view for this guys
12:13 - that's the interesting portion right
12:15 - that's an interesting portion so
12:16 - actually after we create the right
12:18 - procedures buttons
12:19 - we need to create the view up for the
12:22 - contest i call it the contest
12:26 - the contest is this view because
12:28 - remember
12:29 - think of it like this this right here is
12:31 - a div
12:32 - it's a div okay it's a div
12:35 - and basically when i play again
12:37 - and this is also a div remember this is
12:39 - also a div right here
12:41 - but this div get this div right here
12:45 - this div right here
12:47 - oops no not this one
12:50 - this div right here gets replaced with
12:53 - which div anybody know
12:55 - this dude gets to play with what div
12:57 - anybody
12:58 - what is it
13:00 - anybody
13:01 - what would it be
13:03 - what do you guys think sam david
13:07 - jay
13:07 - you guys think what is this replaced
13:09 - with
13:11 - i'm winning you guys
13:14 - result that's right with the results
13:16 - right see this replace it now this this
13:18 - div right here replaces the other div
13:19 - you see what i mean so we're swapping
13:21 - the divs is what we're trying to do here
13:24 - right so if you think about it what
13:25 - we've done right now is we created a
13:27 - visual representation of how we want to
13:29 - create an application like this
13:32 - and for all you beginners
13:33 - all you beginners who have the hardest
13:35 - time of starting anything
13:36 - because i know you do i see this every
13:38 - single second i see this every single
13:40 - day
13:41 - oh i have the hardest time starting
13:42 - anything i can copy i can watch
13:44 - tutorials no problem but i can do not
13:47 - know how to actually create something
13:48 - you're not spreading your application
13:51 - into small little parts
13:54 - you see what i mean
13:55 - you think too big sometimes
13:58 - the thing is when we think too big when
14:00 - we think too broad
14:02 - we think too broad and we think that oh
14:04 - this project is so big
14:06 - then this project is undoable for us
14:09 - versus if you make a project and you're
14:12 - like you know what okay well i just have
14:13 - to do step by step you know little step
14:15 - by step
14:19 - that's right right you go okay we'll
14:22 - create the boxes create the header
14:23 - create the right resistance buttons
14:25 - create thank you for the contest create
14:27 - the on click events you know so that's
14:30 - pretty much it my friends
14:31 - you see
14:33 - now we have staffs we need to take does
14:35 - that make sense everybody yes or no can

14:48 - always gives me the power
14:50 - and let's go to minus html beautiful now
14:52 - image html a few things i want to do one
14:55 - uh before i actually go into the body i
14:57 - wanna uh do this i want to
15:00 - change the font style of this whole
15:02 - thing right so
15:04 - i wanna change the font style of this
15:06 - whole thing
15:08 - okay
15:09 - now
15:10 - to change the font style i'm actually
15:12 - using your font cold let me show you
15:14 - here
15:17 - here
15:19 - i'm using this font right here so this
15:21 - is called
15:23 - barlow something barlow so barlow font
15:26 - and the way you guys can get that is if
15:28 - you go to google fonts here
15:32 - google
15:34 - fonts
15:38 - okay
15:39 - and google fonts and then you just
15:41 - select the search up font called barlow
15:45 - okay i'm gonna say barlow right here
15:48 - you see if you just simply go to barlow
15:50 - okay
15:51 - and then you see we have weight of 600
15:55 - right here
15:56 - all you do is now say we have a weight
15:58 - of 600 you will select this barlow so
16:00 - select this style for example
16:02 - and by the way it tells you exactly what
16:04 - you need to do to actually use this
16:06 - simple as that so for example it tells
16:07 - me hey i need to use this so right here
16:09 - see so i select this 600
16:12 - and what does it do well i just
16:15 - copy this whole thing
16:16 - i'll place it in for you guys let's have
16:18 - it
16:20 - and i'll just paste it in for myself
16:25 - boom

22:25 - so div class i'm going to call it
22:26 - scoreboard
22:29 - okay so we're cleaning the specific divs
22:32 - and then within the scoreboard we have
22:33 - what a few things
22:35 - okay in the scoreboard we have what we
22:38 - have the
22:40 - um
22:41 - what is it what do you guys know the
22:43 - title so we have a few things right
22:44 - we've got this uh little title logo i
22:47 - call it
22:48 - okay this data title logo
22:53 - right here of course and we have the
22:55 - score
22:56 - so let's take a yeah that's right title
22:57 - and picture that's right
22:58 - so here here's what we have so number
23:00 - one is div class
23:05 - okay
23:06 - title
23:09 - okay deal quest title
23:12 - and then inside the title what are you
23:13 - gonna say well we're gonna actually link
23:14 - the the title image so those of you who
23:16 - guys again we have the
23:19 - all the assets down below in the
23:20 - description below you can either go to
23:23 - find a mentor we have the access below
23:24 - as well okay
23:26 - so from the actual whole project so if i
23:29 - do this if we go to
23:31 - assets right here
23:33 - here's all the projects all the assets
23:35 - you can just go ahead and click download
23:36 - the whole zip
23:38 - so what i will do is just simply because
23:39 - i already have it inside in here i am
23:42 - going to download it as a full zip
23:46 - so that i can actually get the assets
23:47 - myself
23:49 - let me see download zip
23:51 - hey beautiful let me go ahead and
23:53 - unarchive it
23:57 - beautiful
23:58 - nice i'm gonna take the assets and i'm
24:00 - gonna pull them up i'm gonna put them
24:02 - into my project
24:04 - what will just happen
24:07 - take them and put them all the way in my
24:08 - project right here
24:11 - add folder to workspace yes
24:14 - right here done see
24:16 - oh no i wanted to put it inside here
24:20 - that's right oh come on not inside the
24:22 - actual
24:24 - whoa
24:30 - okay i got a better idea let's create a
24:32 - new folder inside in that case let's
24:34 - call it assets because it's not pushed
24:35 - put in a whole folder for me and i'll
24:37 - just put the images like this
24:44 - right here okay that's much better right
24:45 - there see
24:47 - so i put the assets individually for
24:49 - here i don't need to do this in that
24:51 - case i need to i can just simply remove
24:53 - folder from workspace don't need that
24:55 - and right here so we have the assets
24:56 - folder in here you can just simply add
24:58 - it just the way i did it as well
25:01 - okay
25:02 - now let's go ahead and include our image
25:06 - right we'll say
25:07 - source is equal to what
25:10 - assets and we'll say what we'll say the
25:15 - title.png right there
25:18 - that way if i look at this right here
25:23 - let me go ahead and do this
25:28 - tell the png is not showing up
25:32 - am i doing something wrong anybody
25:37 - um
25:40 - let me see
25:42 - out of that png it's right here right
25:46 - spectacular
25:56 - it's really weird why that's the case
26:03 - i think the live server dropped that's
26:05 - why okay
26:06 - now open flight several more
26:08 - times okay there we go i think the live
26:11 - server dropped that's why it's okay
26:13 - all right so save that so we've got the
26:15 - title next one is gonna be the score
26:17 - card right so let's go ahead and create
26:18 - a score card that's gonna be inside the
26:21 - the
26:22 - scoreboard so day of class
26:24 - right that's gonna be what
26:26 - score
26:28 - boom right there
26:30 - inside that okay inside that is gonna be
26:33 - uh we're gonna create one a score
26:37 - like this
26:38 - and then the number of the score is
26:40 - going to be an h1
26:41 - like this
26:43 - that's gonna be for now it will always
26:45 - start with zero guys
26:47 - right
26:48 - what what dot is there a dot did i miss
26:50 - something what that
26:53 - sam what did i miss i think i got it
26:55 - right i think it should be good yeah it
26:56 - should be good i think
26:58 - right so h10 right there so now we've
27:01 - got this situation of course but it's
27:03 - not done now let's go ahead and actually
27:04 - modify now something the way i like to
27:05 - do it sometimes is let me show you a
27:07 - really cool trick here so if i right
27:08 - click right click and inspect i'm on
27:10 - this one
27:11 - okay here's a really cool trick
27:13 - sometimes i actually just like to do it
27:14 - myself
27:15 - right away inside inspect elements so i
27:17 - can see how the styles are changing
27:19 - really fast and this is a really cool
27:21 - tool that i like to use personally that
27:24 - you know just helps me out and make
27:25 - things css a lot better so for example
27:27 - if i go to the scoreboard here
27:30 - okay
27:31 - if i go to scoreboard here
27:33 - and
27:34 - i want to change it so for example first
27:36 - things first i'm going to give it a
27:37 - width so here so width
27:40 - oh 700 pixels
27:42 - to give a specific width
27:44 - after that i'm going to say
27:46 - border i'm going to give it a border
27:47 - actually you guys can see exactly what
27:48 - i'm working with one pixel
27:50 - solid
27:52 - solid
27:53 - and it's gonna be white why because if
27:55 - you look at it here right we have a
27:57 - solid white border around this whole
27:58 - thing makes sense
28:00 - beautiful after that we're going to do
28:02 - what well we'll say whatever it is to
28:04 - make it a curvature
28:06 - or the radius and how much do you guys
28:08 - want to give up whatever it is anybody
28:09 - know what do you guys think
28:11 - how much water is you guys want to do
28:13 - i want to say maybe 10 pixels 15 pixels
28:17 - i'm gonna say 15 pixels right here
28:18 - beautiful that looks good okay
28:20 - that looks great
28:22 - yeah sometimes at 2 em
28:24 - that works too
28:26 - 2 am all right then after that what's
28:29 - going to happen let's move it a little
28:30 - bit more up so let's do margin top
28:33 - if i want to push it from the top side
28:35 - what i guess you would i use guys if i
28:36 - want to push on the top side so margin
28:38 - top
28:40 - margin dash top is going to be equal to
28:42 - what
28:43 - 50 pixels
28:44 - that's right right so that's push it to
28:45 - the top
28:47 - don't worry about this whole thing don't
28:48 - worry about it that's going to happen
28:51 - okay
28:52 - don't know whether just just yet okay
28:55 - don't worry about it just yet all right
28:57 - yeah that's right 10 pixels 50 pixels
29:00 - after that what i want to do is let's
29:03 - also so we have a width let's also give
29:05 - it a height
29:07 - we get a height of 150 pixels
29:09 - okay
29:11 - beautiful
29:12 - right and then what we want to do guys
29:14 - you see how currently wrap up the
29:16 - scissors
29:17 - what does it look like well it's here
29:18 - then this is here we're going to put the
29:20 - score to the right hand side what do we
29:21 - do anybody know you guys know at this
29:23 - point right on zoom on youtube
29:26 - what do you guys think
29:28 - display what display flex my friends
29:30 - that's right so we'll do display flex
29:33 - yeah beautiful display flex okay and you
29:34 - can see it went from left to right now
29:37 - how do we push to use away from each
29:38 - other
29:40 - how do we push this away from each other
29:42 - so make sure it's all like this what do
29:43 - we guys use let anybody know
29:46 - anybody know well we're gonna use what
29:48 - justify content you guys can play it for
29:50 - me justify content what
29:53 - yeah space between that's right space
29:55 - between a beautiful okay that's exactly
29:57 - what i want to do it's exactly what i'm
29:59 - doing nice
30:00 - beautiful now the next thing for that is
30:02 - let's go ahead and go to our what um
30:06 - our this how to make sure this wrapper

35:14 - very simple sometimes i like to just
35:17 - test it out in my you know inspect
35:20 - element and then i will right away put
35:22 - it into my actual application so now
35:24 - check this out now all i have to do is

37:59 - harshal looks much better now okay
38:02 - sam your images should be working sammy
38:04 - just download the whole thing it was
38:06 - just
38:06 - if your image is not working it's
38:07 - because you put the assets folder in the
38:09 - right in the wrong folder sam
38:11 - you have to put the assets folder in the
38:13 - right folder
38:15 - okay
38:16 - okay so try it one more time there's no
38:18 - reason why your images should not be
38:20 - working my friend there's literally
38:22 - literally no reason whatsoever
38:25 - no reason
38:26 - period
38:27 - because
38:28 - it's a simple html application so if you
38:31 - have your index.html make sure your
38:32 - access folder are inside if you don't
38:34 - see your if you do this and you don't
38:36 - see access folder disappearing you did
38:38 - something wrong
38:40 - that's right there's something wrong
38:42 - right
38:43 - and if you go to for example your
38:45 - index.html
38:47 - right
38:48 - if you want to actually add that's this
38:49 - folder right look this right here means
38:51 - homepage
38:53 - that's where it means hey go to the
38:54 - homepage and then go the assets folder
38:56 - and as you're doing this you should
38:57 - actually have it so dash assets
39:00 - dash title png
39:02 - and of course make sure you have the
39:04 - live server
39:07 - move your images or change the folder
39:08 - name yeah that's right do not change the
39:10 - folder name do not move your images guys
39:12 - okay
39:13 - do not move your images
39:17 - there's a large code and will appear
39:21 - when i add to asset it is a large what
39:24 - somebody talking about sam
39:26 - no it should not be so if i have here
39:29 - let me show you guys
39:32 - here i have my app purposes game main
39:34 - which is downloaded okay and my access
39:36 - folder is here
39:38 - here's all my images
39:41 - take all these images
39:42 - and just drag them into right here just
39:46 - drag them that's all you have to do sam
39:50 - just drag them that's all you got to do
39:52 - my friend
39:56 - just drag them in okay you don't have to
39:57 - do much more than that okay just drag
39:59 - them in you can even go simply to your
40:01 - whole folder so if i just simply go to
40:02 - my projects folder
40:04 - right rock paper scissors here just drag
40:06 - the whole folder into here as well that
40:07 - will work as well
40:09 - okay that's it
40:11 - we want to make sure that you do
40:12 - continue with us
40:13 - okay beautiful
40:15 - so we've got the the h1 let's go back to
40:18 - my style the css
40:21 - go back to my style.css okay
40:28 - yeah good good thing retro that's right
40:30 - that's right yeah there's there's
40:31 - there's no you guys can get it if if sam
40:34 - if you can't get the images working i'm
40:35 - sure you can trust me i'm sure you can
40:38 - you just have to copy in the right
40:40 - direction that in the right way that's
40:42 - it
40:44 - i have my full i have a full confidence
40:46 - you can
40:47 - okay next one i want to focus on the
40:49 - score one this title right here score it
40:51 - says right here right so let's do that
40:52 - right now so i'm gonna say score
40:54 - score p tag
40:57 - done so right color
40:59 - color changes now
41:00 - the color is gonna be the 2a whatever
41:04 - this colors is called
41:06 - right let's give it a different font
41:08 - size
41:11 - font size of what font size of 16 pixels
41:17 - okay
41:18 - and then save that of course and then
41:20 - let's do a font weight of 600
41:26 - of 600
41:29 - okay
41:30 - and then let's do line height
41:34 - of 19 pixels just so it's a little bit
41:36 - higher right there beautiful
41:39 - okay
41:40 - and after that let's go ahead and give
41:42 - it a letter spacing
41:45 - of 2.5 pixels
41:48 - boom nice
41:50 - and then honestly that's let me see here
41:54 - um
41:55 - that's pretty much it the only thing i
41:57 - don't like is like i feel like this
41:58 - number is a little bit bigger this h1 i
42:00 - feel like it's a little bit bigger
42:03 - okay and that's pretty much it i think
42:05 - the reason why this is bigger right here
42:06 - is because i need to go to find a
42:08 - different font size
42:09 - sam did you get it by the way sam
42:14 - the color my friends is going to be
42:17 - the color right here
42:20 - sam just keep trying man you just keep
42:22 - trying you just keep trying make sure
42:24 - the folder your assets are on the right
42:27 - folder that's it
42:30 - what what do you mean about missing info
42:32 - what do you mean
42:33 - download
42:34 - go to the download
42:36 - it's here
42:37 - right here
42:38 - code
42:39 - download the zip
42:43 - here code download zip
42:45 - that's it
42:47 - code down the zip
42:49 - and then then your assets folder should
42:51 - be in there
42:54 - okay
42:57 - unzip it
43:00 - guys unzip it
43:03 - unzip it once you download it good and
43:05 - it should be right there there's no
43:06 - reason why
43:09 - yeah
43:10 - right here unzip it from here
43:12 - that's it and here's your assets folder
43:14 - guys
43:15 - okay
43:18 - got it got it yay okay cool you got it
43:20 - sweet nice
43:22 - yeah i just you know i don't like small
43:24 - things like these to just to for us
43:26 - i do not i do not like it when things
43:28 - like these like you prevent us you know
43:30 - from containing like small things like
43:32 - you know do not allow you guys to
43:33 - continue on
43:36 - so then font size or 56 pixels
43:39 - guys
43:41 - and of course that's pretty much it so
43:42 - if i do that save that hey let's go so
43:45 - here's our whole scoreboard that's it
43:47 - our scoreboard is done right so if i go
43:50 - to my plan right the header which is a
43:51 - scoreboard
43:54 - scoreboard is done i like to call it
43:56 - it's done so right let's go to the rock
43:59 - paper scissors buttons of course now we
44:02 - need to create this one this is going to
44:03 - be a little bit more difficult guys but
44:04 - that is okay the way i want to do is the
44:06 - following right if i go to my index so
44:08 - we have scoreboard what should we call
44:10 - the next section which is let me play
44:12 - this one this section what should we
44:14 - call this anybody think
44:16 - right what should we call this section
44:20 - what should we call this section well we
44:22 - i'm gonna call this section the uh main
44:24 - i'm gonna call it hands like which hand
44:26 - did i pick that i picked this hand this
44:28 - hand so i'm gonna call it actually hands
44:30 - guys okay
44:32 - i'm gonna call it hands okay so i'm
44:34 - gonna say say df class
44:36 - boom
44:38 - okay do class
44:40 - hands
44:43 - boom
44:44 - and then inside that is going to be very
44:46 - simple
44:48 - inside that is a few things we've got
44:50 - our left hand
44:54 - okay we've got this one
44:56 - this one of course and this one okay so
44:58 - let's do this right here we'll have
45:00 - the class is equal to what is equal to
45:04 - um
45:05 - paper so we're gonna have paper as a
45:07 - hand as well
45:09 - right then i'm gonna have which one
45:11 - div class
45:14 - okay i will start adding javascript in a
45:17 - little bit after we have the hands done
45:18 - okay
45:20 - div class
45:22 - scissors
45:23 - because like there's no reason to add
45:24 - javascript if the html is not done
45:27 - it's as simple as that guys
45:28 - okay there's no reason that javascript
45:30 - if the is not done then javascript is
45:32 - useless
45:33 - scissors
45:35 - and then we have div class
45:37 - dev class is equal to
45:40 - rock
45:41 - done gif class rock okay
45:44 - then i go to my uh and i'm going to add
45:46 - a few images one of course we got the
45:48 - left image right here
45:50 - got the left images okay
45:55 - why use html because graphic we use html
45:58 - because well pages are made from html
46:01 - this is not a react.js application it's
46:03 - a javascript html it has application
46:07 - okay so let's do this right now now
46:09 - let's do the image
46:12 - if you want to create html using
46:14 - javascript then be my friend
46:17 - go ahead okay then i'm gonna do
46:20 - the assets okay
46:22 - assets
46:23 - okay
46:24 - and then i'm gonna give it a
46:26 - that paper.png so first it's going to be
46:28 - paper.png the next image is going to be
46:29 - which one guys and there's next image so
46:31 - i image
46:33 - image source
46:35 - is equal to what
46:37 - acids
46:38 - oops like this
46:41 - okay
46:43 - assets
46:45 - and which one p uh what is this one this
46:48 - is the scissors one right so scissors
46:51 - boom and the last one is gonna be image
46:54 - source is equal to what
46:57 - assets and then i'm gonna give it what a
47:01 - and
47:02 - okay
47:03 - hand
47:04 - no actually no which one
47:07 - rock paper no rock that's the one
47:10 - rock that's right
47:12 - so we got these images okay let's see
47:14 - what actually how it works out
47:17 - okay let's see
47:21 - hey we've got it nice nice beautiful
47:23 - beautiful so
47:24 - okay with that with what we have so far
47:26 - of course
47:28 - okay
47:29 - we've got these images in here but of
47:30 - course they're not functional there's
47:31 - nothing going on here so let's go ahead
47:32 - and make them functional let's go to
47:35 - stylus css and the first thing i want to
47:37 - work on is actually going to be well
47:40 - it's hands right so the one thing i want
47:42 - to work on is the following so let's go
47:43 - ahead and do the hands
47:46 - boom oops that's not the one
47:48 - right well again we want to go where
47:50 - make sure these hands come from left to
47:52 - right like this right
47:54 - all these little hands go from here to
47:56 - here right
47:58 - the way i want to think about it like
47:59 - this
48:00 - i'm going to constrain my box
48:02 - no way i'm going to put my box like this
48:04 - i'm going to create this div right here
48:06 - and give it a session of width in a way
48:08 - where
48:09 - this will go here
48:11 - this will go here from left to right and
48:13 - then this
48:14 - is still going to go left to right but
48:16 - it's actually going to wrap and go to
48:17 - the next line
48:21 - it's going to wrap to the next line rosa
48:23 - asks why did i not add slashes
48:25 - good question
48:26 - don't have to add a slash here honestly
48:29 - because this slash means root folder
48:32 - that's what this means roots folder and
48:34 - um the inside html is actually already
48:36 - in the wood folder so that's why we did
48:38 - not add that slash in here i mean i can
48:40 - actually remove this it doesn't matter
48:41 - too much honestly but
48:43 - right sometimes i do it because to make
48:45 - sure it is for it it's gone from the
48:46 - roof because let's remember access is
48:49 - inside the root folder guys okay
48:52 - okay
48:53 - as inside the the root folder
48:56 - so let's do that hands and inside there
48:59 - uh a few things one is going to be what
49:01 - let's give it a specific width i'm going
49:03 - to say width
49:04 - is going to be
49:07 - it's going to be
49:09 - 476 pixels
49:12 - okay and then after that we're going to
49:14 - give it a height
49:17 - of 430 pixels
49:20 - boom
49:21 - okay
49:22 - so now it's again it's top to bottom but
49:24 - now the specific height and width that
49:25 - we are constraining it to right
49:27 - then i'm going to do this i'm going to
49:28 - take this up and say display flex
49:31 - flex
49:33 - okay
49:34 - see now it's from left to right great no
49:36 - problem
49:37 - now of course it's still not wrapping
49:39 - though like why is this still not
49:41 - wrapping let me see here for a second
49:42 - look at this if you look at our hands
49:46 - you see you see how we have we have
49:47 - constrained the actual box so it's
49:49 - smaller but this rock is actually
49:52 - outside the box as you can see if you
49:54 - guys can see that right there see it's
49:56 - outside the box
49:58 - not necessarily flex direction left
50:00 - retro not necessarily all we need to do
50:02 - is say this flex
50:05 - wrap
50:06 - wrap
50:08 - boom see right there just like that so
50:10 - it wrapped the next line right away
50:12 - you know if you constrain it
50:16 - actually magic it's going to look
50:17 - amazing and mobile actually so you're
50:19 - wrong on that one because if you're
50:20 - looking for the mentor
50:23 - it's going to look amazing as you can
50:24 - see
50:25 - yeah it's about how you design it you
50:27 - can always make out everything it may
50:28 - look amazing if you design it properly
50:30 - that's it
50:31 - so
50:32 - so then we're going to do justify
50:33 - content
50:37 - center to make sure it's all centered
50:38 - here eh you see now it's all beautifully
50:41 - centered i love it look we're already
50:44 - already already in a much much better
50:46 - position okay
50:48 - next up i want to give some margin to
50:50 - push this to the top right here so what
50:52 - am i going to use anybody
50:54 - anybody know
50:56 - what i'm going to use well i'm going to
50:57 - use the following let's say flex wrap
51:01 - no not flex
51:04 - who knows what am i going to use
51:08 - do i use what do you guys think margin
51:09 - top that's right so margin dash
51:12 - dash top
51:13 - like this
51:14 - our desktop and i'm gonna say what let's
51:16 - give it a about 100 pixels
51:20 - boom
51:21 - done okay so now it's that now of course
51:23 - now we've got this one thing you guys
51:25 - want to see is you see how we have this
51:27 - triangle thing right here you see this
51:28 - triangle
51:30 - triangle zoom zoom see this triangle
51:32 - well it's actually just an image
51:34 - that's right it's actually an image
51:36 - that's correct okay it's actually an
51:38 - image
51:39 - so if you took a look at it let's take a
51:41 - look at our image
51:44 - if i took a little image
51:46 - it's going to be the strangle so assets
51:48 - triangle.png this is the whole image
51:49 - right here
51:51 - boom right there you see
51:53 - so
51:54 - this is an interesting way how would you
51:55 - put this image
51:57 - behind these three little buttons
51:59 - anybody can anybody think of how you
52:01 - would do that
52:02 - just really curious
52:04 - can anybody think of how you would do
52:06 - that
52:13 - but this absolute no
52:14 - um
52:15 - yes osada background image okay
52:19 - background image that's right the
52:21 - easiest way is going to do background
52:22 - something for example i'm going to say
52:23 - background image here i'm going to put
52:25 - it here on the top
52:27 - i'm going to say background image
52:30 - url
52:31 - okay
52:32 - i'm gonna say assets
52:34 - right here
52:35 - and this one i'm gonna say triangle
52:39 - if you guys have the
52:41 - um the actual this page i'm you i'm
52:44 - saying i'm doing this if you're actually
52:46 - using i'm saying this right here right
52:48 - i don't need to do that anymore because
52:50 - my assets are directly inside i'm in all
52:54 - i'm inside the root folder right now
52:56 - you know
52:57 - currently you know here i'll be split
52:58 - this up into folders of css that's we
53:00 - have to do the dot dot slash to go back
53:02 - to the root folder you see that's how we
53:04 - did that
53:06 - but anyways
53:07 - just wanna make sure you guys are clear
53:09 - with that okay
53:12 - as i struggle the png let's see if i
53:13 - save this what's going to happen here
53:15 - oh yeah that's pretty crazy huh
53:18 - that's right retro now repeat so let's
53:19 - do back on repeat
53:22 - back on repeat
53:25 - back and repeat
53:27 - no repeat
53:28 - i save that so now it's in the left
53:30 - section what do we now need to do to put
53:32 - it in the center guys anybody know
53:36 - no not absolute
53:38 - yeah that's right back up position
53:40 - center so now i'm going to say
53:45 - background
53:48 - dash position
53:50 - center
53:52 - a look at that much much much better
53:55 - right much better guys okay
53:57 - now you see how there's more space in
53:58 - here than there is here
54:00 - what do we do with that one
54:03 - what do we do here anybody know
54:06 - what do you guys think
54:07 - well a few things we just add some
54:09 - margins so for example i'm going to go
54:10 - now to the
54:12 - um the nssg model you see how there's
54:14 - scissors
54:15 - i'm going to say okay so

55:27 - all right next one all right
55:29 - so next one is going to be well if you
55:31 - think about this okay i want to make it
55:33 - so that when i hover over this they have
55:35 - like this really small like feeling off
55:37 - you know of it's an actual button okay
55:40 - actual button
55:43 - what do you guys think we need to do
55:45 - to make it count like that
55:49 - what did you get something to do to make
55:51 - a cow like that
55:53 - yes hover but hover on what how do we
55:55 - set the hover you see right now we have
55:57 - all these different divs
56:00 - and it's a little bit weird honestly
56:02 - right
56:04 - well if i'm gonna do this check this out
56:06 - here's what how here's how i can do this
56:09 - and you have to be very careful to make
56:10 - sure it fully works so i'm gonna say
56:12 - the hands
56:14 - every single this oh that's not the one
56:18 - for this one i'm gonna give it a hand
56:20 - class because i want to target them all
56:22 - in the same way
56:26 - just like that okay
56:29 - uh the github link is here guys
56:32 - can somebody please paste the github
56:34 - link that'll be great you got you guys
56:35 - have it i think
56:37 - okay
56:38 - so if i do that
56:40 - and give it a hint that means if i go to
56:42 - my style of css
56:44 - i can say hands down hand
56:47 - yeah transform translate or fake that's
56:49 - right
56:50 - transform translate
56:51 - that hand
56:53 - okay i'm gonna say hey one i'm giving a
56:55 - cursor pointer
56:59 - okay because now you see how it is a
57:01 - pointer you see right there it's a point
57:03 - now and then what i'm going to do is on
57:04 - the hover of this hand so the hands
57:08 - on the hover of any hand again
57:10 - i think ahead
57:12 - i'm giving the same class because i want
57:14 - every single item to act the same
57:18 - that's i'm given the same class guys
57:20 - i wanted to act the same
57:22 - so that hand
57:24 - boom boom boom i'm gonna say transform
57:28 - and i'm gonna give it a translate it's
57:30 - called a translate so right here
57:33 - i'll show it to you guys right here it's
57:34 - called translate so transit 3d is going
57:36 - to basically translate the button
57:38 - this is gonna be x-axis this is y-axis
57:41 - so basically minus eight pixels is up
57:43 - eight pixels is what it's going to do
57:46 - so if i save this look at this if i
57:47 - hover
57:48 - hold on
57:50 - oh that hit hover i forgot about this
57:51 - one
57:53 - go point go point okay
57:55 - i'll do this one oh
57:58 - but of course it's jittery right we
58:00 - don't want that that's not a good user
58:02 - experience so what do we do we just add
58:03 - a small transition so we say transition
58:09 - 0.25 seconds
58:12 - done
58:13 - boom hey there we go and we my friends
58:16 - have created the transition that we
58:19 - need that is right that's right that's
58:21 - right that's right that's right
58:23 - beautiful that's all good that looks
58:26 - amazing now the question is of course
58:28 - what's next you've got the hands are
58:30 - complete
58:32 - all right there's no plan here doesn't
58:33 - everything look good next one is what we
58:35 - need to create the view for the what for
58:37 - the contest okay
58:39 - create the view for the contest
58:41 - now of course um a few things we can do
58:45 - i can actually go and quickly for the
58:47 - contest or we can work on this create
58:49 - the unclick click event just in case we
58:51 - can do some javascript how about that
58:52 - guys okay shall we do that
58:54 - let's maybe go and skip ahead a little
58:55 - bit and just pull into the javascript
58:57 - portion and then we can always do the
58:58 - contest here right after so let's just
59:00 - do that one
59:02 - that's right newton
59:03 - okay good
59:04 - so let's go ahead and do that so to
59:06 - create the javascript portion again um
59:08 - i'm actually going to follow along just
59:10 - the way i did it here with js
59:12 - so let's go ahead and do that
59:14 - let's create a new folder called
59:16 - js boom
59:19 - inside here i'm going to create a a
59:21 - javascript called index.js
59:25 - so i hear new file let's call index dot
59:28 - oh it's not creating it
59:30 - index.js guys beautiful all is good the
59:33 - well
59:34 - all right now
59:36 - okay let's think about this okay
59:38 - what do we want to do
59:40 - what do we want to do
59:42 - once we you know click on something what
59:46 - do we want to do
59:50 - what do you want to do
59:52 - what do you guys think
59:57 - what about zoom
59:58 - youtube chew that's right choose right
60:02 - you want to choose it right well um
60:05 - not in not a hr link and nature of link
60:07 - is about taking to the next page we're
60:09 - still on the same page we're not trying
60:10 - to any new page
60:12 - not necessarily joe
60:16 - we want to have
60:18 - we can add in event listener but i'm
60:19 - going to do a little bit differently
60:21 - i'm going to create a function called
60:23 - the pick user hand right so when i click
60:25 - on one of these buttons
60:27 - needs to call a function to actually
60:29 - pick for it right so to actually make
60:31 - some functionality happen so we can we
60:33 - can actually pick the next the computer
60:35 - can pick as well so you know so we can
60:37 - start playing this game right so
60:39 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna create a
60:40 - function i'm going to say const
60:44 - pick user hand
60:48 - and i'm going to pass in a hand here
60:52 - now you might be wondering what kind of
60:53 - a function is this not this is called
60:55 - the arrow function guys those are
60:56 - completely new it's called an arrow
60:59 - function and it's a new way to write
61:01 - functions inside es6 usually you would
61:04 - do this you'll say function
61:07 - function pick user hand right same thing
61:10 - guys this is the same thing as what this
61:12 - is right but no we're using error
61:14 - functions for now because that's the new
61:16 - the new kind of latest ingredients i
61:17 - guess you can say right
61:20 - something you said here link the js file
61:21 - that's right magic man that's good so we
61:23 - need to link the gs file as well so
61:25 - let's go to ins.html
61:27 - and everybody know how we link the html
61:29 - file or the script file
61:32 - so we'll say what script
61:35 - or you can even use a shorthand i call
61:37 - it script
61:38 - source right here see shorthand ammo
61:40 - variation enter enter and i'm going to
61:42 - say what js slash and is the gs
61:46 - done
61:47 - done
61:49 - that's right asada on click to the html
61:51 - element so now check this out
61:53 - right we have a function called pick
61:55 - user hand basically this is going to be
61:56 - cold whenever you pick something right
61:59 - let's go to our organization and what we
62:01 - can actually really do which is really
62:03 - really cool
62:04 - is on the click of of an image
62:08 - we can call a function
62:10 - on click look at this guys on click i'm
62:12 - going to call this function called
62:14 - pick
62:15 - user hand
62:19 - pick user hand just like this right here
62:22 - unclick pick user hand
62:25 - right unclick same thing with this one
62:27 - unclick
62:28 - pick user hand
62:30 - right also to a function
62:32 - same thing with this one unclick
62:35 - oh on click
62:39 - pick user hand as well
62:41 - right here and that's it my friends pick
62:43 - user hand so go ahead and save that
62:47 - that's right that's right that's right
62:50 - so pick the user hand but of course
62:53 - we need to tell this function what do we
62:55 - pick do we pick this this this we don't
62:57 - know otherwise otherwise just one key
62:59 - right so what we want to do is actually
63:01 - make it so we know exactly we picked so
63:03 - for example
63:04 - if i select something i'm going to say
63:06 - what
63:07 - for this one i'm going to say what do i
63:09 - pick here i'm going to put it into a
63:10 - quote here i'm going to get a parameter
63:12 - i'm going to say here what

63:41 - rock just like this so save that right
63:44 - and so let's take a look at how this

66:48 - example i'm going to i'm going to create
66:50 - a variable called let hands
66:52 - let's go to document
66:57 - that what query selector

67:09 - anybody know how do you hide an element
67:11 - anybody know
67:12 - so the hands by the way the hands how do

74:50 - what the actual following contest
74:52 - so one one first things first i'm going
74:54 - to give uh create a class
74:56 - i'm going to say
74:57 - um that contest because remember this is
74:59 - the the whole
75:01 - wrapper is called contest right here
75:04 - and for this dog contents contest will
75:06 - say well let's give it a width for now
75:07 - of 900 pixels
75:10 - okay
75:13 - 100 pixels okay why'd i do that because
75:16 - it's supposed to be a little bit bigger
75:17 - if you look for the mentor you can see
75:19 - that if i go ahead and just simply think
75:21 - is a little bit outside these boxes you
75:23 - see it's outside the boxes
75:25 - right here that's wow
75:28 - okay
75:30 - nice
75:30 - so with 100 pixels next up is we're
75:32 - going to say dot contest
75:36 - and the dog contest now of course guys
75:39 - what do you guys see on the contest
75:41 - section okay what do we need to do to
75:43 - make sure you know of course
75:47 - one it's a little bit weird right now
75:48 - because
75:50 - we don't have what
75:52 - there's one thing that we don't have
75:54 - right now it's top to bottom we need to
75:55 - make sure it goes from left to right
75:58 - what do we need to do anybody know
76:00 - why didn't you do anybody know
76:02 - well
76:04 - you display flex
76:07 - display flex
76:10 - hey that's right display flex sean
76:12 - that's correct right now
76:14 - here's an interesting one
76:16 - we display flex no problem whatsoever
76:19 - all right let's now maybe
76:21 - i want to change the images to be a
76:23 - little bit bigger so i'm going to say
76:24 - contest
76:26 - image
76:28 - i'm going to say this is what has a
76:30 - width of
76:31 - 275 pixels
76:34 - and a height of 275 pixels right here
76:38 - so now the images are a little bit
76:40 - bigger okay which i like a lot okay now
76:43 - what i want to do now okay
76:45 - is something very interesting how do i
76:47 - make sure
76:48 - that all these divs are in here they're
76:51 - equal width
76:53 - what do i do
76:54 - and we talked about the last time guys
76:56 - those who are new to those who you are
76:58 - what do we do
77:01 - we're talking about the last time
77:05 - not a line we're not going to going to
77:06 - align it no
77:09 - that's right grid may also work
77:14 - but it's actually going to be the
77:15 - following
77:17 - i'm going to give every single one of
77:18 - these now flex column i'm going to get
77:21 - every single one of these divs
77:24 - right here
77:25 - a flex one so what does this mean check
77:27 - this out if i do here dot contest
77:32 - i'm gonna give it a say div now what
77:34 - this means this right here means contact
77:37 - the divs right under so
77:39 - so that contest i'm i'm going to target
77:42 - just this div this div just and this dip
77:45 - right here because you see how there's
77:46 - diff inside this div if i do this
77:50 - without that then it will target all the
77:52 - divs
77:53 - this one and this one this one and this
77:55 - one to not target it i could do like
77:58 - this meaning hey target the the one
78:00 - that's the closest
78:02 - okay to the contest
78:05 - and now i'm gonna say flex
78:08 - one
78:10 - check this out
78:11 - you see what just happened all of a
78:13 - sudden
78:14 - we just changed that's right every
78:16 - single div is exactly the same width now
78:18 - it's weird the way it is right now but
78:20 - don't worry we'll figure this out
78:22 - okay flex one
78:24 - i'm going to add some margin to the
78:26 - contest i'm saying margin top
78:30 - top of what or 50 pixels
78:34 - just like this okay to add some space
78:35 - into it all right and then let's not
78:38 - target the h1 so i'm going to say that
78:39 - contest
78:42 - boom under h1 i'm going to say color
78:44 - white
78:47 - color white
78:49 - right so i want to change these titles
78:50 - right here to the color white i'm going
78:52 - to change the font size
78:57 - font size
78:59 - to be what to be 20 pixels
79:03 - nice so it's a little bit smaller okay
79:05 - i'm also given a margin top for this
79:07 - specific h1 let's say margin top here
79:12 - of 12 of 20 pixels as well
79:16 - and we'll give it a margin bottom
79:20 - of 50 pixels to push it away from
79:23 - these buttons right there let's see
79:25 - that's it much about 20 pixels beautiful
79:27 - and then i'm going to say this one and
79:28 - say text align center to put it in the
79:30 - center
79:32 - oh you see that's it right now i know
79:35 - it's not fully still centered but then
79:37 - don't worry about it we'll figure this
79:38 - out in a second here okay hopefully in a
79:40 - second
79:41 - the one thing i want to figure out now
79:42 - however is well uh the what
79:46 - what do you guys think
79:48 - a few things let's talk about the actual
79:52 - uh the
79:54 - you know this right here
79:56 - this right here
79:59 - so we have these and what you can see is
80:02 - you see this right here is centered
80:04 - so i just want to show you just how
80:05 - these work out so we have the contest
80:07 - and you can see how every single div is
80:09 - centered exactly not centered exactly
80:11 - but has the same width everything has
80:13 - the same width
80:15 - the left the center and the right why
80:18 - because flex one
80:20 - flex one says hey you know what
80:22 - this
80:22 - is saying hey
80:24 - the
80:25 - the importance of this div is the same
80:27 - as the importance of this div which is
80:29 - the same as the importance of this div
80:31 - that's what that means if one of these
80:33 - divs has the importance of flex 0.5 this
80:36 - step will be much smaller just let you
80:38 - guys know how that works out okay
80:40 - so we're given the same exact importance
80:42 - it's all about importance guys
80:44 - html likes importance
80:46 - likes to feel important
80:48 - that's right
80:49 - now let's look at these images you see
80:52 - hand image container what do you see
80:53 - right well it's you see that it's not
80:54 - standard actually correct how do we
80:57 - center this image inside this div who
80:59 - knows
81:00 - come on let me know guys ninten that's
81:02 - correct one fr one of our that's right
81:04 - grid may also work it's correct
81:07 - but zoom what do you guys think how do
81:09 - we center these image inside this div
81:11 - anybody know
81:15 - yeah
81:16 - that's right so display flags on this
81:17 - one right so if i do the simply display
81:19 - flex
81:21 - flex and i say align if i say justify
81:23 - content center
81:24 - boom see
81:26 - it just centered it just like that
81:28 - beautiful it's so easy not that's right
81:30 - that's it
81:31 - so
81:32 - to target this one
81:34 - inspect helmet you can see that what am
81:37 - i targeting here i'm targeting hand
81:38 - image container that's why i created the
81:41 - class because i want to be able to
81:42 - target this
81:44 - and this together
81:47 - all right so let's do that right now so
81:48 - we'll say dot contest
81:52 - dot hand
81:54 - um
81:55 - image container hopefully this works
81:57 - all right and i'm gonna say
81:59 - display flex
82:03 - beautiful
82:04 - and then justify content
82:10 - that's it
82:12 - that's it now it's centered perfectly
82:13 - okay next up let's work on this section
82:16 - right here
82:18 - right here this section right here
82:20 - this section right here okay one uh need
82:23 - to make this bigger two you need to
82:24 - center it in the center so it's all in
82:27 - here okay
82:28 - uh how do i do that well let's go down
82:30 - to downside that referee
82:36 - referee
82:38 - okay referee
82:39 - okay again how do we make sure guys you
82:42 - know there's the drill how do we center
82:43 - this you win and play again so let's see
82:46 - here
82:46 - you everybody know
82:49 - you guys know the drill the drill the
82:51 - drill the drill it's so simple the drill
82:54 - justify content and what
82:56 - and what justify content
82:59 - and what
83:00 - that's right we put that's correct you
83:02 - put into a column that's right sam so
83:03 - number one is put into a column so we'll
83:05 - say display flex
83:07 - right
83:09 - see
83:10 - and then i and i put into a column so
83:11 - i'm gonna say flex direction column
83:14 - it's a good catch on this one
83:17 - okay but man call remember just columns
83:20 - puts it from top to bottom but how do i
83:21 - center them sam
83:23 - or how do i send them uh le monde
83:26 - how do i center those
83:29 - that's right align items i'm going to
83:31 - say this
83:32 - one i'm gonna say align items
83:35 - center
83:37 - and just forgot you guys can see i'm
83:38 - reusing the same the concepts are the
83:41 - same guys
83:43 - the concepts are the same
83:46 - there's so much you can do with just
83:49 - a few if you know the most some of the
83:51 - most basic concepts
83:53 - that are really important in coding and
83:55 - look at this you win and this is
83:57 - so much better
83:59 - all right so much better okay now let's
84:01 - go ahead and change this you win so i'm
84:04 - going to say here
84:05 - dot referee
84:07 - h1
84:09 - i'm going to give a font size
84:14 - font size
84:16 - of 45 pixels
84:19 - beautiful
84:20 - that's correct asif and brian that's
84:22 - right
84:24 - okay
84:26 - okay
84:28 - and then after that uh well at this
84:31 - point i want to now focus on the actual
84:33 - new game button so let's do this one now
84:35 - okay
84:35 - so
84:36 - we got this play again button let's
84:38 - focus on this new game button right
84:41 - this new game button is just this it has
84:43 - new game okay so let's do like this
84:45 - we'll say that new game
84:48 - that new game
84:50 - like this
84:51 - beautiful
84:53 - all right
84:54 - first things first we need to give it a
84:55 - background color so let's say background
84:57 - color of what
84:59 - white
85:01 - that's it white right now it starts to
85:03 - white
85:04 - now
85:06 - one cool thing you can understand in
85:08 - order for us to create this into an
85:09 - actual button
85:11 - yes we can give it a width we can give
85:12 - the height
85:14 - one cool thing though here's what we can
85:16 - do and you can remember this for your
85:18 - whole life
85:19 - okay it's a really cool trick that i use
85:21 - all the time
85:22 - a button is not really about width and
85:24 - height it's not really about that
85:27 - a button
85:28 - is about a piece of text
85:32 - and then you
85:33 - telling that piece of text to have a
85:35 - specific padding
85:37 - and push the button out that's all you
85:41 - are doing my friends so if you want to
85:43 - create a button that surrounds a piece
85:45 - of text it's like you are taking for
85:47 - example you know
85:49 - let's just say this this little airpods
85:51 - i have here and you're right you're and
85:53 - you're saying hey you know what you know
85:55 - put space here i want you to put space
85:57 - here put space here put space here put
85:59 - space here and so now it becomes a much
86:01 - bigger square
86:03 - or circle whatever it might be
86:06 - okay
86:08 - so back on white after that i'm gonna
86:10 - say padding i'm gonna say give it a
86:12 - padding
86:13 - now the first this is a shortcut for you
86:15 - your first one could be top and bottom
86:17 - so i'm gonna give it 12 pixels this
86:19 - stands for top and bottom both top and
86:21 - bottom
86:22 - okay the second number stands for 24
86:25 - pixels
86:26 - that says for left and right guys
86:28 - so this stands for top and bottom
86:30 - left and right i can individually say
86:32 - top bottom left right i don't want to do
86:34 - that okay
86:36 - that's not for me
86:39 - so look you see it just simply expanded
86:41 - guys that's it it's simply just expand
86:43 - it okay
86:44 - next up let's go give it a border radius
86:48 - and that's going to be what six pixels
86:52 - okay
86:54 - six pixels nice job
86:57 - save that okay look at that starting
86:59 - liquid button
87:00 - let's give the cursor pointer
87:05 - nice let's go ahead and give it a
87:07 - transition
87:12 - transition off actually forget tradition
87:14 - for now
87:15 - do not want that
87:17 - um
87:18 - let's go and change the color for it
87:20 - here's the color guys this is an
87:21 - interesting color
87:22 - as the color looks a little like this
87:27 - boom
87:28 - this is the color
87:30 - i put a few guys in the zoom chat here
87:34 - [Music]
87:36 - boom that's the color guys all right
87:38 - everybody that is the color
87:43 - right here so the color is like this oh
87:45 - there see it's starting to look a lot a
87:47 - lot a lot better now let's make an
87:48 - interaction button so it's going to
87:49 - create a new game that hover so we'll do
87:51 - a new game
87:55 - hover i'll put create a hover section
87:57 - okay
87:59 - um after that we're gonna number one
88:01 - let's change up the background a little
88:03 - bit so background color
88:06 - here's sometimes what i like to do for
88:07 - example i like to like alica you know
88:08 - how it gives me some options like
88:10 - bisque beige let's just call it a bisque
88:13 - right now because if i hover this is
88:15 - like a very small difference you see
88:17 - very small difference
88:19 - and then i'm gonna say transform i'm
88:21 - going to actually transform it up so
88:22 - when i click when i hover over it it
88:24 - feels like there's a button there
88:26 - right there
88:28 - transform translate 3d minus two pixels
88:30 - boom
88:31 - boom now right there see
88:34 - but of course
88:35 - because we don't want to have it to be
88:37 - jittery what do we need to to do to make
88:39 - sure it's not that jittery guys
88:42 - what do we do anybody know what do we do
88:46 - what do you guys think what do you make
88:47 - sure that it's not it's not jet jittery
88:49 - so it's smooth
88:51 - what do you guys think on zoom le man
88:53 - yeah that's right transition oh sada
88:55 - that's right so i'm going to say
88:56 - transition here
89:00 - transition
89:02 - and that will be what transition on all
89:05 - zero point what
89:06 - 15
89:08 - seconds
89:11 - see that
89:13 - hey
89:14 - look at that so much better of course it
89:16 - does nothing for now but this is not
89:19 - where javascript comes in guys so we
89:20 - have the you know play again
89:22 - a beautiful my friends beautiful
89:26 - so look at that so guys look at this
89:28 - it's pretty much there if i refresh the
89:30 - whole thing of course this is here but
89:32 - don't worry about that
89:34 - if i click on it
89:37 - see
89:38 - so okay now let's think about like this
89:41 - now this is where the jealousy comes in
89:43 - we've got these two pages they are there
89:45 - no problem
89:46 - we need to think about how do we
89:47 - interact with it and show the right
89:50 - stuff
89:51 - well for one
89:53 - when we first start out
89:55 - okay
89:56 - this shows right now we have a where
89:58 - this shows let me go ahead and remove
90:00 - this
90:01 - this show is showing and this is showing
90:03 - which one do we actually need to show
90:05 - which only which one do we need to show
90:07 - which one the top one or the bottom one
90:09 - the top one in the show or on the bottom
90:11 - one
90:12 - now tell me which one way to hide the
90:14 - bottom one or the top one
90:17 - which i'm going to hide now
90:19 - the
90:20 - the which one the
90:23 - bottom one that's correct the bottom one
90:26 - so to hide the bottom one
90:28 - right if we go to stylus css it's the
90:30 - contest right you see use the display
90:32 - flex well let's change it to display
90:34 - none for now for now it's not for now
90:36 - it's unnecessary
90:38 - for now it's not necessary but you see
90:40 - it's just hidden no problem
90:42 - that's right
90:43 - now when we go back to instags
90:48 - check this out
90:49 - we're hiding the hands
90:51 - but we need to show
90:53 - the contest so what can we do with that
90:56 - now we need to hide this portion needs
90:58 - to hide
90:59 - which it is using this you see
91:02 - i'm going to show this portion
91:05 - so what do we do same thing
91:07 - let
91:09 - what
91:10 - let contest
91:14 - is equal to
91:16 - document
91:17 - dot query selector
91:20 - beautiful
91:21 - i will say dot contest
91:26 - dot contest
91:30 - right so we're going to grab the actual

91:44 - lamont
91:46 - craig what do you guys think
91:48 - sam
91:50 - how do we show the contest
91:54 - if here we have display none
91:57 - to hide it what can we use to show it
92:02 - necessary oh flex that's right so
92:04 - instead of displaying none i say display
92:06 - show well yeah it's kind of like show
92:07 - yeah so i say contest
92:11 - style
92:15 - dot

93:12 - um i'm going to say set the user
93:16 - pick
93:17 - i'm going to say the following let's say
93:18 - document
93:20 - dot
93:21 - get element now i need to actually grab
93:24 - this image it's hard for me to grab this
93:26 - image and there's no id so
93:28 - let me see command z i'm going to give
93:29 - this image an id
93:31 - and i will call it user pick image
93:34 - user pick
93:37 - image
93:38 - save it
93:40 - user pick image right here guys okay
93:43 - yes i just say gala element
93:49 - dot get element by id
93:51 - i'm going to say what is it user
93:55 - pick
93:56 - image
93:57 - and i will say what
93:59 - dot source
94:02 - is equal to what
94:08 - this is the interesting portion is equal
94:09 - to what
94:12 - is equal to what this might something be
94:15 - really complicated for you
94:26 - right remember we have this we know what
94:29 - we picked here
94:34 - is equal to what
94:37 - we're changing the source
94:39 - to the source that needs to actually be
94:40 - correct so if i clicked on this the hand
94:43 - the source needs to be paper or if i
94:45 - clicked on scissors the source needs to
94:46 - be scissors if i clicked on rock the
94:48 - source needs to be rock
94:50 - right there guys
94:54 - well not necessarily him because if i do
94:55 - this
94:57 - that's not going to do anything for me
94:58 - right so if i click on that it's just
95:00 - it's a weird image right
95:02 - so i'm changing the source guys remember
95:04 - see if i right click on this one i'm
95:05 - changing the source
95:09 - you see this one just became hand
95:11 - so this is what we need to think about
95:12 - this for a little bit here
95:16 - well how about this
95:19 - i'm going to say like this i'm going to
95:20 - say if
95:22 - if
95:24 - hand
95:25 - is equal to
95:27 - let's just say a rock
95:31 - i'm gonna
95:32 - take this
95:34 - right
95:35 - dot source and i'm gonna give the source
95:38 - of what
95:42 - or let's just say the source of what
95:45 - that's right
95:47 - oh good good that's a good one i saw
95:49 - that actually it's a good really good
95:50 - one that's a really good way of doing it
95:53 - you can say well it's right here it's
95:57 - assets assets slash what rock
96:01 - dot png
96:03 - right so let's try that
96:05 - i'll click rock
96:06 - see now it's rock guys you see now it's
96:09 - rock but of course i want to do the same
96:11 - thing for you know the scissors and
96:13 - everything else
96:15 - i can actually make this a little bit
96:16 - shorter for you
96:18 - check this out
96:20 - i'm going to create a dictionary object
96:23 - some of you might know might know that
96:24 - it is some you might not
96:26 - a dictionary object is a key value
96:28 - pairing it's like when you go to a
96:29 - dictionary and you open up the
96:31 - dictionary
96:32 - right
96:33 - inside the dictionary you have the word
96:36 - and then the definition for that word
96:39 - i'm going to have the same thing here
96:41 - i'm going to have a word
96:43 - and for that word instead of having
96:44 - definition i'm going to have the url
96:48 - to that specific word so all right
96:52 - let's do this i'm going to say const
96:55 - and options now this is something that's
96:58 - a little more advanced guys
97:01 - options i'm going to create a dictionary
97:03 - object okay again dictionary it's
97:05 - literally like a dictionary with a key
97:07 - value appear the key is the left hand
97:09 - side the value is the right hand side so
97:10 - for example
97:11 - i'm going to say a rock here this is my
97:13 - key
97:14 - this is my key
97:16 - the right hand side is going to be the
97:18 - url for that key so the url is going to
97:21 - be
97:22 - assets
97:24 - slash
97:25 - rock.png
97:28 - boom
97:29 - okay what is the next key that's right
97:31 - it's a data structure that's correct
97:32 - what is the next key this is why
97:34 - algorithms and the other searches are so
97:36 - important guys
97:37 - next key is what
97:41 - paper
97:43 - right paper
97:45 - so i'm going to say dash assets
97:48 - dash paper dot png
97:52 - boom dunzo
97:53 - and the last one somebody tell me is
97:55 - going to be which one
97:57 - somebody tell me in the zoom chat
98:03 - scissors that's correct scissors bomber
98:05 - that's correct
98:06 - come on let's write scissors so
98:08 - scissors
98:10 - again
98:11 - dictionary is an important data
98:12 - structure that you guys absolutely have
98:15 - to learn
98:17 - it's one of the most used ones that i
98:19 - personally use i've always used at work
98:22 - and it's something that yeah something
98:24 - we teach very much in the boot camp
98:27 - assets
98:29 - slash i'm gonna say what
98:31 - scissors
98:32 - dot png
98:36 - got it guys
98:37 - scissors dot png right there okay
98:42 - save that okay cool that looks all good
98:45 - no problem
98:46 - now how do we use this actually right
98:48 - it's just there but we don't use it
98:50 - we'll check this out
98:54 - i don't need this if anymore
98:57 - that's right it is kind of like json
98:59 - you're right it is kind of like json
99:01 - you're correcting that one
99:04 - that's why json can really be easily
99:06 - transformed into an object
99:09 - so
99:10 - instead of having source like this
99:12 - this out
99:14 - i'm going to use the hand options
99:17 - i'm going to say hand options
99:21 - i'm going to get the value using the key
99:25 - of the hand
99:26 - remember when i click on something this
99:28 - hand can either be a rock a paper or
99:30 - scissors right either one of these three
99:32 - values
99:33 - okay
99:36 - okay
99:37 - so whatever depending what it is
99:40 - if it's hand let's just say for this if
99:42 - it's a uh a rock if this value is rock
99:46 - it will go to hand options and it will
99:49 - find rock and give me this value that is
99:52 - what this does
99:54 - i'm accessing the actual object it's not
99:57 - 0 1 2 it's actually a key value pair
100:00 - david
100:02 - an array has indexes of 0 1 2. this is
100:06 - key values it works based on keys it's
100:08 - like when you take a key right you
100:10 - unlock your key with your uh to your
100:12 - door
100:14 - the key is the actual word in this case
100:16 - the hand is the key
100:18 - the value is what you unlock
100:21 - after you put the key in
100:23 - okay guys just so you guys understand
100:25 - the hand is the key this is the value
100:28 - you put this key in
100:30 - into the hand options let's just say
100:32 - it's rock
100:33 - it will give you the value
100:37 - it's kind of that's right bummer it's
100:38 - kind of like case statements you're
100:39 - writing this one it's a mapping
100:42 - that's right you call the value hassan
100:45 - by the key
100:48 - so here's the cool part because of this
100:52 - shortcut
100:53 - not only can i reuse this everywhere in
100:55 - my application
100:57 - but the shortcut allows me
101:00 - to just have one line to do everything
101:02 - that i need to do
101:05 - that's it so if i for example
101:07 - select this
101:08 - hey look at that see it picked it
101:11 - if i select this
101:13 - it picked it
101:14 - again if i select this it picked it
101:18 - right
101:21 - that's the cool part about this
101:23 - it just makes it so much easier for us
101:27 - whichever one you pick is gonna be the
101:28 - one
101:29 - that's it
101:31 - all right cool so we got that portion
101:34 - that's the pick right
101:35 - that was taken care of that's right it
101:38 - is it's very impressive it's very
101:39 - interesting for us just if you use data
101:41 - structure like this yeah it's javascript
101:43 - it's pretty cool and you guys haven't
101:44 - seen anything yet
101:46 - so now look
101:48 - we picked ours okay we picked our hand
101:50 - but how about let's use let's have the
101:52 - computer pick the hand
101:57 - um
101:59 - not asada sometimes but the thing is
102:01 - osada is like sada says hey can't you
102:03 - just use concentrate the path and go to
102:05 - the location you could in real life
102:07 - however the path might change the path
102:10 - might be different the path might look
102:11 - completely crazy so sometimes you cannot
102:14 - use the name so the you cannot sometimes
102:17 - it's better to have a mapping like this
102:19 - because you know later on you know what
102:21 - if i change this path
102:23 - to have to be different name you know
102:25 - and so if i use this dictionary i can
102:27 - only change it once okay i have to
102:29 - change it once and then everywhere else
102:30 - is still working
102:32 - okay
102:34 - oh you missed a lot retro you missed a
102:36 - lot
102:38 - don't go to the bathroom next time i'm
102:39 - just kidding go to the bathroom you have
102:40 - to
102:43 - all right so we've picked our hand now
102:46 - the next porsche is going to be well
102:48 - let's have the computer pick a hand so
102:49 - i'm going to create a function called
102:51 - pick computer hand
102:55 - it's actually not the heart
102:57 - pick computer
102:59 - computer hand
103:04 - okay pick computer hand
103:09 - that's right pick computer hand okay
103:11 - so let's go ahead and have the computer
103:13 - pick some kind of a hand as well okay
103:16 - so
103:17 - um let's do that well okay what are the
103:20 - options that the computer has what are
103:22 - the ops the computer has has rock paper
103:25 - scissors so let's create those options
103:26 - i'm going to say let
103:28 - hands
103:30 - is equal to what equal to either this
103:33 - i'm going to use an array this time
103:35 - that's right sam i'm going to use an
103:37 - array why you'll see why and there is a
103:39 - list of items so i'm going to say here
103:42 - rock
103:45 - then paper
103:47 - paper
103:48 - then
103:50 - scissors
103:52 - right so the computer can choose from
103:53 - any of these ones
103:56 - right
103:57 - the beer is going to choose from it
103:58 - that's right we're going to use and so
103:59 - we're going to use now
104:01 - is we're going to use a math.random
104:03 - because check this out right
104:05 - for example if i want to console log
104:08 - let's just say here i want to con i want
104:09 - to let's just say i want the computer to
104:11 - pick you know paper
104:14 - all i have to do is say this hands
104:18 - at the position of one
104:21 - this is position zero this is an address
104:23 - right well what this is is an address
104:25 - just like how like you have an address
104:27 - to your house everybody
104:30 - right an array has an address to its
104:33 - elements
104:34 - this is address zero this is address one
104:37 - this is address two
104:40 - that's right
104:42 - okay so for example let's go ahead and
104:44 - check this out right i'm gonna i'm going
104:47 - to call this function right now pick
104:49 - computer hand some say console.log
104:54 - pick computer hand
104:57 - no not because all the log i'm not
104:59 - actually called a function sorry
105:01 - take computer hand
105:04 - boom let's call the function
105:07 - okay let's call this function
105:10 - okay
105:11 - and i'm going to call this function and
105:13 - so now if i go right if i click on
105:14 - something like this let me see here
105:16 - inspect element on this one
105:18 - console you see i had the computer pick
105:20 - paper
105:22 - just the way i wanted to hands one is
105:24 - paper that's what i had to pick paper
105:28 - that's it guys you see so
105:31 - now now that we know that
105:34 - now that we know that
105:37 - okay
105:38 - all we can do is the following
105:43 - let me see here
105:45 - okay
105:47 - now that we know that let me see here
105:48 - for a second
105:51 - what i can do is kind of like this
105:54 - i can go ahead and you pick a random
105:57 - number what if i used math.random to
105:59 - pick a random number and have it pick
106:01 - rock paper scissors based on that
106:04 - okay
106:05 - so i'm going to say let
106:07 - cp hand that's the one it's going to
106:09 - pick is equal to
106:11 - hands remember we can say zero or one or
106:14 - two
106:15 - well what we can do instead of j of zero
106:17 - one and two let's have the computer pick
106:19 - a math.random what is math.random well
106:21 - it's kinda like this i'm gonna remove
106:22 - this
106:24 - i'm gonna say math.random
106:26 - just so you guys know it as well with me
106:30 - you see
106:32 - math.right now returns a
106:34 - number between zero and one so it can be
106:36 - 0.5 0.3 0.4 whatever
106:41 - well but you can make it any number so
106:44 - for example if i say math.random
106:50 - okay
106:52 - i'm actually going to multiply it
106:54 - by the length of these options because
106:56 - for example if if the if math.random
106:59 - says 0.5 0.5 times 3
107:02 - is what
107:05 - what is it 1.5 right 1.5 correct you see
107:09 - so depending on what on what it is so
107:11 - for example
107:12 - right let's say
107:15 - we're gonna multiply this by three
107:17 - let's say math.random picked
107:20 - 0.9 okay 0.9
107:25 - 0.9 0.9 times 3 what is 0.9
107:30 - times 3 is how much
107:34 - right there see 2.7
107:37 - just like that
107:38 - okay
107:40 - 2.7
107:42 - all right
107:44 - so
107:45 - that's what i'm going to do here
107:47 - now based on that what we can do is we
107:50 - can round the number correctly so
107:53 - right 2.7
107:55 - now is 2.7 closer to 3 or 2.7 closer to
107:58 - 2.
108:02 - is 2.7 close to three or two what do you
108:04 - guys think
108:08 - two three that's right so we need to
108:09 - some some find a way to round this right
108:11 - so for example let's go ahead and and
108:14 - round
108:15 - math
108:18 - math round
108:22 - what is the best run number
108:25 - that's right see so i can do math.round
108:27 - to round to the nearest number
108:31 - right so if i pass it a for example 5.95
108:34 - it will say six if i pass 5.5 i'll say
108:36 - six but if i pass this 5.05 it will say
108:38 - five
108:39 - so what we're gonna do we'll say
108:41 - math.round
108:43 - that's right math.round
108:48 - actually no we cannot do that actually
108:49 - we can do that because
108:51 - no that that should be um let's see 0.12
108:55 - 3 3 3 0 1 2. we can't really okay never
108:58 - mind so we can't really do math.round we
109:00 - have to do math.floor why let me show
109:02 - you why
109:05 - math.floor is gonna
109:07 - take it to the bottom so let me show you
109:09 - why
109:11 - because if we do math.round we can we
109:13 - can it will give us a three number three
109:15 - but the problem with that is this is
109:17 - zero this is one this is two remember
109:20 - computer
109:21 - goes from zero to two guys right
109:23 - go from zero to two
109:25 - right so we can't really do three we
109:28 - have to always go to the bottom one and
109:30 - math.floor what that does is the
109:32 - following
109:34 - math.floor
109:35 - math.floor i want to show you
109:38 - floor
109:39 - returns the largest integer less than or
109:41 - equal to a given number so for example
109:42 - if i do 5.95 it will always tell me 5.
109:45 - 5.05 is 5. so always say to the bottom
109:48 - number
109:49 - the closest whole number right to the
109:51 - bottom that's what floor does
109:53 - okay guys
109:54 - and so because of that
109:56 - if i if i get 2.73
110:00 - 0.73
110:01 - what am i gonna get what index am i
110:03 - going to use two or three anybody know
110:05 - two or three that's right obama two
110:07 - right so this will be scissors
110:09 - okay if let's say somehow i got 1.73 1.5
110:14 - what am i gonna what index am i going to
110:15 - use
110:16 - one what if i got 0.95
110:20 - what am i going to use
110:22 - zero that's correct you see
110:25 - that's right
110:27 - so that's how that's being picked guys
110:30 - okay
110:31 - and so all we did here is look math out
110:33 - random pick a random number multiply it
110:35 - by three and use mata floor to just you
110:39 - know
110:39 - i call it florida that's what i like to
110:41 - call i call florid
110:44 - right so now we've picked our hand guys
110:48 - and once we've picked our hand what can
110:49 - we do now well we've picked our hand
110:53 - let's actually change our hand
110:56 - on the right hand side right here
110:57 - whatever is inside here
110:59 - and just how i did it here i'm gonna
111:01 - copy this portion right here
111:03 - you see
111:05 - boom
111:07 - document
111:10 - dot get l by d user pick image source
111:13 - handout but of course we can't do user
111:15 - pick image no we cannot do that
111:19 - we can use what
111:21 - we need to create a new id for this one
111:23 - so this i'm going to say what computer
111:25 - pick image
111:26 - to change this was this one so it's like
111:28 - computer
111:31 - computer pick
111:33 - image
111:36 - let's copy this one
111:38 - save that computer pick image go to
111:40 - inside.js instead of this one i'm going
111:42 - to grab the one that's computer pick
111:44 - image
111:45 - and i'm going to change the source based
111:47 - on the options but not based on the hand
111:49 - but based on what anybody know not based
111:51 - on the hammer based on what
111:56 - this is b that's right somebody asked
111:58 - the question why do we multiply by 3
112:00 - because
112:01 - math.random gives us a value between 0
112:03 - and 1. and so we need to
112:06 - increase that ability so that if it's
112:08 - 0.5 it's actually 0.5 times 3 which is
112:10 - 1.5 you see what i mean so otherwise you
112:13 - know it's just going to be between 0 and
112:14 - 1 and so we're not gonna be able to get
112:16 - like scissors we need to be able to get
112:18 - to bigger numbers
112:20 - right that's always how we use it
112:23 - that's right cp hand
112:25 - and let me show you how this looks like
112:27 - guys let's let's take a look at here for
112:28 - example
112:30 - i'm gonna say console.log
112:33 - log
112:34 - log
112:35 - cp hand
112:37 - cp hand
112:40 - comma cp hand
112:42 - boom oops
112:51 - that's right magic man that's right
112:58 - to
113:00 - save that
113:02 - let's go back to our rocket procedures
113:04 - game okay now if i right click right
113:06 - click inspect them on this one
113:12 - let's click on it
113:14 - boom you see it picked scissors as well
113:16 - you see
113:18 - that's what i picked if i try again
113:22 - epic now rock
113:24 - so that's what it's doing it's picking
113:25 - specific ones right based on the random
113:28 - number
113:29 - based on a random number guys that's a
113:30 - really cool part so look we've got that
113:32 - now let's go ahead and actually return
113:34 - ours our uh what's it called our
113:36 - suggestion what do we pick so here i'm
113:38 - going to click return
113:41 - cp
113:42 - hand
113:45 - return cp hand
113:47 - now i'm going to attorney why because
113:49 - i'm actually going to capture here i'm
113:51 - going to say let cp hand here
113:55 - is equal to
113:56 - pick up your hand so basically i have
113:58 - the user hand which is here
114:00 - right i called the user hand
114:02 - and then i have the cp hand the computer
114:05 - hand right
114:07 - okay we've got that we've got that
114:09 - amazing but here's my question what now
114:11 - what do we do now well now we decide
114:14 - who's the winner and who's the loser
114:17 - cause let me say you you look like ill
114:18 - must thank you i do look like elon musk
114:20 - a lot of people have said that
114:23 - right
114:25 - so now we need to decide let's let's now
114:27 - go ahead and create the referee function
114:29 - say const
114:30 - referee
114:32 - const uh referee
114:36 - is equal to two
114:39 - two two two beautiful right
114:42 - so
114:43 - we're gonna pass in two parameters what
114:44 - parameters are we going to pass and
114:45 - anybody know what parameters are we
114:47 - going to pass in
114:49 - there's two ones and there are three i
114:51 - need to have the referee hand and then
114:53 - which hand do we need to have the which
114:54 - one the computer hand and the which one
114:57 - guys what do you guys think
115:02 - and the user hand that's right so i'm
115:03 - gonna say user hand here
115:06 - comma
115:07 - cp hand
115:10 - now this is just now a bunch of if and
115:12 - else statements guys
115:14 - just be patient now with me
115:17 - it's a bunch of if and l statement so
115:19 - for example guys
115:21 - okay
115:21 - if
115:23 - i know it's a little bit crazy if user
115:25 - hand
115:27 - is equal to
115:29 - right
115:30 - paper
115:32 - paper right
115:34 - and
115:36 - ncp hand
115:38 - is equal to what
115:40 - scissors
115:45 - scissors who wins
115:49 - right then who's the winner guys
115:51 - am i the winner or no
115:55 - am i the winner or no who's the winner
115:57 - the computer is doing right and
115:58 - technically i lose so we need to tell me
116:01 - that i lose so i'm going to create a
116:03 - function called set decision const
116:05 - set decision basically to tell me that i
116:07 - lost
116:10 - is equal to decision
116:15 - right
116:16 - and i'm going to console log my decision
116:19 - for now
116:21 - right so tell me i lost guys okay
116:24 - all right
116:25 - so now what is my decision am i going to
116:27 - say set decision here what am i going to
116:30 - say guys anybody know
116:32 - i'm going to say what
116:34 - you
116:35 - lose
116:36 - i'm a loser
116:38 - that's right i'm a loser
116:41 - okay that means i get no points i lose
116:44 - okay
116:44 - but what if
116:47 - else
116:48 - if
116:49 - what if
116:50 - my user hand
116:53 - my user hand
116:55 - is equal to for example
116:57 - paper
117:00 - and the cp hand and just so you guys
117:01 - know
117:02 - where this means and so both of these
117:05 - need to be true
117:06 - and the cp hand
117:10 - is equal to rock
117:14 - then who's the winner do i win or do i
117:16 - lose
117:19 - switch statement is a
117:21 - certain could work but the thing is
117:23 - because there's
117:24 - switch timing actually would not work
117:25 - sorry in this one
117:27 - switch that would not work that's why i
117:28 - win i'm the winner so now i say what
117:31 - sad decision
117:33 - you win
117:37 - you win just like this right
117:39 - now i win but i also need to increase
117:42 - the score so let's go ahead and create
117:44 - another function called set score
117:46 - const what
117:48 - set
117:49 - score
117:50 - is equal to
117:52 - here's the new score that we have
117:56 - right
117:57 - and consol log the score
117:59 - right let's set the score right so i can
118:01 - increase on my current score
118:04 - console.log
118:09 - [Music]
118:11 - that's right consider log
118:13 - score
118:15 - okay now how do i set the score if i'm
118:17 - going to set set
118:18 - score how am i going to set the score i
118:21 - want you guys to tell me i want you guys
118:23 - to give me your ideas
118:26 - what did you guys tell give me your
118:28 - ideas there's a few ways to do this okay
118:30 - a few ways to do this
118:34 - that's right score plus one well
118:36 - let's go and create actually a variable
118:39 - called let's score the one that's gonna
118:40 - keep track and it's gonna initiate from
118:42 - zero
118:44 - let's score
118:45 - initially it's zero and so when we do
118:47 - set score i'm going to say score
118:50 - plus one
118:51 - i'm going to increase that score below
118:53 - one and so now we have a new score that
118:54 - we can use everybody see that
118:57 - that's right ashika increase the count
118:58 - that's correct
119:00 - all right increase the count all right
119:02 - so we got that portion that's all good
119:05 - now guys
119:07 - i love it but what i'm going to do is
119:09 - i'm going to copy and paste i have all
119:11 - these if not statements for you here
119:14 - okay i'm going to copy and paste all of
119:17 - these ones for you right here
119:20 - if user hand cp hand right you guys can
119:23 - kind of and look at these ones these are
119:25 - all also inside the github guys go ahead
119:27 - and check it out by uh below okay
119:31 - check it out below those of you who are
119:33 - on uh zoom i'm gonna copy this for you
119:36 - as well and just paste it in for you
119:38 - come and see
119:41 - you guys can just copy and paste it okay
119:43 - because there's no point of me just
119:44 - writing all this out it's all about a
119:45 - bunch of decisions and you can see
119:47 - there's only a few ways that i win if i
119:49 - have the scissors and the sap hand i
119:51 - score plus one and if i have that rock
119:54 - and score plus one so it's kind of then
119:55 - otherwise it's a tie this really depends
119:57 - on what happens
120:00 - all right
120:02 - so guys what do we have here
120:05 - there's a three and a few ways only to
120:06 - win here just won't let you guys know
120:08 - that okay but at that point you have a
120:11 - referee
120:12 - a referee will set the score and will
120:14 - tell us what's who's the winner who's
120:16 - not so let's go ahead and actually do
120:18 - this
120:19 - okay
120:20 - hopefully you guys copy and paste it
120:22 - just copy and paste it guys that's it
120:23 - just copy this portion that's it you
120:26 - might not even need this else if you
120:27 - just then you can do you don't need to
120:29 - add this alphas if else if as well just
120:31 - remove the else that portion just to
120:33 - make it easier for you
120:36 - those you are on youtube yeah i can do
120:37 - it for you too
120:42 - here hopefully i'm not sure if i can
120:45 - actually no i cannot sorry i cannot put
120:47 - it in youtube guys sorry i have a limit
120:49 - of how many i have a limit to how many
120:51 - uh
120:52 - how many characters i can put into the
120:53 - comments
120:55 - so that i can't do it unfortunately but
120:57 - that's okay
120:58 - okay
120:59 - those are you on zoom did you guys get
121:01 - it give me can i give me can you give me
121:02 - a thumbs up you guys got that yes david
121:04 - got it thank you sweet beautiful
121:07 - all right
121:09 - if you're gonna go spin for draws that's
121:10 - right so now okay we've got that portion
121:13 - of course you have a decision so now the
121:15 - interesting is what happens when we set
121:16 - the decision to you win or you lose okay
121:19 - you win or you lose okay decision is you
121:22 - when you lose so if i do this
121:25 - okay
121:26 - great let me see if i inspect what do we
121:28 - say here
121:29 - console log
121:32 - refresh it
121:35 - doesn't do anything
121:37 - why do you think it's not doing anything
121:38 - because why because we're not actually
121:40 - calling this function guys
121:41 - we need to call this function so
121:43 - remember we have the referee
121:45 - we get rcp hand now we call the referee
121:47 - function and we say here the following
121:49 - we say referee
121:52 - okay
121:53 - we first we pass in our hand
121:56 - our option and then we pass in the
121:57 - computer option cp hand
121:59 - boom save that
122:01 - beautiful
122:03 - inspect element on this one
122:09 - and console
122:10 - and now
122:13 - i will say this
122:14 - you lose
122:15 - you see the house big you lose because
122:17 - why
122:18 - i picked scissors
122:20 - that's in the freshest one more time
122:23 - boom it's a tie right there that's it my
122:25 - friends that my friends is it okay then
122:28 - friends is it
122:30 - beautiful let me go on now go back the
122:32 - one thing we do see the score is not
122:35 - currently or setting correctly let me
122:37 - see here uh because i need to win
122:39 - actually
122:41 - okay great so we got that portion let's
122:42 - go ahead and do this for decision we
122:45 - need to change this to you win or you
122:47 - lose depending on the decision it is
122:48 - okay
122:51 - okay here you guys want the github yeah
122:56 - here's the github guys for those of you
122:58 - who are on youtube
123:00 - this is the full code guys those are on
123:01 - youtube here's the full code okay you
123:03 - guys can use it
123:04 - all right
123:08 - let's set the decision remember decision
123:10 - is where is that where is inside here
123:13 - to change that all i have to do is do
123:14 - document
123:16 - that what the query selector
123:18 - right class
123:20 - like this
123:23 - dot decision
123:26 - and i'm going to say dot what the inner
123:29 - actually that decision h1 right
123:32 - the inner text
123:36 - text
123:38 - is equal to what is equal to decision
123:41 - that's right
123:43 - that's it so now for example you see i'm
123:45 - going to replace the text with a
123:47 - decision that i passed in either you win
123:49 - or you lose that's what's going on
123:52 - and so let's try that right now save it
123:55 - you lose makes sense let's refresh it
123:57 - one more time
123:59 - okay
124:01 - it's a tie beautiful
124:03 - one more time
124:05 - a it's a oh damn again holy moly come on
124:10 - oh i want to win come on
124:12 - give me winning one and i win right just
124:14 - like that okay beautiful so that's
124:16 - already working guys we're almost done
124:18 - so close guys so so so so close next one
124:22 - same thing with the score remember guys
124:23 - we need to set the new score same thing
124:26 - if you go to any html the score is where
124:28 - the score is here and we can change that
124:32 - so we do dot score
124:34 - so document
124:37 - the query selector
124:40 - selector we say
124:42 - dot
124:43 - score right
124:45 - and we need to modify the text within
124:47 - the h1 so that score i'm going to say h1
124:50 - as well correct
124:52 - and i will say dot inner text
124:57 - is equal to what
124:58 - score
124:59 - that's it
125:01 - so now
125:02 - ready let me do this
125:04 - you lose okay so there's no score again
125:06 - so refresh this
125:08 - two you lose oh dang i keep losing every
125:10 - time
125:12 - boom you oh come on
125:13 - give me something
125:15 - you win and look the score increased by
125:17 - one
125:19 - just like that guys
125:21 - just like that it's already working
125:24 - guys at this point everything is almost
125:26 - done there's one last thing finished
125:29 - last thing that we need to do which is
125:31 - what this play again button we need to
125:34 - make sure that we can play again
125:39 - after i added the above i got them wait
125:43 - your file couldn't be accessed
125:45 - may have been moved edited or deleted um
125:48 - i don't think so i want to make sure you
125:50 - have the whole function my friend so
125:52 - here
125:53 - sam copy this whole function the referee
125:55 - function and just replace yours
125:59 - here
126:01 - right here there's the whole referee
126:03 - function copy and paste it okay
126:05 - that's it my friend
126:09 - okay cool so save that beautiful
126:12 - now one last thing is play again button
126:13 - so again with this one we're to create a
126:15 - function called play again so let me do
126:17 - that right now it's going to be called
126:19 - restart game so let's go and create a
126:21 - function
126:22 - const
126:24 - restart
126:26 - almost done guys almost done
126:29 - beautiful
126:32 - nice okay i'm liking this okay and then
126:36 - what do we need to do to restart the
126:37 - game remember
126:38 - to initialize the game when we do this
126:41 - we hide this box
126:43 - this box
126:44 - and we show
126:46 - this new box
126:47 - but just to go back to the page what do
126:50 - we do now what do we do guys who knows
126:52 - we do what we
126:54 - that's right hide and flex it hide and
126:56 - flex it i didn't flex this now we
126:58 - reverse the psychology now now we say
127:00 - the following we go back to our see this
127:02 - contest right here where we display none
127:04 - i'm actually going to copy these ones
127:06 - right here
127:08 - coming from pick user hand
127:10 - paste it into here and i'm going to
127:11 - reverse them
127:13 - so now
127:14 - the hand is actually what display what
127:16 - flex
127:17 - versus the contest which is this one is
127:20 - display what
127:22 - none
127:24 - so look
127:25 - okay
127:26 - but of course it's not going to work
127:27 - because we need to uh
127:31 - we need to actually call this function
127:33 - so let's call this
127:34 - on the click of the play game function
127:37 - let's do this on
127:38 - click on click
127:42 - i'm called restart
127:45 - uh
127:45 - game
127:47 - right there save
127:49 - beautiful all right we restart the game
127:52 - all right my friends let's try this out
127:54 - okay
127:58 - first out
127:59 - boom all right you win
128:01 - score added
128:03 - play again
128:04 - hey
128:05 - another one
128:06 - you win but hold on score was not added
128:08 - hold on it's a tie you lose
128:11 - you lose
128:12 - you win why is this score not added it
128:14 - just does not keep edit that's
128:16 - interesting let's score the inner one
128:24 - does not increase more than one for some
128:26 - reason why is that the case
128:28 - i'm really curious
128:34 - the restart game my friends was put
128:37 - inside here
128:39 - you see this day of class new game i put
128:42 - an on click on this restart game so it's
128:45 - looking like it's working
128:47 - but
128:48 - hold on it's a tie
128:51 - okay you win plus one
128:53 - you want but
128:54 - it's not increasing anymore plus one why
128:56 - is that the case hmm
128:59 - that's interesting
129:01 - why is that the case they're so close
129:03 - i'm so close
129:05 - score zero oh
129:07 - i know because i need to actually set
129:09 - the score so i said to say the new score
129:12 - is equal to
129:14 - score
129:16 - remember we're adding one here but we're
129:18 - not actually saving that the new score
129:20 - right i'm adding one as a parameter
129:22 - which is being added here but i'm not
129:25 - replacing this score
129:28 - yeah that's right that's right that's
129:30 - correct correct yeah
129:32 - be careful using cons you cannot use
129:34 - cons to add you cannot change yeah
129:39 - and that's it so now if i say this one
129:40 - more time let's try one one last time
129:42 - guys
129:43 - one last time

133:42 - all right so that's it guys look we've
133:45 - done the rock paper scissors game it's a
133:46 - clean
133:48 - clean application okay um nothing too
133:51 - crazy but the logic is really
133:53 - interesting here for example we learned
133:55 - about objects we learned about functions
133:57 - you know where to call the functions of
133:59 - course we learned about how to
134:01 - manipulate the dom right when you put
134:02 - the dom using the document the query
134:04 - selector we learned about how to hide
134:06 - one thing and then show another thing
134:07 - correct that's one of the things that we
134:08 - did for sure right so a few a lot of
134:11 - things were showcased in here
134:13 - awesome sweet so this point guys that's
134:16 - pretty much it for me your homework if
134:18 - you're in the challenge your homework is
134:19 - gonna be the following of course let me
134:21 - show you the homework where's my
134:22 - homework
134:24 - where's my homework let me show you
134:25 - where's my homework
134:30 - where's my homework
134:32 - swag
134:34 - here are my
134:35 - slides
134:37 - okay
134:38 - oh come on i'll come on here in my
134:41 - slides i hear the following
134:46 - so that's it guys your homework's pretty
134:47 - simple now at this point and i'm gonna
134:49 - create this for you all right like i
134:51 - said i would say for you is you know
134:55 - most importantly guys you don't have to
134:56 - modify anything crazy for those of you
134:58 - who are in the challenge don't have to
135:00 - modify anything crazy i would say for
135:01 - you is honestly just
135:03 - i mean
135:04 - you can make a few things my suggestion
135:06 - of course you can change the background
135:08 - the font the colors
135:10 - i would say add some animation so for
135:11 - example maybe if you win
135:14 - if you win
135:17 - if you win
135:19 - if you win at a jumping animation
135:25 - for the winner
135:26 - yeah that's right
135:28 - right so maybe something like this maybe
135:30 - if you win
135:32 - win
135:33 - maybe add a sound you know something
135:37 - like that right
135:38 - and you can use your uh imagination for
135:41 - this okay one two complete most
135:43 - important is complete this application
135:44 - guys once you complete make it into a
135:46 - homework post right this will be
135:47 - homework post paste it in there and of
135:50 - course after that submit it into the
135:51 - april and that's it my friends so guys

136:02 - scissors game we used javascript html
136:04 - css all the foundations you need
136:07 - we learned what we learned about objects
136:09 - we learned about functions we learned
136:10 - about how to manipulate the dom right
136:12 - and of course we created a game using
136:14 - javascript so that's it hope you guys
136:16 - enjoy smash that like button okay that'd

Cleaned transcript:

guys are doing amazing this is nice and today we are building we are building a rock paper scissors game that's right a rock paper scissors game check this out right i can go ahead and go through this game you've got a score if i for example click on hand the computer will pick one for you right here the computer picks something for you and then basically if it's a tie we'll say it's a tie now let's try play it again if i for example say it's like this oh you lose ah i suck okay and then you lose if i play again let's try another one let's try this one this one it's a tie again damn it let's do this one you win and you see as you win your score increases right here again guys this is a project by frontend mentor so if you guys want to check them out right the link is down below in description of course and i also have the github for you so if you want to follow along with me the whole time right i actually have the full project done for you go ahead go down the description there will be a link right here it'll be this link right here the challenge link it's a github link click download download a zip okay and then you can actually just follow along as i go along with it of course you can use the images that's there on here and so forth but if you guys want to actually fully check it out i would say go to fundamentor and then you should see around here so if i go for the mentor here let's go to challenges yes go to challenge if i just type right paper scissors rock paper scissors right here boom boom here it is so i highly encourage you guys go ahead and just view it and i highly encourage you guys just uh create a creative uh you know a login there as well okay guys alright with my friends hope you guys are excited hope you guys are ready to get started i know everybody is hello hello hello everybody hello adrian hi adrian good to see you good to see you okay those who are on youtube guys you know the drill down the description below follow along uh you know as much as possible if you cannot just watch the video and of course you can always rewind later on all right guys okay cool let's do it my friends so this is what you're going to be building of course the rocket scissors game what is this using well a few things one is going to be using javascript so js and of course we have html and css now this might be a very simple stack but the thing is with this stack is you can do a lot of the stack with this stack you can do a lot of different things and of course with this stack you can you know uh most importantly learn the logic there's a lot of logic that goes behind the scenes and how to actually make this work and that's what we'll be focusing on all right beautiful let me go ahead and make sure this is a world caster beautiful uh amanat if you can please go ahead and mute everybody and please just unmute me thank you i'm all good now all right cool at this point that's pretty much it so the first thing you guys want to do is everybody those are on zoom those are on youtube let's of course you know the drill let's create our new application i'm going to put this to my right hand side i'll put this on my right hand side i don't need this anymore and of course i'm going to create a new project so let's go ahead and go to projects and let's create a new project and then let's right click click new folder and what should we call this project we'll call the rock paper scissors see this right there okay rock paper scissors again empty project nothing inside of that okay i'm going to move my project to the left to the righthand side so i can see some of the code it's getting started in here sorry i just love that song such a good song okay beautiful and then what you guys want to do is go ahead open up file a new window you know the drill file new window open up this right here click open and then let's open up the rock paper shoes game let's go to projects here and a rock paper scissors click open on this one again like i said guys you guys have all the code download it go watch it you guys there's no restrictions on it whatsoever okay beautiful first things first we're going first things first we're going to do is create an index.html file that's of course that's usually the beginning that's why code does not seem too difficult that's right a beautiful so the first thing first we need to do is create an index.html so it's going to right click new file we'll say index.oh let's say uh new file we'll say index.html just like that all right i'm gonna place the music as we're cutting this up of course right and of course let's let's add the boilerplate and you guys know what is the way to add the boilerplate html anybody remember this anybody remember this what is a way to add boilerplate html yeah that's right so just not just tab but exclamation point right here dumb boom done okay done just said bulletproof html is already added by the way okay with this a little bit smaller beautiful all right bulletproof smell let's change the style to be rock paper scissors scissors rock paper scissors beautiful okay and of course now that we if we look at this page right of course there's a lot that's going on on this page that we need to do right it might seem complicated and actually it can be a little bit complicated if you don't know exactly how to divide a project up this into small little pieces guys all right trust me there can be some difficult parts so for us to make this easier i want you guys to tell me okay what would i do for example how would i develop this project what are the first steps and what is the second step let's go and look at this what's the first step we should do to maybe create a project like this anybody know here you're on youtube maybe you're on here what is the first thing we should do to create a project that's right shamar create a wrapper what is another thing we should do make divs yeah make divs that's right so let's think about number one is okay what kind of boxes is this dividing into right but before i even go into that guys sometimes i do this and i want you guys to follow along with me let's go ahead and create a new file and i say plan.md that's right planetmd and so for example i like to create a small plan so for example number one i'm gonna say you know what let's go and create the boxes create the boxes for how it looks like okay number two all right now of course let's figure out how do we make sure that how do we for example right number two let's go ahead and add create the header right that's that the header is gonna be which part the header is gonna be which part it's gonna be this part right here right that's the header right here okay so create the header portion oh the link to the project uh great right here isn't the project i give it to you guys boom the project okay so we've got the header okay after gen creating the header what else do we do guys tell me what is number three what else did we do what is number three anybody know well for me it's going to be to actually create the to that's right well the header is the banner the header is the better i'm going to say to create the rock paper scissors buttons paper and then scissor scissor buttons right so always like to divide these things up because i know that a lot of you guys right a lot of you guys i know a lot of you guys do not know somebody said what the link project what no the link cannot be from yesterday guys if you are in let me make sure it's all good no the link in the description is not from yes it's from today guys you guys are not correct on that one all right good no worries right number four is going to be the following right the one thing i want to think about is is okay well what happens when i click on on one of these buttons right how do we make a decision right how do we showcase who who won right remember and fundamental if we look at our wrapper game it kind of looks like this right we have you know uh basically when you go ahead and say i win or whatever might be of course it's going to showcase who wins as you can see on the inactual picture right so how do we do that that's right user interaction right so basically we just say create an on click event right create an on click event for the rock paper scissors paper scissors okay and then five five the last thing is going to be what after that after you create an unclick so we can have an event what should this event do what should happen when i click on something anybody know those who on zoom lamont david craig anybody what do you guys think right what is the answer that's right what is it who wins that's right right but what should actually happen well when clicking the button right we need to hide we need to hide right we need to hide one we need to hide this portion hide this portion right hide the buttons and show the actual winner right so to figure out a way to hide these things right because remember if i click on this you see it replaces it it replaces the actual content of that div you see so we need to be very careful around that okay great six six okay what now we've hit the buttons we showed this what now what do we need to figure out okay so we figured a way okay to maybe to we figured a way to go to this page okay go to this page what do we do after that to that page not necessary we want to focus on this just yet because remember there's one big thing we haven't done yet guys one more thing i've done that this one we showcased that's what we picked what about the house how do we know what the house picked how do you know what the house but you guys are going to we don't want to think about the score just yet no we're not clicking the score instead we're figuring out hey what is the computer going to pick now that's right that's right we need to figure out what is the computer going to pick so so figure out what the computer is going to pick it's going to pick that's right you see we're figuring out what the computer is going to pick that's part one that's the most important part guys right there's that's right it's a random loop so we're going to pick a random pick basically from that section okay so after we've picked that section okay after we after the computer so we pick this computer picks this what's next anybody know maybe david maybe sam anybody know well here's why i say to that that's right compare the results now you compare results and figure out who wins now awesome but of course we've done this the one thing we didn't account for is we create the header we create the operations game but we did not create the actual view for this we do not create the view for this guys that's the interesting portion right that's an interesting portion so actually after we create the right procedures buttons we need to create the view up for the contest i call it the contest the contest is this view because remember think of it like this this right here is a div it's a div okay it's a div and basically when i play again and this is also a div remember this is also a div right here but this div get this div right here this div right here oops no not this one this div right here gets replaced with which div anybody know this dude gets to play with what div anybody what is it anybody what would it be what do you guys think sam david jay you guys think what is this replaced with i'm winning you guys result that's right with the results right see this replace it now this this div right here replaces the other div you see what i mean so we're swapping the divs is what we're trying to do here right so if you think about it what we've done right now is we created a visual representation of how we want to create an application like this and for all you beginners all you beginners who have the hardest time of starting anything because i know you do i see this every single second i see this every single day oh i have the hardest time starting anything i can copy i can watch tutorials no problem but i can do not know how to actually create something you're not spreading your application into small little parts you see what i mean you think too big sometimes the thing is when we think too big when we think too broad we think too broad and we think that oh this project is so big then this project is undoable for us versus if you make a project and you're like you know what okay well i just have to do step by step you know little step by step that's right right you go okay we'll create the boxes create the header create the right resistance buttons create thank you for the contest create the on click events you know so that's pretty much it my friends you see now we have staffs we need to take does that make sense everybody yes or no can i get a thumbs up can i get a thumbs up beautiful thank you awesome sweet so let me go ahead and continue on let me drink my ah my tea because i like my tea always gives me the power and let's go to minus html beautiful now image html a few things i want to do one uh before i actually go into the body i wanna uh do this i want to change the font style of this whole thing right so i wanna change the font style of this whole thing okay now to change the font style i'm actually using your font cold let me show you here here i'm using this font right here so this is called barlow something barlow so barlow font and the way you guys can get that is if you go to google fonts here google fonts okay and google fonts and then you just select the search up font called barlow okay i'm gonna say barlow right here you see if you just simply go to barlow okay and then you see we have weight of 600 right here all you do is now say we have a weight of 600 you will select this barlow so select this style for example and by the way it tells you exactly what you need to do to actually use this simple as that so for example it tells me hey i need to use this so right here see so i select this 600 and what does it do well i just copy this whole thing i'll place it in for you guys let's have it and i'll just paste it in for myself boom that's it you see and so now what we've just recently done is we went ahead and we imported a new font family okay something i want you guys to really focus on all right next up let's go to our body the first thing i want to create is create a wrapper for this whole body okay so let's do this we're going to we're going to say div deal class is equal to wrapper beautiful all right and this wrapper is basically going to be the whole wrapper of this whole body to make sure the whole body is just a full height i understand that okay understand it all right beautiful so we're doing that and then while we're doing that i'm going to create the css so let's go a new file and i'm going to say style.css beautiful right so the style the css right well we'll do well remember the drill we like to right away update the padding in the margin for everything so i'm going to say over here star i'm going to say padding 0 and anybody know who in the zoom chat or maybe you're on youtube okay and this is not prerecorded by the way if you guys are new to this is not prerecorded this is me okay that's right i need to say code see it says reset so i'm gonna say padding zero why are we doing this anybody know why we're doing specifically yeah but why are we doing padding zero margins here that's right joe margin zero margin zero okay margin zero great why are we doing this well because it's because we want to reset the each one the you know every each one all these p tags they have all these little weird margins and paddings okay okay and so what we want to do is not that so we want to do margin padding zero and then do box sizing border box border dash box right here box sizing border box beautiful next i'm going to do is i'm going to change the font family of the whole body so i'm going to go to the body here i'm going to say here font family okay and i'm going to say the the following found the one that actually told me right so it's going to be like this font family boom barlow condensed sense syrup that's right that's right that's right right to reset the default padding but that's right or die is it is to reset the default padding and margins you're correct on this one right you're correct to remove the phone that's right a bull that's correct right right to kill the defaults amazing job everybody now once we've done that of course once you've done that let's go and save this let's go back to this html so you have nothing inside the wrapper we've created nothing so far but which is okay i want to right away already let's go on an open fly server some of you guys might have the live server hopefully you guys do if you guys don't do this just uh add the extension for live server okay open with live server let's go ahead of course it's a wide screen but that's okay that's not that's not our issue the next thing we want to do is let's go ahead i want to change the background color of actually the whole wrapper and make this wrapper the whole width and height of you know of the what's it called here let's go to style the css one more time and wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute the application go sorry application go right here there it goes i'm gonna talk about the wrapper dial wrapper and inside the wrapper a few things i'm going to give this full width of 100 100 vw now anybody know what vw stands for anybody know what the w stands for what is that website anybody know what does that vw stand for yeah with w basically stands for the whole view width that's right so basically the whole view width which is going to be this whole thing right that's the 100v vw okay great i'm going to say height of 100 vh of 100 vh okay that's the what is the h stands for guys that is what the vertical height that's this height right here that's the vertical height okay and then i'm going to give it a gradient a small gradient and here's a gradient i want you guys to use you guys have it in the file so you guys don't have it so let me go ahead and put that for you i can actually put in the zoom chat if you guys want okay boom boom boom okay and i would put in the zoom chat for you as well right here okay right so this is a radio gradient and let's see save that and we have absolutely nothing anybody know why that's the case well let's take a look at it here video grading it looks pretty pretty good should not be the reason why it's not showing that's going to inspect them but on this one rapper sometimes it just happens for some reason which i have no idea why which is okay oh i know why it's not happening anybody know why this is not happening that's right malisha we need to connect the stylus to the style sheet let's go inside html let's type link and we see link css boom it right away as the style says for us don't have to think about too much hey there we go there is our full on gradient okay there is a fullon gradient beautiful now after the wrapper we've created we need to now go back and now create the scoreboard so let's go with the header scoreboard right i like i like to call it once i div class and again the scoreboard is going to be that's what section that is this section right here okay it's cardboard so div class i'm going to call it scoreboard okay so we're cleaning the specific divs and then within the scoreboard we have what a few things okay in the scoreboard we have what we have the um what is it what do you guys know the title so we have a few things right we've got this uh little title logo i call it okay this data title logo right here of course and we have the score so let's take a yeah that's right title and picture that's right so here here's what we have so number one is div class okay title okay deal quest title and then inside the title what are you gonna say well we're gonna actually link the the title image so those of you who guys again we have the all the assets down below in the description below you can either go to find a mentor we have the access below as well okay so from the actual whole project so if i do this if we go to assets right here here's all the projects all the assets you can just go ahead and click download the whole zip so what i will do is just simply because i already have it inside in here i am going to download it as a full zip so that i can actually get the assets myself let me see download zip hey beautiful let me go ahead and unarchive it beautiful nice i'm gonna take the assets and i'm gonna pull them up i'm gonna put them into my project what will just happen take them and put them all the way in my project right here add folder to workspace yes right here done see oh no i wanted to put it inside here that's right oh come on not inside the actual whoa okay i got a better idea let's create a new folder inside in that case let's call it assets because it's not pushed put in a whole folder for me and i'll just put the images like this right here okay that's much better right there see so i put the assets individually for here i don't need to do this in that case i need to i can just simply remove folder from workspace don't need that and right here so we have the assets folder in here you can just simply add it just the way i did it as well okay now let's go ahead and include our image right we'll say source is equal to what assets and we'll say what we'll say the title.png right there that way if i look at this right here let me go ahead and do this tell the png is not showing up am i doing something wrong anybody um let me see out of that png it's right here right spectacular it's really weird why that's the case i think the live server dropped that's why okay now open flight several more times okay there we go i think the live server dropped that's why it's okay all right so save that so we've got the title next one is gonna be the score card right so let's go ahead and create a score card that's gonna be inside the the scoreboard so day of class right that's gonna be what score boom right there inside that okay inside that is gonna be uh we're gonna create one a score like this and then the number of the score is going to be an h1 like this that's gonna be for now it will always start with zero guys right what what dot is there a dot did i miss something what that sam what did i miss i think i got it right i think it should be good yeah it should be good i think right so h10 right there so now we've got this situation of course but it's not done now let's go ahead and actually modify now something the way i like to do it sometimes is let me show you a really cool trick here so if i right click right click and inspect i'm on this one okay here's a really cool trick sometimes i actually just like to do it myself right away inside inspect elements so i can see how the styles are changing really fast and this is a really cool tool that i like to use personally that you know just helps me out and make things css a lot better so for example if i go to the scoreboard here okay if i go to scoreboard here and i want to change it so for example first things first i'm going to give it a width so here so width oh 700 pixels to give a specific width after that i'm going to say border i'm going to give it a border actually you guys can see exactly what i'm working with one pixel solid solid and it's gonna be white why because if you look at it here right we have a solid white border around this whole thing makes sense beautiful after that we're going to do what well we'll say whatever it is to make it a curvature or the radius and how much do you guys want to give up whatever it is anybody know what do you guys think how much water is you guys want to do i want to say maybe 10 pixels 15 pixels i'm gonna say 15 pixels right here beautiful that looks good okay that looks great yeah sometimes at 2 em that works too 2 am all right then after that what's going to happen let's move it a little bit more up so let's do margin top if i want to push it from the top side what i guess you would i use guys if i want to push on the top side so margin top margin dash top is going to be equal to what 50 pixels that's right right so that's push it to the top don't worry about this whole thing don't worry about it that's going to happen okay don't know whether just just yet okay don't worry about it just yet all right yeah that's right 10 pixels 50 pixels after that what i want to do is let's also so we have a width let's also give it a height we get a height of 150 pixels okay beautiful right and then what we want to do guys you see how currently wrap up the scissors what does it look like well it's here then this is here we're going to put the score to the right hand side what do we do anybody know you guys know at this point right on zoom on youtube what do you guys think display what display flex my friends that's right so we'll do display flex yeah beautiful display flex okay and you can see it went from left to right now how do we push to use away from each other how do we push this away from each other so make sure it's all like this what do we guys use let anybody know anybody know well we're gonna use what justify content you guys can play it for me justify content what yeah space between that's right space between a beautiful okay that's exactly what i want to do it's exactly what i'm doing nice beautiful now the next thing for that is let's go ahead and go to our what um our this how to make sure this wrapper you see this wrapper is great but how do i center this whole little thing in the middle anybody know how to send this whole little thing in the middle anybody know that's right display flex as well the place by effects as well so i'm gonna go with the wrapper here and i will say display flex flex a display flex and this can be what direction are we gonna do it with remember we have the top we have top and bottom what direction are we using guys anybody know what is it what is it anybody know i'm waiting for you guys column that's right so i'm going to say flag design column so i'm going to say lex lex direction column that's it right column okay and of course you guys know the drill this point if i want to center this horizontally i'm going to say align item center like this okay that's it you see i have sounded the way i wanted to do okay beautiful next up inside the scoreboard of course i want to make sure this is also centered of course so i'm going to say justify content space between what about the vertical alignment guys what should i do here for the vertical alignment what do you guys think well online items center right there see now it's all centered like just how we wanted to center right so now we've got the scoreboard that's beautiful we've got you know uh this let's now take a look at the actual score card which is which one the actual this score card right here let's talk about this one i want this course card to also be a certain way so i'm gonna give this scorecard a with off 150 pixels okay and a height of 114 pixels okay next thing i want to make sure that it has a color of what what color do you want to make sure it has well let's take a look at it you see we have it's like a it's a box right so it's a box right here and what is the background color for this box well one it's white so let's do that right now so let's do background color color white beautiful of course right and then of course we need to have a border radius for this one so let's do border radius radius is going to be what what is the border we are speaking we should give it guys maybe eight pixels like this i like that okay good good good good good now of course after that we have you see that we need to add some space in this to the right hand side how much basis should we have guys anybody know what do you guys think i will say what maybe 30 pixels so on how do we do the spacing anybody know how do we do spacing if i want to add more more space at the right hand side what is it yeah margin that's right so i'm going to say margin right margin that's right and i'm going to say here what 30 pixels yeah exactly right 130 pixels beautiful that's right that's right i need to yeah okay that's correct that's correct okay beautiful let me go ahead and make this a little bit smaller one second hey guys i won't be able to read all the comments yeah i'm actually using vs code that's right i will use this code here in a second okay i will use this concept i like to do this so you guys can see this really fast right after you've got the score what do we need to do everybody so we got the score everything is good of course we want the score to be centered so what do we do if i want to put the score the zero in the center anybody know what do we do going to use anybody know those on zoom what are we gonna use do with the score in the center what do you guys think just curious yeah a line yeah so well first thing you display flags on this one so display flex and this one of course and it's left to right but we want we wanted to have it like top to bottom so when i say what yeah so i'm going to say flex direction column right that gives a top to bottom section and i want to say what justify content center this is for her vertical alignment now and then align items what center that's it right that's kind of how it goes right there look it's looking a lot beautiful already right um beautiful sweet i love it okay next up what i want to do is i'm actually going to just copy all these styles that we just created and i'm going to you this one they want to add is for this title if i i'm going to add a small padding for the title here so i'm going to say padding left here or margin left here margin left because just how we have the padding for the top right section i'm going to add the margin for the left section too boom let me see here beautiful right there see looks so much better yeah knitting it's text line won't work so well in this situation like this okay so that's it guys so why do i do this very simple sometimes i like to just test it out in my you know inspect element and then i will right away put it into my actual application so now check this out now all i have to do is the following i right click i go to here right and i will slowly do this so i'm going to go back to my style of css i have the class wrapper here so i'm going to say wrapper and i'm going to give it all the styles that i copied here so display flex select direction copy this of course and then paste it in boom done you see what i mean boom done done and done so the wrapper that's so good after that i go to the scoreboard so let's go to scoreboard here so the scoreboard same thing i'm gonna create a class here called scoreboard okay and i'm just gonna copy all these styles right here right copy all these scholars to scoreboard boom done you see just like that after that i'm going to create what i'm going to create which uh style i'm going to create the uh i need to focus on the title section so i'm going to say scoreboard what i'm going to say that title so i'm saying that title okay same thing margin left 30 pixels so copy this one right here good after that one we have the score that we focused on let's go to score one right so we have now that score that score and i'm going to copy everything from there into there right boom beautiful all right what's up cannon how are you my friend awesome sweet so let's go ahead and save that and now we've saved this right we put it into our celsius set if i refresh this okay see it's default it's just how we did it how do you order formula you should have a prettier if you're not if you're not out of format you should have a prettier right here a prettier so you want to use an extension called a prettier extension to do that awesome sweet so we got that portion uh next up is i wanna change these colors a little bit and modify the actual uh h1 so i'm gonna say right here dot score h1 h1 okay and i say give it a color color and i'm going to say the color is the following you guys the color is this one right the color is this one so if i save that and i'll go to my application here's the color right here see that's the color of the h1 right that's the color okay yeah that's right harshal looks much better now okay sam your images should be working sammy just download the whole thing it was just if your image is not working it's because you put the assets folder in the right in the wrong folder sam you have to put the assets folder in the right folder okay okay so try it one more time there's no reason why your images should not be working my friend there's literally literally no reason whatsoever no reason period because it's a simple html application so if you have your index.html make sure your access folder are inside if you don't see your if you do this and you don't see access folder disappearing you did something wrong that's right there's something wrong right and if you go to for example your index.html right if you want to actually add that's this folder right look this right here means homepage that's where it means hey go to the homepage and then go the assets folder and as you're doing this you should actually have it so dash assets dash title png and of course make sure you have the live server move your images or change the folder name yeah that's right do not change the folder name do not move your images guys okay do not move your images there's a large code and will appear when i add to asset it is a large what somebody talking about sam no it should not be so if i have here let me show you guys here i have my app purposes game main which is downloaded okay and my access folder is here here's all my images take all these images and just drag them into right here just drag them that's all you have to do sam just drag them that's all you got to do my friend just drag them in okay you don't have to do much more than that okay just drag them in you can even go simply to your whole folder so if i just simply go to my projects folder right rock paper scissors here just drag the whole folder into here as well that will work as well okay that's it we want to make sure that you do continue with us okay beautiful so we've got the the h1 let's go back to my style the css go back to my style.css okay yeah good good thing retro that's right that's right yeah there's there's there's no you guys can get it if if sam if you can't get the images working i'm sure you can trust me i'm sure you can you just have to copy in the right direction that in the right way that's it i have my full i have a full confidence you can okay next one i want to focus on the score one this title right here score it says right here right so let's do that right now so i'm gonna say score score p tag done so right color color changes now the color is gonna be the 2a whatever this colors is called right let's give it a different font size font size of what font size of 16 pixels okay and then save that of course and then let's do a font weight of 600 of 600 okay and then let's do line height of 19 pixels just so it's a little bit higher right there beautiful okay and after that let's go ahead and give it a letter spacing of 2.5 pixels boom nice and then honestly that's let me see here um that's pretty much it the only thing i don't like is like i feel like this number is a little bit bigger this h1 i feel like it's a little bit bigger okay and that's pretty much it i think the reason why this is bigger right here is because i need to go to find a different font size sam did you get it by the way sam the color my friends is going to be the color right here sam just keep trying man you just keep trying you just keep trying make sure the folder your assets are on the right folder that's it what what do you mean about missing info what do you mean download go to the download it's here right here code download the zip here code download zip that's it code down the zip and then then your assets folder should be in there okay unzip it guys unzip it unzip it once you download it good and it should be right there there's no reason why yeah right here unzip it from here that's it and here's your assets folder guys okay got it got it yay okay cool you got it sweet nice yeah i just you know i don't like small things like these to just to for us i do not i do not like it when things like these like you prevent us you know from containing like small things like you know do not allow you guys to continue on so then font size or 56 pixels guys and of course that's pretty much it so if i do that save that hey let's go so here's our whole scoreboard that's it our scoreboard is done right so if i go to my plan right the header which is a scoreboard scoreboard is done i like to call it it's done so right let's go to the rock paper scissors buttons of course now we need to create this one this is going to be a little bit more difficult guys but that is okay the way i want to do is the following right if i go to my index so we have scoreboard what should we call the next section which is let me play this one this section what should we call this anybody think right what should we call this section what should we call this section well we i'm gonna call this section the uh main i'm gonna call it hands like which hand did i pick that i picked this hand this hand so i'm gonna call it actually hands guys okay i'm gonna call it hands okay so i'm gonna say say df class boom okay do class hands boom and then inside that is going to be very simple inside that is a few things we've got our left hand okay we've got this one this one of course and this one okay so let's do this right here we'll have the class is equal to what is equal to um paper so we're gonna have paper as a hand as well right then i'm gonna have which one div class okay i will start adding javascript in a little bit after we have the hands done okay div class scissors because like there's no reason to add javascript if the html is not done it's as simple as that guys okay there's no reason that javascript if the is not done then javascript is useless scissors and then we have div class dev class is equal to rock done gif class rock okay then i go to my uh and i'm going to add a few images one of course we got the left image right here got the left images okay why use html because graphic we use html because well pages are made from html this is not a react.js application it's a javascript html it has application okay so let's do this right now now let's do the image if you want to create html using javascript then be my friend go ahead okay then i'm gonna do the assets okay assets okay and then i'm gonna give it a that paper.png so first it's going to be paper.png the next image is going to be which one guys and there's next image so i image image source is equal to what acids oops like this okay assets and which one p uh what is this one this is the scissors one right so scissors boom and the last one is gonna be image source is equal to what assets and then i'm gonna give it what a and okay hand no actually no which one rock paper no rock that's the one rock that's right so we got these images okay let's see what actually how it works out okay let's see hey we've got it nice nice beautiful beautiful so okay with that with what we have so far of course okay we've got these images in here but of course they're not functional there's nothing going on here so let's go ahead and make them functional let's go to stylus css and the first thing i want to work on is actually going to be well it's hands right so the one thing i want to work on is the following so let's go ahead and do the hands boom oops that's not the one right well again we want to go where make sure these hands come from left to right like this right all these little hands go from here to here right the way i want to think about it like this i'm going to constrain my box no way i'm going to put my box like this i'm going to create this div right here and give it a session of width in a way where this will go here this will go here from left to right and then this is still going to go left to right but it's actually going to wrap and go to the next line it's going to wrap to the next line rosa asks why did i not add slashes good question don't have to add a slash here honestly because this slash means root folder that's what this means roots folder and um the inside html is actually already in the wood folder so that's why we did not add that slash in here i mean i can actually remove this it doesn't matter too much honestly but right sometimes i do it because to make sure it is for it it's gone from the roof because let's remember access is inside the root folder guys okay okay as inside the the root folder so let's do that hands and inside there uh a few things one is going to be what let's give it a specific width i'm going to say width is going to be it's going to be 476 pixels okay and then after that we're going to give it a height of 430 pixels boom okay so now it's again it's top to bottom but now the specific height and width that we are constraining it to right then i'm going to do this i'm going to take this up and say display flex flex okay see now it's from left to right great no problem now of course it's still not wrapping though like why is this still not wrapping let me see here for a second look at this if you look at our hands you see you see how we have we have constrained the actual box so it's smaller but this rock is actually outside the box as you can see if you guys can see that right there see it's outside the box not necessarily flex direction left retro not necessarily all we need to do is say this flex wrap wrap boom see right there just like that so it wrapped the next line right away you know if you constrain it actually magic it's going to look amazing and mobile actually so you're wrong on that one because if you're looking for the mentor it's going to look amazing as you can see yeah it's about how you design it you can always make out everything it may look amazing if you design it properly that's it so so then we're going to do justify content center to make sure it's all centered here eh you see now it's all beautifully centered i love it look we're already already already in a much much better position okay next up i want to give some margin to push this to the top right here so what am i going to use anybody anybody know what i'm going to use well i'm going to use the following let's say flex wrap no not flex who knows what am i going to use do i use what do you guys think margin top that's right so margin dash dash top like this our desktop and i'm gonna say what let's give it a about 100 pixels boom done okay so now it's that now of course now we've got this one thing you guys want to see is you see how we have this triangle thing right here you see this triangle triangle zoom zoom see this triangle well it's actually just an image that's right it's actually an image that's correct okay it's actually an image so if you took a look at it let's take a look at our image if i took a little image it's going to be the strangle so assets triangle.png this is the whole image right here boom right there you see so this is an interesting way how would you put this image behind these three little buttons anybody can anybody think of how you would do that just really curious can anybody think of how you would do that but this absolute no um yes osada background image okay background image that's right the easiest way is going to do background something for example i'm going to say background image here i'm going to put it here on the top i'm going to say background image url okay i'm gonna say assets right here and this one i'm gonna say triangle if you guys have the um the actual this page i'm you i'm saying i'm doing this if you're actually using i'm saying this right here right i don't need to do that anymore because my assets are directly inside i'm in all i'm inside the root folder right now you know currently you know here i'll be split this up into folders of css that's we have to do the dot dot slash to go back to the root folder you see that's how we did that but anyways just wanna make sure you guys are clear with that okay as i struggle the png let's see if i save this what's going to happen here oh yeah that's pretty crazy huh that's right retro now repeat so let's do back on repeat back on repeat back and repeat no repeat i save that so now it's in the left section what do we now need to do to put it in the center guys anybody know no not absolute yeah that's right back up position center so now i'm going to say background dash position center a look at that much much much better right much better guys okay now you see how there's more space in here than there is here what do we do with that one what do we do here anybody know what do you guys think well a few things we just add some margins so for example i'm going to go now to the um the nssg model you see how there's scissors i'm going to say okay so dot scissors that's the one the righthand side i'm going to give it a margin left margin left of what margin left of 20 pixels okay and then for the other one the dot what the dot uh what do you guys think the dot no what is it what is it again the dot paper the paper that's gonna be margin what anybody know margin what margin what for the paper what margin we want to add zoom right yes retro margin right also 20 pixels save that hey look at that guys how cool does that look huh how cool does that look how cool does that look so cool sweet that was pretty amazing just like that we have our pretty much score game that's pretty much it we're done hope you guys have a great day and i'll see you guys tomorrow i'm just kidding all right next one all right so next one is going to be well if you think about this okay i want to make it so that when i hover over this they have like this really small like feeling off you know of it's an actual button okay actual button what do you guys think we need to do to make it count like that what did you get something to do to make a cow like that yes hover but hover on what how do we set the hover you see right now we have all these different divs and it's a little bit weird honestly right well if i'm gonna do this check this out here's what how here's how i can do this and you have to be very careful to make sure it fully works so i'm gonna say the hands every single this oh that's not the one for this one i'm gonna give it a hand class because i want to target them all in the same way just like that okay uh the github link is here guys can somebody please paste the github link that'll be great you got you guys have it i think okay so if i do that and give it a hint that means if i go to my style of css i can say hands down hand yeah transform translate or fake that's right transform translate that hand okay i'm gonna say hey one i'm giving a cursor pointer okay because now you see how it is a pointer you see right there it's a point now and then what i'm going to do is on the hover of this hand so the hands on the hover of any hand again i think ahead i'm giving the same class because i want every single item to act the same that's i'm given the same class guys i wanted to act the same so that hand boom boom boom i'm gonna say transform and i'm gonna give it a translate it's called a translate so right here i'll show it to you guys right here it's called translate so transit 3d is going to basically translate the button this is gonna be xaxis this is yaxis so basically minus eight pixels is up eight pixels is what it's going to do so if i save this look at this if i hover hold on oh that hit hover i forgot about this one go point go point okay i'll do this one oh but of course it's jittery right we don't want that that's not a good user experience so what do we do we just add a small transition so we say transition 0.25 seconds done boom hey there we go and we my friends have created the transition that we need that is right that's right that's right that's right that's right beautiful that's all good that looks amazing now the question is of course what's next you've got the hands are complete all right there's no plan here doesn't everything look good next one is what we need to create the view for the what for the contest okay create the view for the contest now of course um a few things we can do i can actually go and quickly for the contest or we can work on this create the unclick click event just in case we can do some javascript how about that guys okay shall we do that let's maybe go and skip ahead a little bit and just pull into the javascript portion and then we can always do the contest here right after so let's just do that one that's right newton okay good so let's go ahead and do that so to create the javascript portion again um i'm actually going to follow along just the way i did it here with js so let's go ahead and do that let's create a new folder called js boom inside here i'm going to create a a javascript called index.js so i hear new file let's call index dot oh it's not creating it index.js guys beautiful all is good the well all right now okay let's think about this okay what do we want to do what do we want to do once we you know click on something what do we want to do what do you want to do what do you guys think what about zoom youtube chew that's right choose right you want to choose it right well um not in not a hr link and nature of link is about taking to the next page we're still on the same page we're not trying to any new page not necessarily joe we want to have we can add in event listener but i'm going to do a little bit differently i'm going to create a function called the pick user hand right so when i click on one of these buttons needs to call a function to actually pick for it right so to actually make some functionality happen so we can we can actually pick the next the computer can pick as well so you know so we can start playing this game right so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna create a function i'm going to say const pick user hand and i'm going to pass in a hand here now you might be wondering what kind of a function is this not this is called the arrow function guys those are completely new it's called an arrow function and it's a new way to write functions inside es6 usually you would do this you'll say function function pick user hand right same thing guys this is the same thing as what this is right but no we're using error functions for now because that's the new the new kind of latest ingredients i guess you can say right something you said here link the js file that's right magic man that's good so we need to link the gs file as well so let's go to ins.html and everybody know how we link the html file or the script file so we'll say what script or you can even use a shorthand i call it script source right here see shorthand ammo variation enter enter and i'm going to say what js slash and is the gs done done that's right asada on click to the html element so now check this out right we have a function called pick user hand basically this is going to be cold whenever you pick something right let's go to our organization and what we can actually really do which is really really cool is on the click of of an image we can call a function on click look at this guys on click i'm going to call this function called pick user hand pick user hand just like this right here unclick pick user hand right unclick same thing with this one unclick pick user hand right also to a function same thing with this one unclick oh on click pick user hand as well right here and that's it my friends pick user hand so go ahead and save that that's right that's right that's right so pick the user hand but of course we need to tell this function what do we pick do we pick this this this we don't know otherwise otherwise just one key right so what we want to do is actually make it so we know exactly we picked so for example if i select something i'm going to say what for this one i'm going to say what do i pick here i'm going to put it into a quote here i'm going to get a parameter i'm going to say here what paper nice then i'm going to say what this is going to be what scissors sellers okay great then i'm going to say what then it's gonna be what rock rock that's right okay paper scissors and rock just like this so save that right and so let's take a look at how this actually works guys i'm going to console.log this hand parameter console.log hand boom console.log let's see what actually happens in here so okay save that right click inspect element so we know we're working with boom console guys got it now let's see if it actually happens okay wait that's that's actually that's actually the one that's already built this one oh it's not happening oh okay oh because inspect element i didn't set the wrong one let's do console oh look at that guys boom rock rock rock rock rock crack rock rock see see there says see so what this tells me is now i've connected my html to my javascript you see my goal is to pass the data that what i clicked on to what to the javascript portion that's the goal guys all the time okay that is a goal all right that is a goal beautiful okay sweet guys sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet so we've got this consola log hand okay awesome after that what are we going to do i'm going to do it we have picked the hand now and of course we're going to do we're going to do something with the hand what what should we do what's the next thing we should do guys anybody know what should happen inside this function guys what should happen i wanna i want you guys to think for a second here what should happen inside this function zoom youtube sam okay we can do that yes we can put into variable but technically this hand is already available um the choice is already saved it's this one so remember guys when we click on something let's look at what happens here i click on it what happens yeah display the hand on the next page that's right so we want to what one show the next page with the hand you picked you picked right but we also want to hide the current page yeah hide the current page right we want to hide this page right we've clicked on i'm going to hide this page and show the next page guys that's correct that's right so it's actually hi so let's actually hide this page how do we do that well we can use something called a document that creates selectors so for example i'm going to i'm going to create a variable called let hands let's go to document that what query selector query selector and i'm going to give that uh the class dot hands okay and on this one i'm going to say hands anybody know how do you hide an element anybody know so the hands by the way the hands how do i do this is because this whole element is has a class called hands by the way now how do i hide the element anybody know that's right display none that's correct so i'm gonna say hands dot what dot uh style dot display play is equal to none that's it right so it's gonna be display none everybody right so if i take this boom it's gone so you see we've gone the first first portion it's now gone but of course now we need to create the next we need to create the next portion now all right this is where it might get harder a little bit let's go into it the next portion i'm going to call it is with an inside it's going to call it a contest okay let's go i'm going to call it a contest the hands are all good that's not a problem here all right let's create another div after the hands and we'll call it the contest so div class contest and this is where we'll show you the results okay now of course if you look at my results alright what do we have you know what boxes do we need to create to actually showcase the results anybody i want you guys to think about what box are we going to create inside here anybody know okay anybody know thank you monolith what box we're going to create here guys three boxes okay one two and then what and then three that's correct right one two three one that showcases which what you picked one the showcase is the winning selection who went who lost and then another one for the computer choice so let's do that right now okay the first div div class is going to be the user hand so div class is equal to i'm going to say user hand okay close this one out and this user hand has a few things of course what do we have inside this username what do we have guys we have what the title and then we have the actual what anybody know the actual image so let's do that right now so we'll say here h1 that's gonna be what you picked okay you picked some image and let's for example and then let's wrap this image around the div so i'm gonna say div class is equal to hand image container boom and for now what i like to do guys is i know that we need to have the actual image that we should have but i actually like to have a placeholder image one key thing you can take away from this is whenever you're creating something and something changes all the time but you don't have the javascript yet just create placeholder code create placeholder images so for example i'm going to create a random image i'm going to add a random image here and say image image right source source is equal to let's just say this is assets and i'm going to say um paper why not doesn't matter too much right now if we look at it what do we have you picked right but if i close this out look at this if i hit this disappears now we have this right so now we're working with something awesome sweet our next one let's go and pick which one our next one is going to be the you win right which is which portion the center portion which is going to be the dish portion right here okay i'm going to call the referee portion so div class okay referee boom dunzo referee it's good for free and this one let's say day of class is equal to what is equal to decision now the one thing you need to create is this this decision right here so you know you lose you win going to say div class decision here like just like that and then i'll put an h1 tag inside here and aside i'm going to say you win for now again temp this is temporary data okay you went again placeholder data okay and of course we need to have a created button so i'm gonna say give class there's the new game button to new game your game like this new game that's right magic i'm going to set the edge of the image later on new game and this is going to have the text what text play again play again right here okay so save that okay hit this to remove this you win play again okay okay no no no no issue here nothing too crazy next one let's create the next one just gonna be the computer hand right so the contest that i was that's right i'm excited too so i'll say div class what should we call this one guys anybody know what should we call our next computer computer section if you call this user hand what should the computer one be what do you guys think what should the computer one be zoom huh okay actually kind of like a house hand or we can say computer hand oops not this one hold on we call computer hand yeah you call house hand too actually yeah okay inside that as well same thing we have on h1 this is what the house picked okay okay great okay and then of course and then of course after that one is going to be we're going to get another day for the image day of class if class is going to be a hand image container hand image container boom and inside there's gonna be an image again placeholder image guys okay placeholder image thank you sean appreciate that my friend all right i'm gonna say image oop i'm gonna say image and source is again placeholder image just for now i'm gonna say assets scissors why not okay also all placeholder images no need for that okay so if we pick something again this will again so now we can work with something like this okay so yeah you picked you win the house picked okay we've got this content that's gonna appear randomly later on okay let's just style this content for now let's style it right if i have this let's go to my style the css let's just touch down the actual full on what the actual following contest so one one first things first i'm going to give uh create a class i'm going to say um that contest because remember this is the the whole wrapper is called contest right here and for this dog contents contest will say well let's give it a width for now of 900 pixels okay 100 pixels okay why'd i do that because it's supposed to be a little bit bigger if you look for the mentor you can see that if i go ahead and just simply think is a little bit outside these boxes you see it's outside the boxes right here that's wow okay nice so with 100 pixels next up is we're going to say dot contest and the dog contest now of course guys what do you guys see on the contest section okay what do we need to do to make sure you know of course one it's a little bit weird right now because we don't have what there's one thing that we don't have right now it's top to bottom we need to make sure it goes from left to right what do we need to do anybody know why didn't you do anybody know well you display flex display flex hey that's right display flex sean that's correct right now here's an interesting one we display flex no problem whatsoever all right let's now maybe i want to change the images to be a little bit bigger so i'm going to say contest image i'm going to say this is what has a width of 275 pixels and a height of 275 pixels right here so now the images are a little bit bigger okay which i like a lot okay now what i want to do now okay is something very interesting how do i make sure that all these divs are in here they're equal width what do i do and we talked about the last time guys those who are new to those who you are what do we do we're talking about the last time not a line we're not going to going to align it no that's right grid may also work but it's actually going to be the following i'm going to give every single one of these now flex column i'm going to get every single one of these divs right here a flex one so what does this mean check this out if i do here dot contest i'm gonna give it a say div now what this means this right here means contact the divs right under so so that contest i'm i'm going to target just this div this div just and this dip right here because you see how there's diff inside this div if i do this without that then it will target all the divs this one and this one this one and this one to not target it i could do like this meaning hey target the the one that's the closest okay to the contest and now i'm gonna say flex one check this out you see what just happened all of a sudden we just changed that's right every single div is exactly the same width now it's weird the way it is right now but don't worry we'll figure this out okay flex one i'm going to add some margin to the contest i'm saying margin top top of what or 50 pixels just like this okay to add some space into it all right and then let's not target the h1 so i'm going to say that contest boom under h1 i'm going to say color white color white right so i want to change these titles right here to the color white i'm going to change the font size font size to be what to be 20 pixels nice so it's a little bit smaller okay i'm also given a margin top for this specific h1 let's say margin top here of 12 of 20 pixels as well and we'll give it a margin bottom of 50 pixels to push it away from these buttons right there let's see that's it much about 20 pixels beautiful and then i'm going to say this one and say text align center to put it in the center oh you see that's it right now i know it's not fully still centered but then don't worry about it we'll figure this out in a second here okay hopefully in a second the one thing i want to figure out now however is well uh the what what do you guys think a few things let's talk about the actual uh the you know this right here this right here so we have these and what you can see is you see this right here is centered so i just want to show you just how these work out so we have the contest and you can see how every single div is centered exactly not centered exactly but has the same width everything has the same width the left the center and the right why because flex one flex one says hey you know what this is saying hey the the importance of this div is the same as the importance of this div which is the same as the importance of this div that's what that means if one of these divs has the importance of flex 0.5 this step will be much smaller just let you guys know how that works out okay so we're given the same exact importance it's all about importance guys html likes importance likes to feel important that's right now let's look at these images you see hand image container what do you see right well it's you see that it's not standard actually correct how do we center this image inside this div who knows come on let me know guys ninten that's correct one fr one of our that's right grid may also work it's correct but zoom what do you guys think how do we center these image inside this div anybody know yeah that's right so display flags on this one right so if i do the simply display flex flex and i say align if i say justify content center boom see it just centered it just like that beautiful it's so easy not that's right that's it so to target this one inspect helmet you can see that what am i targeting here i'm targeting hand image container that's why i created the class because i want to be able to target this and this together all right so let's do that right now so we'll say dot contest dot hand um image container hopefully this works all right and i'm gonna say display flex beautiful and then justify content that's it that's it now it's centered perfectly okay next up let's work on this section right here right here this section right here this section right here okay one uh need to make this bigger two you need to center it in the center so it's all in here okay uh how do i do that well let's go down to downside that referee referee okay referee okay again how do we make sure guys you know there's the drill how do we center this you win and play again so let's see here you everybody know you guys know the drill the drill the drill the drill it's so simple the drill justify content and what and what justify content and what that's right we put that's correct you put into a column that's right sam so number one is put into a column so we'll say display flex right see and then i and i put into a column so i'm gonna say flex direction column it's a good catch on this one okay but man call remember just columns puts it from top to bottom but how do i center them sam or how do i send them uh le monde how do i center those that's right align items i'm going to say this one i'm gonna say align items center and just forgot you guys can see i'm reusing the same the concepts are the same guys the concepts are the same there's so much you can do with just a few if you know the most some of the most basic concepts that are really important in coding and look at this you win and this is so much better all right so much better okay now let's go ahead and change this you win so i'm going to say here dot referee h1 i'm going to give a font size font size of 45 pixels beautiful that's correct asif and brian that's right okay okay and then after that uh well at this point i want to now focus on the actual new game button so let's do this one now okay so we got this play again button let's focus on this new game button right this new game button is just this it has new game okay so let's do like this we'll say that new game that new game like this beautiful all right first things first we need to give it a background color so let's say background color of what white that's it white right now it starts to white now one cool thing you can understand in order for us to create this into an actual button yes we can give it a width we can give the height one cool thing though here's what we can do and you can remember this for your whole life okay it's a really cool trick that i use all the time a button is not really about width and height it's not really about that a button is about a piece of text and then you telling that piece of text to have a specific padding and push the button out that's all you are doing my friends so if you want to create a button that surrounds a piece of text it's like you are taking for example you know let's just say this this little airpods i have here and you're right you're and you're saying hey you know what you know put space here i want you to put space here put space here put space here put space here and so now it becomes a much bigger square or circle whatever it might be okay so back on white after that i'm gonna say padding i'm gonna say give it a padding now the first this is a shortcut for you your first one could be top and bottom so i'm gonna give it 12 pixels this stands for top and bottom both top and bottom okay the second number stands for 24 pixels that says for left and right guys so this stands for top and bottom left and right i can individually say top bottom left right i don't want to do that okay that's not for me so look you see it just simply expanded guys that's it it's simply just expand it okay next up let's go give it a border radius and that's going to be what six pixels okay six pixels nice job save that okay look at that starting liquid button let's give the cursor pointer nice let's go ahead and give it a transition transition off actually forget tradition for now do not want that um let's go and change the color for it here's the color guys this is an interesting color as the color looks a little like this boom this is the color i put a few guys in the zoom chat here boom that's the color guys all right everybody that is the color right here so the color is like this oh there see it's starting to look a lot a lot a lot better now let's make an interaction button so it's going to create a new game that hover so we'll do a new game hover i'll put create a hover section okay um after that we're gonna number one let's change up the background a little bit so background color here's sometimes what i like to do for example i like to like alica you know how it gives me some options like bisque beige let's just call it a bisque right now because if i hover this is like a very small difference you see very small difference and then i'm gonna say transform i'm going to actually transform it up so when i click when i hover over it it feels like there's a button there right there transform translate 3d minus two pixels boom boom now right there see but of course because we don't want to have it to be jittery what do we need to to do to make sure it's not that jittery guys what do we do anybody know what do we do what do you guys think what do you make sure that it's not it's not jet jittery so it's smooth what do you guys think on zoom le man yeah that's right transition oh sada that's right so i'm going to say transition here transition and that will be what transition on all zero point what 15 seconds see that hey look at that so much better of course it does nothing for now but this is not where javascript comes in guys so we have the you know play again a beautiful my friends beautiful so look at that so guys look at this it's pretty much there if i refresh the whole thing of course this is here but don't worry about that if i click on it see so okay now let's think about like this now this is where the jealousy comes in we've got these two pages they are there no problem we need to think about how do we interact with it and show the right stuff well for one when we first start out okay this shows right now we have a where this shows let me go ahead and remove this this show is showing and this is showing which one do we actually need to show which only which one do we need to show which one the top one or the bottom one the top one in the show or on the bottom one now tell me which one way to hide the bottom one or the top one which i'm going to hide now the the which one the bottom one that's correct the bottom one so to hide the bottom one right if we go to stylus css it's the contest right you see use the display flex well let's change it to display none for now for now it's not for now it's unnecessary for now it's not necessary but you see it's just hidden no problem that's right now when we go back to instags check this out we're hiding the hands but we need to show the contest so what can we do with that now we need to hide this portion needs to hide which it is using this you see i'm going to show this portion so what do we do same thing let what let contest is equal to document dot query selector beautiful i will say dot contest dot contest right so we're going to grab the actual div contest and anybody know for those of you who are on zoom i know on youtube you might know some of you guys might know dorsey and zoom how do we change what do we do with the contest how do we show the contest now guys what do you guys think lamont craig what do you guys think sam how do we show the contest if here we have display none to hide it what can we use to show it necessary oh flex that's right so instead of displaying none i say display show well yeah it's kind of like show yeah so i say contest style dot display it will take you back to flex because remember before it was flex so now check this out guys ready them boom yes of that we hit one we showed another one that's it and so we just keep doing that back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth and back and forth okay let's refresh it again see right there boom see right there refresh again beautiful so we got that portion okay awesome now of course when we click on something right we need this to actually show the correct you know well what you picked what you picked so what do we do currently we have a placeholder paper the png well how do we change it well again document the query selector guys here let's create a comment here um i'm going to say set the user pick i'm going to say the following let's say document dot get element now i need to actually grab this image it's hard for me to grab this image and there's no id so let me see command z i'm going to give this image an id and i will call it user pick image user pick image save it user pick image right here guys okay yes i just say gala element dot get element by id i'm going to say what is it user pick image and i will say what dot source is equal to what this is the interesting portion is equal to what is equal to what this might something be really complicated for you right remember we have this we know what we picked here is equal to what we're changing the source to the source that needs to actually be correct so if i clicked on this the hand the source needs to be paper or if i clicked on scissors the source needs to be scissors if i clicked on rock the source needs to be rock right there guys well not necessarily him because if i do this that's not going to do anything for me right so if i click on that it's just it's a weird image right so i'm changing the source guys remember see if i right click on this one i'm changing the source you see this one just became hand so this is what we need to think about this for a little bit here well how about this i'm going to say like this i'm going to say if if hand is equal to let's just say a rock i'm gonna take this right dot source and i'm gonna give the source of what or let's just say the source of what that's right oh good good that's a good one i saw that actually it's a good really good one that's a really good way of doing it you can say well it's right here it's assets assets slash what rock dot png right so let's try that i'll click rock see now it's rock guys you see now it's rock but of course i want to do the same thing for you know the scissors and everything else i can actually make this a little bit shorter for you check this out i'm going to create a dictionary object some of you might know might know that it is some you might not a dictionary object is a key value pairing it's like when you go to a dictionary and you open up the dictionary right inside the dictionary you have the word and then the definition for that word i'm going to have the same thing here i'm going to have a word and for that word instead of having definition i'm going to have the url to that specific word so all right let's do this i'm going to say const and options now this is something that's a little more advanced guys options i'm going to create a dictionary object okay again dictionary it's literally like a dictionary with a key value appear the key is the left hand side the value is the right hand side so for example i'm going to say a rock here this is my key this is my key the right hand side is going to be the url for that key so the url is going to be assets slash rock.png boom okay what is the next key that's right it's a data structure that's correct what is the next key this is why algorithms and the other searches are so important guys next key is what paper right paper so i'm going to say dash assets dash paper dot png boom dunzo and the last one somebody tell me is going to be which one somebody tell me in the zoom chat scissors that's correct scissors bomber that's correct come on let's write scissors so scissors again dictionary is an important data structure that you guys absolutely have to learn it's one of the most used ones that i personally use i've always used at work and it's something that yeah something we teach very much in the boot camp assets slash i'm gonna say what scissors dot png got it guys scissors dot png right there okay save that okay cool that looks all good no problem now how do we use this actually right it's just there but we don't use it we'll check this out i don't need this if anymore that's right it is kind of like json you're right it is kind of like json you're correcting that one that's why json can really be easily transformed into an object so instead of having source like this this out i'm going to use the hand options i'm going to say hand options i'm going to get the value using the key of the hand remember when i click on something this hand can either be a rock a paper or scissors right either one of these three values okay okay so whatever depending what it is if it's hand let's just say for this if it's a uh a rock if this value is rock it will go to hand options and it will find rock and give me this value that is what this does i'm accessing the actual object it's not 0 1 2 it's actually a key value pair david an array has indexes of 0 1 2. this is key values it works based on keys it's like when you take a key right you unlock your key with your uh to your door the key is the actual word in this case the hand is the key the value is what you unlock after you put the key in okay guys just so you guys understand the hand is the key this is the value you put this key in into the hand options let's just say it's rock it will give you the value it's kind of that's right bummer it's kind of like case statements you're writing this one it's a mapping that's right you call the value hassan by the key so here's the cool part because of this shortcut not only can i reuse this everywhere in my application but the shortcut allows me to just have one line to do everything that i need to do that's it so if i for example select this hey look at that see it picked it if i select this it picked it again if i select this it picked it right that's the cool part about this it just makes it so much easier for us whichever one you pick is gonna be the one that's it all right cool so we got that portion that's the pick right that was taken care of that's right it is it's very impressive it's very interesting for us just if you use data structure like this yeah it's javascript it's pretty cool and you guys haven't seen anything yet so now look we picked ours okay we picked our hand but how about let's use let's have the computer pick the hand um not asada sometimes but the thing is osada is like sada says hey can't you just use concentrate the path and go to the location you could in real life however the path might change the path might be different the path might look completely crazy so sometimes you cannot use the name so the you cannot sometimes it's better to have a mapping like this because you know later on you know what if i change this path to have to be different name you know and so if i use this dictionary i can only change it once okay i have to change it once and then everywhere else is still working okay oh you missed a lot retro you missed a lot don't go to the bathroom next time i'm just kidding go to the bathroom you have to all right so we've picked our hand now the next porsche is going to be well let's have the computer pick a hand so i'm going to create a function called pick computer hand it's actually not the heart pick computer computer hand okay pick computer hand that's right pick computer hand okay so let's go ahead and have the computer pick some kind of a hand as well okay so um let's do that well okay what are the options that the computer has what are the ops the computer has has rock paper scissors so let's create those options i'm going to say let hands is equal to what equal to either this i'm going to use an array this time that's right sam i'm going to use an array why you'll see why and there is a list of items so i'm going to say here rock then paper paper then scissors right so the computer can choose from any of these ones right the beer is going to choose from it that's right we're going to use and so we're going to use now is we're going to use a math.random because check this out right for example if i want to console log let's just say here i want to con i want to let's just say i want the computer to pick you know paper all i have to do is say this hands at the position of one this is position zero this is an address right well what this is is an address just like how like you have an address to your house everybody right an array has an address to its elements this is address zero this is address one this is address two that's right okay so for example let's go ahead and check this out right i'm gonna i'm going to call this function right now pick computer hand some say console.log pick computer hand no not because all the log i'm not actually called a function sorry take computer hand boom let's call the function okay let's call this function okay and i'm going to call this function and so now if i go right if i click on something like this let me see here inspect element on this one console you see i had the computer pick paper just the way i wanted to hands one is paper that's what i had to pick paper that's it guys you see so now now that we know that now that we know that okay all we can do is the following let me see here okay now that we know that let me see here for a second what i can do is kind of like this i can go ahead and you pick a random number what if i used math.random to pick a random number and have it pick rock paper scissors based on that okay so i'm going to say let cp hand that's the one it's going to pick is equal to hands remember we can say zero or one or two well what we can do instead of j of zero one and two let's have the computer pick a math.random what is math.random well it's kinda like this i'm gonna remove this i'm gonna say math.random just so you guys know it as well with me you see math.right now returns a number between zero and one so it can be 0.5 0.3 0.4 whatever well but you can make it any number so for example if i say math.random okay i'm actually going to multiply it by the length of these options because for example if if the if math.random says 0.5 0.5 times 3 is what what is it 1.5 right 1.5 correct you see so depending on what on what it is so for example right let's say we're gonna multiply this by three let's say math.random picked 0.9 okay 0.9 0.9 0.9 times 3 what is 0.9 times 3 is how much right there see 2.7 just like that okay 2.7 all right so that's what i'm going to do here now based on that what we can do is we can round the number correctly so right 2.7 now is 2.7 closer to 3 or 2.7 closer to 2. is 2.7 close to three or two what do you guys think two three that's right so we need to some some find a way to round this right so for example let's go ahead and and round math math round what is the best run number that's right see so i can do math.round to round to the nearest number right so if i pass it a for example 5.95 it will say six if i pass 5.5 i'll say six but if i pass this 5.05 it will say five so what we're gonna do we'll say math.round that's right math.round actually no we cannot do that actually we can do that because no that that should be um let's see 0.12 3 3 3 0 1 2. we can't really okay never mind so we can't really do math.round we have to do math.floor why let me show you why math.floor is gonna take it to the bottom so let me show you why because if we do math.round we can we can it will give us a three number three but the problem with that is this is zero this is one this is two remember computer goes from zero to two guys right go from zero to two right so we can't really do three we have to always go to the bottom one and math.floor what that does is the following math.floor math.floor i want to show you floor returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number so for example if i do 5.95 it will always tell me 5. 5.05 is 5. so always say to the bottom number the closest whole number right to the bottom that's what floor does okay guys and so because of that if i if i get 2.73 0.73 what am i gonna get what index am i going to use two or three anybody know two or three that's right obama two right so this will be scissors okay if let's say somehow i got 1.73 1.5 what am i gonna what index am i going to use one what if i got 0.95 what am i going to use zero that's correct you see that's right so that's how that's being picked guys okay and so all we did here is look math out random pick a random number multiply it by three and use mata floor to just you know i call it florida that's what i like to call i call florid right so now we've picked our hand guys and once we've picked our hand what can we do now well we've picked our hand let's actually change our hand on the right hand side right here whatever is inside here and just how i did it here i'm gonna copy this portion right here you see boom document dot get l by d user pick image source handout but of course we can't do user pick image no we cannot do that we can use what we need to create a new id for this one so this i'm going to say what computer pick image to change this was this one so it's like computer computer pick image let's copy this one save that computer pick image go to inside.js instead of this one i'm going to grab the one that's computer pick image and i'm going to change the source based on the options but not based on the hand but based on what anybody know not based on the hammer based on what this is b that's right somebody asked the question why do we multiply by 3 because math.random gives us a value between 0 and 1. and so we need to increase that ability so that if it's 0.5 it's actually 0.5 times 3 which is 1.5 you see what i mean so otherwise you know it's just going to be between 0 and 1 and so we're not gonna be able to get like scissors we need to be able to get to bigger numbers right that's always how we use it that's right cp hand and let me show you how this looks like guys let's let's take a look at here for example i'm gonna say console.log log log cp hand cp hand comma cp hand boom oops that's right magic man that's right to save that let's go back to our rocket procedures game okay now if i right click right click inspect them on this one let's click on it boom you see it picked scissors as well you see that's what i picked if i try again epic now rock so that's what it's doing it's picking specific ones right based on the random number based on a random number guys that's a really cool part so look we've got that now let's go ahead and actually return ours our uh what's it called our suggestion what do we pick so here i'm going to click return cp hand return cp hand now i'm going to attorney why because i'm actually going to capture here i'm going to say let cp hand here is equal to pick up your hand so basically i have the user hand which is here right i called the user hand and then i have the cp hand the computer hand right okay we've got that we've got that amazing but here's my question what now what do we do now well now we decide who's the winner and who's the loser cause let me say you you look like ill must thank you i do look like elon musk a lot of people have said that right so now we need to decide let's let's now go ahead and create the referee function say const referee const uh referee is equal to two two two two beautiful right so we're gonna pass in two parameters what parameters are we going to pass and anybody know what parameters are we going to pass in there's two ones and there are three i need to have the referee hand and then which hand do we need to have the which one the computer hand and the which one guys what do you guys think and the user hand that's right so i'm gonna say user hand here comma cp hand now this is just now a bunch of if and else statements guys just be patient now with me it's a bunch of if and l statement so for example guys okay if i know it's a little bit crazy if user hand is equal to right paper paper right and ncp hand is equal to what scissors scissors who wins right then who's the winner guys am i the winner or no am i the winner or no who's the winner the computer is doing right and technically i lose so we need to tell me that i lose so i'm going to create a function called set decision const set decision basically to tell me that i lost is equal to decision right and i'm going to console log my decision for now right so tell me i lost guys okay all right so now what is my decision am i going to say set decision here what am i going to say guys anybody know i'm going to say what you lose i'm a loser that's right i'm a loser okay that means i get no points i lose okay but what if else if what if my user hand my user hand is equal to for example paper and the cp hand and just so you guys know where this means and so both of these need to be true and the cp hand is equal to rock then who's the winner do i win or do i lose switch statement is a certain could work but the thing is because there's switch timing actually would not work sorry in this one switch that would not work that's why i win i'm the winner so now i say what sad decision you win you win just like this right now i win but i also need to increase the score so let's go ahead and create another function called set score const what set score is equal to here's the new score that we have right and consol log the score right let's set the score right so i can increase on my current score console.log that's right consider log score okay now how do i set the score if i'm going to set set score how am i going to set the score i want you guys to tell me i want you guys to give me your ideas what did you guys tell give me your ideas there's a few ways to do this okay a few ways to do this that's right score plus one well let's go and create actually a variable called let's score the one that's gonna keep track and it's gonna initiate from zero let's score initially it's zero and so when we do set score i'm going to say score plus one i'm going to increase that score below one and so now we have a new score that we can use everybody see that that's right ashika increase the count that's correct all right increase the count all right so we got that portion that's all good now guys i love it but what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy and paste i have all these if not statements for you here okay i'm going to copy and paste all of these ones for you right here if user hand cp hand right you guys can kind of and look at these ones these are all also inside the github guys go ahead and check it out by uh below okay check it out below those of you who are on uh zoom i'm gonna copy this for you as well and just paste it in for you come and see you guys can just copy and paste it okay because there's no point of me just writing all this out it's all about a bunch of decisions and you can see there's only a few ways that i win if i have the scissors and the sap hand i score plus one and if i have that rock and score plus one so it's kind of then otherwise it's a tie this really depends on what happens all right so guys what do we have here there's a three and a few ways only to win here just won't let you guys know that okay but at that point you have a referee a referee will set the score and will tell us what's who's the winner who's not so let's go ahead and actually do this okay hopefully you guys copy and paste it just copy and paste it guys that's it just copy this portion that's it you might not even need this else if you just then you can do you don't need to add this alphas if else if as well just remove the else that portion just to make it easier for you those you are on youtube yeah i can do it for you too here hopefully i'm not sure if i can actually no i cannot sorry i cannot put it in youtube guys sorry i have a limit of how many i have a limit to how many uh how many characters i can put into the comments so that i can't do it unfortunately but that's okay okay those are you on zoom did you guys get it give me can i give me can you give me a thumbs up you guys got that yes david got it thank you sweet beautiful all right if you're gonna go spin for draws that's right so now okay we've got that portion of course you have a decision so now the interesting is what happens when we set the decision to you win or you lose okay you win or you lose okay decision is you when you lose so if i do this okay great let me see if i inspect what do we say here console log refresh it doesn't do anything why do you think it's not doing anything because why because we're not actually calling this function guys we need to call this function so remember we have the referee we get rcp hand now we call the referee function and we say here the following we say referee okay we first we pass in our hand our option and then we pass in the computer option cp hand boom save that beautiful inspect element on this one and console and now i will say this you lose you see the house big you lose because why i picked scissors that's in the freshest one more time boom it's a tie right there that's it my friends that my friends is it okay then friends is it beautiful let me go on now go back the one thing we do see the score is not currently or setting correctly let me see here uh because i need to win actually okay great so we got that portion let's go ahead and do this for decision we need to change this to you win or you lose depending on the decision it is okay okay here you guys want the github yeah here's the github guys for those of you who are on youtube this is the full code guys those are on youtube here's the full code okay you guys can use it all right let's set the decision remember decision is where is that where is inside here to change that all i have to do is do document that what the query selector right class like this dot decision and i'm going to say dot what the inner actually that decision h1 right the inner text text is equal to what is equal to decision that's right that's it so now for example you see i'm going to replace the text with a decision that i passed in either you win or you lose that's what's going on and so let's try that right now save it you lose makes sense let's refresh it one more time okay it's a tie beautiful one more time a it's a oh damn again holy moly come on oh i want to win come on give me winning one and i win right just like that okay beautiful so that's already working guys we're almost done so close guys so so so so close next one same thing with the score remember guys we need to set the new score same thing if you go to any html the score is where the score is here and we can change that so we do dot score so document the query selector selector we say dot score right and we need to modify the text within the h1 so that score i'm going to say h1 as well correct and i will say dot inner text is equal to what score that's it so now ready let me do this you lose okay so there's no score again so refresh this two you lose oh dang i keep losing every time boom you oh come on give me something you win and look the score increased by one just like that guys just like that it's already working guys at this point everything is almost done there's one last thing finished last thing that we need to do which is what this play again button we need to make sure that we can play again after i added the above i got them wait your file couldn't be accessed may have been moved edited or deleted um i don't think so i want to make sure you have the whole function my friend so here sam copy this whole function the referee function and just replace yours here right here there's the whole referee function copy and paste it okay that's it my friend okay cool so save that beautiful now one last thing is play again button so again with this one we're to create a function called play again so let me do that right now it's going to be called restart game so let's go and create a function const restart almost done guys almost done beautiful nice okay i'm liking this okay and then what do we need to do to restart the game remember to initialize the game when we do this we hide this box this box and we show this new box but just to go back to the page what do we do now what do we do guys who knows we do what we that's right hide and flex it hide and flex it i didn't flex this now we reverse the psychology now now we say the following we go back to our see this contest right here where we display none i'm actually going to copy these ones right here coming from pick user hand paste it into here and i'm going to reverse them so now the hand is actually what display what flex versus the contest which is this one is display what none so look okay but of course it's not going to work because we need to uh we need to actually call this function so let's call this on the click of the play game function let's do this on click on click i'm called restart uh game right there save beautiful all right we restart the game all right my friends let's try this out okay first out boom all right you win score added play again hey another one you win but hold on score was not added hold on it's a tie you lose you lose you win why is this score not added it just does not keep edit that's interesting let's score the inner one does not increase more than one for some reason why is that the case i'm really curious the restart game my friends was put inside here you see this day of class new game i put an on click on this restart game so it's looking like it's working but hold on it's a tie okay you win plus one you want but it's not increasing anymore plus one why is that the case hmm that's interesting why is that the case they're so close i'm so close score zero oh i know because i need to actually set the score so i said to say the new score is equal to score remember we're adding one here but we're not actually saving that the new score right i'm adding one as a parameter which is being added here but i'm not replacing this score yeah that's right that's right that's correct correct yeah be careful using cons you cannot use cons to add you cannot change yeah and that's it so now if i say this one more time let's try one one last time guys one last time boom you win okay score one boom you lose you lose you hey score two again score three alright guys how about this question okay let's actually play this game guys you guys tell me what to pick and we'll see if we win or not you guys tell me in the zoom and in this in the youtube chat what do i pick and i will pick that specific thing let's say rock paper bull hand hold on i mean not you need to give me rock paper scissors rock paper scissors oh that's the hand okay so i see hand hand okay okay if you vote for hand say hand put a zoom chat hand if you both hand i see a lot of hands okay i see a lot of hands okay let's see you guys all right all right let's see let's see let's see it i'm gonna say in that case and ready and what is it oh i win let's go beautiful so it is a hand let's play again one last time what do you guys think i see now rock okay if you if you want me to put rocks a rock hey let's do rock now rock and oh damn you guys are good okay okay okay okay one last time one last time what do you guys remember to pick one last time what do you guys think i saw right i picked paper paper again craig okay paper again okay let's do paper now holy moly you guys are good okay okay okay okay okay can we keep the streak going okay what's next guys tell me tell me what's next what do you guys think what do you guys want me to pick hand again see le mans says scissors okay le mans says scissors okay let's see who okay scissors okay let's try it okay guys ready ready scissors okay ready oh you lose lamont come on i'm kidding so there you go guys but we're not done yet i want to actually put this live for all of us to use so let's go and do this guys remember the drill how do we make this live for you guys to use let's go to netlify number five not netflix not netflix not the fight netify not legitimately fire okay i should have picked rock craig says all right now let's fight all right okay you guys on the drill now at this point let's go ahead and open this up i'm going to log in with my notify account which i already have okay you can sign in with github whatever you got you you got to do okay i'm going to go to sites and all you have to do is you know you see how this scrolls to the bottom you just have to upload it so let's go and go to projects rock paper scissors game i'm going to take this whole folder guys take this whole folder and just move it down like this just move it down like this and boom a beautiful move it down let's see is it published now i think it's published so if i look at it now let's see if it's published open it up it's published right there you i'll give you guys the link all right i'm gonna give you guys beautiful i'm giving you guys the link that's it my friends my friends this is done so for those of you who are on youtube thank you very much what i would say to you now at this point i'll tell you something all good sam just just continue doing this this will be on youtube maybe you're going to rewatch some portions sam okay all right so that's it guys look we've done the rock paper scissors game it's a clean clean application okay um nothing too crazy but the logic is really interesting here for example we learned about objects we learned about functions you know where to call the functions of course we learned about how to manipulate the dom right when you put the dom using the document the query selector we learned about how to hide one thing and then show another thing correct that's one of the things that we did for sure right so a few a lot of things were showcased in here awesome sweet so this point guys that's pretty much it for me your homework if you're in the challenge your homework is gonna be the following of course let me show you the homework where's my homework where's my homework let me show you where's my homework where's my homework swag here are my slides okay oh come on i'll come on here in my slides i hear the following so that's it guys your homework's pretty simple now at this point and i'm gonna create this for you all right like i said i would say for you is you know most importantly guys you don't have to modify anything crazy for those of you who are in the challenge don't have to modify anything crazy i would say for you is honestly just i mean you can make a few things my suggestion of course you can change the background the font the colors i would say add some animation so for example maybe if you win if you win if you win if you win at a jumping animation for the winner yeah that's right right so maybe something like this maybe if you win win maybe add a sound you know something like that right and you can use your uh imagination for this okay one two complete most important is complete this application guys once you complete make it into a homework post right this will be homework post paste it in there and of course after that submit it into the april and that's it my friends so guys that's pretty much it those are you on zoom you feel free to stay those of you on youtube guys thank you so much for watching this has been an amazing application we finished the rock paper scissors game we used javascript html css all the foundations you need we learned what we learned about objects we learned about functions we learned about how to manipulate the dom right and of course we created a game using javascript so that's it hope you guys enjoy smash that like button okay that'd be much appreciated subscribe for more videos like this of course we have we have more videos coming up tomorrow so come back tomorrow at 11 am pst where we are building a sas product a sas product so come back tomorrow and we'll put that with you as well okay other than that i hope you guys have an amazing day and i'll see you wait wait wait wait in the next video those are you on zoom feel free to stick around
