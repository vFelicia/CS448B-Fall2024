09:31 - could drop your youtube chan
09:32 - channel and tell me what type of roast
09:34 - you want and if you wanted me to be nice
09:36 - you could say i want a decaf
09:38 - all right so

09:47 - do that at some point today
09:49 - yes okay awesome so
09:52 - we'll do it yes great it'll be great so
09:55 - on that we
09:56 - talked about how to break through your
09:57 - first 1000 subscribers but what's
09:59 - important is i want you guys to be able
10:00 - to believe that it's possible for you so
10:02 - i want to ask you guys
10:04 - do you believe that it's possible for
10:05 - you to break 1 000 subscribers
10:08 - yes or no yes yes yes okay
10:12 - you guys saw a video of a of a fan a
10:14 - picture of a fan
10:15 - with the sound of a fan for eight hours
10:17 - and it has 33 million views
10:19 - and he has 1 million subscribers so it's
10:21 - possible maybe for you
10:23 - to have over 1 000 subscribers yes
10:27 - yes okay yes that's really important
10:30 - because if we don't agree on step number
10:32 - one there's opportunity that exists or
10:34 - step number two you can have a first
10:35 - thousand subscribers
10:36 - we can't continue on to day three day
10:38 - four day five
10:40 - so with agreeing that that's possible
10:43 - now we come to the point of is it
10:44 - possible for you to be able to make your
10:46 - first
10:46 - one thousand dollars from youtube that's
10:49 - what we're going to talk about
10:53 - okay feedback feedback feedback a lot of
10:56 - feedback so
10:57 - one thing is keep your guys mic if you
11:00 - can if you have background noise
11:02 - especially
11:02 - please it would really help if you keep
11:04 - it muted if you have background noise
11:06 - and then when i'm asking questions just
11:08 - open your mic
11:09 - and then jump in cool guys it helps a
11:13 - lot by the way when you guys jump in and
11:15 - actually talk because
11:16 - right now when i'm if it's just me it
11:18 - just sounds like i'm a crazy dude just
11:19 - talking to myself
11:20 - but it's really exciting when you guys
11:22 - jump in and
11:23 - chat it seems like we're all sitting at
11:25 - a dinner table or we're just all sitting
11:27 - around like a fireside chat and having a
11:29 - chat
11:30 - so that's why the participation in that
11:32 - connection really helps plus i do
11:34 - believe that that level of participation
11:36 - will move you physiologically to then
11:39 - start your own
11:40 -  cool so multiple benefits of it
11:43 - selfishly for me
11:44 - and then selfishly for you all right so

18:32 - then at some point if i find a way to
18:35 - ask for a sale
18:36 - i might just get it right you guys get
18:39 - value
18:40 - i get value we keep the world moving
18:41 - forward make sense
18:43 - yeah yeah yeah so so this is the thing
18:46 - that
18:47 - um a lot of the stuff is a lot about
18:49 - mindset right like
18:51 - if you don't get past your ten dollar
18:54 - mark
18:54 - you'll never get to your 98 000 mark
18:58 - you'll never get to your beyond six
19:00 - figure mark you'll never get
19:02 - so this is the hardest part that i want
19:04 - you guys to
19:05 - take a look at and really really
19:08 - internalize because
19:09 - if you can really internalize this and
19:12 - this doesn't phase you
19:13 - and you actually start falling in love
19:15 - with it those are the people that are
19:17 - actually going to make a breakthrough
19:18 - and start something
19:20 - this is the part that you actually have
19:22 - to get through this is the hardest part
19:25 - but if you are like i'm not gonna go all
19:28 - in until i get so like let me show you
19:31 - something right let me show you guys
19:32 - want to see what happens
19:33 - a little bit after this like month of
19:36 - because this is we're looking at 2016
19:38 - right so do you guys want to see what
19:39 - happens when i move it
19:41 - just a little bit over into 2017
19:44 - just a little bit ahead of this sure
19:47 - right so if i go
19:48 - to 17 take a look at this and
19:52 - i'll i won't even go too far out i'll
19:54 - just go to the month
19:55 - of february um and
19:58 - we'll just go just a little bit farther
20:00 - out than november take a look at this
20:02 - okay you guys see the number of
20:04 - subscribers
20:06 - and now the revenue is getting into hey
20:08 - this is a good side hustle now
20:12 - but if you're not playing all out
20:13 - beforehand then it doesn't
20:16 - then it doesn't work for me another
20:19 - thing i want to share with you guys is
20:20 - take a look at this
20:22 - i started to the channel started to take
20:25 - off right here
20:27 - it wasn't taking off here can anybody
20:29 - tell me why the channel wasn't taking
20:31 - off here
20:36 - it's like a lot of time in the beginning
20:38 - for sure i think you made no videos at
20:40 - that time
20:40 - maybe you didn't make as many videos i
20:43 - didn't i wasn't making videos
20:46 - right right now talent matters those
20:50 - things matters but you guys saw that you
20:52 - could have a
20:52 - video of a fan and that can potentially
20:55 - blow up like
20:56 - crazy like that right i'm not
20:57 - telling you have a channel about that
20:59 - uh just to make extra money but like you
21:02 - could if you wanted to
21:04 - here's where i started taking off where
21:05 - like i was actually posting
21:07 - a bunch of videos and then pretty
21:10 - immediately
21:11 - after that right like how long did it
21:13 - take me to start taking off
21:15 - after i started making my videos
21:19 - how long so little time it's very little
21:23 - time
21:23 - like literally few weeks i started
21:25 - getting traction
21:28 - so that's the thing about if you really
21:32 - commit
21:33 - so if you don't commit then that change
21:35 - doesn't happen but if you actually
21:36 - commit and go
21:38 - in then it works now your question might
21:40 - be hey
21:41 - what does that mean i might be busy do
21:44 - any of you guys like how many people
21:45 - here have
21:46 - jobs you're working full time or you
21:49 - don't have that much free time like
21:50 - raise your hands if you're already like
21:52 - you got something going on and you don't
21:53 - have like
21:54 - not you're not full time like free
21:59 - right so we have a lot of us have
22:01 - limited amount of time i saw robin
22:03 - raised her hand i saw stacy
22:05 - clara gilberto um
22:08 - so when you don't have unlimited amount
22:11 - of time
22:13 - what i want to tell you is these videos
22:17 - that i made that actually started
22:18 - putting me on the map guys
22:21 - these videos took me i spent
22:24 - one hour every day
22:29 - between 9 p.m to 10 p.m i would work i
22:31 - would leave
22:32 - at 6 00 a.m i would go to my college
22:35 - then i would come
22:36 - i would be done with college around 3 4
22:38 - p.m then i would go do my part-time jobs
22:40 - and i would come home at 9 00 p.m so i
22:42 - would leave home at 6 00 a.m
22:44 - i would come home at 9 00 p.m and not
22:46 - between 9 00 p.m to 10 p.m i had a
22:48 - one-hour window
22:50 - that was the only time i had available
22:52 - it was just that one hour window
22:55 - within that one hour window i had to
22:57 - make things work
22:58 - because at 10 pm then i had to go back
23:00 - to sleep
23:02 - right so in that one hour window is
23:05 - where i created my videos
23:07 - do you guys do you guys have do you have
23:10 - a one hour window in your day
23:14 - yes or no one hour yeah sure yes yes
23:19 - so i asked how long were the videos you
23:21 - were making at that point
23:23 - adam yo what's up so the videos i was
23:26 - making at that point were between
23:28 - uh 20 to 50 minutes
23:33 - so you just did so there wasn't much
23:35 - editing going on i'm finding that it's
23:37 - taken me
23:38 - you know a couple hours at least to add
23:40 - music and do all this stuff
23:42 - yup so for me when i had limited amount
23:44 - of time
23:45 - i think it's worth learning how to edit
23:47 - but i don't think it's worth if it's
23:49 - gonna stop you
23:50 - so i would i made my process so i had no
23:53 - editing
23:54 - i never did more than one take um and i
23:57 - just like
23:58 - i would think about what i needed to
24:00 - speak about and then i would just do it
24:04 - how many videos did you bang out in like
24:06 - a month or like per day as well
24:08 - i was i started doing one a day for for
24:11 - quite a bit
24:12 - and then i started to slow down as my
24:13 - channel started taking off and i had to
24:15 - like
24:15 - focus on different things
24:18 - [Applause]
24:20 - but like i mean i'll show you because
24:23 - like reality is just reality so let's
24:25 - just take a look at
24:26 - what the actual stats say so
24:29 - i'll move this over to 16 the first
24:33 - you know i got started and then we'll
24:35 - move this over to
24:37 - um move this over to december
24:43 - cool so let's go here so if you actually
24:45 - look this week i produced eight videos
24:47 - you guys see the dates september 1st
24:50 - september 2nd
24:51 - september 3rd 4th 5th 6th
24:54 - 7th 8th all of these were published
24:59 - right so eight videos that week eight
25:01 - videos this week
25:02 - four videos the week after that five
25:05 - videos the week after that
25:06 - eight videos a week after that nine
25:09 - videos a week after that
25:10 - eight videos a week after that eight
25:12 - videos a week after that
25:13 - two after that then
25:18 - took a week off then two videos and then
25:21 - four videos and you guys see that like
25:23 - and then i just exploded
25:27 - but uh hi qazi i have one question may i
25:30 - ask you now
25:31 - uh yes you can ask me just give me one
25:32 - second the explosion was caused by this
25:35 - guys
25:37 - see what i'm saying yeah
25:40 - yeah and something weird i'll tell you
25:43 - to this day
25:45 - a lot of it comes from this to this day
25:48 - four years later
25:51 - that's pretty cool right so that's a
25:54 - really important thing to understand
25:55 - about
25:56 - youtube you're essentially putting in a
25:58 - lot of work ahead of time and for
26:00 - free to create opportunity and leverage
26:04 - for yourself right okay
26:08 - all right go ahead um uh go ahead
26:12 - okay uh thanks so my question is that
26:15 - uh as you started i think four or five
26:18 - years ago
26:19 - let's say four years ago so you you said
26:21 - you didn't actually do a lot of editing
26:23 - and everything
26:24 - so but now the market is kind of maybe
26:27 - different
26:28 - into uh 2020 and not true you saw you
26:31 - saw a video of a fan
26:32 - right now you saw a picture of a fan huh
26:35 - for
26:35 - 10 hours and has 33 million views yeah
26:38 - yeah so okay yeah that's that's true
26:41 - that's true for sure yeah yeah yeah
26:45 - so yeah a very good fun but by the way
26:50 - yeah you're enjoying this nice
26:53 - so um go ahead i still want to listen to
26:56 - you
26:56 - go if you didn't finish your question go
26:58 - for it okay
26:59 - yeah so basically i can if you i'm not
27:02 - sure how
27:03 - the time will go i can take maybe one
27:05 - minute if possible
27:06 - sure i actually uh work full time i mean
27:09 - i work at a very good company i
27:11 - i'm like i work at ebay actually if i'm
27:13 - like oh nice
27:15 - you're working at ebay right that's
27:16 - clear so i actually saw your video
27:19 - uh like on on facebook first and then i
27:22 - was really
27:23 - i'm sorry curious and i joined today i
27:26 - mean i was probably
27:27 - late i'm sorry
27:31 - i'm sorry it's okay bro it's okay but
27:34 - but the thing is i mean i had one
27:38 - channel like
27:39 - a few months ago then i posted i think
27:41 - four or five videos
27:43 - and i also posted my channel link here
27:46 - then i was really i mean i'm really busy
27:48 - that's for sure but
27:50 - then i lost my my enthusiasm or you know
27:54 - everything then for last few months i
27:57 - have not posted any video
27:59 - but i mean as i work professionally for
28:02 - last 10 years
28:04 - if i can spend some time i even have
28:06 - like all the
28:07 - equipments which is needed i have my uh
28:10 - mirrorless camera canon m50 i have my
28:14 - microphone camera like
28:16 - yeah i have i have everything literally
28:18 - which is needed
28:19 - to begin or got a nice chair channel so
28:23 - yeah i mean but i'm not getting that
28:25 - that you know power
28:27 - in in my mind that i can i should invest
28:30 - a good amount of time and really do that
28:33 - but i really want to but
28:34 - i'm losing that power so can you choose
28:38 - how can i do that yep so here the
28:42 - here what's happening my friend is
28:44 - you're not like whatever it is that
28:46 - you're gonna be making content on
28:48 - that's not something either meaningful
28:49 - to you or you're not enjoying
28:52 - you haven't created a process that you
28:53 - actually enjoy
28:56 - right like why do you feel like you're
28:58 - not making content
29:00 - like you have all the equipment you have
29:01 - everything even though i want to make
29:03 - sure that you guys understand you guys
29:05 - hi olivia
29:10 - nice to have you here uh your audio your
29:12 - mic is off right now but i just wanted
29:14 - to say hi
29:14 - because i remember we went over your
29:16 - channel yesterday
29:18 - um awesome so shajada think about that
29:22 - think about i want i want you to think
29:24 - about that like why are you not making
29:26 - why are you not making videos like you
29:27 - guys don't need anything outside of a
29:29 - phone
29:30 - so it's important like what is stopping
29:32 - you shajada
29:34 - like i know you said go ahead that's
29:37 - same question to my mind actually
29:38 - because are you do you enjoy
29:40 - the stuff you're making content on
29:43 - i enjoy but i think somehow i'm also
29:46 - kind of
29:46 - lazy to that i'm not lazy personally i
29:49 - work
29:49 - hard i work a lot study a lot you know
29:52 - in technology world how it how it goes
29:54 - but i think when i start making videos
29:57 - there i'm really lazy
29:58 - right it's not because you're lazy it's
30:01 - because you one
30:02 - either don't have clarity of plan most
30:04 - of the times we lack clarity
30:06 - yeah um you know how can you be lazy but
30:08 - you are working a full-time job like it
30:10 - doesn't even
30:11 - matter exactly you know what yeah i mean
30:12 - like i even work full-time
30:14 - i think he's fine
30:19 - i think it's like the important thing
30:21 - here sujata for you is
30:23 - you're not lazy so you have to one
30:25 - change that internal dialogue the
30:27 - important thing about it is
30:29 - you have to do it in a way that you
30:31 - enjoy there's something about this
30:33 - process
30:34 - that you're doing it in a way you're not
30:35 - enjoying and two you're not giving
30:37 - yourself a clear plan
30:39 - so the best way that i did it is the day
30:42 - before
30:43 - okay youtube isn't something you do
30:45 - normally right youtube isn't something
30:47 - for most of you that you do normally
30:49 - maybe just for some of you if it's not a
30:52 - normal thing
30:53 - you're not just gonna do it randomly one
30:56 - day like
30:57 - there's no cue in your day that's gonna
30:59 - cause that br behavior to get triggered
31:02 - right it's not like for me i can drink
31:04 - water randomly i need it to survive
31:07 - right i can eat food randomly i can talk
31:11 - to a friend randomly because those are
31:13 - things that i enjoy so much and they're
31:15 - just kind of
31:15 - there they're just gonna happen some
31:17 - people develop a habit of exercising and
31:19 - that that happens automatically
31:21 - here if youtube is not a thing that you
31:24 - do
31:25 - it's not a part of your identity then
31:27 - you have to plan
31:28 - a day ahead or that day
31:32 - once you see can i ask you something uh
31:35 - yes go ahead so basically you're saying
31:38 - that we need to make it a habit
31:40 - and enjoy it right yes
31:44 - thank you thank you cozy yeah go for it
31:48 - yeah so i actually had a question so you
31:51 - know how you were saying like
31:52 - when you uploaded multiple videos in one
31:55 - week
31:55 - yeah you got more revenue and more
31:58 - people
31:59 - liked what you're doing right
32:00 - [Music]
32:02 - so would you recommend that we
32:05 - record say i start my youtube
32:08 - channel today okay yeah and say i just
32:12 - i've recorded a python course and i
32:15 - edited
32:16 - everything and i have the separate
32:18 - videos and everything yep
32:20 - should i publish one out every single
32:23 - day
32:25 - you can yes and then would that
32:29 - get me to the same point of when you
32:31 - started to boom
32:32 - or would i still have to wait in that
32:34 - sense so
32:35 - okay so this is where it gets tricky
32:37 - this is where you have to
32:39 - like what i'm getting paid for is
32:42 - essentially uh
32:44 - being willing to handle a lot of
32:47 - um i have really high tolerance to
32:51 - things not being clear entrepreneurs
32:55 - get paid a lot because they can handle
32:59 - uncertainty
33:00 - the more uncertainty you can handle the
33:03 - more
33:04 - likely you are to like actually succeed
33:06 - in this journey
33:07 - if you're looking for certainty you're
33:10 - this is not
33:11 - a good area for you to be in so like
33:15 - if i do this exact thing will i be in
33:17 - the exact same place
33:18 - i don't know bro you could have 20 views
33:21 - or maybe 10 subscribers or you could
33:22 - have like 20 000 subscribers
33:25 - it's like that part is out of your
33:28 - control
33:29 - what's in your control is the amount of
33:31 - effort that you actually put into it
33:33 - so if you can put in x amount of effort
33:36 - and do it for a prolonged period of time
33:38 - and don't see it
33:39 - don't be so driven to the results and
33:41 - the numbers you will succeed
33:43 - like there's literally no way you can't
33:46 - youtube is safer than
33:48 - any job you can ever dream of
33:51 - because at
33:52 - the worst case scenario and this is what
33:54 - i always say to people
33:55 - worst case scenario if everything goes
33:57 - to hell i can just ask for a job
34:01 - like i can go to my audience and i can
34:02 - be like hey is there anybody who has a
34:04 - job for me i can
34:05 - you know i can do a job true so
34:08 - yeah you see what i'm saying so
34:10 - ultimately it's like building
34:11 - relationships like all of you guys are
34:13 - here on this call
34:15 - worst kid worst comes to worst and
34:18 - everything is over i'll be like hey do
34:19 - you guys have any like
34:20 - people that are looking for a job one of
34:22 - you guys might be like yeah actually i
34:23 - have somebody who could use your help
34:24 - with this or this other thing i'm like
34:25 - cool i got a job now
34:27 - that's the worst thing that can happen i
34:28 - think it's safer than a job
34:30 - because at a job they can let you go
34:34 - right a job it can be and then what you
34:37 - have to start
34:37 - all over again then be dependent on
34:39 - somebody again depending on somebody's
34:41 - financial
34:41 - so that's the part that i want you guys
34:44 - to understand
34:44 - but i want to i really want to go the
34:48 - opposite route of every other guru
34:50 - that's out there that's talking about
34:51 - youtube that's talking about these
34:53 - things
34:53 - i want to go the route of opposite of
34:55 - like making it sound easy i want to go
34:57 - the opposite of making it sound like
34:59 - something that
35:00 - every single person can just get and it
35:02 - will happen
35:04 - i want you to understand the amount of
35:07 - work that it requires because what i
35:09 - believe about everybody here is that
35:11 - none of you is lazy
35:12 - what i believe is every single person
35:14 - that's here is looking
35:16 - to execute every single person that's
35:18 - here is hungry and ambitious and driven
35:21 - nobody at a friday 11 50 a.m
35:25 - is on a zoom call with some weird dude
35:28 - with purple headsets listening and

37:25 - yeah i can't my bad here we go here we
37:27 - go so this is your channel right ronald
37:29 - yes okay so your
37:33 - thing here i already know that you're a
37:35 - great speaker
37:37 - just by actually listening to you on
37:39 - this call
37:40 - the reason why you're right now your
37:42 - problem is
37:43 - packaging so the main problem why it's
37:46 - not actually getting found is
37:48 - thumbnail and title so for example a lot
37:51 - of your videos
37:53 - the title is like may 16 2019. nobody's
37:56 - gonna
37:57 - type that in for it to come up also if i
37:59 - see it i don't know what's in the video
38:01 - so i won't click on it
38:03 - okay so that is one big thing and also
38:06 - the thumbnail so
38:08 - you know like for example each of these
38:11 - titles
38:12 - like this is a better title two masters
38:14 - lucifer wages war
38:16 - this is like a little bit better than
38:18 - something that has that's my book
38:20 - that's the book i wrote cool that's cool
38:22 - now ronald here's something else i want
38:24 - to tell you
38:26 - um nobody knows
38:29 - what you do and what your book is
38:32 - or cares about your book what they care
38:35 - about
38:36 - is the message so for example i have a
38:38 - product that i think is the best in the
38:40 - world
38:40 - but if i literally made a video with
38:43 - that product i
38:44 - do believe that i have the best product
38:45 - one of the best products in the world
38:47 - the problem that happens is nobody else
38:49 - knows that product
38:51 - so i'll say something and it'll be like
38:53 - oh what the hell like why is nobody
38:54 - caring
38:55 - but i won't that video is not gonna get
38:57 - any views and no but none of you guys is
38:59 - gonna watch
39:00 - it the reason why you guys are even here
39:02 - is
39:03 - i'm not even talking that much about
39:04 - myself like some of you guys probably
39:06 - don't even know
39:07 - how my name is spelled right and that's
39:09 - okay
39:10 - would you right like that's that's
39:13 - totally fine
39:14 - the main thing is while you're even here
39:16 - ronald and
39:17 - other people here is i'm directly
39:19 - addressing you totally forgetting about
39:21 - myself
39:22 - and just addressing what your pain point
39:24 - is what your concern what your problem
39:26 - is
39:27 - right now on this youtube why it's not
39:29 - going out to a lot of people
39:31 - is it's it's made for people who already
39:34 - know
39:35 - all this stuff which you know which is
39:36 - probably you and a few other people that
39:39 - listen to you in real life the other
39:41 - people who don't know your stuff it's
39:43 - really hard for them to find you
39:46 - the best advice i can give you is find
39:49 - somebody else
39:50 - who's similar to what you're doing who's
39:53 - also giving sermons
39:55 - but they're blowing up and they're
39:58 - getting a lot of views and you want to
40:01 - model your channel after them was eric
40:04 - thomas doing sermons at some point like
40:06 - eric thomas the person who does a lot of
40:08 - motivation
40:10 - like he had he had a huge channel
40:13 - um i mean he's here every night
40:17 - right yeah he i don't know if he did
40:21 - sermons ever but i know there are a few
40:23 - people who are like he did right at some
40:25 - point
40:26 - so you don't have to make your
40:28 - thumbnails this
40:29 - fancy like you could have like this
40:32 - right like secrets to success
40:35 - nothing funny this is not him doing
40:36 - sermons but basically he's
40:38 - speaking giving valuable advice so you
40:40 - can model a lot of things out of this
40:42 - so i would try to find people
40:46 - you enjoy ronald
40:49 - keep going with your messaging but
40:51 - thumbnail and title is the most
40:52 - important thing if you change that i
40:54 - believe your channel can grow
40:57 - okay second thing when you go ahead go
41:01 - ahead when you say thumbnail
41:02 - thumbnail what is that oh okay so
41:04 - thumbnail is
41:06 - this thing right here like your book
41:07 - cover it's like your book cover exactly
41:10 - so it's this thing
41:14 - is the image for every video but
41:16 - basically yeah
41:17 - so this over here like this cover right
41:20 - here is
41:20 - the thumbnail for this video this cover
41:23 - right here is a thumbnail for this video
41:25 - all right so your whatever you're
41:28 - covering you're talking about the
41:29 - picture of the picture of the picture
41:31 - that i put up yeah for the video yes the
41:33 - picture that you put up for the video
41:35 - correct
41:38 - yep so that is gonna be your that's your
41:41 - thumbnail
41:42 - so if you have a thumbnail that's maybe
41:44 - like a closer even a closer up of your
41:46 - face
41:47 - that is pretty good uh something where
41:50 - we can see you or see you in the middle
41:52 - of you talking
41:53 - so it looks like you're talk like almost
41:54 - like this right like this thumbnail is
41:56 - quit lying about your grind and if i
41:59 - look at this
42:00 - picture right here i can see that he's
42:02 - in the middle of
42:03 - talking or saying something i can look
42:06 - at this
42:07 - picture and the words underneath it and
42:09 - i'm like okay this video he's gonna like
42:11 - talk about quit lying about your grind
42:13 - it's gonna be something about passion i
42:15 - already know what it is before clicking
42:17 - into it
42:18 - so the problem that's happening with you
42:20 - is there's probably valuable content
42:22 - that you have
42:23 - but you're not giving me enough reason
42:24 - to click on it
42:26 - so okay that's the most important thing
42:29 - okay
42:30 - okay yeah and totally
42:34 - random and left field um if you started
42:38 - putting out your content
42:39 - on like if you you can even get
42:42 - somebody's help
42:43 - but if you put all your content on tick
42:45 - tock i actually believe you would grow
42:47 - like crazy
42:49 - i have a tic tac account yes i believe
42:52 - if you put out your content
42:53 - on tick tock you can point those people
42:56 - to your youtube but like
42:57 - if you just put out your advice your
42:59 - biggest thing is you want to get your
43:00 - message out to as many people as
43:02 - possible
43:02 - right yes yes so then
43:06 - i'm not religious about what platform it
43:08 - happens with
43:09 - the only thing i like about youtube is
43:11 - that's eventually where people go
43:12 - to go deeply and listen to you like in
43:16 - long form so they can truly hear your
43:18 - message
43:19 - so youtube of course like you should
43:21 - have but i believe that if you
43:23 - had a tick tock and you put out messages
43:26 - there that are 50 or 60 seconds
43:28 - small enough to be for people to consume
43:29 - and hear it
43:31 - it keeps going out to a lot of people
43:33 - and it'll get you really
43:35 - like known and then people will start
43:36 - watching your youtube more too
43:38 - okay so i actually would really release
43:41 - uh yeah i believe that
43:44 - i see okay go for a gilberto
43:48 - yeah and how do you overcome the fear
43:52 - of talking to the camera i mean
43:55 - i'm doing it but it feels a little bit
43:58 - tricky sometimes or uh let me ask you
44:01 - something
44:01 - was there any other thing in your life
44:03 - can you give me one thing in your life
44:05 - that you were at one point scared of and
44:06 - then you overcame it
44:09 - yeah almost everything i think okay so
44:12 - give me one specific thing
44:14 - running what scared you about running
44:19 - running 10k a race of 10k whoa
44:23 - nice that's awesome dude i i
44:26 - i was i wasn't sure if i can do it
44:30 - and then i prepare and that's awesome

44:33 - everybody everybody give them a round of
44:35 - applause that's huge so congratulations
44:37 - this is awesome excuse me whoo it's
44:40 - nothing to be
44:41 - scared of man thank you thank you so how
44:43 - did you overcome the fear of it and and
44:45 - then you did it
44:47 - i don't know i just push push myself i
44:50 - think
44:52 - can you do the same thing you think for
44:54 - making videos
44:57 - yeah i'm doing it but my question if
45:00 - is if you know some way
45:04 - to to get better to overcome that fear
45:08 - do you want the painful answer or you
45:10 - want the sugar-coated answer
45:12 - yeah yeah
45:19 - it's it's just painful like
45:21 - there's no secret way
45:22 - there's no secret okay okay thank you
45:25 - i will i would love i would love to sell
45:28 - you something for ten thousand dollars
45:30 - where i can help you overcome
45:32 - your fear but unfortunately like as much
45:34 - as you
45:35 - want to believe that there's something
45:36 - you just overcome like this or
45:38 - there's just nothing the best advice i
45:40 - can give you
45:42 - is just looking at the camera and doing
45:44 - it
45:46 - okay okay again and again and again
45:49 - and again and again and again so like
45:51 - let me can i ask a question
45:54 - uh yes go ahead claro
45:57 - um so like i'm struggling with what the
45:59 - content that i want to
46:01 - like make my youtube channel about and
46:03 - because i'm a beginner
46:05 - like coder yeah um i was thinking maybe
46:08 - like
46:09 - learn with me or something so like i'm
46:11 - kind of struggling just getting
46:12 - started got it ah okay so what is
46:16 - something
46:17 - what is something that you're so i see
46:19 - what your pro right your problem right
46:21 - now is hey i'm a beginner coder what do
46:23 - i make my content about
46:26 - yeah journey what is that what i kind of
46:29 - wanted to do i had the idea
46:30 - to do like learn with me or watch me
46:33 - struggle
46:34 - uh something like that like and maybe
46:36 - i'll be helping somebody else in the
46:38 - long run but like
46:39 - that's the idea that i have yeah but i
46:41 - don't know like how to start
46:44 - right so okay so a few things i want to
46:47 - share with you there okay so that's
46:49 - brilliant i love that you're already

46:51 - thinking about how you want to get
46:52 - started
46:53 - so that's huge so congratulations on
46:55 - that
46:56 - now the important thing that i want to
46:58 - mention here is
47:00 - for you to get started on your journey
47:03 - to making content
47:05 - the first thing is you have to
47:08 - there's always going to be like so many
47:10 - different options
47:12 - options lead to paralysis
47:15 - right like sometimes if i go to like a
47:18 - restaurant and they're like
47:20 - i'm like what do you recommend and
47:21 - they're like i recommend you get the
47:23 - grill skirt steak oh i also recommend
47:25 - you get the roasted mary's chicken
47:26 - oh by the way we have this other thing
47:28 - i'm like please just stop talking i'm
47:30 - like
47:32 - like i just like i feel the pain you
47:35 - know i'm like oh my god so many good
47:36 - options now i'm in just pain and i can't
47:38 - appreciate
47:39 - even one thing right so
47:43 - one i need a second opinion exactly
47:46 - yep yeah so one thing is
47:50 - i want you to at some point you know
47:53 - pick one thing
47:54 - and just do it it will allow you like
47:56 - you will
47:57 - start seeing a lot more as you start
47:59 - actually moving forward i think of it
48:00 - like driving a car
48:03 - you can't prepare for all the turns and
48:05 - adjustments you're going to make
48:06 - ahead of time right like you guys don't
48:10 - before you leave whoa is that an actual
48:12 - snake
48:14 - oh yeah actually actually i see
48:18 - the very first videos that i watched
48:21 - from you
48:22 - was what that's a thumbnail bruh oh
48:25 - python videos
48:26 - as soon as i started programming on
48:28 - python i decided to just get my bold
48:32 - python
48:35 - [Applause]
48:38 - oh my god do you let your clients touch
48:41 - your python
48:42 - yeah that's a sexual harassment training
48:45 - just waiting to happen
48:49 - [Laughter]
48:58 - that's one of my best things i have
49:00 - inspired somebody to do i love
49:02 - that kayla kayla says that's real
49:05 - commitment yeah i thank you you could
49:08 - get viral with this thing okay
49:11 - i love it clara um i don't want to miss
49:14 - your question
49:15 - so um when it comes to making your
49:18 - content one
49:19 - one thing we have to just pick now the
49:21 - second thing is you're torn and i can
49:23 - feel the pain between this thing or that
49:25 - thing
49:27 - for me when i when i started learning
49:29 - coding is when i started making my
49:31 - videos okay so
49:32 - the best thing to study from is like
49:35 - not even what i'm saying but what i've
49:37 - done and what other people have done
49:39 - oftentimes that is way more valuable and
49:42 - truthful than
49:43 - the words coming out of somebody's mouth
49:45 - because like even if i don't want to be
49:46 - maybe i can be wrong or forget something
49:48 - right i'm human being
49:50 - but if you just go look at what i
49:51 - actually did
49:53 - you'll see the real answer so i'll give
49:55 - you an example let's take a look at this
49:58 - video
49:59 - okay um we've all heard the stories
50:03 - about personal data being sold why do i
50:06 - have ads i
50:06 - pay for not having ads okay all right
50:10 - so this video here right
50:15 - um clara have you learned what a for
50:17 - loop is in programming
50:20 - no i'm basically i'm learning javascript
50:23 - right now i
50:24 - i've learned html and kind of
50:27 - familiar with css so i'm truly a
50:30 - beginner
50:30 - okay the example i'll give you is in
50:32 - this one um i was learning a programming
50:35 - like how you're learning a language
50:37 - called javascript right i was learning a
50:39 - language called
50:40 - r at the time okay okay
50:43 - i was a beginner in this and i was
50:46 - solving a
50:46 - problem like it was just like a problem
50:49 - and i was like you know what i can solve
50:50 - it on my own and just do it
50:52 - but what if i just like explained how i
50:54 - solved it and just put it up on youtube
50:58 - do you guys see that i didn't even know
51:00 - how to make it a full screen you guys
51:01 - see how like
51:02 - this much of the screen is like not even
51:03 - used because i i literally did not
51:05 - you make something full screen on
51:07 - youtube
51:09 - right and i posted this video
51:12 - another thing i want you guys to tell me
51:15 - is
51:16 - i call the video r programming week two
51:19 - assignment
51:20 - one pollutant mean walk through part one
51:22 - you think i knew how to title videos
51:24 - back then
51:26 - no maybe not no not really oh
51:30 - i think you should have got a python
51:32 - yeah
51:35 - absolutely not i didn't know how to
51:37 - title videos right and
51:38 - i wasn't even trying to get views on
51:40 - this video i just thought i will do a
51:43 - random thing
51:44 - and it might be helpful to somebody else
51:46 - my only
51:47 - methodology that i operate with is i
51:49 - call it just one
51:52 - right how many viewers do i need for me
51:54 - to feel happy
51:56 - how many just one that's one how many
51:59 - subscribers
52:00 - how many subscribers do i need to feel
52:02 - fulfilled
52:03 - just one just one right how many people
52:07 - need to watch this video
52:09 - for them to change their life
52:12 - just one just one right i just need one
52:15 - person's life to be changed
52:16 - so you guys see how that makes
52:18 - everything so easy to do
52:20 - so easy right i just need one older me
52:23 - to watch it and get some amount of value
52:26 - so like when i solve this problem i'm
52:28 - like literally
52:29 - a younger me might come through this
52:32 - and if they see it solved it will help
52:34 - them that's it right
52:35 - i just solved the problem i put up
52:37 - online i didn't expect for it to get 50
52:40 - 000 views i didn't expect for it to do
52:44 - this is so helpful blah blah blah
52:46 - there's like um
52:47 - there's a student that says i'm a phd
52:50 - student trying to get my head around it
52:52 - this is a great resource
52:53 - i was a complete beginner and apparently
52:55 - i'm helping a phd
52:58 - wow so something beautiful happens
53:02 - when like look at this right oh man this
53:03 - is super helpful i'm very frustrated by
53:05 - the week two assignment
53:06 - as i did not know how to do that i've
53:08 - been using blah blah blah for two plus
53:10 - years
53:11 - something else for six months started

56:20 - somebody else directly
56:22 - how many times you have to do multiple
56:24 - takes when you're speaking to a person
56:25 - you guys go ah
56:27 - i didn't mean to say that i'm so sorry
56:28 - cut let me say that again
56:30 - does that happen
56:33 - right so how many of us how many of us
56:36 - can have a conversation in one take
56:38 - how many of us can have a conversation
56:39 - in one take raise your hands
56:41 - everyone yeah how pretty she is
56:44 - right so if you can have a conversation
56:46 - in one if you can have a conversation
56:49 - in one take i like that joke by the way
56:51 - david so if you can have a conversation
56:53 - in one take with a person in real life
56:57 - well then you can do the same thing in a
57:00 - video
57:01 - okay you can do the exact same same
57:03 - thing in a video i see olivia just going
57:06 - crazy we need to give her some music in
57:07 - the back
57:08 - and we can go crazy with her
57:12 - um i love the music in her videos i get
57:15 - going i'm like
57:19 - i lost my mind yesterday so much fun
57:23 - so so for me my videos were
57:27 - were like i want to do them in a way
57:28 - where i only have to do one take
57:31 - and just speak the whole thing is i just
57:33 - planned out what i was going to talk
57:34 - about ahead of time and if it's your
57:36 - truth you don't have to make up
57:37 - it's just your truth
57:39 - right like ronald doesn't have to think
57:41 - about
57:42 - how does this how do i have to be how do
57:44 - i do a sermon like
57:46 - he doesn't have to be like how do i what
57:49 - words do i need to say to make it sound
57:51 - like i'm doing a sermon
57:52 - he actually does them so all he needs is
57:55 - somebody to record them and package them
57:58 - nicely and that's it
57:59 - like so for us if you're doing it on
58:01 - your truths you don't need to do
58:03 - eight different takes you know you can
58:06 - just
58:06 - actually talk about it and and share
58:08 - your experience or insight or the video
58:12 - um now i'm not making you shy away from
58:15 - learning editing because i think it's a
58:16 - good thing
58:18 - to enjoy it and be able to tell your
58:20 - story i think it's
58:21 - awesome to actually learn it but it's
58:24 - not something if you have limited time
58:26 - you can totally do a video in one take
58:28 - and then so
58:29 - all of my videos um and this is
58:32 - something i even do to this day
58:34 - i don't do that thing where i'm like i
58:35 - need to post one a day i'm not religious
58:37 - to posting one a day
58:39 - i just do it and i hit publish i do
58:41 - another one i hit publish i do another
58:43 - one i hit publish
58:44 - i don't like cue them i don't like
58:47 - schedule them
58:48 - i don't try to do 30 videos and then i'm
58:51 - gonna release one at a time i just do
58:52 - them and i hit publish so
58:54 - if you look at my channel there's there
58:57 - never has been any consistency in my
58:59 - channel
59:00 - but i don't i don't care some some weeks
59:02 - i make eight videos
59:04 - in 10 videos some weeks i make zero the
59:06 - other weeks i make 12.
59:07 - it doesn't matter i just keep going uh
59:10 - quasi i have a question
59:12 - um okay a lot of people are raising
59:15 - their hands i just started noticing so i
59:17 - don't know how many people were raising
59:18 - their hands so i'm gonna
59:20 - uh address them and then i'll come to
59:22 - you is it iona
59:24 - ionak yes you got it right okay
59:27 - i appreciate the the value you've been
59:28 - giving away so far
59:30 - thank you brother i appreciate you
59:31 - saying that i really do appreciate that
59:33 - thank you
59:33 - um let's go uh julio
59:37 - i i wonder if i'm saying your name right
59:39 - bro i always say julio i hope it's right
59:41 - yeah close close julio julio okay got it
59:45 - all right i mean you already touched
59:47 - upon uh
59:48 - the the points my question also before
59:50 - uh before i answer my question i don't
59:52 - know if gilberto is still here but uh
59:54 - i kind of have a suggestion that i
59:55 - started thinking about that
59:57 - made everything easier when it comes to
60:02 - yeah yeah so yeah uh one thing that i
60:05 - realized that
60:06 - made it much easier for me to start
60:08 - posting was
60:10 - don't talk to your entire audience
60:12 - you're not talking to everyone trying to
60:13 - beat everyone and trying to make sure
60:15 - that everyone likes you just choose a
60:16 - couple of friends that you know will
60:18 - enjoy your content
60:21 - right when you do that now you're
60:22 - pleasing just a handful of people much
60:24 - easier for you to say okay
60:25 - i know that they will like what i'm
60:26 - going to say that makes you feel good
60:29 - and just consider the rest of the
60:30 - audience just people that are spectating
60:32 - and if they don't like you
60:33 - oh that's money let me play some sounds
60:36 - for that say that
60:37 - for the comments that i received
60:40 - in one video or in one of my videos
60:44 - no wait no what i don't know nothing
60:46 - nothing nothing
60:47 - for your question before you were saying
60:49 - the fear how to overcome the fear of
60:51 - talking to the guy yeah
60:52 - yeah yeah so what what he's saying is
60:55 - imagine like you're talking like
60:57 - gilberta you have
60:58 - you have friends yes yes okay good
61:01 - thumb what's name your one friend that's
61:04 - a good friend
61:05 - andres andres okay when you look at the
61:08 - camera
61:09 - when you speak to andres how do you feel
61:13 - normal normal right now so when you look
61:15 - at the camera
61:17 - i want you to look at the camera like
61:18 - you're looking at andres
61:20 - [Music]
61:22 - okay so speak to that one person
61:27 - that's what he's saying that's what
61:28 - julia is saying to you ah
61:30 - okay i get it i get it oh thank you
61:32 - thank you very much
61:34 - that is actually money that advice is
61:36 - actually really money but you
61:38 - you have to actually like you can even
61:40 - say it like andres let me actually
61:42 - let me say that back and then go and say
61:44 - it like actually like you're talking to
61:45 - him
61:46 - my first youtube video my first one
61:49 - is actually made for one person so i
61:52 - wasn't even trying to play games i was
61:53 - literally trying to help a person do
61:55 - their coursera assignment
61:56 - and i'm even saying his name in the
61:58 - video that has 50 000 views right now
62:00 - like i'm actually saying his name
62:02 - so if it helps you can even say the
62:03 - person's name you're talking to
62:05 - and just let other people be confused
62:06 - when they're watching the video
62:10 - i'm not on grace all right so going back
62:14 - to my question but
62:15 - i'm glad that that might help um so my
62:18 - question is
62:19 - do you have a specific so there's
62:22 - there's a difference between like when
62:23 - you're doing one take you're going in
62:25 - free flow right so you're just talking
62:26 - to the camera you're not really
62:27 - scripting anything
62:28 - um and you mentioned that sometimes you
62:30 - do prepare right so that preparation
62:32 - phase
62:33 - yeah do you have a specific structure
62:35 - that makes it easy so that you can
62:36 - follow some bullet points without
62:37 - scripting it too much
62:39 - yes yes yes yes 100 uh let me actually
62:42 - see
62:42 - if um i can
62:46 - pull up uh
62:49 - yeah okay give me one second i let me
62:51 - see if i can actually
62:52 - pull up something that i can actually
62:54 - show you okay
62:57 - so let's go here
63:04 - so i'll give you an example okay so this
63:07 - is what it actually looks like
63:08 - so here's a video i wanted to do about
63:10 - like
63:12 - uh i wanted to do this series which i
63:14 - actually should do which was pretty cool
63:16 - and it was a series i was doing on
63:18 - billionaire developers
63:20 - so like mark zuckerberg uh steve jobs
63:23 - those people
63:25 - and i had a lot of like really dense
63:27 - concepts that i wanted to share like it
63:29 - dense thoughts not just something you
63:30 - can just sit there and just chat
63:32 - like dense because i was like going
63:34 - deep into some of these books and i was
63:36 - pulling out facts and i was using that
63:38 - to construct my video
63:39 - and construct solid arguments so for
63:42 - that
63:43 - i was writing down bullet points so like
63:45 - here
63:47 - you'll see like best developers
63:49 - outperform average developers not by 10x
63:51 - or 100x by what but
63:52 - by 1000x and i wanted to
63:56 - quote this part and it was from a book
63:57 - called uh i think the book is called
63:59 - essentialism or something like that
64:01 - right so that um
64:04 - i wanted to reference deep work by cal
64:07 - newport so i made sure i wrote that
64:09 - i wanted to talk about the salary of
64:11 - developers making over 100
64:12 - 100 000 so
64:15 - i wrote i first just wrote out all
64:18 - bullet points
64:19 - okay then i came up with like what this
64:22 - video will be called i came up with like
64:24 - 10 or 15 different titles
64:27 - all right so like average developers
64:29 - versus 1000 x developers and i was like
64:31 - but i kept going i didn't judge myself
64:33 - so and then i wrote ultra high
64:35 - performing
64:35 - like with this title right i liked it
64:37 - but it was kind of like
64:38 - eh like nobody's really looking for this
64:42 - title
64:43 - then i wrote ultra high performing
64:44 - developer and like like that's
64:46 - pretty kind of unclear then i was like
64:48 - how to become a 1000x developer
64:51 - yeah like kind of cool power of deep
64:54 - work for developers
64:56 - this was okay i kept going i kept going
64:59 - kept going
65:00 - and the last one i came to was how
65:02 - billionaire developers think
65:04 - decoding the mind of billionaire
65:06 - developers what do you guys think about
65:07 - that title
65:08 - that's good that's a good one right
65:10 - actually i was watching the video
65:12 - yesterday
65:14 - right so like even if you're not a
65:16 - developer you click on it so
65:18 - packaging here's a here's the
65:20 - unfortunate truth but a fortunate truth
65:22 - if you learn it
65:23 - guys you can have the best video on the
65:26 - planet but unfortunately
65:28 - that this one part is actually
65:31 - one million percent more important than
65:33 - what you're actually what you actually
65:34 - say in the video
65:36 - because if i don't click on your video
65:38 - it doesn't matter like
65:39 - it literally doesn't matter what you say
65:41 - in the video it's almost like you don't
65:43 - exist or your content doesn't exist
65:46 - and then this is where it gets advanced
65:49 - julio and
65:50 - you know i i try not to go too much this
65:53 - route because people are like i need
65:54 - this like i need million bullet points
65:56 - and i need to
65:57 - but then what i do is i will
66:01 - and i don't always do this again guys so
66:03 - like to be completely honest
66:05 - out of the 2000 videos i've made there's
66:08 - probably like
66:08 - seven or nine that i've truly truly
66:11 - scripted out okay so i want to make that
66:12 - clear
66:14 - all right like truly scripted out then
66:16 - what i did for this video is i
66:18 - took those bullet points and then i
66:20 - turned them into a script
66:22 - right so like i i wanted my hook to be
66:25 - strong so
66:26 - my hook i was like what if my hook is
66:27 - like bill gates
66:29 - mark zuckerberg ron jeremy what do they
66:31 - all have in common
66:33 - a huge ego just kidding
66:36 - and then i'm like two-thirds of them are
66:38 - ultra high performing developers and
66:40 - you see what i'm saying so like a little
66:41 - joke in the start solid hook
66:44 - and then i get into the video
66:50 - um
66:52 - [Music]
66:53 - so other than that
66:56 - what i recommend for most people is just
66:58 - some bullet points and then just
67:00 - go i don't think you need a script you
67:03 - can have certain bullet points and then
67:04 - you can address them
67:05 - like i can imagine like when i watched
67:08 - olivia's video yesterday
67:09 - i can almost imagine i would be okay
67:11 - with watching her videos
67:12 - if she even had a notebook in her hand
67:15 - like
67:15 - without doing any editing or cutting and
67:18 - she
67:19 - like if she literally had a notebook in
67:20 - her hand and she had like five points
67:24 - and she looked at the point and she was
67:25 - like okay number one and then she just
67:27 - puts the notebook down and she's like
67:30 - i'm gonna talk about like mentality and
67:31 - why it's so important and then she keeps
67:33 - talking about talk about it
67:34 - picks up her notebook and looks at the
67:35 - bullet point number two
67:37 - and goes ah yes this is the second thing
67:39 - i wanna talk about and then she talks
67:40 - about it the beat drops
67:43 - i don't care i don't need her to even
67:45 - edit that
67:46 - but if she's going through really good
67:48 - content even if she has to look at it i
67:51 - that is pure gold so for me when it
67:53 - comes to scripting it's bullet points
67:59 - and and that that's good for me it's
68:01 - good enough
68:04 - for roasting yeah so i'm picturing
68:07 - i know that you you cut out the poses
68:10 - right uh
68:11 - and that also adds to the to the video
68:13 - itself so potentially like all i would
68:15 - have to do in case there's some very
68:16 - intensive subject that i want to discuss
68:18 - regarding the career of a ceo
68:20 - um maybe i can just look on the script
68:24 - read it jump back say it and cut that
68:27 - cut the part where i'm reading it
68:30 - you can you you can't you can you
68:32 - definitely
68:33 - if you want to have it scripted you
68:35 - definitely can do that
68:37 - um and cut yeah exactly and you can cut
68:39 - the part where you're reading it right
68:41 - but one important thing julia i want you
68:43 - or julie i'm sorry giulio
68:44 - one important thing julio julio giulio
68:46 - julia one important thing i want you to
68:48 - get out of this
68:49 - is don't lose the soul and i know you
68:51 - won't lose a soul in there you're too
68:53 -  charismatic and energetic and i
68:55 - love that about you
68:56 - but just make sure that you're not
68:59 - you're not putting the words on the
69:01 - pedestal put the feeling in the heart on
69:03 - a pedestal because that comes through
69:04 - the camera
69:05 - i can feel that when i'm talking do you
69:08 - guys feel my energy on the call
69:10 - you guys like feel something right
69:12 - absolutely
69:13 - yes if i had a if i had a random
69:16 - slideshow and i was just talking
69:18 - about the slideshow would you guys feel
69:20 - the same way
69:22 - yeah yeah obviously no right
69:25 - so that's the important part like you
69:28 - will you want to make sure that that
69:29 - feeling comes across and you want to put
69:31 - that on a pedestal so you may
69:33 - if you have to go off script i go off
69:35 - script so much you know
69:36 - if i'm like if i just have a bullet
69:38 - point and i talk about it and then i
69:39 - remember some other i just go
69:41 - i make sure i'm feeling it like i feel
69:44 - it in my heart
69:45 - it's a truth that resonates with me and
69:47 - then i go there
69:48 - hacks what's up
69:53 - say amen yeah yeah yeah yeah awesome
69:57 - so feel it so it's like the hack few
69:59 - hacks to feel it is
70:01 - if you get frustrated about something
70:03 - it's really hot it's really hard to not
70:05 - feel frustration you feel frustrated
70:06 - it's like one of those feelings you can
70:07 - feel very quickly
70:09 - those are hacks um harder things are
70:13 - feeling grateful about something
70:14 - but like rants and feeling frustrated it
70:18 - quickly gets you in your body
70:19 - and like you can you can experience what
70:21 - you're saying so i keep
70:22 - some bullet points and then i go and
70:24 - then if i feel them
70:26 - the better the video gets i like that
70:29 - all right so
70:30 - now the reason why i like scripting at
70:31 - least a little bit because my
70:33 - my feeling part like my brainstorming
70:35 - mode my free flow
70:37 - talks in very long sentences ah i see
70:39 - okay very very precise so
70:41 - um but i really really appreciate that
70:44 - yep cool
70:45 - got it got it yeah so you can have a
70:46 - bullet point and then go through them
70:49 - and then they'll keep you on track most
70:50 - of the times you know that's what i
70:51 - actually like about that that's why i
70:53 - actually really like
70:54 - slide shows like making like making
70:57 - google slides
70:59 - so it keeps me talking
71:02 - and doesn't give me a script i just have
71:04 - images so like i'll put 20 images of
71:06 - what i want to talk about
71:08 - and that keeps me on track without even
71:10 - needing a script
71:12 - and it's visually cool for you guys
71:13 - because you get to see like what we're
71:15 - talking about now
71:16 - so yeah little cues for yourself would
71:19 - be great and it keeps you on track the
71:20 - whole time
71:21 - and then you can just like boom move to
71:22 - the next part um as soon as
71:24 - i feel like the value is not there
71:26 - anymore i
71:27 - very quickly will move to the next point
71:29 - that's valuable
71:31 - i have like this crazy value radar
71:34 - that's just like
71:36 - like value value like and then as soon
71:38 - as i start detecting this is not
71:40 - value it's kind of like what it sounds
71:42 - like in my head is
71:43 - you guys know like those new cars now
71:45 - when you're like backing out
71:47 - if there's something around you'll be
71:48 - like right or when you're turning and
71:50 - like beep like crazy and it gives you
71:52 - anxiety you're like what the hell like
71:53 - what's happening i'm not even close to
71:54 - anybody
71:55 - so like that starts going in my head as
71:59 - soon as
72:00 - i'm getting away from the value i think
72:02 - that has come
72:03 - from uploading 490 plus videos on just
72:06 - one youtube channel
72:07 - plus probably doing over like 500 lives
72:10 - um countless coaching calls so i have
72:12 - like probably over 1000 to 2000 like
72:16 - videos of me like speaking
72:19 - so over time i just developed like this
72:21 - really
72:22 - strong sense and as soon as i feel like
72:25 - i'm on tangents
72:26 - i go back but it's a
72:29 - dangerous area because you i also want
72:32 - you to be in your heart and not too much
72:33 - in your head
72:35 - so micro improvements every video
72:39 - don't over judge yourself
72:42 - but you'll improve over a quantity like
72:44 - long period of time think about like
72:46 - developing a skill like guitar or
72:48 - skateboarding or
72:49 - biking or whatever it will take a lot of
72:51 - repetitions
72:52 - i believe that you can't get quality
72:56 - uh without doing quantity so just do a
72:59 - lot of it
73:00 - and do what you're feeling with the
73:01 - script and i think you will get so good
73:03 - at it bro
73:05 - uh hi kazi would you would you like to
73:08 - review my youtube channel
73:09 - uh it has like five six videos do you
73:12 - have one minute time to see
73:13 - who is this uh i'm sure okay we went
73:17 - over you so give me one second
73:18 - i wanna address i'm gonna go with stacy
73:21 - and a few others and then maybe at some
73:22 - point i'll do the
73:23 - roasting of the youtube channels or

73:44 - help me spotlight oh
73:46 - awesome thank you somebody's helping
73:47 - with that beautiful go ahead
73:50 - so i guess my question was um
73:53 - since this is about the making that of
73:55 - that one thousand dollars
73:57 - i wanted to maybe get some insight on
74:00 - whether or not you got your first 1000
74:04 - just strictly from youtube or was it
74:06 - from
74:07 - other sources my first uh so okay that's
74:10 - a brilliant question
74:11 - thank you for that so let's go and look
74:14 - at the truth
74:15 - i love just looking at the actual truth
74:18 - so
74:18 - i want to go here you guys can see that
74:22 - let me go i think january so this is
74:25 - where i did
74:26 - something i'm going gonna share with you
74:27 - guys in a second we're gonna get a
74:28 - little bit advanced is that okay if we
74:30 - get just a little bit advanced guys
74:32 - sure i try to yeah yes all right yeah
74:35 - that's fine
74:36 - i'm always like man i i don't wanna just
74:38 - everybody be like oh my god this is so
74:40 - crazy
74:41 - all right so um
74:44 - let's go to january
74:48 - all right so right at the start
74:51 - of jan i remember like new year's day
74:55 - what i decided to do was
74:58 - i sold a product
75:02 - i sold the product like i i came up with
75:04 - something and i'm like
75:06 - people are already following me for
75:08 - programming
75:10 - what if i had something on programming
75:12 - that maybe went deeper
75:13 - and gave more value but i could charge
75:16 - 47 bucks for it
75:18 - okay so i sold that thing
75:22 - that thing that day made me uh i think
75:24 - twelve hundred dollars
75:26 - whoa yeah okay so in one day
75:29 - yeah that was huge
75:33 - that was huge for me i was like oh my
75:36 - god i was losing my mind
75:38 - now that number is not twelve hundred
75:40 - dollars that number is a lot more
75:42 - but that those days it was it was that
75:44 - so that is how i broke my first one
75:46 - thousand
75:47 - subs uh one thousand dollars okay and
75:50 - remember we talked about there's 14 15
75:52 - different ways we can make an income
75:54 - stacy
75:55 - yes for me i recommend like
75:59 - making a channel on what you're good at
76:02 - or what you like wanna sh whatever it is
76:04 - that you're like providing specific
76:06 - value on and then maybe one day you can
76:08 - sell a course
76:11 - i think that's like a really good solid
76:13 - way to go about it
76:15 - um it doesn't and so for me that's what
76:18 - i did i decided to sell a course
76:20 - um and i that's how i broke my first
76:23 - thousand dollars
76:28 - okay um and this is the part
76:31 - what's up you can also do affiliate
76:35 - marketing
76:36 - yes i will click bank
76:40 - yes you can there's a lot of that stuff
76:42 - you guys can do
76:43 - just one thing with me guys everybody
76:46 - has their own ways of going about it for
76:48 - me
76:49 - i like to recommend build your own brand
76:52 - like build your own brand
76:55 - affiliate and stuff like there's so many
76:58 - ways to do it there's no
76:59 - but like for me it dilutes your brand
77:02 - and
77:02 - your message you end up sometimes like
77:05 - the la there's lack of
77:06 - trust because you're always trying to
77:07 - sell other people's product and then
77:08 - you're dependent on other people
77:10 - and so if those people decide to not be
77:12 - your affiliates anymore for whatever
77:14 - reason
77:15 - i believe in like make something
77:17 - valuable and then sell your own thing i
77:19 - think that's the best way to be the most
77:21 - profitable
77:25 - um what's your friends of income
77:29 - so i have a question when you have a
77:31 - moment uh okay one second so stacy
77:34 - does that help at all yeah definitely
77:37 - helps yeah i like that
77:39 - um that you you mentioned branding and i
77:42 - think that's very important is
77:44 - really um once you get that confidence
77:46 - about yourself and what
77:48 - what value you have to bring then that's
77:50 - when it
77:51 - really hits home that you can build your
77:54 - own brand
77:54 - yes i think that's good here's the
77:56 - here's the tricky part about
77:58 - the confidence
78:01 - um if you wait
78:05 - if you wait for permission to get that
78:07 - confidence
78:10 - most of these things will never become a
78:11 - reality
78:14 - that was one big difference between me
78:16 - and my close friends
78:18 - where we started out and then i built
78:21 - something
78:22 - and they didn't or they couldn't
78:26 - um so like here here's a crazy part
78:30 - right stacy
78:31 - if you don't have if you don't start
78:33 - trying to believe in yourself or like
78:35 - that i can do this or i'm gonna start
78:37 - working on it now
78:39 - you're not going to make those videos
78:40 - and you're not going to make them like
78:42 - with your heart
78:43 - as much because you're always like
78:44 - looking for permission they're like i
78:45 - don't have enough
78:46 - permission right now to uh be really
78:49 - confident my videos are like really
78:50 - deliver my all
78:52 - really deliver my value that's gonna
78:54 - make guys what is what's going on
78:56 - if we can just mute the weird sounds
79:00 - uh okay thank you i checked everyone
79:02 - somewhere okay
79:03 - cool so
79:06 - um so you have to
79:10 - almost be delusional a little bit
79:13 - and just decide to believe in yourself
79:16 - today
79:18 - okay see what i'm saying like
79:22 - is it okay if i just decided to believe
79:23 - in myself today
79:27 - is it okay is it okay with you stacy
79:30 - so yeah don't and that's good because
79:33 - yesterday when olivia
79:34 - talked and she was like super motivated
79:37 - and i was like yeah
79:38 - i can do this i'm gonna show my face so
79:41 - i hope you can look at my video and
79:44 - roast me if you have to
79:45 - yeah i think i did i showed my face this
79:47 - time okay
79:49 - perfect i love that i apprec that is
79:51 - amazing so
79:53 - self-esteem is such a big part of this
79:55 - game i want
79:59 - man uh i can get technical with this
80:02 - so okay i'll get a little technical with
80:04 - this so
80:05 - we have money right like let's say we
80:08 - let's say we want to make money so the
80:10 - closest
80:11 - thing to money is what what's one step
80:14 - that happens before
80:16 - i like if you wanted to build a brand or
80:18 - sell a course
80:19 - what's the thing that happens right
80:21 - before there's actually the money hits
80:23 - your bank account what's the step right
80:24 - before
80:26 - [Music]
80:27 - value value i i believe that there is
80:31 - something that's actually
80:32 - demanding closer than that you guys are
80:34 - going further
80:36 - product who said that uh kayla
80:39 - yep so product is the thing that comes
80:42 - right before you get money because you
80:45 - can't even if you wanted to pay me
80:47 - stacy you can't pay me if i don't have a
80:49 - product
80:50 - okay right what comes
80:54 - so like you literally cannot like if i
80:56 - have a product on a page you can pay me
80:58 - and buy the product or the service so
81:00 - that's what it is
81:01 - now what's the thing that comes right
81:03 - above the product right before the
81:04 - product what gets you to my product in
81:06 - the first place
81:09 - excitement excitement
81:13 - interest interest yep yeah
81:17 - so the youtube videos and the content
81:20 - is actually the thing that gets you to
81:22 - my product if you hadn't viewed my
81:24 - content you wouldn't get to
81:25 - the product if you don't get to the
81:27 - product you don't get to the money
81:31 - see what i'm saying so
81:34 - there's money right above money's
81:36 - product directly above money's product
81:38 - directly above product is content
81:40 - and what's above content
81:44 - this is where it gets tricky what's
81:46 - above content what's the thing that
81:47 - happens
81:48 - before content happens ideas
81:51 - ideas inspiration inspiration
81:56 - execution right just starting
82:00 - so i like to put i'd like to combine all
82:02 - of those things inspiration whatever
82:04 - all of those things right who are what
82:07 - is it the thing that brings inspiration
82:09 - what is the thing
82:12 - humans humans passion
82:15 - right like humans is the thing above
82:18 - content if you don't have
82:19 - human if you don't have a person or
82:21 - talent you're never to come up with
82:23 - those inspiration or the ideas or
82:25 - making content you see what i'm saying
82:28 - so
82:28 - all the way at the top is like you
82:31 - that's where everything flows from
82:33 - the human is the per the actual person
82:36 - comes up with the content then product
82:39 - happens and then money happens
82:42 - right the slowest and the hardest path
82:45 - the quickest path to getting to money is
82:46 - working on your product right this
82:48 - second
82:49 - right there's a quick like literally uh
82:51 - if gilberta is just like here's a
82:53 - product here's my link go buy this right
82:54 - now and he just drops it in the chat
82:56 - that's the
82:57 - shortest path to him making income he
82:59 - can get to see what i'm saying
83:01 - but it's very short term we'll very
83:04 - quickly probably tune them out
83:05 - maybe one person will buy it but like
83:06 - everybody else will just
83:08 - we're tuned out so
83:11 - product is the quickest thing to work on
83:13 - the thing that happens above
83:15 - it is content now it's harder because a
83:17 - slower path to getting money
83:19 - but it's a really powerful way to get to
83:22 - money
83:23 - right and the thing that's way harder
83:26 - than that and takes even longer
83:28 - is working on yourself working on the
83:32 - actual human the talent
83:35 - for me right now what that might what
83:37 - that means is hiring people and the
83:39 - actual
83:39 - training the people for you what that
83:43 - means is
83:43 - working on yourself working on your
83:46 - inner
83:47 - confidence working on your guys's
83:49 - self-esteem
83:50 - working on like the belief canceling the
83:54 - other noises that are stopping you from
83:56 - doing this
83:58 - the validation that you're looking for
84:01 - that you won't get ever you or you might
84:05 - get it like hundred thousand subscribers
84:07 - in but you're not gonna get to the
84:08 - hundred thousand or one thousand
84:09 - subscribers if you don't give it to
84:11 - yourself
84:11 - today okay right if people are waiting
84:15 - to get permission to make content when
84:18 - they
84:18 - like most people don't say this but they
84:21 - think this
84:23 - how many of you will how many of you
84:25 - have went to your youtube channel and
84:27 - tomorrow it had 100 000 subscribers how
84:28 - many of you will actually
84:30 - start taking youtube seriously and start
84:31 - making content raise your hands
84:34 - right if today you got to check for
84:37 - 20 000 for you like
84:41 - hey you should do youtube how many of
84:42 - you will start taking youtube seriously
84:44 - that's a real thing
84:48 - problem is you're waiting for that
84:51 - that's the problem that's why you're not
84:54 - doing it today
84:55 - that's good i i started my channel a
84:58 - couple of days ago when you
85:00 - start this journey and i have

86:56 - through email i'll try to share it
86:57 - through the text message
86:59 - and maybe even in the facebook group but
87:02 - facebook just does an
87:03 - awful job of letting people know that
87:05 - there's anything going on we have 3 700
87:07 - members
87:07 - and like only 40 show up to the facebook
87:09 - live calls like

87:14 - but i mean i just enjoy zoom so this is
87:17 - super cool i'm going to be doing a lot
87:18 - of this
87:19 - i'm going to set up a whole system

87:30 - you know the whole meeting id and
87:33 - everything actually came in like
87:34 - 15 minutes after 11 a.m um is there a
87:38 - way that we can
87:39 - have that meeting id and the passcode
87:41 - like before 11
87:42 - yes yes yes yes it's my fault that it
87:44 - happened after that because i just
87:46 - randomly came up with the idea and my
87:48 - team was like what the hell you're doing
87:49 - a zoom call now we have to change
87:50 - everything i'm like i want to talk with
87:52 - them i don't care let's figure it out
87:53 - guys
87:54 - so so sorry about that but tomorrow
87:57 - it'll it'll happen ahead of time
87:59 - okay and will we get that link through
88:01 - email
88:02 - uh you guys will get it through email
88:04 - and
88:05 - text uh if you guys join that texting
88:08 - platform like you if you guys sent the
88:09 - text when you guys join the channel yeah
88:12 - yeah so then it'll happen to your phone
88:13 - as well email and phone okay guys i'm
88:15 - gonna go into devon's question now
88:17 - all right devin go for it all right so
88:20 - based on what everyone's kind of been
88:21 - saying as far as
88:22 - finding the motivation or content like
88:25 - i've
88:26 - all those things are good but the main
88:29 - thing for me that i'm having trouble
88:31 - focusing on
88:31 - is well looking into the webcam for one
88:34 - and
88:34 - two uh the energy because
88:38 - when i'm talking to you on zoom or you
88:41 - know there's a group of people there's a
88:42 - certain energy
88:43 - and then when i'm recording by myself
88:45 - and it's just me in my room
88:47 - in silence you need to work okay you
88:50 - i'll tell you because i already know you
88:52 - um you need to work on becoming happier
89:00 - it's like
89:04 - once you like this is a hard thing to
89:07 - think about
89:08 - and this is a thing that's like oh
89:10 - like this is crazy
89:11 - but like i just want to go to the
89:13 - deepest thing because i already know you
89:15 - so i have rapport with you
89:18 - everything else is going to be temporary
89:20 - dude like literally every other solution
89:22 - is only going to be temporary
89:23 - like if you're going to be around me and
89:25 - this energy temporarily you're going to
89:26 - keep going up you're going to want to
89:28 - make content you're going to want to do
89:29 - this as soon as that energy goes away
89:30 - it's going to drop
89:32 - so like the and the best way
89:35 - to actually have that
89:38 - is be around people who are like sillier
89:42 - come off like stupid laugh a lot and
89:44 - have fun like
89:45 - get to that you have like a child in you
89:47 - and i know that
89:50 - right so you're very smart you're very
89:53 - deeply analytical you're very thoughtful
89:55 - but that can also lead to overthinking
89:57 - for you yes or no
89:59 - absolutely right sometimes instead of
90:02 - being in your body
90:03 - you're sometimes in your mind
90:07 - right also you have a child in you and i
90:10 - know that you can like laugh at the
90:11 - dumbest things and have fun
90:12 - yes or no yes so
90:16 - you need to like love that part more and
90:19 - feed that
90:20 - part more like it's a really weird
90:22 - answer
90:23 - because it's like has nothing to do with
90:25 - youtube analytics
90:26 - but like the more you actually feed that
90:28 - like even that part where you're
90:30 - laughing right now
90:31 - the more you make yourself happier the
90:33 - more you're going to want to do this
90:37 - so like tactical tips i can give you
90:41 - spend more time around people that are
90:42 - just like stupidly happy all the
90:44 - time
90:45 - where you're like you have no reason to
90:46 - be happy like you just got up
90:48 - today
90:48 - and they're like oh i know yeah like
90:51 - be around people who are just happy
90:54 - that's like
90:54 - the best thing i can share with you like
90:56 - actually spend time with them
90:58 - what's gonna happen is you're gonna
91:00 - start coming up
91:01 - and then at some point it's going to
91:02 - start becoming your normal
91:04 - happiness leads to just like the most
91:07 - insane amount of action
91:08 - like you can force yourself and use
91:11 - discipline
91:13 - but it's like temporary like you could
91:16 - brood for like you're gonna be angry you
91:18 - can punish yourself and be like what the
91:19 -  is wrong with me
91:20 - why am i not making videos there's
91:22 - something wrong with me come on
91:24 - you can yell at yourself all day
91:26 - temporary
91:28 - so i don't want you guys to get into
91:30 - that pattern it's a short-term pattern
91:32 - that works but it's like being in an
91:33 - abusive relationship
91:36 - you know it's like that person you found
91:38 - really attractive but they're
91:39 - awful people but you decide to get into
91:41 - it and then it's just like a nightmare
91:43 - getting out of it
91:44 - and it gets abusive so it's almost like
91:46 - i don't want you to develop that pattern
91:48 - or for people to develop that pattern of
91:50 - themselves where you just yell at
91:51 - yourself to do it because then
91:53 - you develop a bad relationship like even
91:56 - when shazada was here he was like i'm
91:57 - lazy
91:59 - that is gonna if he keeps saying that
92:01 - language
92:02 - you know he's like i'm lazy with making
92:03 - content i just need to force myself and
92:05 - push myself
92:06 - he's gonna actually start not enjoying
92:08 - making content
92:09 - because this is to be like trying to
92:11 - force himself to be disciplined
92:14 - he's going to start being his own
92:15 - disciplinarian dad
92:18 - which we all know what happens when you
92:19 - just have a purely discipline iranian
92:21 - father mother you start running away
92:24 - from them like as a little kid like for
92:26 - me
92:26 - when i had that sometimes i would start
92:29 - running away because i was like i don't
92:30 - want to deal with that
92:31 - you'll start running away from yourself
92:34 - so what's important is to
92:38 - like it's a weird answer
92:41 - but i really do believe it that like
92:45 - yes you can plan out like i know you
92:46 - don't have you don't have a problem with
92:48 - planning content right
92:50 - right you know even what to make it on
92:54 - do you know what i'm going to make after
92:55 - this call yeah so
92:58 - so i want you to pay attention to that
92:59 - you will make one after this call
93:01 - and latch on to that like that emotional
93:04 - when you get that emotional push
93:06 - when you feel your energy going up latch
93:09 - onto that
93:10 - like a hungry dog behind the meat truck
93:14 - so like make the actual video you take
93:17 - advantage of it
93:18 - but then what i want you to actually
93:21 - work on
93:22 - is like literally physically
93:25 - smile and laugh more throughout the day
93:27 - like literally
93:28 - you know how when you look at your phone
93:29 - and it says you use instagram for four
93:31 - hours today
93:33 - i want you to literally be able to sit
93:35 - down at the end of the day and be like
93:37 - for 47
93:38 - minutes i i couldn't stop
93:40 - laughing today hard
93:45 - like that much like where you can almost
93:48 - quantify the amount of
93:49 - time like how much happy you are if i go
93:52 - to sleep
93:53 - and it isn't a day where i laughed so
93:56 - hard that i had tears coming out of my
93:58 - eyes i'm like damn man i gotta
94:00 - work on happiness
94:01 - more like so
94:04 - really like be happy and do that like
94:07 - watch
94:07 - comedy watch stuff that you like what's
94:10 - gonna happen
94:11 - is while you're planning stuff out about
94:13 - making content another
94:14 - tangible hack is you can watch content
94:16 - about making content so like that's
94:18 - gonna excite you about making content
94:20 - the biggest thing is like overall
94:23 - raising your
94:24 - levels of happiness but being around
94:26 - happy people listening to happy things
94:29 - your level of like what you actually
94:31 - produce in your output will go
94:32 - way beyond like that's the actual
94:36 - solution to what you're looking for

94:43 - correct answer
94:44 - at the same time so i'm gonna

94:50 - interesting turn but yeah i'm definitely

102:42 - some point we're gonna start doing the
102:44 - youtube roast as well
102:46 - uh i have a question um hold on i saw
102:49 - i'm gonna go with frank right now
102:50 - because i saw his hand was raised frank
102:52 - go for it
102:53 - [Music]
102:54 - yeah no cause this uh this five-day
102:56 - series thing is amazing
102:57 - i got my i got my mic now so you guys
103:00 - can hear me a lot better
103:02 - um yeah putting out the intention is
103:04 - great i got the energy
103:06 - um i think i get stuck sometimes on like
103:08 - what is like
103:09 - what is something interesting some
103:11 - evergreen content right it's like i
103:12 - don't want to get in too much into the
103:14 - weeds
103:14 - so it's like you know you saw the one i
103:17 - saw previously was you know
103:18 - my e-commerce one like i know that space
103:20 - really well like i can teach that to
103:22 - anybody
103:23 - yeah um but i want to you know do
103:24 - something more evergreen that's like
103:27 - you know relevant with the times um i
103:29 - think that's
103:30 - kind of what i get stuck on sometimes
103:32 - okay cool
103:33 - so a few things here if it's evergreen
103:36 - it's by definition not gonna be relevant
103:38 - with time
103:41 - see what i'm saying trending
103:44 - right so it's like for example if you're
103:46 - doing something that's like
103:47 - right now trending or like meme worthy
103:49 - like it might be really good for
103:51 - now and it's a good way to do it but
103:53 - it's by definition not
103:54 - necessarily content is truly going to be
103:56 - like evergreen forever because it's like
103:58 - maybe just
103:59 - happening in the now okay so it's like
104:01 - imagine if you watched a video and it
104:02 - had like
104:03 - some meme song in there you know uh
104:06 - what's that harlem shake you guys
104:08 - remember when harlem shake was like a
104:09 - crazy thing
104:11 - right um and so if
104:14 - that like when you watch it today it's
104:16 - not evergreen it's like outdated
104:18 - like you can tell it's outdated but
104:19 - truly evergreen stuff there's content
104:21 - that people have made 10 years ago on
104:23 - youtube or
104:24 - they're maybe giving advice or valuable
104:26 - things that can be really really
104:28 - like potentially evergreen now and
104:30 - nothing is going to be like forever
104:31 - nothing is going to be like permanent
104:33 - but you know for example one of the
104:35 - videos that works always really well in
104:37 - the programming world this top five
104:38 - programming languages to learn
104:42 - you know okay yeah so like that could be
104:44 - your evergreen type of content if you
104:46 - want to do something along those lines
104:49 - right or like the top five programming
104:51 - roles
104:52 - like right like something like that that
104:55 - maybe i'll
104:55 - kind of go that direction too because i
104:57 - my gut feeling
104:59 - if you want to crush it on the developer
105:01 - level
105:02 - my gut feeling and this is something
105:03 - that i discovered and i had a hunch and
105:05 - then i told sunny about it and he jumped
105:07 - on it with me
105:09 - was those builds i deeply believed that
105:11 - it was going to be
105:12 - the most valuable thing and it turned
105:15 - out to be
105:15 - truly the most valuable thing they got
105:17 - countless people jobs
105:19 - countless people got jobs from it um
105:22 - you were one of the people that i
105:24 - believe leveraged it to get a higher
105:26 - paying job
105:27 - oh all the way like i'm probably the
105:29 - most successful
105:30 - like off that and it's like i really
105:33 - appreciate it
105:34 - tell everybody here where what job did
105:36 - you have like how much were you making
105:37 - before and then after
105:38 - those clones you watch those videos what
105:41 - was the new job that you got
105:43 - so um previous to the job i was
105:46 - making around 150 um and
105:49 - after doing the the build with sonos
105:52 - like the
105:52 - the guys who make these speakers really
105:54 - high-end speakers
105:56 - um i put it on the uh profitable
105:59 - javascript thing too
106:00 - i was able to get uh land 175 000
106:04 - job off of one of the clones that sunny
106:06 - came up with
106:07 - uh which was the spotify clone so
106:10 - amazing bro
106:11 - that's amazing and basically picked up
106:14 - react
106:15 - enough to do that and then i built a
106:17 - dashboard for them and then i'm also
106:19 - making their app
106:20 - because i'm i'm primarily a mobile app
106:22 - developer and i'm making that in react
106:24 - native
106:24 - so so here's one thing i just knew we
106:27 - were never gonna go wrong with
106:29 - if he can use our video to go from a
106:32 - hundred and fifty thousand dollar job to
106:34 - 170 000
106:35 - job do you guys would you guys say that
106:37 - we brought him value
106:39 - oh yeah right absolutely so yeah
106:42 - when there's something that i feel like
106:44 - is gonna truly bring value
106:46 - i just know that it's gonna crush like
106:48 - truly bring val so like
106:50 - in the developer world the ultimate hack
106:52 - is just bills
106:53 - there's a lot of other stuff but if you
106:56 - are good
106:57 - which you are dude i will just
106:59 - personally tell you go the route of
107:00 - builds
107:01 - you can do other stuff if you want and
107:03 - you're truly excited for but you're like
107:04 - yo i want the fastest path to like
107:06 - growth and success
107:08 - build build a tesla landing page
107:11 - build uh you know what i mean build like
107:14 - uh
107:15 - uh uber clone with react native build a
107:17 - spotify clone with react native like
107:20 - just like we were dropping like
107:22 - tick-tock uh we showed people how to
107:24 - make tick-tock
107:25 - right so that's trending it's hot and
107:28 - all of our developers wanted to learn it
107:30 - we showed people how to make tinder
107:33 - we showed people how to make um all of
107:35 - these like amazon
107:36 - like would any of you guys would be
107:38 - interested to even see like yo how do
107:40 - you actually make amazon in one day
107:42 - that's kind of cool right the amazon
107:43 - store i'm interested how do you do that
107:46 - yeah so like that's what we showed like
107:49 - we built
107:50 - all of these things because we're
107:51 - developers and then other people were
107:53 - able to build them so that
107:55 - stupid amount of value i knew that even
107:57 - if the videos weren't the best edited
107:59 - the best this the data i knew that that
108:02 - was just gonna
108:03 - dominate so as on the developer side if
108:06 - you go that route
108:07 - you're just gonna dominate and
108:08 - especially if you're good which you are
108:10 - oh bro it's time to fly and what
108:13 - i will even extend to you
108:15 - is if you want to make content like that
108:17 - we have a channel
108:18 - clever programmer with 830 thousand
108:20 - subscribers i would love
108:23 - for it to be even on there i'm totally
108:25 - down for that
108:26 - i'm totally down for that okay so like
108:29 - if you actually want to do it pick a
108:31 - build and we can build it
108:34 - yeah like i've been telling sunny like
108:35 - it would be amazing to have like a super
108:37 - build right
108:38 - everything from the react all the way to
108:42 - maybe some back ends some stuff
108:44 - yep all the way to the native
108:45 - like all the full stack and that would
108:47 - be amazing
108:48 - and that would be so like pick one thing
108:50 - like you know whatever you want to do it
108:51 - on spotify
108:53 - tick tock tinder whatever it is pick one
108:55 - thing
108:56 - do the video however long it is and then
108:59 - if i think
109:00 - instead of even doing a live you can do
109:01 - the video you can record it
109:03 - and then like just put that out i think
109:05 - that's gonna do really well and if you
109:07 - want we
109:07 - i'd be happy to put it down on our
109:09 - channel too because coding related 100
109:11 - yeah and and yeah all pre-recorded you
109:14 - know just because like some of what you
109:15 - were saying like
109:16 - for me doing it live is not not usually
109:18 - an option because of you know
109:20 - because i'm working on it yeah yeah um
109:22 - but um
109:24 - but the idea the idea is i want to
109:26 - provide something really good value
109:28 - yeah um i think i'm going to pick up
109:29 - that sony um blogger
109:31 - vlogger camera that you were talking
109:32 - about it's really handy awesome
109:35 - and uh yeah let's produce some content
109:36 - man i'm i'm totally down for that that
109:38 - would be sick
109:39 - that would be really really sick i'm so
109:41 - excited about that bro
109:43 - uh jump on it i think that's uh that's
109:45 - one of those opportunities that can be
109:47 - just truly
109:48 - life-changing uh it can give you a head
109:50 - start into you making content and
109:52 - helping people and our number one goal
109:54 - is always to
109:55 - like even in 2021 our number one goal is
109:57 - to help 5 000 developers get jobs
109:59 - and we document that every time they get
110:01 - jobs we document that
110:03 - and yeah and and getting mobile mobile
110:05 - development is a huge
110:07 - it's a huge thing too and a lot of
110:08 - people want to learn it i get
110:10 - questions like that all the time i'm
110:11 - like how do i become a mobile developer
110:13 - and stuff and
110:14 - i coach people and i talk to them like
110:15 - just for free right but
110:17 - it'd be good if i was like hey let me
110:18 - show you let me show you how to make
110:21 - instagram or show you how to make an
110:23 - uber app for real
110:24 - for yes beautiful beautiful i'm down man
110:27 - let's do it
110:29 - awesome awesome great so there
110:32 - um you know hopefully that give you guys
110:34 - something with like
110:35 - you know with insight into how to think
110:37 - about content like sometimes sometimes
110:40 - if you can find something that you
110:42 - deeply believe and know that it's
110:43 - valuable
110:44 - like truly valuable they could just use
110:46 - it man that is usually one of the best
110:49 - routes you can go
110:50 - like for example one of the best routes
110:52 - i can go is like
110:53 - share like even right now what i'm doing
110:55 - is is this
110:56 - right now what you're watching like is
110:58 - this edited
111:01 - is there cool music happening are there
111:03 - cuts
111:05 - is there anything that's fancy about
111:07 - this
111:09 - yet why are you still here we've been
111:12 - here for two hours and
111:14 - a close to two hours and eight minutes
111:15 - why are we here
111:17 - why are you still here wow excuse me
111:21 - because we have a passion for it and we
111:23 - want to learn and we want to just absorb
111:25 - what we can
111:26 - yes you have a commitment to absorb
111:30 - you have a passion and then now there's
111:31 - value for you right that's why you're
111:33 - like you're staying here because you're
111:34 - getting value right people
111:36 - if you're not you don't care about
111:38 - anything except like if you're not
111:40 - getting value like i'm out of here
111:41 - right like sometimes my dad will be
111:43 - talking and i'm like man this guy's
111:44 - going on a tangent
111:45 - how do i get out of this call you know
111:47 - but then i'm like dad let's talk about
111:48 - something else
111:49 - so like that's the important part if you
111:52 - can truly have something that's valuable
111:54 - that's
111:54 - usually just a great way to go about it
111:57 - um i'm gonna take a question from
111:59 - aldo okay thanks
112:02 - uh that's this is a great and i was
112:05 - thinking
112:05 - about making two uh or
112:08 - three channels because i love technology
112:12 - yeah um
112:16 - stuff like anthropology because i'm an
112:19 - educator
112:20 - so do you think that i can make some
112:24 - uh work about it in
112:27 - those three fields what is it that you
112:29 - love topology
112:31 - anthropology anthropology what else
112:34 - and developing as a developer
112:37 - and technology the first video that i
112:40 - will
112:41 - do is it's about technology it's about
112:44 - you use an ipad yeah to study
112:48 - and i think it's great but later on i
112:51 - will talk about anthropology because
112:53 - it's related
112:54 - to education uh
112:57 - but do you think that it helps to have
113:00 - two or three channels
113:02 - and keep feeding those two three
113:04 - channels
113:05 - and to see uh
113:08 - no no so okay i have a i have different
113:11 - answers on
113:12 - this okay so most people don't even have
113:13 - bandwidth for one channel
113:17 - right like most people don't have the
113:18 - bandwidth or the ability to create ad
113:20 - volume or at scale or do it justice even
113:22 - at one channel
113:24 - right so uh doing three like
113:27 - even we have 15 plus employees a clever
113:31 - programmer
113:32 - and even this is hard to produce do a
113:35 - second channel i'm now starting a
113:37 - personal brand channel right rafikaze
113:39 - that's where you guys are
113:40 - are at i have a youtube called rafikaze
113:43 - so like
113:44 - oh wait hold on uh which is actually
113:46 - exciting i want to actually take a look
113:48 - at this
113:48 - am i about to break um let's see give me
113:51 - one yes
113:52 - you are 988 i guess
113:56 - wow
114:01 - look at that 997. oh wait hold on
114:05 - you guys can't see it so let me actually
114:06 - show it to you guys my bad i stopped
114:08 - sharing
114:09 - but uh about to break 997 uh
114:12 - i mean about to break a thousand
114:14 - subscribers so
114:16 - remember i talked to you guys about how
114:17 - to break your first 1000 subscribers
114:20 - guys
114:22 - yesterday isn't that cool that
114:24 - i'm doing that in real time
114:26 - right now so it's not just yeah
114:30 - if i should go subscribe to him so he
114:31 - can reach us
114:34 - they're like we should subscribe to him
114:35 - so it breaks a thousand thank you guys
114:37 - that was not my point but
114:38 - i really appreciate it thank you that's
114:40 - not why i did this
114:41 - so let's go smash the subscribe let's go
114:46 - um man so oh
114:55 - [Applause]
115:02 - i was waiting for uh nine nine nine and
115:05 - i just because
115:07 - that's amazing same thing i was waiting
115:09 - for 9.99
115:11 - yeah what people keep doing is they keep
115:12 - uh when you play this game with people
115:14 - if you do it live they keep
115:16 - unsubscribing so then they can be the
115:18 - one to like do the thousand subscribe
115:20 - and i remember i was like seeing this i
115:21 - was like oh my god
115:23 - people would keep unsubscribing
115:28 - um yeah so although what the hell were
115:31 - we talking
115:32 - about i'm sorry yeah about delivering
115:35 - into oh cool but i think that i'll
115:38 - i will try to mix technology and
115:40 - education
115:43 - yeah like for example you can make apps
115:45 - on anthropo i don't know bro like
115:47 - anthropology app
115:48 - you know and then like infuse the
115:50 - passion or you can give anthropological
115:52 - like
115:53 - um examples when you're talking about
115:56 - programming so like
115:57 - infusing it i think is a good idea i
116:00 - think just
116:01 - the bandwidth required to make three
116:03 - channels grow is
116:04 - really really really really it's like if
116:07 - you're like
116:08 - you know i want to have uh i want to
116:10 - have
116:11 - kids but like i don't know which kid is
116:13 - gonna be the best or like how i can have
116:15 - like a really really great child
116:17 - so let me just have triplets right now
116:19 - and then like let's go and uh like
116:21 - they're all gonna be and then whichever
116:23 - one is great like i'll just go with that
116:24 - one
116:25 - like don't have triplets right now bro
116:29 - it's going to be really hard i'm
116:32 - saying so
116:32 - i appreciate that that's that's what i
116:35 - would say it's
116:36 - it's hard it's like yeah so and i loved
116:39 - your chair
116:39 - and your likes oh thanks afraid that's
116:42 - awesome
116:43 - yeah yeah this setup took freaking years
116:46 - but
116:46 - i used to sleep under like i had a my
116:48 - whole channel was built when i was in
116:50 - like a 400 square foot office like a
116:51 - tiny office
116:52 - and i would like it would be always so
116:54 - heated i would always need to put like
116:56 - napkins under my armpits because it
116:58 - would just get
116:58 - so hot and there was never air and
117:02 - we would work we would work like 15 or
117:05 - 18 hours and like i would sleep
117:07 - under the under the desk and then i
117:09 - would wake up and then start the next

117:13 - a sob story i could have went to my
117:15 - parents house

124:08 - 1916. okay uh you already have 342
124:12 - subscribers
124:14 - yeah um the story behind this channel uh
124:17 - i made
124:17 - multiple videos but just one day i woke
124:21 - up and found some motion guy hacked the
124:23 - channel oh
124:24 - all the videos got deleted
124:28 - wait how can somebody hack your channel
124:29 - dude i don't know like
124:32 - my password is really so long
124:35 - do you have siblings no
124:39 - yeah i have do you have any older
124:40 - jealous siblings of you
124:42 - i don't write data let's start with the
124:46 - family first
124:48 - so no kidding so
124:53 - like nothing ever got deleted on my
124:55 - youtube bro and people know
124:57 - my youtube you know so like i would
125:00 - i would are you giving out your
125:02 - passwords to random people
125:04 - no it's like i changed them and they are
125:07 - very long yeah
125:08 - like it's hard to guess them do you have
125:10 - they are not related to me do you have
125:12 - any
125:13 - do you have any like do you have a hunch
125:15 - of who who it could be
125:17 - i feel like this is getting interesting
125:18 - it's from russia i got the ip address
125:21 - oh maybe they were using it he even put
125:23 - his nose
125:24 - maybe it was your brother maybe it's
125:26 - your brother using a proxy
125:27 - everybody knows how to proxy right vpn
125:30 - okay cool so uh the only reason i'm
125:33 - asking that is i don't want this happen
125:34 - to you
125:34 - later so enable two-factor
125:36 - authentication okay
125:38 - okay so if you have two factor and then
125:41 - like change your passwords you change
125:42 - your passwords
125:44 - yeah okay cool so you'll be fine you're
125:46 - a developer you know what you're doing
125:48 - thanks just like yeah thank you so much
125:52 - now on this video the what i will say is

126:09 - yeah yeah sure so what i want you to
126:12 - know is like
126:13 - try to make your thumbnails the simplest
126:16 - way you can make good thumbnails is by
126:17 - making them
126:18 - less busy just more like really simple
126:22 - the less you can have your you can't go
126:23 - wrong with less you can go wrong with a
126:25 - lot
126:26 - on your thumbnail so like here there's a
126:29 - lot
126:29 - that you're trying to do with this
126:30 - thumbnail like you literally just took
126:32 - like some
126:32 - the whole page and put it on here so
126:34 - when i look at it immediately
126:36 - i'm not gonna click on it if it's in my
126:38 - home recommended right
126:39 - how people watch videos is they go to
126:41 - their youtube recommended
126:43 - right a lot of you are watching your
126:45 - videos by based on what youtube is
126:46 - recommending to you right
126:47 - right in this field and then you click
126:49 - on it so
126:51 - if i see that image i'm not gonna click
126:54 - on it because it looks like a
126:56 - it looks like a pamphlet it looks like a
126:58 - flyer
126:59 - like a marketing flyer or something you
127:02 - know
127:02 - so make it less busy um
127:05 - if you can add your face in there you
127:07 - have a great personality with the smile
127:09 - have that and just have one word like
127:11 - flutter or something
127:13 - oh okay right like i would have here's
127:15 - how actually would do your thumbnail
127:17 - okay
127:18 - so um do we have a photo of you
127:26 - all right let's see um
127:30 - i do want to be mindful of time so i
127:32 - want to make sure that
127:33 - we don't actually like go too crazy with
127:36 - this
127:37 - but let's go and um
127:41 - just another thing bro uh an easy way
127:44 - for him to create
127:44 - uh thumbnails is using canva yes so
127:48 - canva or you can use photoshop so like
127:50 - this i know this is not the picture of
127:52 - you that we're gonna be using i know
127:53 - this is like
127:54 - um you know this is this is a small just
127:57 - an avatar photo that you have
127:59 - but honestly even a thumbnail like your
128:02 - face in it
128:03 - with like flutter logo so like let me go
128:06 - here
128:07 - and go flutter like this logo
128:12 - right yeah with like literally some text
128:15 - underneath it
128:16 - flutter
128:19 - like weird colors all kinds of craziness
128:22 - happening but
128:23 - you're already much better
128:26 - and like people are more likely to click
128:28 - this
128:29 - then they are likely to click the other
128:31 - one that has too much on it
128:34 - okay okay so like i would i would have a
128:37 - good i would choose a good photo of you
128:39 - here
128:40 - so it's like full screen kind of like
128:42 - that right on the right-hand side
128:44 - and a flutter does this is this starting
128:46 - to look like kind of like a regular
128:48 - youtube thumbnail
128:50 - yeah see what i'm saying so
128:53 - this is kind of what you want to do you
128:54 - want to like keep it simple
128:56 - image some words done simplicity will
129:00 - get more clicks more
129:01 - views more whatever all right
129:04 - um thanks so much yeah so at this point
129:08 - i want you to just go all in bro

130:52 - and uh these are all your videos yeah
130:55 - yeah
130:55 - yeah okay cool so now i'm just gonna
130:57 - look at like
130:59 - titles and stuff like that okay this is
131:01 - valuable because you're teaching
131:02 - um how to create a package convert a
131:05 - video
131:06 - like i like i like value
131:09 - so every video that you have is it seems
131:12 - valuable so i like that
131:14 - uh this is all about you and it's a
131:16 - promo so i
131:17 - i kind of i go away from those things
131:19 - but other than that like i like all of
131:21 - these
131:22 - the direction you're headed in um is
131:24 - there a specific video you want me to
131:26 - look at
131:27 - uh you can probably uh look the last one
131:29 - yeah this one
131:30 - actually that is my latest video still
131:32 - six hi everyone
131:34 - welcome to my channel the destro dev
131:35 - show today we'll talk about
131:38 - array.prototype.flat
131:39 - the only thing i would change there is i
131:41 - would uh reverse the order
131:43 - i would say what this video contains
131:45 - first and then i would talk about my
131:47 - channel
131:48 - this shows me that you're thinking about
131:49 - yourself first and the audience second
131:52 - it's a big mindset shift that i want you
131:54 - guys all to change
131:55 - audience first you second or if you can
131:59 - you last okay uh whenever you guys have
132:02 - a conversation with somebody
132:04 - which type of person you enjoy having a
132:06 - conversation with the person who speaks
132:08 - about themselves the whole time and then
132:10 - asks you or do you guys enjoy your
132:11 - conversation with somebody who listens
132:13 - the entire time
132:14 - which person do you guys enjoy more go
132:16 - ahead and just say it out loud
132:17 - listens yes we're thirsty to be listened
132:22 - to right
132:24 - same thing here value first your thing
132:27 - second
132:28 - let's see the code first good you get
132:30 - into it so fast
132:31 - this was like the best that i've seen
132:33 - out of all the videos we've watched
132:35 - i mean we only watch one person's video
132:36 - but like i like how fast you're getting
132:38 - into the actual value
132:46 - by doing it is flattening the nested
132:49 - so the video is like really early i want
132:52 - you to keep speaking and using your
132:54 - emotional human energy to guide me
132:56 - through it almost imagine like a slide
132:59 - right the more momentum i start picking
133:00 - up in the start then
133:02 - later the momentum just keeps taking me
133:05 - right
133:05 - so or like think about a car going
133:07 - downhill like in neutral in the start
133:09 - it's hard to push the car but then it
133:11 - just gets going yeah
133:13 - so you're you're deciding to put a lot
133:16 - of your quiet
133:17 - parts in this here in this area right
133:19 - there
133:20 - that's too that's really dangerous in
133:22 - this part is the part where you actually
133:24 - need to
133:25 - push the car okay
133:28 - this part is already rolling i'm already
133:30 - addicted and
133:31 - hooked and watching so even if you are
133:33 - quiet here i'll i'll be okay
133:37 - see what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah yeah
133:40 - so like you're quiet you're just typing
133:45 - um
133:48 - yo frankie what are you up to yo nas
133:50 - what are you guys up to right now
133:52 - oh you want to grab some food let me
133:54 - just watch this video for a second
133:56 - um all right bro let's go grab some food
133:59 - you see what i'm saying like you lost me
134:00 - bro
134:01 - like literally i can have a conversation
134:02 - with somebody i can talk about grabbing
134:04 - t
134:05 - i can do texting on my phone so like you
134:08 - need to hold my attention you need to be
134:10 - speaking the whole time
134:11 - so an example of it would be like first
134:14 - right let's get into it so guys right
134:16 - now what i'm going to be doing is we're
134:17 - going to flatten the array so let's
134:19 - create a variable called flatten my
134:20 - arrays equal to myarray.flatten
134:23 - my array if you guys hit tab it will
134:25 - auto complete it do you see how i'm
134:26 - using my voice to energetically
134:29 - keep you going through it yeah
134:32 - it's energetically keeping you going
134:34 - through it
134:35 - yep if i run and
134:38 - your audio quality is really good this
134:40 - flat method you speak well and clearly
134:43 - your screen is looking great and you're
134:45 - using zsh the same thing i use that's
134:47 - good but
134:48 - do this and run if i do this
134:52 - it will be basically the same if we want
134:55 - to
134:55 - flat if you want to make videos that are
134:57 - extremely direct and to the point
135:00 - look up fire ship and look up cory
135:01 - shaffer if you just want him direct
135:03 - to the point model the pace of cory
135:06 - schaefer you'll notice they're
135:08 - even though their energy is lower but
135:09 - their pace is really fast
135:12 - then that too there is cool so
135:15 - good video those are my notes for you
135:17 - okay let's move on to the next one
135:20 - look at mine uh okay
135:23 - awesome one second one second guys i'm
135:25 - looking also at the chat
135:27 - so the next person that dropped their
135:28 - thing is muktum
135:31 - um hussein
135:35 - are you there
135:39 - if you're not there in part like if
135:41 - you're not there i might have to skip
135:42 - you i want you to be actually there
135:44 - okay so yuri let's go with you
135:49 - okay cool
135:54 - okay i already like your title
135:58 - yeah sharing your screen bro oh my bad
136:01 - so only i'm liking the title
136:02 - i was still stand corrected
136:11 - oh
136:12 - [Music]
136:17 - okay intro is too long nice
136:21 - [Music]
136:24 - dude she's got like trap music playing
136:26 - and everything
136:27 - yes that is sick
136:34 - the number one and the most fascinating
136:37 - reason
136:38 - is that you can convert ideas into
136:40 - reality
136:41 - okay so great i'm loving it um
136:45 - you got i you're gonna do really well
136:47 - because you're the type of person so
136:49 - you're ready like
136:50 - you're actually a type of person that
136:51 - people want to listen to and follow
136:54 - okay so i haven't played a lot of this
136:55 - video so not a lot of people will get a
136:57 - sense of that but i know you
136:59 - your words hit hard and like you're just
137:03 - you have like a leadership thing going
137:05 - okay not a lot of people have that
137:06 - people
137:07 - maybe are good conveyors of information
137:10 - but you
137:10 - have leadership going you can literally
137:13 - make videos
137:15 - just like this for a hundred videos and
137:18 - i would not be surprised if you're like
137:20 - 50 000 subscribers
137:21 - just yeah like a little bit short on my
137:25 - android phone actually my
137:26 - sister was holding the camera for me yes
137:29 - people literally want to follow you
137:31 - because
137:31 - you're they want to actually be like you
137:33 - and they want to have that mentality and
137:35 - they're
137:35 - like you have something that's the
137:37 - really valuable part about you
137:39 - so you just need to keep the camera on
137:42 - and speak more like
137:43 - and you're good the only tactical things
137:46 - i'll tell you is your music is too loud
137:48 - and it it drowns out your voice i can't
137:51 - hear you over the music
137:53 - so i so like whatever app you're using
137:56 - you need to bring your music down to
137:57 - like negative 12 decibels or maybe even
138:00 - negative
138:00 - 20 decibels your voice should be zero or
138:03 - 12 decibels
138:04 - positive and it will it will create it
138:07 - so your voice pops out
138:08 - okay so don't make me compete between
138:11 - music and your words
138:12 - then i will start listening to music
138:15 - intro
138:16 - good job on the intro you have a really
138:18 - cool intro i would make it like
138:20 - one second long like so okay i'll tell
138:22 - you like right when i get bored of it
138:23 - okay i'll
138:24 - tell you like right when i want you to
138:25 - switch it
138:27 - [Music]
138:31 - right there okay a second longer and
138:36 - it's like it's painful to me like almost
138:38 - like oh
138:43 - so four to five seconds too long cut it
138:54 - good so that's my tip to you other than
138:56 - that your title is looking great
138:58 - uh i like your channel oh my god and you
139:01 - got the thumbnail game on point
139:03 - you just need to make more content you
139:05 - just need to make more content um
139:07 - just another thing bro uh like what i've
139:09 - seen on yeah clear programmers content
139:11 - like
139:12 - when you're going through the title like
139:14 - you're actually speaking in the
139:15 - background and the slide
139:17 - like the title comes up and there's a
139:19 - slight background music
139:20 - like you don't like speaking right you
139:22 - know yeah yeah so you could do like
139:24 - what yeah yeah so you could do it both
139:27 - ways so amana brought up a good point
139:28 - like you can keep speaking the title
139:31 - uh and have it playing or you could do
139:32 - what you did if you do what you did you
139:34 - got to keep it short
139:35 - that's what makes it clean so like for
139:37 - example
139:38 - i'll show i'll show you um an example of
139:42 - this okay so let me know
139:44 - that top five programming languages
139:46 - right not that one but i i
139:48 - uh i you already know that one but i'll
139:50 - give you a different example of an intro
139:52 - so like in these videos i'm doing an
139:54 - intro right and i want you to actually
139:56 - pay attention to the intro so for this
139:58 - video i'm going to play
139:59 - [Music]
140:00 - oh i'm not sharing my screen oh okay
140:03 - okay thank you thank you guys
140:05 - so for this video i want you to watch
140:07 - how quickly the intro happens okay
140:18 - [Music]
140:22 - i'm really did you see the intro
140:24 - sequence yeah
140:25 - yeah yeah it's just a few seconds i get
140:29 - my signature that's part of my intro
140:32 - where it says rq
140:33 - is a frame it's a fraction of a second
140:36 - it goes so fast
140:37 - that you can't even see my actual like
140:39 - uh let me
140:40 - like i can't even pause there i
140:42 - literally cannot pause there even if i
140:44 - wanted to but you guys see that little
140:45 - rq that happens really quick
140:47 - so that's so when i say the intro it's
140:50 - like from
140:52 - here it's hard to let go until whatever
140:55 - but like just it's just short
140:59 - i'm really that's it so i i recommend
141:03 - making intro just a little bit shorter
141:04 - outside of that
141:05 - great video you just need to do more and
141:06 - you'll you'll win okay so like uh
141:09 - what's your suggestions on the thumbnail
141:12 - is it
141:12 - right like your thumbnail is pretty good
141:15 - your thumbnail is pretty good
141:16 - um let me actually tell you if there's
141:18 - something i find annoying about it let's
141:20 - see
141:21 - um i think like
141:24 - it's a little busy so like i would just
141:27 - maybe remove this
141:29 - like this okay like that the dude at the
141:32 - bottom right
141:34 - uh the apps coming out from the phone at
141:37 - the bottom left
141:39 - okay if you want to make a really good
141:41 - thumbnail like a
141:42 - really good one you looking at the
141:45 - computer and coding and just the image
141:46 - of you from the side
141:48 - like an image of you from the side
141:49 - coding generally is like the best way to
141:51 - do it
141:52 - it's the simplest and it works really
141:54 - really well
141:55 - outside of that great thumbnail good job
141:58 - okay thank you guys
142:00 - okay cool all right um
142:03 - let's go zach carson
142:06 - ultra dark roast please zach where are

142:18 - get into it
142:19 - so we'll go with zach uh i'll share the
142:22 - screen
142:25 - uh i love that song
142:29 - [Music]
142:30 - that's like literally one of my favorite
142:32 - songs
142:34 - it's awesome
142:37 - [Music]
142:43 - well i love them
142:51 - [Music]
143:01 - i like that song okay so let me actually
143:03 - just go to your channel first i'm going
143:05 - to go to your channel
143:06 - i'm going to switch to this um
143:11 - how how long ago did you start okay one
143:13 - year ago
143:15 - all right
143:22 - all right you know what you're doing
143:26 - like on youtube it seems like you know
143:28 - what you're up to
143:30 - like when i look at this it looks like
143:32 - somebody who's
143:33 - who understands how youtube works they
143:36 - haven't done it
143:37 - long enough so like
143:40 - why are you not making more videos like
143:42 - why is your last video like five months
143:45 - ago and there's like
143:46 - months long gap in between them why
143:49 - um yeah that's kind of like the problem
143:51 - for me is just like
143:53 - finding finding the time trying to like
143:56 - put out content i mean there is time but
143:58 - like
143:59 - trying to like prioritize well it's not
144:01 - important to you then
144:02 - it's not your priority okay
144:06 - yeah like to me all this means is like
144:09 - when i see
144:10 - this is i know what i'm doing i spent
144:12 - all this time learning it but eh it's
144:14 - not a priority
144:15 - i don't feel like it's important okay i
144:18 - can't want it for you do you think it's
144:20 - important for you
144:21 - yeah like you actually want to do it
144:24 - yes i do why why do you want to do it
144:30 - well i mean
144:33 - to like give other people um
144:38 - like i i know like whenever i watch like
144:41 - music videos or something you know it
144:42 - just like
144:43 - kind of helps soothe me you know just
144:45 - kind of like it's soothing it's nice and
144:48 - relaxing to watch yeah
144:51 - but so you're telling me you want to do
144:54 - it right
144:55 - yes but at the same time you're lying
144:57 - straight to my face
145:01 - okay because your words are telling me
145:05 - you want to do it
145:08 - but your actions aren't
145:13 - so you can be the sweetest person on
145:14 - planet earth and i can love you
145:16 - i love your energy but like
145:20 - i don't want you to look at me straight
145:22 - in the face and lie
145:24 - and i don't want you to look at yourself
145:26 - straight in the face and lie
145:28 - okay if you wanted to do it then you
145:31 - would have been doing it
145:34 - tell me tell me certain things you like
145:36 - doing that you
145:38 - do on a regular day like just tell me a
145:40 - few things that you do
145:42 - throughout your day like what's an
145:43 - average day in zack's life
145:45 - um i like to edit videos okay what else
145:49 - um i mean obviously play play the piano
145:52 - okay
145:53 - great what else um
145:58 - i mean that's usually what i focus on i
146:00 - mean but what are the things do you do
146:01 - do you scr
146:02 - like do you not scroll on facebook or
146:04 - instagram or youtube
146:06 - dude like texting your phone he's a big
146:08 - time consumer
146:09 - okay youtube is what you like
146:13 - consuming youtube is what you want
146:16 - to do and if you told me that that's the
146:18 - truth because you're actually
146:20 - if i look at your phone i can see the
146:21 - time you're investing in there
146:23 - yeah if i actually look at the time
146:25 - you're spending playing piano you
146:27 - want to play the piano and it'd be the
146:30 - truth that you would be telling me
146:31 - because you're actually doing it if i
146:33 - had a hidden camera
146:34 - there would be x hours of footage behind
146:36 - it
146:39 - right yeah so youtube doesn't seem like
146:41 - something you want to do
146:44 - okay that i just
146:48 - have to call you out on your on
146:49 - that
146:51 - like you have you have talent you have
146:54 - the skill to do it
146:56 - why are you not doing it that's the
146:59 - thing that like
147:00 - i need you to understand and i want me
147:02 - and everybody here to understand like
147:05 - why are you not doing it you say you
147:08 - want to do it
147:09 - but you're not doing it so why is that
147:13 - i guess i just have to want to do it
147:17 - more you know i guess that's what it is
147:23 - okay and part of wanting to do something
147:27 - more
147:27 - requires you to do what
147:31 - um i mean put forth work
147:34 - i guess maybe right
147:37 - maybe put forth work yeah
147:40 - yeah maybe put forth time and energy
147:43 - into it
147:44 - yeah and actual hours behind it
147:48 - okay right so like
147:52 - that is the last missing piece of the
147:54 - puzzle here
147:56 - it seems like you you enjoy it it seems
147:58 - like you get it
147:59 - it seems like you have a knack for
148:01 - editing and you enjoy consuming content
148:03 - and
148:04 - there are a few things that tell me you
148:05 - enjoy consuming content one you told me
148:07 - when you tell me you're spending hours
148:08 - consuming content i spend hours
148:10 - consuming content
148:12 - another thing that tells me you consume
148:13 - a lot of content is i'm looking at your
148:14 - thumbnails and it tells me you have an
148:16 - eye for what's happening out there and
148:18 - what works
148:20 - now the problem might be you might be
148:22 - spending too much time consuming content
148:25 - yeah i i feel like that is the issue
148:28 - right
148:28 - so there's too much outside noises in
148:32 - your head
148:33 - instead of you going internal and
148:35 - creating stuff
148:37 - okay internal
148:41 - requires you to go inside
148:44 - and stop outside all right
148:49 - creation is a really weird thing it
148:50 - happens from within
148:53 - yeah okay when you're playing the piano
148:55 - and you're feeling yourself
148:56 - you know what what's happening at that
148:58 - moment it's just silence
149:00 - in you nobody around you saying anything
149:03 - in your ears
149:05 - you enjoying it and you're feeling it
149:08 - right there's a certain energy that's
149:10 - there
149:11 - like right now you're thinking about it
149:12 - you're smiling you're feeling happy
149:14 - you're in your flow state right yeah
149:18 - your hands moving and hitting the keys
149:21 - at what shows me you're passionate about
149:23 - it
149:23 - the work that's the work right
149:26 - yep so like
149:29 - you have to take your wants that you
149:31 - want like
149:33 - i had one team member a while ago on my
149:35 - team and he came up to me and he's like
149:37 - hey i want you to pay me more
149:40 - i said okay that's great um i'm like i'd
149:42 - love to
149:43 - um why should i pay you more he's like i
149:46 - want
149:47 - to help my parents
149:50 - and when he started saying that he
149:52 - started crying
149:54 - tears coming out of his eyes he's like i
149:56 - want to help my parents
149:57 - i want to change their lives i want to
149:59 - like make more money so i can help them
150:01 - blah blah blah he said all these things
150:03 - yeah i looked at him i had tears coming
150:06 - out of my eyes
150:09 - what did you think i said to him zack
150:15 - [Music]
150:17 - hmm i would think yes
150:21 - i looked him in his face and i was
150:23 - extremely sad
150:25 - and i looked him dead in his eyes and i
150:27 - said you're lying
150:34 - he wouldn't be coming in at 11 30
150:36 - strolling in to work
150:38 - 11 30 a.m when i'm the ceo and i'm
150:41 -  starting work at 5 or 7 a.m
150:44 - right he wouldn't be leaving before
150:47 - everybody else leaves
150:49 - like he wouldn't be you know like
150:53 - and so that's the thing
150:56 - the actions are the truth you can want
150:59 - something you can feel emotional about
151:01 - it
151:01 - but like if people who have done
151:04 - you can't lie to them like yeah so like
151:07 - you have to treat yourself the same way
151:10 - don't lie to yourself either because
151:12 - it'll start with yourself then your
151:14 - boundaries will get stretched
151:15 - and everything will just feel fine at a
151:17 - certain point like yeah i want to do
151:19 - youtube i want to do this on
151:21 - and then like it's you start to spread
151:25 - your
151:25 - own boundaries of what you can do and
151:27 - what you can do even in a relationship
151:29 - right if somebody wants to be in a
151:32 - faithful relationship with their partner
151:35 - right and they're like i don't want you
151:36 - to cheat on me and it's actually one of
151:38 - the boundaries in the relationship and
151:40 - that will end it that's a fair enough
151:41 - boundary right for most relationships
151:43 - yeah
151:44 - right well what happens if you go ahead
151:46 - and cheat anyway and she lets you come
151:48 - back and be in the relationship or he
151:50 - lets you come back and be in the
151:51 - relationship what is that
151:53 - that's stretching the boundary that's
151:55 - stretching the boundary right eventually
151:57 - what happens is that your partner's
151:58 - self-esteem goes to negative
152:00 -  1 000. self-confidence drops to
152:03 - negative 1 000.
152:05 - and then you're you create a
152:06 - co-dependent weird relationship
152:09 - that has
152:10 - no boundaries and right and so just it
152:14 - gets downhill from there
152:16 - same thing we start doing with ourselves
152:18 - we're like one we want to do youtube
152:20 - then we're like all right we're gonna
152:21 - do it then we do it and then we like
152:23 - stop doing it
152:24 - and we say we're and it happens in many
152:27 - many other areas of your life it's not
152:28 - just happening in youtube bro it's
152:29 - happening
152:30 - many other areas of your life probably
152:32 - right now where you're like there are
152:33 - things that you want to do and you like
152:35 - mean to do and you know they're going to
152:36 - change your life but then you get on
152:38 - them and you stop them
152:42 - right so it starts to become a pattern
152:45 - and so that's what i want you to be
152:46 - careful about because you have so much
152:48 - potential
152:49 - i can see it in your eyes i know you
152:51 - have so much hunger
152:53 - but now your work has to actually match
152:55 - it or you need to be called out on it
152:57 - and you need to call yourself out on it
153:00 - with love with love with the with the
153:02 - beautiful smile like you have
153:03 - right thank you but truth and the actual
153:07 - work
153:08 - yeah okay i agree so
153:12 - you know when you check next week and
153:14 - the amount of hours you spent scrolling
153:16 - on instagram or youtube or greater than
153:17 - the amount of hours you spent on your
153:19 - own youtube
153:20 - i can't help you there's not a single
153:21 -  soul in the world that can help
153:23 - you
153:24 - okay yep okay
153:27 - so what are you gonna do as a result of
153:29 - this conversation
153:32 - i'm going to make sure i don't you know
153:35 - spend
153:36 - too much time you know just like not
153:37 - overdoing
153:39 - the whole um youtube cool so not doing
153:43 - is a difficult vague task it's not clear
153:46 - oftentimes we lack clarity not
153:48 - motivation so like if you pick a task
153:51 - that's
153:51 - vague it's going to be difficult to
153:53 - actually execute on it because what does
153:54 - it
153:55 - actually mean right like maybe you're
153:57 - sitting there and you're like does it
153:58 - mean i don't just use it in the bathroom
154:00 - but then i can
154:01 - use youtube when i'm like outside of the
154:03 - bathroom waiting in line
154:04 - you see what i mean so it's like it's
154:05 - not clear so like let's set a clear
154:08 - goal of like maybe not even a gold
154:10 - something you're running away from let's
154:12 - maybe set a goal of what you want to run
154:14 - towards okay
154:16 - okay is that fair enough yeah what can
154:19 - you run
154:19 - towards what is one action that you can
154:22 - do and i don't like to think about
154:23 - actions a week from now that's
154:26 - because that's just not gonna happen or
154:27 - that just tells me that you're not
154:28 - serious about it and you don't want it
154:30 - right okay so what's an action that
154:32 - you're gonna do
154:34 - to make sure that you're actually
154:36 - focusing on youtube
154:38 - right after this zoom call is over
154:44 - shoot a video that's what the i'm
154:46 - talking about
154:47 - guys everybody give him a round of
154:49 - applause
154:53 - that that is money right there
154:57 - okay zach and okay so like right now
155:00 - that came to my mind go ahead like since
155:04 - he's doing a piano right it's not about
155:06 - something programming or anything
155:07 - it's piano what he can do is like just
155:10 - simply just
155:11 - do a time lapse like since he plays
155:13 - piano every day he can just
155:15 - simply record that and upload it on
155:17 - youtube you know
155:18 - yes that's a fantastic way to start okay
155:21 - or okay
155:22 - what i want you to do is the only thing
155:24 - i want you to add
155:25 - is when the video starts just be like
155:27 - guys i'm going to be playing the cover
155:28 - of
155:29 - xyz and then just show me the
155:32 - you actually playing it okay all right
155:35 - that's what i want to see from you
155:36 - i have so much hope for you i have so
155:38 - much faith in you because i can see hope
155:40 - in your eyes and i can see that
155:42 -  smile and it lights up
155:44 - everybody's day here i just want you to
155:46 - put in the work behind it because i'm
155:48 - desperate for you to actually get the
155:50 - results

158:15 - this video is going to be up there
158:16 - anyway but if you want to take notes
158:18 - it's more internal as you can
158:20 - i would remove this thing because it's
158:22 - confusing and i don't know what it is i
158:23 - would just like not have it ever in any
158:25 - video ever again
158:27 - i'm coming to you live and in person i
158:30 - love your energy i love your smile i
158:32 - love the way you speak i want to see
158:33 - your face in every video
158:35 - this time um i want to give you an
158:38 - introduction on
158:41 - this channel since this is my first nice
158:44 - good music great music i would lower it
158:46 - a little bit so i can hear your
158:47 - beautiful voice
158:48 - over the music extremely clearly okay
158:50 - stacy
158:51 - okay first video and i just want to
158:55 - um get to know you guys we
158:58 - don't want to be pill and paddling with
158:59 - this additional subtraction
159:01 - you've got um you have your buttons
159:04 - and everything import so that's the
159:07 - module that will be
159:08 - great so now that you're getting into
159:10 - the technical stuff i'm loving it
159:12 - nice you're making a tekinter app with
159:15 - python i love it great
159:16 - uh i would reduce the audio i'm sorry
159:19 - the music by a lot
159:21 - i'm loving how you have yourself here so
159:23 - a lot of you guys are doing screencasts
159:25 - guys your personality is a gift
159:27 - stop hiding yourself um you so
159:30 - like put that like you're the ultimate
159:32 - asset
159:32 - so use it you know like seriously use it
159:36 - like i'm i'm so crazy about
159:38 - like self-esteem and all this stuff i
159:39 - think it's the most important gift that
159:41 - it can give you making youtube videos
159:43 - and stuff and then
159:44 - how it plays out in a like over your
159:47 - entire
159:48 - life is just massive right like you
159:50 - start developing low self-esteem then
159:52 - you have kids then they develop low
159:54 - self-esteem and then your daughter is
159:55 - dating somebody who's abusive because
159:57 - your daughter can't put boundaries
159:58 - because she doesn't have self-esteem
160:00 - like it plays out in really awful ways
160:04 - use youtube to like boost up your
160:06 - self-confidence and self-love
160:08 - and praise and reduce judgment on
160:11 - yourself
160:11 - learn to look at yourself and be happy
160:14 - right like learn to look at your face in
160:16 - a video and like
160:18 - actually stop judging yourself so
160:21 - there's
160:22 - there's such a beautiful opportunity for
160:24 - growth here internally
160:26 - like you know and then the external
160:28 - results will follow too so if you want
160:30 - to do it selfishly like how do i make
160:32 - the fastest money or subscribers
160:33 - the same way like if you actually work
160:35 - on your self-esteem and all of that
160:37 - you're gonna get
160:38 - the most amount of sales the most amount
160:39 - of youtube views the most amount of
160:41 - followers you know because people want
160:42 - to follow
160:44 - people who they would like or who they
160:46 - want to be like so that's the fastest
160:48 - way to grow
160:49 - so i would i don't know if this thing
160:51 - stays there the whole time stacy
160:53 - if it stays there for a limited amount
160:55 - of time that's okay i wouldn't leave it
160:56 - there the whole time
160:58 - okay um i like where you are at here and
161:02 - coding
161:02 - that i love um i would
161:06 - somehow figure out a way to maybe
161:07 - increase a resolution
161:09 - on the screen is it a windows laptop
161:13 - yes windows okay well yeah okay cool
161:16 - all right nice job with the comment
161:18 - below i love that
161:20 - you're giving me a reason to engage
161:22 - you're giving me a ton of value
161:23 - i like that you're annotating on the
161:25 - screen makes it very clear for me what
161:27 - to do
161:30 - um the only way the only way i would
161:33 - improve it is
161:34 - i would remove this pop code maker stuff
161:37 - i really don't know what that is it
161:38 - stays just for so long
161:41 - um and i would show your app in the
161:43 - start
161:44 - so like we're gonna be making a
161:46 - calculator app with python and then i
161:48 - would actually

162:38 - spotlighting okay
162:39 - so i spotlighted okay cool so here we go
162:42 - i'm gonna take a look at your page now
162:44 - okay um and what type of roast are you
162:47 - looking for
162:53 - light roast medium rose dark roast what
162:54 - are you looking for or anything
162:56 - espresso okay cool actually
163:00 - i i started this channel today but oh
163:03 - yeah nice good job that's amazing
163:08 - yeah awesome three hours ago i see it
163:11 - all right so let's see here so i'll just
163:13 - start spitting out
163:15 - what i think and then you if you want to
163:17 - take notes go for it okay
163:19 - okay um
163:22 - oh so this video is about how to
163:23 - download high quality videos from
163:25 - youtube okay cool
163:26 - yeah um so i would
163:30 - so like nobody cares about this
163:33 - because they don't know this so i would
163:35 - not have
163:36 - this being there at all okay
163:40 - your face is already here so you're the
163:42 - brand so you don't need to also have
163:44 - this
163:45 - so like this is great and you got a
163:48 - beautiful face so just that's perfect
163:50 - right there
163:51 - i would remove this and i would make
163:54 - this
163:55 - much bigger okay
163:58 - um i would make this white text much
164:01 - bigger so it takes up
164:02 - like maybe a lot of space like this
164:06 - okay um and then i would just have like
164:08 - a youtube logo so if i
164:12 - if any of you guys yeah i mean if you
164:14 - guys want to go really far with it you
164:16 - guys can sometimes even send me a
164:17 - thumbnail
164:18 - image and then sometimes i might just
164:19 - make something on the fly to give you an
164:20 - example
164:21 - but yeah i would i would have the
164:23 - youtube logo right here
164:25 - like that i would not use pink
164:28 - background because it makes it hard to
164:31 - read
164:31 - i would use like a black background or a
164:34 - white background
164:36 - and then i would have the text like
164:39 - download youtube videos for free
164:42 - something like that or
164:43 - just like download videos so the less
164:47 - text you can have the better on a
164:48 - thumbnail
164:52 - okay that's crazy other than that great
164:54 - thumbnail
164:55 - and then let's get into the title is
164:57 - good how to download high quality videos
164:59 - from youtube easy two ways for free so
165:01 - title is good
165:03 - nice great start today
165:07 - nice today what i'm gonna be talking
165:10 - about i'm three seconds in
165:12 - nice smile standing in front of the
165:14 - camera talking confidently good posture
165:18 - from youtube in the first step i'm going
165:20 - to show you how you can eventually i
165:22 - want you to invest in a mic
165:23 - right now it's okay just keep going with
165:25 - this youtube software to download video
165:28 - from youtube
165:28 - and in the second step i will show you
165:30 - how you can use a third party software
165:32 - what i like to do in the start of the
165:34 - video is just like pop in few things so
165:36 - for example if you say youtube
165:37 - pop up the youtube logo right here like
165:39 - an image that's it
165:40 - right then when you say download uh
165:44 - drop a download image you know like a
165:46 - logo of download and what download looks
165:49 - like just drop that right here
165:50 - and maybe just like text come up comes
165:52 - up right here that says download you
165:54 - know just for a few seconds while you're
165:55 - talking
165:56 - as you say those things to download
165:58 - videos from youtube
165:59 - in this twist i will show you how you
166:01 - can download a high resolution and high
166:03 - quality videos
166:04 - great on youtube i know the tricks i'm
166:06 - going to show you will blow your mind
166:08 - off
166:08 - nice i love that i know the tricks i'm
166:11 - gonna show you're gonna blow your mind
166:12 - you're like also foreshadowing what's
166:14 - gonna come you're keeping me excited for
166:16 - what's to come that's great
166:18 - so let's get into it
166:21 - [Music]
166:23 - so this is the part where you're gonna
166:24 - lose me and a lot of people
166:26 - um just speak this you know it's not a
166:30 - slideshow so you might lose people with
166:32 - so much text don't have so much text
166:34 - just see you can speak this part also
166:37 - it's really hard to
166:38 - read this it's really hard like to
166:41 - use font that's easy to read because
166:44 - this font is
166:45 - very like weird
166:49 - all right guys okay so yeah resolution
166:53 - is really hard to see
166:55 - um like you see what i'm talking about
166:57 - like it's really hard for me to read
166:58 - anything
167:00 - really hard so uh
167:03 - you gotta do it in a way where i can
167:05 - read stuff
167:06 - so i would work on increasing the
167:08 - resolution when you export the video
167:10 - because it's like really hard to read
167:14 - okay cool um
167:17 - other than that great job you're
167:19 - dropping valuable content you got a
167:21 - great thumbnail i would just improve
167:22 - the video uh video quality okay that's
167:26 - the number one thing i can give you
167:27 - great job awesome give him a round of
167:29 - applause guys awesome job awesome
167:31 - awesome awesome great
167:34 - great okay cool um
167:37 - who wants to go next oh wait okay let me
167:39 - see
167:40 - we got joey we got zach elson
167:44 - let's go with zach because i don't think
167:45 - i did anything with zach elson
167:50 - um camera on perfect beautiful there's
167:53 - zach
167:53 - nice sitting sitting with vimhoff
167:57 - i like it let's go medium roast
168:01 - all right medium roast cool here we go
168:07 - it's like people want the dark roast um
168:11 - okay cool so here we go we got managing
168:13 - anaconda environments
168:16 - okay great i mean it's hard to go wrong
168:18 - with technical content you it's like
168:20 - that's what i love about technical
168:21 - content like
168:23 - it just works because people like need
168:25 - it it's kind of like needing medicine
168:27 - you need medicine you know even if the
168:30 - receptionist isn't the best
168:32 - you'll still buy your advil because you
168:34 - need your headache to be gone or
168:35 - something you know so like technical
168:36 - content people just need it like they
168:38 - need water so
168:39 - hard to go wrong with it i would
168:44 - thumbnail is a lot going on so i would
168:49 - what i would recommend again is an image
168:51 - of you on the right side
168:52 - and an image of anaconda or jupiter or
168:55 - something on the left hand side
168:56 - generally that's what i recommend it
168:58 - works really really well
168:59 - it's just the easiest and the cleanest
169:01 - thing
169:02 - stay away from so much text on your
169:04 - thumbnail there's tons of text create a
169:05 - new anaconda environment load the kernel
169:07 - into jupiter
169:08 - anaconda individual edition tutorial
169:11 - python3 python data
169:13 - change like there's a lot of text
169:16 - in this whole thing is tons of text so i
169:19 - would simplify it by just having your
169:20 - face
169:22 - a logo and one word face logo in one
169:26 - word generally is like one of the best
169:29 - cleanest ways to do it all right let's
169:32 - go into the video
169:34 - hello and welcome to you where i try and
169:37 - break down
169:37 - data analytic practices into easy to
169:40 - understand
169:41 - and digestible bits a great intro
169:44 - fantastic intro
169:46 - to hopefully make them a little bit
169:47 - simpler you may have recently installed
169:50 - the anaconda package for machine
169:51 - learning or data analytics
169:52 - nice but you don't really know where to
169:54 - start you may have seen something about
169:55 - anaconda environments
169:57 - but don't really understand them yep in
169:59 - this video
170:00 - i'm going to try and do a simple
170:02 - straightforward look at managing the
170:03 - environments and how to use them
170:05 - so i like that where he's like
170:06 - empathizing with me where he's like hey
170:08 - you might have downloaded it but you
170:10 - might have been confused about what's
170:11 - the step that happens next
170:13 - yes always whenever i dealt with
170:16 - anaconda
170:17 - uh because i'm in the code like i'll you
170:19 - know i'm a developer so like when i
170:21 - was learning programming i always had
170:23 - trouble with this so
170:24 - when you say that it is great great
170:28 - and slideshows you can't go wrong with
170:30 - them if you guys have slideshows those
170:31 - videos do
170:32 - really well why do you use the
170:34 - environments or
170:42 - so really a lot of time being quiet
170:45 - i would change that i would make sure
170:47 - that i'm like now you're taking me to
170:49 - really black screens psychologically and
170:51 - emotionally for a human being
170:53 - it's not very fun to look at this how
170:55 - many of you guys are like
170:57 - your eyes are having fun looking at this
171:01 - it's glazed over already yeah like a
171:04 - developer
171:05 - so like uh this is why in my videos i
171:07 - try to even make my terminal look like
171:09 - it's fun
171:10 - right like when i turn my terminal as
171:12 -  ton of colors and it's like
171:13 - exciting to look at
171:15 - um this is exciting to look at this
171:18 - isn't
171:18 - so if you take me to this at least use
171:21 - your voice or talk or
171:23 - do something where it's moving it
171:24 - otherwise i'm
171:26 - you're gonna lose me around here so just
171:28 - to create your first
171:30 - environment
171:42 - so my feedback is the
171:46 - start is really really good i love the
171:48 - slides and i love how you
171:50 - don't just completely start the
171:52 - technical part right
171:53 - like away you kind of wait a little bit
171:56 - and you warm me up to it and then you
171:58 - get into it i would just
172:00 - increase the energy just the quickest
172:02 - hack i can give you is increase your
172:03 - energy and like literally even if you
172:05 - start saying what you're doing
172:06 - helps so all right guys we're gonna work
172:09 - on this boom and then if you're really
172:11 - messing up or really slowing down it
172:12 - really just doesn't have any
172:14 - movement to it you can add really light
172:16 - music in the background oh wait
172:19 - other packages oh you're here at the
172:20 - bottom right
172:22 - what the i didn't see you there
172:27 - so he's right there
172:32 - um if we want to let's say so i would
172:36 - put me like much bigger or
172:39 - you know um some were
172:42 - visible you know so like i would put
172:45 - myself where like
172:46 - because then you give me you to look at
172:48 - so i would put it here
172:50 - or here but bigger you know much bigger
172:52 - because
172:53 - where you put yourself nobody looks
172:55 - there
172:56 - you won't be seen i'm just trying to not
172:58 - cover the code
173:00 - and so i wanted to make sure i was out
173:01 - of the frame you'll be fine
173:04 - you'll be fine uh and in editing
173:06 - sometimes if it you do really block it
173:08 - you can move it a little bit in in like
173:10 - you know
173:11 - in post you can move yourself for
173:12 - something so
173:15 - um but you'll be fine there's usually
173:17 - not that much happening on that side of
173:19 - the screen
173:22 - jupiter notebook so let's go ahead and
173:24 - close it other than that good technical
173:26 - video just keep making more okay
173:29 - okay great job great job um okay let's
173:32 - give him a round of applause guys zach
173:34 - nice awesome great work fantastic
173:38 - okay who wants to go next who wants to
173:41 - go next
173:42 - i'll go next i own act let's go okay
173:46 - all right i'll open up your video
173:50 - so the older ones i just used for like
173:52 - social proof
173:53 - and the two new videos are kind of what
173:55 - i'm
173:56 - trying to do
174:00 - oh this is you oh dude
174:04 - this is gonna be a good one thank you
174:07 - i spent over 1 000 in collectibles and
174:10 - i'm talking about sports cards
174:12 - and comic books i mean yeah you're gonna
174:14 - win but the pokemon type that's going on
174:16 - right now with celebrities like logan
174:18 - paul and logic
174:20 - starmie two cards left
174:24 - charizard you're doing it on something
174:26 - that's trending extremely relevant
174:28 - it's very entertaining so far i was
174:30 - hooked right in the start did you guys
174:31 - feel you were hooked right in the start
174:34 - yes yeah so i have a confession i spent
174:37 - over 1 000
174:39 - in collectibles so i have a confession i
174:42 - spent
174:43 - over 1 000 in collectibles four seconds
174:45 - in
174:46 - i'm hooked i'm talking about sports
174:48 - cards and comic books but the pokemon
174:51 - now you got gary vee and a simpson
174:53 - reference so like now i'm in
174:55 - because i might not know you i might not
174:57 - even pay that much attention to pokemon
174:59 - but garyvee and other things one hype
175:01 - that's going on right now with
175:02 - celebrities like logan paul
175:04 - and live when you do logan paul i'm in
175:07 - i know logan paul i watch his i'm
175:10 - in and then you throw logic so that's
175:12 - another big one for a lot of people so
175:13 - guys this is called
175:15 - borrowed authority like even if you like
175:18 - if you start your video and you start
175:20 - talking about bill gates and melinda
175:22 - gates and
175:22 - like tony robbins and steve jobs like
175:25 - all of a sudden i'm paying attention to
175:27 - you because you've almost borrowed their
175:29 - authority
175:30 - social proof because i'm like oh this
175:32 - person is going to say some relevant
175:34 - stuff because i know those people
175:38 - it's crazy but it works starmie
175:41 - two cards left hit the notification bell
175:44 - it's the best way to awesome support
175:46 - this channel and allows me to give you
175:48 - guys as much free value as i can
175:50 - every day and what type of roast are you
175:51 - looking for bro um
175:53 - harsh as possible i'm really just trying
175:55 - to like improve as quickly as i can
175:58 - like i i think i can be good at doing
176:01 - youtube videos but just
176:02 - anything that could possibly help me
176:04 - grow faster is what i'm asking for
176:06 - um okay cool so let's go here
176:10 - yeah the older videos are more for like
176:12 - social proof that i used to film back
176:14 - then so i don't really count those as
176:16 - good quality content
176:17 - and then if you can maybe give me like
176:19 - some marketing tips possibly i'll be
176:21 - very helpful if anything
176:25 - can i say something sure yes
176:28 - i honestly from the look of it i think
176:30 - it's pretty good channel and his video
176:32 - would be like
176:32 - if i was to watch it be very
176:34 - entertaining to watch
176:36 - that's just like from my perspective
176:39 - i think he's doing a really great job
176:41 - yes thank you i'm gonna continue off of
176:43 - that
176:43 - so uh
176:46 - ioneck um your biggest
176:49 - problem here is um you have
176:55 - you made two videos
176:58 - yeah so you are you're like one of those
177:02 - channels that's gonna blow the up
177:04 - you're one of those channels
177:05 - i appreciate it thank you what i would
177:08 - tell you to improve in your videos
177:09 - improve your video quality because it
177:13 - seems like you're really shooting with a
177:14 - webcam
177:15 - which you you probably are right webcam
177:18 - yes
177:18 - so i would improve the video uh the
177:20 - video quality
177:22 - uh what are you doing for the audio your
177:23 - audio sounded decent
177:26 - uh typing out uh notes on a notepad uh
177:29 - for the
177:30 - i'm doing a yeti yeah your audio sounded
177:34 - good so your audio is good
177:36 - your it's your video i would improve but
177:38 - don't make that a thing that stops you
177:40 - from making more videos
177:42 - okay so keep going um outside of that
177:45 - dude you are gonna kill it you just have
177:47 - to keep going
177:48 - there's no marketing tactic there's no
177:50 - strategy there's no hack there's no
177:52 - youtube ad thing that i'm gonna tell you
177:53 - that's gonna
177:54 - you have to just go you have to keep
177:56 - going like for example right
177:58 - even if i run youtube ads to my youtube
178:00 - channel it's gonna temporarily flood
178:02 - traffic but that's not going to do
178:04 -  then it just ends so like i might
178:06 - get 4 000 views
178:08 - but then it just ends the way you
178:10 - actually grow on a platform is if you
178:12 - make good
178:13 - content for the platform that by itself
178:15 - keeps growing
178:16 - if your is dependent on you having
178:18 - to go to facebook groups to promote it
178:21 - it's never gonna grow it's
178:23 - temporary
178:24 - does that make sense so like um as
178:28 - advice from you you just recommend just
178:30 - having patience
178:31 - from what i'm understanding and just
178:33 - kind of just just hustle them
178:35 - right it's called
178:36 - so i will give you the ultimate thing
178:38 - okay you want the ultimate secret to it
178:40 - yes please okay it's called the magic
178:43 - 70. i want you to write that down on
178:44 - your paper right now
178:46 - okay the magic 70. my notepad yeah
178:50 - okay this is the
178:53 - most important rule that has helped me
178:55 - and is with
178:56 - guaranteed results like i i have had
179:00 - this rule for not just for myself and
179:01 - all multiple other people even my
179:03 - clients that helped them grow to like
179:05 - over
179:06 - hundreds of thousand subscribers and
179:07 - they've done millions of dollars of
179:08 - revenue and started from complete zero
179:11 - the magic 70 rule is the ultimate thing
179:14 - that has
179:14 - had them be successful and me be
179:17 - successful okay
179:19 - what this rule is
179:22 - and i'm going to say it in a harsh way
179:24 - but this is just how my brain thinks and
179:26 - it's just like
179:28 - shut the up for 70 videos
179:31 - and just go for 70 videos
179:36 - just shut the up and do the actual
179:38 - work
179:40 - 70 about 70 videos in is where you'll
179:42 - start seeing breakthroughs it might
179:44 - happen
179:44 - earlier it might but 70 videos is like
179:48 - i don't look at success when i look at
179:50 - people's channels i'm not looking at do
179:52 - you have 71 views you have 150 views you
179:55 - have
179:55 - 5 000 views on a video 10 000. i'm like
179:57 - did this person produce 70 videos
180:00 - what's the goal like look at the actual
180:03 - make the number of videos your guys's
180:05 - goal
180:06 - if you set a goal like subscribers or
180:09 - viewers
180:10 - it's so random it's not in your control
180:13 - do you guys does that make sense guys
180:16 - like for example if you set a goal of
180:18 - having an eight
180:19 - pack somebody can genetically a lot of
180:22 - people on the planet can't genetically
180:24 - even have a eight pack
180:26 - so if you set a goal that's in numbers
180:29 - and subscribers you're just
180:30 - bound to be unhappy set goals
180:33 - on in terms of your process set goals in
180:37 - terms of
180:38 - quantity and then hit those goals
180:41 - and you will dominate so your
180:44 - guys's goals
180:45 - should it be i want to get to 2 000
180:47 - subscribers by the end of this month i'm
180:49 - gonna
180:49 - your goal should be i want to make
180:52 - 15 i commit to making 15 or 30 videos
180:55 - this month
180:57 - see what i'm saying so that goal is
181:01 - actually going to be the thing that
181:02 - leads to the ultimate results
181:04 - the the process-based goal so like for
181:07 - you if you have
181:09 - a lot more videos and you're going
181:10 - you're gonna crush
181:12 - okay ionic i want you to
181:16 - commit to something here and i want you
181:18 - to think about it
181:19 - but i want you to give us a goal that
181:21 - you commit to
181:22 - for the month of not even december not
181:24 - even something far off in the month of
181:26 - november
181:28 - how many more videos are you going to
181:30 - produce i want to um
181:33 - i'm trying as best as i can because i
181:35 - have like a business i'm running on the
181:36 - side but i try to make a goal to at
181:38 - least do
181:39 - one video how much okay so this business
181:42 - that you're doing on the side
181:43 - what is it why you're doing it how
181:45 - passionate you are about it and how much
181:47 - are you making from it
181:48 - uh for that i so i used to sell like
181:50 - tours and stuff
181:51 - when i was doing that i was making
181:53 - around four grand a month and for this
181:55 - side business
181:55 - with flipping cards and everything else
181:57 - it maybe comes out
181:59 - now i'm taking like a small pay cut of
182:01 - like two grand a month just selling in
182:02 - person
182:03 - but i'm trying to scale up and use the
182:05 - uh youtube platform to basically do my
182:07 - marketing to sell some sort of product
182:09 - it's just a lot of hustle work
182:11 - and ground work that i understand that
182:13 - i know you went through and it's like a
182:14 - shit-ton dude it's like 60-80 hours a
182:16 - week
182:17 - so it's tons of tons of work in the
182:19 - initial beginning that i have to do
182:21 - but to get to your uh answer your
182:23 - question
182:24 - i'm planning on doing at least one video
182:25 - a week if i can have more time
182:28 - opened up okay i'll tell you this
182:31 - if you sucked at videos uh and you had a
182:34 - long way to go i would tell you just
182:37 - do your other job as much as you can and
182:39 - do this within a very limited amount of
182:40 - time
182:41 - you're killer at videos i'm not
182:45 - saying this to blow smoke up your ass or
182:46 - whatever and i also don't want you to
182:48 - just listen to it and just be like oh
182:49 - now i'm not gonna do anything with it
182:52 - what this means is you need to lean into
182:54 - this as hard as
182:55 -  like no it's not a matter of if
182:58 - it's gonna happen it's
183:00 - gonna happen like i'm not literally i'm
183:02 - not trying to motivate you
183:03 - like my goal here is not to motivate you
183:05 - i know
183:06 - that this is gonna happen because i see
183:08 - your channel and it's actually good
183:10 - videos good thumbnails the videos dialed
183:12 - in
183:14 - go the other way bro try to maximize
183:16 - this as much as you can
183:17 - give up the short term cash for a little
183:19 - bit this will be the fastest explosion
183:21 - to your revenue goals or whatever goals
183:23 - you have right now you're making two
183:24 - thousand dollars a month is that what
183:25 - you said
183:26 - yeah two thousand with no job just
183:28 - selling um how much
183:30 - how much do you need to just purely
183:32 - survive every month
183:33 - um i i try to aim for three to four
183:37 - that's my thing how much not even a goal
183:39 - how much do you need to just pay the
183:40 - bills and
183:42 - like eat food and 1500 1600
183:45 - okay like little less than two do
183:47 - whatever it takes to make 1600 and every
183:50 - single other second i want you
183:51 - to just put into this
183:53 - 100 they're so close to blowing up you
183:55 - don't even know it

184:18 - this but drop your intention for what
184:19 - you plan to do this week as a result of
184:21 - this conversation
184:22 - so like set a specific goal in zoom chat
184:25 - and if somebody can amana you can read
184:27 - it out loud once you see it
184:28 - um i want to see you actually taking
184:31 - action on it because the
184:32 - the worst thing is hearing something
184:35 - feeling something and not like actually
184:37 - taking action on it that's
184:38 - the worst thing so um set some kind of
184:42 - intention for this week so then you can

185:41 - kate
185:41 - and i'm going to be talking to you guys
185:43 - about codecademypro
185:46 - and big question we all want to know
185:49 - why there are so many outlets right
185:51 - behind me
185:52 - is it worth it just kidding just kidding
185:54 - okay so
185:56 - hey so okay you want you want a dark
185:59 - roast but i
186:00 - will i will just do what feels fair to
186:02 - me
186:03 - okay okay so
186:08 - start how's it going guys
186:12 - start is great there's something with
186:13 - your camera is it like is it not
186:15 - focusing on your face
186:17 - like is it out of focus it was um
186:20 - a transition that i thought looked
186:24 - question i guess it's questionable but
186:25 - it was a transition that i added no no
186:27 - no no like i mean like even right now it
186:29 - looks like it's not
186:30 - your face doesn't look like completely
186:32 - in focus frankie am i making this up
186:35 - doesn't look like yeah it's like there's
186:37 - something
186:38 - oh you mean oh is is it so not a
186:41 - transition you mean like you added an
186:43 - effect to make it a little blurrier or
186:44 - what
186:45 - no in the very beginning i added a
186:47 - transition but i don't know about right
186:49 - now it shouldn't be blurry
186:51 - do you guys feel like the face is a
186:52 - little bit blurry
186:54 - you guys yeah
186:57 - i think it's focusing on your hand
186:59 - motion okay
187:01 - um now it looks a little bit more in
187:04 - focus actually
187:05 - so not not the end of the world okay let
187:07 - me actually give you what i think
187:08 - i think fantastic energy
187:13 - i'll let you know nice i like that we
187:16 - all want to know
187:18 - i would project more your voice
187:21 - you're a very kind person and i can feel
187:24 - like you're soft like you're
187:26 - soft-hearted and like you're
187:27 - a little bit quieter on the quieter
187:29 - spectrum i would project louder
187:33 - okay okay thank you because i want to
187:35 - hear your voice you have a great voice
187:36 - you have great personality great
187:37 - charisma i would project louder
187:40 - academy pro and big question we all want
187:43 - to know
187:46 - how's it going guys my name is kate and
187:48 - i'm going to be
187:49 - talking to you guys about co pro i like
187:52 - that
187:53 - right in the start you tell me what's
187:54 - going to be happening so like i'm
187:56 - i complimented that about a few people's
187:58 - because the worst thing is like not
188:00 - knowing what's happening right in the
188:01 - start
188:02 - um the same thing i'll tell you is that
188:04 - first four seconds i would swap it
188:07 - them first right like
188:10 - so so you say hey guys i'm
188:15 - you say who you are first and then you
188:17 - address what's in it for
188:18 - the audience address what's in it for
188:21 - the audience first
188:22 - so swap okay it's a little mindset shift
188:26 - but it's actually a really
188:27 - deep level shift because um essentially
188:32 - you're thinking about yourself first an
188:34 - audience second and then it comes out in
188:35 - your video
188:36 - not again not um any of this stuff like
188:38 - i want you to hear me because you're a
188:40 - very
188:40 - kind person so when you hear my things
188:42 - you might actually take them
188:44 - really to heart so just understand that
188:46 - i'm
188:47 - it's micro it's a tiny thing okay so
188:49 - just a little swap
188:51 - bro and big question we all want to know
188:56 - is it worth it
189:00 - i'll let you well cool let's all get
189:02 - there
189:03 - it's okay caitlyn i love it you have to
189:05 - do it you have to
189:06 - you have to do it you have to own it you
189:08 - got to keep going and you got to keep
189:09 - doing it more and more and then
189:11 - there will be one day where the timing
189:13 - is right and it punches in and punches
189:15 - out at the right time
189:16 - so like little hacks i can tell you so
189:18 - like you did a joke and you want to make
189:20 - it land
189:21 - so what like the big props i'll give you
189:24 - is you actually
189:25 - executed it so great job on that
189:27 - okay so you have to
189:28 - thank yourself for that later you'll
189:31 - start learning how to actually make it
189:32 - land so like for example a few things
189:35 - that can be happening is you can keep
189:36 - playing the music
189:38 - and you'll be like what's it worth
189:41 - you can take you can pull out the music
189:43 - when you're saying
189:44 - was it worth it oh
189:47 - see what i'm saying another thing you
189:50 - can do
189:51 - is you can punch in so like when you're
189:54 - editing you can zoom into your face more
189:56 - for that one bit so you're
189:59 - yeah see what i'm saying so the whole
190:01 - point of your joke is it's a pattern
190:03 - interrupt right it's like
190:04 - so guys today we're going to be talking
190:05 - about codecademy pro and the one
190:07 - question that we all have on your mind
190:09 - punch in was it really worth it stop
190:12 - like stop the music punch in as soon as
190:15 - my joke
190:15 - lands punch out start the music again
190:19 - just that you see it
190:22 - oh yeah that would that would totally
190:24 - that would sell it a lot better right
190:26 - so just little things but the biggest
190:28 - thing you have to thank yourself
190:29 - taking the effort and taking those shots
190:30 - okay so let's go back
190:37 - cool i would fasten up just a tiny bit
190:41 - because it's a little long especially if
190:42 - it's in every video it ends up taking a
190:44 - lot of time
190:45 - here is my personal co academy pro
190:48 - um and but they
190:52 - um so i would recommend
190:56 - you get a yeti mic yeti pro
190:59 - or yeti some type of yeti i'm imagining
191:01 - you're using your laptop's mic here
191:04 - it was actually some like it's called
191:06 - like an irig i think it was actually a
191:08 - mic
191:09 - so oh perhaps i probably wasn't close
191:12 - enough though
191:12 - oh okay pretty cool this cute little
191:15 - quiz
191:15 - okay okay that is part of the free
191:17 - version as well so one thing
191:19 - i don't know why so here's one thing
191:20 - i'll tell you sometimes people like
191:22 - that mic to not be in the video actually
191:25 - what i think is i think it's actually
191:27 - cooler that for
191:29 - the mic to show like i actually think
191:31 - it's cooler i actually put it
191:33 - you guys see me with my mic right like i
191:34 - actually enjoy it
191:36 - i think it makes the video look better
191:38 - um
191:40 - so all right okay
191:44 - so yeah i was trying to hide it right so
191:46 - if you're not
191:47 - feel free to put it in the video if you
191:49 - want
191:50 - audio quality is more important than
191:52 - video quality
191:55 - so 60 emphasis i put on audio
191:58 - and 40 on the video so that's why on
192:00 - ionex video
192:01 - i'm like okay with him using a webcam
192:05 - because his audio quality is good and
192:07 - then his video is good so like i don't
192:09 - really mind it that much like viewers
192:11 - don't mind it but if your audio quality
192:12 - is lacking it's like
192:14 - this uh it's distracting because
192:16 - especially if you're trying to teach me
192:17 - something technical i don't want to like
192:19 - fight to hear you and understand what
192:22 - you're saying
192:23 - i'm an engineer back end engineer a lot
192:25 - of background noise i would
192:27 - uh yeah full stack but i just had so
192:30 - much fun
192:31 - great personality like you feel it like
192:33 - what you're saying you're like i just
192:34 - had so much fun doing it i love that
192:36 - because
192:37 - it takes me through what we're doing i
192:40 - hate when people are just monotonous and
192:41 - just like a machine
192:42 - i personally it stops me from going
192:46 - these challenge projects are open-ended
192:48 - projects
192:50 - where they pretty much i think that your
192:53 - channel if you go it it it can be one of
192:56 - those like landmines that can blow up
192:57 - few things i would change about it um
193:01 - if you and i are friends and we're
193:02 - sitting and literally we're sitting at
193:04 - like
193:04 - the lunch table or the dinner table i'm
193:06 - just looking your face and i'm like yo
193:08 - what do you need to do to make your
193:09 - video
193:10 - just work and hit home few things audio
193:14 - is probably the best thing i can give
193:16 - you like get it today you have a nice
193:18 - apple watch i know you can afford it so
193:20 - get it today
193:21 - um get a yeti
193:24 - it won't cost you more than 70 bucks
193:25 - it'll be here today if you get it with
193:27 - amazon prime or by
193:28 - by latest tomorrow so the first thing
193:31 - yeti
193:32 - yeti mike i would keep it up close so i
193:34 - make sure the audio is good
193:36 - i would put the gain almost on zero
193:40 - you guys see how close i am to my
193:42 -  mic like i'm making out with my
193:44 - mic you guys see this
193:45 - how close i am to it it's important for
193:48 - you to be
193:49 - like audio quality is so important it
193:52 - helps you actually pay attention and get
193:54 - through it
193:54 - so make sure that you're up and close to
193:57 - your mic
193:58 - and i reduce the gain to zero that way
193:59 - you guys won't hear that hum
194:01 - and hot like the background room noise
194:06 - oh okay gain to zero yeah i put my gain
194:09 - to zero
194:10 - i just like literally just kill it
194:13 - completely
194:14 - you can have it a little bit if you want
194:15 - but i just say get closer
194:18 - and speak like that and so i would add
194:21 - audio
194:22 - outside of that i would
194:25 - have you speak just either a little bit
194:27 - louder
194:28 - um and that would be good sometimes
194:31 - there are pauses that are happening
194:34 - that are a little bit on the longer side
194:36 - so either you can
194:38 - edit that out or you can just work on
194:40 - improving your energy
194:41 - so like engage with me more and tell me
194:43 - more jokes so keep it going
194:46 - or get it then sit afterwards and edit
194:49 - like you don't have to go
194:50 - crazy edit every single pause you could
194:52 - edit some of like the big ones out that
194:54 - you feel like reduce the flow to slow
194:56 - down the flow of the video
195:00 - okay other than that yeah i'm pretty bad
195:02 - at talking so
195:04 - no no don't say that you're good at
195:05 - talking you're really good
195:07 - oh okay why does it say there's no
195:09 - videos
195:11 - because i only have one oh it's unlisted
195:16 - oh yeah i have it unlisted just because
195:18 - i
195:19 - i still have to fix my channel and
195:21 - upload the banner and stuff okay
195:23 - so here's the most important part of
195:25 - this journey where we come to okay
195:29 - we can't move forward on this call
195:32 - until this one thing happens but i want
195:35 - from you caitlyn

197:33 - channel
197:34 - i'm going to tell you something and um
197:36 - this is important okay
197:38 - did the world explode when you hit
197:40 - public
197:44 - i mean kind of in a good way though you
197:47 - all liked it
197:48 - right there we go so here's the crazy
197:51 - things
197:52 - we think that hitting public or publish
197:54 - is kind of like hitting like a detonate
197:56 - button
197:56 - and there's a lot that happens it's like
198:00 - weird how anti-climactic it is like
198:03 - nothing happens when you actually hit
198:04 - public
198:05 - like literally nothing happens like
198:08 - i've made so many videos there was never
198:11 - a single time a really cool thing
198:13 - happened when i hit public it's always
198:14 - like
198:15 - literally like crickets it's like quiet
198:17 - and i just hit public
198:21 - okay i guess publish now okay
198:24 - moving on so um sometimes you'll put on
198:27 - a pedestal
198:29 - what i want you to for you caitlyn like
198:32 - in terms of the
198:33 - dark roast i'll give it with love for
198:35 - you the most important part
198:37 - that i want you to work on is like just
198:41 - you have a great personality of a great
198:43 - charisma you have great energy
198:45 - i want you to stop beating yourself up
198:49 - i want you to work on the little phrases
198:51 - like little tiny phrases like
198:53 - oh like i don't know how to talk like ah
198:55 - you know what i mean
198:57 - more love for yourself less questioning
199:00 - hit publish
199:01 - and just move forward okay
199:04 - like how did you guys think how was her
199:06 - video guys if you guys
199:08 - liked her video just let me know like
199:09 - would you enjoy the video just
199:11 - make a sound of you enjoying the video
199:13 - like whoa was it awesome like clap
199:16 - how was your video it was good it was
199:18 - good
199:19 - great it was awesome it was awesome i
199:22 - subscribed
199:23 - right thank you so right now
199:26 - right now it's good because you're
199:28 - getting like social validation from us
199:30 - but i want you to not need that
199:34 - okay got it because you're not gonna
199:36 - have it most of the times
199:38 - and if you pay too much attention to our
199:40 - social validation
199:41 - then you're also gonna pay attention to
199:43 - the negative validation like
199:44 - the negative side of it okay so i want
199:47 - you to
199:48 - uh for creating i want you to go
199:50 - extremely internal
199:51 - and don't look outward so for example if
199:54 - you have an idea just get excited about
199:55 - the idea then just make the idea
199:57 - then hit publish and move on never
200:01 - um i'm a big believer and never redo
200:04 - only iterate and improve
200:09 - this okay so like never remake this
200:10 - video when i get better ever
200:12 - okay never ever ever you might have a
200:15 - you might think you want to delete it
200:17 - you want to make no that's going
200:18 - backwards
200:20 - right like when you learned how to walk
200:23 - your mom didn't like remove your
200:26 - memories of like you not knowing how to
200:28 - walk before that
200:29 - it's just an evolution it's an iteration
200:32 - every day you become a bet like
200:33 - different
200:34 - better more evolved version of yourself
200:36 - that's how your channel is going to be
200:38 - it's a very living and breathing thing
200:40 - but you have to accept all those moments
200:41 - where you fall off the bike and eat
200:44 - see what i'm saying so like yeah just
200:46 - hit publish
200:47 - go on to the next one any improvements
200:49 - you want to make never go backwards
200:51 - move forwards and add those improvements
200:53 - to your second video
200:56 - right okay then the third video so great
200:59 - job caitlyn i'm excited for you
201:01 - thank you so much i appreciate all your
201:03 - feedback thank you for coming on i
201:04 - appreciate you
201:05 - all right guys let's give it up for
201:06 - caitlyn and let's go on to one more
201:16 - okay make one video per week
201:19 - hit 52 videos by the end of the year
201:23 - focus more time into video making
201:25 - beautiful
201:26 - that's great great job ionic yeah give
201:29 - it up for him guys great job ionic
201:30 - that's a great goal
201:32 - i love it um one video a week is a good
201:36 - goal
201:37 - 52 videos when you guys get like when
201:39 - you quantify
201:40 - that's good i want you to play
201:43 - all out but i want you to set the expect
201:46 - like i want you to expect that until
201:47 - your 70th video
201:49 - nothing is gonna happen for you i want
201:51 - you to like in a weird way
201:53 - expect that i want you to play all out
201:55 - and believe that youtube can change your
201:57 - life
201:58 - but at the same time i want you to
202:00 - expect that you're not even going to get
202:01 - 100 subscribers by your 70th video i
202:03 - mean i know you already have 418 but
202:05 - like
202:06 - that's how i want you to think then what
202:08 - happens is now you've created
202:10 - maximum amount of room of happiness
202:12 - almost like everything is going to make
202:13 - you happy
202:14 - and keep moving you forward
202:18 - you can't do better than the best that
202:20 - you can do would you guys agree
202:22 - yeah i agree but because by the
202:25 - definition is the best that you can do
202:26 - so if you set the expectations to
202:28 - negative
202:28 - and then just do the best that you can
202:30 - do
202:32 - you see how much room you guys have
202:33 - created for happiness
202:35 - like everything in between is happiness
202:39 - but if you set it the other way where
202:40 - you're not going to be happy until you
202:41 - get to 10
202:42 - 000 subscribers then it's a very unhappy
202:44 - journey all the way there
202:45 - and then so um process based goals are
202:50 - king all right we're gonna take one more
202:53 - question
202:54 - um what i want to say is i hope that you
202:56 - guys can see how you can
202:57 - get past your 1000 subscribers and
203:00 - hopefully you guys can even see how you
203:01 - can
203:02 - get past your one thousand dollars you
203:04 - could make from youtube
203:05 - it requires you to just keep going
203:07 - there's a bajillion different ways
203:10 - and i'm gonna take on one more person
203:11 - but what i do want to say is like

207:42 - [Music]
207:44 - great man this is a great intro uh i
207:47 - would say the same thing that i bet i
207:48 - say to a lot of people i would
207:51 - uh speed up the intro a little bit i
207:53 - like that you're showing me different
207:55 - images with different
207:56 - words and it has this nice like it has a
207:58 - vibe like what i like about your intro
207:59 - is like
208:00 - it has a vibe to it so i can i can flow
208:03 - with it a little bit
208:04 - so i like that it emotionally keeps me
208:06 - going reduce
208:08 - but reduce how long it is it's like 20
208:10 - seconds i would reduce it a little bit
208:14 - guys did you see that he tells you who
208:17 - he is one minute and 47 seconds in you
208:20 - guys see that
208:22 - yes it's a great way of doing it um
208:26 - you put yourself as later as you can or
208:28 - as last as you can
208:30 - do that all the time and you'll have a
208:32 - great business
208:34 - okay like be the last person to be fed
208:36 - i'll tell you guys something right
208:38 - uh we this year on track to make over
208:42 - 1.7 million dollars

208:57 - my team is making some people are making
209:01 - less money than me some people are
209:02 - making more money than me
209:03 - but my team makes more when we have to
209:05 - do everybody's
209:06 - salary and payments increase every
209:09 - single member on the team their pay is
209:10 - increased first
209:13 - let's see what i'm saying so like i will
209:16 - be the last
209:17 - who actually like gets a bump so
209:20 - like it comes out in my business when
209:23 - i'm like making a video and then it
209:24 - comes out on the team like when i
209:26 - actually have a business from it you

209:41 - thing that's scrolling at the bottom
209:43 - like a news anchor
209:44 - um i mean
209:49 - it just looks too busy i wouldn't do
209:50 - that like if you want to say something
209:52 - have text some text pop up and then it
209:54 - goes away then have more text pop up
209:56 - what you're saying
209:57 - that is better than this like news
209:58 - anchor thing don't do that
210:07 - great and sometimes if you're speaking
210:09 - you can add an image here of what you're
210:11 - talking about so if you're talking about
210:12 - money
210:13 - you could have like a image of money pop
210:15 - up right here

time all right let's do it better this time i am committed to starting my youtube channel let's go three two one go starting my youtube channel i'm gonna play a little round of applause for everybody that is here awesome guys so here's a few things that are important about like actually making a change so a few things right if we're interested in starting a youtube channel a few things one is we need to change our emotional energy and we need to get committed behind that thing number two is then we want to take that emotional energy and actually put it in motion by setting a plan a time more of the tactics does that make sense so yeah those are the things that are like uh important in making sure that your thing whatever you're dreaming about comes true so just a quick recap right on i'm gonna share my screen with you guys so you can see what i'm talking about a quick recap on the first few days the day one what we talked about the challenge give me one second let me make sure that this thing is on so i can draw for you guys oh wait guys does this keyboard work yeah it's working okay let's try again there we go so day one of the youtube challenge what we talked about is the opportunity that exists so i showed you guys you can have a picture of a fan and it can possibly get 33 million views so do you guys think that there exists an opportunity maybe for you that you could have your own youtube channel yes or no yes yes yeah great absolutely so hopefully we've overcome the challenge of the opportunity of a youtube channel uh chat uh challenge right thing number two we talked about you can how you can have your first 1000 subscribers so yesterday i started this thing where i was roasting your guys's youtube channels live that was a lot of fun uh who was here for that the roasting of the youtube channels were you guys here yesterday yes yeah nice what is olivia is olivia on this call no gabi i see you you're here i went over your channel too so we we started the series where it was like it's either going to be a light roast medium roast or a dark roast and you could drop your youtube chan channel and tell me what type of roast you want and if you wanted me to be nice you could say i want a decaf all right so if you guys want to do that today as well we can do that i think that would be a lot of fun okay do you guys want to do that at some point today yes okay awesome so we'll do it yes great it'll be great so on that we talked about how to break through your first 1000 subscribers but what's important is i want you guys to be able to believe that it's possible for you so i want to ask you guys do you believe that it's possible for you to break 1 000 subscribers yes or no yes yes yes okay you guys saw a video of a of a fan a picture of a fan with the sound of a fan for eight hours and it has 33 million views and he has 1 million subscribers so it's possible maybe for you to have over 1 000 subscribers yes yes okay yes that's really important because if we don't agree on step number one there's opportunity that exists or step number two you can have a first thousand subscribers we can't continue on to day three day four day five so with agreeing that that's possible now we come to the point of is it possible for you to be able to make your first one thousand dollars from youtube that's what we're going to talk about okay feedback feedback feedback a lot of feedback so one thing is keep your guys mic if you can if you have background noise especially please it would really help if you keep it muted if you have background noise and then when i'm asking questions just open your mic and then jump in cool guys it helps a lot by the way when you guys jump in and actually talk because right now when i'm if it's just me it just sounds like i'm a crazy dude just talking to myself but it's really exciting when you guys jump in and chat it seems like we're all sitting at a dinner table or we're just all sitting around like a fireside chat and having a chat so that's why the participation in that connection really helps plus i do believe that that level of participation will move you physiologically to then start your own cool so multiple benefits of it selfishly for me and then selfishly for you all right so for me i want to talk about what made it so i could actually make my first 1 thousand dollars on youtube i in the first so i'll show you guys there are different ways of making money with youtube can somebody list out i want you just list out one way you can make money from youtube so just open your mics and give me different ways you can make money but just give me one per person so go ahead sponsorships so somebody said sponsorships what other ways of making money are there from youtube selling merch ads selling merch right ads so youtube paying you what else monetization monetization great what else driving people to other social media okay driving people to other social media right affiliate links affiliate links great what other ways is there affiliate marketing affiliate marketing data donations what data donations donations okay cool selling coaching selling coaching great what other ways gathering data something with data okay got it freelance okay you can freelance what so basically maybe youtube might allow you to get opportunities to freelance cool anything else maybe like try merging or something uh okay email marketing that's a little can do like patreon and somebody's thing keeps saying trial version is that me or is that somebody else on the call trial version you guys hear that right the trial version um coming from alexandros or something like patreon okay so let's just mute where the voice the sound is coming from uh so you're if you want me to make you the host as well i can but i think we should be good with david and amanath okay all right so we just listed out wait host muted everyone what is happening okay cool so there are ten ways that we list it out are there any other ways you guys so we listed out ten are there any other ways patreon super chat patreon super chat okay great patreon is a different definitely away super chat yes donations people can pay you okay how about can you sell uh can you sell something that you know can you sell something like a course for example oh yeah definitely right that's possible yeah so if you have that 100 if you have a product maybe you have a service that you can sell right yeah if you show up if on your youtube you're talking people how you can make websites then maybe it's possible you can sell your freelancing time or your own like time to help somebody make websites yeah yeah cool so there are these are 13 or 14 different ways if somebody wants to write them out in chat you can uh so everybody can visually see it but there are 13 or 14 ways that we list it out so there there's no like limitation of how you can make money right from youtube there are a lot of different ways now i'll show you guys the real truth behind it okay how it actually works you guys want to see like the reality of what it looks like yeah yeah okay yes yes yes beautiful awesome i'll go i love the enthusiasm thank you guys i love it like that's like my god it's like i'm thirsty for like years and when i hear that it just gets me going i love it thank you all right so let's hit apply here right who here would like to spend ten months working their ass off and making twelve dollars me negative this is where it gets real tricky right this is where it gets tricky this is the part that everybody's like um i don't know you know i'm not sure about this but well not fulltime anyway right but who would like to make 98 000 just from youtube ads youtube paying you that's a good number that's gonna be me right bring it on exactly so i'll show you something right the 98 000 guys is made around here right 10 is made around here this is like the first 10 months almost and we're right right now we're just talking about one way of making money we're just talking about youtube paying you all right we're just talking about youtube paying you if you sold a product or a service which i highly highly highly highly recommend i don't even see youtube adds money as money i just see it as like oh this is just like just like random um so i only see the product and revenue as like the real thing so for example the first time i did a product launch like literally it at the end of december i didn't even know what the hell i was doing but i had a lot of people that i provided value for for some some amount of time and then at some point i asked for a sale i was like hey would you guys like to buy this thing and they're like yeah sure right so that's all marketing is like think about it even right now you guys are here if you're get if you're getting value from this from the last three days or even right now just let me know are you getting value from this yes or no yes right yes i'm learning a lot yes so yes if at some point i was like hey i think you should buy this would you at least consider it hey yes yeah right people are asking me what camera should i get and i'm like hey get this camera and people are buying that camera could i have made affiliate income from that yeah yeah yeah i could have made affiliate income from that right if i'm sending you guys to a specific software from final cut pro or use video leap you think i could make sponsorship income like they could pay me to send you guys to like do vid edit on a specific software definitely yes yes yes so so like i'm not telling you guys something that's just like random or a get rich quick thing right like this is requires hard work i had to develop my skills but if i can bring you value then at some point if i find a way to ask for a sale i might just get it right you guys get value i get value we keep the world moving forward make sense yeah yeah yeah so so this is the thing that um a lot of the stuff is a lot about mindset right like if you don't get past your ten dollar mark you'll never get to your 98 000 mark you'll never get to your beyond six figure mark you'll never get so this is the hardest part that i want you guys to take a look at and really really internalize because if you can really internalize this and this doesn't phase you and you actually start falling in love with it those are the people that are actually going to make a breakthrough and start something this is the part that you actually have to get through this is the hardest part but if you are like i'm not gonna go all in until i get so like let me show you something right let me show you guys want to see what happens a little bit after this like month of because this is we're looking at 2016 right so do you guys want to see what happens when i move it just a little bit over into 2017 just a little bit ahead of this sure right so if i go to 17 take a look at this and i'll i won't even go too far out i'll just go to the month of february um and we'll just go just a little bit farther out than november take a look at this okay you guys see the number of subscribers and now the revenue is getting into hey this is a good side hustle now but if you're not playing all out beforehand then it doesn't then it doesn't work for me another thing i want to share with you guys is take a look at this i started to the channel started to take off right here it wasn't taking off here can anybody tell me why the channel wasn't taking off here it's like a lot of time in the beginning for sure i think you made no videos at that time maybe you didn't make as many videos i didn't i wasn't making videos right right now talent matters those things matters but you guys saw that you could have a video of a fan and that can potentially blow up like crazy like that right i'm not telling you have a channel about that uh just to make extra money but like you could if you wanted to here's where i started taking off where like i was actually posting a bunch of videos and then pretty immediately after that right like how long did it take me to start taking off after i started making my videos how long so little time it's very little time like literally few weeks i started getting traction so that's the thing about if you really commit so if you don't commit then that change doesn't happen but if you actually commit and go in then it works now your question might be hey what does that mean i might be busy do any of you guys like how many people here have jobs you're working full time or you don't have that much free time like raise your hands if you're already like you got something going on and you don't have like not you're not full time like free right so we have a lot of us have limited amount of time i saw robin raised her hand i saw stacy clara gilberto um so when you don't have unlimited amount of time what i want to tell you is these videos that i made that actually started putting me on the map guys these videos took me i spent one hour every day between 9 p.m to 10 p.m i would work i would leave at 6 00 a.m i would go to my college then i would come i would be done with college around 3 4 p.m then i would go do my parttime jobs and i would come home at 9 00 p.m so i would leave home at 6 00 a.m i would come home at 9 00 p.m and not between 9 00 p.m to 10 p.m i had a onehour window that was the only time i had available it was just that one hour window within that one hour window i had to make things work because at 10 pm then i had to go back to sleep right so in that one hour window is where i created my videos do you guys do you guys have do you have a one hour window in your day yes or no one hour yeah sure yes yes so i asked how long were the videos you were making at that point adam yo what's up so the videos i was making at that point were between uh 20 to 50 minutes so you just did so there wasn't much editing going on i'm finding that it's taken me you know a couple hours at least to add music and do all this stuff yup so for me when i had limited amount of time i think it's worth learning how to edit but i don't think it's worth if it's gonna stop you so i would i made my process so i had no editing i never did more than one take um and i just like i would think about what i needed to speak about and then i would just do it how many videos did you bang out in like a month or like per day as well i was i started doing one a day for for quite a bit and then i started to slow down as my channel started taking off and i had to like focus on different things but like i mean i'll show you because like reality is just reality so let's just take a look at what the actual stats say so i'll move this over to 16 the first you know i got started and then we'll move this over to um move this over to december cool so let's go here so if you actually look this week i produced eight videos you guys see the dates september 1st september 2nd september 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th all of these were published right so eight videos that week eight videos this week four videos the week after that five videos the week after that eight videos a week after that nine videos a week after that eight videos a week after that eight videos a week after that two after that then took a week off then two videos and then four videos and you guys see that like and then i just exploded but uh hi qazi i have one question may i ask you now uh yes you can ask me just give me one second the explosion was caused by this guys see what i'm saying yeah yeah and something weird i'll tell you to this day a lot of it comes from this to this day four years later that's pretty cool right so that's a really important thing to understand about youtube you're essentially putting in a lot of work ahead of time and for free to create opportunity and leverage for yourself right okay all right go ahead um uh go ahead okay uh thanks so my question is that uh as you started i think four or five years ago let's say four years ago so you you said you didn't actually do a lot of editing and everything so but now the market is kind of maybe different into uh 2020 and not true you saw you saw a video of a fan right now you saw a picture of a fan huh for 10 hours and has 33 million views yeah yeah so okay yeah that's that's true that's true for sure yeah yeah yeah so yeah a very good fun but by the way yeah you're enjoying this nice so um go ahead i still want to listen to you go if you didn't finish your question go for it okay yeah so basically i can if you i'm not sure how the time will go i can take maybe one minute if possible sure i actually uh work full time i mean i work at a very good company i i'm like i work at ebay actually if i'm like oh nice you're working at ebay right that's clear so i actually saw your video uh like on on facebook first and then i was really i'm sorry curious and i joined today i mean i was probably late i'm sorry i'm sorry it's okay bro it's okay but but the thing is i mean i had one channel like a few months ago then i posted i think four or five videos and i also posted my channel link here then i was really i mean i'm really busy that's for sure but then i lost my my enthusiasm or you know everything then for last few months i have not posted any video but i mean as i work professionally for last 10 years if i can spend some time i even have like all the equipments which is needed i have my uh mirrorless camera canon m50 i have my microphone camera like yeah i have i have everything literally which is needed to begin or got a nice chair channel so yeah i mean but i'm not getting that that you know power in in my mind that i can i should invest a good amount of time and really do that but i really want to but i'm losing that power so can you choose how can i do that yep so here the here what's happening my friend is you're not like whatever it is that you're gonna be making content on that's not something either meaningful to you or you're not enjoying you haven't created a process that you actually enjoy right like why do you feel like you're not making content like you have all the equipment you have everything even though i want to make sure that you guys understand you guys hi olivia nice to have you here uh your audio your mic is off right now but i just wanted to say hi because i remember we went over your channel yesterday um awesome so shajada think about that think about i want i want you to think about that like why are you not making why are you not making videos like you guys don't need anything outside of a phone so it's important like what is stopping you shajada like i know you said go ahead that's same question to my mind actually because are you do you enjoy the stuff you're making content on i enjoy but i think somehow i'm also kind of lazy to that i'm not lazy personally i work hard i work a lot study a lot you know in technology world how it how it goes but i think when i start making videos there i'm really lazy right it's not because you're lazy it's because you one either don't have clarity of plan most of the times we lack clarity yeah um you know how can you be lazy but you are working a fulltime job like it doesn't even matter exactly you know what yeah i mean like i even work fulltime i think he's fine i think it's like the important thing here sujata for you is you're not lazy so you have to one change that internal dialogue the important thing about it is you have to do it in a way that you enjoy there's something about this process that you're doing it in a way you're not enjoying and two you're not giving yourself a clear plan so the best way that i did it is the day before okay youtube isn't something you do normally right youtube isn't something for most of you that you do normally maybe just for some of you if it's not a normal thing you're not just gonna do it randomly one day like there's no cue in your day that's gonna cause that br behavior to get triggered right it's not like for me i can drink water randomly i need it to survive right i can eat food randomly i can talk to a friend randomly because those are things that i enjoy so much and they're just kind of there they're just gonna happen some people develop a habit of exercising and that that happens automatically here if youtube is not a thing that you do it's not a part of your identity then you have to plan a day ahead or that day once you see can i ask you something uh yes go ahead so basically you're saying that we need to make it a habit and enjoy it right yes thank you thank you cozy yeah go for it yeah so i actually had a question so you know how you were saying like when you uploaded multiple videos in one week yeah you got more revenue and more people liked what you're doing right so would you recommend that we record say i start my youtube channel today okay yeah and say i just i've recorded a python course and i edited everything and i have the separate videos and everything yep should i publish one out every single day you can yes and then would that get me to the same point of when you started to boom or would i still have to wait in that sense so okay so this is where it gets tricky this is where you have to like what i'm getting paid for is essentially uh being willing to handle a lot of um i have really high tolerance to things not being clear entrepreneurs get paid a lot because they can handle uncertainty the more uncertainty you can handle the more likely you are to like actually succeed in this journey if you're looking for certainty you're this is not a good area for you to be in so like if i do this exact thing will i be in the exact same place i don't know bro you could have 20 views or maybe 10 subscribers or you could have like 20 000 subscribers it's like that part is out of your control what's in your control is the amount of effort that you actually put into it so if you can put in x amount of effort and do it for a prolonged period of time and don't see it don't be so driven to the results and the numbers you will succeed like there's literally no way you can't youtube is safer than any job you can ever dream of because at the worst case scenario and this is what i always say to people worst case scenario if everything goes to hell i can just ask for a job like i can go to my audience and i can be like hey is there anybody who has a job for me i can you know i can do a job true so yeah you see what i'm saying so ultimately it's like building relationships like all of you guys are here on this call worst kid worst comes to worst and everything is over i'll be like hey do you guys have any like people that are looking for a job one of you guys might be like yeah actually i have somebody who could use your help with this or this other thing i'm like cool i got a job now that's the worst thing that can happen i think it's safer than a job because at a job they can let you go right a job it can be and then what you have to start all over again then be dependent on somebody again depending on somebody's financial so that's the part that i want you guys to understand but i want to i really want to go the opposite route of every other guru that's out there that's talking about youtube that's talking about these things i want to go the route of opposite of like making it sound easy i want to go the opposite of making it sound like something that every single person can just get and it will happen i want you to understand the amount of work that it requires because what i believe about everybody here is that none of you is lazy what i believe is every single person that's here is looking to execute every single person that's here is hungry and ambitious and driven nobody at a friday 11 50 a.m is on a zoom call with some weird dude with purple headsets listening and talking about youtube right like i have a question i want to ask go go ahead ronald i already have a youtube channel and i have about five or maybe more um on there but i don't get no views what are you making your content how many videos have you put out ronald probably about five or six i'm i'm a minister and i do i do my uh sermons and put them on youtube you have a great opportunity so let me actually give you some tips on this i got something i got something good for you yeah my chrome just crashed so one second let me open it up um i'll get your partner mr quasi uh one second please i want to answer this question and then we'll take you on right after okay yes sir okay all right cool so let me go here oh man really awesome fan sound for sleep white noise for super slumber studying and relaxation 1.94 million subscribers all right everybody has hope i have hope too holy crap i think i've gone to sleep to that fan that's a very niche thing right there very natural very niche um let me start a channel for that ronald what's your channel called koh624 koh624 got it okay this one right here by the way just to add another thing that white noise channel is really popular i also know that channel personally nice so ronald this is your channel right yes oh i'm not sharing my screen whoops yeah i can't my bad here we go here we go so this is your channel right ronald yes okay so your thing here i already know that you're a great speaker just by actually listening to you on this call the reason why you're right now your problem is packaging so the main problem why it's not actually getting found is thumbnail and title so for example a lot of your videos the title is like may 16 2019. nobody's gonna type that in for it to come up also if i see it i don't know what's in the video so i won't click on it okay so that is one big thing and also the thumbnail so you know like for example each of these titles like this is a better title two masters lucifer wages war this is like a little bit better than something that has that's my book that's the book i wrote cool that's cool now ronald here's something else i want to tell you um nobody knows what you do and what your book is or cares about your book what they care about is the message so for example i have a product that i think is the best in the world but if i literally made a video with that product i do believe that i have the best product one of the best products in the world the problem that happens is nobody else knows that product so i'll say something and it'll be like oh what the hell like why is nobody caring but i won't that video is not gonna get any views and no but none of you guys is gonna watch it the reason why you guys are even here is i'm not even talking that much about myself like some of you guys probably don't even know how my name is spelled right and that's okay would you right like that's that's totally fine the main thing is while you're even here ronald and other people here is i'm directly addressing you totally forgetting about myself and just addressing what your pain point is what your concern what your problem is right now on this youtube why it's not going out to a lot of people is it's it's made for people who already know all this stuff which you know which is probably you and a few other people that listen to you in real life the other people who don't know your stuff it's really hard for them to find you the best advice i can give you is find somebody else who's similar to what you're doing who's also giving sermons but they're blowing up and they're getting a lot of views and you want to model your channel after them was eric thomas doing sermons at some point like eric thomas the person who does a lot of motivation like he had he had a huge channel um i mean he's here every night right yeah he i don't know if he did sermons ever but i know there are a few people who are like he did right at some point so you don't have to make your thumbnails this fancy like you could have like this right like secrets to success nothing funny this is not him doing sermons but basically he's speaking giving valuable advice so you can model a lot of things out of this so i would try to find people you enjoy ronald keep going with your messaging but thumbnail and title is the most important thing if you change that i believe your channel can grow okay second thing when you go ahead go ahead when you say thumbnail thumbnail what is that oh okay so thumbnail is this thing right here like your book cover it's like your book cover exactly so it's this thing is the image for every video but basically yeah so this over here like this cover right here is the thumbnail for this video this cover right here is a thumbnail for this video all right so your whatever you're covering you're talking about the picture of the picture of the picture that i put up yeah for the video yes the picture that you put up for the video correct yep so that is gonna be your that's your thumbnail so if you have a thumbnail that's maybe like a closer even a closer up of your face that is pretty good uh something where we can see you or see you in the middle of you talking so it looks like you're talk like almost like this right like this thumbnail is quit lying about your grind and if i look at this picture right here i can see that he's in the middle of talking or saying something i can look at this picture and the words underneath it and i'm like okay this video he's gonna like talk about quit lying about your grind it's gonna be something about passion i already know what it is before clicking into it so the problem that's happening with you is there's probably valuable content that you have but you're not giving me enough reason to click on it so okay that's the most important thing okay okay yeah and totally random and left field um if you started putting out your content on like if you you can even get somebody's help but if you put all your content on tick tock i actually believe you would grow like crazy i have a tic tac account yes i believe if you put out your content on tick tock you can point those people to your youtube but like if you just put out your advice your biggest thing is you want to get your message out to as many people as possible right yes yes so then i'm not religious about what platform it happens with the only thing i like about youtube is that's eventually where people go to go deeply and listen to you like in long form so they can truly hear your message so youtube of course like you should have but i believe that if you had a tick tock and you put out messages there that are 50 or 60 seconds small enough to be for people to consume and hear it it keeps going out to a lot of people and it'll get you really like known and then people will start watching your youtube more too okay so i actually would really release uh yeah i believe that i see okay go for a gilberto yeah and how do you overcome the fear of talking to the camera i mean i'm doing it but it feels a little bit tricky sometimes or uh let me ask you something was there any other thing in your life can you give me one thing in your life that you were at one point scared of and then you overcame it yeah almost everything i think okay so give me one specific thing running what scared you about running running 10k a race of 10k whoa nice that's awesome dude i i i was i wasn't sure if i can do it and then i prepare and that's awesome guys everybody everybody give them a round of applause that's huge so congratulations this is awesome excuse me whoo it's nothing to be scared of man thank you thank you so how did you overcome the fear of it and and then you did it i don't know i just push push myself i think can you do the same thing you think for making videos yeah i'm doing it but my question if is if you know some way to to get better to overcome that fear do you want the painful answer or you want the sugarcoated answer yeah yeah it's it's just painful like there's no secret way there's no secret okay okay thank you i will i would love i would love to sell you something for ten thousand dollars where i can help you overcome your fear but unfortunately like as much as you want to believe that there's something you just overcome like this or there's just nothing the best advice i can give you is just looking at the camera and doing it okay okay again and again and again and again and again and again so like let me can i ask a question uh yes go ahead claro um so like i'm struggling with what the content that i want to like make my youtube channel about and because i'm a beginner like coder yeah um i was thinking maybe like learn with me or something so like i'm kind of struggling just getting started got it ah okay so what is something what is something that you're so i see what your pro right your problem right now is hey i'm a beginner coder what do i make my content about yeah journey what is that what i kind of wanted to do i had the idea to do like learn with me or watch me struggle uh something like that like and maybe i'll be helping somebody else in the long run but like that's the idea that i have yeah but i don't know like how to start right so okay so a few things i want to share with you there okay so that's brilliant i love that you're already thinking about it you're already thinking about how you want to get started so that's huge so congratulations on that now the important thing that i want to mention here is for you to get started on your journey to making content the first thing is you have to there's always going to be like so many different options options lead to paralysis right like sometimes if i go to like a restaurant and they're like i'm like what do you recommend and they're like i recommend you get the grill skirt steak oh i also recommend you get the roasted mary's chicken oh by the way we have this other thing i'm like please just stop talking i'm like like i just like i feel the pain you know i'm like oh my god so many good options now i'm in just pain and i can't appreciate even one thing right so one i need a second opinion exactly yep yeah so one thing is i want you to at some point you know pick one thing and just do it it will allow you like you will start seeing a lot more as you start actually moving forward i think of it like driving a car you can't prepare for all the turns and adjustments you're going to make ahead of time right like you guys don't before you leave whoa is that an actual snake oh yeah actually actually i see the very first videos that i watched from you was what that's a thumbnail bruh oh python videos as soon as i started programming on python i decided to just get my bold python oh my god do you let your clients touch your python yeah that's a sexual harassment training just waiting to happen [Laughter] that's one of my best things i have inspired somebody to do i love that kayla kayla says that's real commitment yeah i thank you you could get viral with this thing okay i love it clara um i don't want to miss your question so um when it comes to making your content one one thing we have to just pick now the second thing is you're torn and i can feel the pain between this thing or that thing for me when i when i started learning coding is when i started making my videos okay so the best thing to study from is like not even what i'm saying but what i've done and what other people have done oftentimes that is way more valuable and truthful than the words coming out of somebody's mouth because like even if i don't want to be maybe i can be wrong or forget something right i'm human being but if you just go look at what i actually did you'll see the real answer so i'll give you an example let's take a look at this video okay um we've all heard the stories about personal data being sold why do i have ads i pay for not having ads okay all right so this video here right um clara have you learned what a for loop is in programming no i'm basically i'm learning javascript right now i i've learned html and kind of familiar with css so i'm truly a beginner okay the example i'll give you is in this one um i was learning a programming like how you're learning a language called javascript right i was learning a language called r at the time okay okay i was a beginner in this and i was solving a problem like it was just like a problem and i was like you know what i can solve it on my own and just do it but what if i just like explained how i solved it and just put it up on youtube do you guys see that i didn't even know how to make it a full screen you guys see how like this much of the screen is like not even used because i i literally did not you make something full screen on youtube right and i posted this video another thing i want you guys to tell me is i call the video r programming week two assignment one pollutant mean walk through part one you think i knew how to title videos back then no maybe not no not really oh i think you should have got a python yeah absolutely not i didn't know how to title videos right and i wasn't even trying to get views on this video i just thought i will do a random thing and it might be helpful to somebody else my only methodology that i operate with is i call it just one right how many viewers do i need for me to feel happy how many just one that's one how many subscribers how many subscribers do i need to feel fulfilled just one just one right how many people need to watch this video for them to change their life just one just one right i just need one person's life to be changed so you guys see how that makes everything so easy to do so easy right i just need one older me to watch it and get some amount of value so like when i solve this problem i'm like literally a younger me might come through this and if they see it solved it will help them that's it right i just solved the problem i put up online i didn't expect for it to get 50 000 views i didn't expect for it to do this is so helpful blah blah blah there's like um there's a student that says i'm a phd student trying to get my head around it this is a great resource i was a complete beginner and apparently i'm helping a phd wow so something beautiful happens when like look at this right oh man this is super helpful i'm very frustrated by the week two assignment as i did not know how to do that i've been using blah blah blah for two plus years something else for six months started using like i don't even know to this day i don't even know what any of that means what this guy's talking about i put out a video i didn't listen to any voices and i just moved on i just thought just one i'm gonna make how many videos am i gonna wake today just one right and okay go ahead somebody use them thank you yeah yeah so like uh there are there are some weeks in which you uploaded like seven videos or eight videos yeah so my question is like how much time it would take to you to upload uh one video like from shooting it till editing one hour okay cool i was doing it in a way where i was doing one hour so i'll tell you my secret to what got me started because i had limited amount of time so again let's just look at the truth so like here's a i'll show you the actual video right so like i'll show you my first few videos that i made oh my god how many ads which is going to be i'm going to go through the entire code category course like i didn't know we were all going to be having fun watching my younger self at one point asmr yeah it's like it feels like asmr yeah it's like so relaxing and soothing listening to it you just have this but on the fans channel just you know all the ambient noise right and i was i was sick when i was making this too it's like if you got your beard you're gonna get to go back to that something like this the beard is just a just a hack to look older you know i was like man i'm tired of looking like i'm i just came out so this video was something that i had to not script out it was just something i had to go over it was almost like i was going through a book together with you so it was like this coding thing that i was just doing for the first time and i decided to go through it online um all these videos are one take because i believe in i call it the one take wonder so i want all of you guys to become the one take wonder yeah right yeah and something beautiful about that is here's the thing uh how many of you guys believe that you can do a a video in one take like raise your hand just be honest like raise your hands yeah i do i do okay a lot of times a lot of us believe that it wasn't great yet but yeah right now one takes perfect wonders beautiful now let me ask you guys something how many of you uh when you guys are speaking with me directly or you're speaking with somebody else directly how many times you have to do multiple takes when you're speaking to a person you guys go ah i didn't mean to say that i'm so sorry cut let me say that again does that happen right so how many of us how many of us can have a conversation in one take how many of us can have a conversation in one take raise your hands everyone yeah how pretty she is right so if you can have a conversation in one if you can have a conversation in one take i like that joke by the way david so if you can have a conversation in one take with a person in real life well then you can do the same thing in a video okay you can do the exact same same thing in a video i see olivia just going crazy we need to give her some music in the back and we can go crazy with her um i love the music in her videos i get going i'm like i lost my mind yesterday so much fun so so for me my videos were were like i want to do them in a way where i only have to do one take and just speak the whole thing is i just planned out what i was going to talk about ahead of time and if it's your truth you don't have to make up it's just your truth right like ronald doesn't have to think about how does this how do i have to be how do i do a sermon like he doesn't have to be like how do i what words do i need to say to make it sound like i'm doing a sermon he actually does them so all he needs is somebody to record them and package them nicely and that's it like so for us if you're doing it on your truths you don't need to do eight different takes you know you can just actually talk about it and and share your experience or insight or the video um now i'm not making you shy away from learning editing because i think it's a good thing to enjoy it and be able to tell your story i think it's awesome to actually learn it but it's not something if you have limited time you can totally do a video in one take and then so all of my videos um and this is something i even do to this day i don't do that thing where i'm like i need to post one a day i'm not religious to posting one a day i just do it and i hit publish i do another one i hit publish i do another one i hit publish i don't like cue them i don't like schedule them i don't try to do 30 videos and then i'm gonna release one at a time i just do them and i hit publish so if you look at my channel there's there never has been any consistency in my channel but i don't i don't care some some weeks i make eight videos in 10 videos some weeks i make zero the other weeks i make 12. it doesn't matter i just keep going uh quasi i have a question um okay a lot of people are raising their hands i just started noticing so i don't know how many people were raising their hands so i'm gonna uh address them and then i'll come to you is it iona ionak yes you got it right okay i appreciate the the value you've been giving away so far thank you brother i appreciate you saying that i really do appreciate that thank you um let's go uh julio i i wonder if i'm saying your name right bro i always say julio i hope it's right yeah close close julio julio okay got it all right i mean you already touched upon uh the the points my question also before uh before i answer my question i don't know if gilberto is still here but uh i kind of have a suggestion that i started thinking about that made everything easier when it comes to yeah yeah so yeah uh one thing that i realized that made it much easier for me to start posting was don't talk to your entire audience you're not talking to everyone trying to beat everyone and trying to make sure that everyone likes you just choose a couple of friends that you know will enjoy your content right when you do that now you're pleasing just a handful of people much easier for you to say okay i know that they will like what i'm going to say that makes you feel good and just consider the rest of the audience just people that are spectating and if they don't like you oh that's money let me play some sounds for that say that for the comments that i received in one video or in one of my videos no wait no what i don't know nothing nothing nothing for your question before you were saying the fear how to overcome the fear of talking to the guy yeah yeah yeah so what what he's saying is imagine like you're talking like gilberta you have you have friends yes yes okay good thumb what's name your one friend that's a good friend andres andres okay when you look at the camera when you speak to andres how do you feel normal normal right now so when you look at the camera i want you to look at the camera like you're looking at andres okay so speak to that one person that's what he's saying that's what julia is saying to you ah okay i get it i get it oh thank you thank you very much that is actually money that advice is actually really money but you you have to actually like you can even say it like andres let me actually let me say that back and then go and say it like actually like you're talking to him my first youtube video my first one is actually made for one person so i wasn't even trying to play games i was literally trying to help a person do their coursera assignment and i'm even saying his name in the video that has 50 000 views right now like i'm actually saying his name so if it helps you can even say the person's name you're talking to and just let other people be confused when they're watching the video i'm not on grace all right so going back to my question but i'm glad that that might help um so my question is do you have a specific so there's there's a difference between like when you're doing one take you're going in free flow right so you're just talking to the camera you're not really scripting anything um and you mentioned that sometimes you do prepare right so that preparation phase yeah do you have a specific structure that makes it easy so that you can follow some bullet points without scripting it too much yes yes yes yes 100 uh let me actually see if um i can pull up uh yeah okay give me one second i let me see if i can actually pull up something that i can actually show you okay so let's go here so i'll give you an example okay so this is what it actually looks like so here's a video i wanted to do about like uh i wanted to do this series which i actually should do which was pretty cool and it was a series i was doing on billionaire developers so like mark zuckerberg uh steve jobs those people and i had a lot of like really dense concepts that i wanted to share like it dense thoughts not just something you can just sit there and just chat like dense because i was like going deep into some of these books and i was pulling out facts and i was using that to construct my video and construct solid arguments so for that i was writing down bullet points so like here you'll see like best developers outperform average developers not by 10x or 100x by what but by 1000x and i wanted to quote this part and it was from a book called uh i think the book is called essentialism or something like that right so that um i wanted to reference deep work by cal newport so i made sure i wrote that i wanted to talk about the salary of developers making over 100 100 000 so i wrote i first just wrote out all bullet points okay then i came up with like what this video will be called i came up with like 10 or 15 different titles all right so like average developers versus 1000 x developers and i was like but i kept going i didn't judge myself so and then i wrote ultra high performing like with this title right i liked it but it was kind of like eh like nobody's really looking for this title then i wrote ultra high performing developer and like like that's pretty kind of unclear then i was like how to become a 1000x developer yeah like kind of cool power of deep work for developers this was okay i kept going i kept going kept going and the last one i came to was how billionaire developers think decoding the mind of billionaire developers what do you guys think about that title that's good that's a good one right actually i was watching the video yesterday right so like even if you're not a developer you click on it so packaging here's a here's the unfortunate truth but a fortunate truth if you learn it guys you can have the best video on the planet but unfortunately that this one part is actually one million percent more important than what you're actually what you actually say in the video because if i don't click on your video it doesn't matter like it literally doesn't matter what you say in the video it's almost like you don't exist or your content doesn't exist and then this is where it gets advanced julio and you know i i try not to go too much this route because people are like i need this like i need million bullet points and i need to but then what i do is i will and i don't always do this again guys so like to be completely honest out of the 2000 videos i've made there's probably like seven or nine that i've truly truly scripted out okay so i want to make that clear all right like truly scripted out then what i did for this video is i took those bullet points and then i turned them into a script right so like i i wanted my hook to be strong so my hook i was like what if my hook is like bill gates mark zuckerberg ron jeremy what do they all have in common a huge ego just kidding and then i'm like twothirds of them are ultra high performing developers and you see what i'm saying so like a little joke in the start solid hook and then i get into the video um so other than that what i recommend for most people is just some bullet points and then just go i don't think you need a script you can have certain bullet points and then you can address them like i can imagine like when i watched olivia's video yesterday i can almost imagine i would be okay with watching her videos if she even had a notebook in her hand like without doing any editing or cutting and she like if she literally had a notebook in her hand and she had like five points and she looked at the point and she was like okay number one and then she just puts the notebook down and she's like i'm gonna talk about like mentality and why it's so important and then she keeps talking about talk about it picks up her notebook and looks at the bullet point number two and goes ah yes this is the second thing i wanna talk about and then she talks about it the beat drops i don't care i don't need her to even edit that but if she's going through really good content even if she has to look at it i that is pure gold so for me when it comes to scripting it's bullet points and and that that's good for me it's good enough for roasting yeah so i'm picturing i know that you you cut out the poses right uh and that also adds to the to the video itself so potentially like all i would have to do in case there's some very intensive subject that i want to discuss regarding the career of a ceo um maybe i can just look on the script read it jump back say it and cut that cut the part where i'm reading it you can you you can't you can you definitely if you want to have it scripted you definitely can do that um and cut yeah exactly and you can cut the part where you're reading it right but one important thing julia i want you or julie i'm sorry giulio one important thing julio julio giulio julia one important thing i want you to get out of this is don't lose the soul and i know you won't lose a soul in there you're too charismatic and energetic and i love that about you but just make sure that you're not you're not putting the words on the pedestal put the feeling in the heart on a pedestal because that comes through the camera i can feel that when i'm talking do you guys feel my energy on the call you guys like feel something right absolutely yes if i had a if i had a random slideshow and i was just talking about the slideshow would you guys feel the same way yeah yeah obviously no right so that's the important part like you will you want to make sure that that feeling comes across and you want to put that on a pedestal so you may if you have to go off script i go off script so much you know if i'm like if i just have a bullet point and i talk about it and then i remember some other i just go i make sure i'm feeling it like i feel it in my heart it's a truth that resonates with me and then i go there hacks what's up say amen yeah yeah yeah yeah awesome so feel it so it's like the hack few hacks to feel it is if you get frustrated about something it's really hot it's really hard to not feel frustration you feel frustrated it's like one of those feelings you can feel very quickly those are hacks um harder things are feeling grateful about something but like rants and feeling frustrated it quickly gets you in your body and like you can you can experience what you're saying so i keep some bullet points and then i go and then if i feel them the better the video gets i like that all right so now the reason why i like scripting at least a little bit because my my feeling part like my brainstorming mode my free flow talks in very long sentences ah i see okay very very precise so um but i really really appreciate that yep cool got it got it yeah so you can have a bullet point and then go through them and then they'll keep you on track most of the times you know that's what i actually like about that that's why i actually really like slide shows like making like making google slides so it keeps me talking and doesn't give me a script i just have images so like i'll put 20 images of what i want to talk about and that keeps me on track without even needing a script and it's visually cool for you guys because you get to see like what we're talking about now so yeah little cues for yourself would be great and it keeps you on track the whole time and then you can just like boom move to the next part um as soon as i feel like the value is not there anymore i very quickly will move to the next point that's valuable i have like this crazy value radar that's just like like value value like and then as soon as i start detecting this is not value it's kind of like what it sounds like in my head is you guys know like those new cars now when you're like backing out if there's something around you'll be like right or when you're turning and like beep like crazy and it gives you anxiety you're like what the hell like what's happening i'm not even close to anybody so like that starts going in my head as soon as i'm getting away from the value i think that has come from uploading 490 plus videos on just one youtube channel plus probably doing over like 500 lives um countless coaching calls so i have like probably over 1000 to 2000 like videos of me like speaking so over time i just developed like this really strong sense and as soon as i feel like i'm on tangents i go back but it's a dangerous area because you i also want you to be in your heart and not too much in your head so micro improvements every video don't over judge yourself but you'll improve over a quantity like long period of time think about like developing a skill like guitar or skateboarding or biking or whatever it will take a lot of repetitions i believe that you can't get quality uh without doing quantity so just do a lot of it and do what you're feeling with the script and i think you will get so good at it bro uh hi kazi would you would you like to review my youtube channel uh it has like five six videos do you have one minute time to see who is this uh i'm sure okay we went over you so give me one second i wanna address i'm gonna go with stacy and a few others and then maybe at some point i'll do the roasting of the youtube channels or reviewing of the youtube channel is that cool um and and uh you good with that answer absolutely okay beautiful all right thank you so let's bring on so stacy i see your hand hi how's it going does somebody want to help me spotlight oh awesome thank you somebody's helping with that beautiful go ahead so i guess my question was um since this is about the making that of that one thousand dollars i wanted to maybe get some insight on whether or not you got your first 1000 just strictly from youtube or was it from other sources my first uh so okay that's a brilliant question thank you for that so let's go and look at the truth i love just looking at the actual truth so i want to go here you guys can see that let me go i think january so this is where i did something i'm going gonna share with you guys in a second we're gonna get a little bit advanced is that okay if we get just a little bit advanced guys sure i try to yeah yes all right yeah that's fine i'm always like man i i don't wanna just everybody be like oh my god this is so crazy all right so um let's go to january all right so right at the start of jan i remember like new year's day what i decided to do was i sold a product i sold the product like i i came up with something and i'm like people are already following me for programming what if i had something on programming that maybe went deeper and gave more value but i could charge 47 bucks for it okay so i sold that thing that thing that day made me uh i think twelve hundred dollars whoa yeah okay so in one day yeah that was huge that was huge for me i was like oh my god i was losing my mind now that number is not twelve hundred dollars that number is a lot more but that those days it was it was that so that is how i broke my first one thousand subs uh one thousand dollars okay and remember we talked about there's 14 15 different ways we can make an income stacy yes for me i recommend like making a channel on what you're good at or what you like wanna sh whatever it is that you're like providing specific value on and then maybe one day you can sell a course i think that's like a really good solid way to go about it um it doesn't and so for me that's what i did i decided to sell a course um and i that's how i broke my first thousand dollars okay um and this is the part what's up you can also do affiliate marketing yes i will click bank yes you can there's a lot of that stuff you guys can do just one thing with me guys everybody has their own ways of going about it for me i like to recommend build your own brand like build your own brand affiliate and stuff like there's so many ways to do it there's no but like for me it dilutes your brand and your message you end up sometimes like the la there's lack of trust because you're always trying to sell other people's product and then you're dependent on other people and so if those people decide to not be your affiliates anymore for whatever reason i believe in like make something valuable and then sell your own thing i think that's the best way to be the most profitable um what's your friends of income so i have a question when you have a moment uh okay one second so stacy does that help at all yeah definitely helps yeah i like that um that you you mentioned branding and i think that's very important is really um once you get that confidence about yourself and what what value you have to bring then that's when it really hits home that you can build your own brand yes i think that's good here's the here's the tricky part about the confidence um if you wait if you wait for permission to get that confidence most of these things will never become a reality that was one big difference between me and my close friends where we started out and then i built something and they didn't or they couldn't um so like here here's a crazy part right stacy if you don't have if you don't start trying to believe in yourself or like that i can do this or i'm gonna start working on it now you're not going to make those videos and you're not going to make them like with your heart as much because you're always like looking for permission they're like i don't have enough permission right now to uh be really confident my videos are like really deliver my all really deliver my value that's gonna make guys what is what's going on if we can just mute the weird sounds uh okay thank you i checked everyone somewhere okay cool so um so you have to almost be delusional a little bit and just decide to believe in yourself today okay see what i'm saying like is it okay if i just decided to believe in myself today is it okay is it okay with you stacy so yeah don't and that's good because yesterday when olivia talked and she was like super motivated and i was like yeah i can do this i'm gonna show my face so i hope you can look at my video and roast me if you have to yeah i think i did i showed my face this time okay perfect i love that i apprec that is amazing so selfesteem is such a big part of this game i want man uh i can get technical with this so okay i'll get a little technical with this so we have money right like let's say we let's say we want to make money so the closest thing to money is what what's one step that happens before i like if you wanted to build a brand or sell a course what's the thing that happens right before there's actually the money hits your bank account what's the step right before value value i i believe that there is something that's actually demanding closer than that you guys are going further product who said that uh kayla yep so product is the thing that comes right before you get money because you can't even if you wanted to pay me stacy you can't pay me if i don't have a product okay right what comes so like you literally cannot like if i have a product on a page you can pay me and buy the product or the service so that's what it is now what's the thing that comes right above the product right before the product what gets you to my product in the first place excitement excitement interest interest yep yeah so the youtube videos and the content is actually the thing that gets you to my product if you hadn't viewed my content you wouldn't get to the product if you don't get to the product you don't get to the money see what i'm saying so there's money right above money's product directly above money's product directly above product is content and what's above content this is where it gets tricky what's above content what's the thing that happens before content happens ideas ideas inspiration inspiration execution right just starting so i like to put i'd like to combine all of those things inspiration whatever all of those things right who are what is it the thing that brings inspiration what is the thing humans humans passion right like humans is the thing above content if you don't have human if you don't have a person or talent you're never to come up with those inspiration or the ideas or making content you see what i'm saying so all the way at the top is like you that's where everything flows from the human is the per the actual person comes up with the content then product happens and then money happens right the slowest and the hardest path the quickest path to getting to money is working on your product right this second right there's a quick like literally uh if gilberta is just like here's a product here's my link go buy this right now and he just drops it in the chat that's the shortest path to him making income he can get to see what i'm saying but it's very short term we'll very quickly probably tune them out maybe one person will buy it but like everybody else will just we're tuned out so product is the quickest thing to work on the thing that happens above it is content now it's harder because a slower path to getting money but it's a really powerful way to get to money right and the thing that's way harder than that and takes even longer is working on yourself working on the actual human the talent for me right now what that might what that means is hiring people and the actual training the people for you what that means is working on yourself working on your inner confidence working on your guys's selfesteem working on like the belief canceling the other noises that are stopping you from doing this the validation that you're looking for that you won't get ever you or you might get it like hundred thousand subscribers in but you're not gonna get to the hundred thousand or one thousand subscribers if you don't give it to yourself today okay right if people are waiting to get permission to make content when they like most people don't say this but they think this how many of you will how many of you have went to your youtube channel and tomorrow it had 100 000 subscribers how many of you will actually start taking youtube seriously and start making content raise your hands right if today you got to check for 20 000 for you like hey you should do youtube how many of you will start taking youtube seriously that's a real thing problem is you're waiting for that that's the problem that's why you're not doing it today that's good i i started my channel a couple of days ago when you start this journey and i have i think four subscribers give me give me give me one second give me one second stacy are you you good yeah i'm ready for my roasting whenever you're ready but yeah thank you for answering that okay awesome you got it for the spotlight guys if we can only make one person spotlight so not me it take out you can take out me as well you can take on okay all right okay so um i'll go with uh devon hello causey it's me again um so kind of just just just one thing before i we get into your question uh you guys you uh does everybody here know this is a fiveday youtube challenge that we're doing yeah yeah okay and everybody here knows that there's a call happening for day four tomorrow i didn't know that okay i know now okay cool um i mean did you guys know there was gonna be a live stream happening for tomorrow like day four yes okay cool so like yeah so tomorrow we're also gonna do this call because it's so much more fun to do this call than the i was like man i don't like just looking at the comments like i actually want to talk to the people i want to talk to you guys like i'm having a million times more fun yeah exactly although a million times more fun like actually communicating with you guys right now so we're gonna be doing a call tomorrow at the same time okay 11 a.m pacific so mark that in your calendar uh because i think a lot of people don't know about this so this way you and i get to have that oneonone so take advantage of it take maximal advantage of it awesome thank you for this opportunity will you also share the zoom link for tomorrow um yes i'll try to share it through email i'll try to share it through the text message and maybe even in the facebook group but facebook just does an awful job of letting people know that there's anything going on we have 3 700 members and like only 40 show up to the facebook live calls like it's not telling anybody about the call so it's really like frustrating but i mean i just enjoy zoom so this is super cool i'm going to be doing a lot of this i'm going to set up a whole system actually okay sorry question about question about that meeting tomorrow yeah because for for today's zoom call uh you know the whole meeting id and everything actually came in like 15 minutes after 11 a.m um is there a way that we can have that meeting id and the passcode like before 11 yes yes yes yes it's my fault that it happened after that because i just randomly came up with the idea and my team was like what the hell you're doing a zoom call now we have to change everything i'm like i want to talk with them i don't care let's figure it out guys so so sorry about that but tomorrow it'll it'll happen ahead of time okay and will we get that link through email uh you guys will get it through email and text uh if you guys join that texting platform like you if you guys sent the text when you guys join the channel yeah yeah so then it'll happen to your phone as well email and phone okay guys i'm gonna go into devon's question now all right devin go for it all right so based on what everyone's kind of been saying as far as finding the motivation or content like i've all those things are good but the main thing for me that i'm having trouble focusing on is well looking into the webcam for one and two uh the energy because when i'm talking to you on zoom or you know there's a group of people there's a certain energy and then when i'm recording by myself and it's just me in my room in silence you need to work okay you i'll tell you because i already know you um you need to work on becoming happier it's like once you like this is a hard thing to think about and this is a thing that's like oh like this is crazy but like i just want to go to the deepest thing because i already know you so i have rapport with you everything else is going to be temporary dude like literally every other solution is only going to be temporary like if you're going to be around me and this energy temporarily you're going to keep going up you're going to want to make content you're going to want to do this as soon as that energy goes away it's going to drop so like the and the best way to actually have that is be around people who are like sillier come off like stupid laugh a lot and have fun like get to that you have like a child in you and i know that right so you're very smart you're very deeply analytical you're very thoughtful but that can also lead to overthinking for you yes or no absolutely right sometimes instead of being in your body you're sometimes in your mind right also you have a child in you and i know that you can like laugh at the dumbest things and have fun yes or no yes so you need to like love that part more and feed that part more like it's a really weird answer because it's like has nothing to do with youtube analytics but like the more you actually feed that like even that part where you're laughing right now the more you make yourself happier the more you're going to want to do this so like tactical tips i can give you spend more time around people that are just like stupidly happy all the time where you're like you have no reason to be happy like you just got up today and they're like oh i know yeah like be around people who are just happy that's like the best thing i can share with you like actually spend time with them what's gonna happen is you're gonna start coming up and then at some point it's going to start becoming your normal happiness leads to just like the most insane amount of action like you can force yourself and use discipline but it's like temporary like you could brood for like you're gonna be angry you can punish yourself and be like what the is wrong with me why am i not making videos there's something wrong with me come on you can yell at yourself all day temporary so i don't want you guys to get into that pattern it's a shortterm pattern that works but it's like being in an abusive relationship you know it's like that person you found really attractive but they're awful people but you decide to get into it and then it's just like a nightmare getting out of it and it gets abusive so it's almost like i don't want you to develop that pattern or for people to develop that pattern of themselves where you just yell at yourself to do it because then you develop a bad relationship like even when shazada was here he was like i'm lazy that is gonna if he keeps saying that language you know he's like i'm lazy with making content i just need to force myself and push myself he's gonna actually start not enjoying making content because this is to be like trying to force himself to be disciplined he's going to start being his own disciplinarian dad which we all know what happens when you just have a purely discipline iranian father mother you start running away from them like as a little kid like for me when i had that sometimes i would start running away because i was like i don't want to deal with that you'll start running away from yourself so what's important is to like it's a weird answer but i really do believe it that like yes you can plan out like i know you don't have you don't have a problem with planning content right right you know even what to make it on do you know what i'm going to make after this call yeah so so i want you to pay attention to that you will make one after this call and latch on to that like that emotional when you get that emotional push when you feel your energy going up latch onto that like a hungry dog behind the meat truck so like make the actual video you take advantage of it but then what i want you to actually work on is like literally physically smile and laugh more throughout the day like literally you know how when you look at your phone and it says you use instagram for four hours today i want you to literally be able to sit down at the end of the day and be like for 47 minutes i i couldn't stop laughing today hard like that much like where you can almost quantify the amount of time like how much happy you are if i go to sleep and it isn't a day where i laughed so hard that i had tears coming out of my eyes i'm like damn man i gotta work on happiness more like so really like be happy and do that like watch comedy watch stuff that you like what's gonna happen is while you're planning stuff out about making content another tangible hack is you can watch content about making content so like that's gonna excite you about making content the biggest thing is like overall raising your levels of happiness but being around happy people listening to happy things your level of like what you actually produce in your output will go way beyond like that's the actual solution to what you're looking for that is crazy and i believe that's the correct answer at the same time so i'm gonna okay i didn't know this this took an interesting turn but yeah i'm definitely gonna do that hey beautiful are you gonna make a video right after this yeah because i got an interview at two and they sent me some questions to prepare on and i was just gonna do a video basically going over this list of um questions guys how amazing is this guys how amazing was this right now like what you just experienced with him i want everybody to just give him a round of applause like we actually want you to do this bro like this is awesome like whoa oh you got this most random uh therapy session ever yes but i appreciate it yes yes i'll invoice you after okay discovered by my insurance is fine paypal request clever programmer therapist llc what is this new company um but i so like like when you're motivated about something latch onto it i believe that with everybody like understand that it's coming from external source but latch onto it it's important that you latch onto it don't just be like oh you know what it's not coming from me like i'm gonna we're all a product of our environment we're all a product of our environment if 50 people around you and your family work out you're going to work out 50 people around you eat potatoes 24 7. you're gonna start eating potatoes like we are really a product of our environment so you're here you're excited now what happens if you feel excitement and energy if you guys feel that right now maybe now is the time to actually set an implementation intention for when you're going to shoot your video all right now are you guys feeling some type of energy right now are you just feeling some type of like little tingling sensation motivation hope something that you can do in the future uncertainty excitement any of you guys feeling that raise your hands says right if you guys feel it like frank i see him like smiling a little bit right like i see it in clara i see it in you so what i want you guys to do right now is let's use this moment to commit to actually making something like shooting something today all right i want you guys to shoot something today so then you guys can actually bring it tomorrow and we can take a look at it cool guys are you guys with me on this yep can i ask a question on that beautiful uh yes go for it does this here apply to talking to an empty room yes talking to a camera is always talking to an empty room i mean i have an issue with that they're my own so i'm like him talking to an empty room is a problem with me i'm used to having an audience yes yes so like that's the hard part um when you don't have an audience on the other side there's nothing feeding you energy and so just like who am i even talking to but like i know that you have a great imagination i know that like you have that certainty in you so you for you i would say like almost imagine that the audience is there but the best thing i can say is like over time of just doing it it'll get better and trust me ronald the crowd that is actually watching is way bigger than any stadium or any indoor place that can ever fill up and same thing and same thing with the impact that you're making on people's lives i'ma try it too beautiful awesome yeah so if you can feel that you're gonna make that effort then you know that's what's amazing about it and if you feel like you can impact those people like before you even start i want you to feel the impact that you can have by just doing that by just speaking directly so guys let's give ronald a round of applause because he's going to be doing this and i'm super excited for him this is amazing awesome ronald i appreciate it that's awesome brother um please cool remove me from the spotlight because i want other people to be spotlighted not me so thank you um and guys at this time what i want you to do is either say out loud actually i want everybody to say out loud what your implementation intention is so that means what time you're gonna shoot your video okay so if you're feeling that energy now it's time for us to put it in action and motion because outside of that there's no purpose for us being here the purpose is we're here we're going to feel some type of energy let's put it into motion let's put it into action right away you guys with me on this so far raise your hands we're saying yes yes yes yes are you guys with me on this let's say it louder you guys with me on this say yes yeah yeah beautiful absolutely with you right now so right now at the count of three i want you guys to say so i'll demonstrate it okay so for example you can be like i commit to shooting my next video at 2 p.m i commit to shooting my next video in an hour from now or at 6 00 p.m or a 5 p.m does that make sense what i'm asking of you don't say it yeah it makes sense okay so at the count of three i want you guys all to physically say your implementation intention of what you're going to shoot or what time you're going to shoot it makes sense guys okay so at the count of three one two three yo that is beautiful guys wow let's do it one more time let's go one two it up for three that is brilliant energy i absolutely love it so that's your implementation intention okay that's your intention and once we commit to that we're going to make sure that we do that we're all going to do it here yes yes we're all here for that reason beautiful julian i believe you when i see you adam i believe you i know you're in space right now adam but i still believe it this is going to happen i'm at work man i'm i'm trying to do two things at once coding and doing this awesome spoken on iss beautiful so i want to see a video from all of you guys tomorrow okay excellent beautiful where do we send it uh you guys could put it as a comment or when you guys jump on this call you guys can actually bring it with you yeah i have mine in the chat yeah yeah yeah dropping it in the comments or in the chat is a great place we'll make a post for is is on his coaching call maybe nas can help make a homework post for today and everybody can actually like submit their videos to that post okay cool so we'll make a homework post cool guys and then you can actually submit your video there link it there cool that's gonna be on facebook yeah on the facebook group yes excellent it's going to be on the facebook group yep fantastic awesome all right cool so i'm really excited about that i'm glad that the intention is in so now i'm going to start taking more of your guys's questions and then at some point we're gonna start doing the youtube roast as well uh i have a question um hold on i saw i'm gonna go with frank right now because i saw his hand was raised frank go for it yeah no cause this uh this fiveday series thing is amazing i got my i got my mic now so you guys can hear me a lot better um yeah putting out the intention is great i got the energy um i think i get stuck sometimes on like what is like what is something interesting some evergreen content right it's like i don't want to get in too much into the weeds so it's like you know you saw the one i saw previously was you know my ecommerce one like i know that space really well like i can teach that to anybody yeah um but i want to you know do something more evergreen that's like you know relevant with the times um i think that's kind of what i get stuck on sometimes okay cool so a few things here if it's evergreen it's by definition not gonna be relevant with time see what i'm saying trending right so it's like for example if you're doing something that's like right now trending or like meme worthy like it might be really good for now and it's a good way to do it but it's by definition not necessarily content is truly going to be like evergreen forever because it's like maybe just happening in the now okay so it's like imagine if you watched a video and it had like some meme song in there you know uh what's that harlem shake you guys remember when harlem shake was like a crazy thing right um and so if that like when you watch it today it's not evergreen it's like outdated like you can tell it's outdated but truly evergreen stuff there's content that people have made 10 years ago on youtube or they're maybe giving advice or valuable things that can be really really like potentially evergreen now and nothing is going to be like forever nothing is going to be like permanent but you know for example one of the videos that works always really well in the programming world this top five programming languages to learn you know okay yeah so like that could be your evergreen type of content if you want to do something along those lines right or like the top five programming roles like right like something like that that maybe i'll kind of go that direction too because i my gut feeling if you want to crush it on the developer level my gut feeling and this is something that i discovered and i had a hunch and then i told sunny about it and he jumped on it with me was those builds i deeply believed that it was going to be the most valuable thing and it turned out to be truly the most valuable thing they got countless people jobs countless people got jobs from it um you were one of the people that i believe leveraged it to get a higher paying job oh all the way like i'm probably the most successful like off that and it's like i really appreciate it tell everybody here where what job did you have like how much were you making before and then after those clones you watch those videos what was the new job that you got so um previous to the job i was making around 150 um and after doing the the build with sonos like the the guys who make these speakers really highend speakers um i put it on the uh profitable javascript thing too i was able to get uh land 175 000 job off of one of the clones that sunny came up with uh which was the spotify clone so amazing bro that's amazing and basically picked up react enough to do that and then i built a dashboard for them and then i'm also making their app because i'm i'm primarily a mobile app developer and i'm making that in react native so so here's one thing i just knew we were never gonna go wrong with if he can use our video to go from a hundred and fifty thousand dollar job to 170 000 job do you guys would you guys say that we brought him value oh yeah right absolutely so yeah when there's something that i feel like is gonna truly bring value i just know that it's gonna crush like truly bring val so like in the developer world the ultimate hack is just bills there's a lot of other stuff but if you are good which you are dude i will just personally tell you go the route of builds you can do other stuff if you want and you're truly excited for but you're like yo i want the fastest path to like growth and success build build a tesla landing page build uh you know what i mean build like uh uh uber clone with react native build a spotify clone with react native like just like we were dropping like ticktock uh we showed people how to make ticktock right so that's trending it's hot and all of our developers wanted to learn it we showed people how to make tinder we showed people how to make um all of these like amazon like would any of you guys would be interested to even see like yo how do you actually make amazon in one day that's kind of cool right the amazon store i'm interested how do you do that yeah so like that's what we showed like we built all of these things because we're developers and then other people were able to build them so that stupid amount of value i knew that even if the videos weren't the best edited the best this the data i knew that that was just gonna dominate so as on the developer side if you go that route you're just gonna dominate and especially if you're good which you are oh bro it's time to fly and what i will even extend to you is if you want to make content like that we have a channel clever programmer with 830 thousand subscribers i would love for it to be even on there i'm totally down for that i'm totally down for that okay so like if you actually want to do it pick a build and we can build it yeah like i've been telling sunny like it would be amazing to have like a super build right everything from the react all the way to maybe some back ends some stuff yep all the way to the native like all the full stack and that would be amazing and that would be so like pick one thing like you know whatever you want to do it on spotify tick tock tinder whatever it is pick one thing do the video however long it is and then if i think instead of even doing a live you can do the video you can record it and then like just put that out i think that's gonna do really well and if you want we i'd be happy to put it down on our channel too because coding related 100 yeah and and yeah all prerecorded you know just because like some of what you were saying like for me doing it live is not not usually an option because of you know because i'm working on it yeah yeah um but um but the idea the idea is i want to provide something really good value yeah um i think i'm going to pick up that sony um blogger vlogger camera that you were talking about it's really handy awesome and uh yeah let's produce some content man i'm i'm totally down for that that would be sick that would be really really sick i'm so excited about that bro uh jump on it i think that's uh that's one of those opportunities that can be just truly lifechanging uh it can give you a head start into you making content and helping people and our number one goal is always to like even in 2021 our number one goal is to help 5 000 developers get jobs and we document that every time they get jobs we document that and yeah and and getting mobile mobile development is a huge it's a huge thing too and a lot of people want to learn it i get questions like that all the time i'm like how do i become a mobile developer and stuff and i coach people and i talk to them like just for free right but it'd be good if i was like hey let me show you let me show you how to make instagram or show you how to make an uber app for real for yes beautiful beautiful i'm down man let's do it awesome awesome great so there um you know hopefully that give you guys something with like you know with insight into how to think about content like sometimes sometimes if you can find something that you deeply believe and know that it's valuable like truly valuable they could just use it man that is usually one of the best routes you can go like for example one of the best routes i can go is like share like even right now what i'm doing is is this right now what you're watching like is this edited is there cool music happening are there cuts is there anything that's fancy about this yet why are you still here we've been here for two hours and a close to two hours and eight minutes why are we here why are you still here wow excuse me because we have a passion for it and we want to learn and we want to just absorb what we can yes you have a commitment to absorb you have a passion and then now there's value for you right that's why you're like you're staying here because you're getting value right people if you're not you don't care about anything except like if you're not getting value like i'm out of here right like sometimes my dad will be talking and i'm like man this guy's going on a tangent how do i get out of this call you know but then i'm like dad let's talk about something else so like that's the important part if you can truly have something that's valuable that's usually just a great way to go about it um i'm gonna take a question from aldo okay thanks uh that's this is a great and i was thinking about making two uh or three channels because i love technology yeah um stuff like anthropology because i'm an educator so do you think that i can make some uh work about it in those three fields what is it that you love topology anthropology anthropology what else and developing as a developer and technology the first video that i will do is it's about technology it's about you use an ipad yeah to study and i think it's great but later on i will talk about anthropology because it's related to education uh but do you think that it helps to have two or three channels and keep feeding those two three channels and to see uh no no so okay i have a i have different answers on this okay so most people don't even have bandwidth for one channel right like most people don't have the bandwidth or the ability to create ad volume or at scale or do it justice even at one channel right so uh doing three like even we have 15 plus employees a clever programmer and even this is hard to produce do a second channel i'm now starting a personal brand channel right rafikaze that's where you guys are are at i have a youtube called rafikaze so like oh wait hold on uh which is actually exciting i want to actually take a look at this am i about to break um let's see give me one yes you are 988 i guess wow look at that 997. oh wait hold on you guys can't see it so let me actually show it to you guys my bad i stopped sharing but uh about to break 997 uh i mean about to break a thousand subscribers so remember i talked to you guys about how to break your first 1000 subscribers guys yesterday isn't that cool that i'm doing that in real time right now so it's not just yeah if i should go subscribe to him so he can reach us they're like we should subscribe to him so it breaks a thousand thank you guys that was not my point but i really appreciate it thank you that's not why i did this so let's go smash the subscribe let's go um man so oh i was waiting for uh nine nine nine and i just because that's amazing same thing i was waiting for 9.99 yeah what people keep doing is they keep uh when you play this game with people if you do it live they keep unsubscribing so then they can be the one to like do the thousand subscribe and i remember i was like seeing this i was like oh my god people would keep unsubscribing um yeah so although what the hell were we talking about i'm sorry yeah about delivering into oh cool but i think that i'll i will try to mix technology and education yeah like for example you can make apps on anthropo i don't know bro like anthropology app you know and then like infuse the passion or you can give anthropological like um examples when you're talking about programming so like infusing it i think is a good idea i think just the bandwidth required to make three channels grow is really really really really it's like if you're like you know i want to have uh i want to have kids but like i don't know which kid is gonna be the best or like how i can have like a really really great child so let me just have triplets right now and then like let's go and uh like they're all gonna be and then whichever one is great like i'll just go with that one like don't have triplets right now bro it's going to be really hard i'm saying so i appreciate that that's that's what i would say it's it's hard it's like yeah so and i loved your chair and your likes oh thanks afraid that's awesome yeah yeah this setup took freaking years but i used to sleep under like i had a my whole channel was built when i was in like a 400 square foot office like a tiny office and i would like it would be always so heated i would always need to put like napkins under my armpits because it would just get so hot and there was never air and we would work we would work like 15 or 18 hours and like i would sleep under the under the desk and then i would wake up and then start the next day i had a home i'm not trying to like make a sob story i could have went to my parents house like my house but like i just worked so hard and loved it so much like i didn't care i would just like sleep under the desk wake up and then like start shooting videos and i'll be like let's go like so you know it's just yeah i just i grind it really hard you don't have to yeah you know but i just did it that way so coming here and having this i i'm so grateful for it every day you know i never take the setup that i have right now for granted you know because everything was made in like out of nowhere you know so um it makes me appreciate everything all right aldo that answers your question yes yes okay brother thank you for coming on appreciate you all right we'll go with yazid uh i cannot hear you so you might have to click the mic and make sure you're on zoom okay now hey here we go we got a content creator in the house i already know you have a ring light you got the good mic going that's great that's great start you got a great smile i love it thanks yeah so i want to ask you about do you think it's good to talk a native language or an english for youtube programming whichever whichever one you want do you want to have a if you want to do english but it's not really the best one like i feel i could make some mistakes so um if you're doing it out of insecurity if you're not doing english one out of insecurity i want you to do the english one in that case especially in that case because my biggest thing for all of you guys is your selfesteem and confidence growth that youtube allows you to have like that's the biggest gift that it can give you okay um so uh it's just a small uh thing if you can watch your video it's 30 seconds so it's not very long okay if you can't give me like any feedback okay how about this we'll start the um we'll start the roasting session slash review sessions now is that cool with you guys if we start the review sessions now yes okay i think everybody's been waiting oh okay yeah yeah i didn't know that was okay cool all right so let's start with yazid let's go so uh yazid you want uh decaf light roast dark roast what are you looking for dark groves like dark rocks give me everything all right give you everything okay got it okay all right all right we're gonna give you dark roast on this one look at the cute little thing yes okay oh [Laughter] hi guys today i'm going to introduce myself to you so let's start i am is i'm 15 years old okay don't panic i started loving this field since i was don't panic i love it i'm sorry i know it's supposed to be a roast just give me a second i don't think but in this range web and mobile development oh dude all right okay i'm gonna have trouble roasting you but i'll do it so first of all i don't really care who you are if i'm if i'm coming to your channel if i'm coming to your channel i don't give a who you are okay okay i'm coming today it's too dark it's too dark i'm coming to watch something that brings me value okay so make sure make sure you put the value proposition first okay what i get out of it as entertaining as and as energetic and loving your personality is i want something for me because i'm about to watch a video and there are a million other videos um so that's one now okay you are so good that like it's really hard for me to do more dark like dark roast uh but but yeah that's my biggest concern okay for you which is okay just make sure you give the value first and then worry about yourself later outside of that i want to kind of get to the good parts you have i mean you are built for youtube like you are good i could like i felt left from your confidence and smile and energy when i just spoke with you but this video is like an actual youtuber if this channel had like 20 000 subscribers or 30 000 subscribers i might not be like surprised i might be like oh no i expect this channel to have a lot you see what i'm saying yeah um myself to you so let's start good job with the music i would lower it a little bit so i can hear your audio better i am i'm 15 years old okay don't panic i started loving this field since i won amazing job on the brolls amazing job with the brolls like we need to learn this broll in our company if you were old enough i would hire you like like we're not doing a good job of brolls our brolls are garbage we don't have a lot of brolls it's just like me sit standing there and talking if we added this it would make our videos million times better so like you're already on the broll side you're better than me and some of our editors in this team that are like actually amazing so great job on that what's in this rank so when i say broll guys what that means is it's not just like it's um it's images and videos with his voiceover in the back you guys understand what i mean when i say broll like this says aroll this is him just looking at the camera and talking today i'm gonna this is called aroll this is just you looking at the camera you're talking right now this with his voice over but videos of some other stuff playing it's broll make sense guys yes no yes yeah yeah and i don't remember specifically but in this range web and mobile development are the fields that i like and work dude you're going to crash apparently what meanwhile i have two apps on the play store this guy has two apps on the play store that was yeah well then killing it man you're gonna go far man all right what's the legal hiring age where you're at the description new videos every week 1916. okay uh you already have 342 subscribers yeah um the story behind this channel uh i made multiple videos but just one day i woke up and found some motion guy hacked the channel oh all the videos got deleted wait how can somebody hack your channel dude i don't know like my password is really so long do you have siblings no yeah i have do you have any older jealous siblings of you i don't write data let's start with the family first so no kidding so like nothing ever got deleted on my youtube bro and people know my youtube you know so like i would i would are you giving out your passwords to random people no it's like i changed them and they are very long yeah like it's hard to guess them do you have they are not related to me do you have any do you have any like do you have a hunch of who who it could be i feel like this is getting interesting it's from russia i got the ip address oh maybe they were using it he even put his nose maybe it was your brother maybe it's your brother using a proxy everybody knows how to proxy right vpn okay cool so uh the only reason i'm asking that is i don't want this happen to you later so enable twofactor authentication okay okay so if you have two factor and then like change your passwords you change your passwords yeah okay cool so you'll be fine you're a developer you know what you're doing thanks just like yeah thank you so much now on this video the what i will say is good job i think even the thumbnail is actually looking good so great job on that um this thumbnail i don't like at all yeah it was just for uh uh desktop letter installer no that's okay yeah yeah sure so what i want you to know is like try to make your thumbnails the simplest way you can make good thumbnails is by making them less busy just more like really simple the less you can have your you can't go wrong with less you can go wrong with a lot on your thumbnail so like here there's a lot that you're trying to do with this thumbnail like you literally just took like some the whole page and put it on here so when i look at it immediately i'm not gonna click on it if it's in my home recommended right how people watch videos is they go to their youtube recommended right a lot of you are watching your videos by based on what youtube is recommending to you right right in this field and then you click on it so if i see that image i'm not gonna click on it because it looks like a it looks like a pamphlet it looks like a flyer like a marketing flyer or something you know so make it less busy um if you can add your face in there you have a great personality with the smile have that and just have one word like flutter or something oh okay right like i would have here's how actually would do your thumbnail okay so um do we have a photo of you all right let's see um i do want to be mindful of time so i want to make sure that we don't actually like go too crazy with this but let's go and um just another thing bro uh an easy way for him to create uh thumbnails is using canva yes so canva or you can use photoshop so like this i know this is not the picture of you that we're gonna be using i know this is like um you know this is this is a small just an avatar photo that you have but honestly even a thumbnail like your face in it with like flutter logo so like let me go here and go flutter like this logo right yeah with like literally some text underneath it flutter like weird colors all kinds of craziness happening but you're already much better and like people are more likely to click this then they are likely to click the other one that has too much on it okay okay so like i would i would have a good i would choose a good photo of you here so it's like full screen kind of like that right on the righthand side and a flutter does this is this starting to look like kind of like a regular youtube thumbnail yeah see what i'm saying so this is kind of what you want to do you want to like keep it simple image some words done simplicity will get more clicks more views more whatever all right um thanks so much yeah so at this point i want you to just go all in bro like for you now it's just time to go all in and start making tons of content i'll start to speed up the roasting because otherwise gonna take too long okay hopefully you got value out of it yeah thank you so much all right awesome who's next who's the next one guys please don't spot him don't spotlight me all right who's spotlighting me david david amanath which one of you spotlighting me okay please don't spotlight me because i only want one person to be spotlighted okay so like the person who asks the question i want them spotlighted i don't need me spotlighted thank you okay okay you wanna go with my one i'm sajida um okay let's go uh i will i'll put my channel name in the chat okay uh zoom set yeah try to drop the links but okay cool okay yeah i will i will i also posted the channel uh url perfect that's way better thank you yeah all right so let's go here and we're gonna go fast so if you guys have no i might give you a lot of feedback really fast because i want to speed it up so if you guys want to take notes and then implement then go ahead and do that okay cool uh and what type of roast are you looking for decaf you can give me any kind of information so i would like to know okay all right cool so um just off the cuff um okay good a little bit better good no and no okay cool so those are the just just off the cuff thumbnails all right now i'm gonna just look at titles and uh these are all your videos yeah yeah yeah okay cool so now i'm just gonna look at like titles and stuff like that okay this is valuable because you're teaching um how to create a package convert a video like i like i like value so every video that you have is it seems valuable so i like that uh this is all about you and it's a promo so i i kind of i go away from those things but other than that like i like all of these the direction you're headed in um is there a specific video you want me to look at uh you can probably uh look the last one yeah this one actually that is my latest video still six hi everyone welcome to my channel the destro dev show today we'll talk about array.prototype.flat the only thing i would change there is i would uh reverse the order i would say what this video contains first and then i would talk about my channel this shows me that you're thinking about yourself first and the audience second it's a big mindset shift that i want you guys all to change audience first you second or if you can you last okay uh whenever you guys have a conversation with somebody which type of person you enjoy having a conversation with the person who speaks about themselves the whole time and then asks you or do you guys enjoy your conversation with somebody who listens the entire time which person do you guys enjoy more go ahead and just say it out loud listens yes we're thirsty to be listened to right same thing here value first your thing second let's see the code first good you get into it so fast this was like the best that i've seen out of all the videos we've watched i mean we only watch one person's video but like i like how fast you're getting into the actual value by doing it is flattening the nested so the video is like really early i want you to keep speaking and using your emotional human energy to guide me through it almost imagine like a slide right the more momentum i start picking up in the start then later the momentum just keeps taking me right so or like think about a car going downhill like in neutral in the start it's hard to push the car but then it just gets going yeah so you're you're deciding to put a lot of your quiet parts in this here in this area right there that's too that's really dangerous in this part is the part where you actually need to push the car okay this part is already rolling i'm already addicted and hooked and watching so even if you are quiet here i'll i'll be okay see what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah yeah so like you're quiet you're just typing um yo frankie what are you up to yo nas what are you guys up to right now oh you want to grab some food let me just watch this video for a second um all right bro let's go grab some food you see what i'm saying like you lost me bro like literally i can have a conversation with somebody i can talk about grabbing t i can do texting on my phone so like you need to hold my attention you need to be speaking the whole time so an example of it would be like first right let's get into it so guys right now what i'm going to be doing is we're going to flatten the array so let's create a variable called flatten my arrays equal to myarray.flatten my array if you guys hit tab it will auto complete it do you see how i'm using my voice to energetically keep you going through it yeah it's energetically keeping you going through it yep if i run and your audio quality is really good this flat method you speak well and clearly your screen is looking great and you're using zsh the same thing i use that's good but do this and run if i do this it will be basically the same if we want to flat if you want to make videos that are extremely direct and to the point look up fire ship and look up cory shaffer if you just want him direct to the point model the pace of cory schaefer you'll notice they're even though their energy is lower but their pace is really fast then that too there is cool so good video those are my notes for you okay let's move on to the next one look at mine uh okay awesome one second one second guys i'm looking also at the chat so the next person that dropped their thing is muktum um hussein are you there if you're not there in part like if you're not there i might have to skip you i want you to be actually there okay so yuri let's go with you okay cool okay i already like your title yeah sharing your screen bro oh my bad so only i'm liking the title i was still stand corrected oh okay intro is too long nice dude she's got like trap music playing and everything yes that is sick the number one and the most fascinating reason is that you can convert ideas into reality okay so great i'm loving it um you got i you're gonna do really well because you're the type of person so you're ready like you're actually a type of person that people want to listen to and follow okay so i haven't played a lot of this video so not a lot of people will get a sense of that but i know you your words hit hard and like you're just you have like a leadership thing going okay not a lot of people have that people maybe are good conveyors of information but you have leadership going you can literally make videos just like this for a hundred videos and i would not be surprised if you're like 50 000 subscribers just yeah like a little bit short on my android phone actually my sister was holding the camera for me yes people literally want to follow you because you're they want to actually be like you and they want to have that mentality and they're like you have something that's the really valuable part about you so you just need to keep the camera on and speak more like and you're good the only tactical things i'll tell you is your music is too loud and it it drowns out your voice i can't hear you over the music so i so like whatever app you're using you need to bring your music down to like negative 12 decibels or maybe even negative 20 decibels your voice should be zero or 12 decibels positive and it will it will create it so your voice pops out okay so don't make me compete between music and your words then i will start listening to music intro good job on the intro you have a really cool intro i would make it like one second long like so okay i'll tell you like right when i get bored of it okay i'll tell you like right when i want you to switch it right there okay a second longer and it's like it's painful to me like almost like oh so four to five seconds too long cut it good so that's my tip to you other than that your title is looking great uh i like your channel oh my god and you got the thumbnail game on point you just need to make more content you just need to make more content um just another thing bro uh like what i've seen on yeah clear programmers content like when you're going through the title like you're actually speaking in the background and the slide like the title comes up and there's a slight background music like you don't like speaking right you know yeah yeah so you could do like what yeah yeah so you could do it both ways so amana brought up a good point like you can keep speaking the title uh and have it playing or you could do what you did if you do what you did you got to keep it short that's what makes it clean so like for example i'll show i'll show you um an example of this okay so let me know that top five programming languages right not that one but i i uh i you already know that one but i'll give you a different example of an intro so like in these videos i'm doing an intro right and i want you to actually pay attention to the intro so for this video i'm going to play oh i'm not sharing my screen oh okay okay thank you thank you guys so for this video i want you to watch how quickly the intro happens okay i'm really did you see the intro sequence yeah yeah yeah it's just a few seconds i get my signature that's part of my intro where it says rq is a frame it's a fraction of a second it goes so fast that you can't even see my actual like uh let me like i can't even pause there i literally cannot pause there even if i wanted to but you guys see that little rq that happens really quick so that's so when i say the intro it's like from here it's hard to let go until whatever but like just it's just short i'm really that's it so i i recommend making intro just a little bit shorter outside of that great video you just need to do more and you'll you'll win okay so like uh what's your suggestions on the thumbnail is it right like your thumbnail is pretty good your thumbnail is pretty good um let me actually tell you if there's something i find annoying about it let's see um i think like it's a little busy so like i would just maybe remove this like this okay like that the dude at the bottom right uh the apps coming out from the phone at the bottom left okay if you want to make a really good thumbnail like a really good one you looking at the computer and coding and just the image of you from the side like an image of you from the side coding generally is like the best way to do it it's the simplest and it works really really well outside of that great thumbnail good job okay thank you guys okay cool all right um let's go zach carson ultra dark roast please zach where are you at yes i'm right here are you ready for this you sure you want this yep i need it all right okay cool let's get into it so we'll go with zach uh i'll share the screen uh i love that song that's like literally one of my favorite songs it's awesome well i love them i like that song okay so let me actually just go to your channel first i'm going to go to your channel i'm going to switch to this um how how long ago did you start okay one year ago all right all right you know what you're doing like on youtube it seems like you know what you're up to like when i look at this it looks like somebody who's who understands how youtube works they haven't done it long enough so like why are you not making more videos like why is your last video like five months ago and there's like months long gap in between them why um yeah that's kind of like the problem for me is just like finding finding the time trying to like put out content i mean there is time but like trying to like prioritize well it's not important to you then it's not your priority okay yeah like to me all this means is like when i see this is i know what i'm doing i spent all this time learning it but eh it's not a priority i don't feel like it's important okay i can't want it for you do you think it's important for you yeah like you actually want to do it yes i do why why do you want to do it well i mean to like give other people um like i i know like whenever i watch like music videos or something you know it just like kind of helps soothe me you know just kind of like it's soothing it's nice and relaxing to watch yeah but so you're telling me you want to do it right yes but at the same time you're lying straight to my face okay because your words are telling me you want to do it but your actions aren't so you can be the sweetest person on planet earth and i can love you i love your energy but like i don't want you to look at me straight in the face and lie and i don't want you to look at yourself straight in the face and lie okay if you wanted to do it then you would have been doing it tell me tell me certain things you like doing that you do on a regular day like just tell me a few things that you do throughout your day like what's an average day in zack's life um i like to edit videos okay what else um i mean obviously play play the piano okay great what else um i mean that's usually what i focus on i mean but what are the things do you do do you scr like do you not scroll on facebook or instagram or youtube dude like texting your phone he's a big time consumer okay youtube is what you like consuming youtube is what you want to do and if you told me that that's the truth because you're actually if i look at your phone i can see the time you're investing in there yeah if i actually look at the time you're spending playing piano you want to play the piano and it'd be the truth that you would be telling me because you're actually doing it if i had a hidden camera there would be x hours of footage behind it right yeah so youtube doesn't seem like something you want to do okay that i just have to call you out on your on that like you have you have talent you have the skill to do it why are you not doing it that's the thing that like i need you to understand and i want me and everybody here to understand like why are you not doing it you say you want to do it but you're not doing it so why is that i guess i just have to want to do it more you know i guess that's what it is okay and part of wanting to do something more requires you to do what um i mean put forth work i guess maybe right maybe put forth work yeah yeah maybe put forth time and energy into it yeah and actual hours behind it okay right so like that is the last missing piece of the puzzle here it seems like you you enjoy it it seems like you get it it seems like you have a knack for editing and you enjoy consuming content and there are a few things that tell me you enjoy consuming content one you told me when you tell me you're spending hours consuming content i spend hours consuming content another thing that tells me you consume a lot of content is i'm looking at your thumbnails and it tells me you have an eye for what's happening out there and what works now the problem might be you might be spending too much time consuming content yeah i i feel like that is the issue right so there's too much outside noises in your head instead of you going internal and creating stuff okay internal requires you to go inside and stop outside all right creation is a really weird thing it happens from within yeah okay when you're playing the piano and you're feeling yourself you know what what's happening at that moment it's just silence in you nobody around you saying anything in your ears you enjoying it and you're feeling it right there's a certain energy that's there like right now you're thinking about it you're smiling you're feeling happy you're in your flow state right yeah your hands moving and hitting the keys at what shows me you're passionate about it the work that's the work right yep so like you have to take your wants that you want like i had one team member a while ago on my team and he came up to me and he's like hey i want you to pay me more i said okay that's great um i'm like i'd love to um why should i pay you more he's like i want to help my parents and when he started saying that he started crying tears coming out of his eyes he's like i want to help my parents i want to change their lives i want to like make more money so i can help them blah blah blah he said all these things yeah i looked at him i had tears coming out of my eyes what did you think i said to him zack hmm i would think yes i looked him in his face and i was extremely sad and i looked him dead in his eyes and i said you're lying he wouldn't be coming in at 11 30 strolling in to work 11 30 a.m when i'm the ceo and i'm starting work at 5 or 7 a.m right he wouldn't be leaving before everybody else leaves like he wouldn't be you know like and so that's the thing the actions are the truth you can want something you can feel emotional about it but like if people who have done you can't lie to them like yeah so like you have to treat yourself the same way don't lie to yourself either because it'll start with yourself then your boundaries will get stretched and everything will just feel fine at a certain point like yeah i want to do youtube i want to do this on and then like it's you start to spread your own boundaries of what you can do and what you can do even in a relationship right if somebody wants to be in a faithful relationship with their partner right and they're like i don't want you to cheat on me and it's actually one of the boundaries in the relationship and that will end it that's a fair enough boundary right for most relationships yeah right well what happens if you go ahead and cheat anyway and she lets you come back and be in the relationship or he lets you come back and be in the relationship what is that that's stretching the boundary that's stretching the boundary right eventually what happens is that your partner's selfesteem goes to negative 1 000. selfconfidence drops to negative 1 000. and then you're you create a codependent weird relationship that has no boundaries and right and so just it gets downhill from there same thing we start doing with ourselves we're like one we want to do youtube then we're like all right we're gonna do it then we do it and then we like stop doing it and we say we're and it happens in many many other areas of your life it's not just happening in youtube bro it's happening many other areas of your life probably right now where you're like there are things that you want to do and you like mean to do and you know they're going to change your life but then you get on them and you stop them right so it starts to become a pattern and so that's what i want you to be careful about because you have so much potential i can see it in your eyes i know you have so much hunger but now your work has to actually match it or you need to be called out on it and you need to call yourself out on it with love with love with the with the beautiful smile like you have right thank you but truth and the actual work yeah okay i agree so you know when you check next week and the amount of hours you spent scrolling on instagram or youtube or greater than the amount of hours you spent on your own youtube i can't help you there's not a single soul in the world that can help you okay yep okay so what are you gonna do as a result of this conversation i'm going to make sure i don't you know spend too much time you know just like not overdoing the whole um youtube cool so not doing is a difficult vague task it's not clear oftentimes we lack clarity not motivation so like if you pick a task that's vague it's going to be difficult to actually execute on it because what does it actually mean right like maybe you're sitting there and you're like does it mean i don't just use it in the bathroom but then i can use youtube when i'm like outside of the bathroom waiting in line you see what i mean so it's like it's not clear so like let's set a clear goal of like maybe not even a gold something you're running away from let's maybe set a goal of what you want to run towards okay okay is that fair enough yeah what can you run towards what is one action that you can do and i don't like to think about actions a week from now that's because that's just not gonna happen or that just tells me that you're not serious about it and you don't want it right okay so what's an action that you're gonna do to make sure that you're actually focusing on youtube right after this zoom call is over shoot a video that's what the i'm talking about guys everybody give him a round of applause that that is money right there okay zach and okay so like right now that came to my mind go ahead like since he's doing a piano right it's not about something programming or anything it's piano what he can do is like just simply just do a time lapse like since he plays piano every day he can just simply record that and upload it on youtube you know yes that's a fantastic way to start okay or okay what i want you to do is the only thing i want you to add is when the video starts just be like guys i'm going to be playing the cover of xyz and then just show me the you actually playing it okay all right that's what i want to see from you i have so much hope for you i have so much faith in you because i can see hope in your eyes and i can see that smile and it lights up everybody's day here i just want you to put in the work behind it because i'm desperate for you to actually get the results that will follow after you put in the work all righty thank you okay i love you dude so much thank you so much for jumping thank you for this opportunity i really appreciate it got it beautiful all right thank you all right awesome so do you guys enjoy that by the way yeah that was again the darkest but the lightest rose that was somebody has echo going on so maybe yeah okay there we go thank you thank you thank you thank you i appreciate that but yeah exactly it got really quiet in here because we had one of the mods uh mute everyone so i got quiet so if you want to speak again you can unmute yourself and then mute but yeah it's funny thank you guys i i'm glad you guys enjoyed that it was like dark roast mixed with like love and so you know he wanted he said to me ultra dark roast so that's what ultra dark roast looks like like it's we kind of get in there okay so if you're looking for that um then we can get into it so um it's it's a work we're both working here i'm working you're working like we're not taking you know there's no timeoffs here all right cool so i'll take um let's see here who do you want to take next uh stacy did i go over your stuff yet no i think she's amused okay so i'll go not yet i'm ready okay stacy so let's do it what type of what are you looking for medium media okay medium got it all right here we go hello dance i'm about to pop a squat right here guys and get ready to tell you a little bit about putting together this algebra app today nice great intro okay so yes i would remove the uh again i'm gonna again i'm gonna try to go fast so like if you guys have to take notes you can if you want to i mean this video is going to be up there anyway but if you want to take notes it's more internal as you can i would remove this thing because it's confusing and i don't know what it is i would just like not have it ever in any video ever again i'm coming to you live and in person i love your energy i love your smile i love the way you speak i want to see your face in every video this time um i want to give you an introduction on this channel since this is my first nice good music great music i would lower it a little bit so i can hear your beautiful voice over the music extremely clearly okay stacy okay first video and i just want to um get to know you guys we don't want to be pill and paddling with this additional subtraction you've got um you have your buttons and everything import so that's the module that will be great so now that you're getting into the technical stuff i'm loving it nice you're making a tekinter app with python i love it great uh i would reduce the audio i'm sorry the music by a lot i'm loving how you have yourself here so a lot of you guys are doing screencasts guys your personality is a gift stop hiding yourself um you so like put that like you're the ultimate asset so use it you know like seriously use it like i'm i'm so crazy about like selfesteem and all this stuff i think it's the most important gift that it can give you making youtube videos and stuff and then how it plays out in a like over your entire life is just massive right like you start developing low selfesteem then you have kids then they develop low selfesteem and then your daughter is dating somebody who's abusive because your daughter can't put boundaries because she doesn't have selfesteem like it plays out in really awful ways use youtube to like boost up your selfconfidence and selflove and praise and reduce judgment on yourself learn to look at yourself and be happy right like learn to look at your face in a video and like actually stop judging yourself so there's there's such a beautiful opportunity for growth here internally like you know and then the external results will follow too so if you want to do it selfishly like how do i make the fastest money or subscribers the same way like if you actually work on your selfesteem and all of that you're gonna get the most amount of sales the most amount of youtube views the most amount of followers you know because people want to follow people who they would like or who they want to be like so that's the fastest way to grow so i would i don't know if this thing stays there the whole time stacy if it stays there for a limited amount of time that's okay i wouldn't leave it there the whole time okay um i like where you are at here and coding that i love um i would somehow figure out a way to maybe increase a resolution on the screen is it a windows laptop yes windows okay well yeah okay cool all right nice job with the comment below i love that you're giving me a reason to engage you're giving me a ton of value i like that you're annotating on the screen makes it very clear for me what to do um the only way the only way i would improve it is i would remove this pop code maker stuff i really don't know what that is it stays just for so long um and i would show your app in the start so like we're gonna be making a calculator app with python and then i would actually show i would recommend showing it in the first five to nine seconds okay other than that great energy great video great job nice job let's give her a round of applause guys oh that was a good medium real stick yep you got it you got it awesome thank you for jumping on uh okay let's go misha misha misha um are you here misha yeah or is it meecha how do you say it okay yeah actually the full name is michael but just because okay cool here we go um guys let's keep spotlighting okay so i spotlighted okay cool so here we go i'm gonna take a look at your page now okay um and what type of roast are you looking for light roast medium rose dark roast what are you looking for or anything espresso okay cool actually i i started this channel today but oh yeah nice good job that's amazing yeah awesome three hours ago i see it all right so let's see here so i'll just start spitting out what i think and then you if you want to take notes go for it okay okay um oh so this video is about how to download high quality videos from youtube okay cool yeah um so i would so like nobody cares about this because they don't know this so i would not have this being there at all okay your face is already here so you're the brand so you don't need to also have this so like this is great and you got a beautiful face so just that's perfect right there i would remove this and i would make this much bigger okay um i would make this white text much bigger so it takes up like maybe a lot of space like this okay um and then i would just have like a youtube logo so if i if any of you guys yeah i mean if you guys want to go really far with it you guys can sometimes even send me a thumbnail image and then sometimes i might just make something on the fly to give you an example but yeah i would i would have the youtube logo right here like that i would not use pink background because it makes it hard to read i would use like a black background or a white background and then i would have the text like download youtube videos for free something like that or just like download videos so the less text you can have the better on a thumbnail okay that's crazy other than that great thumbnail and then let's get into the title is good how to download high quality videos from youtube easy two ways for free so title is good nice great start today nice today what i'm gonna be talking about i'm three seconds in nice smile standing in front of the camera talking confidently good posture from youtube in the first step i'm going to show you how you can eventually i want you to invest in a mic right now it's okay just keep going with this youtube software to download video from youtube and in the second step i will show you how you can use a third party software what i like to do in the start of the video is just like pop in few things so for example if you say youtube pop up the youtube logo right here like an image that's it right then when you say download uh drop a download image you know like a logo of download and what download looks like just drop that right here and maybe just like text come up comes up right here that says download you know just for a few seconds while you're talking as you say those things to download videos from youtube in this twist i will show you how you can download a high resolution and high quality videos great on youtube i know the tricks i'm going to show you will blow your mind off nice i love that i know the tricks i'm gonna show you're gonna blow your mind you're like also foreshadowing what's gonna come you're keeping me excited for what's to come that's great so let's get into it so this is the part where you're gonna lose me and a lot of people um just speak this you know it's not a slideshow so you might lose people with so much text don't have so much text just see you can speak this part also it's really hard to read this it's really hard like to use font that's easy to read because this font is very like weird all right guys okay so yeah resolution is really hard to see um like you see what i'm talking about like it's really hard for me to read anything really hard so uh you gotta do it in a way where i can read stuff so i would work on increasing the resolution when you export the video because it's like really hard to read okay cool um other than that great job you're dropping valuable content you got a great thumbnail i would just improve the video uh video quality okay that's the number one thing i can give you great job awesome give him a round of applause guys awesome job awesome awesome awesome great great okay cool um who wants to go next oh wait okay let me see we got joey we got zach elson let's go with zach because i don't think i did anything with zach elson um camera on perfect beautiful there's zach nice sitting sitting with vimhoff i like it let's go medium roast all right medium roast cool here we go it's like people want the dark roast um okay cool so here we go we got managing anaconda environments okay great i mean it's hard to go wrong with technical content you it's like that's what i love about technical content like it just works because people like need it it's kind of like needing medicine you need medicine you know even if the receptionist isn't the best you'll still buy your advil because you need your headache to be gone or something you know so like technical content people just need it like they need water so hard to go wrong with it i would thumbnail is a lot going on so i would what i would recommend again is an image of you on the right side and an image of anaconda or jupiter or something on the left hand side generally that's what i recommend it works really really well it's just the easiest and the cleanest thing stay away from so much text on your thumbnail there's tons of text create a new anaconda environment load the kernel into jupiter anaconda individual edition tutorial python3 python data change like there's a lot of text in this whole thing is tons of text so i would simplify it by just having your face a logo and one word face logo in one word generally is like one of the best cleanest ways to do it all right let's go into the video hello and welcome to you where i try and break down data analytic practices into easy to understand and digestible bits a great intro fantastic intro to hopefully make them a little bit simpler you may have recently installed the anaconda package for machine learning or data analytics nice but you don't really know where to start you may have seen something about anaconda environments but don't really understand them yep in this video i'm going to try and do a simple straightforward look at managing the environments and how to use them so i like that where he's like empathizing with me where he's like hey you might have downloaded it but you might have been confused about what's the step that happens next yes always whenever i dealt with anaconda uh because i'm in the code like i'll you know i'm a developer so like when i was learning programming i always had trouble with this so when you say that it is great great and slideshows you can't go wrong with them if you guys have slideshows those videos do really well why do you use the environments or so really a lot of time being quiet i would change that i would make sure that i'm like now you're taking me to really black screens psychologically and emotionally for a human being it's not very fun to look at this how many of you guys are like your eyes are having fun looking at this it's glazed over already yeah like a developer so like uh this is why in my videos i try to even make my terminal look like it's fun right like when i turn my terminal as ton of colors and it's like exciting to look at um this is exciting to look at this isn't so if you take me to this at least use your voice or talk or do something where it's moving it otherwise i'm you're gonna lose me around here so just to create your first environment so my feedback is the start is really really good i love the slides and i love how you don't just completely start the technical part right like away you kind of wait a little bit and you warm me up to it and then you get into it i would just increase the energy just the quickest hack i can give you is increase your energy and like literally even if you start saying what you're doing helps so all right guys we're gonna work on this boom and then if you're really messing up or really slowing down it really just doesn't have any movement to it you can add really light music in the background oh wait other packages oh you're here at the bottom right what the i didn't see you there so he's right there um if we want to let's say so i would put me like much bigger or you know um some were visible you know so like i would put myself where like because then you give me you to look at so i would put it here or here but bigger you know much bigger because where you put yourself nobody looks there you won't be seen i'm just trying to not cover the code and so i wanted to make sure i was out of the frame you'll be fine you'll be fine uh and in editing sometimes if it you do really block it you can move it a little bit in in like you know in post you can move yourself for something so um but you'll be fine there's usually not that much happening on that side of the screen jupiter notebook so let's go ahead and close it other than that good technical video just keep making more okay okay great job great job um okay let's give him a round of applause guys zach nice awesome great work fantastic okay who wants to go next who wants to go next i'll go next i own act let's go okay all right i'll open up your video so the older ones i just used for like social proof and the two new videos are kind of what i'm trying to do oh this is you oh dude this is gonna be a good one thank you i spent over 1 000 in collectibles and i'm talking about sports cards and comic books i mean yeah you're gonna win but the pokemon type that's going on right now with celebrities like logan paul and logic starmie two cards left charizard you're doing it on something that's trending extremely relevant it's very entertaining so far i was hooked right in the start did you guys feel you were hooked right in the start yes yeah so i have a confession i spent over 1 000 in collectibles so i have a confession i spent over 1 000 in collectibles four seconds in i'm hooked i'm talking about sports cards and comic books but the pokemon now you got gary vee and a simpson reference so like now i'm in because i might not know you i might not even pay that much attention to pokemon but garyvee and other things one hype that's going on right now with celebrities like logan paul and live when you do logan paul i'm in i know logan paul i watch his i'm in and then you throw logic so that's another big one for a lot of people so guys this is called borrowed authority like even if you like if you start your video and you start talking about bill gates and melinda gates and like tony robbins and steve jobs like all of a sudden i'm paying attention to you because you've almost borrowed their authority social proof because i'm like oh this person is going to say some relevant stuff because i know those people it's crazy but it works starmie two cards left hit the notification bell it's the best way to awesome support this channel and allows me to give you guys as much free value as i can every day and what type of roast are you looking for bro um harsh as possible i'm really just trying to like improve as quickly as i can like i i think i can be good at doing youtube videos but just anything that could possibly help me grow faster is what i'm asking for um okay cool so let's go here yeah the older videos are more for like social proof that i used to film back then so i don't really count those as good quality content and then if you can maybe give me like some marketing tips possibly i'll be very helpful if anything can i say something sure yes i honestly from the look of it i think it's pretty good channel and his video would be like if i was to watch it be very entertaining to watch that's just like from my perspective i think he's doing a really great job yes thank you i'm gonna continue off of that so uh ioneck um your biggest problem here is um you have you made two videos yeah so you are you're like one of those channels that's gonna blow the up you're one of those channels i appreciate it thank you what i would tell you to improve in your videos improve your video quality because it seems like you're really shooting with a webcam which you you probably are right webcam yes so i would improve the video uh the video quality uh what are you doing for the audio your audio sounded decent uh typing out uh notes on a notepad uh for the i'm doing a yeti yeah your audio sounded good so your audio is good your it's your video i would improve but don't make that a thing that stops you from making more videos okay so keep going um outside of that dude you are gonna kill it you just have to keep going there's no marketing tactic there's no strategy there's no hack there's no youtube ad thing that i'm gonna tell you that's gonna you have to just go you have to keep going like for example right even if i run youtube ads to my youtube channel it's gonna temporarily flood traffic but that's not going to do then it just ends so like i might get 4 000 views but then it just ends the way you actually grow on a platform is if you make good content for the platform that by itself keeps growing if your is dependent on you having to go to facebook groups to promote it it's never gonna grow it's temporary does that make sense so like um as advice from you you just recommend just having patience from what i'm understanding and just kind of just just hustle them right it's called so i will give you the ultimate thing okay you want the ultimate secret to it yes please okay it's called the magic 70. i want you to write that down on your paper right now okay the magic 70. my notepad yeah okay this is the most important rule that has helped me and is with guaranteed results like i i have had this rule for not just for myself and all multiple other people even my clients that helped them grow to like over hundreds of thousand subscribers and they've done millions of dollars of revenue and started from complete zero the magic 70 rule is the ultimate thing that has had them be successful and me be successful okay what this rule is and i'm going to say it in a harsh way but this is just how my brain thinks and it's just like shut the up for 70 videos and just go for 70 videos just shut the up and do the actual work 70 about 70 videos in is where you'll start seeing breakthroughs it might happen earlier it might but 70 videos is like i don't look at success when i look at people's channels i'm not looking at do you have 71 views you have 150 views you have 5 000 views on a video 10 000. i'm like did this person produce 70 videos what's the goal like look at the actual make the number of videos your guys's goal if you set a goal like subscribers or viewers it's so random it's not in your control do you guys does that make sense guys like for example if you set a goal of having an eight pack somebody can genetically a lot of people on the planet can't genetically even have a eight pack so if you set a goal that's in numbers and subscribers you're just bound to be unhappy set goals on in terms of your process set goals in terms of quantity and then hit those goals and you will dominate so your guys's goals should it be i want to get to 2 000 subscribers by the end of this month i'm gonna your goal should be i want to make 15 i commit to making 15 or 30 videos this month see what i'm saying so that goal is actually going to be the thing that leads to the ultimate results the the processbased goal so like for you if you have a lot more videos and you're going you're gonna crush okay ionic i want you to commit to something here and i want you to think about it but i want you to give us a goal that you commit to for the month of not even december not even something far off in the month of november how many more videos are you going to produce i want to um i'm trying as best as i can because i have like a business i'm running on the side but i try to make a goal to at least do one video how much okay so this business that you're doing on the side what is it why you're doing it how passionate you are about it and how much are you making from it uh for that i so i used to sell like tours and stuff when i was doing that i was making around four grand a month and for this side business with flipping cards and everything else it maybe comes out now i'm taking like a small pay cut of like two grand a month just selling in person but i'm trying to scale up and use the uh youtube platform to basically do my marketing to sell some sort of product it's just a lot of hustle work and ground work that i understand that i know you went through and it's like a shitton dude it's like 6080 hours a week so it's tons of tons of work in the initial beginning that i have to do but to get to your uh answer your question i'm planning on doing at least one video a week if i can have more time opened up okay i'll tell you this if you sucked at videos uh and you had a long way to go i would tell you just do your other job as much as you can and do this within a very limited amount of time you're killer at videos i'm not saying this to blow smoke up your ass or whatever and i also don't want you to just listen to it and just be like oh now i'm not gonna do anything with it what this means is you need to lean into this as hard as like no it's not a matter of if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen like i'm not literally i'm not trying to motivate you like my goal here is not to motivate you i know that this is gonna happen because i see your channel and it's actually good videos good thumbnails the videos dialed in go the other way bro try to maximize this as much as you can give up the short term cash for a little bit this will be the fastest explosion to your revenue goals or whatever goals you have right now you're making two thousand dollars a month is that what you said yeah two thousand with no job just selling um how much how much do you need to just purely survive every month um i i try to aim for three to four that's my thing how much not even a goal how much do you need to just pay the bills and like eat food and 1500 1600 okay like little less than two do whatever it takes to make 1600 and every single other second i want you to just put into this 100 they're so close to blowing up you don't even know it but just like going to this hardest dude like seriously thank you yeah thank you very much all right brother awesome love it take care um okay let's go with yeah um ionic we didn't get a chance for this but drop your intention for what you plan to do this week as a result of this conversation so like set a specific goal in zoom chat and if somebody can amana you can read it out loud once you see it um i want to see you actually taking action on it because the the worst thing is hearing something feeling something and not like actually taking action on it that's the worst thing so um set some kind of intention for this week so then you can actually put it into motion all right let's go with um who is okay caitlyn i'll go with caitlyn and she's dark roast all right caitlyn you're up oh here we go hi here we go i saw you like wake up i saw you like do everything then you're like started driving i saw you drive like i mean i've been through your whole day already like we've been doing i've been running around the whole day yeah it's like it's like a vlog um joining with me yeah there you go so let's take a look at this i'm gonna click it and uh let's uh and i'm gonna hit share screen in just a second here we go oh boy how's it going guys my name is kate and i'm going to be talking to you guys about codecademypro and big question we all want to know why there are so many outlets right behind me is it worth it just kidding just kidding okay so hey so okay you want you want a dark roast but i will i will just do what feels fair to me okay okay so start how's it going guys start is great there's something with your camera is it like is it not focusing on your face like is it out of focus it was um a transition that i thought looked question i guess it's questionable but it was a transition that i added no no no no like i mean like even right now it looks like it's not your face doesn't look like completely in focus frankie am i making this up doesn't look like yeah it's like there's something oh you mean oh is is it so not a transition you mean like you added an effect to make it a little blurrier or what no in the very beginning i added a transition but i don't know about right now it shouldn't be blurry do you guys feel like the face is a little bit blurry you guys yeah i think it's focusing on your hand motion okay um now it looks a little bit more in focus actually so not not the end of the world okay let me actually give you what i think i think fantastic energy i'll let you know nice i like that we all want to know i would project more your voice you're a very kind person and i can feel like you're soft like you're softhearted and like you're a little bit quieter on the quieter spectrum i would project louder okay okay thank you because i want to hear your voice you have a great voice you have great personality great charisma i would project louder academy pro and big question we all want to know how's it going guys my name is kate and i'm going to be talking to you guys about co pro i like that right in the start you tell me what's going to be happening so like i'm i complimented that about a few people's because the worst thing is like not knowing what's happening right in the start um the same thing i'll tell you is that first four seconds i would swap it them first right like so so you say hey guys i'm you say who you are first and then you address what's in it for the audience address what's in it for the audience first so swap okay it's a little mindset shift but it's actually a really deep level shift because um essentially you're thinking about yourself first an audience second and then it comes out in your video not again not um any of this stuff like i want you to hear me because you're a very kind person so when you hear my things you might actually take them really to heart so just understand that i'm it's micro it's a tiny thing okay so just a little swap bro and big question we all want to know is it worth it i'll let you well cool let's all get there it's okay caitlyn i love it you have to do it you have to you have to do it you have to own it you got to keep going and you got to keep doing it more and more and then there will be one day where the timing is right and it punches in and punches out at the right time so like little hacks i can tell you so like you did a joke and you want to make it land so what like the big props i'll give you is you actually executed it so great job on that okay so you have to thank yourself for that later you'll start learning how to actually make it land so like for example a few things that can be happening is you can keep playing the music and you'll be like what's it worth you can take you can pull out the music when you're saying was it worth it oh see what i'm saying another thing you can do is you can punch in so like when you're editing you can zoom into your face more for that one bit so you're yeah see what i'm saying so the whole point of your joke is it's a pattern interrupt right it's like so guys today we're going to be talking about codecademy pro and the one question that we all have on your mind punch in was it really worth it stop like stop the music punch in as soon as my joke lands punch out start the music again just that you see it oh yeah that would that would totally that would sell it a lot better right so just little things but the biggest thing you have to thank yourself taking the effort and taking those shots okay so let's go back cool i would fasten up just a tiny bit because it's a little long especially if it's in every video it ends up taking a lot of time here is my personal co academy pro um and but they um so i would recommend you get a yeti mic yeti pro or yeti some type of yeti i'm imagining you're using your laptop's mic here it was actually some like it's called like an irig i think it was actually a mic so oh perhaps i probably wasn't close enough though oh okay pretty cool this cute little quiz okay okay that is part of the free version as well so one thing i don't know why so here's one thing i'll tell you sometimes people like that mic to not be in the video actually what i think is i think it's actually cooler that for the mic to show like i actually think it's cooler i actually put it you guys see me with my mic right like i actually enjoy it i think it makes the video look better um so all right okay so yeah i was trying to hide it right so if you're not feel free to put it in the video if you want audio quality is more important than video quality so 60 emphasis i put on audio and 40 on the video so that's why on ionex video i'm like okay with him using a webcam because his audio quality is good and then his video is good so like i don't really mind it that much like viewers don't mind it but if your audio quality is lacking it's like this uh it's distracting because especially if you're trying to teach me something technical i don't want to like fight to hear you and understand what you're saying i'm an engineer back end engineer a lot of background noise i would uh yeah full stack but i just had so much fun great personality like you feel it like what you're saying you're like i just had so much fun doing it i love that because it takes me through what we're doing i hate when people are just monotonous and just like a machine i personally it stops me from going these challenge projects are openended projects where they pretty much i think that your channel if you go it it it can be one of those like landmines that can blow up few things i would change about it um if you and i are friends and we're sitting and literally we're sitting at like the lunch table or the dinner table i'm just looking your face and i'm like yo what do you need to do to make your video just work and hit home few things audio is probably the best thing i can give you like get it today you have a nice apple watch i know you can afford it so get it today um get a yeti it won't cost you more than 70 bucks it'll be here today if you get it with amazon prime or by by latest tomorrow so the first thing yeti yeti mike i would keep it up close so i make sure the audio is good i would put the gain almost on zero you guys see how close i am to my mic like i'm making out with my mic you guys see this how close i am to it it's important for you to be like audio quality is so important it helps you actually pay attention and get through it so make sure that you're up and close to your mic and i reduce the gain to zero that way you guys won't hear that hum and hot like the background room noise oh okay gain to zero yeah i put my gain to zero i just like literally just kill it completely you can have it a little bit if you want but i just say get closer and speak like that and so i would add audio outside of that i would have you speak just either a little bit louder um and that would be good sometimes there are pauses that are happening that are a little bit on the longer side so either you can edit that out or you can just work on improving your energy so like engage with me more and tell me more jokes so keep it going or get it then sit afterwards and edit like you don't have to go crazy edit every single pause you could edit some of like the big ones out that you feel like reduce the flow to slow down the flow of the video okay other than that yeah i'm pretty bad at talking so no no don't say that you're good at talking you're really good oh okay why does it say there's no videos because i only have one oh it's unlisted oh yeah i have it unlisted just because i i still have to fix my channel and upload the banner and stuff okay so here's the most important part of this journey where we come to okay we can't move forward on this call until this one thing happens but i want from you caitlyn so i want you to go right now and please make that video public really without the banner and all of that yes yes oh okay i can do that right now cool like really right now okay like yeah like really right like literally like we're all waiting on you and we're looking at you no no pressure no pressure well you're lucky i had it open okay i just made it i made it live oh you did did i i think oh okay i was gonna play some music let's see okay so share there wait what i i reached wait it's on mine what is happening we got scammed i don't see it no it's on mine i did refresh many times probably cash oh thank you for subscribing man why can't i oh my god thank you guys why can't i never see this video hold on i need to get to this video it's very important for me i have to see it i don't believe anybody they could all be lying um can you link it can you link it again caitlyn oh i see it i see the channel hold on one second now we're gonna take a look at it oh it got 11 views hey hey let's go guys give it up for caitlyn all right caitlyn nice thank you guys so much yes we love it um and i'll subscribe to the channel i think some of us have subscribed to the channel i'm going to tell you something and um this is important okay did the world explode when you hit public i mean kind of in a good way though you all liked it right there we go so here's the crazy things we think that hitting public or publish is kind of like hitting like a detonate button and there's a lot that happens it's like weird how anticlimactic it is like nothing happens when you actually hit public like literally nothing happens like i've made so many videos there was never a single time a really cool thing happened when i hit public it's always like literally like crickets it's like quiet and i just hit public okay i guess publish now okay moving on so um sometimes you'll put on a pedestal what i want you to for you caitlyn like in terms of the dark roast i'll give it with love for you the most important part that i want you to work on is like just you have a great personality of a great charisma you have great energy i want you to stop beating yourself up i want you to work on the little phrases like little tiny phrases like oh like i don't know how to talk like ah you know what i mean more love for yourself less questioning hit publish and just move forward okay like how did you guys think how was her video guys if you guys liked her video just let me know like would you enjoy the video just make a sound of you enjoying the video like whoa was it awesome like clap how was your video it was good it was good great it was awesome it was awesome i subscribed right thank you so right now right now it's good because you're getting like social validation from us but i want you to not need that okay got it because you're not gonna have it most of the times and if you pay too much attention to our social validation then you're also gonna pay attention to the negative validation like the negative side of it okay so i want you to uh for creating i want you to go extremely internal and don't look outward so for example if you have an idea just get excited about the idea then just make the idea then hit publish and move on never um i'm a big believer and never redo only iterate and improve this okay so like never remake this video when i get better ever okay never ever ever you might have a you might think you want to delete it you want to make no that's going backwards right like when you learned how to walk your mom didn't like remove your memories of like you not knowing how to walk before that it's just an evolution it's an iteration every day you become a bet like different better more evolved version of yourself that's how your channel is going to be it's a very living and breathing thing but you have to accept all those moments where you fall off the bike and eat see what i'm saying so like yeah just hit publish go on to the next one any improvements you want to make never go backwards move forwards and add those improvements to your second video right okay then the third video so great job caitlyn i'm excited for you thank you so much i appreciate all your feedback thank you for coming on i appreciate you all right guys let's give it up for caitlyn and let's go on to one more okay make one video per week hit 52 videos by the end of the year focus more time into video making beautiful that's great great job ionic yeah give it up for him guys great job ionic that's a great goal i love it um one video a week is a good goal 52 videos when you guys get like when you quantify that's good i want you to play all out but i want you to set the expect like i want you to expect that until your 70th video nothing is gonna happen for you i want you to like in a weird way expect that i want you to play all out and believe that youtube can change your life but at the same time i want you to expect that you're not even going to get 100 subscribers by your 70th video i mean i know you already have 418 but like that's how i want you to think then what happens is now you've created maximum amount of room of happiness almost like everything is going to make you happy and keep moving you forward you can't do better than the best that you can do would you guys agree yeah i agree but because by the definition is the best that you can do so if you set the expectations to negative and then just do the best that you can do you see how much room you guys have created for happiness like everything in between is happiness but if you set it the other way where you're not going to be happy until you get to 10 000 subscribers then it's a very unhappy journey all the way there and then so um process based goals are king all right we're gonna take one more question um what i want to say is i hope that you guys can see how you can get past your 1000 subscribers and hopefully you guys can even see how you can get past your one thousand dollars you could make from youtube it requires you to just keep going there's a bajillion different ways and i'm gonna take on one more person but what i do want to say is like who's showing up here for day four of the challenge for tomorrow we plan out your first one million dollars how to make your first one million dollars from youtube who's going to be showing up here for that right here beautiful i see carla i see um i see max i see aldo frank joey adam awesome ibrahim zach great yeah um and guys when you come on tomorrow please have your cameras on because i'm going to see all of you guys actual faces on here so that's what's gonna we're gonna come start tomorrow at 11 am now i'm going to take one last person okay all right um um amanda you have a suggestion for me for who to take um okay so um what's his name guys just speak up who wants to go next i want to see a few of you and then i'll go next if nobody else wants it i want everybody else to get a chance joey did you go yet hold on ibrahim i'm gonna go with ibrahim because ibrahim i yeah i've i'm sorry joey but i think i've spoken or replied to something of yours on the facebook live streams so ibrahim i didn't get a chance to touch with them hey ibrahim how you doing brother angela alhamdulillah nice awesome you have a video okay cool let's take a look at it nice he knows about that hack so he he dropped the link with the subscribe thing popping up that's cool so um if you guys send the link with with the with it ending in a question mark and this it automatically pops up people um to subscribe i mean it's just a little hack um focus on just making good content like avoid uh but this is good i would do the same thing so cool all right okay um okay so time to we're gonna get into feedback on this thing i don't know this language so french french okay cool do we have english let's see so i know that these are not exactly same translation but for four like gold or amazing businesses to launch quickly in 2021 without money that's a great title great title uh thumbnails you have too much going on your thumbnails so i would avoid that i would avoid like english caption i would avoid adding this logo here um i would this is good and your face here is good that's really good um yeah so less like make it less text okay for your thumbnails make it less it'll perform better you're doing a great job with titles so i think that you got a good idea on what what titles will work oh nice oh nice that's something to do oh man i love the hustle and it's hot right like are you were you like physically hot was there a lot of heat when you were making the video dude i love it a dancer video oh man let's go damn bro i'm feeling some type of way great man this is a great intro uh i would say the same thing that i bet i say to a lot of people i would uh speed up the intro a little bit i like that you're showing me different images with different words and it has this nice like it has a vibe like what i like about your intro is like it has a vibe to it so i can i can flow with it a little bit so i like that it emotionally keeps me going reduce but reduce how long it is it's like 20 seconds i would reduce it a little bit guys did you see that he tells you who he is one minute and 47 seconds in you guys see that yes it's a great way of doing it um you put yourself as later as you can or as last as you can do that all the time and you'll have a great business okay like be the last person to be fed i'll tell you guys something right uh we this year on track to make over 1.7 million dollars i make 5 000 a month i don't make more than 5 000 a month okay like ah like my their team like my team is making some people are making less money than me some people are making more money than me but my team makes more when we have to do everybody's salary and payments increase every single member on the team their pay is increased first let's see what i'm saying so like i will be the last who actually like gets a bump so like it comes out in my business when i'm like making a video and then it comes out on the team like when i actually have a business from it you know depending on whatever you want to do so that part is important so i like that you did that um i probably wouldn't have this like uh thing that's scrolling at the bottom like a news anchor um i mean it just looks too busy i wouldn't do that like if you want to say something have text some text pop up and then it goes away then have more text pop up what you're saying that is better than this like news anchor thing don't do that great and sometimes if you're speaking you can add an image here of what you're talking about so if you're talking about money you could have like a image of money pop up right here yeah so that you can do that too images are better than text okay so more images other than that great intro great energy um great video oh wait is that actually there or is that an image yeah it's an image oh my god that's cool nice that's good try to do more of this stuff in the start if you can try to add more of this in the start so like it makes a video it makes me it tells me oh there's going to be a lot of things that are going to be covered in this video that are going to be awesome so like even when you're introing the video
