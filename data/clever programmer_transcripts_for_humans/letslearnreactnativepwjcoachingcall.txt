01:24 - um but yeah guys carry on from the
01:26 - conversation we were saying we had a few
01:27 - questions came
01:28 - in before um one of the questions from
01:31 - was from a member in our team uh
01:33 - i remember from a community called
01:34 - saddam and he asked even if i'm a
01:36 - beginner
01:37 - should i be in this kind of call should
01:38 - i be in this kind of uh situation right
01:40 - now
01:40 - and i was answering pretty much yes 100
01:43 - and even frank agreed that like you
01:44 - should be
01:45 - 100 in these kind of calls even if it
01:47 - doesn't make sense
01:49 - okay so you want to make sure you
01:50 - situate yourself around people who are
01:52 - kind of ahead of you and
01:54 - there's a rule of 33 which i live by
01:56 - okay and this rule like i promise you
01:58 - i think everyone should go ahead and
01:59 - live by this for one and
02:01 - it's very simple right you have split
02:03 - your life
02:04 - up into into thirds right so i'm going
02:06 - to go ahead and share my screen quickly
02:07 - and we'll start drawing on the screen
02:09 - uh last time i don't know if you guys
02:10 - remember my screen wasn't working my
02:14 - um my setup was a bit broken but now
02:17 - i should yes i have it back last time i
02:20 - had to do all sorts of crazy stuff just
02:21 - to get around that
02:22 - um let me quickly make you guys
02:25 - visible on my screen okay there we go so
02:28 - you want to split your life up into
02:30 - threes like thirds okay so i call it the
02:32 - 33
02:33 - rule and honestly this rule has been the
02:35 - thing which has progressed me
02:37 - deeper oh man goddammit every single
02:40 - time i never learned
02:41 - one thing okay let me do that again
02:44 - 33 raw 33
02:47 - raw okay there we go yeah so this is a
02:51 - 33 rule and basically you want to go
02:52 - ahead and like imagine your day
02:54 - right so imagine like this is your this
02:56 - is your entire day
02:57 - now i want you to split your day up or
02:59 - i'll try and i'm going to go a bit
03:01 - extreme right here and say split your
03:02 - day up
03:03 - into into a third right so you're going
03:05 - to have three different things or
03:06 - instead what i'll do is i'll just break
03:08 - it up into you want to spend a third of
03:10 - your time
03:11 - right you spend a third of it with
03:13 - somebody who is
03:15 - like slightly lower than your current
03:17 - level in whatever skill you're building
03:19 - so remember this doesn't just apply to
03:20 - programming
03:21 - it applies to if you want to get better
03:22 - at content creation videos whatever it
03:24 - is
03:24 - go ahead and spend a third of your time
03:26 - with somebody
03:27 - who is who is not as good as
03:31 - as that skill as you but let's go ahead
03:32 - and start with one that makes sense so
03:34 - spend a third of your time with somebody
03:35 - who is better than you
03:36 - right and not better than you as a
03:37 - person i'm saying more skilled at you as
03:40 - in whatever you want to learn so more
03:42 - spend it with somebody who is
03:44 - more skilled than you in the current
03:48 - domain that you're looking at right so
03:49 - this could be like if you're looking at
03:51 - somebody who's coding
03:52 - then you pretty much spend a third of
03:53 - your time with like a mentor like like
03:55 - myself
03:55 - or find yourself someone who is pretty
03:57 - good with react pretty good as a full
04:00 - stack developer
04:01 - and then what you want to do is spend a
04:02 - third of your time on your own level
04:05 - right now why what do i mean by this i
04:06 - mean if you bought a course
04:08 - for example everyone inside the pwj
04:10 - right now we have a bunch of modules
04:12 - inside the course
04:13 - that is where you're going to spend it
04:15 - at your own pace okay so this is where
04:17 - you spend
04:18 - spend um time at your own
04:21 - pace building the skill right building
04:24 - the skill right so imagine we have
04:26 - coding then you're pretty much going to
04:28 - be spending a third of your time
04:30 - remember this you've got to spend a
04:31 - third of your time with someone more
04:33 - skilled than you in the current domain
04:34 - a third of your time spend it at your
04:36 - own pace building that skill
04:38 - so be doing modules be doing youtube
04:40 - tutorials be watching
04:42 - like reading media articles and things
04:43 - like that because they're that's
04:45 - a situation where nobody is behind you
04:47 - saying you need to do this or you know
04:49 - like this is what you need to understand
04:51 - instead what you're doing is you're
04:52 - pretty much just going through a
04:53 - tutorial at your own pace
04:55 - if it doesn't make sense you can pause
04:56 - it you can kind of wait go make cup of
04:58 - tea come back and then kind of
05:00 - start again you know write down some
05:01 - notes it's all at your own leisure right
05:04 - but that's good but but sometimes we
05:06 - need that kind of like
05:07 - we need that we need somebody to be
05:08 - behind us saying like you know this
05:10 - is like the next level this is kind of
05:12 - like i want to make you uncomfortable
05:14 - and we're going to talk about like react
05:16 - native and redux and stuff like that
05:17 - today right
05:18 - and you might be thinking oh my god i
05:20 - have no idea i've never done this stuff
05:21 - before
05:22 - but it doesn't matter all you need to do
05:24 - is make sure that you spend your time
05:25 - around with that around that kind of
05:27 - a group of people or find yourself a
05:29 - mentor
05:30 - and that's going to progress you the
05:31 - most uh so far
05:33 - fastest and then the third year and the
05:35 - last study of time most people don't do
05:37 - this one
05:38 - and this is to be honest this is
05:39 - probably the the most effective
05:41 - thing is teach someone else your skill
05:45 - right so this really and i used to say
05:47 - teach someone who is like
05:49 - lower than your level or anything like
05:50 - that but i kind of scrapped that because
05:52 - you should just teach someone else your
05:54 - skill even if they're like somewhat
05:55 - decent at coding and things like that
05:57 - teach someone and now you can see you've
05:59 - got like if we go back to the way i was
06:01 - explaining before you have somebody
06:02 - who's above your skill level
06:03 - your you have then you have your own
06:05 - skill level and then you have somebody
06:06 - who is relatively below your skill level
06:08 - or even if they're not it's completely
06:09 - fine and you want to go ahead and teach
06:11 - them now this does
06:12 - many things for you which is actually
06:14 - increasing insanely beneficial
06:16 - it's going to allow you to go ahead and
06:19 - if you can explain redux then you know
06:22 - redux
06:22 - okay like if you can explain react then
06:24 - you know react so it enforces the
06:27 - knowledge
06:28 - right to a whole new level right
06:31 - so this is going to allow you to really
06:32 - kind of like grasp a concept
06:34 - now i can guarantee you if you know
06:36 - about like react hooks or something like
06:37 - that
06:38 - if i went up to you and said to you
06:39 - right okay teach me about reactos
06:42 - right most of us kind of like even even
06:43 - i would have done this in the beginning
06:45 - before i started teaching
06:46 - i would have been like oh uh well i know
06:48 - how to i know how to code it and i'll be
06:50 - like okay show me
06:51 - and you see like you have a different
06:52 - kind of pressure now because it's not
06:54 - like the typical pressure of
06:55 - what we're used to and it's like kind of
06:57 - like somebody's somebody's kind of
06:58 - asking us a test or a challenge or a
07:00 - question now it's like they're asking
07:01 - you to prove that you actually know what
07:03 - you're talking about
07:04 - and think about how this relates to real
07:06 - life when you're in an interview
07:08 - what's the first thing that they're
07:09 - going to do they're going to come up to
07:10 - you and say to you right um can you like
07:12 - maybe prove can you prove to me like
07:13 - what would we do in this situation if we
07:15 - wanted to have
07:16 - a thousand customers and they want to do
07:17 - like uh they want to they want to buy a
07:19 - product and how would we structure
07:20 - everything in this now
07:21 - you have to show them right and you have
07:24 - to get their trust
07:25 - in and and trust in that so they can
07:28 - trust that you know what you're talking
07:29 - about
07:30 - right and that happens the same thing
07:31 - with a student how many times have you
07:33 - gone into a university or some kind of
07:35 - college or
07:35 - or school situation and the the lecturer
07:39 - is telling you something or they're
07:40 - explaining some kind of concept
07:42 - and you're like damn like like how like
07:44 - they're kind of way ahead than i am
07:46 - right like they know what they're
07:47 - talking about because you trust them
07:48 - right because and then what happens is i
07:50 - guarantee they also had a point in time
07:52 - where they had no idea what they were
07:53 - talking about
07:54 - and it's like nobody is born into the
07:56 - world being like a react god right
07:57 - nobody knows
07:58 - react when you when you're one years old
08:00 - right nobody like you don't just come
08:01 - out with this stuff you
08:02 - you have to like you have to learn it
08:04 - and you have to spend time like at your
08:05 - own level building that skill
08:07 - and then by teaching it to someone else
08:09 - you then go ahead and reinforce it and
08:10 - you get much much faster at actually
08:13 - understanding and using that skill right
08:15 - so these are the three fundamentals the
08:17 - reason why i want to start off with that
08:18 - is because
08:19 - honestly like there's a lot of
08:20 - overlooked points here like
08:22 - this one if you how many people in this
08:24 - call right now
08:25 - i'm going to go ahead and quickly bring
08:26 - back the the students how many of you
08:29 - guys in the core right now
08:30 - actually have a mentor that you are
08:32 - looking up to besides me
08:33 - besides me besides nars um besides kazi
08:37 - like
08:37 - do you have anyone else whether it be
08:39 - another student or anyone
08:41 - go ahead and just raise your hand if you
08:43 - have some other kind of mentor
08:46 - dang it sonny you took it away i was
08:48 - going to say nas are quasi
08:50 - oh yeah so the reason why i'm pushing is
08:52 - because i'm trying to make it like a bit
08:53 - of an uncomfortable jump right so in pwj
08:56 - it's given right so like i'm a mentor to
08:57 - you guys so we've got two shower we've
08:59 - got anand
09:00 - um let's go ahead and um we've got imran
09:03 - okay we've got danny sing okay nice so
09:05 - you guys all have mentors right huda
09:07 - so hada i'm sorry if i pronounced it
09:09 - wrong um
09:10 - but uh but remember like guys uh firstly
09:13 - i actually want to ask you so tushar you
09:14 - first
09:15 - how did you go ahead and find and thank
09:17 - you so much frank for dropping that
09:19 - a donation appreciate that dude thank
09:21 - you man um
09:22 - yeah so go ahead and tasha how did you
09:24 - get somebody to to sort of uh
09:26 - uh how did you find a mentor yeah
09:29 - actually it's uh
09:30 - like uh in my firm only where i'm
09:33 - working
09:34 - so there was uh there's a guy who used
09:37 - to
09:38 - part-time consult like he was not
09:40 - working in our company but he used to
09:41 - consult
09:42 - right so there was a time when i had a
09:44 - chance to work with him
09:45 - okay and we you know like we clicked
09:49 - and the way we were pairing up and doing
09:51 - stuff like we were awake till nine
09:53 - three a.m and working on stuff and it
09:56 - clipped around and
09:57 - the way he does uh stuff you know like
10:00 - designing
10:01 - uh architect structure or getting
10:03 - something done or getting some bug fixes
10:05 - right so that was the thing i look up to
10:08 - him like
10:09 - he used to create something new every
10:12 - month after every three months he will
10:13 - do some project on
10:14 - uh this small uh arm architecture like
10:19 - small chipsets some robotics
10:21 - right he will make some uh
10:24 - door locks or anything anything besides
10:26 - you know
10:27 - apart from coding and even in coding uh
10:30 - what he used to do is
10:31 - he used to learn something new and then
10:34 - he used to
10:35 - teach others also that new thing right
10:37 - so that
10:38 - was the main thing which i got you know
10:40 - uh like i was looking up to him
10:42 - like as a mentor and he really helps
10:45 - everybody
10:46 - yeah amazing dude and and and let me ask
10:48 - you a simple question of like
10:50 - since you started looking at him like a
10:53 - sort of mentoring
10:54 - uh getting mentorship by him how did you
10:56 - progress in sort of your level as a
10:58 - developer
11:00 - yeah it actually uh when i was working
11:02 - uh
11:03 - like we had a project and i had to work
11:05 - on the i was working on
11:06 - the old angular project angular one and
11:09 - then we have to
11:10 - suddenly move on to new angular like
11:12 - angular
11:13 - latest seven or eight version right and
11:16 - it was a move to type script and i was
11:18 - not much
11:18 - aware uh like i've not never worked on
11:20 - it and i was like feeling you know bit
11:22 - scared like it's difficult or something
11:24 - like that
11:25 - right uh then he was like you know i
11:27 - have done it i'll teach you know
11:28 - everybody yeah then he conducted a
11:30 - session like for three four guys
11:32 - he called uh him to his place and he was
11:35 - like i will teach him there is any
11:36 - daughter your short introduction
11:38 - and then the way he explained you know
11:40 - and then i caught up with things and
11:42 - i was uh like i grabbed it and i'm
11:45 - working
11:46 - on that you know my latest angular for
11:48 - new project
11:49 - so that's really amazing dude and that's
11:51 - it like all it takes is that initial
11:53 - sort of jumping and it can be scary like
11:55 - it can be somewhat of a thing like
11:57 - you know like you might be wondering
11:58 - like oh am i going to sound stupid or am
12:01 - i going to like say something dumb
12:02 - because i used to be in the same
12:04 - situation that would be a job and i'd be
12:06 - like
12:06 - i don't want to say the wrong thing i
12:07 - don't i you know in the beginning you
12:09 - have this perception
12:10 - that you're not allowed to kind of go to
12:11 - the seniors or
12:13 - for some reason that there's just kind
12:14 - of a war between you and the seniors
12:16 - and it's not like there's nothing that
12:17 - you can pretty much go ahead and just
12:18 - you know
12:19 - jump into it so that's amazing thank you
12:21 - for sharing that dude
12:22 - um we have another person who actually
12:25 - raised their hand
12:26 - so we actually had imran anand nice go
12:28 - ahead go go for it
12:29 - and how did you meet your mentor yeah so
12:32 - i
12:33 - i met him uh through a discord server
12:36 - actually there were a few groups of
12:37 - people who were looking
12:39 - to uh to work in a react project so yeah
12:42 - through uh through that
12:43 - uh i just joined it and i thought okay
12:46 - i'll see
12:47 - what all things are going on and as as
12:49 - soon as
12:50 - i went in there was one guy who was very
12:53 - active in the group
12:54 - so i just dm'd him and then i got reply
12:57 - after a few
12:58 - months and then eventually it started
13:01 - that was one of my mentors and then
13:04 - second one is in my organization where
13:06 - i work right so i work in dotnet sector
13:10 - so there was one guy who was looking for
13:12 - a person who can help him
13:14 - in building an internal project so it
13:17 - was internal open source project so i
13:19 - just
13:19 - volunteered from him volunteered for it
13:22 - and
13:23 - day before yesterday that side got live
13:26 - internally
13:27 - and um in his he's a team lead
13:30 - and he taught me about all those atomic
13:33 - design and how would we use it and all
13:35 - that stuff so amazing
13:37 - in the weekends uh we just get on a call
13:40 - and
13:40 - sometimes and then we just discuss it
13:43 - over it
13:44 - amazing dude that's exactly like that's
13:46 - the way to move forward um
13:48 - and and um i forgot what was the last
13:50 - point you mentioned you just mentioned
13:52 - something quite good uh just repeat that
13:53 - last point
13:54 - yeah so i wasn't able to join
13:57 - any of the live coaching calls last week
14:00 - yeah
14:01 - because i was in my free time from off
14:03 - office hours i was working on a react
14:05 - project that was
14:06 - an internal open source project for my
14:09 - organization
14:09 - right and it just went live day before
14:12 - yesterday okay and i got a lot of
14:14 - appreciation
14:15 - from my managers and all that nice i
14:17 - didn't do a very big thing it was just a
14:19 - very small
14:20 - contribution in the site but yeah we
14:22 - were people of four
14:23 - four people were there yeah and in that
14:25 - the person who was there
14:27 - the team lead he became my mentor
14:31 - nice dude that is amazing that is
14:34 - amazing
14:34 - and uh and what you want to do is
14:37 - position yourself
14:38 - in in like in situations that like are
14:40 - going to make you uncomfortable i can
14:42 - guarantee
14:43 - when you went into that position
14:44 - initially you were kind of like
14:46 - you were uncertain you must have been
14:48 - like a bit kind of nervous and
14:49 - and you know like and and i guarantee
14:51 - now like
14:53 - you probably made a good relationship
14:54 - with with that guy
14:56 - and uh and that's gonna definitely be
14:58 - something and the thing is you really do
14:59 - hold on to
15:00 - um those relationships because there's
15:02 - been situations where i've been stuck in
15:04 - really tight debugging situations where
15:06 - like
15:06 - you just wanna like scream at the
15:09 - computer right
15:10 - like like if nothing is going your way
15:12 - and it's kind of everything's breaking
15:14 - and um and that's when you i i have
15:16 - actually like
15:18 - reached out to a lot of the people i
15:19 - built a network with and kind of said
15:21 - like hey dude look
15:22 - i'm in a rut i have no idea how to get
15:24 - past this uh i have a client
15:26 - he's gonna he's paying x amount like can
15:27 - you help me out and i'll message a bunch
15:29 - of them i don't just message
15:30 - one this is the problem right we end up
15:32 - making like one friend in the coding
15:33 - world
15:34 - and we're like yeah yeah i'm networked
15:36 - up like no honestly guys you need to
15:38 - remember they're to be busy with your
15:40 - your
15:41 - someone who you usually reach out to you
15:42 - might just be completely busy and
15:44 - there's nothing wrong with that
15:45 - instead if i get super stuck i will
15:47 - message like 10 of my
15:48 - like my sort of developer friends who
15:50 - i'm like you know they might be able to
15:51 - help me out
15:52 - and i'll just literally send them the
15:53 - same message i'll be like yo what's up
15:54 - man like i'm kind of stuck i'm a bit
15:56 - over up like
15:57 - any chance you can help me out with this
15:58 - and i'll kind of like post a snippet
16:00 - on on i'll use something like rebel if
16:03 - it's simple and i'll share the code and
16:04 - what i'm kind of facing
16:05 - or if it's really intricate i'll share a
16:07 - github it depends on the sensitivity of
16:09 - what you're sharing as well
16:11 - but that's going to really progress you
16:13 - as a developer in my last job
16:16 - i was working with somebody who was a
16:19 - really seasoned front-end developer
16:21 - and i can promise you guys there is not
16:22 - a single tutorial
16:24 - in the entire planet that will teach me
16:26 - as much as i i sort of learned by just
16:28 - being with that guy who is so
16:30 - experienced in as a front-end developer
16:33 - the way they critique your work the way
16:34 - they kind of attack you with like this
16:36 - is you shouldn't do this like in the way
16:37 - that they say like you should do this
16:38 - and that
16:39 - the point is is why did why was it so
16:41 - effective it's because
16:43 - it's somebody who again we're going back
16:44 - to the one-third rule
16:46 - it's somebody who is above your skill
16:47 - level and you're pretty much just like
16:49 - you're just
16:50 - latching on to their sort of skill and
16:51 - and no matter what you surround yourself
16:53 - with that enough
16:54 - you'll get pulled up too right and then
16:56 - you get to a point where
16:57 - everyone always asks me the same
16:58 - question like saying how did you get so
17:00 - good at react and things like that
17:01 - guys i wasn't i wasn't like amazing at
17:04 - react like about
17:05 - a few years back i really wasn't i was
17:07 - kind of like uh that guy who was
17:09 - one of my friends said like hey have you
17:10 - ever coded him react i was like dude
17:12 - i've literally done jquery and that's
17:14 - about it and uh
17:16 - and now i'm like coding up these apps
17:17 - super quick and things like that and
17:18 - it's just repetition
17:19 - my practice but the main thing for me
17:22 - was mentors
17:22 - mentors right like finding a mentor
17:25 - finding somebody that you can work with
17:27 - and right now in this one room there are
17:29 - literally about 80 people
17:30 - inside this zoom core if you do not have
17:34 - somebody that you are like literally
17:36 - just use this as an opportunity to reach
17:38 - out to at least one person on this call
17:39 - right now
17:40 - and say hey you want to work on
17:41 - something or like hey do you want to
17:42 - let's talk about some some react stuff
17:44 - or like hey let's maybe like have an
17:46 - hour call
17:46 - you know if you're not doing that then
17:48 - you're literally cutting yourself short
17:49 - already because you might
17:51 - there might be a perfect mentor for you
17:52 - in here like i already know that we can
17:54 - mention a few people like
17:55 - priyanshu super young developer
17:57 - absolutely killing it he's made about
17:59 - he's making 330
18:00 - dollars a month and and he's young and
18:03 - he's based in india so
18:05 - never let age location anything like
18:07 - that stand in your way
18:08 - and you have access to the people inside
18:10 - the course so you can who can go ahead
18:11 - and do that
18:12 - you have people like frank seasoned
18:14 - developers landed huge
18:15 - huge contracts which are which is like
18:18 - i've never touched a contract as big as
18:19 - what
18:20 - frank had done so again like if i wanted
18:23 - to go back into freelancing world who do
18:24 - you think i'm going to speak to i'm
18:25 - going to go and speak straight to frank
18:27 - you know like i'm going to talk to him
18:28 - and say like dude how did you you know
18:30 - what was the best thing that you did in
18:31 - that situation
18:32 - because there's no point reinventing the
18:33 - world it's like if you're going to code
18:35 - up
18:36 - a date picker in react right i'm not
18:39 - going to code that
18:40 - i'm going to go and find a date pick a
18:42 - module which has loads of stars on
18:43 - github
18:44 - and i'm going to pull that into my
18:45 - project and figure out how to use it i'm
18:47 - not going to reinvent the world and
18:48 - things like that
18:49 - unless i absolutely have to that's when
18:51 - i would do that
18:52 - right so um everyone on youtube everyone
18:56 - in this call make sure you're at least
18:57 - like inside anyone inside of pwj
19:00 - use the community use the slack channel
19:02 - and really dive in
19:04 - and make sure you're asking somebody
19:05 - else or finding somebody else to work
19:07 - with
19:08 - on a on a regular basis and and honestly
19:11 - cycle it up you'll make so many friends
19:12 - like it's crazy like especially in pwg
19:14 - we have like 2 000 students right now
19:16 - um and also yeah that's another thing
19:18 - you have like so many more friends
19:20 - because like a lot of coders can be tend
19:23 - to be naturally introverted right like
19:24 - we like coding we like doing our thing
19:26 - on the computer
19:27 - um so where's the best place to find
19:29 - someone like-minded to you
19:31 - on the course right like on this on this
19:33 - platform if you if you're not enrolled
19:35 - in the course then
19:36 - link in the description you can go ahead
19:37 - and check it out or you can pretty much
19:39 - go ahead and um
19:41 - literally in the comments you can pretty
19:43 - much go ahead and check it out right
19:44 - like you can go ahead and say somebody
19:46 - reach out to me on this my linkedin like
19:48 - and pretty much is that simple
19:49 - right you can watch you can completely
19:51 - watch a whole nother channel
19:53 - on youtube and things like that you can
19:55 - watch like traversing media or something
19:56 - like that
19:57 - i'm pretty much just writing like hey
19:58 - anyone else want to pair program with me
20:00 - i'm working on some cool stuff
20:01 - someone will reach out to you i
20:02 - guarantee it someone will reach out to
20:03 - you if you do it enough
20:05 - and and that's going to be your start to
20:07 - building your network and trust me when
20:08 - i say that network is your net worth
20:10 - like literally if you go ahead and build
20:12 - out a crazy linkedin profile
20:14 - and i don't know how many of you guys
20:15 - like go ahead and raise your hand if
20:16 - you're into
20:17 - gary vee and his content
20:20 - right awesome crushing it very decently
20:23 - and i want so much value from it
20:25 - yeah he's absolutely killing it he
20:27 - released a bunch of like keynote slides
20:29 - and things like that which i definitely
20:30 - recommend reading
20:31 - and also he's talking about how like
20:34 - garyvee's is one of those people he
20:36 - he's very good at picking up on the
20:37 - trends that are about to blow up he
20:38 - predicted tick-tock he predicted like
20:40 - twitter when he was going up
20:41 - he did a lot of like sort of early
20:43 - predictions and now
20:45 - he's predicting linkedin is another one
20:47 - because on facebook on all those
20:49 - platforms
20:50 - they're very highly saturated where you
20:52 - would post a video and it's only going
20:53 - to go to your followers or like a small
20:55 - majority of other people
20:56 - on linkedin it's crazy you could post
20:58 - something right now
21:00 - include a couple of hashtags and that is
21:01 - going to get reached to so many people
21:04 - in that space
21:05 - right so imagine like the potential if
21:07 - you're dropping value after value after
21:09 - value after value
21:10 - every time you learn something write
21:12 - linkedin post share it boom
21:14 - shoot a little video saying like hey i
21:15 - just learned something new don't worry
21:16 - about looking stupid or looking shy like
21:18 - we all
21:19 - literally here's here's a trick everyone
21:22 - looks stupid in the beginning
21:23 - right like that's something that i will
21:25 - completely break down even the junior
21:27 - developer when you first propose like
21:29 - hey guys we should use this firebase
21:31 - like um database thing
21:32 - uh in the beginning i guarantee the
21:34 - first time you pitch it to your team
21:36 - you're going to kind of look a bit silly
21:37 - and they're going to look at you like
21:39 - you know how much you know because
21:41 - because i did that i did that exact
21:42 - thing and they were looking at me like
21:43 - what is this guy talking about
21:45 - but then you prove them wrong you just
21:46 - carry on doing it like yeah well you
21:47 - know like i'm gonna build it anyway and
21:49 - uh if it works we can go ahead and
21:51 - implement it so that's my advice
21:55 - the thing that you talked about linkedin
21:56 - that's so true about you know linkedin
21:58 - uh that's basically seo and
22:00 - i also i happen to have a good pdf book
22:02 - and it's
22:03 - it's not like an amazing book but it's
22:05 - makes it relatively good
22:06 - and i learned about linkedin quite a lot
22:08 - from that book so if anyone's
22:09 - interesting actually i'll just drop it
22:10 - in the live channel
22:11 - just like a pdf and uh yeah i think that
22:13 - everyone will find a lot of value from
22:15 - it
22:15 - exactly uh
22:18 - exactly yeah nice so
22:22 - adam i see like adam's doing it right
22:23 - i'm down to work on projects together
22:25 - i've never worked with anyone else but i
22:26 - have experience in react i'm learning
22:28 - right now that's it dude that's
22:30 - literally like that's all you have to do
22:32 - like you got
22:33 - you have to just shoot your shot right
22:35 - like uh if i hadn't done that me and
22:37 - kazi wouldn't be working right now i
22:38 - literally cause i said to kazzy i was
22:39 - like yo dude i'm pretty good with react
22:41 - kazi was shooting some stuff on
22:43 - javascript next thing you know we came
22:45 - together and now this this whole thing
22:46 - is blew up
22:47 - right so if you don't shoot that shot if
22:49 - you don't ask someone if you don't
22:51 - honestly even right now go ahead and
22:52 - share linkedin's on on the chat in the
22:54 - zoom chat and things like that
22:56 - um share your linkedin say like connect
22:58 - with me start talking to people start
22:59 - shooting messages
23:00 - back and forth i want you guys to build
23:02 - a network and trust me
23:04 - there's already 80 people in a room that
23:06 - all want to learn about the same thing
23:08 - that's a pretty powerful network right
23:10 - like if you can't get 80 people to debug
23:12 - a situation and one person to figure it
23:14 - out
23:15 - then there's i'm just trust me like one
23:16 - person will figure out your problem
23:18 - right so you see what i'm saying like it
23:20 - becomes a very quick tool to
23:22 - becoming a powerful and on linkedin
23:24 - honestly like you
23:26 - if you start building like enough and
23:27 - dropping enough value and things like
23:28 - that like your reach gets so
23:30 - stupidly big that that um
23:33 - when it comes to finding jobs when it
23:35 - comes to doing all that stuff people
23:36 - just swarm at you like a do you know how
23:38 - many
23:38 - like friend can vouch for this do you
23:40 - know how many recruiter
23:42 - messages you have to go through it's
23:45 - crazy
23:46 - yeah i started i started charging for
23:47 - them to talk to me yeah honestly
23:50 - i'm saying i sent them an invoice now
23:52 - yeah really
23:53 - yeah that's genius dude yeah because
23:56 - they're always asking about like oh we
23:58 - have a referral
24:00 - how about i invoice you first
24:04 - that's genius that's amazing dude i love
24:06 - that
24:07 - and you actually did so frank did a
24:08 - genius thing with it when it came to
24:09 - resumes as well so yeah
24:11 - uh you reviewed people's resumes right
24:13 - one second imran i'll come to you
24:15 - uh next for a question yeah you were you
24:18 - reviewed resumes right on linkedin
24:20 - yeah i put it up i put it up on on
24:23 - linkedin that like hey guys
24:24 - you know i'm a senior developer um i i
24:27 - have
24:27 - a lot of experience like hiring folks
24:30 - and kind of like the interview process
24:32 - like i can help you get less nervous if
24:34 - you're looking for a mobile role
24:36 - and now i guess i'm like react native
24:38 - guy again
24:39 - that's amazing dude and it's like and i
24:41 - did a mock interview with the person
24:43 - yeah and it was an hour long interview
24:46 - and they're like well but frank it's a
24:47 - long interview i was like
24:48 - most interviews are at least two hours
24:52 - you have to get the stamina for it so it
24:54 - was mock interviews
24:55 - real questions you know real projects
24:58 - and then also
24:58 - uh reviewed their uh their resume yeah
25:01 - and then it was it was very successful
25:03 - so it's it's
25:04 - linkedin is very powerful exactly really
25:06 - i think i'm gonna start
25:07 - i got i got the microphone coming you
25:09 - know nice to meet some quick little
25:11 - little snippets like yeah video on
25:14 - linkedin is powerful
25:16 - exactly i know and that goes to and
25:18 - before i'm definitely going to come to
25:19 - your mind in one sec
25:20 - um that actually goes to one point i
25:22 - want to mention and this was something
25:24 - i was very hesitant about before but
25:26 - like even small things like like
25:28 - upgrading a camera rig and things like
25:29 - that right
25:30 - upgrading camera upgrading mics and
25:32 - things like that like you might think of
25:33 - it as like oh they're just kind of fancy
25:35 - gadgets right they're kind of like you
25:37 - know it looks cool it kind of
25:39 - but the truth is it's an investment
25:42 - back into yourself just as much as like
25:44 - a book is just as much as
25:45 - much as a because the thing is like you
25:48 - buy a camera like if you i mean
25:49 - most people people could buy a camera
25:51 - they didn't never learn how to use it
25:52 - right
25:52 - but the goal is you want to buy stuff
25:54 - and and pretty much figure out like how
25:56 - it's going to benefit you don't buy
25:57 - random stuff by the way that was that
25:59 - didn't mean that in a generic way all
26:00 - right
26:01 - buy books that are going to help you if
26:02 - you're not reading right now pick up
26:04 - audible because i can't i personally am
26:06 - not a fan of reading
26:07 - i i prefer audio books i i'll go for a
26:09 - walk i'll go for a run
26:10 - and i'll have all the like audio just
26:12 - being read to me in my ear so it's
26:14 - pretty much
26:14 - it's very easy like way of consuming
26:16 - media now and you just have yeah
26:20 - pre-entry that's actually i'm going to
26:21 - highlight you one sec dude this book
26:23 - guys soft skills by john sonmez
26:26 - i've read like 14 chapters already and
26:28 - trust me i this is the best investment
26:30 - i've made
26:30 - yeah nice investment one hundred percent
26:33 - you know
26:34 - at least buy this book like you're never
26:36 - gonna regret a book like this because
26:37 - it's
26:38 - phenomenal like he talks about you know
26:40 - how to start with freelancing he even
26:42 - talks about
26:42 - you know how do you approach someone he
26:44 - talks about niches and he talks about
26:46 - all those kinds of stuff
26:47 - he talks about marketing yourself and so
26:49 - much more guys like
26:51 - just just buy this book or read it on
26:53 - audible as uh sunny said it's available
26:56 - it's amazing just just take the action
26:59 - of
26:59 - buying this at least exactly dude like a
27:02 - 100 percent
27:03 - soft skills by john thomas it completely
27:05 - changed the way i started building
27:07 - clients and building
27:08 - uh everyone and and it was when i took
27:10 - my sort of freelancing journey from
27:12 - somewhat of like a more of a hobby kind
27:14 - of ish thing to
27:16 - something that could support me
27:17 - financially completely just
27:25 - 100 yeah exactly and then guys
27:28 - it's more a case of like take it from
27:31 - from actual like
27:32 - you could always kind of read it in an
27:34 - article you can read it and it's not but
27:35 - when you see someone like
27:36 - even like priyanka when you see them
27:38 - without frank or shrika like
27:40 - they're kind of they're breaking the
27:42 - sort of like you know what is what the
27:43 - kind of normal
27:44 - what we're told to believe what we're
27:46 - kind of told to kind of think
27:48 - is is the reality like you know you have
27:50 - to work two years to earn this much
27:51 - money or you have to work
27:53 - x way to make certain kind of money like
27:56 - screw all of that stuff
27:57 - and just listen to the tips and tricks
27:59 - from people who have done it
28:01 - and and trust me you'll just skip all
28:03 - the riff raff and remember you don't
28:04 - want to
28:05 - following the same path everyone else is
28:08 - following isn't the right way
28:09 - right just because everyone else is
28:10 - going that way it just goes the other
28:12 - way like
28:12 - it's scary yeah sure like we've all
28:14 - taken that risk we've all taken that
28:15 - dive into
28:16 - even the first time i learnt re i took
28:18 - it i literally took a job
28:19 - where redux was a main requirement i
28:21 - blagged my way through the interview and
28:22 - i just picked it up on the train
28:24 - ride in to work i was literally watching
28:26 - youtube and i figured out redux on
28:28 - the first week by just watching video
28:30 - after video after video
28:31 - and i used some dodgy ios app to
28:34 - download the youtube videos before
28:36 - youtube premium was the thing so you see
28:37 - like you make it work right
28:40 - but imran you had a question
28:46 - uh i think he is oh what's up jesse hey
28:50 - welcome
28:53 - yo
28:56 - sonic
29:00 - [Music]
29:06 - and the question was what
29:09 - what are the aspects of you what are the
29:12 - difficult aspects of using functional
29:14 - components in reject
29:16 - what was the difference between
29:18 - functional sorry
29:20 - no no what are the most difficult
29:22 - aspects of using
29:24 - function component in react okay so what
29:26 - are the most difficult
29:28 - uh like uh sort of concepts or areas of
29:30 - using functional components inside of
29:32 - react
29:32 - effects aspects okay so what is the most
29:36 - difficult aspects of using
29:37 - um functional components inside of react
29:40 - what i would have said another component
29:42 - functional component right
29:44 - so so the question so is this for an
29:46 - interview this would they ask you this
29:50 - yeah okay so firstly it's a strange
29:52 - question in an interview
29:54 - um about but what i would say is is it
29:56 - the difficult
29:57 - uh what is it difficult for you guys or
30:01 - for me like what's yeah yeah that's what
30:03 - i would say i'd be like
30:04 - are you guys i'd be like can you clarify
30:06 - that one of those questions
30:08 - yeah i'd be like do you do you guys know
30:09 - how to use your functional components
30:11 - like
30:11 - this kind of you should also yeah also
30:14 - whenever
30:16 - when you're doing interviews also it's
30:18 - okay to like not know everything
30:20 - yeah just it's okay to say can you
30:22 - explain that a little bit
30:24 - better what what what aspect of what yes
30:27 - to write it to to use it inside of a
30:30 - nested function somewhere else like
30:32 - you know or you know what specifically
30:35 - like you know it's okay to ask questions
30:37 - to clarify because sometimes
30:39 - people have interview questions that are
30:40 - like very kind of like they're the ones
30:42 - that know it
30:43 - nobody else knows it yeah so you have to
30:45 - kind of
30:46 - get a little bit more information that's
30:47 - part of the skills yeah and guys never
30:50 - get disheartened like you know how many
30:52 - times i've been in an interview and
30:53 - they've made me feel really dumb
30:54 - because they've asked me like some crazy
30:56 - algorithm kind of question
30:58 - and the truth is is that i didn't know i
31:00 - just had no idea how to answer it
31:02 - i've answered some of them i've broken
31:04 - down others and this and that but like
31:06 - there are going to be situations where
31:07 - they'll catch you out and they kind of
31:08 - ask you some strange question
31:10 - and the truth is is that that again it's
31:12 - not actually down to what questions
31:14 - you're being asked it's about selling
31:15 - yourself as a
31:16 - as a developer as some value to the
31:18 - company so you can actually flip
31:20 - an entire interview which i've done
31:21 - before where they've kind of came in
31:23 - with the sort of technical we're going
31:24 - to ask you this this this
31:26 - and then before you know it you're now
31:27 - talking about some experiences where you
31:29 - got into a debugging situation for
31:31 - for a week straight and and how you
31:33 - overcame it and you're just talking
31:34 - about your story
31:35 - so you can flip that you can you can
31:37 - completely flip those situations and
31:39 - it's something you can do
31:40 - but to answer imran's question um what
31:43 - are the most
31:44 - difficult aspects of functional
31:46 - components inside of react
31:48 - what i would say is before what would
31:50 - have happened
31:51 - is functional components were amazing
31:54 - for many reasons but the reason why they
31:56 - were limited was because you couldn't
31:57 - have state
31:58 - inside of a functional component right
32:00 - and that was very limited and that meant
32:02 - that we couldn't have
32:04 - um we couldn't have a sensual
32:05 - functionality inside of a component so
32:07 - we had to kind of
32:08 - if we needed state we would have to kind
32:10 - of convert it to a class-based component
32:12 - use the constructor and things like that
32:13 - and have everything set up and then
32:14 - you'd be able to use state in the
32:16 - component
32:16 - now that's when react hooks came in and
32:19 - you see what they might have been doing
32:20 - here
32:21 - is testing that oh do they know what
32:23 - does he know about react hooks
32:25 - or you see like it could have been like
32:26 - an actual sort of like
32:28 - a side question to kind of check if you
32:30 - know about react hooks but it wasn't
32:31 - mentioned in that way
32:32 - and then what i'd say is yeah but that
32:34 - react hooks came in and now it's
32:35 - actually extremely easy
32:37 - using the use state hook to now have
32:39 - state inside of a functional component
32:41 - so if you asked me
32:43 - what i would build a class based or
32:44 - functional i would now go with a
32:46 - functional component for many reasons
32:48 - like it's easier to write it's easier to
32:49 - read and maintain
32:51 - the use effect hook actually replaces
32:53 - the life cycle methods inside of a
32:54 - class-based component
32:55 - if you start dropping that on them then
32:57 - they're just like holy okay like
32:59 - this person is up to date they know
33:00 - their stuff
33:00 - right okay that's cool like you see and
33:03 - then you can kind of then you can at
33:04 - that point you can be like
33:05 - oh actually um there's actually a really
33:07 - cool website called use hooks.com and
33:09 - and then they'll be like oh really
33:10 - like that's a cool website
33:12 - and uh and then but yeah i used one for
33:14 - firestore like and you see like take
33:15 - your skill
33:16 - that much further and uh you kind of
33:18 - flip the script on these kind of
33:20 - conversations and
33:21 - you just win their trust because they're
33:22 - like oh he answered my question and he
33:24 - went that extra step and he knows his
33:26 - stuff
33:28 - thank you thank you very much amazing
33:30 - don't worry dude thank you
33:32 - um but again that's a very open question
33:35 - yeah
33:35 - and yeah it's always good to kind of
33:38 - unpack things and say okay it's like
33:41 - okay i can talk to you like
33:43 - what they are well the definition is
33:46 - like
33:46 - what exactly are you looking for like
33:48 - are you looking for like you know
33:49 - why they got updated recently and like
33:51 - react you know 17
33:53 - like what what what exactly are we
33:55 - looking for yeah it's okay to ask
33:57 - to expand stuff yeah and never feel like
33:59 - you're wrong by asking them because
34:01 - sometimes the person interview and i
34:03 - mean i've had it where
34:05 - like and it's only through actually
34:07 - carrying out the interviews i realized
34:09 - this like
34:10 - some people interviewing you are just
34:12 - kind of as nervous sometimes weirdly as
34:14 - you like
34:14 - they kind of don't actually hold the
34:16 - interview that great either and they can
34:17 - kind of come across
34:18 - it depends like a very um
34:21 - a very experienced like kind of senior
34:23 - developer might actually be able to
34:25 - carry an interview really well right
34:26 - they'll be able to know if like
34:28 - because the truth is that if i was
34:29 - interviewing anyone inside this core
34:31 - right now
34:31 - uh yeah sure i'd be looking at elements
34:33 - of tech and i'll be this now but i'd be
34:34 - looking at you sort of your approach to
34:37 - overcoming if you hear a debugging
34:38 - situation
34:39 - so if if i said to you right i would
34:42 - write like a little test sort of react
34:43 - app and i'd kind of have an intentional
34:45 - bug in there somewhere
34:46 - and i would pretty much go ahead and be
34:48 - like i'll just kind of watch you and be
34:49 - like yo like
34:50 - just go ahead and you can jump in ask me
34:52 - questions what and the truth is is that
34:54 - i would want i'd be more interested in
34:55 - the person was like
34:56 - um i have a question about this so this
34:59 - is where the state is getting set up
35:00 - right and it seems like that shouldn't
35:02 - be there
35:03 - um but i'm not 100 sure like that person
35:06 - is you know at least they're asking the
35:08 - question
35:08 - but you'll get somebody else who would
35:10 - kind of like sit there and kind of like
35:11 - tinker around with it make a mistake
35:13 - think around with it make a mistake a
35:14 - bit no no i know this don't worry take
35:15 - her out make a mistake
35:16 - and now that person is killing through
35:18 - time right they're coming through time
35:20 - they're burning through things and
35:21 - they're letting the ego their sort of
35:23 - ego stop them from asking that question
35:25 - and that's the kind of developer that
35:27 - you kind of want somebody who um
35:29 - who is very like open mindset to
35:31 - learning
35:32 - um also a really cool cool note i'm just
35:34 - going to highlight on the screen
35:35 - we've got mohit mo via who he says
35:39 - on youtube he says thank you very much
35:41 - sonia and kazi because of you i landed
35:42 - my first job on upwork thank you very
35:43 - much
35:44 - that's awesome hey awesome stuff dude
35:47 - um amazing and um yeah
35:50 - okay cool um so yeah i think that's
35:53 - pretty much concludes
35:54 - that sort of section of what we're
35:55 - talking about i think what we should do
35:57 - now is
35:58 - let's dive into um a react
36:01 - quickly a react but i want to kind of
36:03 - run over the difference between a class
36:05 - based and functional because that we
36:07 - talked about
36:07 - i think it'd be very quick really nice
36:09 - sort of quick sort of run through and i
36:10 - can explain
36:11 - an extension that you should all be
36:12 - using um called es6 redux
36:15 - snippets and things like that and then
36:17 - once we get we're going to
36:18 - kind of go through that at a quite a
36:19 - fast pace and then we're going to do
36:21 - uh we're going to go ahead and set up
36:23 - our first react native app okay
36:25 - so let's go ahead
36:28 - yeah sharika actually that's a good
36:29 - point so sharika built so
36:31 - the backstory behind sharika he was part
36:33 - of a hackathon
36:34 - um and shrika i mean you can tell the
36:37 - story dude
36:40 - go for it you're alive dude what story
36:43 - um
36:44 - so the hackathon uh app that you've
36:46 - built and and you want to share your
36:49 - um i won a few prizes last weekend nice
36:52 - one uh i won best use of google cloud at
36:54 - your hackathon
36:55 - yep oh best uix hack nice
36:59 - and uh oh second place startup yeah
37:04 - i've heard the app it's basically a
37:06 - wildfire app where it notifies
37:08 - people on like pollution and fires near
37:10 - them and they can also read up
37:11 - on news amazing and dude how old are you
37:14 - 13 13 guys
37:18 - that is killer yeah so that's amazing
37:20 - and you wanted to show us so
37:22 - uh shriek is using something called expo
37:24 - to sort of develop
37:25 - an app and what he what you can do in
37:28 - expo
37:28 - is it will only work for everyone who's
37:30 - downloaded it but it's very simple as
37:32 - long as you've got a qr scanner you can
37:33 - try what we're about to do
37:35 - um but i think what he's done is you can
37:38 - code up your app and then you can
37:40 - actually sort of get everyone else to
37:41 - sort of
37:41 - test the app on their phone on their
37:44 - computer by using a qr code so
37:46 - um srika do you want to go ahead and
37:48 - actually share that qr code
37:54 - uh yeah wait one second okay so once he
37:57 - shared that all you need is you're on
37:58 - ios you just pull out the camera app on
38:00 - android i think you have a qr code
38:02 - scanner you just pull that up and you'll
38:03 - be able to scan this if you don't have
38:05 - expo the app installed on your phone it
38:07 - should just go ahead and
38:09 - and take you to the app store i think
38:11 - but here we go
38:12 - awesome so go ahead open up and let's go
38:15 - ahead and i'm going to point my phone
38:17 - at that and it says open in expo so
38:21 - i'm going to show it on it asks for your
38:23 - location accept
38:24 - it because there's actually some pretty
38:26 - relevant location
38:28 - type things in there so right so we're
38:30 - going to trust
38:31 - shrieker on this one guys he's not gonna
38:33 - hack us
38:34 - nice um let's go ahead and see
38:38 - okay so mine's loading up right now it
38:40 - says oh is this it right welcome to
38:42 - dude i love the ui i thought this was
38:44 - like a a screen forum i'm going to go
38:47 - ahead and show this on the on the screen
38:48 - right now
38:49 - so my phone's cracked so you guys might
38:50 - not be able to see that but oh
38:52 - i haven't got auto focus on you can see
38:54 - the ui is uh
38:55 - it's actually pretty nice right so they
38:57 - can't they can't really see it fully
38:59 - damn it
39:00 - um i'll turn it off focus on next time
39:02 - but um
39:03 - okay so welcome to one let me go ahead
39:05 - and register an account
39:06 - and um it would be really cool if i
39:09 - could show this on the screen okay
39:10 - so i'm gonna register i'm gonna say
39:12 - sunny oh sonny there's a way to do it
39:15 - oh yeah oh you can do it right so you
39:18 - can actually do if you do
39:19 - like a usb connector or something just
39:21 - like charge your phone with your
39:22 - computer
39:23 - yeah but the thing is i think actually
39:26 - so you can do it through um
39:28 - let me go ahead and i don't have my wire
39:30 - here
39:31 - uh okay what i'll do is i'll go ahead
39:33 - and i share it on this so on youtube i
39:35 - think they can see it a little bit i
39:36 - mean
39:37 - i think you guys can see it a bit but
39:39 - it's not gonna work out properly
39:41 - um okay dude i'll run through it anyway
39:43 - so we've got i'm going to enter my email
39:44 - address
39:45 - anger at jim oh god i didn't realize i
39:48 - was actually murmuring now
39:52 - and then i'm going to put a password in
39:55 - okay and guys all you need to do if you
39:57 - want to interact with this now is scan
39:58 - that qr code and you guys can test it
40:00 - out so i'm going to hit register
40:02 - and then oh nice dude holy crap okay
40:07 - so guys this is the screen that is
40:08 - taking me to so it says dashboard
40:10 - right so you guys might not might be
40:12 - able to see that it says dashboard my
40:13 - phone is correct i know
40:14 - and what it says is it's got heat maps
40:16 - it's got air quality temperature
40:18 - so it's actually found my location it's
40:21 - got the air quality and temperature
40:23 - and it's got the heat maps i'll tell you
40:24 - what actually if this is running on your
40:26 - computer right now
40:27 - shrika do you mind hitting run in web
40:29 - browser
40:31 - yes yeah so if you go ahead and hit run
40:33 - in web browser
40:34 - this should spin it up on a web browser
40:36 - we should be able to actually show
40:37 - everyone this
40:38 - and you can go ahead and demo your app
40:40 - but this is cool dude
40:41 - you've got news feed we have nearby
40:43 - fires we have notifications
40:45 - um oh my god this is sick okay nice
40:50 - and uh shrika how long did this take
40:52 - sorry i am not able to do it
40:54 - i tried to scan it right you scan life
40:57 - but it is not working okay so when you
40:59 - scanned it did it say open
41:01 - in expo it says okay and there is a url
41:05 - in it
41:07 - it says okay and there's a url in it um
41:09 - okay so you need to have export
41:11 - yeah you need to install expo the app on
41:13 - your phone
41:15 - or export install yeah it's called expo
41:18 - client
41:18 - expo client yeah so ramy david was just
41:20 - asking yeah
41:22 - um oh i don't think it's working on my
41:25 - web browser
41:26 - i think it's because like there's like a
41:28 - billion people just like
41:30 - yeah right now it might be oh nice look
41:32 - you've got loads of people jumping
41:34 - on um okay in that case what i can say
41:37 - is i
41:37 - guys take my word i man i'm going to set
41:40 - that that auto focus properly
41:42 - um this camera is known for auto focus
41:44 - as well um but basically what i can do
41:46 - is actually on the coaching call
41:48 - what i can do is maybe oh i have an idea
41:51 - dude i know how we're gonna do this i'm
41:53 - gonna stop your share
41:55 - and i'm gonna make my screen spotlighted
41:58 - and i will show you guys this way so i'm
42:00 - gonna replace the spotlight there we go
42:03 - i was able to install it so you guys can
42:06 - see this right

42:11 - experience better guys so like i will
42:13 - share my
42:14 - phone next time but you can see we've
42:15 - got these tabs at the bottom and as i
42:17 - click them it takes me to new screens
42:18 - there's a news feed right there's a full
42:21 - news feed which is awesome
42:22 - and even the design review and share it
42:25 - with other content
42:26 - contacts that you know nice dude and if
42:29 - you
42:30 - see at the top it says london so that's
42:32 - where i am right now it shows me my air
42:34 - quality
42:34 - the temperature and it will actually
42:36 - show so what is this at the bottom right
42:38 - here so heat maps
42:41 - oh nice okay i've clicked it oh damn
42:44 - okay
42:44 - this is cool right so i've just hit i've
42:47 - just hit heat maps
42:48 - and check this out guys it's actually
42:50 - showing me a map and the temperature
42:52 - zones
42:52 - around london which is
42:56 - insane and this was built with watch
42:58 - rico
42:59 - react native yeah react native nice
43:03 - and apis okay and how much um how long
43:06 - did this take i say how much
43:07 - how much to buy this did
43:10 - and uh and um how long did this take to
43:13 - to
43:14 - to go ahead and build um
43:17 - [Music]
43:19 - 24 to 36 hours what
43:22 - oh my god that is that is insane dude
43:24 - nice
43:25 - 26 today okay that is awesome so 26 30
43:28 - hours around that time frame
43:30 - dude well done that is awesome man even
43:32 - if you like open up the new screen
43:35 - yeah it opens up a model okay you can
43:37 - share it to
43:39 - people you know right so i've clicked on
43:41 - these videos articles
43:43 - and then you'll actually get it oh
43:45 - really
43:46 - oh nice oh man and then it will open up
43:49 - but is it just the url that it's gonna

45:10 - to
45:11 - yeah honestly it's awesome man
45:14 - you you might as well make some money
45:16 - what phone are you using right now frank
45:18 - um i i have my hold on one second
45:22 - i got my text size a little bit larger
45:24 - oh all right that's probably why yeah i
45:25 - was wondering okay there we go yeah
45:27 - don't worry yeah
45:28 - i do expo too sharika was like goddammit
45:32 - what is this
45:35 - i do this on purpose to break my own app
45:37 - so this is again something that we're
45:38 - saying like yeah that's clever i never
45:40 - even thought that that's cool yeah
45:42 - well it's like you have to because like
45:43 - some like okay guys i'm working on an
45:46 - app
45:46 - also it's it's music based and sometimes
45:48 - the
45:49 - the name of the songs are really long so
45:51 - i have to i have to check for that kind
45:53 - of stuff
45:54 - so i make the text big make it small
45:56 - still
45:57 - make it uh unbreakable exactly yeah this
46:00 - is amazing guys
46:01 - like i'm here in austin texas uh i guess
46:04 - we have
46:05 - good air quality i'm not sure oh dude
46:07 - you're in texas
46:08 - nice i don't know got heat maps
46:12 - i still not able to get into it
46:15 - i still install expo yeah so guys
46:18 - remember expo what's happening is shrika
46:22 - set up a tunnel
46:22 - where he basically tunnels the
46:24 - connection to download
46:26 - the app and things like that when a lot
46:28 - of people can connect it can be very
46:30 - slow to download the bundle so
46:31 - don't worry if you can't connect to it
46:33 - now um but
46:34 - just understand that that's what you can
46:36 - do in export think about all the use
46:38 - cases for it
46:39 - but overall dude this app is sick this
46:41 - is really really cool
46:42 - amazing this is very fast yeah really
46:44 - really nice
46:47 - sunny i would like to know how what
46:50 - tools we are using
46:51 - to do this because i have a scan life
46:55 - and
46:56 - i installed expo on my phone iphone
47:00 - so how to make it work how to i scanned
47:03 - it
47:03 - it is again showing me the same screen
47:06 - um
47:07 - you most likely are running into like a
47:08 - little edge case dude so i would say
47:10 - maybe
47:11 - um share what you're seeing in the zoom
47:14 - chat
47:14 - or we can debug it afterwards on on
47:17 - slack
47:18 - just try and share it okay yep news feed
47:20 - it's amazing
47:22 - can you share the qr code again um
47:26 - guys i would say at this point honestly
47:28 - like uh because his tunnel is probably
47:30 - getting overwhelmed right now so maybe
47:31 - just
47:32 - just go ahead and use what frank was
47:34 - showing to pretty much look at what was
47:36 - possible with the app
47:37 - but shrika let's let's quickly run
47:39 - through uh a quick thing of
47:40 - of what did you use to go ahead and uh
47:43 - to build that so
47:44 - i'm guessing you would need used
47:46 - firebase authentication
47:48 - right uh yeah react native yeah and then
47:51 - a few
47:51 - like uh air quality apis and stuff okay
47:54 - nice and was they were they free or paid
47:57 - apis
47:58 - free nice okay so free apis firebase
48:01 - authentication is free to get set up and
48:03 - use
48:04 - um did you have a uh so for the
48:07 - navigation aspect of the app what were
48:08 - you using
48:11 - navigation awesome right so we have an
48:13 - event navigation that's gonna handle all
48:14 - the sort of page routing at the bottom
48:16 - of the screen
48:17 - um and then what else did you use that
48:20 - you would find did you use any kind of
48:22 - form of redox or state management
48:25 - nope okay so nice there you go unless
48:27 - this is answering a lot of questions
48:28 - right now where
48:29 - you don't need to over complicate the
48:32 - build with redux
48:33 - all the time we'll react context api
48:35 - most of us even i did in the beginning i
48:36 - was kind of like
48:37 - as soon as i build an app i have to set
48:38 - up redux i have to set up this i have to
48:40 - sell that
48:40 - don't do that because it just over
48:42 - complicates the build
48:44 - just go ahead and add what you need as
48:46 - and when you need it
48:47 - right that's going to be the best way to
48:48 - progress forward um
48:50 - expo is actually this is this is amazing
48:53 - man this is from a senior developer over
48:55 - here
48:56 - like i'm i'm very impressed yeah dude
48:59 - that short amount of time like congrats
49:02 - this is
49:02 - like really good work
49:06 - no doubt dude 100 like if you showed
49:08 - that to an employer
49:09 - to anybody yeah you'll be very very
49:12 - impressed you will get
49:13 - so i would recommend you to just apply
49:15 - for freelancing jobs and then
49:16 - show this app and make some more apps if
49:18 - you want to and then actually you can
49:20 - start freelancing right now so
49:22 - don't even don't even care about
49:23 - whatever anyone else tells you just
49:25 - make some accounts and go for it bro
49:27 - exactly
49:29 - exactly also we haven't speaking of jobs
49:31 - adnan
49:32 - razak says hey proper reactor i recently
49:34 - got a job in dolby germany as a
49:36 - javascript developer thank you for your
49:37 - videos you're just awesome
49:38 - amazing so loads of people getting jobs
49:40 - now that's crazy man
49:41 - um shrika just to show you right
49:44 - honestly if you went into
49:46 - um somebody said baby yoda of coding
49:48 - it's so funny you said that because
49:49 - there's literally a baby yoda in like in
49:51 - the corner of my room right now
49:53 - so if you're watching on youtube you can
49:54 - see it over there um
49:56 - but that's uh that's funny but um
49:59 - yeah if you were if you were to go into
50:01 - an interview right it doesn't matter
50:03 - what your resume looked like doesn't
50:04 - matter what anything look like you
50:06 - pulled that out
50:06 - and said yeah i built this go ahead and
50:08 - play with it right
50:10 - or scan this qr code and they would
50:11 - launch it with expo they would be able
50:14 - to by playing through it like as a sort
50:16 - of seasoned
50:16 - kind of developer i was like okay he
50:18 - must have used some kind of
50:19 - authentication
50:20 - regardless of what it was it's
50:22 - authentication which is not always an
50:24 - easy problem to solve um
50:26 - and especially for those people who
50:27 - don't know about firebase authentication
50:29 - um and then you also have the the fact
50:32 - of getting the app set up in the first
50:33 - place then you also have setting up with
50:35 - expo you did that successfully
50:37 - then you had react native navigation
50:39 - that's showing us
50:40 - like a million words just in that little
50:43 - and then and it's a
50:44 - fun way of showing skills right the one
50:47 - thing i'm against is when you kind of go
50:49 - into somebody's portfolio and it's like
50:51 - uh react native and there's a there's a
50:53 - progress bar and it's like 75
50:55 - what does that mean right like if i see
50:58 - if i see a react bar and it's like
51:00 - please don't do that
51:01 - yeah it looks good in the website
51:04 - it's really hard to read though too
51:06 - because you know some people have like
51:08 - slower browsers and
51:10 - don't put don't put how many like some
51:12 - some people put years of experience but
51:15 - that's only for the recruiters like when
51:16 - you actually sit down in front of
51:18 - someone they'll say
51:19 - did you do four years of advanced stuff
51:23 - or did you do four years of not advanced
51:25 - stuff there's a huge difference
51:26 - exactly exactly this is this is
51:29 - in 24 hours man like what the heck
51:33 - dude and entry how many people were in
51:35 - your team
51:37 - it was just one person oh man that is
51:40 - sick and
51:41 - were you coding uh this is actually
51:44 - another handy question for everyone
51:45 - watching
51:45 - so you were pair programming with him
51:47 - was it next to each other or was it
51:50 - using like a vs code live share or that
51:53 - kind of stuff
51:54 - oh no dude we didn't do ps4 or anything
51:56 - it's just
51:57 - we collabed over github oh
52:00 - so this entire thing was over github as
52:02 - well yeah
52:04 - oh man it's even more impressive like
52:06 - you could literally
52:07 - so now you can share the repo share the
52:10 - honestly if you push that to your github
52:12 - have the qr code
52:13 - i'm not sure if you can actually host
52:14 - the demo on expo online yeah you can you
52:17 - can like publish the project
52:19 - so then anybody can scan the qr code
52:22 - then
52:22 - dude that is insane you know what to do
52:25 - that as a step one and step two
52:27 - release the app like literally take it
52:29 - that extra step and kind of release the
52:31 - app and say like this is a fire tracker
52:33 - things that it like costs
52:34 - a bit to release it waiting on the
52:38 - product
52:38 - i could show you exactly how to release
52:40 - it for free they have it free for
52:42 - students
52:44 - nice oh okay so guys that is literally
52:47 - an example
52:48 - real time of networking right like that
52:51 - is literally it
52:52 - so like not a hundred dollars they don't
52:53 - do that exactly
52:55 - so sharika speak to frank after and and
52:58 - dude we want to see that app in the app
53:00 - store and i can and even i can help you
53:02 - out with like test flight and things
53:03 - like that
53:04 - i was really impressed like this was
53:07 - very impressive for me
53:08 - yeah that's insane like trust me like
53:11 - i've seen so many
53:12 - um so many new apps that are coming in
53:14 - and they're gonna have good ui
53:16 - but this one is like you know having
53:18 - those round borders and all that kind of
53:20 - stuff
53:20 - and i think react native might come in
53:22 - with that but
53:23 - the navigation is smooth you are pulling
53:26 - in data from apis and you're doing
53:28 - authentication
53:29 - so there's a lot of complexity involved
53:30 - too and um
53:32 - yeah bro like i would be the first one
53:34 - to install that app
53:35 - yeah that's it honestly it's amazing
53:37 - dude sharika guess what somebody on
53:39 - youtube
53:42 - what's your email i have a mobile
53:43 - project for you so you might have just
53:45 - landed a client
53:46 - yeah so you might just land the client
53:48 - so go ahead and check out youtube the
53:50 - live chat
53:51 - um but uh already what was that
53:55 - tell them i already hired him
53:56 - [Laughter]
54:00 - nathan's already grabbed him
54:04 - nice for anyone who's wondering whether
54:06 - it's for android or ios just don't even
54:08 - care because it's for both react native
54:09 - does it for both
54:10 - yep exactly so that's the benefit of
54:12 - using react native as well
54:13 - um oh this is another question so when
54:16 - you set up the firebase authentication
54:18 - did you use react native firebase um so
54:21 - the neat little react native firebase
54:23 - package um i
54:25 - always forget their name but there's uh
54:28 - frank what's the name of it we we talked
54:30 - about it last time
54:31 - it's called rn firebase.io or something
54:34 - like that yeah rn firebase.io is that
54:36 - the one you use trico or did you use the
54:38 - a different approach
54:40 - uh yeah so like my teammate he was
54:43 - working on the firebase integration and
54:45 - backend but like he used
54:47 - he didn't specifically use
54:49 - ironfirebase.io
54:50 - right he like used it for documentation
54:52 - to help him
54:53 - along but he didn't install that package
54:56 - okay okay interesting interesting so did
54:59 - he install
55:00 - any kind of native dependencies or
55:05 - uh no not so sure okay cool no problem
55:08 - dude
55:09 - the main thing is you got it working so
55:10 - that's that's insane uh really really
55:12 - awesome
55:12 - it does it does the geo stuff so like it
55:14 - has to be installing something cool
55:17 - yeah oh yes yeah it does it checks it
55:19 - out and all that stuff so you would have
55:20 - had to install something
55:22 - um that's that's really like amazing
55:25 - stuff
55:25 - go ahead and show uh shrika some love in
55:27 - the in in the
55:28 - zoom chat and then just scream it out if
55:30 - you wanna because
55:32 - he deserves that that's crazy man um
55:35 - right so uh for everyone also for
55:37 - everyone um you've got loads of people
55:39 - messaging on youtube as well
55:41 - uh kanye g says congrats um mustafa
55:44 - mahmood says this is gonna be recorded
55:45 - yeah everything is recorded
55:47 - and uh and also badan azam shrika just
55:50 - dropped his email so
55:51 - you know do your thing get a little
55:54 - client going
55:56 - amazing so guys look making making like
55:58 - little little deals happen on the stream
56:00 - that's cool all right if it's not legit
56:04 - we're going to hunt you down
56:05 - yeah exactly we there's 88 people in
56:07 - this school that
56:08 - are going to network together you know
56:12 - we're very protective of the community
56:14 - exactly don't be a bad don't be bad a
56:17 - bad client
56:18 - exactly all right so guys
56:21 - i believed it yeah i believe that we can
56:24 - also make it in a
56:25 - react itself instead of react
56:29 - nature yeah so i did this yeah so
56:32 - remember
56:32 - using the api and location you can
56:34 - easily figure it out
56:35 - so remember there are differences right
56:38 - so it depends on what your your approach
56:40 - is so
56:40 - remember this is also a good question
56:41 - for anyone who's kind of confused as to
56:43 - what react
56:44 - is against react native um so react is
56:46 - essentially going to allow you to build
56:48 - something called a progressive web app
56:50 - right so it's it's an app that runs on a
56:51 - browser so the the benefits of a pwa
56:55 - progressive web app is that you can
56:56 - pretty much one the
56:58 - the the development time is extremely
57:00 - fast right so so developing a
57:03 - a pwa is a lot faster than developing a
57:05 - native app
57:06 - um that's from experience i think like
57:08 - people might argue
57:10 - otherwise but in my experience it's just
57:12 - a lot faster than developing it and now
57:13 - if you want to release
57:15 - the app it's also a click pretty much a
57:17 - case of like if you're using firebase
57:19 - anyway it's going to be firebase deploy
57:20 - in the cli
57:21 - and boom like your app is your up is
57:23 - pretty much you do npm run build first
57:25 - don't forget that guys
57:26 - uh and then you do then you do firebase
57:28 - deploy
57:29 - because i know how many times that
57:30 - caught everyone out um
57:33 - so that's going to be pretty much done
57:34 - but if you go ahead and create a
57:37 - say like you make some changes to an app
57:39 - version now you're going to have to
57:42 - go ahead and create and
57:45 - bump the version create another bundle
57:47 - uh
57:48 - deploy it so you on ios you do something
57:50 - called test flight and things like that
57:52 - you can do a bunch of different things i
57:54 - can't actually remember what test flight
57:55 - how we use it but but i used test flight
57:57 - in the past and then you basically go
57:59 - ahead and you have to
58:00 - get approval in the app store and the
58:02 - play store
58:03 - play store is generally more easy going
58:05 - the app store is a little bit more hard
58:06 - going
58:07 - and then you get to release your app
58:09 - right so there's a whole process kind of
58:11 - involved sure you can make it quicker
58:13 - um and you can actually get quite quick
58:14 - with that but use a lot of setup and
58:16 - things like that involved whereas
58:18 - on react is extremely fast and now react
58:21 - the benefit of a pwa
58:22 - is um if you develop a pwa if you can
58:25 - actually
58:26 - on on safari you can click on the little
58:28 - bottom button one with the little sort
58:30 - of arrow pointing up
58:31 - and you can actually click add to home
58:32 - screen on ios and i think you do the
58:34 - same for android
58:35 - and guys that actually kind of pretty
58:37 - much installs
58:38 - the app on your phone and when you open
58:41 - it that way
58:42 - it doesn't have now no longer the sort
58:43 - of um browser looking for it's like it's
58:46 - pretty much a native app at that point
58:48 - right so not many people know that but
58:50 - if you go ahead and do add to home
58:51 - screen you get a native app experience
58:53 - and if you deploy you're now getting the
58:55 - real-time sort of
58:56 - sort of uh deployment uh iteration uh
58:59 - benefit of using a pwg
59:01 - um pwa right so it's going to help you
59:04 - out in that sense
59:05 - but but obviously with that said it's
59:07 - not a native app
59:08 - native apps have a lot of uh sort of
59:11 - pros to using them as well
59:13 - you can tap into the sort of graphics
59:14 - card a lot more you can do a lot more
59:16 - sort of
59:16 - power intensive things you can sort of
59:18 - get to be
59:20 - fair you get the pwas are getting a lot
59:21 - more powerful
59:23 - but um there are pros and cons in our
59:25 - times for example push notifications on
59:27 - ios
59:28 - on a pwa you don't have that right which
59:30 - is why you usually opt for text
59:32 - messaging
59:32 - like twilio or something like that
59:34 - whereas when you're using
59:36 - um a react native you can push
59:39 - notifications and you can do something
59:40 - like firebase cloud messaging to make it
59:42 - work
59:43 - right so that's going to be um
59:47 - so that's going to be something to
59:49 - remember okay
59:50 - now with that said uh what we what we're
59:53 - going to do now is we're actually going
59:54 - to go ahead and build
59:56 - a react native app together with expo
59:59 - and sort of see how that goes and we can
60:02 - go through
60:02 - and run through the teething issues and
60:04 - this and that right
60:06 - um so now let's go ahead
60:09 - and do this so i'm gonna go ahead and
60:12 - share my screen
60:14 - and boom there we go so we got my screen
60:16 - going
60:17 - so i'm gonna move you guys a little bit
60:19 - out of the way for a sec and then i'm
60:20 - gonna go ahead and
60:21 - i'm gonna assume imagine like you're
60:23 - fresh you don't have a
60:25 - single idea about where to begin with
60:26 - this stuff so we're going to go ahead
60:28 - and do it together right so i'm going to
60:29 - go here i'm just going to type in react
60:31 - native
60:32 - right and i'm going to click on this
60:34 - right it's react native and we're going
60:35 - to pretty much it's very
60:36 - it's actually pretty simple to get up
60:37 - and running with this you could get
60:39 - started
60:39 - prerequisites blah blah blah interactive
60:42 - examples you can go ahead and this is
60:43 - expo they have these really nice things
60:45 - i think this is called snack
60:47 - uh is this the snacks that they talk
60:49 - about um
60:50 - i'm kind of still like yeah so that's an
60:53 - embedded snack
60:54 - okay so embedded snack nice one that
60:57 - looks a little bit more
60:58 - like i think if you click the edit or
61:01 - something it brings up kind of like um
61:04 - some kind of like uh yeah i think there
61:06 - like kind of like a small
61:08 - nice awesome so you get like a little vs
61:10 - code trainer
61:12 - cool man so this is this is awesome and
61:14 - what you can actually do is
61:15 - if you click on ios and you click tap to
61:17 - play i think they actually they actually
61:19 - have cloud devices that run so right now
61:21 - i'm queued up in a position so you can
61:22 - actually run this
61:24 - on a um a sort of a free web source
61:26 - thing so look it's actually running on
61:27 - an ios app right now um
61:29 - or on some sort of like cloud phone or
61:31 - something it says device connected
61:33 - and this is a great this is a great way
61:35 - if you put put this up on github or
61:38 - part of your portfolio it's good to have
61:40 - this because
61:41 - someone can just click on it and they
61:42 - can actually run your real app
61:44 - and so it's like you don't you don't
61:46 - necessarily need to have all the stuff
61:48 - approved on apple or anything like that
61:50 - you can just have um
61:52 - like a project that anybody could look
61:54 - at it's very
61:55 - it's very powerful when someone can
61:56 - click and start playing with your app
61:58 - exactly yeah and guys think about it
62:01 - like imagine
62:02 - if you if you could demo your app like
62:03 - this right it's really powerful right so
62:06 - you can go ahead and
62:07 - um let me just move my face because
62:09 - right now on
62:11 - uh youtube i think they can't see it so
62:13 - if i go ahead and hide my face
62:14 - so you guys can see this you say try
62:16 - edit um
62:18 - try editing me one two three if i go
62:20 - ahead and say try enemy
62:22 - someone say yo it's your boy
62:26 - papa react right and then it's i don't
62:29 - even have to hit save and it just kind
62:30 - of dynamically
62:32 - works right and now that's actually
62:33 - running on on a on an ios device right
62:36 - now
62:37 - you see like we didn't have to do any
62:38 - sort of setup right snacks are pretty
62:40 - much
62:40 - a cloud environment everything works out
62:42 - of the box and you can also test it on
62:44 - the web and android
62:45 - and this is another thing if you're
62:47 - doing development or you've never done
62:49 - any kind of native development you will
62:51 - know that setting up the development
62:53 - environments
62:54 - naturally without expo can be quite
62:56 - painful so you're gonna have to set up a
62:58 - bunch of
62:58 - prerequisites and bunch of sort of
63:00 - pre-work to go ahead and get that
63:02 - working and um this saves you a lot of
63:04 - headache
63:05 - when it comes to sort of as uh
63:08 - so what's the advantage of using react
63:10 - native cli over expo
63:12 - so why why do people even use it in
63:13 - production environment and why don't we
63:15 - use just uh
63:16 - expo every single web i don't see people
63:18 - using xp everywhere so
63:19 - yeah could you just mention that good
63:22 - question so
63:23 - firstly expo was relatively newer so
63:25 - well i mean it didn't really catch on as
63:27 - much
63:27 - until like now because when i was using
63:30 - it dude that's exactly what the case was
63:32 - right
63:32 - so i wasn't actually using expo i was
63:35 - using
63:36 - um the react native cli to be honest i
63:39 - had no mention of expo on the site and
63:41 - plus
63:41 - it depends on where you're going into so
63:43 - imagine you go into a company
63:46 - and bedan has um actually just emailed
63:48 - you shrika so
63:49 - i think you have you have a client going
63:51 - on right now so go ahead and check your
63:53 - inbox
63:55 - but imagine you're going to a company
63:57 - and they've been around for a while
63:58 - they've got everything working
63:59 - you want to actually go ahead and and
64:01 - sort of just fit into their sort of
64:03 - current workflow you know you don't want
64:05 - to be like yeah
64:06 - let's revamp everything to use export
64:07 - they'll be like no we've got everything
64:09 - working with android studio and and
64:11 - xcode and the simulator
64:14 - and also it may be more painful to set
64:16 - up
64:17 - but once you have everything set up with
64:19 - xcode and android studio it's still
64:20 - actually pretty good as as an
64:22 - environment but expo is actually
64:24 - export is is really good um but i've
64:27 - actually had quite a lot of success even
64:28 - with using
64:29 - um x uh x x
64:33 - code and android studio um but i was
64:35 - talking about expo
64:36 - yeah good question with the expo
64:40 - do you get like live reloads when you're
64:42 - like coding on on vs codes
64:44 - yes you do yeah and i'll show you i'll
64:47 - show you um
64:48 - because we're going to set everything up
64:50 - now so so we can go ahead and show you
64:52 - but you get everything you still get
64:54 - live reloading hot reloading all that
64:56 - stuff
64:56 - um you get all of this so everything you
64:59 - saw in this little demo that we showed
65:00 - right here
65:01 - you're going to be getting that same
65:02 - functionality um
65:04 - in expo yeah so you don't really need
65:08 - you don't really need android studio
65:09 - though yeah so this is the benefit
65:11 - so anyone who's worked with xcode or
65:14 - android studio before you will know that
65:16 - it it can be clunky there can be sort of
65:18 - like an update and
65:20 - that one update can it's like a couple
65:22 - of gigs sometime and it can kind of stop
65:23 - you from working and
65:25 - it just puts you in a really annoying
65:26 - middle ground whereas with expo
65:29 - what you can do is you can pretty much
65:31 - use their sort of i think it i don't
65:32 - know i mean like i think it's a
65:33 - simulator or something i can't really
65:35 - remember
65:36 - how i haven't used it enough to sort of
65:38 - give you a solid answer on it but the
65:39 - point is it's a lot easier
65:41 - to get up and running with expo than it
65:43 - is with the react native cli
65:45 - um and also once also yeah and also
65:48 - on expo remember you can also always use
65:50 - the expo app on your current
65:52 - uh device and then as you're updating it
65:54 - it'll live reload on your actual
65:56 - app yeah okay on your actual phone yeah
65:59 - oh that's awesome
66:00 - oh yeah yeah
66:07 - yeah yes it will work on cli but it's
66:10 - actually it's very quick to set up with
66:11 - expo
66:12 - yeah i could technically have an apple
66:15 - phone and an
66:16 - android phone like side by side and have
66:18 - it live reload on both and just
66:20 - mess it up yeah they even actually show
66:23 - this in one of their videos they're like
66:24 - hey check this out and they have like an
66:26 - ipad and iphones
66:27 - and it's like yeah it goes across the
66:29 - street yeah
66:30 - that's awesome and i guarantee if i said
66:32 - to you like right i'm going to start a
66:34 - timer
66:34 - and i want you to do it why won't one
66:36 - person do it with this here
66:38 - and then uh let me go ahead and mute
66:40 - whoever that is
66:41 - i can't see my thing frank
66:49 - i think uh yes if i gave two people a
66:52 - timer and i said right go ahead and set
66:54 - up
66:54 - um on and like if i said like an ipad an
66:58 - ios
66:58 - and a different phone and then go ahead
67:01 - and set up that
67:02 - with the cli and then go ahead and stay
67:03 - up with expo the person using export
67:05 - will win
67:06 - by a long shot trust me like it will be
67:08 - so much quicker
67:09 - and then the benefit of this also is
67:11 - like imagine like pedro was building an
67:13 - app right
67:14 - imagine he has a client he's building an
67:15 - app they want a react native app and
67:17 - then imagine like that client said hey
67:18 - like where are we at by the way like
67:20 - work
67:20 - is any any update on the app right now
67:23 - typically what you would do is you could
67:24 - share your screen and do it that way
67:26 - so that's going to be that's going to be
67:28 - cool right
67:29 - i guess it will it will show up running
67:31 - and things like that and
67:33 - as but what if you want to give them
67:34 - that actual kind of you know that that
67:36 - look and feel and they want to play with
67:38 - it themselves and break things and mess
67:40 - around with it
67:41 - so you could be like yeah scan the qr
67:42 - code and imagine that like then they
67:44 - scan it on their phone
67:46 - or you send the qr code to them they
67:48 - scan it on their phone
67:49 - now they get to actually go ahead and
67:51 - play and fill the app which is a whole
67:53 - different experience
67:54 - so obviously like just seeing somebody
67:56 - sharing an app on the on on a website or
67:58 - on a phone is one thing
67:59 - but once you get your phone and you're
68:01 - actually going there going ahead and
68:03 - scrolling through it that's going to be
68:05 - a whole different experience right and
68:06 - then that actually sort of wins that
68:07 - trust
68:08 - a lot easier so cool yeah yeah so that's
68:11 - going to be really powerful so
68:12 - now you can see here's pretty cool as
68:14 - well so we had a question earlier about
68:16 - functional components first class-based
68:18 - components
68:18 - they show you both example here in in so
68:21 - this is how you'd write a class-based
68:22 - component
68:23 - and this cellular function component um
68:26 - functional component so
68:27 - for those of you who don't know about
68:29 - the differences we have if i would
68:31 - recommend
68:31 - we re-watching a lot of the old coaching
68:33 - calls as well
68:34 - because we talk about we talk about this
68:36 - lot like a huge amount throughout
68:38 - some of the coaching calls the
68:40 - difference is how to write one to the
68:41 - other and things like that and go back
68:43 - um so they've been recorded and um but
68:46 - remember most people will say yeah
68:48 - i mean class components are old you
68:50 - don't need to know that only learn
68:51 - functional components
68:52 - i will say to you do not go with that
68:54 - approach i know it's the way that we all
68:56 - want to go because
68:57 - functional components is the best and
68:58 - they're nice and they're fresh and clean
69:00 - and yes if you're writing a new
69:02 - component 100 right in a functional
69:04 - component
69:05 - if you wrote in a class-based component
69:06 - i would kind of like jump through my
69:08 - computer and slap you
69:09 - i'm joking i'm kidding i'm not going to
69:11 - do that but the point is
69:13 - the point is is that you want to go
69:14 - ahead and write in function component
69:15 - but
69:16 - if you go into a company i can guarantee
69:19 - you they're going to have a bunch of
69:21 - like a lot of code which is going to be
69:23 - class-based okay
69:25 - and and you're going to need to work
69:26 - with class-based components so you're
69:28 - going to need to
69:28 - to make sure that works so we're going
69:31 - to go down to getting started where is
69:33 - it um
69:34 - uh we did this before i i couldn't even
69:36 - find against either so we've got core
69:38 - components um i'm gonna click
69:41 - where the heck is the getting started
69:43 - but environment setups out of the
69:45 - development environment
69:46 - okay here we go so expo cli so npm
69:48 - install dash g
69:49 - so i'm gonna open up a terminal make it
69:51 - super big for you guys
69:52 - see let's go ahead and also if you're
69:56 - not using spectacle
69:58 - make sure you download it it's really
69:59 - really handy tool
70:01 - so you can go ahead and just do like a
70:03 - lot of this stuff like rearranging your
70:04 - screen very quick
70:06 - um so it's really handy so i'm gonna do
70:07 - mpm install dash
70:09 - g expo cli which npm dash g
70:12 - install dash g music install that
70:14 - globally so it's going to install across
70:16 - your computer so you don't have to
70:18 - pretty much worry about if you want to
70:19 - use expo commands you can then use
70:21 - things like expo and knit
70:23 - and that will go ahead and allow you to
70:24 - set up an app um
70:26 - brian reading says i've got a question
70:28 - shoot dude on youtube
70:30 - if i see them on youtube i'll try and
70:32 - answer as many as i can
70:33 - um okay so and this is also another
70:36 - question so this is a really good one
70:37 - actually
70:38 - so debasis gracias says is mac required
70:41 - to develop and publish an ios app built
70:43 - using react native so this typically was
70:46 - the breaking point
70:47 - for ios developers so before you kind of
70:50 - needed to have
70:52 - a mac to to write an ios app right you
70:54 - kind of you did you needed like a mic
70:56 - because you needed xcode
70:58 - and if you didn't have xcode like tough
71:00 - you can really do it so you you might
71:02 - get this
71:02 - also guys you might get this error you
71:04 - need to do sudo whenever you do a global
71:06 - install
71:07 - so i'm going to write sudo then i'm
71:09 - going to go ahead and pop in the
71:10 - password there we go
71:12 - um so yeah and another another thing
71:15 - here that people
71:15 - always kind of get confused here sudo
71:18 - what it does is it gives you
71:19 - administrator access to your computer
71:21 - and then when it says password uh
71:25 - this is old school like unix so it
71:27 - doesn't like move forward as you're
71:29 - typing it stays in place
71:30 - so type in your normal password for your
71:32 - computer and it will stay in place and
71:34 - then press enter
71:35 - yeah a lot of people get stuck here like
71:37 - oh how does this work like that's one of
71:39 - the top stack overflow
71:41 - questions for react native exactly it
71:43 - really is
71:44 - actually the top one well one of the top
71:46 - ones one top 10 for sure
71:48 - damn yeah because because that's
71:50 - actually one of those things that i
71:51 - remember when i was first learning in
71:52 - terminal i was like
71:53 - why is nothing coming like nothing's
71:55 - coming on there and then the more i got
71:56 - familiar with linux and unix or stuff
71:58 - you kind of get familiar with that
71:59 - but yeah and this was a password if you
72:02 - don't mind
72:03 - [Laughter]
72:05 - see that's what you gotta watch out for
72:07 - guys
72:09 - that's what we call fishing it's like
72:12 - it's i love maravan
72:14 - yeah yeah i love mm365 that's it
72:18 - um right so what
72:23 - [Music]
72:30 - [Music]
72:34 - motherboard and an intel i7 cpu yeah
72:38 - 700k and what i did was i installed hack
72:41 - and toss on it
72:42 - yeah so like from past one year i it was
72:44 - on mac
72:45 - uh mac os mohawk and like last week i
72:48 - just updated it to catalina
72:50 - nice for ios 14.1 development yeah
72:53 - yes you can smooth we have no problem so
72:56 - it's
72:56 - also very cheap like indian 35
73:00 - 000 rupees you know i was able to create
73:02 - a cpu
73:03 - like with the full pledge nice awesome
73:06 - dude yes you can go the macintosh route
73:09 - um one thing i did want to mention which
73:11 - was the question that was asked before
73:12 - by that
73:12 - uh debauches gracias was that if
73:16 - you don't have a mac right the journey
73:18 - doesn't end there anymore because you
73:20 - have expo
73:21 - all right so expo now unlocks that
73:23 - development so
73:24 - you can then actually carry on with the
73:26 - development you can still build ios app
73:28 - you still got
73:29 - android app you still build a web app
73:31 - all through
73:32 - expo which is really game changer from
73:35 - before a lot of people
73:36 - didn't need um so kgf leak here says yes
73:39 - you need a mac no you don't you don't
73:41 - actually need a mac anymore
73:42 - you can actually still write the code
73:44 - and what you might be able to do is test
73:46 - with an android phone
73:47 - and then publish it to a snack test on
73:49 - one of their cloud sort of ios devices
73:51 - and that would work perfectly and it
73:53 - would work in sort of the way you expect
73:55 - it so
73:56 - you can go around that now uh which is
73:59 - here
73:59 - you still need a mac yes exactly so
74:02 - that's for react native cli you're going
74:04 - to need a mac
74:04 - yeah so that's going to be it it gets
74:06 - even better than this so so like what we
74:08 - do
74:09 - is um i set up a ci environment
74:12 - continuous integration nice so what that
74:14 - allows me to do
74:15 - is as i'm i'm doing everything to do
74:18 - with the code
74:19 - i'm able to push it up on github and
74:21 - then it automatically
74:22 - creates all of this stuff and then
74:25 - pushes it all the way to the test flight
74:26 - the thing that we were talking about
74:28 - before
74:28 - that's a way that you can use uh to test
74:31 - apps on on ios so not only do you not
74:35 - even need a mac
74:36 - like you don't even need any of it so
74:39 - amazing yeah you can do it automatically
74:41 - so um
74:42 - just you know this is the new way of
74:44 - doing it this is why it's very powerful
74:46 - this is why we're talking about it so
74:48 - javascript everywhere
74:49 - literally yeah up and down the whole
74:52 - stack
74:53 - so literally you guys know like you
74:54 - don't need a mac anymore that's a myth
74:57 - if you need uh publishing rights it's
74:59 - not 99
75:00 - anymore i'll show you exactly how to do
75:02 - it um
75:03 - so that's good exactly you can also use
75:06 - a virtual
75:07 - virtual machine not
75:10 - not actually because it's like apple has
75:12 - a like one part of
75:13 - apple that's a little bit tricky is you
75:15 - have to create a certificate it's called
75:17 - a certificate yeah
75:18 - that certificate um it does require
75:21 - certain things it's it's a little bit
75:22 - harder to do there are services that
75:24 - will produce a certificate for you now
75:26 - so you don't even need a mac like that
75:28 - was the last thing holding it out
75:30 - certificate is something that you must
75:33 - use from apple to sign
75:34 - an app to put it up on the app store
75:38 - yeah and also virtual virtual
75:40 - environments get a bit clunky guys like
75:42 - i know
75:42 - they sound ideal but they like i've used
75:45 - them before and i've had to
75:46 - um but if now that i know about this
75:49 - other stuff that's out there
75:50 - i really would stay away from a virtual
75:52 - environment to be honest um there's a
75:54 - lot more other better solutions out
75:55 - there
75:56 - and like frank said if you if you want
75:58 - to go in the route of like devops and
75:59 - things like that or just as a hobby
76:01 - i would really recommend it because i i
76:04 - am pro
76:04 - that with frank because i did the same i
76:06 - set up a bunch of ci
76:08 - and it's so cool when it get when you
76:10 - get it working like you literally push
76:11 - your code and it just does this it does
76:13 - that it does everything else
76:14 - and then at the end of it you've just
76:16 - got all of your stuff that you would
76:17 - have done manually done for you
76:19 - so you can pretty much make it and that
76:20 - kind of goes into the automation world
76:23 - and sort of that sort of side of things
76:25 - but um really valuable by the way
76:27 - as a developer to know that um stuff
76:29 - it's really really like a selling point
76:31 - you can actually market yourself
76:32 - really well as a devops kind of slash
76:34 - full stack um so it helps it helps with
76:36 - your freelance freight
76:38 - also yeah because if you're able to do
76:40 - more things it's like yeah of course
76:42 - i wouldn't want anyone to want to learn
76:44 - that just off the bat if that's not what
76:45 - you want to do but
76:46 - you know you're you're a javascript
76:49 - developer
76:50 - and react developer then you start doing
76:52 - some mobile stuff
76:53 - and then you keep progressing and then
76:55 - one of the final things is being able to
76:58 - have a self-deploying app so that's
77:00 - that's how you kind of level up this
77:02 - whole
77:02 - this whole thing exactly yeah exactly
77:05 - i just have a quick question go for it
77:07 - so here and i want to become a very good
77:10 - uh
77:10 - react and react native developer right
77:12 - yeah and i'm pretty sure that
77:14 - even frank could relate to this so what
77:16 - would be the ideal roadmap for
77:18 - someone like me who is just starting off
77:20 - with react and you know what would be my
77:22 - approach so should i start with classes
77:24 - should i start with functional
77:25 - components and how should i pretty uh
77:27 - you know
77:28 - progress up in that so that you know one
77:30 - day i can uh like even today i can of
77:32 - course go for
77:33 - a cl to a client for all that kind of
77:35 - stuff but
77:36 - right now i want to master react and
77:38 - react native right so what what could be
77:40 - the ideal roadmap for someone like me
77:43 - yeah there's this awesome youtube
77:44 - channel called clever programmer
77:46 - um love it carry on dude go for it
77:50 - i've heard of it um i think it's a
77:52 - really nice prank
77:55 - no i think i think part of it i think
77:56 - part of it is you know some of what
77:58 - sunny was talking about before right
77:59 - like
78:00 - the way that a lot of us got introduced
78:02 - to you know how sunny was doing it was
78:04 - by clones
78:05 - so there is an equivalent in the react
78:08 - native world
78:09 - for the clones so like start checking
78:12 - out some of the the stuff that they're
78:13 - doing
78:14 - try to see like the kind of newer ones
78:16 - uh the ones that are using expo
78:18 - actually the folks from expo they make
78:20 - clones too
78:21 - on expo there's a instagram expo it's
78:24 - like a very full featured uh clone of
78:26 - instagram all built in expo so
78:28 - it's almost like well you want to level
78:30 - up try to try to think about
78:32 - you know that same mentality like
78:33 - projects that are kind of already done
78:35 - um and then take little bits and pieces
78:38 - right deconstruct it try to do it
78:39 - yourself
78:40 - like follow along um so that's a react
78:43 - native route and
78:44 - you know what what sunny is doing you
78:46 - know with with the cone
78:48 - apps on um in in react it's it's the
78:52 - same thing it's like
78:52 - the more projects you do you'll see like
78:55 - you know like doing this
78:56 - this project with you know with the with
78:59 - the fires around me and like all that
79:01 - stuff like building that stuff in expos
79:04 - it's very powerful
79:05 - and if you have access to a device you
79:08 - can see it
79:08 - happening so you can see that red thing
79:10 - that it gives you react native it's like
79:12 - this
79:12 - terrible like this terrible screen that
79:15 - shows you like it just crashes right
79:17 - yeah it shows you how to deal it's it's
79:19 - way worse than just regular
79:21 - react yeah um it's just it's seeing kind
79:24 - of what projects are out there
79:26 - um following along some tutorials like
79:28 - little small stuff
79:30 - but that's that's how you level this
79:31 - part up right because i know that you
79:33 - you're looking at some some stuff like
79:35 - look at like the big projects
79:37 - and then kind of work backwards from
79:38 - there exactly like it literally take on
79:41 - more for everything that frank had
79:42 - pretty much said right now
79:44 - and uh while i'd add to it it's pretty
79:45 - much a case of like in terms of
79:47 - actionable points
79:49 - it there's there's literally like 20 i
79:51 - think 20 25 clones on clever programmer
79:54 - each one targets a different challenge
79:56 - in a different way
79:57 - um so i would recommend that like if you
80:00 - if you kind of feel that like you're
80:01 - hitting a lot of similarities um
80:04 - then go ahead and type check out like a
80:05 - completely different so for example
80:07 - the amazon five-day challenge right that
80:10 - one we did uh stripe payment processing
80:12 - we used cloud functions on the backend
80:13 - we did loads of react front end we done
80:15 - firebase we did authentication
80:17 - everything was inside that build even um
80:20 - estate management with the react context
80:22 - api
80:22 - so we had loads of stuff that was
80:24 - involved in that build what i would
80:25 - recommend for you to do is
80:27 - go ahead and and one build up your
80:28 - pattern recognition by doing the builds
80:30 - right that's going to be the number one
80:31 - best way of just like
80:33 - dialing in on what is needed when do i
80:35 - how do i
80:36 - navigate between pages because you're
80:38 - always going to have these questions but
80:40 - when you actually put them into use
80:41 - cases
80:42 - that's when you're going to be dialing
80:43 - it in and sort of nailing you'll answer
80:45 - a ton of your own questions through them
80:46 - builds
80:47 - um you also run into like frank said you
80:49 - run into a lot of the bugs yourself like
80:51 - where
80:52 - uh react react js itself is very
80:55 - friendly with bugs right it's very quite
80:56 - like it's
80:57 - quite like easy to quickly spot a bug
80:59 - kind of fix it wouldn't say easy but
81:01 - you're going to get into
81:01 - situations where it's kind of like a bit
81:03 - more straightforward react native on the
81:05 - other hand
81:06 - is a lot more painful so what i would
81:07 - recommend is build your stamina with
81:09 - react
81:10 - and then kind of get very comfortable
81:12 - about debugging situations
81:14 - for a lot longer periods of time with
81:15 - react and then
81:17 - go towards react native because react
81:18 - native i definitely feel like you need a
81:20 - lot more patience and sort of um
81:22 - and um yeah patience is the word that
81:25 - would go with the full react native i've
81:27 - been into debugging situations where
81:29 - it's a lot more painful
81:30 - debugging and react native and react
81:32 - native also the dependencies for react
81:35 - when you let's say you install firebase
81:36 - in react you would just do npmi
81:39 - firebase right then you now have
81:40 - firebase inside your app
81:42 - uh if you're doing it with a react
81:43 - native you're gonna need to install
81:46 - the ios dependencies the android
81:48 - dependencies and then you're gonna have
81:49 - some additional kind of steps now there
81:51 - are
81:51 - there is documentation to do that but
81:53 - remember it might work perfectly fine on
81:55 - ios
81:56 - and then android will present its own
81:58 - weird bug
81:59 - so there are things like that that's why
82:02 - i kind of say build your stamina with
82:03 - with
82:04 - react which is a lot more easier to
82:06 - handle this stuff and then go
82:07 - forward and and dive into react native
82:10 - um
82:10 - but what you're doing right now
82:12 - pre-entry is you're being practical so
82:13 - you're actually going ahead
82:15 - landing clients you're not letting that
82:16 - become a block because i guarantee most
82:18 - people on the call right now
82:20 - don't get disheartened that like i don't
82:23 - know
82:23 - enough so i'm not going to put myself
82:25 - out there i would i would flip the
82:27 - script and put yourself out there and
82:29 - figure it out on the job
82:30 - honestly because it's yeah right now i
82:34 - wouldn't say that i'm i'm like i'm good
82:36 - i'm just a beginner that reacts but what
82:38 - do you see
82:39 - quite a lot of times happening is that
82:40 - you know there are going to be clients
82:42 - who want to learn html css javascript
82:44 - right
82:44 - so if you know even if you know html
82:46 - today like standing
82:48 - in one of his calls told us that you
82:49 - know if you know how to make a web page
82:51 - and if you know how to put up a landing
82:52 - page if you can teach that to someone
82:54 - else they can tell you
82:55 - yeah and yeah it's it does seem over
82:58 - exaggerated uh
82:59 - to a certain level but it's not trust me
83:02 - it's not because i i was able to land
83:04 - lines for web development and i wouldn't
83:05 - say that i'm a master web development
83:07 - so i think that anyone else could do it
83:09 - too so if you can you know like make
83:10 - some basic web pages and if you can
83:12 - learn javascript
83:13 - it trust me it hardly takes like a week
83:15 - to learn about
83:17 - html css and maybe a month at max to get
83:20 - good with javascript
83:21 - yeah and yeah i highly agree on the
83:23 - point that you mentioned about you know
83:24 - teaching and taking action
83:26 - and right now i'm gonna try to do that
83:28 - myself so i'm gonna pull up some you
83:29 - know
83:30 - react stuff up and uh i'll check it out
83:32 - sure
83:33 - amazing yeah 100 and just action it
83:36 - move forward with it and every day just
83:38 - make sure that you're either like
83:39 - contributing to it like some kind of
83:41 - build or something practical
83:43 - um because remember theory is like
83:45 - something that we kind of and that's the
83:46 - traditional education system teaches
83:48 - through theory
83:49 - and very little practical flip it just
83:51 - do practical
83:52 - and kind of pick up the theory when and
83:54 - as you need it right and that's gonna
83:56 - really kind of be a lot more beneficial
83:58 - to you
83:58 - and it means that your time is spent a
84:00 - lot better and and you're going to get a
84:02 - lot more return
84:03 - quicker i like to call it the applied
84:05 - computer science
84:06 - yeah like that's so theoretical
84:10 - it's like shut up i just yeah applied
84:13 - yes
84:15 - funny thing is you find out most
84:16 - professors who teach cannot even code to
84:18 - save their lives
84:19 - yes yes they can yeah yeah they can't
84:23 - and my school i found out my professor
84:25 - he
84:26 - had the tas teaching assistants who are
84:29 - you know know what they're doing they
84:31 - would rather uh be the ones to do the
84:33 - recitation so he just
84:34 - has the slices used for decades and just
84:36 - shows them and explains the same
84:38 - stuff and then you go to the recitation
84:40 - and then the tears are the one that will
84:42 - actually help you fix stuff yeah yeah
84:44 - exactly exactly
84:46 - it's like another really good thing
84:47 - about expo is that what we were just
84:49 - showing you with these snacks
84:50 - uh the snacks can be public so there are
84:53 - there's people that publish the snacks
84:55 - and then you can kind of see like okay
84:56 - that's how they did this this is how
84:58 - they did the header part
85:02 - and some people always underestimate the
85:04 - power of going to github and just
85:05 - reading some food
85:06 - up and you know you should do that quite
85:08 - a lot of times like just look at some
85:10 - files and then
85:10 - with pattern recognition again it comes
85:13 - along the way and
85:14 - i think that helped me yeah yeah like
85:16 - like look up like for instance like
85:17 - uh like a firebase expo snack
85:21 - yeah and look that up and if it's not
85:23 - updated i'll update one i'll create one
85:26 - myself i've
85:27 - had expo forever so um it's a good
85:30 - starting place and i think a lot of
85:32 - people will get value from it because
85:33 - then you'll start seeing like what's
85:34 - similar
85:35 - what's different some of the
85:36 - complexities and then run the code on
85:38 - your
85:38 - on your device you're like oh wow i can
85:40 - log in i can do this and that
85:42 - so it it's like we can technically most
85:45 - of what sunny was
85:46 - creating with um what's with some of
85:49 - these cones
85:50 - like maybe not the stripe one because
85:52 - that one has like a little bit different
85:54 - way of doing it but
85:55 - most of the other ones like the twitter
85:57 - clone and you know all of the clones
85:59 - you're able to turn that into like a
86:02 - react
86:02 - native expo experience yes so those kind
86:05 - of things are very
86:06 - very interesting and the the expo snacks
86:10 - are
86:11 - most of them are open most of them have
86:13 - people
86:14 - some of them aren't that good but some
86:16 - of them are really good they have
86:17 - different stars
86:18 - you know they have stars like just like
86:19 - github and check some of them out even
86:21 - though
86:22 - the guys from expo like i said their
86:24 - blog creates a lot of really interesting
86:26 - stuff
86:27 - like the push notifications they they
86:29 - did one with like the guys from pusher
86:32 - that's like another service that's not
86:33 - um that's not uh that that's not
86:36 - firebase
86:37 - that you can get exposed to that all
86:39 - kinds of different things and
86:40 - a lot of the stuff is like there for you
86:42 - for you to check out
86:43 - yeah so right now i'm actually focusing
86:45 - a lot on react so i i what i want to do
86:47 - is
86:47 - get my foot dirty and react first and
86:50 - once i'm quite comfortable with react i
86:51 - started looking to uh react native and
86:54 - try to build my own mobile app one day
86:56 - and uh yeah i definitely take that piece
86:58 - of advice that you just said frank and
87:00 - yeah i highly appreciate it thanks guys
87:05 - nice um one more question
87:08 - where we can use utilize this uh snack
87:10 - dot expo dot io
87:12 - where uh for from uh for building from
87:15 - scratch
87:16 - or uh we can um
87:20 - we can put the code and test it over
87:22 - there building a complete app there or
87:25 - how we can use it you can build you can
87:27 - build a complete act
87:29 - app except for a couple there's a couple
87:31 - small things you can't do
87:33 - so anything that's kind of like ui base
87:35 - is pretty
87:36 - pretty good but some of the stuff and
87:38 - expo snacks they don't have
87:41 - quite all the firebase stuff from the
87:43 - last time i checked all the firebase
87:44 - stuff that's like native
87:46 - um that's not like fully fully solved
87:49 - but they're getting
87:49 - they're getting pretty close um but you
87:52 - can do a lot of stuff there and then
87:53 - and then you run it on your own device
87:55 - like what we were saying before
87:57 - yeah yes we test it okay thank you very
88:00 - much
88:01 - exactly hey sonny hey you did just one
88:04 - more question
88:05 - yep uh like uh uh while we were
88:08 - discussing all these stuffs i just went
88:10 - to slag
88:12 - snack dot expo and i just played with
88:15 - the code and i felt like
88:16 - wow this is react native i mean you just
88:19 - replace a div
88:20 - with the view and then the text and all
88:22 - those things so exactly
88:24 - yeah that's right
88:27 - so what i wanted to ask is uh so
88:31 - if i say that i know uh react uh basics
88:34 - and intermediate stuff like
88:36 - redux and redux sagas and all those
88:38 - stuffs along with all my html and css
88:41 - and
88:41 - all those css and gs skills so what else
88:45 - do i need to
88:46 - transition from that react mindset to
88:49 - react native mindset um so this actually
88:53 - is a good question
88:54 - what i would say is simplify it right so
88:56 - you've already
88:57 - you already know react um think of what
89:01 - um
89:02 - what what frank was just talking about
89:03 - now like the practicality
89:05 - overrides everything so literally go
89:08 - ahead
89:09 - just kind of dive in and look at some of
89:10 - the snacks that are released because
89:12 - like you said like
89:12 - just by looking at a snack you just
89:14 - quickly realized like you quickly
89:16 - defeated that fear
89:17 - right you were like oh my god they're
89:19 - just replacing a div with a view
89:21 - and honestly that's kind of how it goes
89:23 - right like it's it's very small
89:24 - differences
89:25 - um and then you kind of build up from
89:27 - that um and then like rather than using
89:29 - react ruler you use react
89:30 - and native navigation and there's
89:32 - there's small differences like that
89:33 - but the main thing is is that like i
89:35 - would say just go ahead
89:37 - and and and look at the project and
89:39 - maybe set yourself like a little
89:40 - start-up project right so maybe i'll
89:42 - start a project where
89:43 - you're going to need some kind of
89:44 - authentication some kind of navigation
89:47 - and and those kind of things and then
89:48 - just dive into it because honestly like
89:51 - again what you kind of asked there was
89:53 - what theory do i need
89:55 - to know flip it and instead just run
89:58 - head first and do practical
89:59 - and you will answer those questions
90:01 - you'll build up the theory that you need
90:02 - to know
90:03 - um through the actual practical
90:05 - application and thank you so much rika
90:06 - he says hey guys i'm back after reading
90:08 - some lunch oh
90:08 - damn i thought he was leaving um no just
90:11 - a lot of practical talk pretty much
90:13 - um about what you need to like how
90:16 - practical approaches to to um
90:21 - uh to sort of your learning is going to
90:23 - be a lot more
90:24 - uh a lot more beneficial um debashis
90:27 - says thanks only for answering my
90:29 - question i always thought that mac is
90:30 - required to build and publish an ios app
90:32 - but as you said it's no longer needed
90:33 - now this m this makes react me a very
90:35 - powerful yes
90:36 - that makes rea expo in react native very
90:39 - powerful to be a
90:40 - to be super clear uh yeah but you're
90:42 - welcome dude
90:43 - i'm gonna i'm gonna drop a link here for
90:45 - the
90:46 - uh this this guy's name is evan bacon he
90:48 - works for
90:50 - the the guys at expo and he did he did
90:52 - this like
90:53 - massive instagram clone it also includes
90:57 - like
90:58 - crazy stuff like he has like filters in
91:00 - it like you could do a lot of crazy
91:02 - stuff
91:02 - with with expo yeah that's crazy
91:06 - like i've tried it myself and i was like
91:08 - oh my goodness it's gonna take a lot of
91:09 - time
91:10 - yeah check out check out this um check
91:12 - out this this website uh sorry this uh
91:17 - there's also there's also a step-by-step
91:20 - kind of um
91:20 - guide on on their blog it's a little bit
91:23 - outdated so i'm not sure
91:25 - you know i think it was from last year
91:26 - or something like that but there might
91:28 - have been newer things but check out
91:30 - that project it's like
91:31 - you want to know what you could do with
91:32 - with expo you can do a lot
91:36 - exactly yeah you can and then duke is
91:38 - excellent
91:39 - it was only two you said it does look
91:41 - like instagram
91:43 - it was only until you said that frank oh
91:45 - wait have you uh let me go ahead and
91:46 - check this out one second i was just
91:48 - looking at something
91:49 - um okay they've got a demo let me go
91:51 - ahead and try to share my screen i'll
91:52 - share with you guys also publish some
91:54 - blogs about uh
91:55 - react native on clever programmer you
91:57 - know like we all also guys if you're not
91:59 - already reading those vlogs and please
92:01 - check them out
92:01 - we really put a lot of time into it and
92:03 - now i'm thinking of making some content
92:05 - about uh
92:07 - you know blogs about react native i'm
92:09 - gonna do that very soon
92:10 - nice dude is this frank is this using um
92:14 - uh react native or is this yeah this is
92:17 - the
92:18 - it's actually really interesting this is
92:19 - uh the
92:22 - the exfol web version right so they
92:25 - actually have it on
92:26 - if you look at the repo it has like the
92:28 - ios and all that stuff so you could run
92:30 - it
92:31 - um this is kind of like if you
92:34 - if you have it on your um on your if you
92:37 - if you clone it and then put it on your
92:39 - like your own device on expo
92:41 - right it does it does like a bunch of
92:43 - stuff it's it's actually pretty nuts
92:45 - nice yeah oh dope dude so this is
92:48 - actually going to the the web sort of
92:50 - one yeah so they broke it out into three
92:53 - pieces web
92:54 - uh android ios um yeah see look
92:58 - you see like the that's the right
93:00 - components navigation
93:02 - screen and you guys check you can just
93:05 - pretty much look at how they like
93:06 - you might be wondering how do they
93:07 - handle permissions dive into their code
93:10 - you can see look there's some kind of
93:10 - permissions here
93:12 - yeah exactly so it's like you know it
93:14 - allows you to to say hey yes
93:16 - um camera permissions audio recording so
93:19 - then you could like
93:20 - record a little video like this app does
93:23 - quite a bit of stuff
93:25 - exactly yeah so you can pretty much see
93:27 - it here and this is to be honest like
93:29 - uh and you might look at this and be
93:30 - like oh my god it's class based but to
93:31 - be honest like the main thing
93:33 - the main thing is is that there it's
93:35 - showing you how to use it right it's
93:37 - showing you how to go ahead and
93:38 - and you can see they've got a bunch of
93:39 - things they've got some kind of gate
93:41 - action sheet provider audio mode
93:43 - connector and like all of this stuff you
93:45 - can then go ahead and dive into that
93:46 - code and check out
93:47 - so this is actually a really good way of
93:49 - um sort of like
93:51 - widening your breadth and knowledge when
93:53 - it comes to react native
93:54 - um but yeah i would definitely say go
93:57 - ahead check
93:58 - and check that out that looks pretty
93:59 - cool though dude i have a question for
94:01 - frank
94:05 - can we do some programming uh in uh
94:08 - for example if i'm making a video i want
94:11 - to program it you know
94:12 - you know one scene is there then i can
94:14 - click and i will do something but i
94:16 - click here i will do something there
94:18 - is it possible uh in a video
94:21 - using our react or react native or any
94:24 - tool
94:25 - well i'm not sure of your question so
94:27 - you like like to create
94:29 - like i'm i'm streaming we i'm making a
94:32 - streaming video right
94:33 - moving any more short movie okay okay
94:36 - when i click
94:37 - at a particular point during a movie
94:41 - so it will create it will give me an
94:43 - open my app something like that
94:47 - um something you know i think i'm sorry
94:51 - are you saying to record like uh like a
94:53 - video for
94:54 - that of your app working or what what am
94:57 - i no no no
94:58 - i created a movie like we are recording
95:00 - right now
95:01 - right we made this movie after
95:03 - completion of this movie i want to add
95:05 - cc into it
95:06 - and say here what we are talking i want
95:08 - to translate and script in the bottom
95:10 - okay how do i do that so you could
95:14 - you you could make programming so you
95:16 - could make an app
95:17 - right which takes some kind of video
95:19 - source so you can upload some kind of
95:21 - video file to it
95:22 - you could then look at um some kind of
95:26 - library which which could be
95:28 - like i would recommend searching for a
95:30 - library
95:31 - what was that i know a really good way
95:34 - to
95:35 - do this okay go for it dude yeah
95:39 - what you would first want to do is uh
95:41 - okay so
95:42 - create the app okay and then it maybe
95:44 - would ask for like um
95:46 - a video file or maybe a youtube link if
95:49 - you uploaded it to youtube
95:52 - then i i mean it includes like google
95:55 - cloud
95:56 - and stuff like uh
95:59 - if you feed it once you do it in the
96:02 - back end it will send that to
96:05 - um google cloud and then google cloud
96:08 - can do
96:10 - a transcript and then you can also use
96:12 - their nlp api
96:14 - so you can like cross check and see if
96:16 - it's generating the right words
96:18 - and then you can use like cloud
96:20 - translate to translate the different
96:23 - to get different languages and stuff
96:25 - yeah dude that's clever that's smart
96:27 - actually
96:28 - another thing is because my purpose is
96:30 - little bit different
96:32 - for example while um he's talking about
96:35 - sun is talking about react
96:37 - so when he's talking about react there
96:39 - will be a logo of
96:40 - react on the backhand side of it and
96:43 - when i click react
96:44 - logo it will launch uh
96:48 - you know something on react right so
96:51 - what happened
96:52 - what i would recommend here is is to be
96:54 - honest
96:55 - i would i would like to completely
96:58 - honest i would say
96:59 - you want to just it's more of a
97:01 - different approach here i would
97:02 - recommend rather than doing anything
97:04 - like that i would simplify everything
97:06 - and and and build up your skill set in a
97:09 - video editing software
97:10 - uh because because the truth is and then
97:12 - there's host it on youtube and have
97:14 - uh react like icons kind of moving at
97:16 - that point and then you can
97:18 - on youtube you can actually have an
97:19 - overlay at that timestamp where it's
97:21 - clickable
97:22 - that would be my approach if you want to
97:23 - do something like that um
97:25 - you can go ahead and custom build this
97:27 - stuff um so that you can have it but
97:29 - it's it's going to be a bigger app like
97:31 - you're kind of building now like a video
97:33 - editing
97:34 - kind of app which which there's no
97:36 - straightforward answer to
97:38 - you're gonna have to like break down
97:39 - each feature of the app build it out
97:42 - it's not a case of like answering if i
97:44 - want this to kind of like you know kind
97:46 - of move around here how do i do that
97:48 - you're gonna have to kind of work out
97:50 - how do you get this element on the
97:51 - screen how do you interact with the
97:52 - element
97:53 - do you want drag and drop features you
97:55 - see like there's a lot more
97:56 - to break down from that sort of a use
97:58 - case um
98:00 - but guys while we're all sort of like
98:02 - still uh we've still got some energy
98:04 - let's dive into expo
98:06 - right so we spoke a lot about expo today
98:09 - um
98:09 - so we installed expo cli so what i'm
98:12 - going to do is i've just cd
98:13 - into a directory so i'm going to go
98:15 - ahead and say expo
98:17 - init and then i'm going to say exponent
98:19 - i'm just going to say
98:21 - demo app right i'm going to do
98:24 - enter and this is going to go ahead and
98:26 - it says okay
98:27 - we got blank a minimal app is clean as
98:29 - an empty canvas we've got typescript so
98:31 - a bunch of typescript cool stuff
98:32 - happening
98:33 - um i think it was my last coaching call
98:35 - yeah my last coaching call
98:37 - everyone who's interested in typescript
98:39 - go ahead and watch that last one because
98:41 - we delve into a bit of typescript stuff
98:42 - which is pretty cool
98:44 - um yeah
98:49 - i love that yeah make sure you do then
98:52 - go ahead and check it out it should be
98:53 - uploaded
98:54 - um and uh it's gonna be it was pretty
98:56 - cool we ran through some typescript
98:58 - stuff so make sure you do that and then
99:02 - here
99:02 - we're going to go ahead and do um i'm
99:05 - going to do manage workflow blank
99:07 - so i'm going to click on enter and then
99:10 - it's going to download uh
99:12 - using npm to install packages and it
99:14 - will install some dependencies and stuff
99:16 - hopefully at this point everything
99:17 - doesn't break and it kind of goes well
99:19 - um but i'm going to pull up the chat
99:20 - while this is happening so i can see
99:22 - what's going on i also like
99:23 - uh figuring out like how my partner used
99:26 - firebase actually
99:28 - so yeah how you did like uh npmi
99:31 - firebase tools for react and like npm i
99:34 - firebase
99:34 - yep that that's literally what he used
99:39 - oh he used okay so this is a question
99:40 - this is the reason why
99:42 - i was asking this right is you can use
99:44 - that
99:45 - um there are some pros and cons to use
99:48 - like the
99:49 - rn firebase audio to help them out a bit
99:52 - with like some
99:53 - firebase functions okay right okay yeah
99:56 - because you can definitely yeah you can
99:57 - use the the
99:58 - remember react native is still
100:00 - javascript so you can actually use
100:02 - the javascript um sort of libraries
100:06 - with it but react native firebase.io
100:09 - whatever that url is i'm just typing
100:11 - react native firebase library
100:12 - and it'll come up on google that stuff
100:14 - is going to be um
100:16 - uh it's built they've considered other
100:19 - things for example when you log in wait
100:22 - like
100:22 - if you notice whenever we built a clone
100:24 - when you log in and you refresh
100:26 - the app or you kind of come back to the
100:27 - page it will have a sort of initial
100:29 - split second and then it will log you in
100:32 - because it has to kind of cache or check
100:34 - the server and it'll kind of like
100:35 - grab your login details and they'll kind
100:36 - of log you in or like you'll check if
100:38 - there's a cookie store and if
100:39 - if that cookie is signed and and not
100:41 - expired and then i'll log you in
100:43 - right now on the react native library
100:45 - packages there's most likely going to be
100:47 - a frank just dropped it in the chat as
100:48 - well so make sure you go check that
100:50 - um but in the react native one most
100:52 - likely it does a lot more sort of deeper
100:54 - level of caching or another layer of
100:55 - caching so you don't get that like
100:57 - glitchiness
100:58 - and it kind of works seamlessly like you
101:00 - would expect to do so there are
101:02 - reasons to use it but as um shrika
101:05 - showed us like you can use
101:06 - the the sort of regular javascript
101:08 - packages there's nothing wrong with that
101:10 - but just know that there are some
101:11 - differences and there are reasons why
101:13 - you would want to use
101:14 - the um the the sort of packages or
101:17 - libraries like the react native firebase
101:18 - one for example firebase only offer
101:21 - some stuff for example cloud messaging
101:23 - to native
101:24 - platforms which means that you're gonna
101:26 - have to install that kind of library
101:28 - anyway
101:29 - um otherwise you won't be able to access
101:31 - that a b testing remote config
101:33 - all that cool firebase stuff um you need
101:35 - to go ahead and do that so
101:36 - yeah also like another thing is because
101:38 - like uh the react native firebase that
101:41 - kind of like gave him
101:42 - a little bit more issues that's why he
101:44 - kind of used the
101:46 - yeah instead so so this is a that's
101:49 - actually a really good topic
101:50 - um and to quickly touch base on so um
101:54 - yeah so as freaky said like you're going
101:56 - to run into more
101:58 - of more kind of resistance when you're
102:00 - using the react native libraries because
102:02 - there's it's no longer just a simple
102:04 - install command you now have to do ios
102:06 - dependencies and
102:07 - something like pod in store so you have
102:08 - to install ios pods and stuff like that
102:11 - then you have to install um android and
102:13 - you have to mess with i think it's
102:14 - gradle
102:15 - i remember i'm quite it's been a while
102:17 - since i touched that
102:18 - yeah yeah it's like is that great or
102:21 - stuff
102:22 - yeah you're gonna have some kind of
102:23 - dependencies for android but you have to
102:25 - like cd into each one and do an install
102:28 - ios is definitely pod in store and
102:29 - things like that but then the thing is
102:30 - right
102:31 - install might work and then you go to
102:32 - android install and it breaks so you're
102:34 - gonna have to like debug the two
102:36 - separate things
102:36 - and then it comes together and then it
102:38 - works so it's not as quick
102:40 - setting it up but remember a lot of
102:42 - people have put like
102:43 - a lot of love and soul into into these
102:45 - libraries and
102:46 - uh and they work and and huge teams have
102:50 - come together to make it work
102:51 - and they've ironed out a lot of the
102:53 - problems so i would recommend using it
102:55 - but if you run into a situation where
102:57 - you can't use it for whatever reason you
102:59 - can't you've been debugging for ages
103:01 - the first thing i'll say is find a
103:02 - mentor that you can kind of jump to
103:04 - don't quit
103:05 - but the second thing is don't let that
103:06 - be a blocker like like for example
103:08 - shriek is a perfect example he didn't
103:10 - let it block him
103:11 - he had a time frame imagine if you have
103:12 - a client and they they're willing to pay
103:14 - you money or and it's a case of you're
103:16 - going to lose
103:17 - that client if you don't learn that job
103:20 - i would pretty much say
103:21 - just use whatever you can use and slowly
103:24 - slowly you will get better with that
103:25 - step
103:26 - with that tech stack but you're going to
103:28 - lose the opportunity if you don't do
103:29 - anything
103:29 - all right so i would say make it work
103:31 - and then yes like
103:32 - i guarantee like i look back at old code
103:34 - now and i'm like god damn it why did i
103:36 - do that why did i like
103:38 - that's a terrible way of doing it um but
103:40 - you're the only way you're gonna learn
103:42 - it's the only way that you're actually
103:43 - gonna progress is the only way that
103:45 - you're actually gonna go ahead and
103:46 - um and and do that right um
103:50 - oh frank i sent you a dm on slack
103:54 - you said frankie diem on slack yeah yeah
103:59 - uh quick question about the architecture
104:01 - of the reg native do we use um
104:03 - do you use recruiter for on rec native
104:07 - or does it have a different way of
104:08 - like changing from page to page um so
104:11 - you don't use react router on on react
104:15 - native use react native navigation and
104:17 - there's also
104:18 - there's like a battle of which best
104:20 - navigation library to use but i
104:22 - remember we switched our previous
104:23 - workplace from
104:25 - one of the popular ones to react native
104:27 - navigation and then that picked up quite
104:29 - a lot so a lot of people use react
104:30 - native navigation
104:31 - um there are a few it's good to know
104:34 - those good question
104:35 - there are a few different uh navigation
104:36 - libraries whereas with the react
104:38 - uh js so react.js meaning uh the sort of
104:41 - web stuff
104:42 - that's going to be pretty much react
104:43 - each time so recruiter is a lot more
104:46 - sort of in the lead on that front
104:47 - but um or you'll have something like
104:50 - next js
104:52 - um and that's going to be a bit
104:53 - different you know
104:55 - yeah sunny sunday we should cover next
104:56 - year's yeah we should we should
104:58 - definitely do
104:58 - maybe like some server side sort of
105:00 - stuff because that's a whole other way
105:02 - of thinking
105:02 - server side rendering it it can really
105:05 - it can
105:06 - throw you off a bit like it can be a bit
105:08 - kind of confusing
105:09 - and i was like oh my what all do i have
105:12 - to do i was like okay let's just get
105:14 - back to basics of react
105:15 - yeah exactly when we go and
105:18 - uh for any work like that you know they
105:21 - need a
105:22 - lot of things together and it is very
105:26 - difficult to remember each and
105:27 - everything
105:28 - expect in in an interviews
105:31 - so how do you prepare your preparings
105:34 - only based on the questions or you do
105:36 - do you prepare yourself you know one at
105:38 - a time
105:39 - like if you are going it means i have a
105:41 - two
105:43 - skills like react and angular both right
105:46 - then
105:47 - it is very difficult for me to grasp
105:50 - both so remember firstly the chances are
105:54 - yeah the chance i wouldn't want i
105:56 - wouldn't try and master
105:58 - react in angular because you're kind of
106:00 - conflicting two different libraries like
106:02 - as in i would i would focus on
106:03 - like because you're okay put it this way
106:05 - if even if you did do really good
106:07 - with both imagine what you would do if
106:09 - putting all your effort to one
106:11 - right and and i'd recommend react
106:13 - because of the market demand and things
106:14 - like that
106:15 - now what you want to do is you want to
106:17 - change your mindset and approach to the
106:18 - situation as opposed to the way you're
106:20 - looking at it right now which is
106:22 - um you know like there's so much to
106:24 - learn like isn't there so much what do i
106:26 - go into the interview with
106:27 - and things like that like remember we we
106:29 - want to move away from this theory
106:31 - mindset
106:32 - right of like you know like i need to
106:34 - know this i need to know this i need to
106:35 - know that
106:36 - move away from that and instead get
106:39 - practical
106:40 - hands-on experience right get practical
106:42 - hands-on
106:43 - yeah and and sort of run into the
106:45 - debugging situations yourself realize
106:47 - okay
106:48 - i needed react router to to overcome
106:50 - pagering and things like that i needed
106:52 - i ran into a state management problem at
106:54 - which point redux was the answer and
106:56 - redux
106:57 - allowed me to solve this problem now
106:59 - what happens is
107:00 - you have a wide breadth of knowledge
107:02 - which is which has been ingrained so
107:04 - deep because that debugging session
107:06 - lasted
107:06 - six hours when you had to figure it out
107:09 - right and then whereas if you read it
107:10 - simply in a medium article
107:12 - yeah sure you might have understood it
107:13 - in that one hour but i can guarantee
107:15 - debugging it for six to eight hours or
107:17 - something like that or a week sometimes
107:19 - it's taken me a week to sort of overcome
107:20 - some problems before
107:22 - um and i tell you i never forget that
107:24 - that week
107:26 - and what i learned because the pain and
107:28 - the sort of you know doubting yourself
107:30 - and all the sort of trauma that it gives
107:31 - you
107:31 - um that stuff is what really like that
107:34 - you really learn
107:34 - right like it's just like if you're
107:36 - riding a bike and you trip up on the
107:37 - bike and you really
107:38 - like break your leg i can guarantee
107:41 - you're going to ride your bike a little
107:42 - bit better from that moment on so you
107:44 - don't do the same thing
107:45 - right and you're never going to forget
107:46 - that so it's the same with coding like
107:47 - you really just
107:48 - and i would say take it with that
107:50 - approach and you'll be very
107:52 - much more susceptible to answering
107:54 - questions
107:55 - um that get thrown at you and remember
107:57 - like frank said if you don't know the
107:59 - answer to a question it's only honestly
108:01 - better to say like look i don't know the
108:02 - answer to that
108:03 - but show that you're open-minded so that
108:04 - you can kind of approach it differently
108:06 - or try and like
108:07 - re-adjust the question and be like okay
108:09 - but maybe were you talking about like
108:10 - state management so say somebody asked a
108:12 - question about redux and you had no idea
108:13 - about what redux
108:14 - is then you could be like okay i haven't
108:17 - actually used redux but
108:18 - um but but you're talking about state
108:21 - management within an
108:22 - app right and then they can then you can
108:24 - kind of like direct the conversation
108:26 - around that and then you can be like
108:27 - okay so yeah and then you might have
108:29 - used something else so i actually had
108:30 - this question from me
108:32 - and i had i hadn't used redux but i had
108:34 - used something called flux
108:36 - uh and i redirected the question to flux
108:38 - instead and i was like yeah so i would
108:39 - actually do that
108:40 - um and i would and and i'm happy to
108:42 - learn redux and pick it up
108:44 - if it's what is used in this situation
108:47 - yeah play play to your strengths
108:48 - especially like if you're kind of just
108:50 - getting started
108:52 - it's this is what everybody and this
108:54 - call needs to understand
108:55 - it is a rare day that that someone asks
108:59 - you something
109:00 - extremely advanced for a position that's
109:03 - you know getting started right
109:04 - react is kind of new it's like it's been
109:07 - around it's been battle tested but it's
109:09 - still kind of new so
109:11 - don't don't like worry about like what
109:12 - the recruiters are telling you or like
109:14 - the hr
109:15 - people are telling you like oh you need
109:16 - to have 20 years of react it's like what
109:18 - are you talking about it doesn't exist
109:19 - right
109:20 - so try to get past the people that are
109:23 - the gatekeepers that are saying like you
109:24 - need 20 years of react and say
109:26 - hey i'm really really strong here's my
109:28 - beautiful portfolio
109:30 - here's my amazing like you know
109:33 - my my amazing uh resume that frank
109:36 - helped me with like
109:37 - this is this is gonna look amazing and
109:39 - then it you start getting past the
109:41 - people that are like the gatekeepers
109:43 - and then you get to the person who who
109:45 - was like interviewing
109:47 - and then when you're there with the
109:48 - interviewer and say hey
109:50 - like are you gonna make me invert a
109:52 - binary tree
109:54 - to change like the color of a button
109:57 - like this just be real this is like this
110:00 - is this can't
110:01 - you know it has to match like if you're
110:03 - if you're only offering like
110:05 - you know like a more entry-level kind of
110:08 - like salary it's like
110:10 - don't expect me to invert binary trees
110:13 - and
110:13 - no you know be like one of the core
110:16 - contributors of
110:17 - you know redux because that doesn't
110:20 - match up
110:21 - because i understand that like in the
110:22 - beginning um it's more forgiving but
110:26 - always be really persistent because like
110:28 - sometimes the gatekeepers
110:29 - which is like the human resource folks
110:32 - or
110:33 - the recruiters and stuff like that they
110:34 - don't know anything about programming
110:36 - yeah they 100 don't so they're looking
110:39 - for all these like keywords inside your
110:40 - resume
110:42 - i know how to mess with those algorithms
110:43 - to put the keywords in
110:45 - who cares if you know it or not right
110:47 - get to the person
110:48 - who is the person that you want to talk
110:51 - to and have a strong
110:52 - portfolio strong resume and that'll get
110:54 - you to
110:55 - to to that that place that you're
110:57 - talking you guys are talking about
110:58 - exactly that's right that's golden man
111:01 - because honestly
111:02 - then this is a real truthful point is if
111:04 - you
111:05 - imagine you're not surrounded by anyone
111:07 - or any developer community or any sort
111:09 - of mentor right
111:10 - now imagine if a recruiter's job is to
111:13 - land you in a position because they get
111:14 - commission on a perm
111:16 - every time someone lands a job right so
111:18 - if angular is hot right now even if
111:20 - react is what you should be learning
111:22 - if angular is hot they're going to push
111:23 - you to angular they're going to be like
111:25 - um they're like you need to know angler
111:27 - you need to know this this this you need
111:28 - to know uh sas
111:30 - sas is really important to know sas um
111:32 - and they're just kind of they're like
111:33 - frank says it's all buzz words they just
111:35 - they have no idea how to use this stuff
111:36 - they kind of just like
111:37 - yeah this is this this and then i'm
111:39 - telling you they literally list out
111:41 - things and it's quite funny now like if
111:43 - i jump on a call with a recruiter
111:45 - and hearing them trying to sell me on a
111:47 - react job because they were
111:49 - they're telling me like you need to know
111:51 - this you know you need to know this you
111:52 - need to know this and i'm like oh yeah
111:53 - okay cool cool like i'm just really busy
111:55 - right now i kind of need to go
111:56 - um but the point is is that this is so
111:59 - true like i've seen
112:00 - i've seen up work like um client
112:03 - proposals
112:04 - and all they actually need is just like
112:06 - in a basic html css website
112:08 - and some people are so stubborn about
112:10 - react they'll be like you need to
112:12 - implement react
112:13 - you just need to implement read without
112:15 - any reason at all yeah
112:17 - i haven't played any beginner
112:18 - programming but also do the same project
112:20 - but they will also always make him
112:22 - you know like you need to learn yet and
112:24 - those things i i i don't i never liked
112:26 - those kinds trust me
112:27 - yeah and then the thing you want to be
112:29 - careful about with that is is that you
112:30 - don't want the recruiter to to be the
112:33 - one directing you about what you need to
112:35 - learn or not
112:35 - right because remember they might be
112:37 - telling like as in a recruiter might
112:39 - literally come up to you and say
112:40 - um yeah like uh um like you you'll be
112:44 - you're using react and and yeah you
112:46 - don't want to be
112:47 - like this is a hypothetical for example
112:49 - but they might be like yeah don't touch
112:51 - firebase yeah five nobody uses firebase
112:53 - everyone's using sql server yeah you
112:54 - know don't do that
112:55 - and because you you're not surrounded by
112:57 - a developer community you're not
112:58 - surrounded by anyone
112:59 - you wouldn't know otherwise you'd be
113:00 - like well they're the ones that are
113:01 - landing the jobs they they know right so
113:03 - now you've just lost out on learning
113:05 - about an amazing tour like firebase
113:07 - which will actually be booming trust me
113:09 - in the future like that
113:10 - it has a future ahead of it um and also
113:13 - like firebase it would have
113:15 - sort of talked you towards the nosql
113:17 - route and so you would have picked up no
113:18 - sequel on that
113:19 - journey and it's a fun way to learn it
113:21 - so you would have gone in really easy
113:23 - with
113:23 - little resistance but if you listen to
113:26 - the recruiter
113:27 - then you would have been kind of tempted
113:28 - to go the other way and now your time
113:30 - isn't as well spent and it's also a case
113:32 - of
113:32 - but the ques the main thing is right is
113:34 - that how do you avoid this one surround
113:36 - yourself with the community because then
113:37 - you can quickly validate if it's true or
113:38 - not
113:39 - right you can come to the community and
113:40 - say hey guys like where is it did anyone
113:42 - land a job okay okay what
113:43 - what what like what have you found that
113:45 - you need in that job pretty much and you
113:46 - can kind of
113:47 - you know validate the answer and kind of
113:49 - find out the truth and right now in this
113:50 - if you could ask us right now like what
113:52 - do you think i should learn
113:54 - and i would tell you like like we said
113:55 - build out the clones build out the sort
113:57 - of
113:57 - breakdown the clones what did they
113:58 - consist of you'll start to see the
114:00 - patterns yourself
114:01 - that's going to be the real interesting
114:03 - sort of like that's going to be the sort
114:04 - of golden nugget
114:05 - i'd like to refer to them as and that's
114:07 - going to be the one that's going to land
114:08 - you that position
114:09 - and then forget all the other buzzwords
114:11 - because web development is so trendy
114:14 - that like honestly one thing could come
114:15 - into come into trend tomorrow and then
114:17 - and and everyone's on it and then
114:20 - something else will change and
114:21 - everyone's on that
114:22 - and but the one thing i'll tell you is
114:23 - react is here to stay like as in
114:24 - reactors definitely here to stay it will
114:26 - last here
114:27 - for for a substantial number of years
114:29 - and by that point
114:30 - whatever's next it will be pretty easy
114:32 - to probably transition into it
114:34 - based on the things you pick up with
114:35 - react so that would be my advice towards
114:38 - towards handling all that stuff one
114:40 - thing has happened with me
114:41 - when i was you know verizon was
114:45 - interviewing me uh for a position where
114:48 - this is the major skill set is uh
114:50 - um react and javascript
114:55 - and css these are the you know
114:58 - required screen set but angular was
115:00 - there too
115:02 - and they spent an hour with me in uh
115:06 - javascript yep and um
115:09 - react okay but now they came
115:12 - you know there was a third person who
115:14 - was in good in
115:16 - angular now when he comes to the angular
115:18 - then
115:19 - means i started but i was blank out
115:22 - because it's it's just too much for me
115:23 - to uh
115:25 - give each and every aspect of the
115:28 - questions
115:30 - so even if i tell a little bit tell me
115:32 - more about it but
115:33 - my my brain freezes after some time you
115:35 - know
115:36 - it is very difficult to go back into the
115:38 - programming of angular and then give
115:39 - them a
115:40 - practical usage of angular to be honest
115:43 - what what you've probably experienced
115:44 - there is more of an edge case like if
115:46 - you've gone for a job bro and
115:48 - the job is react um it would either
115:51 - yeah if it would be react then i would
115:54 - if they're using react for one thing
115:56 - angler for another thing i mean
115:57 - in most cases it would typically just
116:00 - stay as react you wouldn't get react
116:01 - and angular in that job right and if and
116:03 - if you do i'd kind of asked him i'd be
116:04 - like well what are you guys doing here
116:06 - like
116:07 - it's like how it's like are you guys
116:09 - attempting to migrate
116:11 - an old angular app and to react that's
116:14 - that's a common thing
116:15 - yeah that's right it's like it's like
116:17 - they're they're the people who know
116:19 - react really well and know angular
116:21 - really well are like
116:22 - i couple dozen people that i know
116:26 - personally and so it's like and those
116:29 - people charge so much for it that it's
116:30 - almost like
116:32 - that's a very specialized kind of use
116:34 - case again like this is all about
116:36 - asking questions like hey guys why in
116:38 - the hell do you have
116:39 - angular and react in one
116:43 - in one interview and also are you going
116:45 - to ask them to invert binary trees
116:47 - to change your your your button colors
116:50 - yeah right so
116:51 - you have to you have to ask them like oh
116:53 - what
116:54 - what would what's the purpose of this is
116:56 - this like an internal tool
116:58 - are you guys migrating from angular to
117:00 - react right like try to
117:01 - because then it's like then they're like
117:03 - okay this person is asking questions
117:04 - that are relevant
117:05 - to what we do it's like ah yeah we have
117:07 - like this old
117:09 - angular app we're trying to get to react
117:11 - because every other part of the
117:12 - enterprise is upgrading it
117:14 - you know we our back end is is this but
117:17 - you know
117:17 - we need some help doing that it's like
117:18 - okay now i know that it's not
117:21 - an angular interview it's like a
117:24 - migration interview it's like well
117:26 - this is kind of how i would approach it
117:27 - i would start encapsulating these
117:29 - functions
117:30 - right this function and then and then to
117:32 - convert that to a functional component
117:34 - and react right
117:35 - it changes the conversation but it makes
117:37 - you it puts you into their mindset of
117:39 - like
117:40 - why they would have such different
117:43 - such different like things inside of one
117:47 - inside of one um they said they acquired
117:49 - couple of the companies
117:51 - that's exactly the number yeah and they
117:54 - want to maintain
117:54 - rising and they buy exactly they buy a
117:57 - lot of crap
117:58 - so it's like yes that's exactly it's
118:01 - migration
118:01 - they said it is a not a migration they
118:04 - said initially you have to add bustle
118:06 - and this is here and there
118:08 - so one time you are in this project okay
118:10 - so it's it's basically
118:12 - what they call it's like it's called the
118:14 - scoop out like this happens a lot of
118:15 - startups they'll buy it
118:17 - whatever technology is currently there
118:18 - they support it for a little bit longer
118:20 - until they know what it does and then
118:21 - they scoop it out
118:23 - yep they take the best parts of it and
118:26 - they scoop it out
118:27 - and it's okay again like that
118:29 - conversation you have with the verizon
118:31 - people if you know this kind of stuff
118:32 - and you talk to people like me that are
118:34 - more senior
118:35 - we kind of know what's going on then
118:37 - then it becomes like
118:39 - you become a better like you become more
118:42 - valuable to them and it's like
118:43 - maybe right now you weren't able to do
118:46 - the
118:46 - angular and the react stuff but maybe
118:49 - you could
118:50 - you know pick up some books or something
118:51 - on or some some
118:53 - some ideas of how to migrate an
118:56 - angular app right so you become better
118:58 - and better and it's okay to go back
119:00 - there in six months and say hey guys
119:02 - you know i know that this position was
119:04 - still there i was thinking about it like
119:05 - here's here just a little quick email
119:07 - and i guarantee you they will
119:09 - probably still have that piece of
119:10 - software there yeah
119:12 - and it was amazing they said can we
119:16 - club the two applications together
119:18 - banana angler and another
119:21 - i'd say absolutely it's uh 200 us
119:23 - dollars per hour
119:24 - yeah exactly we could do anything
119:28 - yeah that means it's uh too much what
119:30 - they ask me
119:31 - of course a tool because again because
119:33 - they don't they don't know it well
119:35 - like yeah they're trying to get they're
119:37 - trying to do the best they can like we
119:38 - have this legacy app
119:40 - that is kind of not fitting into our
119:42 - thing we want to make it
119:43 - we want to make it better i said i told
119:45 - them that there is another tool which is
119:47 - essential
119:48 - which is an extgs then i have to learn
119:51 - that too much is together
119:52 - but without that i can't but i have to
119:54 - learn it what i would say at all is is
119:57 - for the sort of
119:58 - in terms of what you're going to get
119:59 - back in terms of like what you can do
120:01 - now
120:02 - as an actionable point i would say
120:05 - in this case i would say like like frank
120:07 - said there's a there's a small number of
120:09 - people who are really really
120:10 - uh sort of specialized with react and
120:13 - angular right and if they are
120:14 - the chances are that of them being up to
120:17 - date with both
120:18 - is going to be even lower right so
120:20 - they're going to they will either be
120:21 - like they'll
120:22 - know how to transfer one from another
120:23 - now what i would say is if in the case
120:25 - of
120:26 - going ahead and and in that job
120:28 - situation
120:29 - even even i even if they came to me and
120:31 - said like hey something like
120:32 - would you would you mind like migrating
120:34 - this angler app to this reactor to be
120:36 - honest i
120:36 - probably wouldn't take the job like i'd
120:37 - kind of like look elsewhere but there's
120:39 - plenty of jobs
120:40 - out there i'll probably go ahead and i'm
120:42 - i'm more focused on being react
120:44 - specialized as opposed to react and
120:45 - angular
120:46 - and the jack-of-all-trades right because
120:48 - i know that if i'm really good with
120:49 - react
120:50 - i can charge a premium for that right
120:52 - like i can i can go ahead and i can be
120:54 - like you can charge quite a good uh rate
120:56 - for that as well
120:57 - but like frank said the more there's
120:59 - like a niche
121:00 - specialized area you can charge an
121:03 - immense amount because there's less
121:04 - people but
121:05 - that means there's less opportunity
121:06 - because it's also a niche right
121:08 - which means that like so in terms of
121:10 - what you want to do now i would say
121:11 - spend your time
121:13 - investing into sort of react front and
121:15 - development uh
121:16 - fight find your feet with that stuff
121:18 - first and then kind of move into
121:19 - building a back end
121:21 - um so a lot of the clones we do back in
121:23 - builds then you'll kind of
121:24 - cover a full stack ground have loads of
121:26 - stuff on your portfolio and then push
121:28 - for the react jobs
121:29 - i'd say all full stack jobs i'd say go
121:31 - that route um
121:32 - it's going to benefit you long term it's
121:34 - going to mean that you're you you're
121:35 - going to build some kind of security for
121:37 - the long term as well
121:38 - because imagine angular suddenly dies
121:40 - tomorrow and you've spent all these
121:41 - months
121:42 - um going ahead and learning both and
121:45 - react took over now you've just suddenly
121:47 - wasted
121:47 - not wasted but you pretty much you've
121:50 - lost a lot of time where if you had
121:52 - just drove through one route it's like
121:54 - trying to say i'm going to be the best
121:55 - basketball player
121:57 - the best football player the best tennis
121:58 - player the best cricketer
122:00 - yeah you're never going to be the best
122:01 - on one of them and you're probably not
122:02 - going to be hired by the best team
122:04 - whereas if you're just like i'm going to
122:05 - be the best football i'm going to put
122:06 - every ounce of my effort into that
122:09 - you're probably going to get picked up
122:10 - by a premier league team and you're
122:11 - going to get paid big bucks
122:13 - right and that's going to be the
122:14 - difference between that kind of
122:15 - lifestyle
122:16 - and the guy who's trying to like
122:17 - accomplish everything is immensely
122:19 - different
122:20 - right so you can have immense
122:21 - differences with that yeah and also and
122:23 - also remember the the prime
122:25 - focus for companies is to get as much
122:28 - value as they can
122:30 - from productivity of a developer right
122:32 - so
122:33 - it's like sometimes they'll say really
122:35 - weird stuff
122:36 - just to try to push you in one direction
122:39 - or another direction
122:40 - and it's it might not you have to decide
122:42 - what's good for you not
122:43 - not what's best for the company right
122:45 - because like
122:46 - like you know what sunny was saying is
122:48 - that you could be the best
122:49 - angular person in the world and then
122:52 - angular
122:53 - is not as useful anywhere there's far
122:56 - less jobs
122:57 - so it's like you kind of like limiting
122:59 - yourself versus like focusing on like
123:02 - a more junior kind of react developer
123:04 - position that has
123:05 - more more upside to grow like we've just
123:08 - showed you examples of
123:10 - just all in react you could do uh an
123:12 - amazing web app which i
123:14 - you know i've showed sony this i i made
123:16 - a dashboard
123:18 - for for sonos and then i also i'm
123:20 - building the app for them
123:22 - all this is all together it's all the
123:24 - same code base
123:25 - it's all react so it's like imagine how
123:28 - imagine as a developer how infinitely
123:32 - more productive i am to to them
123:36 - by being able to do those kinds of
123:37 - things versus like if you know if they
123:40 - needed a
123:41 - angular front end and they had to switch
123:42 - to the react native
123:44 - and it's it's all over the place and
123:46 - it's like it's not good to
123:48 - it's hard to switch that context when
123:49 - you're in the middle of like coding
123:51 - yeah it's it's a real pain and it's very
123:53 - hard to do so
123:54 - you're less productive so yeah try to
123:56 - see
123:58 - like try to try to get hired by someone
124:00 - who wants to
124:01 - grow you grow with you in a certain
124:03 - direction don't like
124:05 - whatever they're saying it's like you
124:07 - have to be yet because you have to do
124:09 - the hard work yourself right so you have
124:10 - to be motivated
124:12 - and if you're just if you're just
124:13 - updating an old angular app and trying
124:15 - to do pieces together with sencha and
124:17 - all that stuff
124:17 - you're saying like that's a nightmare
124:20 - it's not fun
124:21 - exactly and the point
124:26 - for a while having that that back and
124:27 - forth decision and usually what they'll
124:29 - try and do is that they'll kind of like
124:31 - either a they'll give up or or b they'll
124:33 - they'll throw a salary up
124:35 - and they'll be like all right yeah we'll
124:36 - pay you x amount don't let that salary
124:38 - determine your decision right because
124:40 - trust me it might seem like oh like
124:42 - this is paying me so much more
124:44 - than than all the other sort of react
124:46 - jobs i'm being offered to at the level
124:47 - i'm at right now
124:48 - but remember it's about like frank said
124:51 - like you're you're going to be
124:52 - infinitely productive if you choose to
124:53 - react real and it's and it's here to
124:55 - stay
124:55 - it's got like a future ahead of it now
124:57 - you've also got the freelancing the
124:59 - coaching that the full-time jobs
125:00 - you can make a ton of money going in
125:03 - that route
125:04 - whereas this other that you might do
125:05 - yeah sure you're going to get like an
125:06 - extra 10k maybe in salary or something
125:08 - like that
125:09 - but you're going to be limited you're
125:10 - also going to be niched so you're kind
125:12 - of like
125:12 - you're literally putting a box around
125:14 - your skill set as opposed to what you
125:16 - can offer at that point in time
125:18 - whereas if you put the time into
125:19 - dedicated to building out your react
125:21 - skills you're going to be a lot more
125:22 - valuable to a lot more people
125:24 - and that book in its in return will like
125:26 - remember value
125:27 - is what you want to focus on money is
125:29 - the lagging indicator it will come
125:31 - you just focus on your money uh your
125:33 - your value and and everything else kind
125:35 - of follows with it
125:36 - yeah and also imagine the kind of teams
125:38 - that they would have right like you're
125:39 - going to look to your left and to your
125:40 - right
125:41 - and they're not going to teach you react
125:42 - because maybe they're just in
125:44 - you know in in you know some other
125:48 - kind of like more enterprise role which
125:50 - is okay
125:51 - if you want to do enterprise development
125:53 - stuff but it's
125:54 - you might not like i learned the most
125:56 - from other people i work with
125:58 - like i'm working with the team at sonos
126:00 - and they're doing some incredible
126:02 - just crazy just you know top secret ai
126:07 - music stuff like it's incredible but i'm
126:10 - learning from them
126:11 - right and it's like just when you think
126:13 - you can't learn enough
126:14 - or more stuff it's like i'm i'm making a
126:17 - react native app
126:19 - for something that i've been doing for
126:20 - years at this point i've made a lot of
126:22 - apps for movie studios and all this kind
126:24 - of video heavy stuff but i've never done
126:26 - a music thing and i was like okay i
126:27 - guess this is my music thing
126:28 - and okay they let me do it react native
126:31 - somehow i convinced them after showing
126:33 - them sonny's thing
126:34 - right it's like and but i'm but i'm
126:37 - growing as a developer
126:38 - right like i'm not i'm not i'm not stuck
126:40 - in like oh
126:41 - this has to be kind of coded in you know
126:44 - jquery
126:45 - html page right like that's not where
126:47 - you want to be it's like
126:48 - oh like you know i'm i'm growing this
126:51 - way
126:53 - i want to take the company on that
126:55 - journey with me so that
126:57 - more people can help contribute to this
126:58 - code because like once
127:00 - once this is completed all of the other
127:02 - people that are there can learn a lot
127:04 - from this like
127:05 - this app exactly it's like you know once
127:08 - you start seeing how it works and
127:09 - everything like that that's that's what
127:11 - you want to do you want to think about
127:12 - your your future not like their future
127:14 - yeah they don't care because they don't
127:15 - care about you anyways so it's like
127:17 - it's true yeah i haven't focused on
127:20 - react now
127:21 - because it is very hard for me to one in
127:24 - two comes in a react another comes into
127:26 - a
127:27 - uh angler it was very hard for me yeah
127:29 - because i prepared
127:31 - they give only two three days another
127:32 - because i am
127:34 - struggling for the job if we take if we
127:36 - take that if we take that mindset
127:38 - then someone else is going to come with
127:40 - c plus plus and you'll be like ah now
127:41 - i'm going to study c plus plus some
127:42 - somebody comes to java
127:44 - now i'm going to take java i'm going to
127:45 - be uh the best copo programmer in the
127:47 - world
127:47 - yeah the most important things when
127:49 - you're doing freelancing and all that
127:50 - kind of stuff is also it's always going
127:52 - to be
127:52 - saying no right if you're not good at
127:54 - something and if you
127:55 - if you think that you know it's not
127:56 - right for you like
127:58 - trust me i won't i won't ever you know
128:00 - if a client approaches me for a very
128:01 - good sum of money
128:02 - say that a hundred thousand dollars your
128:04 - job for c plus plus right
128:06 - well i wouldn't do it because that's not
128:08 - where i want to go right so saying no is
128:09 - quite
128:10 - quite important and learning to say you
128:11 - know and taking no for an answer is also
128:13 - very important right yeah
128:14 - sometimes it happens that you try your
128:15 - best and you you're not able to you know
128:17 - land that job it's okay like you can
128:19 - just try it again but and also sometimes
128:21 - you have to say no
128:22 - to a client that's approaching you and
128:24 - yeah it has happened with me too like
128:26 - one of one of my clients was about
128:28 - machine learning right it was happening
128:30 - really
128:31 - really recently and i told him frankly
128:32 - that you know i'm not into machine
128:34 - learning and all that kind of stuff so i
128:35 - don't mean that i'll be ideal for you
128:37 - yeah i agree that's another thing
128:40 - everybody wants machine learning
128:42 - yeah everybody wants machine learning
128:45 - you'll see
128:45 - ai it's like wait wait you want machine
128:48 - learning for what
128:49 - oh so you can change this one button and
128:51 - make it blue
128:52 - yeah you guys don't understand like how
128:57 - crazy it is out there because there's
128:58 - such a huge disconnect between the
129:00 - people that build the stuff
129:01 - and the people that are kind of on the
129:03 - business side yeah like the business
129:05 - guys are like hey
129:06 - we gotta make this thing machine
129:08 - learning we gotta do this and that's
129:09 - like
129:10 - for whatever you don't want to
129:11 - complicate it ever like you don't even
129:13 - need to overcomplicate it like machine
129:15 - learning
129:16 - all in terms of yes yes it does apply
129:17 - sometimes but you know
129:19 - it's it's not at all necessary for you
129:21 - to you know like always include machine
129:23 - learning and whatever you're doing
129:26 - i include it in everything now because i
129:27 - just like firebase
129:29 - machine exactly yeah and yeah most of
129:33 - the time
129:34 - the the the use case remember like like
129:36 - there is a disconnect with the two
129:37 - things
129:38 - and you're going to find a situation
129:40 - where somebody might say yeah we want to
129:42 - know machine learning
129:43 - to figure out how many users prefer the
129:45 - red button against the blue button
129:47 - you're like no dude that's called a b
129:48 - testing
129:49 - and and you see like and then it kind of
129:51 - comes down to that and then and then
129:53 - they'll be like oh oh
129:54 - well yeah yeah i want that and then
129:55 - you'll be like yeah i know how to do
129:56 - that
129:57 - and then they'll be like oh okay
129:58 - like that that kind of thing quickly
130:00 - builds the trust in the conversation
130:01 - like that's because firebase does it
130:03 - it's like look it up on facebook
130:04 - yeah whatever firebase supports i am an
130:08 - expert
130:08 - yeah google optimize is good yeah you
130:13 - know like uh
130:14 - suggest some technologies or something
130:15 - to the client and say that yes this
130:17 - might
130:17 - be the better way to do it you know if
130:20 - they're if they're going in the romney
130:21 - and if you show them that you care uh
130:23 - that actually
130:24 - brings up a lot about you talk it does a
130:26 - lot about you and it it
130:28 - makes an entire professional kind of
130:30 - thing right so this is again something
130:31 - that i learned from soft skills so
130:32 - if you're if you get an opportunity to
130:34 - you know improve on some technology
130:36 - or you know if you think that this
130:38 - technology might not be the correct one
130:39 - for the entire job
130:40 - then you can suggest that the client and
130:42 - sometimes the client accepts it
130:44 - sometimes they
130:44 - they don't but at least you try it right
130:46 - so it shows that you're professionally
130:48 - cared
130:49 - exactly exactly guys
130:53 - i did make a machine learning app that
130:54 - does optical recognition so i was like
130:57 - machine learning on the resume nice dude
131:00 - we're actually going to touch on a lot
131:01 - of machine learning stuff once we get
131:03 - into um
131:04 - react native builds and things like that
131:05 - so yeah like
131:07 - there's a lot of like libraries that we
131:09 - can use are going to be really
131:10 - really really handy um so we're going to
131:13 - talk about it does come with a lot of
131:14 - machine learning libraries many people
131:16 - underrate the power of javascript and
131:17 - machine learning some people are always
131:19 - like python but javascript also has
131:20 - tensorflow.js so it's quite it's quite
131:22 - powerful over there too
131:23 - yeah like tensorflow is very powerful um
131:25 - and what you can do with it is actually
131:27 - quite simple like i looked into
131:29 - tensorflow and python once
131:31 - and i i wasn't able to you know find
131:32 - some kind of like big problem in it it's
131:34 - quite simple to learn too
131:36 - yeah exactly it's quite simple to learn
131:38 - and it's going to be super
131:39 - super helpful yeah you know um you could
131:43 - build applications where
131:45 - like say you can build something in
131:47 - react native and then you can have like
131:49 - a powerful
131:50 - machine learning ai in python and just
131:53 - create endpoints and api calls
131:55 - and then connect it into your own
131:57 - application
131:58 - yeah i really would use javascript in
132:00 - that case like personally like
132:02 - javascript and python are quite similar
132:05 - if you're if you think about the syntax
132:06 - like uh deep down of course python is
132:09 - integrated in javascript it's compiled
132:11 - but
132:11 - the thing is that uh you know i don't
132:13 - really think that it's
132:14 - it's quite useful to include two
132:16 - languages when you can easily do the
132:18 - same thing with just one language so why
132:20 - include why
132:22 - like you know boost the complexity and
132:24 - why not just stick to one language
132:26 - exactly and uh to add on to what nathan
132:29 - was saying like yeah like
132:30 - a lot of the time like guys there's
132:32 - services out there that do this sort of
132:34 - like
132:34 - the heavy lifting for us and we just tap
132:36 - in right like we tap into it and we kind
132:38 - of get the benefit of machine learning
132:40 - without doing it it's like the same
132:42 - thing like it's it's just at different
132:43 - levels right like if
132:44 - again it goes back and go going back to
132:46 - date picker example
132:48 - if you have um like you wouldn't rewrite
132:51 - the library to have a date picker right
132:53 - like i wouldn't spend all that time to
132:54 - go ahead and do that i would just go
132:55 - ahead and
132:56 - it's it's crazy hard to make a date yeah
132:59 - it is i had to do one dude it's
133:02 - crazy very tough and yeah it requires a
133:05 - lot of
133:05 - uh you know knowledge how it will
133:08 - navigate
133:09 - yeah there's a lot of headache with it a
133:11 - lot of headache with her
133:12 - um guys how you can handle uh
133:14 - notification
133:16 - via email in um
133:20 - and react we will touch that we'll we'll
133:22 - touch
133:23 - base on it and in another session but
133:25 - you can use plenty of things like
133:27 - sendgrid
133:27 - uh twilio there's a lot of different
133:30 - services you can use
133:32 - expo has that feature also oh nice
133:35 - oh we could yeah i didn't know that oh
133:37 - nice yeah
133:39 - can you send a link for that oh
133:46 - like if you go to expo look at like the
133:48 - it has
133:49 - it has um like the gyroscope all the
133:53 - other functionalities i come with
133:55 - typical app development
133:56 - they're all available yeah all right all
133:59 - right let's npm run ios
134:01 - yeah let's do it all right so now
134:04 - you want to go ahead and do mpm start
134:07 - all right
134:08 - that was suspense guys it's the holy
134:12 - now mpm start and then you get this you
134:14 - get a metro bundler right so this is the
134:16 - first thing you want to kind of get
134:17 - familiar with
134:18 - and wow that's a big qr code and
134:21 - terminal um
134:22 - so what you want to do is once you get
134:24 - this thank you so much oliver says you
134:26 - are the freaking best sunny on youtube
134:28 - appreciate that dude and um what we want
134:31 - to do now
134:31 - is we have um this
134:35 - this terminal come up and this is a good
134:37 - starting point so you can hit
134:38 - i for ios simulator w for run on web i'm
134:42 - going to hit w
134:42 - to run it on the web just to quickly
134:44 - sort of test this it says attempting to
134:45 - open the project in a web browser
134:47 - so we can now go ahead and watch this
134:50 - pop up so
134:51 - it will go ahead and it it'll do a bunch
134:53 - of bundling
134:55 - browser what was that you could also
134:57 - just click
134:58 - run in web browser like yeah
135:01 - so on here you can do it here as well so
135:03 - you can take one web browser run an ios
135:05 - one on android
135:06 - or you it depends like because the
135:08 - reason why i like to show that one
135:10 - is because sometimes you have it open in
135:12 - vs code and you want to control it
135:14 - in vs code um without going back so this
135:17 - is a handy way but yeah you can
135:18 - definitely do that
135:19 - um so now what you want to do is go
135:21 - ahead and i'm just going to do command d
135:23 - to split my oh god damn i hate doing oh
135:26 - man
135:27 - what have i done how do i get rid of the
135:28 - split is it there we go
135:30 - yeah so now what i'm going to do is i'm
135:32 - going to open up
135:34 - a second tab i'm going to go into the
135:37 - same directory so i'm in here right now
135:38 - i'm going to do code insiders
135:41 - because i've got the inside this edition
135:42 - i'm going to open up vs code right
135:44 - so give it a sec and this will pop up
135:48 - okay now we're we're all familiar with
135:50 - vs code we uh if you're not then just go
135:53 - ahead and check out some of the clones
135:54 - but the first thing i want to do is go
135:56 - to extensions over here type in es
135:59 - and then i want to type in this one here
136:02 - so es7 react redux graphql react native
136:05 - snippets right so go
136:07 - make sure you download this one because
136:08 - it's really really handy it's kind of
136:10 - very very understood this one right yeah
136:14 - do you want to show them how to add the
136:17 - code thing
136:18 - to pass yeah yeah so let's show them
136:20 - that as well yeah so that's good
136:21 - so here you want to go to um so let's
136:25 - just close this for a sec
136:26 - so to get that little trick that i just
136:28 - showed you right so this one here
136:30 - so for you guys it would just be code
136:31 - spaced um and then and dot unless you do
136:34 - the code insiders
136:35 - which is like the beta sort of vs code
136:37 - um we're going to do command shift p
136:40 - and this will open this like a kind of
136:42 - selection thing right command shift p
136:44 - and then you want to type in um shell
136:47 - right
136:47 - and then you see install code command in
136:50 - path
136:51 - uh mine says code insiders if you do the
136:53 - code insiders you can get this
136:54 - and then there is a way of aliasing code
136:56 - insiders to code which i usually do
136:58 - i've just been lazy on this computer and
137:00 - i haven't done it um
137:02 - so you can pretty much go ahead and do
137:04 - that and then what that will allow you
137:06 - to do
137:06 - is when you've got a uh when you're
137:08 - inside a directory you can just do code
137:10 - insiders or code
137:12 - and then space dot which means the
137:13 - current directory and it will open up
137:15 - your entire workspace so if you notice
137:17 - if i do ls to list all the files
137:20 - if i do ls to list all the files you can
137:22 - see app.js app.json uh what was that
137:24 - sorry
137:25 - um don't forget the door time i i said
137:28 - so that yeah it's quite important
137:29 - yeah you don't want to forget that doc
137:31 - because this guy exactly it's going to
137:32 - be an important step
137:33 - and now what you want to do is you can
137:35 - have this open so i like to again
137:37 - download a few things oh my zsh is one
137:39 - thing for the sort of
137:40 - nice looking terminals which tells you
137:42 - you'll get branch and things like that
137:44 - it's really nice
137:45 - uh i always do that on a fresh computer
137:46 - then the second one i would say download
137:48 - is spectacle
137:49 - um the reason why i love spectacles so
137:50 - much and i kind of talk about it load
137:52 - this
137:52 - honestly it's just it has like i
137:54 - remember when kazi first told me about
137:55 - it i kind of overlooked it
137:57 - but when you have things like this you
137:58 - do i do command option f
138:00 - boom uh do this and i kind of and even
138:02 - if i want to do like
138:03 - a three-quarter split um i can do that
138:06 - so you see it's very quick
138:07 - to go ahead and resize my screens and
138:09 - then i can have multiple desktops for if
138:11 - i want like sometimes if i'm coding
138:14 - um i this is so in case you're curious
138:17 - as to how my flow is right
138:19 - i have a big screen above me right now
138:21 - so you don't need to have a second
138:22 - screen but i have a laptop here
138:24 - and then i have a second big monitor in
138:27 - front of me
138:27 - so i have an ultra wide and then but
138:29 - what i would say is even if you don't i
138:30 - didn't have an ultrawide when i started
138:31 - i just had a second screen
138:33 - you can pretty much go ahead and if you
138:34 - don't have a second screen so i'm going
138:36 - to start with one screen
138:37 - then what i recommend is make get really
138:39 - good at using um multiple desktops like
138:41 - this so you see i'm just literally
138:42 - swiping between them or mac
138:44 - um windows has a similar functionality
138:47 - and what i would do is
138:48 - the arrow key for windows with control
138:50 - windows
138:52 - exactly yeah so control win and then the
138:54 - arrow key and then you'll be able to go
138:55 - through them
138:56 - so what i would do is i'll typically
138:57 - have some kind of like a browser over on
138:59 - this side
139:00 - and then i'll have my code editor on
139:01 - this side little and a little sort of um
139:04 - viewpoint over on this side okay so this
139:06 - is going to be um
139:08 - a really quick way to sort of code and
139:09 - or you can kind of mix and match so i've
139:11 - had it where i've had the full code
139:12 - thing and then i would have the sort of
139:14 - app running here
139:15 - um but again it comes down to preference
139:17 - right so now we're going to click on
139:19 - app.js
139:20 - and you can see here i can see my app so
139:22 - i can see open up app.js to start
139:23 - working on your app
139:24 - so now if i go ahead and type in like
139:26 - one two three
139:27 - one two three popup react all right and
139:30 - then
139:31 - save you can see there you go hot
139:33 - reloading so we get the hot reloading
139:35 - and this is the app working and and
139:37 - everything's good so now quick few
139:38 - things to notice
139:40 - again very similar outcome right so very
139:42 - similar to our react apps we just have a
139:45 - functional component
139:46 - so if we was going to make this i'm
139:48 - going to create a new component and show
139:49 - you how just how similar it is to a
139:51 - react app right
139:52 - so let's go ahead and create a sort of
139:54 - let's call it um
139:56 - what should we call it what should we
139:57 - call like a new component should we just
139:58 - call it maybe a
139:59 - uh a profile right so a profile dot
140:03 - um um let's just call it a row
140:07 - right we have a row oh god this is the
140:10 - thing when coding you kind of get blank
140:11 - i'm going to go for profile
140:12 - profile.js right and then what i'm going
140:15 - to do is i'm going to use
140:16 - the snippets but i'm going to so
140:17 - typically what we were doing before was
140:18 - we didn't
140:19 - we're saying rfce and that was a react
140:22 - functional component exported right
140:24 - which
140:24 - which does this now this does a react
140:27 - functional component but in in the react
140:29 - js which is the web one right
140:31 - and the reason why we know it's web is
140:32 - because it says div and and so forth
140:35 - we don't want this one instead we want
140:36 - the rn for react native
140:39 - and then you do f and then you can
140:41 - actually go ahead and do i think it's
140:42 - just e
140:43 - r and f e right and then i'm not sure
140:45 - what s is s oh yeah s
140:47 - is with the style sheet yeah so with e
140:49 - by itself is the default profile and it
140:51 - will go ahead and stay up for you
140:53 - and uh e s is with a style sheet so i'll
140:56 - do it with the style sheet if i was you
140:57 - because it sets up everything that you
140:59 - kind of need
140:59 - and you see it does all the imports and
141:01 - it goes ahead and sets up your first
141:02 - little
141:03 - section here so let's make this take
141:05 - props
141:06 - and i'm going to destructure the props
141:08 - and say okay it has some some text for
141:10 - the profile
141:11 - so let's go ahead and just render that
141:12 - text here
141:14 - and what i'm going to do is know about
141:16 - this extension called
141:17 - kite i think it's available and it's
141:20 - quite powerful it's an ai extension it's
141:22 - not just for it's actually you need to
141:23 - install it and set it up
141:25 - don't do it right now but uh yeah it's
141:27 - it's very very handy like i use it all
141:29 - the time and
141:30 - trust me i find it so valuable oh yeah
141:32 - oh nice dude
141:34 - yeah like it's so it's like an entirely
141:36 - auto complete engine so
141:38 - the autocomplete of vs code isn't that
141:40 - good and once you start with kite right
141:42 - you just have to type dot and it um
141:45 - shows up
141:45 - not from the popularity but from the
141:47 - recommendation from the ai itself
141:49 - so it's very very handy and yeah
141:52 - actually
141:52 - they actually imported like millions of
141:55 - lines of code from github
141:56 - and then based it on like how many stars
141:59 - that github thing had
142:00 - and so you're basically pulling code in
142:02 - from like someone's amazing library
142:05 - oh really nice
142:10 - there is actually one more thing to it
142:11 - and that surprised me a lot
142:13 - so you you always find yourself you know
142:15 - looking up for documentation right
142:17 - guess what this comes with inbuilt
142:19 - copilot mode so you can actually have
142:21 - your documentation on the side
142:23 - and then whenever you you can just
142:25 - search for a term and it can act as a
142:26 - search engine it's quite powerful
142:28 - yeah that's dope dude so i've installed
142:31 - it now
142:31 - uh let's go ahead and use it so what's
142:34 - the simplest way you gotta install on
142:35 - your computer
142:37 - oh hi oh damn okay so there's actually
142:40 - an engine let's do it right now let's
142:41 - just go ahead and let's do it
142:42 - um let's do it so kite is downloading
142:46 - so it's got two minutes it's downloading
142:48 - so hopefully it doesn't jit up the
142:50 - screen a stream
142:51 - um but what we can do now is uh that's
142:54 - cool because i actually
142:55 - i read this in the newsletter ages ago
142:58 - um
142:59 - because i recognized this uh sort of
143:01 - logo but
143:02 - they advertise a lot in the newsletters
143:04 - yeah i saw ages going i kind of just you
143:06 - know when you read something and
143:08 - videos are sponsored by kite and like
143:10 - literally all of them are sponsored by
143:11 - kite
143:12 - yeah oh man
143:15 - i mean they have ai they have real ai
143:18 - really yeah
143:18 - yeah exactly yeah so that's going to be
143:22 - pretty good for them um so now
143:25 - github.com
143:26 - exactly and so now it's downloading it's
143:30 - got 29 seconds left okay so we should be
143:32 - able to see this in a sec
143:34 - um so i need to go ahead and just
143:36 - install that and then start okay
143:38 - cool we'll give that a go and then what
143:39 - happens is what as i'm typing it's going
143:41 - to just
143:41 - prompt me with auto completes yeah when
143:44 - you're very
143:45 - dot uh then you will find a lot of auto
143:47 - complete so if you ever need something
143:48 - like autocomplete then of course it's
143:50 - gonna be there and it's quite powerful
143:51 - again but does it break my emmett
143:54 - no i don't i don't i don't think so it
143:57 - doesn't break your emit when you're
143:58 - using html it doesn't break your limit
144:00 - but
144:01 - i use python heavily and in python you
144:04 - know
144:04 - there is a library called the os library
144:06 - you deal with a lot of operating system
144:08 - stuff
144:08 - yeah and over there like you can write
144:10 - the entire for loop it will write
144:12 - everything for you
144:13 - and the entire follow will be written to
144:15 - you just by just using a few dot
144:17 - and stuff like that it's very powerful
144:19 - nice okay let's do it so i've installed
144:21 - it i'm gonna run kite
144:23 - um so again if you guys aren't using
144:25 - alfred
144:26 - you should be using alfred as well
144:28 - because alfred is a game changer
144:30 - yeah alfred is a game changer and you
144:32 - want to make sure you enable
144:33 - so if you go to alfred um i'm going to
144:35 - go
144:37 - ahead we're talking about a lot of
144:38 - extensions over here yeah i know
144:41 - i got quite a few so here request
144:43 - permission blah blah blah okay
144:45 - yep um oh god this is anything
144:49 - requires so many okay so uh let me go
144:51 - ahead and quickly sign up to this
144:53 - and because we can if this is a tool
144:55 - that will help everyone out for sure
144:56 - dude let's go ahead and show this i'm
144:58 - going to quickly
144:58 - can you go live streams too like
145:00 - sometimes you know you have to die
145:02 - yeah with it you don't really need to do
145:04 - all that so again it's a very handy tool
145:07 - sponsor what's up exactly yeah
145:10 - sponsored by kai that sounded legit dude
145:17 - for the very very best ml
145:21 - completion very smooth code
145:24 - that's it so this is gonna okay so kite
145:26 - co-pilot is installed it's installing of
145:29 - them
145:29 - okay i'm definitely not using them right
145:31 - now um and then
145:32 - it's very very hectic i i used it once i
145:35 - regret it
145:36 - yeah i've used vim before yeah i only
145:38 - use it when i
145:39 - have to use it in a server situation
145:41 - navigation is quite
145:42 - useful with them the key wirings are
145:44 - epic yeah of course you won't find them
145:46 - anywhere else but
145:47 - vs code is just 7d so i use anything
145:49 - else nice
145:50 - okay so now i've got it installed um
145:53 - what's how's
145:54 - what's the next step now um i think that
145:58 - in your vs code you should get a symbol
146:01 - of kite uh below in the in the
146:04 - um
146:09 - okay so oh okay see uh i think it said
146:12 - you need to restart vs code as well
146:14 - somewhere so
146:15 - i think you do okay so now we've we've
146:17 - done that and then we can see
146:18 - welcome to kai hey there we go
146:21 - let's go let's check this out some
146:23 - developer has taken years to add this um
146:27 - uh this little design in so let's see
146:28 - what they've done what they've done here
146:30 - mike's
146:30 - now my spectacle's not working good now
146:33 - okay
146:34 - something is glitching up okay there we
146:36 - go okay
146:37 - uh lintel. okay so now
146:41 - so not writing python do i need to do i
146:44 - need to do that or
146:45 - do not put it open to the respondent
146:47 - javascript
146:48 - okay that's a tutorial cool code
146:50 - completions right so if you ever edit a
146:52 - configure to show
146:53 - the kite will show your computer's
146:54 - automatically as you type okay
146:56 - which we already have on and then import
146:58 - j things like that control space if all
147:00 - completions aren't on yes i already have
147:02 - all
147:03 - completions on so if we do like one oh
147:05 - sick okay
147:07 - so it's already starting to pop up and
147:10 - then if i do
147:10 - control space oh no oops you get this
147:14 - report
147:14 - types from but it would learn right as
147:16 - i'm as i uh
147:17 - yeah yeah as you as you commit stuff
147:20 - locally it looks through like your local
147:21 - kind of github right so there is one
147:24 - concern regarding kite it
147:26 - does send some of your code up into the
147:29 - cloud for
147:30 - analysis like you said no right now
147:38 - they mention it yeah so this was a thing
147:42 - i used it like
147:43 - eight or nine months ago they might have
147:45 - updated it but this was the main concern
147:47 - why kite was not used
147:49 - because on a professional level you are
147:51 - not allowed to send the code
147:53 - yeah if they have fixed it i don't think
147:55 - so there is a better solution
147:57 - yeah so now it says does not send your
147:58 - code or any byproducts
148:00 - uh to the cloud i i read the entire
148:03 - thing that's why i even talked
148:04 - about it and i wouldn't have talked
148:05 - about it because i was reading through
148:07 - it and i found it very useful
148:08 - personally nice dude yeah i mean let's
148:11 - give it a go now so i guess like we'll
148:12 - just see it pop up more
148:14 - um as it comes up and then i guess if
148:16 - you do and you can actually you see the
148:18 - coupe and the co-op
148:19 - is quite useful okay so co-pilot
148:22 - is here so this thing
148:28 - and now whenever you're stuck anywhere
148:29 - you can just search for the term and
148:31 - yeah it will just bring you
148:32 - bring it to you it's amazing which means
148:35 - if i do like import
148:38 - right yeah i mean i mean i think the
148:40 - auto completion will be the main sort of
148:42 - um
148:42 - benefit yeah of course you're gonna use
148:44 - auto completion here
148:46 - yeah and it's gonna make life so much
148:48 - easier at least it made it easier for me
148:50 - because i use a lot of python yeah and
148:53 - um
148:55 - it picked up the bam convention stuff
148:57 - for me oh really
148:59 - yeah it was like i was like i didn't add
149:01 - that so there's not really auto
149:03 - completion for bam stuff so oh
149:05 - i love that dude yeah yeah okay
149:09 - like if there's like linting on your ben
149:11 - stuff like it's it
149:12 - it kind of learns stuff it's pretty cool
149:15 - nice okay
149:17 - so if say if we go ahead and install
149:19 - profile um
149:20 - import profile sorry so import profile
149:23 - from profile and then let's go ahead and
149:24 - add text and then say like a profile is
149:27 - where the text will say like hello world
149:30 - oh well let's just say ssssanga profile
149:33 - okay now we should see this pop up okay
149:35 - so we have one profile
149:37 - two profile three profile and then let's
149:40 - just say we have clever karsi
149:43 - let's just say test one two three okay
149:46 - save and now you can see like okay so
149:48 - we've got this is literally react uh
149:50 - react native still guys like as in
149:51 - just to show you it really doesn't
149:54 - change like
149:55 - so we're actually coding in in react
149:57 - here so it's just very simple same thing
149:59 - principles the same uh notice how the
150:01 - styling is a little bit different so you
150:02 - have this style stop container
150:04 - and then you apply these kind of styles
150:06 - right so it's no longer the typical sort
150:08 - of css
150:09 - styles are getting applied instead what
150:11 - we can do is you can have it like this
150:12 - so imagine like the styles for this
150:14 - container
150:15 - right now the background color is white
150:17 - right so what i'm going to do is i'm
150:18 - going to change the background color to
150:20 - let's just go ahead and say like
150:21 - red for example and then you should see
150:24 - everything goes red in the background
150:25 - right
150:25 - and then if you want to change the color
150:27 - of the text i can go ahead and say color
150:28 - and i can say white
150:30 - and then i can do boom and
150:33 - that oh oops um this is the container so
150:38 - um color text swipe
150:41 - what we might have to do here is say
150:44 - instead i might have to actually give
150:45 - this a style and say
150:46 - let's go ahead and say styles dot uh
150:49 - just this is a very generic say text and
150:52 - here i can say
150:54 - text like i say color
150:58 - oh damn look at that dude
151:02 - oh nice okay this is going to make me
151:04 - jack man
151:05 - okay good times yeah
151:08 - you're probably the best the best from
151:10 - kid oh my god dude let you guys watch me
151:13 - build
151:13 - clones off the clones and you didn't
151:15 - want one
151:16 - nobody mentioned the kind of twitter
151:20 - i know right i need to upload like all
151:22 - of those clones to kai and it will pick
151:24 - up my kind of
151:25 - staho now priyanji i really thank you
151:28 - for for shouting that one because um
151:30 - that's that would be pretty cool i think
151:31 - it would definitely like even there the
151:33 - use case there was very
151:34 - like pretty quick yeah i just found a
151:36 - lot of value from it and i just wanted
151:37 - to share it with you guys and if you
151:39 - if you also use it in the live stream
151:40 - that would be very happy because
151:42 - personally it brought a lot of value to
151:43 - me as a python developer at least
151:45 - and um yeah i think that it supports
151:47 - like 16 to 18 languages
151:49 - right and uh so if you're in c sharp c
151:51 - plus plus all of that kind of stuff
151:53 - even in java i think sunny has already
151:54 - programmed in java so
151:56 - uh yeah it it does support all that you
151:58 - think about it you're typing in print
152:00 - hello world in javascript and no longer
152:01 - you have to type in the entire thing
152:03 - yeah and that will be so phenomenal
152:06 - that's cool that's cool like there's
152:09 - there's a few snippets i
152:10 - i've kind of come to i never write
152:12 - console.log every like i i always let
152:14 - you clg
152:15 - like that's just the kind of like small
152:17 - little tricks and stuff like that but i
152:19 - know in
152:20 - in this case now you're gonna have this
152:21 - kind of jacked console logo i guess
152:23 - like with which is going to come like
152:25 - all complete
152:26 - i mean it's cool man i think anything
152:28 - that can speed up your workflow
152:30 - i know a lot of people are a fan of the
152:31 - brackets uh bro i think it's what is it
152:33 - called color bracket
152:34 - bracketizer or something i personally
152:36 - don't like it i just like to do this
152:38 - i think it's a bit too much on the
152:39 - screen um but
152:41 - again like it's all down to preference
152:43 - but kite seems like it's
152:44 - it would be cool so that would be pretty
152:47 - we'll see how that goes
152:48 - um but yeah so we have this right here
152:51 - right now i'm going to quickly go ahead
152:52 - and add on something like react
152:54 - navigation to this
152:55 - and i can show you guys all right uh
152:57 - sunny i have a quick question for you
152:58 - yeah
152:59 - uh maybe a friend can answer um this
153:01 - style part
153:02 - okay uh the css art yep do we have to
153:05 - have the same file for the react native
153:07 - or
153:08 - are good can we do the same way as we
153:10 - were doing for the react
153:12 - yeah good question so what what we tend
153:14 - to do with this so you don't want to
153:15 - actually have it always in the same you
153:17 - can have it in the same there's nothing
153:18 - wrong with that
153:19 - um and it would sort of reduce the
153:20 - complexity if it's a small component you
153:22 - could have it in the same
153:23 - but a lot of people do have a convention
153:25 - for this and it's like app.style.js or
153:28 - app.styles
153:29 - is it styles no is it um there's a
153:31 - convention for this it's um
153:34 - i'm sure it's app.styles.js
153:36 - app.styles.js
153:38 - unless there's a different one let me
153:39 - quickly just double check app.styles.js
153:45 - there is a there is a convention for it
153:47 - that i've typically followed um
153:50 - styles dot app no it's not style style
153:52 - does anyone know
153:53 - um they're sort of i've used it before
153:55 - but in this case
153:56 - but say we had this right app.style.js
153:59 - or something
154:00 - what we could do is we can go ahead and
154:01 - do this and
154:03 - paste it here oops paste it here and now
154:05 - what i could do is i could just go ahead
154:06 - and and you can either you can do it a
154:08 - few ways right you can even do export
154:09 - default
154:10 - right here export default um styles
154:13 - like this and that can be very clean and
154:15 - simple and then you can go ahead and say
154:17 - import styles from
154:20 - import styles from
154:23 - [Music]
154:28 - app.styles.js then you can go ahead and
154:30 - get rid of this and now you've got the
154:32 - same sort of structure
154:33 - that we were used to before and you can
154:35 - see here it's freaking out so
154:38 - stylesheet.create is not a function oh
154:40 - yeah because we need the it should be
154:41 - stylesheet
154:42 - yeah with css um did i do
154:47 - no that's good good so
154:50 - here we go to we need we just need to
154:52 - import stylesheet from react native oh
154:54 - yeah and then we should come back and
154:58 - it says stars is not defined okay so
155:00 - let's go ahead and check out why so that
155:01 - is in app.js9
155:03 - um styles oh yeah because we've got cap
155:06 - os so we're going to do lowercase s
155:08 - uh to be honest i mean it's all down to
155:10 - your standards
155:11 - but we it says we keep it located just
155:13 - for a demo you can see that works
155:15 - right so in that case now we've got the
155:17 - same similar
155:19 - layout with some kind of styles file and
155:21 - a simple import so you can do this
155:23 - as well right um what is the best
155:26 - practices for using a style sheet here
155:29 - uh in a module itself in a component or
155:32 - outside
155:33 - um so it depends really um remember like
155:37 - this is a very simple app if you add a
155:41 - folder structure
155:42 - so i've seen loads of different photo
155:44 - structures i've had components
155:45 - very simple that ones where you have a
155:46 - folder with just components and you have
155:48 - another photo with pages
155:50 - and you can split your app up into that
155:51 - i've also seen in tesco they had
155:53 - molecules and
155:54 - atoms um so molecules are like atoms are
155:58 - the absolute smallest components
156:00 - so imagine you had a component called
156:02 - like a profile picture
156:05 - yeah imagine like you had profile
156:07 - picture.js right and then
156:09 - a molecule could have been the
156:11 - profile.js which was the entire profile
156:14 - which consisted of multiple atoms
156:17 - you see and then you see why it kind of
156:19 - makes sense when you call atoms versus
156:21 - molecule
156:22 - um and then like to you so there's loads
156:24 - of different like standards that people
156:26 - use
156:27 - the main thing i would say is kind of
156:28 - have it as as a very standard base
156:31 - have a component a components folder
156:34 - have a pages folder now pages is for
156:37 - going to be a navigation different pages
156:38 - in your app
156:39 - have a components for the for the
156:40 - reusable components inside of your app
156:43 - right so you can have like the login
156:45 - page inside of the pages com
156:46 - inside the pages folder and so forth i'm
156:48 - not going to do that today because it's
156:50 - going to get a bit nested but the point
156:51 - is is
156:52 - anything which keeps it very like neat
156:54 - and to be honest what i would recommend
156:56 - is
156:56 - like frank said before go ahead and
156:58 - check out other people's code see how
156:59 - they've done it
157:00 - see if you can notice remember pattern
157:01 - recognition if you start seeing a few
157:03 - patterns remember this stuff evolves
157:05 - it's never just like this one
157:07 - size fits all uh and it's also very
157:10 - opinionated um it can change like uh
157:13 - app.styles.js might be the way now but
157:15 - it could completely change and there
157:17 - could be a much better way of doing it
157:18 - tomorrow
157:19 - and i think like for example if i have a
157:21 - team
157:22 - of 10 people right now i'm gonna go to
157:24 - sleep then which approach will be good
157:26 - quite late over here
157:27 - yeah sonny i gotta i gotta head to a
157:29 - meeting but anybody can hit me up
157:31 - anytime on slack and i i got a couple
157:34 - messages and
157:35 - happy to help anybody in the community
157:37 - so amazing
157:38 - thank you frank and thank you both of
157:40 - you guys were awesome in this call and
157:42 - and again everyone connected yeah
157:49 - right um okay let me quickly pull up my
157:52 - chat as well because i can't really see
157:54 - my chat as well now okay so
157:57 - [Music]
157:58 - there we go so
158:01 - okay so what we're going to do now is
158:03 - we've pretty much talked about that
158:04 - we've got the
158:05 - our first sort of react native app up
158:07 - and running right so we saw the
158:08 - differences between
158:09 - um like you see still functional
158:11 - component if i wanted to stay in this
158:13 - app i would pretty much go ahead and do
158:15 - this i would say const
158:16 - or i would actually just use my snippet
158:18 - so i'll say use state
158:19 - and boom i'll get this and it'll kind of
158:21 - give me the template for it
158:22 - and i'll say the name of the state so
158:24 - let's imagine if i had like a name
158:26 - piece of state and then this set name is
158:28 - the convention
158:29 - and then use state and i'd say the the
158:31 - name here would be like for example just
158:32 - to say sunny was my the default name
158:35 - right and then if i had the text for the
158:37 - first one was that piece of state so
158:39 - imagine we had name
158:40 - okay now uh
158:44 - imagine we sort of have this um okay so
158:47 - it's freaking out because use state
158:48 - isn't imported
158:49 - so we need to go ahead and import that
158:51 - from react so you see them
158:53 - the kind of hooks and things like that
158:54 - are the exact same nothing changes right
158:57 - everything works in the exact same
158:59 - fashion in the exact same way
159:01 - now what we want to do next is we have
159:06 - um if i if i had an input field right so
159:09 - i'm going to give you guys a quick
159:10 - example of the differences so in this
159:12 - case you would have
159:13 - um text input right it's a text input
159:17 - and text input has a value called text
159:20 - so it has a value called text
159:22 - and yeah so text is i think it's text
159:24 - actually um i think it's maybe
159:26 - value or is it text value yeah says
159:29 - value i think
159:30 - value and then value would be name right
159:32 - so if i go ahead and and do this now you
159:34 - can see like i said by default it says
159:36 - there's a text input field and
159:37 - the value is set to name right in this
159:40 - case
159:40 - what we'll do is we'll set this to blank
159:42 - right and i'm going to make this the
159:44 - name but i need there's also a change
159:46 - event right so just like we had input
159:47 - fields
159:48 - they get changed and updated in react
159:50 - react native we have a change event so i
159:52 - think it's on change
159:54 - and um this so typically we had e
159:57 - and remember e.target.value is how we
160:00 - got the text from the input field
160:01 - and in uh in rec native it's very simple
160:05 - they just give you the text straight
160:06 - away
160:06 - and then you can pretty much go ahead
160:07 - and say set name to that text
160:09 - so it's a little bit simpler and react
160:11 - native when the way they do that and i
160:12 - think
160:13 - this will be enough to work so if i type
160:16 - in a
160:16 - oh okay so it's not on change i think
160:19 - it's on change text
160:21 - on change text that one so now
160:24 - if i go back and we go it should be
160:26 - underneath here
160:27 - there we go and if i go ahead and zoom
160:29 - in i'm going to say
160:30 - abc okay perfect so you see now i'm
160:33 - updating the state
160:34 - so you can see like i've got the text
160:36 - input field so i'm going to go ahead and
160:37 - hide that so you've got text input
160:39 - the value is the name piece of state and
160:41 - then we've got on change of text so
160:43 - unchange text
160:44 - and it just shoots off text every time i
160:46 - sort of type something in so abc123
160:50 - and then you can see that updates this
160:51 - piece of state and then what we have
160:54 - is the profile component that we wrote
160:56 - before is taking
160:57 - that piece of state so that name piece
160:59 - of state is passing in as a prop
161:02 - for here inside the profile component
161:04 - and then we just rendered that out
161:05 - underneath
161:05 - right so here if i was gonna just
161:08 - dramatize i could say
161:09 - profile is boom this guy
161:13 - and now you can see if i do this it says
161:15 - profile is sunny
161:17 - yeah so that makes a lot more a little
161:19 - bit more sense and what i would say is
161:20 - to make it
161:21 - super visual what we can see is now
161:23 - you've got the app at the top
161:25 - and then you've got this profile section
161:26 - and this is honestly like it depends
161:28 - right so
161:29 - again figure out the workflow that works
161:31 - for you
161:33 - in what you're doing at that point in
161:34 - time so i always find myself kind of
161:36 - like
161:37 - uh switching between things so imagine
161:39 - if i if i'm working on my styling of my
161:40 - app right now right
161:41 - so i can't sometimes have the app.styles
161:44 - underneath
161:45 - and i'll be like okay this makes sense
161:46 - because now i can kind of start my app i
161:48 - can see it getting updated
161:49 - and it's super quick right so if i want
161:51 - to change the background to green
161:52 - i can go ahead and do that and i can be
161:54 - like oh yeah actually i want to have two
161:55 - profiles
161:56 - i want the name to pop up twice and now
161:58 - i can say sunny okay cool
162:00 - and i can go here and i can change this
162:01 - to blue action i really like that and
162:03 - then you see it just makes sense like i
162:04 - can kind of do all this stuff
162:06 - very quick i don't have to kind of mess
162:08 - around between different screens and
162:10 - different windows
162:11 - and then and and a very handy shortcut
162:14 - is command p
162:15 - so command p is like this very quick way
162:18 - to run through your app so i never
162:19 - you'll never
162:20 - typically see me opening the file tree
162:22 - and kind of running through it like this
162:24 - and that's like i'm really searching for
162:26 - something but what i tend to do is
162:27 - command p
162:28 - and i'll type in profile and just enter
162:30 - and it opens the file for me
162:31 - right and if i do command pp it goes
162:34 - back to the previous file i was in
162:36 - so these are very quick tricks that make
162:39 - you a lot quicker
162:40 - as a developer right so command pp and
162:42 - you pretty much go back and forth
162:43 - between the previous files so now
162:45 - if you're if you're coding in this one
162:47 - um you can go back
162:48 - to command pp and if you want to go two
162:50 - files back
162:51 - you just do ppe and you kind of cycle
162:53 - through it you see that so you kind of
162:54 - just run through it
162:56 - right so that's going to be very very
162:58 - handy in sort of like uh
162:59 - and speeding up your your development
163:01 - time and getting quicker with that sort
163:03 - of stuff
163:04 - so that's going to be awesome
163:07 - what i would say is as well guys is in a
163:09 - previous video i talked about
163:10 - um implementing so i would recommend at
163:12 - this point everyone going ahead and
163:15 - building out
163:16 - a react native app up to this point and
163:19 - also
163:20 - go into that terminal and type in like i
163:23 - so you see it says opening in ios
163:25 - right opening the ios simulator and what
163:27 - this does is i mean hopefully it doesn't
163:29 - kill the computer
163:29 - when i'm live but um what this will do
163:32 - is it will pull up ios simulator
163:34 - and it will just go ahead and boot up an
163:36 - iphone so you would have to probably
163:38 - most likely install your your xcode and
163:40 - things like that for
163:41 - for the ios simulator um otherwise
163:44 - android again you need to do that for
163:45 - android i'm not sure
163:47 - actually if you need to have xcode for
163:49 - this i think you might
163:50 - be able to do it without it but with
163:52 - that said you might be able to go ahead
163:54 - and um
163:56 - and make it work otherwise but yeah so
163:58 - the simulators are typically slower
164:00 - but once they sort of work it it should
164:02 - speed up pretty quick
164:03 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna close that for
164:05 - now and the point is is that
164:06 - again i would kind of go quite far with
164:09 - doing it on the
164:10 - web because you can see webs super quick
164:12 - you're gonna get a really nice
164:13 - experience
164:14 - um and then it's gonna be pretty close
164:16 - to the app and then i would kind of go
164:18 - ahead and test it on the app once i get
164:20 - so far
164:20 - so i'd kind of use this kind of view or
164:22 - this kind of setup to build up react
164:24 - navigation
164:25 - uh to set up redux on the sort of store
164:27 - and everything like that
164:28 - to get everything on that sort of things
164:31 - up and and um
164:32 - then i would go on to uh the sort of
164:34 - simulator because it works out a bit
164:35 - quicker
164:36 - doing it that way right so it'll be a
164:38 - bit quicker doing it in that fashion
164:40 - um so any one question for this
164:43 - if i have to build an application like a
164:45 - amazon clone
164:46 - so i have to use a firebase and
164:50 - redux to manage the state right so the
164:52 - same way we did it in
164:53 - react um so it products
164:57 - firebase authentication and then so
164:59 - remember just kind of
165:00 - kind of break it down into features
165:02 - right so if you need login then well
165:04 - firebase authentication will help you do
165:06 - that
165:06 - now if you need um if you need a
165:08 - database and you need sort of tracking
165:10 - of orders and you need to have like
165:11 - carts and things like that
165:13 - then firebase storage is going to be the
165:16 - uh the way to go with
165:18 - yeah so firebase firestore that would be
165:20 - really good for you
165:21 - um and what about mongodb so again
165:25 - mongodb
165:25 - now remember firestore is a nosql
165:28 - database which is the same structure as
165:30 - mongodb
165:30 - but you get the real-time benefits using
165:33 - firestore
165:34 - mongodb i would say to learn about
165:36 - mongodb go ahead and check out
165:38 - the make sure you go ahead and check out
165:41 - the
165:42 - man stack builds because the man stack
165:43 - builds we cover a lot of all that stuff
165:45 - mongodbe
165:46 - um so what i would say is do the clones
165:48 - right so
165:49 - i just want to ask like so everyone here
165:52 - right now
165:53 - how many of you just raise your hand
165:55 - with people who've got cameras on or
165:56 - type it down
165:57 - how many of you have done a a certain
165:59 - degree of clones
166:02 - so i'm raising my hand i've done that
166:03 - pretty much right there
166:05 - yeah so you've done them right yeah one
166:08 - column
166:08 - okay so one clone uh at two you how many
166:10 - were you saying one
166:12 - or one okay so i can see a few people
166:14 - have one up so pedro's got three up
166:16 - um anisha's got two up um okay
166:19 - so now patrice has got a seven up
166:23 - okay awesome nice patrice nice dude
166:26 - that's awesome man yeah um what i was
166:29 - gonna say is i see loads of twos threes
166:31 - right
166:31 - and things like that level up guys and i
166:34 - see i tell her it was like i got five
166:35 - i got five on my belt okay um so you
166:39 - want to make sure you
166:40 - like like do more builds right so i can
166:43 - see in the in the chat as well we've got
166:44 - uh sahana two brian four antonio six
166:48 - okay cool i highly five more than five
166:50 - nice right so what i was saying d
166:52 - has got half damn it go on you know like
166:55 - yeah will it be good that if i uh
166:58 - create a design so we can collaborately
167:01 - work together
167:02 - all of us you know one component for
167:04 - this person one component so they can
167:06 - learn it also
167:07 - so i build a crm application full
167:10 - from scratch to the production so i
167:12 - would say honestly in my opinion
167:14 - for you all to benefit the most right
167:17 - what i would say is for the clones
167:19 - right so to try and do as many clones as
167:21 - you possibly can there are literally
167:22 - about
167:23 - um oh nice jessie's i joined nine days
167:25 - ago what's up clone finish awesome
167:27 - nice um what i would say is guys there
167:30 - are literally 20 to 25 clones
167:33 - right um so so and i know that someone
167:36 - e5 will be exact
167:37 - 25 to be exact damn man literally
167:42 - the guy will start doing that too yeah
167:44 - there's
167:45 - literally there's 25 clones right so i
167:48 - mean
167:48 - i don't even remember building 25 clones
167:50 - [Laughter]
167:53 - but the point is that like so many i i
167:56 - built so many in my
167:57 - previous company so many things new
167:59 - stuff yeah
168:01 - you're gonna build out a bunch of stuff
168:02 - but what i would recommend now to
168:04 - progress for you guys is
168:06 - build out the uh build out the clones
168:08 - and and
168:09 - and you might be thinking yeah but i've
168:11 - done like a few clones i think that's
168:13 - enough
168:13 - the but the benefit is guys each one
168:15 - posed a different
168:16 - like sort of challenge in different
168:18 - areas for example the google clone
168:20 - presented a different challenge and we
168:22 - had to set up a google api and use it
168:24 - in a very different way um the hulu
168:27 - clone had some ui design elements that
168:29 - were challenging
168:30 - the amazon clone the five day challenge
168:32 - one
168:33 - hundred percent if you guys haven't
168:35 - built that do the amazon five day
168:37 - challenge that is a full build
168:39 - full stack it's gonna have front end
168:40 - back end it's gonna have loads of
168:42 - uh everything is covered in that build
168:44 - and strike payment processing
168:46 - so it's a really good yeah very very
168:49 - powerful powerful system uh way to do it
168:51 - now the way i would say is when you saw
168:54 - how deep is working on google cloud now
168:56 - awesome
168:57 - um so i would say make sure you go ahead
169:00 - and i
169:00 - just registered messages as well that's
169:02 - that's awesome stuff um and yeah like
169:05 - all of like a flexbox is going to come
169:06 - leveling up all those things
169:08 - it's all going to be pretty much a case
169:10 - of and so she says thanks so much for
169:12 - because the rule of 0.65 and 0.35 with
169:14 - the sidebar and chat or whatsapp clown
169:16 - yeah so most people don't actually know
169:18 - how to use the flex rules properly is in
169:20 - like
169:20 - you might have used flex and sort of
169:22 - like flex wrap is the furthest you went
169:24 - right but when you actually figure out
169:26 - that flex can do
169:27 - sort of screen separation in terms of
169:29 - like 30 of the screen is this 65
169:32 - screen or the 60 70 of screens is this
169:35 - and then you kind of containerize things
169:36 - and start thinking in a containerized
169:38 - approach
169:39 - design becomes quite easy actually and
169:41 - you start to kind of like break down and
169:43 - and then what i would say is go to
169:44 - websites like dribble so that's
169:46 - i'm gonna just drop it in the chat right
169:48 - now so it's uh dribb or
169:51 - with two or three e's dribble.com
169:54 - right this is a game changer of a design
169:56 - sort of thing so if i'm going to build
169:58 - an app now i go to dribble i just
169:59 - literally type in the kind of app i'm
170:01 - building
170:02 - and there's like remember ui is a skill
170:04 - in itself right
170:05 - building clever ui systems and things
170:08 - like that and ux systems
170:09 - it's it's like we spend a lot of time to
170:12 - become good developers
170:13 - same with ui and ux right they spend a
170:15 - very long time
170:16 - there's a lot of things which make
170:18 - design good now
170:19 - you take inspiration from those kind of
170:21 - places like dribble.com
170:23 - and then kind of like strip down the
170:25 - sort of things that you see like the
170:27 - patterns you're seeing
170:28 - and again you see it's just pattern
170:29 - recognition everything comes down to
170:31 - like recognizing patterns and what sort
170:33 - of trending what are people into right
170:35 - now
170:36 - flat design is quite in fashion right
170:38 - now um
170:39 - and you see that combine that with the
170:41 - clones and you're literally combining
170:43 - that on the clothes and i would be
170:44 - shocked if you
170:45 - if everyone in this car hasn't landed a
170:47 - job in in the next
170:49 - um three to six months like as in it's
170:51 - literally that simple like don't over
170:53 - complicate it like
170:54 - build the clones um uh look on dribbles
170:58 - start putting in your
170:58 - so clones are one thing but also always
171:01 - have a side project of your own
171:02 - if you don't have a side project of your
171:04 - own you're definitely losing out there
171:05 - because
171:06 - that's where you basically take the
171:07 - knowledge and you're not listening to
171:09 - like oh sunny said
171:10 - do this so that's what i'm going to do
171:11 - to make my app work
171:13 - instead now you're like right no i've
171:15 - got a whole different use case which
171:16 - nobody else has done because this is my
171:18 - app um if you're if you were into
171:21 - hair styling and things like that right
171:22 - like you can make a barber app or
171:24 - something like that right like yeah
171:25 - and sort of like everything is around
171:27 - the booking system for barber shops or
171:28 - something like that i mean you could go
171:29 - into that kind of detail
171:31 - if you like patch was a student um he is
171:33 - a student sorry
171:34 - and he was about he was a bartender
171:36 - before so what he did is
171:38 - he actually went ahead and built a
171:39 - bartendering app right
171:41 - so i worked closely here coach patch 101
171:43 - and he basically went ahead and built
171:44 - bartendering out
171:45 - and that was awesome because then he ran
171:47 - into problems which
171:48 - only he was running into that weren't
171:50 - available in a clone
171:51 - and he had to use the skills that he
171:53 - picked up in the clones to overcome that
171:55 - and that's essentially exactly what
171:56 - happens in a job right you're going to
171:58 - use the skills that you've picked up on
172:00 - all these other things and then you're
172:01 - going to apply it
172:02 - um so that's why i would say make sure
172:04 - you're doing that apply the code the
172:06 - rule of three so the
172:07 - the rule of thirds so you're always
172:09 - spending a third of your time in and or
172:11 - everyone here right now well done
172:12 - because you've literally satisfied a
172:14 - third of that time
172:15 - requirement because you've been in a
172:16 - position where you've learned from
172:18 - somebody
172:18 - who is more experienced more sort of
172:20 - like has got more like kind of skill
172:22 - in that domain so you can pretty much
172:24 - pick up a lot of tricks and tips and
172:25 - sort of
172:26 - shortcut right so for example like i
172:28 - bought a fancy camera right now i'm not
172:30 - gonna go through and pretty much
172:32 - spend ages on google right i'm gonna
172:34 - find someone who is an absolute badass
172:36 - in videography
172:37 - and i'm gonna literally just be like i'm
172:39 - gonna just show me everything
172:41 - and and do it that way so the guy i
172:43 - bought the camera from
172:44 - i pretty much made friends with him and
172:46 - now i'm shooting tips back and forth
172:48 - with him
172:48 - and he's got a lot of videography jobs
172:50 - and i'm pretty much just going to tally
172:51 - along with him and just kind of film
172:52 - with him
172:53 - and that's how i'm going to become
172:54 - really quick really quick really fast
172:56 - because literally like somebody has
172:58 - spent years and years and years
172:59 - acquiring that skill
173:00 - and you can just come along and this is
173:02 - this is the fun fact you can come along
173:04 - and kind of pick up all the gems
173:06 - um very quickly right because it's like
173:08 - reading a book when you read a book
173:10 - the chances are there's only like a few
173:12 - key takeaways from the book but the book
173:13 - itself takes ages to read like or
173:16 - for i don't know for you it takes me
173:17 - ages to read a book sometimes honestly
173:19 - like
173:19 - and even with audible even on times two
173:22 - i'm just like i'm constantly going back
173:23 - because i phase out
173:24 - um so i mean but the thing is you're
173:27 - going to get a key takeaway now if
173:28 - somebody
173:29 - had read 50 books and came to you and
173:31 - said this is what i learned from 50
173:32 - books
173:33 - you've not only saved a bunch of time
173:35 - now of course reading the 50 books
173:37 - yourself is going to be super more
173:38 - valuable than actually
173:39 - just taking someone's word but the point
173:41 - is that when it comes to skill
173:43 - you can literally kind of shortcut that
173:46 - that sort of that that succession right
173:47 - and you can kind of like
173:49 - take that shortcut and you can just like
173:51 - crazily
173:52 - jump past senior even senior developers
173:54 - you can just kind of like overtake them
173:56 - right now like it's crazy because i have
173:57 - i've literally still had i'm in contact
173:59 - with a lot of senior developers
174:01 - that i was working with in when i was a
174:05 - junior developer
174:06 - and they're like hey dude like where are
174:07 - you at right now and this and that
174:09 - and if they saw what we were doing on
174:11 - youtube and stuff like that like holy
174:12 -  like oh my god like you're doing
174:14 - this this this
174:15 - and it's because like you you don't have
174:17 - to just because it took
174:18 - a typical like senior developers a
174:20 - couple years to get to that point
174:22 - you could be at that point in the year
174:24 - there is nothing stopping you but the
174:26 - only thing is
174:27 - is that there are some things for
174:28 - example debugging experience
174:30 - that stuff does take time which which
174:33 - you
174:34 - can't skip past and remember there's a
174:35 - balance that you can't
174:37 - expect to be really good at something
174:40 - and not
174:41 - be willing to put the time in and just
174:42 - always looking for that shortcut because
174:45 - it doesn't work that way and remember
174:47 - like i think i can't remember which
174:49 - quote
174:49 - is a quote it is but it's somebody said
174:51 - it takes ten thousand hours to can even
174:53 - consider
174:54 - yourself as an expert of something right
174:57 - so if you if you've done like
174:59 - a hundred hours and something you'd be
175:00 - like yeah i've really put in the work
175:01 - and stuff like that is it's 100 hours 10
175:03 - 000 hours
175:04 - nope so carrie i'm working right and now
175:06 - suddenly those eight hours that you were
175:08 - you put in
175:09 - you like i was debugging for eight hours
175:10 - oh my god like uh
175:12 - i'm just you know like i should be a
175:14 - full-blown developer now is that 10
175:15 - 10 000 hours nope so keep on working
175:18 - right like you see keeps
175:19 - literally put set your ceiling so high
175:21 - that you just have to keep working to
175:23 - kind of reach your own sort of like
175:24 - limitation
175:25 - otherwise the the sort of person in your
175:27 - room your colleague this and that
175:28 - if you're not surrounded by the right
175:30 - people who are pushing you it's very
175:32 - easy to kind of limit your growth
175:33 - right you kind of want somebody you want
175:35 - to be in a room full of people who are
175:36 - just like absolutely push yourself to
175:38 - your limit
175:39 - and uh and that's going to be your best
175:40 - way to push as a developer
175:42 - um and another thing which we are seeing
175:44 - in in us the trend has been changed
175:47 - like an interview they gave us you know
175:50 - uh
175:51 - 20 to 30 questions and asked us to
175:53 - complete in 13 minutes
175:55 - right before you go to the next step but
175:58 - this has a questions which you have to
176:01 - do it in a paper or somewhere
176:03 - so i i would say honestly from from the
176:06 - the experiences
176:07 - from from firstly where are you getting
176:09 - these interviews from i'm very curious
176:11 - because
176:13 - they're they're very yeah because i
176:16 - definitely
176:16 - mean yeah these are
176:20 - nuts i can say i bought so long in
176:22 - industry
176:23 - but i never did this kind of uh i never
176:25 - faced this kind of interviews
176:27 - yeah if somebody put a a a piece of
176:29 - paper in front of me and said 30
176:31 - questions you have
176:31 - you have 30 minutes i would literally be
176:33 - like oh i don't want this job anymore
176:35 - like
176:35 - you can take the pen and paper and you
176:37 - can give it someone else
176:38 - okay i'm literally i'm not working in a
176:40 - company like this right like
176:42 - you and i i just got a un interview uh
176:45 - not interview it is a screening text
176:48 - written a test
176:49 - thought they said one hour no 45 minutes
176:53 - uh
176:54 - and i believe it is a 30 questions in it
176:58 - right so what i would say is honestly at
177:00 - this point don't focus on those
177:02 - too much because the reality is is if
177:05 - you
177:05 - if you're hearing like me frank um
177:09 - anyone else who's landing clients or
177:10 - anything like that um who are telling
177:12 - you otherwise
177:13 - that the majority because even in my
177:15 - experience
177:16 - i've yet to come across that extreme of
177:19 - like
177:20 - of even like a react versus angular i
177:21 - have had companies come to me with
177:23 - migration requirements we have an
177:25 - angular app or we bought an angular app
177:27 - and we want to migrate it to react
177:28 - are you interested and i said no and
177:30 - this is again it comes down to what
177:32 - priyanshu said
177:33 - be comfortable with saying no and
177:35 - declining jobs so like
177:37 - the fact that he knows that at 13 years
177:38 - old and he's getting primed with that is
177:40 - really something that we should we
177:41 - should all look up to because
177:43 - you being comfortable with saying no
177:45 - might sound easy
177:47 - but you really do have to build that
177:48 - skill to be able to do that because
177:50 - um you could be in a room where
177:52 - somebody's willing to offer you 70 grand
177:54 - 80 grand for a job
177:55 - but it's going to it's going to have
177:57 - like a negative impact on your growth
177:59 - or your future success right but you
178:01 - might not see that because
178:03 - you're kind of blinded by the the 80
178:05 - grand right and we call this like uh
178:07 - we call this a golden golden handcuffs
178:10 - right
178:11 - and the reason why they call golden
178:12 - handcuffs is because like it's like you
178:14 - think you're in the golden situation
178:16 - right like you're getting paid money
178:17 - like everything's good
178:19 - but they've literally got you and
178:20 - they're kind of like they're kind of
178:22 - like they're limiting you because they
178:24 - they kind of like they've used the
178:25 - salary to pretty much go ahead and like
178:27 - cuff you up and sort of limit your
178:29 - growth right
178:29 - and a lot of companies will do that
178:31 - which is why i would even say
178:33 - i'm quite extreme when it comes to
178:35 - salaries and and some of the students
178:36 - who
178:37 - might know this like i push like i
178:40 - wouldn't push for like a
178:41 - a a two grand raise or a three grand
178:43 - raise i'll push for like a ten grand
178:45 - raise or like oh oh like 10 to 20 gram
178:48 - raisin
178:48 - and and that might sound like wow like
178:50 - how what the hell is he talking about
178:53 - right
178:53 - but there's ways to situate yourself for
178:56 - example
178:57 - if any of you know what devops is devops
178:59 - is a very highly paid
179:01 - sector inside of software development
179:02 - right devops
179:04 - if you're a full stack developer and you
179:06 - you're you pick up devops skills on the
179:08 - side and you build up your own projects
179:10 - you get very comfortable with ci
179:12 - and all this other stuff and then you
179:13 - kind of get you move into a company
179:15 - let's say you move into a company at 50k
179:17 - right so they're paying you 50k as a
179:19 - base salary unless they
179:21 - they're devops guy they're paying um 80k
179:24 - right because devops get paid very well
179:25 - right
179:26 - now imagine the devops guy what i would
179:28 - do is i would move into that company
179:30 - i would shadow the devops guy which is
179:31 - exactly what i did in my first company
179:34 - and then i basically went ahead and i
179:35 - was watching him and i was like dude
179:36 - like
179:37 - this is amazing man like you're and do
179:39 - it in a fashion where you
179:40 - you make them feel good right like if
179:43 - you go up someone say oh that's easy man
179:44 - yeah i can do that no one's gonna want
179:46 - to work with you right
179:48 - but if you go up to him say like that's
179:49 - awesome stuff can i please like learn
179:51 - from you would you mind sharing some
179:53 - tips
179:54 - i'm guarantee no one will say no to you
179:55 - like and if they do you just
179:57 - like you know be nice about it and and
179:59 - and move on like but the point is i
180:00 - pretty much said to him like i was like
180:02 - yeah like can i just pretty much shadow
180:03 - you next time you do a deployment next
180:05 - time you do
180:06 - any sort of ci work just give me a shout
180:08 - and and we started doing that
180:10 - now i picked up the skills required to
180:12 - take over the the devops position
180:14 - in the company and then he had to leave
180:17 - right so
180:18 - about seven months later he left right
180:21 - now
180:21 - think about it they were paying somebody
180:23 - 80 grand right
180:25 - to to fulfill this role and then they're
180:27 - paying me 50 grand so imagine like as in
180:29 - this is a hypothetical
180:31 - um situation but but um but i did use
180:33 - this in a different sort of
180:35 - the numbers were different but i did
180:36 - exactly this principle and i boosted my
180:38 - salary
180:39 - uh about 20k right and and the point is
180:42 - that like
180:42 - my he left the company and i said to him
180:45 - i was like
180:46 - i am now doing devops plus i'm the full
180:49 - stack developer who has got my feet into
180:51 - loads of different parts of
180:52 - the software right there like i've done
180:54 - a lot of different and part of the app
180:56 - build and part of the web app
180:57 - that we've built and things like that
180:59 - and i also picked up react native on
181:00 - that job
181:02 - now justifying 20k as a pay rise when
181:05 - they were previously paying someone 80k
181:08 - is like you know like this is kind of a
181:11 - still
181:12 - right like now they don't have to pay
181:13 - someone 80k they're just paying you an
181:15 - extra 20k
181:16 - and you're doing the devops as well as
181:18 - the some development work
181:20 - right and do you see like it and now
181:23 - you've done them a favor so they
181:24 - actually like you a lot more
181:26 - and two you've got a lot more a whole
181:28 - lot more respect and authority in the
181:30 - company
181:31 - and you're also picking up skills which
181:33 - which remember
181:34 - uh you wanna and you wanna say yes to
181:37 - the opportunities which are gonna be
181:38 - uh like sort of um exponential in terms
181:41 - of your growth in the future right so
181:43 - picking up devops is gonna boost you big
181:45 - time in the future
181:46 - right learning redux is going to boost
181:48 - you big time learning react native is
181:49 - going to boost your big time
181:51 - but doing things like angular vs react
181:54 - that to me compared to like picking up
181:57 - devops is like a downward
181:58 - trajectory there's in this it's not a
182:00 - downward but it's kind of a much less
182:03 - it's not it's basically it's going to
182:04 - just like imagine if that's going to
182:06 - increase my development at this rate
182:07 - right it's only very very small amount
182:09 - but if i start learning devops my salary
182:12 - is going to quickly go
182:13 - up and it's going to really start to
182:15 - peak quite high
182:16 - um you know it is it it is worth to tell
182:19 - you
182:19 - these things what i am getting uh in
182:22 - return from you it is
182:23 - highly valuable for me at this time
182:25 - because i was
182:27 - i was preparing for you know my intro is
182:29 - getting screwed up
182:30 - because on the both the technologies
182:32 - which i am working on
182:34 - and it takes a lot of time to prepare
182:36 - for interviews
182:37 - it takes from ground zero to the
182:39 - complete you know yeah
182:41 - and it was very hard for me to remember
182:43 - each and every point
182:46 - in technology so so think of it this way
182:49 - it's only on one
182:50 - yeah yeah so think of it this way so
182:51 - remember if you ask me tomorrow to
182:54 - sonny do you remember how to do
182:57 - like uh do you remember how to how you
183:00 - used react navigation and had like
183:02 - customized headers and things like that
183:03 - and react native
183:04 - i'll tell you straight up no i was like
183:06 - i will tell you i did it at one point
183:08 - but uh if you said to me that you
183:10 - remember off the top of your head i'd be
183:11 - like no i don't remember the top of my
183:12 - head
183:12 - like i know it's possible i've done it
183:14 - in the past and even if i didn't do it
183:15 - in the past
183:16 - i know it's possible so it can be done
183:18 - right
183:19 - and then from that like you know that
183:21 - something can be done so it's just about
183:22 - figuring out how to get there
183:24 - right and so the first thing is is that
183:26 - if any of you get an opportunity
183:28 - take the opportunity right as in like if
183:30 - if there's a freelancing gig for
183:32 - a for react job yeah take it and
183:35 - it's like you tried that yeah yeah they
183:38 - literally go on up work sign up an
183:39 - account
183:40 - uh and then if you have an opportunity
183:42 - go ahead and take the opportunity right
183:43 - like if somebody offers you a job and
183:44 - even if it scares the crap out of you
183:47 - take the job right and it's literally a
183:50 - case of like imagine you're in a plane
183:52 - jump out the damn plane right and you
183:54 - will figure out how to survive on the
183:56 - way down
183:57 - right that's the kind of way i put it
183:58 - right like and you will figure out ways
184:00 - to survive
184:01 - right like you will definitely yeah yeah
184:03 - exactly you'll figure out some kind of
184:04 - crazy way to figure out like indonesia
184:07 - hope we have a parachute like you you'll
184:08 - make a parachute on the way down
184:10 - right that's what i found because
184:13 - unless you put yourself in that
184:15 - situation
184:16 - where you have that extreme pressure to
184:19 - perform
184:20 - right you're never going to be put in
184:22 - that situation like when
184:23 - our bodies are very like acclimatized to
184:25 - like never push ourselves further than
184:27 - we need to like if you're
184:28 - in a comfortable position and you're
184:30 - getting paid you're eating good
184:32 - everything's kind of like you know like
184:33 - your body's like i don't need to work
184:34 - harder than i am right now like it's all
184:36 - good
184:37 - right if you anyone who goes to the gym
184:39 - knows this right like you have days
184:40 - where you wake up and you're like
184:42 - uh i don't really need to like you know
184:44 - i don't need to go to the gym like i'm
184:45 - good
184:46 - right but there's going to be days where
184:48 - like but if you if you have
184:50 - if you signed up for like let's say like
184:52 - a a boxing
184:53 - fight right you know that fight is
184:55 - coming right like you know that if you
184:57 - don't fight
184:58 - your ass is going to get whooped right
185:00 - like if you
185:02 - so you're going to train like because
185:03 - you have that immense pressure now it's
185:05 - the same as in the development world
185:06 - right
185:06 - if you have a job and somebody's like
185:08 - right the deadline is in three weeks
185:11 - do whatever it takes to get that done
185:13 - now you're going to be networking if you
185:15 - need to network to find someone who will
185:16 - help you
185:17 - yeah you're going to be you're going to
185:18 - be learning react if you need to learn
185:20 - react you're going to be doing redux if
185:21 - you need to learn to relax but you're
185:23 - going to do
185:23 - crazy amount of in three weeks that
185:25 - you never would have done unless
185:27 - somebody had stuck it in front of you
185:28 - it's like kind of like a soft gun being
185:31 - pointed at your head right like is
185:32 - somebody saying right now
185:33 - now perform and then you're like oh
185:35 - okay i have to do it now
185:37 - right and and this is the case for a lot
185:39 - of things that we just
185:40 - as humans that we need some kind of
185:42 - stimulus to kind of like push
185:43 - us and what i would say is the best
185:45 - stimulus and the best part is is like
185:46 - you get paid
185:48 - right like you get paid for it so take
185:49 - the opportunity but if you don't take
185:51 - the opportunity
185:52 - you're not going to get paid and two
185:54 - you're not going to push yourself out of
185:55 - that comfort zone to the point where you
185:56 - would actually be
185:58 - really benefiting yourself if anything
186:01 - when you don't take that job most people
186:02 - see it as yeah i'm not gonna get paid
186:04 - two grand from that job
186:05 - but what i see as no you just lost two
186:07 - grand and you lost all of the
186:09 - opportunity cost of the learning that
186:11 - you would have got as well
186:12 - right so like yeah think of it that way
186:16 - yeah i committed that mistake yeah so
186:18 - think of it that way and then and then
186:20 - suddenly a 2000 job is no longer a 2000
186:22 - job it's 2000
186:24 - plus the opportunity to learn a hell of
186:26 - a lot which is infinitely valuable
186:28 - because you can coach with that
186:29 - information freelance with it and then
186:30 - another job with it
186:32 - so you see it i see yeah no i will take
186:34 - your advice here
186:36 - yeah yeah i will note it down here
186:38 - exactly
186:40 - um i'm glad you say that sunny
186:44 - by the way no awesome yeah because um
186:48 - i'm kind of finding myself in the middle
186:50 - of i have to
186:51 - you know uh where i'm working on a
186:53 - minimal viable
186:55 - chatbot or thing and then i'm like okay
186:58 - the chatbot is done yeah away the
187:00 - youtube dashboard oh wait the styling
187:02 - will wait the data oh why the hell is
187:05 - the firebase
187:06 - not working wait no notifications in
187:08 - firebase oh i'm working in react
187:10 - and sometimes i feel like having a lack
187:13 - of
187:13 - experience yeah um you know makes me
187:17 - not being able to over to always
187:20 - estimate
187:20 - how much things still need to be done
187:22 - yep so i'm trying to think of it and
187:25 - just be like okay no don't worry about
187:26 - that just
187:27 - what's minimal cut your losses
187:31 - you know almost got the parachute
187:33 - sometimes by accident
187:35 - i guess but um yeah so that's what i
187:38 - find hard
187:38 - yeah but i have to say um
187:42 - you know with the builds you guys uh
187:44 - have
187:45 - i i think i'm i'm i had enough
187:49 - experience to see the patterns
187:51 - yeah so with the whatsapp clone for
187:53 - example i had a very
187:55 - unstylish chatbot but now i may you know
187:57 - i used your tricks from the
187:59 - chat room and now i made it use your
188:02 - dashboard and
188:02 - i was never able to put the elements in
188:06 - one container and see it like okay this
188:08 - is a column direction
188:11 - display now i was just able to do it and
188:14 - that was just so amazing so
188:16 - i can definitely recommend everybody
188:19 - percent pay the bills and then
188:22 - take from it and then also uh save the
188:24 - builds on your computer
188:25 - yeah it's actually sort of a database
188:28 - and then
188:29 - be like um like oh where did i find this
188:32 - because actually
188:32 - building a chat but i have the whatsapp
188:34 - clone next to it
188:36 - yeah take it one step further push it to
188:38 - github
188:39 - so push it onto your own personal github
188:41 - and then you would like to see yeah
188:43 - yeah because because i even had this
188:45 - problem yesterday where
188:47 - we have an internal tool that me and
188:48 - qazi built and
188:50 - uh and then i was like i can't find
188:52 - the code and then
188:53 - uh i couldn't get through to kazi
188:55 - because kazi was doing something at a
188:56 - time
188:57 - and then i was um i was kind of
188:59 - scrambling around on like old
189:01 - an old external ssd and i was kind of
189:02 - like trying to find this code and i was
189:04 - like god damn it why didn't i just push
189:05 - this thing to github
189:07 - and uh and like it we all make the
189:09 - mistake
189:10 - but the one thing is if you just push
189:11 - that code get up now it's it's it's
189:13 - gonna make your profile stand out a bit
189:14 - more i mean even if it's private it's
189:16 - still
189:16 - another repo on your account um and it's
189:19 - always like
189:20 - the amount of stuff that you're going to
189:22 - look back at as reference
189:24 - is it like your reference material is
189:27 - literally like golden because you wrote
189:28 - it
189:29 - right like as in if you wrote the
189:31 - material it's going to be golden it's
189:32 - going to be literally catered to you
189:34 - and how you work and how your brain
189:35 - works um and it's going to be something
189:38 - that you can always look back to and i
189:39 - always look back at old stuff and
189:42 - repurpose things and really like come
189:44 - back and i'll improve it and i'll kind
189:45 - of like uh
189:46 - i'll grab i'll be like i remember i did
189:49 - something in that project
189:50 - and i would kind of be like i just need
189:52 - to do that again so i'll go back and
189:54 - i'll grab that snippet accordingly okay
189:55 - done now now i don't need to spend hours
189:57 - on trying to figure it out and i can go
189:59 - ahead and grab
189:59 - it now something i want to go ahead and
190:02 - say
190:02 - um is nice because
190:06 - whenever you were saying niche you felt
190:07 - like you were calling my name out
190:11 - um jesse i want to add to what you were
190:13 - saying before so you you mentioned
190:14 - about the um uh sort of like uh
190:17 - some kind of like pressure to kind of
190:20 - like keep pushing you to do like the
190:21 - dashboard or another feature or
190:22 - something like that right
190:24 - like and i was kind of talking about um
190:27 - like the pressure of like a job or
190:29 - something like that is is
190:30 - like or a deadline for an app is is a
190:32 - really good motivator right
190:34 - but if you what happens if you don't
190:36 - have like most of us don't
190:37 - just start off with clients like we
190:39 - don't have clients right like what if
190:41 - you don't have a client how do you set
190:43 - yourself
190:43 - a goal to to push yourself and
190:46 - pressurize yourself into that position
190:48 - how do you get into that position
190:49 - without clients without deadlines and
190:51 - stuff like that because
190:52 - it's very difficult you might be
190:53 - thinking i can't because i i don't have
190:55 - a client so
190:56 - i'm not going to get that yeah i guess
190:58 - it depends on who you are
190:59 - as a person yeah what you want to
191:01 - achieve with programming to be honest
191:03 - um like i of course the client
191:06 - well the client or the business coach i
191:08 - told you about the
191:09 - you know that was really for me an
191:11 - incentive
191:12 - you know because i want to do good i
191:14 - want i want to make this a cool app
191:16 - you know so i said okay build the habit
191:19 - so first of all some people
191:20 - when they start out their energy is very
191:22 - high yeah
191:24 - and then when you start out their energy
191:25 - burns a little bit up you know they in
191:27 - one week they build a creative project
191:29 - they start out they work 50 hours on it
191:31 - you know
191:32 - let's say they're motivated and then
191:33 - they start burning up and then it slows
191:35 - down
191:36 - motivation goes down um and it burns up
191:40 - basically so what i've been trying to do
191:42 - i've been testing since summer
191:44 - a little bit how my energy management in
191:47 - because that's a very important thing
191:48 - when you're developing your energy
191:50 - management
191:51 - i have the tendency also sometimes
191:53 - especially when i just
191:55 - um solved a bug i tend to be like
191:58 - i have to sleep at 11 but i tend to
192:00 - start you know be coding at one
192:02 - yeah every 1am i have to stop myself
192:05 - because i want also
192:06 - to be able to code the next day with a
192:09 - fresh mind
192:10 - so to keep to to not do this to not
192:12 - spike you have to do like one percent
192:14 - two percent one percent
192:16 - and then you build it up so that's the
192:17 - first you got to build the habit you got
192:19 - to have the discipline
192:20 - then yeah of course working towards
192:24 - the goal yep so you got to know yourself
192:27 - some people are extremely stressed
192:29 - when they start coming closer to the
192:32 - goal
192:32 - yeah so they're like paralyzed some
192:34 - people have that
192:35 - um i don't have that like i have a lot
192:37 - of ideas
192:38 - a lot of things and then just before the
192:40 - deadline i'm like
192:42 -  it that was way too much like yeah
192:44 - like strip it
192:45 - make it minimal just do this and i
192:48 - wouldn't i have not been able to deliver
192:50 - a project like
192:52 - 100 100 100 where i'm like okay i'm so
192:55 - incredibly um i you know
192:58 - because i always felt like okay this
192:59 - should have been in it this but
193:01 - if the client is happy and you did the
193:03 - communication well
193:05 - about the features the minimal features
193:07 - for that
193:08 - session uh then it's okay so i always
193:10 - have
193:11 - if i for my projects if i have a let's
193:13 - say 10 features
193:15 - the client has and i'm i'm aiming for 12
193:18 - but actually in my mind i have 15 lined
193:20 - up in the case of like i have that
193:23 - place of over delivery you know so that
193:25 - sort of stuff
193:26 - if you plan that on 15 in your schedule
193:28 - but you know you you come out on 10
193:31 - in the end you're still being able to
193:34 - get that deadline and have really good
193:36 - results so yeah
193:37 - it keeps me going two things you you
193:41 - touched on without
193:42 - realizing that which i really kind of
193:44 - live by now
193:45 - one is the the way of building habits
193:48 - right habits are a way of like like uh
193:51 - jesse said like and it's very true
193:53 - motivation dies uh motivation in the
193:55 - beginning is skyrocketed right like you
193:57 - are so pumped you're like i'm gonna be
193:59 - the best damn developer in the entire
194:00 - planet i'm with bill gates right
194:02 - like and then uh like as you code as you
194:05 - hit more debugging as you hit sort of
194:06 - like more pain points you're like
194:08 - that comes down and then your discipline
194:10 - has to kick in right
194:11 - now discipline by itself is very up and
194:14 - down like it's very like a roller
194:15 - coaster ride
194:16 - one day you're super disciplined and you
194:17 - do really well another day you're super
194:19 - lazy you don't do much
194:20 - so one thing that i found that really
194:22 - works is habits right habits is amazing
194:24 - um start with very simple habits right
194:27 - so literally like every single day
194:29 - uh read a book called atomic habits very
194:31 - very good book um
194:33 - yeah yeah exactly like it so
194:37 - atomic habits yeah atomic house very
194:40 - good book and uh i just bought that as
194:43 - well um
194:43 - so what i would say is is literally
194:45 - building a very like
194:47 - just imagine like if every single day
194:49 - you did and
194:50 - uh and like this is say two hours of
194:52 - work right
194:53 - in 10 hours a week that's 10 hours in a
194:56 - month that's 40 hours of development
194:57 - right
194:58 - but imagine the consistency of that the
194:59 - consistency of that
195:01 - is going to is going to be to a point
195:03 - imagine if every single day you put in
195:04 - two hours towards react
195:06 - right and then imagine on the seventh
195:08 - day if you're really tired and you're
195:10 - kind of like you know like i don't
195:11 - really want to do this i'm like oh
195:13 - i hear debugging or you've done that for
195:15 - six days now so breaking that streak or
195:17 - breaking that habit
195:18 - would is is a lot harder than kind of
195:21 - because now you're like
195:22 - oh like it will kind of eat you
195:24 - underneath and you've you've created
195:25 - your own internal pressure
195:27 - right which which pressures yourself so
195:29 - that is my first tip for
195:31 - and and i do that with kazi a lot and we
195:33 - we sort of go back and forth with
195:34 - streaks and things like that so like
195:36 - we have workout streaks we have
195:38 - different kind of work habits that was
195:39 - the first thing i would say and the
195:41 - second thing that you touched on what
195:42 - was it what did you say after that
195:43 - because it was a really good point
195:46 - um
195:49 - yes that exactly so there's a really
195:51 - another good book that everyone should
195:53 - read called the 10x rule by grant
195:55 - cardone
195:56 - right and 10x rule is one it's amazing
195:58 - for for money investment and things like
196:00 - that it's really good book to read but
196:01 - the
196:02 - the whole point of tax rule is if you
196:04 - want to get any form of success you need
196:06 - to do
196:07 - like like crazy amounts of work that
196:10 - other people just won't do
196:11 - right and what i mean by this and
196:13 - because like imagine if you go ahead and
196:15 - set yourself a goal like of
196:17 - of i'm gonna code um i'm gonna code um
196:21 - let's just say i'm gonna code an hour a
196:22 - day every single day for the next week
196:25 - right now what grant cardone says is he
196:28 - says no like
196:29 - all right so 10x that right is it like
196:31 - and i'm
196:32 - just giving you an extreme example right
196:34 - like it's in like this is like a very
196:35 - extreme example
196:36 - but let's say okay let's say you said
196:38 - you're going to call 30 minutes a day
196:39 - but then grand cardone would say like
196:41 - 10x it
196:42 - so so but but he but he tends to talking
196:45 - goals
196:45 - right so it would be your goal let's say
196:47 - if you want to make a um
196:50 - your goal was to make 20 000 by the end
196:52 - of the year
196:53 - he was a 10x sat to become 200 grand
196:56 - right
196:56 - now the point is is that even if you
196:58 - fall short of your goal
197:00 - chances are you're going to smash 20 000
197:03 - right because your goal was so high
197:05 - that like even if you've came short of
197:07 - it you would still surpass your original
197:08 - goal
197:09 - right yeah it's also what elon musk says
197:12 - right
197:14 - the goals that you have for 10 years why
197:16 - don't you set that for the next six
197:18 - months
197:18 - exactly exactly it's really impossible
197:22 - it's like well but you got a lot faster
197:24 - than if you would remind mind
197:25 - just 10 years exactly elon musk one of
197:27 - my best
197:28 - uh he's definitely something i look up
197:30 - to as well and that was a
197:31 - really good part yeah though he said to
197:33 - carry onto yeah no no it's okay i just
197:35 - wanted to pick on what you said about
197:36 - habits i think one really good book for
197:38 - everybody is the four
197:40 - tendencies from gretchen brewing okay uh
197:43 - which one is this
197:44 - four tendencies oh four tendency
197:47 - or two it's more like uh it is about the
197:50 - their your inner expectations and you're
197:53 - out the outer expectations
197:55 - so the inner expectation are you the
197:57 - kind of person that says if i have to
197:59 - run
198:00 - every day five kilometers will you do
198:01 - that yes
198:03 - people will do that you know once they
198:05 - set that bar for themselves
198:06 - the goal they do that no they don't want
198:09 - that street to be broken
198:11 - some people when you talk about our
198:13 - expectations
198:14 - is expectation from the client from your
198:16 - boss
198:17 - from your then some people say if
198:20 - somebody asks me something i will always
198:22 - do it so you have four four different
198:25 - personality types
198:26 - everybody is in some way some of the
198:29 - personality types
198:31 - but let's say you're a rebel you're
198:33 - below that
198:34 - it means like you don't really give a
198:37 -  about
198:38 - inner expectations but you don't even
198:40 -  about our expectations it means
198:43 - you're only motivated by what you do
198:45 - yourself you choose
198:47 - what you do for example you also have
198:50 - the questioner
198:51 - the questioner will only do the inner
198:53 - expectations
198:54 - right that person thinks is good for
198:55 - them but when he gets our expectations
198:59 - he will ask questions right and then you
199:02 - have other types of persons but it's
199:04 - really important to know that about
199:05 - yourself because when it comes to
199:07 - deadlines
199:08 - it's really um yeah good to see
199:11 - how do you behave around external
199:14 - expectations yeah for me i'm i'm sort of
199:18 - like between
199:19 - questioner but definitely a rebel so
199:22 - even if my boss would say it should be
199:24 - done by data then i would say
199:26 - okay great but i have to do this this
199:29 - and this
199:29 - you want me to do this or you want me to
199:31 - do that if that's possible we can switch
199:34 - this
199:34 - i can move this faster for you what do
199:36 - you like and then i just do my own stuff
199:38 - that's a typical question rebel
199:40 - kind of person an obliger for example an
199:44 - obliger is the kind of person that says
199:46 - boss says needs to be done by monday
199:48 - obliges
199:49 - okay no questions asked gets to work
199:53 - you know up holder will also
199:56 - uh but it's really interesting because
199:58 - the upholder is the kind of person
200:00 - that says i'm gonna run every day five
200:02 - kilometers
200:03 - he's gonna do it no doubt if the
200:05 - upholder says i'm gonna make 100k
200:08 - next year he will do it no questions
200:10 - asked
200:11 - and then it's really good to see if
200:14 - you're with teammates
200:16 - who's more of an obliger and who's more
200:18 - of a rebel
200:19 - yeah how the communication is so that's
200:21 - really a
200:22 - good point to know about yourself when
200:23 - it comes to deadlines that's just what i
200:25 - wanted
200:25 - amazing no amazing i think everyone go
200:27 - ahead and check out that sonny i have
200:29 - one technical question now
200:31 - yeah i want to design something which
200:34 - has uh you know
200:35 - uh unlike a view a list of items
200:38 - i get it from apis and i have to provide
200:41 - a links on it
200:42 - it is a single page application and i
200:46 - want
200:46 - when i will open one document or
200:49 - one record it will have a further you
200:52 - know
200:54 - tabs in it for for this sort of question
200:57 - for these sort of questions i'll tell
200:59 - you slack
200:59 - slack me uh because because it can get
201:01 - very granular
201:03 - um and it's kind of hard for me to send
201:04 - you those yeah um
201:07 - send this like yeah how i want to build
201:09 - it yeah yeah uh so it will help
201:11 - all of our community people too yeah no
201:13 - definitely go ahead and
201:14 - do that and that'll be that'll be
201:16 - awesome uh so guys takeaways from that
201:18 - read four tendencies right it's really
201:20 - really good book it's gonna help you
201:22 - guys a lot it's going to is
201:24 - any any kind of and also thank you
201:26 - calvin kabande says dude these calls are
201:27 - awesome keep it up and kudos to everyone
201:28 - chiming it
201:29 - amazing stuff thank you brother uh he's
201:31 - always charming in the course amazing
201:33 - guy
201:33 - and um what i would say is as well is um
201:36 - so a final sort of takeaway point is um
201:39 - [Music]
201:41 - oh damn it it was on the you know it's
201:43 - on the tip of your
201:44 - tongue was it i was gonna say it'll come
201:47 - back to me but the point is oh yeah so
201:49 - something really hit me recently and i
201:51 - was kind of reading
201:52 - a book as i was driving to melbourne's
201:54 - house and it was kind of like it's again
201:56 - it was part of 10x rule and it was
201:57 - make success your obligation right like
202:00 - we all look at success as a choice
202:02 - right everyone in this call right now we
202:03 - all look at successes like yeah uh
202:05 - it's a choice like i i ca i choose
202:08 - i can choose like some people just get
202:10 - it like you know but like or some people
202:12 - are born into it or something like that
202:14 - but no like
202:15 - change your relationship to success and
202:17 - make it like you are obliged to be
202:19 - successful if you don't do
202:21 - what it takes today like everyone's
202:24 - still on this call you're doing the
202:25 - exact thing right you're showing up
202:26 - you're still like here you're still like
202:28 - improving even if you get tired even if
202:30 - you feel like you know oh my god i've
202:32 - done too much whatever like
202:33 - keep on showing up because like if you
202:35 - don't do that you're literally
202:37 - being unfair to yourself because you're
202:39 - literally taking it away from you
202:41 - right so if you start thinking of it in
202:43 - that sense it becomes an
202:45 - entire different lifestyle and and
202:47 - decision making
202:49 - completely changes right even if your
202:50 - friends want to go out and things like
202:52 - that
202:52 - no but you are obliged to your success
202:54 - and if your success was to sit at home
202:56 - and and
202:56 - write code for three hours then you
202:58 - better stay at home and write code for
203:00 - three hours right like is in
203:01 - obviously there's always going to be a
203:02 - balance but the point is is that like if
203:04 - you want to achieve
203:05 - success you need to do like crazy things
203:07 - that people and the truth is that people
203:09 - who are successful if you look at
203:10 - everyone who's successful to like crazy
203:12 - amounts
203:13 - um jeff bezos elon musk um bill gates
203:16 - all these people
203:17 - they were at points in their lives they
203:19 - literally sat in a room
203:21 - and grinded so damn hard to the point
203:24 - where like
203:25 - nobody was sitting behind him saying
203:26 - like giving him a pat on the back saying
203:28 - you're going to be a millionaire
203:29 - you're going to be a billionaire like
203:30 - everyone's going to know your name and
203:31 - things like that
203:32 - you just absolutely have to like put in
203:35 - like ridiculous amounts of work to to
203:37 - scale up
203:38 - and it was only until i started doing
203:39 - that i saw my life actually start to
203:41 - transform
203:42 - and completely take a different
203:44 - direction ever and
203:46 - before that it was very much a case of
203:48 - you know like
203:49 - a kind of a small like a slower kind of
203:52 - progression
203:53 - um anish kara says just one question can
203:56 - hard work ever go to your waist okay so
203:59 - very good question actually so can hard
204:01 - work ever go to waste
204:02 - put it this way if you put in work no
204:04 - matter what it is right if you put in
204:06 - work in the gym
204:07 - right and you and you don't see a result
204:09 - if you put work in
204:10 - in sort of your in encoding and you fail
204:12 - and then you didn't whatever
204:14 - don't look at that as a failure look at
204:16 - it as no i tried something
204:18 - right like i said i tried something for
204:20 - example say you're coding react right
204:21 - you're coding and you're trying to do
204:22 - redux
204:23 - and it didn't work and everything failed
204:25 - right you must have taken a bunch of
204:27 - different approaches to solving that
204:29 - problem right
204:30 - now you you know that those different
204:32 - approaches don't work
204:33 - right so try a different approach and
204:35 - then and and that's all people do it
204:38 - doesn't matter how senior you are
204:40 - people have just ironed out more
204:41 - approaches than you that's all it is and
204:43 - you keep doing that and you start
204:44 - looking at and things like that
204:46 - and honestly that i forgot who said it
204:47 - but it's so damn true
204:49 - everyone has no idea what they're doing
204:51 - just at a different level
204:53 - right so like a ceo of a company
204:56 - literally is thinking in their head how
204:59 - the do i manage thousands of these
205:00 - like employees how the heck am i going
205:02 - to get everyone paid today like
205:03 - uh the the economy is crashing how do we
205:06 - how do we get everyone still getting
205:07 - paid like there's families on the line
205:09 - things like that
205:10 - right all of that stuff is that there's
205:13 - this sort of like
205:14 - the struggle of a ceo and then imagine
205:15 - it like a developer right how the hell
205:17 - do i get redux so i can i don't
205:19 - know how to get this thing working you
205:20 - know i don't know how to do it
205:21 - everyone has no i like as in and trust
205:24 - me when you go into a senior like
205:25 - now i i would be considered as a senior
205:28 - in in a development team
205:30 - and in and react anyway and if somebody
205:33 - says to me
205:34 - um yeah so this is true like he says
205:36 - thomas edison found 99 different ways of
205:38 - not inventing the light
205:39 - exactly so you see he just ruled out 99
205:41 - ways and then he got one
205:43 - and it all it takes is and but then that
205:45 - would be seen as and
205:46 - and you would typically see as overnight
205:48 - success or
205:50 - just natural genius and people would
205:52 - kind of tend to tend to put a label on
205:54 - it and because
205:54 - the truth is is that like naturally our
205:56 - bodies aren't inclined to to put
205:58 - ourselves in that much pressure
206:00 - right it's not much sort of like a
206:02 - pressure to perform to that extent and
206:04 - you don't want to kind of go and fail 99
206:07 - times
206:08 - you know like you don't really want to
206:09 - do that right but i'm telling you that's
206:11 - the truth and there's and
206:13 - a lot of people here exactly and and i
206:16 - went out albert einstein says something
206:18 - else i'm not smart i'm just willing to
206:19 - make more
206:19 - mistakes than the average person and
206:21 - that's the truth it was only until i
206:22 - started to kind of like
206:24 - dive out of my comfort zone and be
206:26 - comfortable with failing
206:28 - right if you're not failing then you're
206:31 - not pushing hard enough that's what i
206:32 - always say
206:33 - like keep it very simple right get on
206:36 - get comfortable with being uncomfortable
206:38 - that's my number one thing uh and
206:40 - literally like
206:41 - and if you're not failing like just push
206:44 - harder
206:44 - pretty much like when you start failing
206:46 - and you start like hitting
206:47 - actual failure points that's when you're
206:49 - like even like think of it in the gym
206:51 - if you put on a weight that's too heavy
206:53 - yeah they usually say like you fail like
206:55 - like or keep doing a bunch of reps until
206:58 - you hit failure right
206:59 - until you can't push that weight off now
207:01 - what do you do you don't just quit
207:03 - right if you quit what's the point of
207:04 - like training in the first place right
207:05 - you come back to the gym the next day
207:07 - you keep doing it like you you eat
207:09 - better you do other things like just
207:10 - like in coding
207:11 - if you don't get you you code every day
207:13 - but if you don't get your
207:14 - sleep right your brain is just like it's
207:17 - like a it's going to be fried
207:19 - right and i see loads of people like
207:20 - yeah i've been i've been up for for six
207:22 - days straight and then i'm you know i'm
207:24 - gonna be the best damn developer i've
207:25 - got like three hours sleep average this
207:27 - week
207:28 - that's not good right like you need to
207:30 - take care of your but your body is a
207:31 - vessel like you need to kind of like eat
207:33 - some eat right sleep right
207:35 - all of those things why we sleep is a
207:37 - really good book
207:38 - um i'd recommend everyone reads that
207:40 - it's really really good book um
207:42 - i didn't realize how much sleep did for

Cleaned transcript:

yo what is going on guys welcome to another video on the channel today we are gonna be diving into react native and it's gonna be a bunch of fun we have our amazing students over at profit with javascript our community that we've built out with our love and soul um so yeah it's gonna be a fun fun build today and uh we're gonna pretty much be streaming one of our coaching calls that we have inside the course so every tuesday i ran a coaching course and then today the focus is primarily around react native so if you've been wanting to learn about react native then smash the thumbs up button watch this video and get excited now i'm gonna go ahead and share everyone inside our amazing course so let's go ahead and show all of your beautiful faces say what's up guys let me go ahead and unmute everyone go ahead and unmute yourself guys hey guys you guys are live right now there we go that's it i see so many cameras turn on here we go that's what i'm talking about everyone's like yeah i want to be on youtube you know that's there awesome guys amazing right so we were pretty much having a conversation beforehand and i can see the numbers are coming in now so we've got loads of people joining this call right now um so yeah if you guys are enjoying it drop some comments and i can pretty much go ahead and if i get a chance i will go ahead and reply to some of those as well um but yeah guys carry on from the conversation we were saying we had a few questions came in before um one of the questions from was from a member in our team uh i remember from a community called saddam and he asked even if i'm a beginner should i be in this kind of call should i be in this kind of uh situation right now and i was answering pretty much yes 100 and even frank agreed that like you should be 100 in these kind of calls even if it doesn't make sense okay so you want to make sure you situate yourself around people who are kind of ahead of you and there's a rule of 33 which i live by okay and this rule like i promise you i think everyone should go ahead and live by this for one and it's very simple right you have split your life up into into thirds right so i'm going to go ahead and share my screen quickly and we'll start drawing on the screen uh last time i don't know if you guys remember my screen wasn't working my um my setup was a bit broken but now i should yes i have it back last time i had to do all sorts of crazy stuff just to get around that um let me quickly make you guys visible on my screen okay there we go so you want to split your life up into threes like thirds okay so i call it the 33 rule and honestly this rule has been the thing which has progressed me deeper oh man goddammit every single time i never learned one thing okay let me do that again 33 raw 33 raw okay there we go yeah so this is a 33 rule and basically you want to go ahead and like imagine your day right so imagine like this is your this is your entire day now i want you to split your day up or i'll try and i'm going to go a bit extreme right here and say split your day up into into a third right so you're going to have three different things or instead what i'll do is i'll just break it up into you want to spend a third of your time right you spend a third of it with somebody who is like slightly lower than your current level in whatever skill you're building so remember this doesn't just apply to programming it applies to if you want to get better at content creation videos whatever it is go ahead and spend a third of your time with somebody who is who is not as good as as that skill as you but let's go ahead and start with one that makes sense so spend a third of your time with somebody who is better than you right and not better than you as a person i'm saying more skilled at you as in whatever you want to learn so more spend it with somebody who is more skilled than you in the current domain that you're looking at right so this could be like if you're looking at somebody who's coding then you pretty much spend a third of your time with like a mentor like like myself or find yourself someone who is pretty good with react pretty good as a full stack developer and then what you want to do is spend a third of your time on your own level right now why what do i mean by this i mean if you bought a course for example everyone inside the pwj right now we have a bunch of modules inside the course that is where you're going to spend it at your own pace okay so this is where you spend spend um time at your own pace building the skill right building the skill right so imagine we have coding then you're pretty much going to be spending a third of your time remember this you've got to spend a third of your time with someone more skilled than you in the current domain a third of your time spend it at your own pace building that skill so be doing modules be doing youtube tutorials be watching like reading media articles and things like that because they're that's a situation where nobody is behind you saying you need to do this or you know like this is what you need to understand instead what you're doing is you're pretty much just going through a tutorial at your own pace if it doesn't make sense you can pause it you can kind of wait go make cup of tea come back and then kind of start again you know write down some notes it's all at your own leisure right but that's good but but sometimes we need that kind of like we need that we need somebody to be behind us saying like you know this is like the next level this is kind of like i want to make you uncomfortable and we're going to talk about like react native and redux and stuff like that today right and you might be thinking oh my god i have no idea i've never done this stuff before but it doesn't matter all you need to do is make sure that you spend your time around with that around that kind of a group of people or find yourself a mentor and that's going to progress you the most uh so far fastest and then the third year and the last study of time most people don't do this one and this is to be honest this is probably the the most effective thing is teach someone else your skill right so this really and i used to say teach someone who is like lower than your level or anything like that but i kind of scrapped that because you should just teach someone else your skill even if they're like somewhat decent at coding and things like that teach someone and now you can see you've got like if we go back to the way i was explaining before you have somebody who's above your skill level your you have then you have your own skill level and then you have somebody who is relatively below your skill level or even if they're not it's completely fine and you want to go ahead and teach them now this does many things for you which is actually increasing insanely beneficial it's going to allow you to go ahead and if you can explain redux then you know redux okay like if you can explain react then you know react so it enforces the knowledge right to a whole new level right so this is going to allow you to really kind of like grasp a concept now i can guarantee you if you know about like react hooks or something like that if i went up to you and said to you right okay teach me about reactos right most of us kind of like even even i would have done this in the beginning before i started teaching i would have been like oh uh well i know how to i know how to code it and i'll be like okay show me and you see like you have a different kind of pressure now because it's not like the typical pressure of what we're used to and it's like kind of like somebody's somebody's kind of asking us a test or a challenge or a question now it's like they're asking you to prove that you actually know what you're talking about and think about how this relates to real life when you're in an interview what's the first thing that they're going to do they're going to come up to you and say to you right um can you like maybe prove can you prove to me like what would we do in this situation if we wanted to have a thousand customers and they want to do like uh they want to they want to buy a product and how would we structure everything in this now you have to show them right and you have to get their trust in and and trust in that so they can trust that you know what you're talking about right and that happens the same thing with a student how many times have you gone into a university or some kind of college or or school situation and the the lecturer is telling you something or they're explaining some kind of concept and you're like damn like like how like they're kind of way ahead than i am right like they know what they're talking about because you trust them right because and then what happens is i guarantee they also had a point in time where they had no idea what they were talking about and it's like nobody is born into the world being like a react god right nobody knows react when you when you're one years old right nobody like you don't just come out with this stuff you you have to like you have to learn it and you have to spend time like at your own level building that skill and then by teaching it to someone else you then go ahead and reinforce it and you get much much faster at actually understanding and using that skill right so these are the three fundamentals the reason why i want to start off with that is because honestly like there's a lot of overlooked points here like this one if you how many people in this call right now i'm going to go ahead and quickly bring back the the students how many of you guys in the core right now actually have a mentor that you are looking up to besides me besides me besides nars um besides kazi like do you have anyone else whether it be another student or anyone go ahead and just raise your hand if you have some other kind of mentor dang it sonny you took it away i was going to say nas are quasi oh yeah so the reason why i'm pushing is because i'm trying to make it like a bit of an uncomfortable jump right so in pwj it's given right so like i'm a mentor to you guys so we've got two shower we've got anand um let's go ahead and um we've got imran okay we've got danny sing okay nice so you guys all have mentors right huda so hada i'm sorry if i pronounced it wrong um but uh but remember like guys uh firstly i actually want to ask you so tushar you first how did you go ahead and find and thank you so much frank for dropping that a donation appreciate that dude thank you man um yeah so go ahead and tasha how did you get somebody to to sort of uh uh how did you find a mentor yeah actually it's uh like uh in my firm only where i'm working so there was uh there's a guy who used to parttime consult like he was not working in our company but he used to consult right so there was a time when i had a chance to work with him okay and we you know like we clicked and the way we were pairing up and doing stuff like we were awake till nine three a.m and working on stuff and it clipped around and the way he does uh stuff you know like designing uh architect structure or getting something done or getting some bug fixes right so that was the thing i look up to him like he used to create something new every month after every three months he will do some project on uh this small uh arm architecture like small chipsets some robotics right he will make some uh door locks or anything anything besides you know apart from coding and even in coding uh what he used to do is he used to learn something new and then he used to teach others also that new thing right so that was the main thing which i got you know uh like i was looking up to him like as a mentor and he really helps everybody yeah amazing dude and and and let me ask you a simple question of like since you started looking at him like a sort of mentoring uh getting mentorship by him how did you progress in sort of your level as a developer yeah it actually uh when i was working uh like we had a project and i had to work on the i was working on the old angular project angular one and then we have to suddenly move on to new angular like angular latest seven or eight version right and it was a move to type script and i was not much aware uh like i've not never worked on it and i was like feeling you know bit scared like it's difficult or something like that right uh then he was like you know i have done it i'll teach you know everybody yeah then he conducted a session like for three four guys he called uh him to his place and he was like i will teach him there is any daughter your short introduction and then the way he explained you know and then i caught up with things and i was uh like i grabbed it and i'm working on that you know my latest angular for new project so that's really amazing dude and that's it like all it takes is that initial sort of jumping and it can be scary like it can be somewhat of a thing like you know like you might be wondering like oh am i going to sound stupid or am i going to like say something dumb because i used to be in the same situation that would be a job and i'd be like i don't want to say the wrong thing i don't i you know in the beginning you have this perception that you're not allowed to kind of go to the seniors or for some reason that there's just kind of a war between you and the seniors and it's not like there's nothing that you can pretty much go ahead and just you know jump into it so that's amazing thank you for sharing that dude um we have another person who actually raised their hand so we actually had imran anand nice go ahead go go for it and how did you meet your mentor yeah so i i met him uh through a discord server actually there were a few groups of people who were looking to uh to work in a react project so yeah through uh through that uh i just joined it and i thought okay i'll see what all things are going on and as as soon as i went in there was one guy who was very active in the group so i just dm'd him and then i got reply after a few months and then eventually it started that was one of my mentors and then second one is in my organization where i work right so i work in dotnet sector so there was one guy who was looking for a person who can help him in building an internal project so it was internal open source project so i just volunteered from him volunteered for it and day before yesterday that side got live internally and um in his he's a team lead and he taught me about all those atomic design and how would we use it and all that stuff so amazing in the weekends uh we just get on a call and sometimes and then we just discuss it over it amazing dude that's exactly like that's the way to move forward um and and um i forgot what was the last point you mentioned you just mentioned something quite good uh just repeat that last point yeah so i wasn't able to join any of the live coaching calls last week yeah because i was in my free time from off office hours i was working on a react project that was an internal open source project for my organization right and it just went live day before yesterday okay and i got a lot of appreciation from my managers and all that nice i didn't do a very big thing it was just a very small contribution in the site but yeah we were people of four four people were there yeah and in that the person who was there the team lead he became my mentor nice dude that is amazing that is amazing and uh and what you want to do is position yourself in in like in situations that like are going to make you uncomfortable i can guarantee when you went into that position initially you were kind of like you were uncertain you must have been like a bit kind of nervous and and you know like and and i guarantee now like you probably made a good relationship with with that guy and uh and that's gonna definitely be something and the thing is you really do hold on to um those relationships because there's been situations where i've been stuck in really tight debugging situations where like you just wanna like scream at the computer right like like if nothing is going your way and it's kind of everything's breaking and um and that's when you i i have actually like reached out to a lot of the people i built a network with and kind of said like hey dude look i'm in a rut i have no idea how to get past this uh i have a client he's gonna he's paying x amount like can you help me out and i'll message a bunch of them i don't just message one this is the problem right we end up making like one friend in the coding world and we're like yeah yeah i'm networked up like no honestly guys you need to remember they're to be busy with your your someone who you usually reach out to you might just be completely busy and there's nothing wrong with that instead if i get super stuck i will message like 10 of my like my sort of developer friends who i'm like you know they might be able to help me out and i'll just literally send them the same message i'll be like yo what's up man like i'm kind of stuck i'm a bit over up like any chance you can help me out with this and i'll kind of like post a snippet on on i'll use something like rebel if it's simple and i'll share the code and what i'm kind of facing or if it's really intricate i'll share a github it depends on the sensitivity of what you're sharing as well but that's going to really progress you as a developer in my last job i was working with somebody who was a really seasoned frontend developer and i can promise you guys there is not a single tutorial in the entire planet that will teach me as much as i i sort of learned by just being with that guy who is so experienced in as a frontend developer the way they critique your work the way they kind of attack you with like this is you shouldn't do this like in the way that they say like you should do this and that the point is is why did why was it so effective it's because it's somebody who again we're going back to the onethird rule it's somebody who is above your skill level and you're pretty much just like you're just latching on to their sort of skill and and no matter what you surround yourself with that enough you'll get pulled up too right and then you get to a point where everyone always asks me the same question like saying how did you get so good at react and things like that guys i wasn't i wasn't like amazing at react like about a few years back i really wasn't i was kind of like uh that guy who was one of my friends said like hey have you ever coded him react i was like dude i've literally done jquery and that's about it and uh and now i'm like coding up these apps super quick and things like that and it's just repetition my practice but the main thing for me was mentors mentors right like finding a mentor finding somebody that you can work with and right now in this one room there are literally about 80 people inside this zoom core if you do not have somebody that you are like literally just use this as an opportunity to reach out to at least one person on this call right now and say hey you want to work on something or like hey do you want to let's talk about some some react stuff or like hey let's maybe like have an hour call you know if you're not doing that then you're literally cutting yourself short already because you might there might be a perfect mentor for you in here like i already know that we can mention a few people like priyanshu super young developer absolutely killing it he's made about he's making 330 dollars a month and and he's young and he's based in india so never let age location anything like that stand in your way and you have access to the people inside the course so you can who can go ahead and do that you have people like frank seasoned developers landed huge huge contracts which are which is like i've never touched a contract as big as what frank had done so again like if i wanted to go back into freelancing world who do you think i'm going to speak to i'm going to go and speak straight to frank you know like i'm going to talk to him and say like dude how did you you know what was the best thing that you did in that situation because there's no point reinventing the world it's like if you're going to code up a date picker in react right i'm not going to code that i'm going to go and find a date pick a module which has loads of stars on github and i'm going to pull that into my project and figure out how to use it i'm not going to reinvent the world and things like that unless i absolutely have to that's when i would do that right so um everyone on youtube everyone in this call make sure you're at least like inside anyone inside of pwj use the community use the slack channel and really dive in and make sure you're asking somebody else or finding somebody else to work with on a on a regular basis and and honestly cycle it up you'll make so many friends like it's crazy like especially in pwg we have like 2 000 students right now um and also yeah that's another thing you have like so many more friends because like a lot of coders can be tend to be naturally introverted right like we like coding we like doing our thing on the computer um so where's the best place to find someone likeminded to you on the course right like on this on this platform if you if you're not enrolled in the course then link in the description you can go ahead and check it out or you can pretty much go ahead and um literally in the comments you can pretty much go ahead and check it out right like you can go ahead and say somebody reach out to me on this my linkedin like and pretty much is that simple right you can watch you can completely watch a whole nother channel on youtube and things like that you can watch like traversing media or something like that i'm pretty much just writing like hey anyone else want to pair program with me i'm working on some cool stuff someone will reach out to you i guarantee it someone will reach out to you if you do it enough and and that's going to be your start to building your network and trust me when i say that network is your net worth like literally if you go ahead and build out a crazy linkedin profile and i don't know how many of you guys like go ahead and raise your hand if you're into gary vee and his content right awesome crushing it very decently and i want so much value from it yeah he's absolutely killing it he released a bunch of like keynote slides and things like that which i definitely recommend reading and also he's talking about how like garyvee's is one of those people he he's very good at picking up on the trends that are about to blow up he predicted ticktock he predicted like twitter when he was going up he did a lot of like sort of early predictions and now he's predicting linkedin is another one because on facebook on all those platforms they're very highly saturated where you would post a video and it's only going to go to your followers or like a small majority of other people on linkedin it's crazy you could post something right now include a couple of hashtags and that is going to get reached to so many people in that space right so imagine like the potential if you're dropping value after value after value after value every time you learn something write linkedin post share it boom shoot a little video saying like hey i just learned something new don't worry about looking stupid or looking shy like we all literally here's here's a trick everyone looks stupid in the beginning right like that's something that i will completely break down even the junior developer when you first propose like hey guys we should use this firebase like um database thing uh in the beginning i guarantee the first time you pitch it to your team you're going to kind of look a bit silly and they're going to look at you like you know how much you know because because i did that i did that exact thing and they were looking at me like what is this guy talking about but then you prove them wrong you just carry on doing it like yeah well you know like i'm gonna build it anyway and uh if it works we can go ahead and implement it so that's my advice the thing that you talked about linkedin that's so true about you know linkedin uh that's basically seo and i also i happen to have a good pdf book and it's it's not like an amazing book but it's makes it relatively good and i learned about linkedin quite a lot from that book so if anyone's interesting actually i'll just drop it in the live channel just like a pdf and uh yeah i think that everyone will find a lot of value from it exactly uh exactly yeah nice so adam i see like adam's doing it right i'm down to work on projects together i've never worked with anyone else but i have experience in react i'm learning right now that's it dude that's literally like that's all you have to do like you got you have to just shoot your shot right like uh if i hadn't done that me and kazi wouldn't be working right now i literally cause i said to kazzy i was like yo dude i'm pretty good with react kazi was shooting some stuff on javascript next thing you know we came together and now this this whole thing is blew up right so if you don't shoot that shot if you don't ask someone if you don't honestly even right now go ahead and share linkedin's on on the chat in the zoom chat and things like that um share your linkedin say like connect with me start talking to people start shooting messages back and forth i want you guys to build a network and trust me there's already 80 people in a room that all want to learn about the same thing that's a pretty powerful network right like if you can't get 80 people to debug a situation and one person to figure it out then there's i'm just trust me like one person will figure out your problem right so you see what i'm saying like it becomes a very quick tool to becoming a powerful and on linkedin honestly like you if you start building like enough and dropping enough value and things like that like your reach gets so stupidly big that that um when it comes to finding jobs when it comes to doing all that stuff people just swarm at you like a do you know how many like friend can vouch for this do you know how many recruiter messages you have to go through it's crazy yeah i started i started charging for them to talk to me yeah honestly i'm saying i sent them an invoice now yeah really yeah that's genius dude yeah because they're always asking about like oh we have a referral how about i invoice you first that's genius that's amazing dude i love that and you actually did so frank did a genius thing with it when it came to resumes as well so yeah uh you reviewed people's resumes right one second imran i'll come to you uh next for a question yeah you were you reviewed resumes right on linkedin yeah i put it up i put it up on on linkedin that like hey guys you know i'm a senior developer um i i have a lot of experience like hiring folks and kind of like the interview process like i can help you get less nervous if you're looking for a mobile role and now i guess i'm like react native guy again that's amazing dude and it's like and i did a mock interview with the person yeah and it was an hour long interview and they're like well but frank it's a long interview i was like most interviews are at least two hours you have to get the stamina for it so it was mock interviews real questions you know real projects and then also uh reviewed their uh their resume yeah and then it was it was very successful so it's it's linkedin is very powerful exactly really i think i'm gonna start i got i got the microphone coming you know nice to meet some quick little little snippets like yeah video on linkedin is powerful exactly i know and that goes to and before i'm definitely going to come to your mind in one sec um that actually goes to one point i want to mention and this was something i was very hesitant about before but like even small things like like upgrading a camera rig and things like that right upgrading camera upgrading mics and things like that like you might think of it as like oh they're just kind of fancy gadgets right they're kind of like you know it looks cool it kind of but the truth is it's an investment back into yourself just as much as like a book is just as much as much as a because the thing is like you buy a camera like if you i mean most people people could buy a camera they didn't never learn how to use it right but the goal is you want to buy stuff and and pretty much figure out like how it's going to benefit you don't buy random stuff by the way that was that didn't mean that in a generic way all right buy books that are going to help you if you're not reading right now pick up audible because i can't i personally am not a fan of reading i i prefer audio books i i'll go for a walk i'll go for a run and i'll have all the like audio just being read to me in my ear so it's pretty much it's very easy like way of consuming media now and you just have yeah preentry that's actually i'm going to highlight you one sec dude this book guys soft skills by john sonmez i've read like 14 chapters already and trust me i this is the best investment i've made yeah nice investment one hundred percent you know at least buy this book like you're never gonna regret a book like this because it's phenomenal like he talks about you know how to start with freelancing he even talks about you know how do you approach someone he talks about niches and he talks about all those kinds of stuff he talks about marketing yourself and so much more guys like just just buy this book or read it on audible as uh sunny said it's available it's amazing just just take the action of buying this at least exactly dude like a 100 percent soft skills by john thomas it completely changed the way i started building clients and building uh everyone and and it was when i took my sort of freelancing journey from somewhat of like a more of a hobby kind of ish thing to something that could support me financially completely just 100 yeah exactly and then guys it's more a case of like take it from from actual like you could always kind of read it in an article you can read it and it's not but when you see someone like even like priyanka when you see them without frank or shrika like they're kind of they're breaking the sort of like you know what is what the kind of normal what we're told to believe what we're kind of told to kind of think is is the reality like you know you have to work two years to earn this much money or you have to work x way to make certain kind of money like screw all of that stuff and just listen to the tips and tricks from people who have done it and and trust me you'll just skip all the riff raff and remember you don't want to following the same path everyone else is following isn't the right way right just because everyone else is going that way it just goes the other way like it's scary yeah sure like we've all taken that risk we've all taken that dive into even the first time i learnt re i took it i literally took a job where redux was a main requirement i blagged my way through the interview and i just picked it up on the train ride in to work i was literally watching youtube and i figured out redux on the first week by just watching video after video after video and i used some dodgy ios app to download the youtube videos before youtube premium was the thing so you see like you make it work right but imran you had a question uh i think he is oh what's up jesse hey welcome yo sonic and the question was what what are the aspects of you what are the difficult aspects of using functional components in reject what was the difference between functional sorry no no what are the most difficult aspects of using function component in react okay so what are the most difficult uh like uh sort of concepts or areas of using functional components inside of react effects aspects okay so what is the most difficult aspects of using um functional components inside of react what i would have said another component functional component right so so the question so is this for an interview this would they ask you this yeah okay so firstly it's a strange question in an interview um about but what i would say is is it the difficult uh what is it difficult for you guys or for me like what's yeah yeah that's what i would say i'd be like are you guys i'd be like can you clarify that one of those questions yeah i'd be like do you do you guys know how to use your functional components like this kind of you should also yeah also whenever when you're doing interviews also it's okay to like not know everything yeah just it's okay to say can you explain that a little bit better what what what aspect of what yes to write it to to use it inside of a nested function somewhere else like you know or you know what specifically like you know it's okay to ask questions to clarify because sometimes people have interview questions that are like very kind of like they're the ones that know it nobody else knows it yeah so you have to kind of get a little bit more information that's part of the skills yeah and guys never get disheartened like you know how many times i've been in an interview and they've made me feel really dumb because they've asked me like some crazy algorithm kind of question and the truth is is that i didn't know i just had no idea how to answer it i've answered some of them i've broken down others and this and that but like there are going to be situations where they'll catch you out and they kind of ask you some strange question and the truth is is that that again it's not actually down to what questions you're being asked it's about selling yourself as a as a developer as some value to the company so you can actually flip an entire interview which i've done before where they've kind of came in with the sort of technical we're going to ask you this this this and then before you know it you're now talking about some experiences where you got into a debugging situation for for a week straight and and how you overcame it and you're just talking about your story so you can flip that you can you can completely flip those situations and it's something you can do but to answer imran's question um what are the most difficult aspects of functional components inside of react what i would say is before what would have happened is functional components were amazing for many reasons but the reason why they were limited was because you couldn't have state inside of a functional component right and that was very limited and that meant that we couldn't have um we couldn't have a sensual functionality inside of a component so we had to kind of if we needed state we would have to kind of convert it to a classbased component use the constructor and things like that and have everything set up and then you'd be able to use state in the component now that's when react hooks came in and you see what they might have been doing here is testing that oh do they know what does he know about react hooks or you see like it could have been like an actual sort of like a side question to kind of check if you know about react hooks but it wasn't mentioned in that way and then what i'd say is yeah but that react hooks came in and now it's actually extremely easy using the use state hook to now have state inside of a functional component so if you asked me what i would build a class based or functional i would now go with a functional component for many reasons like it's easier to write it's easier to read and maintain the use effect hook actually replaces the life cycle methods inside of a classbased component if you start dropping that on them then they're just like holy okay like this person is up to date they know their stuff right okay that's cool like you see and then you can kind of then you can at that point you can be like oh actually um there's actually a really cool website called use hooks.com and and then they'll be like oh really like that's a cool website and uh and then but yeah i used one for firestore like and you see like take your skill that much further and uh you kind of flip the script on these kind of conversations and you just win their trust because they're like oh he answered my question and he went that extra step and he knows his stuff thank you thank you very much amazing don't worry dude thank you um but again that's a very open question yeah and yeah it's always good to kind of unpack things and say okay it's like okay i can talk to you like what they are well the definition is like what exactly are you looking for like are you looking for like you know why they got updated recently and like react you know 17 like what what what exactly are we looking for yeah it's okay to ask to expand stuff yeah and never feel like you're wrong by asking them because sometimes the person interview and i mean i've had it where like and it's only through actually carrying out the interviews i realized this like some people interviewing you are just kind of as nervous sometimes weirdly as you like they kind of don't actually hold the interview that great either and they can kind of come across it depends like a very um a very experienced like kind of senior developer might actually be able to carry an interview really well right they'll be able to know if like because the truth is that if i was interviewing anyone inside this core right now uh yeah sure i'd be looking at elements of tech and i'll be this now but i'd be looking at you sort of your approach to overcoming if you hear a debugging situation so if if i said to you right i would write like a little test sort of react app and i'd kind of have an intentional bug in there somewhere and i would pretty much go ahead and be like i'll just kind of watch you and be like yo like just go ahead and you can jump in ask me questions what and the truth is is that i would want i'd be more interested in the person was like um i have a question about this so this is where the state is getting set up right and it seems like that shouldn't be there um but i'm not 100 sure like that person is you know at least they're asking the question but you'll get somebody else who would kind of like sit there and kind of like tinker around with it make a mistake think around with it make a mistake a bit no no i know this don't worry take her out make a mistake and now that person is killing through time right they're coming through time they're burning through things and they're letting the ego their sort of ego stop them from asking that question and that's the kind of developer that you kind of want somebody who um who is very like open mindset to learning um also a really cool cool note i'm just going to highlight on the screen we've got mohit mo via who he says on youtube he says thank you very much sonia and kazi because of you i landed my first job on upwork thank you very much that's awesome hey awesome stuff dude um amazing and um yeah okay cool um so yeah i think that's pretty much concludes that sort of section of what we're talking about i think what we should do now is let's dive into um a react quickly a react but i want to kind of run over the difference between a class based and functional because that we talked about i think it'd be very quick really nice sort of quick sort of run through and i can explain an extension that you should all be using um called es6 redux snippets and things like that and then once we get we're going to kind of go through that at a quite a fast pace and then we're going to do uh we're going to go ahead and set up our first react native app okay so let's go ahead yeah sharika actually that's a good point so sharika built so the backstory behind sharika he was part of a hackathon um and shrika i mean you can tell the story dude go for it you're alive dude what story um so the hackathon uh app that you've built and and you want to share your um i won a few prizes last weekend nice one uh i won best use of google cloud at your hackathon yep oh best uix hack nice and uh oh second place startup yeah i've heard the app it's basically a wildfire app where it notifies people on like pollution and fires near them and they can also read up on news amazing and dude how old are you 13 13 guys that is killer yeah so that's amazing and you wanted to show us so uh shriek is using something called expo to sort of develop an app and what he what you can do in expo is it will only work for everyone who's downloaded it but it's very simple as long as you've got a qr scanner you can try what we're about to do um but i think what he's done is you can code up your app and then you can actually sort of get everyone else to sort of test the app on their phone on their computer by using a qr code so um srika do you want to go ahead and actually share that qr code uh yeah wait one second okay so once he shared that all you need is you're on ios you just pull out the camera app on android i think you have a qr code scanner you just pull that up and you'll be able to scan this if you don't have expo the app installed on your phone it should just go ahead and and take you to the app store i think but here we go awesome so go ahead open up and let's go ahead and i'm going to point my phone at that and it says open in expo so i'm going to show it on it asks for your location accept it because there's actually some pretty relevant location type things in there so right so we're going to trust shrieker on this one guys he's not gonna hack us nice um let's go ahead and see okay so mine's loading up right now it says oh is this it right welcome to dude i love the ui i thought this was like a a screen forum i'm going to go ahead and show this on the on the screen right now so my phone's cracked so you guys might not be able to see that but oh i haven't got auto focus on you can see the ui is uh it's actually pretty nice right so they can't they can't really see it fully damn it um i'll turn it off focus on next time but um okay so welcome to one let me go ahead and register an account and um it would be really cool if i could show this on the screen okay so i'm gonna register i'm gonna say sunny oh sonny there's a way to do it oh yeah oh you can do it right so you can actually do if you do like a usb connector or something just like charge your phone with your computer yeah but the thing is i think actually so you can do it through um let me go ahead and i don't have my wire here uh okay what i'll do is i'll go ahead and i share it on this so on youtube i think they can see it a little bit i mean i think you guys can see it a bit but it's not gonna work out properly um okay dude i'll run through it anyway so we've got i'm going to enter my email address anger at jim oh god i didn't realize i was actually murmuring now and then i'm going to put a password in okay and guys all you need to do if you want to interact with this now is scan that qr code and you guys can test it out so i'm going to hit register and then oh nice dude holy crap okay so guys this is the screen that is taking me to so it says dashboard right so you guys might not might be able to see that it says dashboard my phone is correct i know and what it says is it's got heat maps it's got air quality temperature so it's actually found my location it's got the air quality and temperature and it's got the heat maps i'll tell you what actually if this is running on your computer right now shrika do you mind hitting run in web browser yes yeah so if you go ahead and hit run in web browser this should spin it up on a web browser we should be able to actually show everyone this and you can go ahead and demo your app but this is cool dude you've got news feed we have nearby fires we have notifications um oh my god this is sick okay nice and uh shrika how long did this take sorry i am not able to do it i tried to scan it right you scan life but it is not working okay so when you scanned it did it say open in expo it says okay and there is a url in it it says okay and there's a url in it um okay so you need to have export yeah you need to install expo the app on your phone or export install yeah it's called expo client expo client yeah so ramy david was just asking yeah um oh i don't think it's working on my web browser i think it's because like there's like a billion people just like yeah right now it might be oh nice look you've got loads of people jumping on um okay in that case what i can say is i guys take my word i man i'm going to set that that auto focus properly um this camera is known for auto focus as well um but basically what i can do is actually on the coaching call what i can do is maybe oh i have an idea dude i know how we're gonna do this i'm gonna stop your share and i'm gonna make my screen spotlighted and i will show you guys this way so i'm gonna replace the spotlight there we go i was able to install it so you guys can see this right so you guys can see he's got an app here and you can see it underneath and we'll make this experience better guys so like i will share my phone next time but you can see we've got these tabs at the bottom and as i click them it takes me to new screens there's a news feed right there's a full news feed which is awesome and even the design review and share it with other content contacts that you know nice dude and if you see at the top it says london so that's where i am right now it shows me my air quality the temperature and it will actually show so what is this at the bottom right here so heat maps oh nice okay i've clicked it oh damn okay this is cool right so i've just hit i've just hit heat maps and check this out guys it's actually showing me a map and the temperature zones around london which is insane and this was built with watch rico react native yeah react native nice and apis okay and how much um how long did this take i say how much how much to buy this did and uh and um how long did this take to to to go ahead and build um 24 to 36 hours what oh my god that is that is insane dude nice 26 today okay that is awesome so 26 30 hours around that time frame dude well done that is awesome man even if you like open up the new screen yeah it opens up a model okay you can share it to people you know right so i've clicked on these videos articles and then you'll actually get it oh really oh nice oh man and then it will open up but is it just the url that it's gonna so it's a modal when i click it it pulled up a model oh and that's like in in a safari kind of style browser right yes i got it i got it up on my um i can share my screen and i have it on my phone oh go for it dude go it so everyone watching whether it's youtube or in the call right now make sure you go ahead and download expo because we're going to be doing some cool stuff for that later hey there we go that's awesome so this is the homepage amazing yeah this is cool man so you won't register and log in login so go ahead and register you can just make maybe make a dummy account or something um and um i mean shrika how are you doing authentication right now hey i love it okay awesome bro this app is killer i i wouldn't have been able to make it like if you if you did it in 24 hours and yeah that's that's huge trust me congratulations you did it and i i wouldn't have expected anyone else to win that too seriously this app is really good like it it's set for production if you want to yeah honestly it's awesome man you you might as well make some money what phone are you using right now frank um i i have my hold on one second i got my text size a little bit larger oh all right that's probably why yeah i was wondering okay there we go yeah don't worry yeah i do expo too sharika was like goddammit what is this i do this on purpose to break my own app so this is again something that we're saying like yeah that's clever i never even thought that that's cool yeah well it's like you have to because like some like okay guys i'm working on an app also it's it's music based and sometimes the the name of the songs are really long so i have to i have to check for that kind of stuff so i make the text big make it small still make it uh unbreakable exactly yeah this is amazing guys like i'm here in austin texas uh i guess we have good air quality i'm not sure oh dude you're in texas nice i don't know got heat maps i still not able to get into it i still install expo yeah so guys remember expo what's happening is shrika set up a tunnel where he basically tunnels the connection to download the app and things like that when a lot of people can connect it can be very slow to download the bundle so don't worry if you can't connect to it now um but just understand that that's what you can do in export think about all the use cases for it but overall dude this app is sick this is really really cool amazing this is very fast yeah really really nice sunny i would like to know how what tools we are using to do this because i have a scan life and i installed expo on my phone iphone so how to make it work how to i scanned it it is again showing me the same screen um you most likely are running into like a little edge case dude so i would say maybe um share what you're seeing in the zoom chat or we can debug it afterwards on on slack just try and share it okay yep news feed it's amazing can you share the qr code again um guys i would say at this point honestly like uh because his tunnel is probably getting overwhelmed right now so maybe just just go ahead and use what frank was showing to pretty much look at what was possible with the app but shrika let's let's quickly run through uh a quick thing of of what did you use to go ahead and uh to build that so i'm guessing you would need used firebase authentication right uh yeah react native yeah and then a few like uh air quality apis and stuff okay nice and was they were they free or paid apis free nice okay so free apis firebase authentication is free to get set up and use um did you have a uh so for the navigation aspect of the app what were you using navigation awesome right so we have an event navigation that's gonna handle all the sort of page routing at the bottom of the screen um and then what else did you use that you would find did you use any kind of form of redox or state management nope okay so nice there you go unless this is answering a lot of questions right now where you don't need to over complicate the build with redux all the time we'll react context api most of us even i did in the beginning i was kind of like as soon as i build an app i have to set up redux i have to set up this i have to sell that don't do that because it just over complicates the build just go ahead and add what you need as and when you need it right that's going to be the best way to progress forward um expo is actually this is this is amazing man this is from a senior developer over here like i'm i'm very impressed yeah dude that short amount of time like congrats this is like really good work no doubt dude 100 like if you showed that to an employer to anybody yeah you'll be very very impressed you will get so i would recommend you to just apply for freelancing jobs and then show this app and make some more apps if you want to and then actually you can start freelancing right now so don't even don't even care about whatever anyone else tells you just make some accounts and go for it bro exactly exactly also we haven't speaking of jobs adnan razak says hey proper reactor i recently got a job in dolby germany as a javascript developer thank you for your videos you're just awesome amazing so loads of people getting jobs now that's crazy man um shrika just to show you right honestly if you went into um somebody said baby yoda of coding it's so funny you said that because there's literally a baby yoda in like in the corner of my room right now so if you're watching on youtube you can see it over there um but that's uh that's funny but um yeah if you were if you were to go into an interview right it doesn't matter what your resume looked like doesn't matter what anything look like you pulled that out and said yeah i built this go ahead and play with it right or scan this qr code and they would launch it with expo they would be able to by playing through it like as a sort of seasoned kind of developer i was like okay he must have used some kind of authentication regardless of what it was it's authentication which is not always an easy problem to solve um and especially for those people who don't know about firebase authentication um and then you also have the the fact of getting the app set up in the first place then you also have setting up with expo you did that successfully then you had react native navigation that's showing us like a million words just in that little and then and it's a fun way of showing skills right the one thing i'm against is when you kind of go into somebody's portfolio and it's like uh react native and there's a there's a progress bar and it's like 75 what does that mean right like if i see if i see a react bar and it's like please don't do that yeah it looks good in the website it's really hard to read though too because you know some people have like slower browsers and don't put don't put how many like some some people put years of experience but that's only for the recruiters like when you actually sit down in front of someone they'll say did you do four years of advanced stuff or did you do four years of not advanced stuff there's a huge difference exactly exactly this is this is in 24 hours man like what the heck dude and entry how many people were in your team it was just one person oh man that is sick and were you coding uh this is actually another handy question for everyone watching so you were pair programming with him was it next to each other or was it using like a vs code live share or that kind of stuff oh no dude we didn't do ps4 or anything it's just we collabed over github oh so this entire thing was over github as well yeah oh man it's even more impressive like you could literally so now you can share the repo share the honestly if you push that to your github have the qr code i'm not sure if you can actually host the demo on expo online yeah you can you can like publish the project so then anybody can scan the qr code then dude that is insane you know what to do that as a step one and step two release the app like literally take it that extra step and kind of release the app and say like this is a fire tracker things that it like costs a bit to release it waiting on the product i could show you exactly how to release it for free they have it free for students nice oh okay so guys that is literally an example real time of networking right like that is literally it so like not a hundred dollars they don't do that exactly so sharika speak to frank after and and dude we want to see that app in the app store and i can and even i can help you out with like test flight and things like that i was really impressed like this was very impressive for me yeah that's insane like trust me like i've seen so many um so many new apps that are coming in and they're gonna have good ui but this one is like you know having those round borders and all that kind of stuff and i think react native might come in with that but the navigation is smooth you are pulling in data from apis and you're doing authentication so there's a lot of complexity involved too and um yeah bro like i would be the first one to install that app yeah that's it honestly it's amazing dude sharika guess what somebody on youtube what's your email i have a mobile project for you so you might have just landed a client yeah so you might just land the client so go ahead and check out youtube the live chat um but uh already what was that tell them i already hired him [Laughter] nathan's already grabbed him nice for anyone who's wondering whether it's for android or ios just don't even care because it's for both react native does it for both yep exactly so that's the benefit of using react native as well um oh this is another question so when you set up the firebase authentication did you use react native firebase um so the neat little react native firebase package um i always forget their name but there's uh frank what's the name of it we we talked about it last time it's called rn firebase.io or something like that yeah rn firebase.io is that the one you use trico or did you use the a different approach uh yeah so like my teammate he was working on the firebase integration and backend but like he used he didn't specifically use ironfirebase.io right he like used it for documentation to help him along but he didn't install that package okay okay interesting interesting so did he install any kind of native dependencies or uh no not so sure okay cool no problem dude the main thing is you got it working so that's that's insane uh really really awesome it does it does the geo stuff so like it has to be installing something cool yeah oh yes yeah it does it checks it out and all that stuff so you would have had to install something um that's that's really like amazing stuff go ahead and show uh shrika some love in the in in the zoom chat and then just scream it out if you wanna because he deserves that that's crazy man um right so uh for everyone also for everyone um you've got loads of people messaging on youtube as well uh kanye g says congrats um mustafa mahmood says this is gonna be recorded yeah everything is recorded and uh and also badan azam shrika just dropped his email so you know do your thing get a little client going amazing so guys look making making like little little deals happen on the stream that's cool all right if it's not legit we're going to hunt you down yeah exactly we there's 88 people in this school that are going to network together you know we're very protective of the community exactly don't be a bad don't be bad a bad client exactly all right so guys i believed it yeah i believe that we can also make it in a react itself instead of react nature yeah so i did this yeah so remember using the api and location you can easily figure it out so remember there are differences right so it depends on what your your approach is so remember this is also a good question for anyone who's kind of confused as to what react is against react native um so react is essentially going to allow you to build something called a progressive web app right so it's it's an app that runs on a browser so the the benefits of a pwa progressive web app is that you can pretty much one the the the development time is extremely fast right so so developing a a pwa is a lot faster than developing a native app um that's from experience i think like people might argue otherwise but in my experience it's just a lot faster than developing it and now if you want to release the app it's also a click pretty much a case of like if you're using firebase anyway it's going to be firebase deploy in the cli and boom like your app is your up is pretty much you do npm run build first don't forget that guys uh and then you do then you do firebase deploy because i know how many times that caught everyone out um so that's going to be pretty much done but if you go ahead and create a say like you make some changes to an app version now you're going to have to go ahead and create and bump the version create another bundle uh deploy it so you on ios you do something called test flight and things like that you can do a bunch of different things i can't actually remember what test flight how we use it but but i used test flight in the past and then you basically go ahead and you have to get approval in the app store and the play store play store is generally more easy going the app store is a little bit more hard going and then you get to release your app right so there's a whole process kind of involved sure you can make it quicker um and you can actually get quite quick with that but use a lot of setup and things like that involved whereas on react is extremely fast and now react the benefit of a pwa is um if you develop a pwa if you can actually on on safari you can click on the little bottom button one with the little sort of arrow pointing up and you can actually click add to home screen on ios and i think you do the same for android and guys that actually kind of pretty much installs the app on your phone and when you open it that way it doesn't have now no longer the sort of um browser looking for it's like it's pretty much a native app at that point right so not many people know that but if you go ahead and do add to home screen you get a native app experience and if you deploy you're now getting the realtime sort of sort of uh deployment uh iteration uh benefit of using a pwg um pwa right so it's going to help you out in that sense but but obviously with that said it's not a native app native apps have a lot of uh sort of pros to using them as well you can tap into the sort of graphics card a lot more you can do a lot more sort of power intensive things you can sort of get to be fair you get the pwas are getting a lot more powerful but um there are pros and cons in our times for example push notifications on ios on a pwa you don't have that right which is why you usually opt for text messaging like twilio or something like that whereas when you're using um a react native you can push notifications and you can do something like firebase cloud messaging to make it work right so that's going to be um so that's going to be something to remember okay now with that said uh what we what we're going to do now is we're actually going to go ahead and build a react native app together with expo and sort of see how that goes and we can go through and run through the teething issues and this and that right um so now let's go ahead and do this so i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen and boom there we go so we got my screen going so i'm gonna move you guys a little bit out of the way for a sec and then i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna assume imagine like you're fresh you don't have a single idea about where to begin with this stuff so we're going to go ahead and do it together right so i'm going to go here i'm just going to type in react native right and i'm going to click on this right it's react native and we're going to pretty much it's very it's actually pretty simple to get up and running with this you could get started prerequisites blah blah blah interactive examples you can go ahead and this is expo they have these really nice things i think this is called snack uh is this the snacks that they talk about um i'm kind of still like yeah so that's an embedded snack okay so embedded snack nice one that looks a little bit more like i think if you click the edit or something it brings up kind of like um some kind of like uh yeah i think there like kind of like a small nice awesome so you get like a little vs code trainer cool man so this is this is awesome and what you can actually do is if you click on ios and you click tap to play i think they actually they actually have cloud devices that run so right now i'm queued up in a position so you can actually run this on a um a sort of a free web source thing so look it's actually running on an ios app right now um or on some sort of like cloud phone or something it says device connected and this is a great this is a great way if you put put this up on github or part of your portfolio it's good to have this because someone can just click on it and they can actually run your real app and so it's like you don't you don't necessarily need to have all the stuff approved on apple or anything like that you can just have um like a project that anybody could look at it's very it's very powerful when someone can click and start playing with your app exactly yeah and guys think about it like imagine if you if you could demo your app like this right it's really powerful right so you can go ahead and um let me just move my face because right now on uh youtube i think they can't see it so if i go ahead and hide my face so you guys can see this you say try edit um try editing me one two three if i go ahead and say try enemy someone say yo it's your boy papa react right and then it's i don't even have to hit save and it just kind of dynamically works right and now that's actually running on on a on an ios device right now you see like we didn't have to do any sort of setup right snacks are pretty much a cloud environment everything works out of the box and you can also test it on the web and android and this is another thing if you're doing development or you've never done any kind of native development you will know that setting up the development environments naturally without expo can be quite painful so you're gonna have to set up a bunch of prerequisites and bunch of sort of prework to go ahead and get that working and um this saves you a lot of headache when it comes to sort of as uh so what's the advantage of using react native cli over expo so why why do people even use it in production environment and why don't we use just uh expo every single web i don't see people using xp everywhere so yeah could you just mention that good question so firstly expo was relatively newer so well i mean it didn't really catch on as much until like now because when i was using it dude that's exactly what the case was right so i wasn't actually using expo i was using um the react native cli to be honest i had no mention of expo on the site and plus it depends on where you're going into so imagine you go into a company and bedan has um actually just emailed you shrika so i think you have you have a client going on right now so go ahead and check your inbox but imagine you're going to a company and they've been around for a while they've got everything working you want to actually go ahead and and sort of just fit into their sort of current workflow you know you don't want to be like yeah let's revamp everything to use export they'll be like no we've got everything working with android studio and and xcode and the simulator and also it may be more painful to set up but once you have everything set up with xcode and android studio it's still actually pretty good as as an environment but expo is actually export is is really good um but i've actually had quite a lot of success even with using um x uh x x code and android studio um but i was talking about expo yeah good question with the expo do you get like live reloads when you're like coding on on vs codes yes you do yeah and i'll show you i'll show you um because we're going to set everything up now so so we can go ahead and show you but you get everything you still get live reloading hot reloading all that stuff um you get all of this so everything you saw in this little demo that we showed right here you're going to be getting that same functionality um in expo yeah so you don't really need you don't really need android studio though yeah so this is the benefit so anyone who's worked with xcode or android studio before you will know that it it can be clunky there can be sort of like an update and that one update can it's like a couple of gigs sometime and it can kind of stop you from working and it just puts you in a really annoying middle ground whereas with expo what you can do is you can pretty much use their sort of i think it i don't know i mean like i think it's a simulator or something i can't really remember how i haven't used it enough to sort of give you a solid answer on it but the point is it's a lot easier to get up and running with expo than it is with the react native cli um and also once also yeah and also on expo remember you can also always use the expo app on your current uh device and then as you're updating it it'll live reload on your actual app yeah okay on your actual phone yeah oh that's awesome oh yeah yeah yeah yes it will work on cli but it's actually it's very quick to set up with expo yeah i could technically have an apple phone and an android phone like side by side and have it live reload on both and just mess it up yeah they even actually show this in one of their videos they're like hey check this out and they have like an ipad and iphones and it's like yeah it goes across the street yeah that's awesome and i guarantee if i said to you like right i'm going to start a timer and i want you to do it why won't one person do it with this here and then uh let me go ahead and mute whoever that is i can't see my thing frank i think uh yes if i gave two people a timer and i said right go ahead and set up um on and like if i said like an ipad an ios and a different phone and then go ahead and set up that with the cli and then go ahead and stay up with expo the person using export will win by a long shot trust me like it will be so much quicker and then the benefit of this also is like imagine like pedro was building an app right imagine he has a client he's building an app they want a react native app and then imagine like that client said hey like where are we at by the way like work is any any update on the app right now typically what you would do is you could share your screen and do it that way so that's going to be that's going to be cool right i guess it will it will show up running and things like that and as but what if you want to give them that actual kind of you know that that look and feel and they want to play with it themselves and break things and mess around with it so you could be like yeah scan the qr code and imagine that like then they scan it on their phone or you send the qr code to them they scan it on their phone now they get to actually go ahead and play and fill the app which is a whole different experience so obviously like just seeing somebody sharing an app on the on on a website or on a phone is one thing but once you get your phone and you're actually going there going ahead and scrolling through it that's going to be a whole different experience right and then that actually sort of wins that trust a lot easier so cool yeah yeah so that's going to be really powerful so now you can see here's pretty cool as well so we had a question earlier about functional components first classbased components they show you both example here in in so this is how you'd write a classbased component and this cellular function component um functional component so for those of you who don't know about the differences we have if i would recommend we rewatching a lot of the old coaching calls as well because we talk about we talk about this lot like a huge amount throughout some of the coaching calls the difference is how to write one to the other and things like that and go back um so they've been recorded and um but remember most people will say yeah i mean class components are old you don't need to know that only learn functional components i will say to you do not go with that approach i know it's the way that we all want to go because functional components is the best and they're nice and they're fresh and clean and yes if you're writing a new component 100 right in a functional component if you wrote in a classbased component i would kind of like jump through my computer and slap you i'm joking i'm kidding i'm not going to do that but the point is the point is is that you want to go ahead and write in function component but if you go into a company i can guarantee you they're going to have a bunch of like a lot of code which is going to be classbased okay and and you're going to need to work with classbased components so you're going to need to to make sure that works so we're going to go down to getting started where is it um uh we did this before i i couldn't even find against either so we've got core components um i'm gonna click where the heck is the getting started but environment setups out of the development environment okay here we go so expo cli so npm install dash g so i'm gonna open up a terminal make it super big for you guys see let's go ahead and also if you're not using spectacle make sure you download it it's really really handy tool so you can go ahead and just do like a lot of this stuff like rearranging your screen very quick um so it's really handy so i'm gonna do mpm install dash g expo cli which npm dash g install dash g music install that globally so it's going to install across your computer so you don't have to pretty much worry about if you want to use expo commands you can then use things like expo and knit and that will go ahead and allow you to set up an app um brian reading says i've got a question shoot dude on youtube if i see them on youtube i'll try and answer as many as i can um okay so and this is also another question so this is a really good one actually so debasis gracias says is mac required to develop and publish an ios app built using react native so this typically was the breaking point for ios developers so before you kind of needed to have a mac to to write an ios app right you kind of you did you needed like a mic because you needed xcode and if you didn't have xcode like tough you can really do it so you you might get this also guys you might get this error you need to do sudo whenever you do a global install so i'm going to write sudo then i'm going to go ahead and pop in the password there we go um so yeah and another another thing here that people always kind of get confused here sudo what it does is it gives you administrator access to your computer and then when it says password uh this is old school like unix so it doesn't like move forward as you're typing it stays in place so type in your normal password for your computer and it will stay in place and then press enter yeah a lot of people get stuck here like oh how does this work like that's one of the top stack overflow questions for react native exactly it really is actually the top one well one of the top ones one top 10 for sure damn yeah because because that's actually one of those things that i remember when i was first learning in terminal i was like why is nothing coming like nothing's coming on there and then the more i got familiar with linux and unix or stuff you kind of get familiar with that but yeah and this was a password if you don't mind [Laughter] see that's what you gotta watch out for guys that's what we call fishing it's like it's i love maravan yeah yeah i love mm365 that's it um right so what motherboard and an intel i7 cpu yeah 700k and what i did was i installed hack and toss on it yeah so like from past one year i it was on mac uh mac os mohawk and like last week i just updated it to catalina nice for ios 14.1 development yeah yes you can smooth we have no problem so it's also very cheap like indian 35 000 rupees you know i was able to create a cpu like with the full pledge nice awesome dude yes you can go the macintosh route um one thing i did want to mention which was the question that was asked before by that uh debauches gracias was that if you don't have a mac right the journey doesn't end there anymore because you have expo all right so expo now unlocks that development so you can then actually carry on with the development you can still build ios app you still got android app you still build a web app all through expo which is really game changer from before a lot of people didn't need um so kgf leak here says yes you need a mac no you don't you don't actually need a mac anymore you can actually still write the code and what you might be able to do is test with an android phone and then publish it to a snack test on one of their cloud sort of ios devices and that would work perfectly and it would work in sort of the way you expect it so you can go around that now uh which is here you still need a mac yes exactly so that's for react native cli you're going to need a mac yeah so that's going to be it it gets even better than this so so like what we do is um i set up a ci environment continuous integration nice so what that allows me to do is as i'm i'm doing everything to do with the code i'm able to push it up on github and then it automatically creates all of this stuff and then pushes it all the way to the test flight the thing that we were talking about before that's a way that you can use uh to test apps on on ios so not only do you not even need a mac like you don't even need any of it so amazing yeah you can do it automatically so um just you know this is the new way of doing it this is why it's very powerful this is why we're talking about it so javascript everywhere literally yeah up and down the whole stack so literally you guys know like you don't need a mac anymore that's a myth if you need uh publishing rights it's not 99 anymore i'll show you exactly how to do it um so that's good exactly you can also use a virtual virtual machine not not actually because it's like apple has a like one part of apple that's a little bit tricky is you have to create a certificate it's called a certificate yeah that certificate um it does require certain things it's it's a little bit harder to do there are services that will produce a certificate for you now so you don't even need a mac like that was the last thing holding it out certificate is something that you must use from apple to sign an app to put it up on the app store yeah and also virtual virtual environments get a bit clunky guys like i know they sound ideal but they like i've used them before and i've had to um but if now that i know about this other stuff that's out there i really would stay away from a virtual environment to be honest um there's a lot more other better solutions out there and like frank said if you if you want to go in the route of like devops and things like that or just as a hobby i would really recommend it because i i am pro that with frank because i did the same i set up a bunch of ci and it's so cool when it get when you get it working like you literally push your code and it just does this it does that it does everything else and then at the end of it you've just got all of your stuff that you would have done manually done for you so you can pretty much make it and that kind of goes into the automation world and sort of that sort of side of things but um really valuable by the way as a developer to know that um stuff it's really really like a selling point you can actually market yourself really well as a devops kind of slash full stack um so it helps it helps with your freelance freight also yeah because if you're able to do more things it's like yeah of course i wouldn't want anyone to want to learn that just off the bat if that's not what you want to do but you know you're you're a javascript developer and react developer then you start doing some mobile stuff and then you keep progressing and then one of the final things is being able to have a selfdeploying app so that's that's how you kind of level up this whole this whole thing exactly yeah exactly i just have a quick question go for it so here and i want to become a very good uh react and react native developer right yeah and i'm pretty sure that even frank could relate to this so what would be the ideal roadmap for someone like me who is just starting off with react and you know what would be my approach so should i start with classes should i start with functional components and how should i pretty uh you know progress up in that so that you know one day i can uh like even today i can of course go for a cl to a client for all that kind of stuff but right now i want to master react and react native right so what what could be the ideal roadmap for someone like me yeah there's this awesome youtube channel called clever programmer um love it carry on dude go for it i've heard of it um i think it's a really nice prank no i think i think part of it i think part of it is you know some of what sunny was talking about before right like the way that a lot of us got introduced to you know how sunny was doing it was by clones so there is an equivalent in the react native world for the clones so like start checking out some of the the stuff that they're doing try to see like the kind of newer ones uh the ones that are using expo actually the folks from expo they make clones too on expo there's a instagram expo it's like a very full featured uh clone of instagram all built in expo so it's almost like well you want to level up try to try to think about you know that same mentality like projects that are kind of already done um and then take little bits and pieces right deconstruct it try to do it yourself like follow along um so that's a react native route and you know what what sunny is doing you know with with the cone apps on um in in react it's it's the same thing it's like the more projects you do you'll see like you know like doing this this project with you know with the with the fires around me and like all that stuff like building that stuff in expos it's very powerful and if you have access to a device you can see it happening so you can see that red thing that it gives you react native it's like this terrible like this terrible screen that shows you like it just crashes right yeah it shows you how to deal it's it's way worse than just regular react yeah um it's just it's seeing kind of what projects are out there um following along some tutorials like little small stuff but that's that's how you level this part up right because i know that you you're looking at some some stuff like look at like the big projects and then kind of work backwards from there exactly like it literally take on more for everything that frank had pretty much said right now and uh while i'd add to it it's pretty much a case of like in terms of actionable points it there's there's literally like 20 i think 20 25 clones on clever programmer each one targets a different challenge in a different way um so i would recommend that like if you if you kind of feel that like you're hitting a lot of similarities um then go ahead and type check out like a completely different so for example the amazon fiveday challenge right that one we did uh stripe payment processing we used cloud functions on the backend we did loads of react front end we done firebase we did authentication everything was inside that build even um estate management with the react context api so we had loads of stuff that was involved in that build what i would recommend for you to do is go ahead and and one build up your pattern recognition by doing the builds right that's going to be the number one best way of just like dialing in on what is needed when do i how do i navigate between pages because you're always going to have these questions but when you actually put them into use cases that's when you're going to be dialing it in and sort of nailing you'll answer a ton of your own questions through them builds um you also run into like frank said you run into a lot of the bugs yourself like where uh react react js itself is very friendly with bugs right it's very quite like it's quite like easy to quickly spot a bug kind of fix it wouldn't say easy but you're going to get into situations where it's kind of like a bit more straightforward react native on the other hand is a lot more painful so what i would recommend is build your stamina with react and then kind of get very comfortable about debugging situations for a lot longer periods of time with react and then go towards react native because react native i definitely feel like you need a lot more patience and sort of um and um yeah patience is the word that would go with the full react native i've been into debugging situations where it's a lot more painful debugging and react native and react native also the dependencies for react when you let's say you install firebase in react you would just do npmi firebase right then you now have firebase inside your app uh if you're doing it with a react native you're gonna need to install the ios dependencies the android dependencies and then you're gonna have some additional kind of steps now there are there is documentation to do that but remember it might work perfectly fine on ios and then android will present its own weird bug so there are things like that that's why i kind of say build your stamina with with react which is a lot more easier to handle this stuff and then go forward and and dive into react native um but what you're doing right now preentry is you're being practical so you're actually going ahead landing clients you're not letting that become a block because i guarantee most people on the call right now don't get disheartened that like i don't know enough so i'm not going to put myself out there i would i would flip the script and put yourself out there and figure it out on the job honestly because it's yeah right now i wouldn't say that i'm i'm like i'm good i'm just a beginner that reacts but what do you see quite a lot of times happening is that you know there are going to be clients who want to learn html css javascript right so if you know even if you know html today like standing in one of his calls told us that you know if you know how to make a web page and if you know how to put up a landing page if you can teach that to someone else they can tell you yeah and yeah it's it does seem over exaggerated uh to a certain level but it's not trust me it's not because i i was able to land lines for web development and i wouldn't say that i'm a master web development so i think that anyone else could do it too so if you can you know like make some basic web pages and if you can learn javascript it trust me it hardly takes like a week to learn about html css and maybe a month at max to get good with javascript yeah and yeah i highly agree on the point that you mentioned about you know teaching and taking action and right now i'm gonna try to do that myself so i'm gonna pull up some you know react stuff up and uh i'll check it out sure amazing yeah 100 and just action it move forward with it and every day just make sure that you're either like contributing to it like some kind of build or something practical um because remember theory is like something that we kind of and that's the traditional education system teaches through theory and very little practical flip it just do practical and kind of pick up the theory when and as you need it right and that's gonna really kind of be a lot more beneficial to you and it means that your time is spent a lot better and and you're going to get a lot more return quicker i like to call it the applied computer science yeah like that's so theoretical it's like shut up i just yeah applied yes funny thing is you find out most professors who teach cannot even code to save their lives yes yes they can yeah yeah they can't and my school i found out my professor he had the tas teaching assistants who are you know know what they're doing they would rather uh be the ones to do the recitation so he just has the slices used for decades and just shows them and explains the same stuff and then you go to the recitation and then the tears are the one that will actually help you fix stuff yeah yeah exactly exactly it's like another really good thing about expo is that what we were just showing you with these snacks uh the snacks can be public so there are there's people that publish the snacks and then you can kind of see like okay that's how they did this this is how they did the header part and some people always underestimate the power of going to github and just reading some food up and you know you should do that quite a lot of times like just look at some files and then with pattern recognition again it comes along the way and i think that helped me yeah yeah like like look up like for instance like uh like a firebase expo snack yeah and look that up and if it's not updated i'll update one i'll create one myself i've had expo forever so um it's a good starting place and i think a lot of people will get value from it because then you'll start seeing like what's similar what's different some of the complexities and then run the code on your on your device you're like oh wow i can log in i can do this and that so it it's like we can technically most of what sunny was creating with um what's with some of these cones like maybe not the stripe one because that one has like a little bit different way of doing it but most of the other ones like the twitter clone and you know all of the clones you're able to turn that into like a react native expo experience yes so those kind of things are very very interesting and the the expo snacks are most of them are open most of them have people some of them aren't that good but some of them are really good they have different stars you know they have stars like just like github and check some of them out even though the guys from expo like i said their blog creates a lot of really interesting stuff like the push notifications they they did one with like the guys from pusher that's like another service that's not um that's not uh that that's not firebase that you can get exposed to that all kinds of different things and a lot of the stuff is like there for you for you to check out yeah so right now i'm actually focusing a lot on react so i i what i want to do is get my foot dirty and react first and once i'm quite comfortable with react i started looking to uh react native and try to build my own mobile app one day and uh yeah i definitely take that piece of advice that you just said frank and yeah i highly appreciate it thanks guys nice um one more question where we can use utilize this uh snack dot expo dot io where uh for from uh for building from scratch or uh we can um we can put the code and test it over there building a complete app there or how we can use it you can build you can build a complete act app except for a couple there's a couple small things you can't do so anything that's kind of like ui base is pretty pretty good but some of the stuff and expo snacks they don't have quite all the firebase stuff from the last time i checked all the firebase stuff that's like native um that's not like fully fully solved but they're getting they're getting pretty close um but you can do a lot of stuff there and then and then you run it on your own device like what we were saying before yeah yes we test it okay thank you very much exactly hey sonny hey you did just one more question yep uh like uh uh while we were discussing all these stuffs i just went to slag snack dot expo and i just played with the code and i felt like wow this is react native i mean you just replace a div with the view and then the text and all those things so exactly yeah that's right so what i wanted to ask is uh so if i say that i know uh react uh basics and intermediate stuff like redux and redux sagas and all those stuffs along with all my html and css and all those css and gs skills so what else do i need to transition from that react mindset to react native mindset um so this actually is a good question what i would say is simplify it right so you've already you already know react um think of what um what what frank was just talking about now like the practicality overrides everything so literally go ahead just kind of dive in and look at some of the snacks that are released because like you said like just by looking at a snack you just quickly realized like you quickly defeated that fear right you were like oh my god they're just replacing a div with a view and honestly that's kind of how it goes right like it's it's very small differences um and then you kind of build up from that um and then like rather than using react ruler you use react and native navigation and there's there's small differences like that but the main thing is is that like i would say just go ahead and and and look at the project and maybe set yourself like a little startup project right so maybe i'll start a project where you're going to need some kind of authentication some kind of navigation and and those kind of things and then just dive into it because honestly like again what you kind of asked there was what theory do i need to know flip it and instead just run head first and do practical and you will answer those questions you'll build up the theory that you need to know um through the actual practical application and thank you so much rika he says hey guys i'm back after reading some lunch oh damn i thought he was leaving um no just a lot of practical talk pretty much um about what you need to like how practical approaches to to um uh to sort of your learning is going to be a lot more uh a lot more beneficial um debashis says thanks only for answering my question i always thought that mac is required to build and publish an ios app but as you said it's no longer needed now this m this makes react me a very powerful yes that makes rea expo in react native very powerful to be a to be super clear uh yeah but you're welcome dude i'm gonna i'm gonna drop a link here for the uh this this guy's name is evan bacon he works for the the guys at expo and he did he did this like massive instagram clone it also includes like crazy stuff like he has like filters in it like you could do a lot of crazy stuff with with expo yeah that's crazy like i've tried it myself and i was like oh my goodness it's gonna take a lot of time yeah check out check out this um check out this this website uh sorry this uh there's also there's also a stepbystep kind of um guide on on their blog it's a little bit outdated so i'm not sure you know i think it was from last year or something like that but there might have been newer things but check out that project it's like you want to know what you could do with with expo you can do a lot exactly yeah you can and then duke is excellent it was only two you said it does look like instagram it was only until you said that frank oh wait have you uh let me go ahead and check this out one second i was just looking at something um okay they've got a demo let me go ahead and try to share my screen i'll share with you guys also publish some blogs about uh react native on clever programmer you know like we all also guys if you're not already reading those vlogs and please check them out we really put a lot of time into it and now i'm thinking of making some content about uh you know blogs about react native i'm gonna do that very soon nice dude is this frank is this using um uh react native or is this yeah this is the it's actually really interesting this is uh the the exfol web version right so they actually have it on if you look at the repo it has like the ios and all that stuff so you could run it um this is kind of like if you if you have it on your um on your if you if you clone it and then put it on your like your own device on expo right it does it does like a bunch of stuff it's it's actually pretty nuts nice yeah oh dope dude so this is actually going to the the web sort of one yeah so they broke it out into three pieces web uh android ios um yeah see look you see like the that's the right components navigation screen and you guys check you can just pretty much look at how they like you might be wondering how do they handle permissions dive into their code you can see look there's some kind of permissions here yeah exactly so it's like you know it allows you to to say hey yes um camera permissions audio recording so then you could like record a little video like this app does quite a bit of stuff exactly yeah so you can pretty much see it here and this is to be honest like uh and you might look at this and be like oh my god it's class based but to be honest like the main thing the main thing is is that there it's showing you how to use it right it's showing you how to go ahead and and you can see they've got a bunch of things they've got some kind of gate action sheet provider audio mode connector and like all of this stuff you can then go ahead and dive into that code and check out so this is actually a really good way of um sort of like widening your breadth and knowledge when it comes to react native um but yeah i would definitely say go ahead check and check that out that looks pretty cool though dude i have a question for frank can we do some programming uh in uh for example if i'm making a video i want to program it you know you know one scene is there then i can click and i will do something but i click here i will do something there is it possible uh in a video using our react or react native or any tool well i'm not sure of your question so you like like to create like i'm i'm streaming we i'm making a streaming video right moving any more short movie okay okay when i click at a particular point during a movie so it will create it will give me an open my app something like that um something you know i think i'm sorry are you saying to record like uh like a video for that of your app working or what what am i no no no i created a movie like we are recording right now right we made this movie after completion of this movie i want to add cc into it and say here what we are talking i want to translate and script in the bottom okay how do i do that so you could you you could make programming so you could make an app right which takes some kind of video source so you can upload some kind of video file to it you could then look at um some kind of library which which could be like i would recommend searching for a library what was that i know a really good way to do this okay go for it dude yeah what you would first want to do is uh okay so create the app okay and then it maybe would ask for like um a video file or maybe a youtube link if you uploaded it to youtube then i i mean it includes like google cloud and stuff like uh if you feed it once you do it in the back end it will send that to um google cloud and then google cloud can do a transcript and then you can also use their nlp api so you can like cross check and see if it's generating the right words and then you can use like cloud translate to translate the different to get different languages and stuff yeah dude that's clever that's smart actually another thing is because my purpose is little bit different for example while um he's talking about sun is talking about react so when he's talking about react there will be a logo of react on the backhand side of it and when i click react logo it will launch uh you know something on react right so what happened what i would recommend here is is to be honest i would i would like to completely honest i would say you want to just it's more of a different approach here i would recommend rather than doing anything like that i would simplify everything and and and build up your skill set in a video editing software uh because because the truth is and then there's host it on youtube and have uh react like icons kind of moving at that point and then you can on youtube you can actually have an overlay at that timestamp where it's clickable that would be my approach if you want to do something like that um you can go ahead and custom build this stuff um so that you can have it but it's it's going to be a bigger app like you're kind of building now like a video editing kind of app which which there's no straightforward answer to you're gonna have to like break down each feature of the app build it out it's not a case of like answering if i want this to kind of like you know kind of move around here how do i do that you're gonna have to kind of work out how do you get this element on the screen how do you interact with the element do you want drag and drop features you see like there's a lot more to break down from that sort of a use case um but guys while we're all sort of like still uh we've still got some energy let's dive into expo right so we spoke a lot about expo today um so we installed expo cli so what i'm going to do is i've just cd into a directory so i'm going to go ahead and say expo init and then i'm going to say exponent i'm just going to say demo app right i'm going to do enter and this is going to go ahead and it says okay we got blank a minimal app is clean as an empty canvas we've got typescript so a bunch of typescript cool stuff happening um i think it was my last coaching call yeah my last coaching call everyone who's interested in typescript go ahead and watch that last one because we delve into a bit of typescript stuff which is pretty cool um yeah i love that yeah make sure you do then go ahead and check it out it should be uploaded um and uh it's gonna be it was pretty cool we ran through some typescript stuff so make sure you do that and then here we're going to go ahead and do um i'm going to do manage workflow blank so i'm going to click on enter and then it's going to download uh using npm to install packages and it will install some dependencies and stuff hopefully at this point everything doesn't break and it kind of goes well um but i'm going to pull up the chat while this is happening so i can see what's going on i also like uh figuring out like how my partner used firebase actually so yeah how you did like uh npmi firebase tools for react and like npm i firebase yep that that's literally what he used oh he used okay so this is a question this is the reason why i was asking this right is you can use that um there are some pros and cons to use like the rn firebase audio to help them out a bit with like some firebase functions okay right okay yeah because you can definitely yeah you can use the the remember react native is still javascript so you can actually use the javascript um sort of libraries with it but react native firebase.io whatever that url is i'm just typing react native firebase library and it'll come up on google that stuff is going to be um uh it's built they've considered other things for example when you log in wait like if you notice whenever we built a clone when you log in and you refresh the app or you kind of come back to the page it will have a sort of initial split second and then it will log you in because it has to kind of cache or check the server and it'll kind of like grab your login details and they'll kind of log you in or like you'll check if there's a cookie store and if if that cookie is signed and and not expired and then i'll log you in right now on the react native library packages there's most likely going to be a frank just dropped it in the chat as well so make sure you go check that um but in the react native one most likely it does a lot more sort of deeper level of caching or another layer of caching so you don't get that like glitchiness and it kind of works seamlessly like you would expect to do so there are reasons to use it but as um shrika showed us like you can use the the sort of regular javascript packages there's nothing wrong with that but just know that there are some differences and there are reasons why you would want to use the um the the sort of packages or libraries like the react native firebase one for example firebase only offer some stuff for example cloud messaging to native platforms which means that you're gonna have to install that kind of library anyway um otherwise you won't be able to access that a b testing remote config all that cool firebase stuff um you need to go ahead and do that so yeah also like another thing is because like uh the react native firebase that kind of like gave him a little bit more issues that's why he kind of used the yeah instead so so this is a that's actually a really good topic um and to quickly touch base on so um yeah so as freaky said like you're going to run into more of more kind of resistance when you're using the react native libraries because there's it's no longer just a simple install command you now have to do ios dependencies and something like pod in store so you have to install ios pods and stuff like that then you have to install um android and you have to mess with i think it's gradle i remember i'm quite it's been a while since i touched that yeah yeah it's like is that great or stuff yeah you're gonna have some kind of dependencies for android but you have to like cd into each one and do an install ios is definitely pod in store and things like that but then the thing is right install might work and then you go to android install and it breaks so you're gonna have to like debug the two separate things and then it comes together and then it works so it's not as quick setting it up but remember a lot of people have put like a lot of love and soul into into these libraries and uh and they work and and huge teams have come together to make it work and they've ironed out a lot of the problems so i would recommend using it but if you run into a situation where you can't use it for whatever reason you can't you've been debugging for ages the first thing i'll say is find a mentor that you can kind of jump to don't quit but the second thing is don't let that be a blocker like like for example shriek is a perfect example he didn't let it block him he had a time frame imagine if you have a client and they they're willing to pay you money or and it's a case of you're going to lose that client if you don't learn that job i would pretty much say just use whatever you can use and slowly slowly you will get better with that step with that tech stack but you're going to lose the opportunity if you don't do anything all right so i would say make it work and then yes like i guarantee like i look back at old code now and i'm like god damn it why did i do that why did i like that's a terrible way of doing it um but you're the only way you're gonna learn it's the only way that you're actually gonna progress is the only way that you're actually gonna go ahead and um and and do that right um oh frank i sent you a dm on slack you said frankie diem on slack yeah yeah uh quick question about the architecture of the reg native do we use um do you use recruiter for on rec native or does it have a different way of like changing from page to page um so you don't use react router on on react native use react native navigation and there's also there's like a battle of which best navigation library to use but i remember we switched our previous workplace from one of the popular ones to react native navigation and then that picked up quite a lot so a lot of people use react native navigation um there are a few it's good to know those good question there are a few different uh navigation libraries whereas with the react uh js so react.js meaning uh the sort of web stuff that's going to be pretty much react each time so recruiter is a lot more sort of in the lead on that front but um or you'll have something like next js um and that's going to be a bit different you know yeah sunny sunday we should cover next year's yeah we should we should definitely do maybe like some server side sort of stuff because that's a whole other way of thinking server side rendering it it can really it can throw you off a bit like it can be a bit kind of confusing and i was like oh my what all do i have to do i was like okay let's just get back to basics of react yeah exactly when we go and uh for any work like that you know they need a lot of things together and it is very difficult to remember each and everything expect in in an interviews so how do you prepare your preparings only based on the questions or you do do you prepare yourself you know one at a time like if you are going it means i have a two skills like react and angular both right then it is very difficult for me to grasp both so remember firstly the chances are yeah the chance i wouldn't want i wouldn't try and master react in angular because you're kind of conflicting two different libraries like as in i would i would focus on like because you're okay put it this way if even if you did do really good with both imagine what you would do if putting all your effort to one right and and i'd recommend react because of the market demand and things like that now what you want to do is you want to change your mindset and approach to the situation as opposed to the way you're looking at it right now which is um you know like there's so much to learn like isn't there so much what do i go into the interview with and things like that like remember we we want to move away from this theory mindset right of like you know like i need to know this i need to know this i need to know that move away from that and instead get practical handson experience right get practical handson yeah and and sort of run into the debugging situations yourself realize okay i needed react router to to overcome pagering and things like that i needed i ran into a state management problem at which point redux was the answer and redux allowed me to solve this problem now what happens is you have a wide breadth of knowledge which is which has been ingrained so deep because that debugging session lasted six hours when you had to figure it out right and then whereas if you read it simply in a medium article yeah sure you might have understood it in that one hour but i can guarantee debugging it for six to eight hours or something like that or a week sometimes it's taken me a week to sort of overcome some problems before um and i tell you i never forget that that week and what i learned because the pain and the sort of you know doubting yourself and all the sort of trauma that it gives you um that stuff is what really like that you really learn right like it's just like if you're riding a bike and you trip up on the bike and you really like break your leg i can guarantee you're going to ride your bike a little bit better from that moment on so you don't do the same thing right and you're never going to forget that so it's the same with coding like you really just and i would say take it with that approach and you'll be very much more susceptible to answering questions um that get thrown at you and remember like frank said if you don't know the answer to a question it's only honestly better to say like look i don't know the answer to that but show that you're openminded so that you can kind of approach it differently or try and like readjust the question and be like okay but maybe were you talking about like state management so say somebody asked a question about redux and you had no idea about what redux is then you could be like okay i haven't actually used redux but um but but you're talking about state management within an app right and then they can then you can kind of like direct the conversation around that and then you can be like okay so yeah and then you might have used something else so i actually had this question from me and i had i hadn't used redux but i had used something called flux uh and i redirected the question to flux instead and i was like yeah so i would actually do that um and i would and and i'm happy to learn redux and pick it up if it's what is used in this situation yeah play play to your strengths especially like if you're kind of just getting started it's this is what everybody and this call needs to understand it is a rare day that that someone asks you something extremely advanced for a position that's you know getting started right react is kind of new it's like it's been around it's been battle tested but it's still kind of new so don't don't like worry about like what the recruiters are telling you or like the hr people are telling you like oh you need to have 20 years of react it's like what are you talking about it doesn't exist right so try to get past the people that are the gatekeepers that are saying like you need 20 years of react and say hey i'm really really strong here's my beautiful portfolio here's my amazing like you know my my amazing uh resume that frank helped me with like this is this is gonna look amazing and then it you start getting past the people that are like the gatekeepers and then you get to the person who who was like interviewing and then when you're there with the interviewer and say hey like are you gonna make me invert a binary tree to change like the color of a button like this just be real this is like this is this can't you know it has to match like if you're if you're only offering like you know like a more entrylevel kind of like salary it's like don't expect me to invert binary trees and no you know be like one of the core contributors of you know redux because that doesn't match up because i understand that like in the beginning um it's more forgiving but always be really persistent because like sometimes the gatekeepers which is like the human resource folks or the recruiters and stuff like that they don't know anything about programming yeah they 100 don't so they're looking for all these like keywords inside your resume i know how to mess with those algorithms to put the keywords in who cares if you know it or not right get to the person who is the person that you want to talk to and have a strong portfolio strong resume and that'll get you to to to that that place that you're talking you guys are talking about exactly that's right that's golden man because honestly then this is a real truthful point is if you imagine you're not surrounded by anyone or any developer community or any sort of mentor right now imagine if a recruiter's job is to land you in a position because they get commission on a perm every time someone lands a job right so if angular is hot right now even if react is what you should be learning if angular is hot they're going to push you to angular they're going to be like um they're like you need to know angler you need to know this this this you need to know uh sas sas is really important to know sas um and they're just kind of they're like frank says it's all buzz words they just they have no idea how to use this stuff they kind of just like yeah this is this this and then i'm telling you they literally list out things and it's quite funny now like if i jump on a call with a recruiter and hearing them trying to sell me on a react job because they were they're telling me like you need to know this you know you need to know this you need to know this and i'm like oh yeah okay cool cool like i'm just really busy right now i kind of need to go um but the point is is that this is so true like i've seen i've seen up work like um client proposals and all they actually need is just like in a basic html css website and some people are so stubborn about react they'll be like you need to implement react you just need to implement read without any reason at all yeah i haven't played any beginner programming but also do the same project but they will also always make him you know like you need to learn yet and those things i i i don't i never liked those kinds trust me yeah and then the thing you want to be careful about with that is is that you don't want the recruiter to to be the one directing you about what you need to learn or not right because remember they might be telling like as in a recruiter might literally come up to you and say um yeah like uh um like you you'll be you're using react and and yeah you don't want to be like this is a hypothetical for example but they might be like yeah don't touch firebase yeah five nobody uses firebase everyone's using sql server yeah you know don't do that and because you you're not surrounded by a developer community you're not surrounded by anyone you wouldn't know otherwise you'd be like well they're the ones that are landing the jobs they they know right so now you've just lost out on learning about an amazing tour like firebase which will actually be booming trust me in the future like that it has a future ahead of it um and also like firebase it would have sort of talked you towards the nosql route and so you would have picked up no sequel on that journey and it's a fun way to learn it so you would have gone in really easy with little resistance but if you listen to the recruiter then you would have been kind of tempted to go the other way and now your time isn't as well spent and it's also a case of but the ques the main thing is right is that how do you avoid this one surround yourself with the community because then you can quickly validate if it's true or not right you can come to the community and say hey guys like where is it did anyone land a job okay okay what what what like what have you found that you need in that job pretty much and you can kind of you know validate the answer and kind of find out the truth and right now in this if you could ask us right now like what do you think i should learn and i would tell you like like we said build out the clones build out the sort of breakdown the clones what did they consist of you'll start to see the patterns yourself that's going to be the real interesting sort of like that's going to be the sort of golden nugget i'd like to refer to them as and that's going to be the one that's going to land you that position and then forget all the other buzzwords because web development is so trendy that like honestly one thing could come into come into trend tomorrow and then and and everyone's on it and then something else will change and everyone's on that and but the one thing i'll tell you is react is here to stay like as in reactors definitely here to stay it will last here for for a substantial number of years and by that point whatever's next it will be pretty easy to probably transition into it based on the things you pick up with react so that would be my advice towards towards handling all that stuff one thing has happened with me when i was you know verizon was interviewing me uh for a position where this is the major skill set is uh um react and javascript and css these are the you know required screen set but angular was there too and they spent an hour with me in uh javascript yep and um react okay but now they came you know there was a third person who was in good in angular now when he comes to the angular then means i started but i was blank out because it's it's just too much for me to uh give each and every aspect of the questions so even if i tell a little bit tell me more about it but my my brain freezes after some time you know it is very difficult to go back into the programming of angular and then give them a practical usage of angular to be honest what what you've probably experienced there is more of an edge case like if you've gone for a job bro and the job is react um it would either yeah if it would be react then i would if they're using react for one thing angler for another thing i mean in most cases it would typically just stay as react you wouldn't get react and angular in that job right and if and if you do i'd kind of asked him i'd be like well what are you guys doing here like it's like how it's like are you guys attempting to migrate an old angular app and to react that's that's a common thing yeah that's right it's like it's like they're they're the people who know react really well and know angular really well are like i couple dozen people that i know personally and so it's like and those people charge so much for it that it's almost like that's a very specialized kind of use case again like this is all about asking questions like hey guys why in the hell do you have angular and react in one in one interview and also are you going to ask them to invert binary trees to change your your your button colors yeah right so you have to you have to ask them like oh what what would what's the purpose of this is this like an internal tool are you guys migrating from angular to react right like try to because then it's like then they're like okay this person is asking questions that are relevant to what we do it's like ah yeah we have like this old angular app we're trying to get to react because every other part of the enterprise is upgrading it you know we our back end is is this but you know we need some help doing that it's like okay now i know that it's not an angular interview it's like a migration interview it's like well this is kind of how i would approach it i would start encapsulating these functions right this function and then and then to convert that to a functional component and react right it changes the conversation but it makes you it puts you into their mindset of like why they would have such different such different like things inside of one inside of one um they said they acquired couple of the companies that's exactly the number yeah and they want to maintain rising and they buy exactly they buy a lot of crap so it's like yes that's exactly it's migration they said it is a not a migration they said initially you have to add bustle and this is here and there so one time you are in this project okay so it's it's basically what they call it's like it's called the scoop out like this happens a lot of startups they'll buy it whatever technology is currently there they support it for a little bit longer until they know what it does and then they scoop it out yep they take the best parts of it and they scoop it out and it's okay again like that conversation you have with the verizon people if you know this kind of stuff and you talk to people like me that are more senior we kind of know what's going on then then it becomes like you become a better like you become more valuable to them and it's like maybe right now you weren't able to do the angular and the react stuff but maybe you could you know pick up some books or something on or some some some ideas of how to migrate an angular app right so you become better and better and it's okay to go back there in six months and say hey guys you know i know that this position was still there i was thinking about it like here's here just a little quick email and i guarantee you they will probably still have that piece of software there yeah and it was amazing they said can we club the two applications together banana angler and another i'd say absolutely it's uh 200 us dollars per hour yeah exactly we could do anything yeah that means it's uh too much what they ask me of course a tool because again because they don't they don't know it well like yeah they're trying to get they're trying to do the best they can like we have this legacy app that is kind of not fitting into our thing we want to make it we want to make it better i said i told them that there is another tool which is essential which is an extgs then i have to learn that too much is together but without that i can't but i have to learn it what i would say at all is is for the sort of in terms of what you're going to get back in terms of like what you can do now as an actionable point i would say in this case i would say like like frank said there's a there's a small number of people who are really really uh sort of specialized with react and angular right and if they are the chances are that of them being up to date with both is going to be even lower right so they're going to they will either be like they'll know how to transfer one from another now what i would say is if in the case of going ahead and and in that job situation even even i even if they came to me and said like hey something like would you would you mind like migrating this angler app to this reactor to be honest i probably wouldn't take the job like i'd kind of like look elsewhere but there's plenty of jobs out there i'll probably go ahead and i'm i'm more focused on being react specialized as opposed to react and angular and the jackofalltrades right because i know that if i'm really good with react i can charge a premium for that right like i can i can go ahead and i can be like you can charge quite a good uh rate for that as well but like frank said the more there's like a niche specialized area you can charge an immense amount because there's less people but that means there's less opportunity because it's also a niche right which means that like so in terms of what you want to do now i would say spend your time investing into sort of react front and development uh fight find your feet with that stuff first and then kind of move into building a back end um so a lot of the clones we do back in builds then you'll kind of cover a full stack ground have loads of stuff on your portfolio and then push for the react jobs i'd say all full stack jobs i'd say go that route um it's going to benefit you long term it's going to mean that you're you you're going to build some kind of security for the long term as well because imagine angular suddenly dies tomorrow and you've spent all these months um going ahead and learning both and react took over now you've just suddenly wasted not wasted but you pretty much you've lost a lot of time where if you had just drove through one route it's like trying to say i'm going to be the best basketball player the best football player the best tennis player the best cricketer yeah you're never going to be the best on one of them and you're probably not going to be hired by the best team whereas if you're just like i'm going to be the best football i'm going to put every ounce of my effort into that you're probably going to get picked up by a premier league team and you're going to get paid big bucks right and that's going to be the difference between that kind of lifestyle and the guy who's trying to like accomplish everything is immensely different right so you can have immense differences with that yeah and also and also remember the the prime focus for companies is to get as much value as they can from productivity of a developer right so it's like sometimes they'll say really weird stuff just to try to push you in one direction or another direction and it's it might not you have to decide what's good for you not not what's best for the company right because like like you know what sunny was saying is that you could be the best angular person in the world and then angular is not as useful anywhere there's far less jobs so it's like you kind of like limiting yourself versus like focusing on like a more junior kind of react developer position that has more more upside to grow like we've just showed you examples of just all in react you could do uh an amazing web app which i you know i've showed sony this i i made a dashboard for for sonos and then i also i'm building the app for them all this is all together it's all the same code base it's all react so it's like imagine how imagine as a developer how infinitely more productive i am to to them by being able to do those kinds of things versus like if you know if they needed a angular front end and they had to switch to the react native and it's it's all over the place and it's like it's not good to it's hard to switch that context when you're in the middle of like coding yeah it's it's a real pain and it's very hard to do so you're less productive so yeah try to see like try to try to get hired by someone who wants to grow you grow with you in a certain direction don't like whatever they're saying it's like you have to be yet because you have to do the hard work yourself right so you have to be motivated and if you're just if you're just updating an old angular app and trying to do pieces together with sencha and all that stuff you're saying like that's a nightmare it's not fun exactly and the point for a while having that that back and forth decision and usually what they'll try and do is that they'll kind of like either a they'll give up or or b they'll they'll throw a salary up and they'll be like all right yeah we'll pay you x amount don't let that salary determine your decision right because trust me it might seem like oh like this is paying me so much more than than all the other sort of react jobs i'm being offered to at the level i'm at right now but remember it's about like frank said like you're you're going to be infinitely productive if you choose to react real and it's and it's here to stay it's got like a future ahead of it now you've also got the freelancing the coaching that the fulltime jobs you can make a ton of money going in that route whereas this other that you might do yeah sure you're going to get like an extra 10k maybe in salary or something like that but you're going to be limited you're also going to be niched so you're kind of like you're literally putting a box around your skill set as opposed to what you can offer at that point in time whereas if you put the time into dedicated to building out your react skills you're going to be a lot more valuable to a lot more people and that book in its in return will like remember value is what you want to focus on money is the lagging indicator it will come you just focus on your money uh your your value and and everything else kind of follows with it yeah and also imagine the kind of teams that they would have right like you're going to look to your left and to your right and they're not going to teach you react because maybe they're just in you know in in you know some other kind of like more enterprise role which is okay if you want to do enterprise development stuff but it's you might not like i learned the most from other people i work with like i'm working with the team at sonos and they're doing some incredible just crazy just you know top secret ai music stuff like it's incredible but i'm learning from them right and it's like just when you think you can't learn enough or more stuff it's like i'm i'm making a react native app for something that i've been doing for years at this point i've made a lot of apps for movie studios and all this kind of video heavy stuff but i've never done a music thing and i was like okay i guess this is my music thing and okay they let me do it react native somehow i convinced them after showing them sonny's thing right it's like and but i'm but i'm growing as a developer right like i'm not i'm not i'm not stuck in like oh this has to be kind of coded in you know jquery html page right like that's not where you want to be it's like oh like you know i'm i'm growing this way i want to take the company on that journey with me so that more people can help contribute to this code because like once once this is completed all of the other people that are there can learn a lot from this like this app exactly it's like you know once you start seeing how it works and everything like that that's that's what you want to do you want to think about your your future not like their future yeah they don't care because they don't care about you anyways so it's like it's true yeah i haven't focused on react now because it is very hard for me to one in two comes in a react another comes into a uh angler it was very hard for me yeah because i prepared they give only two three days another because i am struggling for the job if we take if we take that if we take that mindset then someone else is going to come with c plus plus and you'll be like ah now i'm going to study c plus plus some somebody comes to java now i'm going to take java i'm going to be uh the best copo programmer in the world yeah the most important things when you're doing freelancing and all that kind of stuff is also it's always going to be saying no right if you're not good at something and if you if you think that you know it's not right for you like trust me i won't i won't ever you know if a client approaches me for a very good sum of money say that a hundred thousand dollars your job for c plus plus right well i wouldn't do it because that's not where i want to go right so saying no is quite quite important and learning to say you know and taking no for an answer is also very important right yeah sometimes it happens that you try your best and you you're not able to you know land that job it's okay like you can just try it again but and also sometimes you have to say no to a client that's approaching you and yeah it has happened with me too like one of one of my clients was about machine learning right it was happening really really recently and i told him frankly that you know i'm not into machine learning and all that kind of stuff so i don't mean that i'll be ideal for you yeah i agree that's another thing everybody wants machine learning yeah everybody wants machine learning you'll see ai it's like wait wait you want machine learning for what oh so you can change this one button and make it blue yeah you guys don't understand like how crazy it is out there because there's such a huge disconnect between the people that build the stuff and the people that are kind of on the business side yeah like the business guys are like hey we gotta make this thing machine learning we gotta do this and that's like for whatever you don't want to complicate it ever like you don't even need to overcomplicate it like machine learning all in terms of yes yes it does apply sometimes but you know it's it's not at all necessary for you to you know like always include machine learning and whatever you're doing i include it in everything now because i just like firebase machine exactly yeah and yeah most of the time the the the use case remember like like there is a disconnect with the two things and you're going to find a situation where somebody might say yeah we want to know machine learning to figure out how many users prefer the red button against the blue button you're like no dude that's called a b testing and and you see like and then it kind of comes down to that and then and then they'll be like oh oh well yeah yeah i want that and then you'll be like yeah i know how to do that and then they'll be like oh okay like that that kind of thing quickly builds the trust in the conversation like that's because firebase does it it's like look it up on facebook yeah whatever firebase supports i am an expert yeah google optimize is good yeah you know like uh suggest some technologies or something to the client and say that yes this might be the better way to do it you know if they're if they're going in the romney and if you show them that you care uh that actually brings up a lot about you talk it does a lot about you and it it makes an entire professional kind of thing right so this is again something that i learned from soft skills so if you're if you get an opportunity to you know improve on some technology or you know if you think that this technology might not be the correct one for the entire job then you can suggest that the client and sometimes the client accepts it sometimes they they don't but at least you try it right so it shows that you're professionally cared exactly exactly guys i did make a machine learning app that does optical recognition so i was like machine learning on the resume nice dude we're actually going to touch on a lot of machine learning stuff once we get into um react native builds and things like that so yeah like there's a lot of like libraries that we can use are going to be really really really handy um so we're going to talk about it does come with a lot of machine learning libraries many people underrate the power of javascript and machine learning some people are always like python but javascript also has tensorflow.js so it's quite it's quite powerful over there too yeah like tensorflow is very powerful um and what you can do with it is actually quite simple like i looked into tensorflow and python once and i i wasn't able to you know find some kind of like big problem in it it's quite simple to learn too yeah exactly it's quite simple to learn and it's going to be super super helpful yeah you know um you could build applications where like say you can build something in react native and then you can have like a powerful machine learning ai in python and just create endpoints and api calls and then connect it into your own application yeah i really would use javascript in that case like personally like javascript and python are quite similar if you're if you think about the syntax like uh deep down of course python is integrated in javascript it's compiled but the thing is that uh you know i don't really think that it's it's quite useful to include two languages when you can easily do the same thing with just one language so why include why like you know boost the complexity and why not just stick to one language exactly and uh to add on to what nathan was saying like yeah like a lot of the time like guys there's services out there that do this sort of like the heavy lifting for us and we just tap in right like we tap into it and we kind of get the benefit of machine learning without doing it it's like the same thing like it's it's just at different levels right like if again it goes back and go going back to date picker example if you have um like you wouldn't rewrite the library to have a date picker right like i wouldn't spend all that time to go ahead and do that i would just go ahead and it's it's crazy hard to make a date yeah it is i had to do one dude it's crazy very tough and yeah it requires a lot of uh you know knowledge how it will navigate yeah there's a lot of headache with it a lot of headache with her um guys how you can handle uh notification via email in um and react we will touch that we'll we'll touch base on it and in another session but you can use plenty of things like sendgrid uh twilio there's a lot of different services you can use expo has that feature also oh nice oh we could yeah i didn't know that oh nice yeah can you send a link for that oh like if you go to expo look at like the it has it has um like the gyroscope all the other functionalities i come with typical app development they're all available yeah all right all right let's npm run ios yeah let's do it all right so now you want to go ahead and do mpm start all right that was suspense guys it's the holy now mpm start and then you get this you get a metro bundler right so this is the first thing you want to kind of get familiar with and wow that's a big qr code and terminal um so what you want to do is once you get this thank you so much oliver says you are the freaking best sunny on youtube appreciate that dude and um what we want to do now is we have um this this terminal come up and this is a good starting point so you can hit i for ios simulator w for run on web i'm going to hit w to run it on the web just to quickly sort of test this it says attempting to open the project in a web browser so we can now go ahead and watch this pop up so it will go ahead and it it'll do a bunch of bundling browser what was that you could also just click run in web browser like yeah so on here you can do it here as well so you can take one web browser run an ios one on android or you it depends like because the reason why i like to show that one is because sometimes you have it open in vs code and you want to control it in vs code um without going back so this is a handy way but yeah you can definitely do that um so now what you want to do is go ahead and i'm just going to do command d to split my oh god damn i hate doing oh man what have i done how do i get rid of the split is it there we go yeah so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to open up a second tab i'm going to go into the same directory so i'm in here right now i'm going to do code insiders because i've got the inside this edition i'm going to open up vs code right so give it a sec and this will pop up okay now we're we're all familiar with vs code we uh if you're not then just go ahead and check out some of the clones but the first thing i want to do is go to extensions over here type in es and then i want to type in this one here so es7 react redux graphql react native snippets right so go make sure you download this one because it's really really handy it's kind of very very understood this one right yeah do you want to show them how to add the code thing to pass yeah yeah so let's show them that as well yeah so that's good so here you want to go to um so let's just close this for a sec so to get that little trick that i just showed you right so this one here so for you guys it would just be code spaced um and then and dot unless you do the code insiders which is like the beta sort of vs code um we're going to do command shift p and this will open this like a kind of selection thing right command shift p and then you want to type in um shell right and then you see install code command in path uh mine says code insiders if you do the code insiders you can get this and then there is a way of aliasing code insiders to code which i usually do i've just been lazy on this computer and i haven't done it um so you can pretty much go ahead and do that and then what that will allow you to do is when you've got a uh when you're inside a directory you can just do code insiders or code and then space dot which means the current directory and it will open up your entire workspace so if you notice if i do ls to list all the files if i do ls to list all the files you can see app.js app.json uh what was that sorry um don't forget the door time i i said so that yeah it's quite important yeah you don't want to forget that doc because this guy exactly it's going to be an important step and now what you want to do is you can have this open so i like to again download a few things oh my zsh is one thing for the sort of nice looking terminals which tells you you'll get branch and things like that it's really nice uh i always do that on a fresh computer then the second one i would say download is spectacle um the reason why i love spectacles so much and i kind of talk about it load this honestly it's just it has like i remember when kazi first told me about it i kind of overlooked it but when you have things like this you do i do command option f boom uh do this and i kind of and even if i want to do like a threequarter split um i can do that so you see it's very quick to go ahead and resize my screens and then i can have multiple desktops for if i want like sometimes if i'm coding um i this is so in case you're curious as to how my flow is right i have a big screen above me right now so you don't need to have a second screen but i have a laptop here and then i have a second big monitor in front of me so i have an ultra wide and then but what i would say is even if you don't i didn't have an ultrawide when i started i just had a second screen you can pretty much go ahead and if you don't have a second screen so i'm going to start with one screen then what i recommend is make get really good at using um multiple desktops like this so you see i'm just literally swiping between them or mac um windows has a similar functionality and what i would do is the arrow key for windows with control windows exactly yeah so control win and then the arrow key and then you'll be able to go through them so what i would do is i'll typically have some kind of like a browser over on this side and then i'll have my code editor on this side little and a little sort of um viewpoint over on this side okay so this is going to be um a really quick way to sort of code and or you can kind of mix and match so i've had it where i've had the full code thing and then i would have the sort of app running here um but again it comes down to preference right so now we're going to click on app.js and you can see here i can see my app so i can see open up app.js to start working on your app so now if i go ahead and type in like one two three one two three popup react all right and then save you can see there you go hot reloading so we get the hot reloading and this is the app working and and everything's good so now quick few things to notice again very similar outcome right so very similar to our react apps we just have a functional component so if we was going to make this i'm going to create a new component and show you how just how similar it is to a react app right so let's go ahead and create a sort of let's call it um what should we call it what should we call like a new component should we just call it maybe a uh a profile right so a profile dot um um let's just call it a row right we have a row oh god this is the thing when coding you kind of get blank i'm going to go for profile profile.js right and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to use the snippets but i'm going to so typically what we were doing before was we didn't we're saying rfce and that was a react functional component exported right which which does this now this does a react functional component but in in the react js which is the web one right and the reason why we know it's web is because it says div and and so forth we don't want this one instead we want the rn for react native and then you do f and then you can actually go ahead and do i think it's just e r and f e right and then i'm not sure what s is s oh yeah s is with the style sheet yeah so with e by itself is the default profile and it will go ahead and stay up for you and uh e s is with a style sheet so i'll do it with the style sheet if i was you because it sets up everything that you kind of need and you see it does all the imports and it goes ahead and sets up your first little section here so let's make this take props and i'm going to destructure the props and say okay it has some some text for the profile so let's go ahead and just render that text here and what i'm going to do is know about this extension called kite i think it's available and it's quite powerful it's an ai extension it's not just for it's actually you need to install it and set it up don't do it right now but uh yeah it's it's very very handy like i use it all the time and trust me i find it so valuable oh yeah oh nice dude yeah like it's so it's like an entirely auto complete engine so the autocomplete of vs code isn't that good and once you start with kite right you just have to type dot and it um shows up not from the popularity but from the recommendation from the ai itself so it's very very handy and yeah actually they actually imported like millions of lines of code from github and then based it on like how many stars that github thing had and so you're basically pulling code in from like someone's amazing library oh really nice there is actually one more thing to it and that surprised me a lot so you you always find yourself you know looking up for documentation right guess what this comes with inbuilt copilot mode so you can actually have your documentation on the side and then whenever you you can just search for a term and it can act as a search engine it's quite powerful yeah that's dope dude so i've installed it now uh let's go ahead and use it so what's the simplest way you gotta install on your computer oh hi oh damn okay so there's actually an engine let's do it right now let's just go ahead and let's do it um let's do it so kite is downloading so it's got two minutes it's downloading so hopefully it doesn't jit up the screen a stream um but what we can do now is uh that's cool because i actually i read this in the newsletter ages ago um because i recognized this uh sort of logo but they advertise a lot in the newsletters yeah i saw ages going i kind of just you know when you read something and videos are sponsored by kite and like literally all of them are sponsored by kite yeah oh man i mean they have ai they have real ai really yeah yeah exactly yeah so that's going to be pretty good for them um so now github.com exactly and so now it's downloading it's got 29 seconds left okay so we should be able to see this in a sec um so i need to go ahead and just install that and then start okay cool we'll give that a go and then what happens is what as i'm typing it's going to just prompt me with auto completes yeah when you're very dot uh then you will find a lot of auto complete so if you ever need something like autocomplete then of course it's gonna be there and it's quite powerful again but does it break my emmett no i don't i don't i don't think so it doesn't break your emit when you're using html it doesn't break your limit but i use python heavily and in python you know there is a library called the os library you deal with a lot of operating system stuff yeah and over there like you can write the entire for loop it will write everything for you and the entire follow will be written to you just by just using a few dot and stuff like that it's very powerful nice okay let's do it so i've installed it i'm gonna run kite um so again if you guys aren't using alfred you should be using alfred as well because alfred is a game changer yeah alfred is a game changer and you want to make sure you enable so if you go to alfred um i'm going to go ahead we're talking about a lot of extensions over here yeah i know i got quite a few so here request permission blah blah blah okay yep um oh god this is anything requires so many okay so uh let me go ahead and quickly sign up to this and because we can if this is a tool that will help everyone out for sure dude let's go ahead and show this i'm going to quickly can you go live streams too like sometimes you know you have to die yeah with it you don't really need to do all that so again it's a very handy tool sponsor what's up exactly yeah sponsored by kai that sounded legit dude for the very very best ml completion very smooth code that's it so this is gonna okay so kite copilot is installed it's installing of them okay i'm definitely not using them right now um and then it's very very hectic i i used it once i regret it yeah i've used vim before yeah i only use it when i have to use it in a server situation navigation is quite useful with them the key wirings are epic yeah of course you won't find them anywhere else but vs code is just 7d so i use anything else nice okay so now i've got it installed um what's how's what's the next step now um i think that in your vs code you should get a symbol of kite uh below in the in the um okay so oh okay see uh i think it said you need to restart vs code as well somewhere so i think you do okay so now we've we've done that and then we can see welcome to kai hey there we go let's go let's check this out some developer has taken years to add this um uh this little design in so let's see what they've done what they've done here mike's now my spectacle's not working good now okay something is glitching up okay there we go okay uh lintel. okay so now so not writing python do i need to do i need to do that or do not put it open to the respondent javascript okay that's a tutorial cool code completions right so if you ever edit a configure to show the kite will show your computer's automatically as you type okay which we already have on and then import j things like that control space if all completions aren't on yes i already have all completions on so if we do like one oh sick okay so it's already starting to pop up and then if i do control space oh no oops you get this report types from but it would learn right as i'm as i uh yeah yeah as you as you commit stuff locally it looks through like your local kind of github right so there is one concern regarding kite it does send some of your code up into the cloud for analysis like you said no right now they mention it yeah so this was a thing i used it like eight or nine months ago they might have updated it but this was the main concern why kite was not used because on a professional level you are not allowed to send the code yeah if they have fixed it i don't think so there is a better solution yeah so now it says does not send your code or any byproducts uh to the cloud i i read the entire thing that's why i even talked about it and i wouldn't have talked about it because i was reading through it and i found it very useful personally nice dude yeah i mean let's give it a go now so i guess like we'll just see it pop up more um as it comes up and then i guess if you do and you can actually you see the coupe and the coop is quite useful okay so copilot is here so this thing and now whenever you're stuck anywhere you can just search for the term and yeah it will just bring you bring it to you it's amazing which means if i do like import right yeah i mean i mean i think the auto completion will be the main sort of um benefit yeah of course you're gonna use auto completion here yeah and it's gonna make life so much easier at least it made it easier for me because i use a lot of python yeah and um it picked up the bam convention stuff for me oh really yeah it was like i was like i didn't add that so there's not really auto completion for bam stuff so oh i love that dude yeah yeah okay like if there's like linting on your ben stuff like it's it it kind of learns stuff it's pretty cool nice okay so if say if we go ahead and install profile um import profile sorry so import profile from profile and then let's go ahead and add text and then say like a profile is where the text will say like hello world oh well let's just say ssssanga profile okay now we should see this pop up okay so we have one profile two profile three profile and then let's just say we have clever karsi let's just say test one two three okay save and now you can see like okay so we've got this is literally react uh react native still guys like as in just to show you it really doesn't change like so we're actually coding in in react here so it's just very simple same thing principles the same uh notice how the styling is a little bit different so you have this style stop container and then you apply these kind of styles right so it's no longer the typical sort of css styles are getting applied instead what we can do is you can have it like this so imagine like the styles for this container right now the background color is white right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to change the background color to let's just go ahead and say like red for example and then you should see everything goes red in the background right and then if you want to change the color of the text i can go ahead and say color and i can say white and then i can do boom and that oh oops um this is the container so um color text swipe what we might have to do here is say instead i might have to actually give this a style and say let's go ahead and say styles dot uh just this is a very generic say text and here i can say text like i say color oh damn look at that dude oh nice okay this is going to make me jack man okay good times yeah you're probably the best the best from kid oh my god dude let you guys watch me build clones off the clones and you didn't want one nobody mentioned the kind of twitter i know right i need to upload like all of those clones to kai and it will pick up my kind of staho now priyanji i really thank you for for shouting that one because um that's that would be pretty cool i think it would definitely like even there the use case there was very like pretty quick yeah i just found a lot of value from it and i just wanted to share it with you guys and if you if you also use it in the live stream that would be very happy because personally it brought a lot of value to me as a python developer at least and um yeah i think that it supports like 16 to 18 languages right and uh so if you're in c sharp c plus plus all of that kind of stuff even in java i think sunny has already programmed in java so uh yeah it it does support all that you think about it you're typing in print hello world in javascript and no longer you have to type in the entire thing yeah and that will be so phenomenal that's cool that's cool like there's there's a few snippets i i've kind of come to i never write console.log every like i i always let you clg like that's just the kind of like small little tricks and stuff like that but i know in in this case now you're gonna have this kind of jacked console logo i guess like with which is going to come like all complete i mean it's cool man i think anything that can speed up your workflow i know a lot of people are a fan of the brackets uh bro i think it's what is it called color bracket bracketizer or something i personally don't like it i just like to do this i think it's a bit too much on the screen um but again like it's all down to preference but kite seems like it's it would be cool so that would be pretty we'll see how that goes um but yeah so we have this right here right now i'm going to quickly go ahead and add on something like react navigation to this and i can show you guys all right uh sunny i have a quick question for you yeah uh maybe a friend can answer um this style part okay uh the css art yep do we have to have the same file for the react native or are good can we do the same way as we were doing for the react yeah good question so what what we tend to do with this so you don't want to actually have it always in the same you can have it in the same there's nothing wrong with that um and it would sort of reduce the complexity if it's a small component you could have it in the same but a lot of people do have a convention for this and it's like app.style.js or app.styles is it styles no is it um there's a convention for this it's um i'm sure it's app.styles.js app.styles.js unless there's a different one let me quickly just double check app.styles.js there is a there is a convention for it that i've typically followed um styles dot app no it's not style style does anyone know um they're sort of i've used it before but in this case but say we had this right app.style.js or something what we could do is we can go ahead and do this and paste it here oops paste it here and now what i could do is i could just go ahead and and you can either you can do it a few ways right you can even do export default right here export default um styles like this and that can be very clean and simple and then you can go ahead and say import styles from import styles from app.styles.js then you can go ahead and get rid of this and now you've got the same sort of structure that we were used to before and you can see here it's freaking out so stylesheet.create is not a function oh yeah because we need the it should be stylesheet yeah with css um did i do no that's good good so here we go to we need we just need to import stylesheet from react native oh yeah and then we should come back and it says stars is not defined okay so let's go ahead and check out why so that is in app.js9 um styles oh yeah because we've got cap os so we're going to do lowercase s uh to be honest i mean it's all down to your standards but we it says we keep it located just for a demo you can see that works right so in that case now we've got the same similar layout with some kind of styles file and a simple import so you can do this as well right um what is the best practices for using a style sheet here uh in a module itself in a component or outside um so it depends really um remember like this is a very simple app if you add a folder structure so i've seen loads of different photo structures i've had components very simple that ones where you have a folder with just components and you have another photo with pages and you can split your app up into that i've also seen in tesco they had molecules and atoms um so molecules are like atoms are the absolute smallest components so imagine you had a component called like a profile picture yeah imagine like you had profile picture.js right and then a molecule could have been the profile.js which was the entire profile which consisted of multiple atoms you see and then you see why it kind of makes sense when you call atoms versus molecule um and then like to you so there's loads of different like standards that people use the main thing i would say is kind of have it as as a very standard base have a component a components folder have a pages folder now pages is for going to be a navigation different pages in your app have a components for the for the reusable components inside of your app right so you can have like the login page inside of the pages com inside the pages folder and so forth i'm not going to do that today because it's going to get a bit nested but the point is is anything which keeps it very like neat and to be honest what i would recommend is like frank said before go ahead and check out other people's code see how they've done it see if you can notice remember pattern recognition if you start seeing a few patterns remember this stuff evolves it's never just like this one size fits all uh and it's also very opinionated um it can change like uh app.styles.js might be the way now but it could completely change and there could be a much better way of doing it tomorrow and i think like for example if i have a team of 10 people right now i'm gonna go to sleep then which approach will be good quite late over here yeah sonny i gotta i gotta head to a meeting but anybody can hit me up anytime on slack and i i got a couple messages and happy to help anybody in the community so amazing thank you frank and thank you both of you guys were awesome in this call and and again everyone connected yeah right um okay let me quickly pull up my chat as well because i can't really see my chat as well now okay so there we go so okay so what we're going to do now is we've pretty much talked about that we've got the our first sort of react native app up and running right so we saw the differences between um like you see still functional component if i wanted to stay in this app i would pretty much go ahead and do this i would say const or i would actually just use my snippet so i'll say use state and boom i'll get this and it'll kind of give me the template for it and i'll say the name of the state so let's imagine if i had like a name piece of state and then this set name is the convention and then use state and i'd say the the name here would be like for example just to say sunny was my the default name right and then if i had the text for the first one was that piece of state so imagine we had name okay now uh imagine we sort of have this um okay so it's freaking out because use state isn't imported so we need to go ahead and import that from react so you see them the kind of hooks and things like that are the exact same nothing changes right everything works in the exact same fashion in the exact same way now what we want to do next is we have um if i if i had an input field right so i'm going to give you guys a quick example of the differences so in this case you would have um text input right it's a text input and text input has a value called text so it has a value called text and yeah so text is i think it's text actually um i think it's maybe value or is it text value yeah says value i think value and then value would be name right so if i go ahead and and do this now you can see like i said by default it says there's a text input field and the value is set to name right in this case what we'll do is we'll set this to blank right and i'm going to make this the name but i need there's also a change event right so just like we had input fields they get changed and updated in react react native we have a change event so i think it's on change and um this so typically we had e and remember e.target.value is how we got the text from the input field and in uh in rec native it's very simple they just give you the text straight away and then you can pretty much go ahead and say set name to that text so it's a little bit simpler and react native when the way they do that and i think this will be enough to work so if i type in a oh okay so it's not on change i think it's on change text on change text that one so now if i go back and we go it should be underneath here there we go and if i go ahead and zoom in i'm going to say abc okay perfect so you see now i'm updating the state so you can see like i've got the text input field so i'm going to go ahead and hide that so you've got text input the value is the name piece of state and then we've got on change of text so unchange text and it just shoots off text every time i sort of type something in so abc123 and then you can see that updates this piece of state and then what we have is the profile component that we wrote before is taking that piece of state so that name piece of state is passing in as a prop for here inside the profile component and then we just rendered that out underneath right so here if i was gonna just dramatize i could say profile is boom this guy and now you can see if i do this it says profile is sunny yeah so that makes a lot more a little bit more sense and what i would say is to make it super visual what we can see is now you've got the app at the top and then you've got this profile section and this is honestly like it depends right so again figure out the workflow that works for you in what you're doing at that point in time so i always find myself kind of like uh switching between things so imagine if i if i'm working on my styling of my app right now right so i can't sometimes have the app.styles underneath and i'll be like okay this makes sense because now i can kind of start my app i can see it getting updated and it's super quick right so if i want to change the background to green i can go ahead and do that and i can be like oh yeah actually i want to have two profiles i want the name to pop up twice and now i can say sunny okay cool and i can go here and i can change this to blue action i really like that and then you see it just makes sense like i can kind of do all this stuff very quick i don't have to kind of mess around between different screens and different windows and then and and a very handy shortcut is command p so command p is like this very quick way to run through your app so i never you'll never typically see me opening the file tree and kind of running through it like this and that's like i'm really searching for something but what i tend to do is command p and i'll type in profile and just enter and it opens the file for me right and if i do command pp it goes back to the previous file i was in so these are very quick tricks that make you a lot quicker as a developer right so command pp and you pretty much go back and forth between the previous files so now if you're if you're coding in this one um you can go back to command pp and if you want to go two files back you just do ppe and you kind of cycle through it you see that so you kind of just run through it right so that's going to be very very handy in sort of like uh and speeding up your your development time and getting quicker with that sort of stuff so that's going to be awesome what i would say is as well guys is in a previous video i talked about um implementing so i would recommend at this point everyone going ahead and building out a react native app up to this point and also go into that terminal and type in like i so you see it says opening in ios right opening the ios simulator and what this does is i mean hopefully it doesn't kill the computer when i'm live but um what this will do is it will pull up ios simulator and it will just go ahead and boot up an iphone so you would have to probably most likely install your your xcode and things like that for for the ios simulator um otherwise android again you need to do that for android i'm not sure actually if you need to have xcode for this i think you might be able to do it without it but with that said you might be able to go ahead and um and make it work otherwise but yeah so the simulators are typically slower but once they sort of work it it should speed up pretty quick so i'm gonna i'm gonna close that for now and the point is is that again i would kind of go quite far with doing it on the web because you can see webs super quick you're gonna get a really nice experience um and then it's gonna be pretty close to the app and then i would kind of go ahead and test it on the app once i get so far so i'd kind of use this kind of view or this kind of setup to build up react navigation uh to set up redux on the sort of store and everything like that to get everything on that sort of things up and and um then i would go on to uh the sort of simulator because it works out a bit quicker doing it that way right so it'll be a bit quicker doing it in that fashion um so any one question for this if i have to build an application like a amazon clone so i have to use a firebase and redux to manage the state right so the same way we did it in react um so it products firebase authentication and then so remember just kind of kind of break it down into features right so if you need login then well firebase authentication will help you do that now if you need um if you need a database and you need sort of tracking of orders and you need to have like carts and things like that then firebase storage is going to be the uh the way to go with yeah so firebase firestore that would be really good for you um and what about mongodb so again mongodb now remember firestore is a nosql database which is the same structure as mongodb but you get the realtime benefits using firestore mongodb i would say to learn about mongodb go ahead and check out the make sure you go ahead and check out the man stack builds because the man stack builds we cover a lot of all that stuff mongodbe um so what i would say is do the clones right so i just want to ask like so everyone here right now how many of you just raise your hand with people who've got cameras on or type it down how many of you have done a a certain degree of clones so i'm raising my hand i've done that pretty much right there yeah so you've done them right yeah one column okay so one clone uh at two you how many were you saying one or one okay so i can see a few people have one up so pedro's got three up um anisha's got two up um okay so now patrice has got a seven up okay awesome nice patrice nice dude that's awesome man yeah um what i was gonna say is i see loads of twos threes right and things like that level up guys and i see i tell her it was like i got five i got five on my belt okay um so you want to make sure you like like do more builds right so i can see in the in the chat as well we've got uh sahana two brian four antonio six okay cool i highly five more than five nice right so what i was saying d has got half damn it go on you know like yeah will it be good that if i uh create a design so we can collaborately work together all of us you know one component for this person one component so they can learn it also so i build a crm application full from scratch to the production so i would say honestly in my opinion for you all to benefit the most right what i would say is for the clones right so to try and do as many clones as you possibly can there are literally about um oh nice jessie's i joined nine days ago what's up clone finish awesome nice um what i would say is guys there are literally 20 to 25 clones right um so so and i know that someone e5 will be exact 25 to be exact damn man literally the guy will start doing that too yeah there's literally there's 25 clones right so i mean i don't even remember building 25 clones [Laughter] but the point is that like so many i i built so many in my previous company so many things new stuff yeah you're gonna build out a bunch of stuff but what i would recommend now to progress for you guys is build out the uh build out the clones and and and you might be thinking yeah but i've done like a few clones i think that's enough the but the benefit is guys each one posed a different like sort of challenge in different areas for example the google clone presented a different challenge and we had to set up a google api and use it in a very different way um the hulu clone had some ui design elements that were challenging the amazon clone the five day challenge one hundred percent if you guys haven't built that do the amazon five day challenge that is a full build full stack it's gonna have front end back end it's gonna have loads of uh everything is covered in that build and strike payment processing so it's a really good yeah very very powerful powerful system uh way to do it now the way i would say is when you saw how deep is working on google cloud now awesome um so i would say make sure you go ahead and i just registered messages as well that's that's awesome stuff um and yeah like all of like a flexbox is going to come leveling up all those things it's all going to be pretty much a case of and so she says thanks so much for because the rule of 0.65 and 0.35 with the sidebar and chat or whatsapp clown yeah so most people don't actually know how to use the flex rules properly is in like you might have used flex and sort of like flex wrap is the furthest you went right but when you actually figure out that flex can do sort of screen separation in terms of like 30 of the screen is this 65 screen or the 60 70 of screens is this and then you kind of containerize things and start thinking in a containerized approach design becomes quite easy actually and you start to kind of like break down and and then what i would say is go to websites like dribble so that's i'm gonna just drop it in the chat right now so it's uh dribb or with two or three e's dribble.com right this is a game changer of a design sort of thing so if i'm going to build an app now i go to dribble i just literally type in the kind of app i'm building and there's like remember ui is a skill in itself right building clever ui systems and things like that and ux systems it's it's like we spend a lot of time to become good developers same with ui and ux right they spend a very long time there's a lot of things which make design good now you take inspiration from those kind of places like dribble.com and then kind of like strip down the sort of things that you see like the patterns you're seeing and again you see it's just pattern recognition everything comes down to like recognizing patterns and what sort of trending what are people into right now flat design is quite in fashion right now um and you see that combine that with the clones and you're literally combining that on the clothes and i would be shocked if you if everyone in this car hasn't landed a job in in the next um three to six months like as in it's literally that simple like don't over complicate it like build the clones um uh look on dribbles start putting in your so clones are one thing but also always have a side project of your own if you don't have a side project of your own you're definitely losing out there because that's where you basically take the knowledge and you're not listening to like oh sunny said do this so that's what i'm going to do to make my app work instead now you're like right no i've got a whole different use case which nobody else has done because this is my app um if you're if you were into hair styling and things like that right like you can make a barber app or something like that right like yeah and sort of like everything is around the booking system for barber shops or something like that i mean you could go into that kind of detail if you like patch was a student um he is a student sorry and he was about he was a bartender before so what he did is he actually went ahead and built a bartendering app right so i worked closely here coach patch 101 and he basically went ahead and built bartendering out and that was awesome because then he ran into problems which only he was running into that weren't available in a clone and he had to use the skills that he picked up in the clones to overcome that and that's essentially exactly what happens in a job right you're going to use the skills that you've picked up on all these other things and then you're going to apply it um so that's why i would say make sure you're doing that apply the code the rule of three so the the rule of thirds so you're always spending a third of your time in and or everyone here right now well done because you've literally satisfied a third of that time requirement because you've been in a position where you've learned from somebody who is more experienced more sort of like has got more like kind of skill in that domain so you can pretty much pick up a lot of tricks and tips and sort of shortcut right so for example like i bought a fancy camera right now i'm not gonna go through and pretty much spend ages on google right i'm gonna find someone who is an absolute badass in videography and i'm gonna literally just be like i'm gonna just show me everything and and do it that way so the guy i bought the camera from i pretty much made friends with him and now i'm shooting tips back and forth with him and he's got a lot of videography jobs and i'm pretty much just going to tally along with him and just kind of film with him and that's how i'm going to become really quick really quick really fast because literally like somebody has spent years and years and years acquiring that skill and you can just come along and this is this is the fun fact you can come along and kind of pick up all the gems um very quickly right because it's like reading a book when you read a book the chances are there's only like a few key takeaways from the book but the book itself takes ages to read like or for i don't know for you it takes me ages to read a book sometimes honestly like and even with audible even on times two i'm just like i'm constantly going back because i phase out um so i mean but the thing is you're going to get a key takeaway now if somebody had read 50 books and came to you and said this is what i learned from 50 books you've not only saved a bunch of time now of course reading the 50 books yourself is going to be super more valuable than actually just taking someone's word but the point is that when it comes to skill you can literally kind of shortcut that that sort of that that succession right and you can kind of like take that shortcut and you can just like crazily jump past senior even senior developers you can just kind of like overtake them right now like it's crazy because i have i've literally still had i'm in contact with a lot of senior developers that i was working with in when i was a junior developer and they're like hey dude like where are you at right now and this and that and if they saw what we were doing on youtube and stuff like that like holy like oh my god like you're doing this this this and it's because like you you don't have to just because it took a typical like senior developers a couple years to get to that point you could be at that point in the year there is nothing stopping you but the only thing is is that there are some things for example debugging experience that stuff does take time which which you can't skip past and remember there's a balance that you can't expect to be really good at something and not be willing to put the time in and just always looking for that shortcut because it doesn't work that way and remember like i think i can't remember which quote is a quote it is but it's somebody said it takes ten thousand hours to can even consider yourself as an expert of something right so if you if you've done like a hundred hours and something you'd be like yeah i've really put in the work and stuff like that is it's 100 hours 10 000 hours nope so carrie i'm working right and now suddenly those eight hours that you were you put in you like i was debugging for eight hours oh my god like uh i'm just you know like i should be a fullblown developer now is that 10 10 000 hours nope so keep on working right like you see keeps literally put set your ceiling so high that you just have to keep working to kind of reach your own sort of like limitation otherwise the the sort of person in your room your colleague this and that if you're not surrounded by the right people who are pushing you it's very easy to kind of limit your growth right you kind of want somebody you want to be in a room full of people who are just like absolutely push yourself to your limit and uh and that's going to be your best way to push as a developer um and another thing which we are seeing in in us the trend has been changed like an interview they gave us you know uh 20 to 30 questions and asked us to complete in 13 minutes right before you go to the next step but this has a questions which you have to do it in a paper or somewhere so i i would say honestly from from the the experiences from from firstly where are you getting these interviews from i'm very curious because they're they're very yeah because i definitely mean yeah these are nuts i can say i bought so long in industry but i never did this kind of uh i never faced this kind of interviews yeah if somebody put a a a piece of paper in front of me and said 30 questions you have you have 30 minutes i would literally be like oh i don't want this job anymore like you can take the pen and paper and you can give it someone else okay i'm literally i'm not working in a company like this right like you and i i just got a un interview uh not interview it is a screening text written a test thought they said one hour no 45 minutes uh and i believe it is a 30 questions in it right so what i would say is honestly at this point don't focus on those too much because the reality is is if you if you're hearing like me frank um anyone else who's landing clients or anything like that um who are telling you otherwise that the majority because even in my experience i've yet to come across that extreme of like of even like a react versus angular i have had companies come to me with migration requirements we have an angular app or we bought an angular app and we want to migrate it to react are you interested and i said no and this is again it comes down to what priyanshu said be comfortable with saying no and declining jobs so like the fact that he knows that at 13 years old and he's getting primed with that is really something that we should we should all look up to because you being comfortable with saying no might sound easy but you really do have to build that skill to be able to do that because um you could be in a room where somebody's willing to offer you 70 grand 80 grand for a job but it's going to it's going to have like a negative impact on your growth or your future success right but you might not see that because you're kind of blinded by the the 80 grand right and we call this like uh we call this a golden golden handcuffs right and the reason why they call golden handcuffs is because like it's like you think you're in the golden situation right like you're getting paid money like everything's good but they've literally got you and they're kind of like they're kind of like they're limiting you because they they kind of like they've used the salary to pretty much go ahead and like cuff you up and sort of limit your growth right and a lot of companies will do that which is why i would even say i'm quite extreme when it comes to salaries and and some of the students who might know this like i push like i wouldn't push for like a a a two grand raise or a three grand raise i'll push for like a ten grand raise or like oh oh like 10 to 20 gram raisin and and that might sound like wow like how what the hell is he talking about right but there's ways to situate yourself for example if any of you know what devops is devops is a very highly paid sector inside of software development right devops if you're a full stack developer and you you're you pick up devops skills on the side and you build up your own projects you get very comfortable with ci and all this other stuff and then you kind of get you move into a company let's say you move into a company at 50k right so they're paying you 50k as a base salary unless they they're devops guy they're paying um 80k right because devops get paid very well right now imagine the devops guy what i would do is i would move into that company i would shadow the devops guy which is exactly what i did in my first company and then i basically went ahead and i was watching him and i was like dude like this is amazing man like you're and do it in a fashion where you you make them feel good right like if you go up someone say oh that's easy man yeah i can do that no one's gonna want to work with you right but if you go up to him say like that's awesome stuff can i please like learn from you would you mind sharing some tips i'm guarantee no one will say no to you like and if they do you just like you know be nice about it and and and move on like but the point is i pretty much said to him like i was like yeah like can i just pretty much shadow you next time you do a deployment next time you do any sort of ci work just give me a shout and and we started doing that now i picked up the skills required to take over the the devops position in the company and then he had to leave right so about seven months later he left right now think about it they were paying somebody 80 grand right to to fulfill this role and then they're paying me 50 grand so imagine like as in this is a hypothetical um situation but but um but i did use this in a different sort of the numbers were different but i did exactly this principle and i boosted my salary uh about 20k right and and the point is that like my he left the company and i said to him i was like i am now doing devops plus i'm the full stack developer who has got my feet into loads of different parts of the software right there like i've done a lot of different and part of the app build and part of the web app that we've built and things like that and i also picked up react native on that job now justifying 20k as a pay rise when they were previously paying someone 80k is like you know like this is kind of a still right like now they don't have to pay someone 80k they're just paying you an extra 20k and you're doing the devops as well as the some development work right and do you see like it and now you've done them a favor so they actually like you a lot more and two you've got a lot more a whole lot more respect and authority in the company and you're also picking up skills which which remember uh you wanna and you wanna say yes to the opportunities which are gonna be uh like sort of um exponential in terms of your growth in the future right so picking up devops is gonna boost you big time in the future right learning redux is going to boost you big time learning react native is going to boost your big time but doing things like angular vs react that to me compared to like picking up devops is like a downward trajectory there's in this it's not a downward but it's kind of a much less it's not it's basically it's going to just like imagine if that's going to increase my development at this rate right it's only very very small amount but if i start learning devops my salary is going to quickly go up and it's going to really start to peak quite high um you know it is it it is worth to tell you these things what i am getting uh in return from you it is highly valuable for me at this time because i was i was preparing for you know my intro is getting screwed up because on the both the technologies which i am working on and it takes a lot of time to prepare for interviews it takes from ground zero to the complete you know yeah and it was very hard for me to remember each and every point in technology so so think of it this way it's only on one yeah yeah so think of it this way so remember if you ask me tomorrow to sonny do you remember how to do like uh do you remember how to how you used react navigation and had like customized headers and things like that and react native i'll tell you straight up no i was like i will tell you i did it at one point but uh if you said to me that you remember off the top of your head i'd be like no i don't remember the top of my head like i know it's possible i've done it in the past and even if i didn't do it in the past i know it's possible so it can be done right and then from that like you know that something can be done so it's just about figuring out how to get there right and so the first thing is is that if any of you get an opportunity take the opportunity right as in like if if there's a freelancing gig for a for react job yeah take it and it's like you tried that yeah yeah they literally go on up work sign up an account uh and then if you have an opportunity go ahead and take the opportunity right like if somebody offers you a job and even if it scares the crap out of you take the job right and it's literally a case of like imagine you're in a plane jump out the damn plane right and you will figure out how to survive on the way down right that's the kind of way i put it right like and you will figure out ways to survive right like you will definitely yeah yeah exactly you'll figure out some kind of crazy way to figure out like indonesia hope we have a parachute like you you'll make a parachute on the way down right that's what i found because unless you put yourself in that situation where you have that extreme pressure to perform right you're never going to be put in that situation like when our bodies are very like acclimatized to like never push ourselves further than we need to like if you're in a comfortable position and you're getting paid you're eating good everything's kind of like you know like your body's like i don't need to work harder than i am right now like it's all good right if you anyone who goes to the gym knows this right like you have days where you wake up and you're like uh i don't really need to like you know i don't need to go to the gym like i'm good right but there's going to be days where like but if you if you have if you signed up for like let's say like a a boxing fight right you know that fight is coming right like you know that if you don't fight your ass is going to get whooped right like if you so you're going to train like because you have that immense pressure now it's the same as in the development world right if you have a job and somebody's like right the deadline is in three weeks do whatever it takes to get that done now you're going to be networking if you need to network to find someone who will help you yeah you're going to be you're going to be learning react if you need to learn react you're going to be doing redux if you need to learn to relax but you're going to do crazy amount of in three weeks that you never would have done unless somebody had stuck it in front of you it's like kind of like a soft gun being pointed at your head right like is somebody saying right now now perform and then you're like oh okay i have to do it now right and and this is the case for a lot of things that we just as humans that we need some kind of stimulus to kind of like push us and what i would say is the best stimulus and the best part is is like you get paid right like you get paid for it so take the opportunity but if you don't take the opportunity you're not going to get paid and two you're not going to push yourself out of that comfort zone to the point where you would actually be really benefiting yourself if anything when you don't take that job most people see it as yeah i'm not gonna get paid two grand from that job but what i see as no you just lost two grand and you lost all of the opportunity cost of the learning that you would have got as well right so like yeah think of it that way yeah i committed that mistake yeah so think of it that way and then and then suddenly a 2000 job is no longer a 2000 job it's 2000 plus the opportunity to learn a hell of a lot which is infinitely valuable because you can coach with that information freelance with it and then another job with it so you see it i see yeah no i will take your advice here yeah yeah i will note it down here exactly um i'm glad you say that sunny by the way no awesome yeah because um i'm kind of finding myself in the middle of i have to you know uh where i'm working on a minimal viable chatbot or thing and then i'm like okay the chatbot is done yeah away the youtube dashboard oh wait the styling will wait the data oh why the hell is the firebase not working wait no notifications in firebase oh i'm working in react and sometimes i feel like having a lack of experience yeah um you know makes me not being able to over to always estimate how much things still need to be done yep so i'm trying to think of it and just be like okay no don't worry about that just what's minimal cut your losses you know almost got the parachute sometimes by accident i guess but um yeah so that's what i find hard yeah but i have to say um you know with the builds you guys uh have i i think i'm i'm i had enough experience to see the patterns yeah so with the whatsapp clone for example i had a very unstylish chatbot but now i may you know i used your tricks from the chat room and now i made it use your dashboard and i was never able to put the elements in one container and see it like okay this is a column direction display now i was just able to do it and that was just so amazing so i can definitely recommend everybody percent pay the bills and then take from it and then also uh save the builds on your computer yeah it's actually sort of a database and then be like um like oh where did i find this because actually building a chat but i have the whatsapp clone next to it yeah take it one step further push it to github so push it onto your own personal github and then you would like to see yeah yeah because because i even had this problem yesterday where we have an internal tool that me and qazi built and uh and then i was like i can't find the code and then uh i couldn't get through to kazi because kazi was doing something at a time and then i was um i was kind of scrambling around on like old an old external ssd and i was kind of like trying to find this code and i was like god damn it why didn't i just push this thing to github and uh and like it we all make the mistake but the one thing is if you just push that code get up now it's it's it's gonna make your profile stand out a bit more i mean even if it's private it's still another repo on your account um and it's always like the amount of stuff that you're going to look back at as reference is it like your reference material is literally like golden because you wrote it right like as in if you wrote the material it's going to be golden it's going to be literally catered to you and how you work and how your brain works um and it's going to be something that you can always look back to and i always look back at old stuff and repurpose things and really like come back and i'll improve it and i'll kind of like uh i'll grab i'll be like i remember i did something in that project and i would kind of be like i just need to do that again so i'll go back and i'll grab that snippet accordingly okay done now now i don't need to spend hours on trying to figure it out and i can go ahead and grab it now something i want to go ahead and say um is nice because whenever you were saying niche you felt like you were calling my name out um jesse i want to add to what you were saying before so you you mentioned about the um uh sort of like uh some kind of like pressure to kind of like keep pushing you to do like the dashboard or another feature or something like that right like and i was kind of talking about um like the pressure of like a job or something like that is is like or a deadline for an app is is a really good motivator right but if you what happens if you don't have like most of us don't just start off with clients like we don't have clients right like what if you don't have a client how do you set yourself a goal to to push yourself and pressurize yourself into that position how do you get into that position without clients without deadlines and stuff like that because it's very difficult you might be thinking i can't because i i don't have a client so i'm not going to get that yeah i guess it depends on who you are as a person yeah what you want to achieve with programming to be honest um like i of course the client well the client or the business coach i told you about the you know that was really for me an incentive you know because i want to do good i want i want to make this a cool app you know so i said okay build the habit so first of all some people when they start out their energy is very high yeah and then when you start out their energy burns a little bit up you know they in one week they build a creative project they start out they work 50 hours on it you know let's say they're motivated and then they start burning up and then it slows down motivation goes down um and it burns up basically so what i've been trying to do i've been testing since summer a little bit how my energy management in because that's a very important thing when you're developing your energy management i have the tendency also sometimes especially when i just um solved a bug i tend to be like i have to sleep at 11 but i tend to start you know be coding at one yeah every 1am i have to stop myself because i want also to be able to code the next day with a fresh mind so to keep to to not do this to not spike you have to do like one percent two percent one percent and then you build it up so that's the first you got to build the habit you got to have the discipline then yeah of course working towards the goal yep so you got to know yourself some people are extremely stressed when they start coming closer to the goal yeah so they're like paralyzed some people have that um i don't have that like i have a lot of ideas a lot of things and then just before the deadline i'm like it that was way too much like yeah like strip it make it minimal just do this and i wouldn't i have not been able to deliver a project like 100 100 100 where i'm like okay i'm so incredibly um i you know because i always felt like okay this should have been in it this but if the client is happy and you did the communication well about the features the minimal features for that session uh then it's okay so i always have if i for my projects if i have a let's say 10 features the client has and i'm i'm aiming for 12 but actually in my mind i have 15 lined up in the case of like i have that place of over delivery you know so that sort of stuff if you plan that on 15 in your schedule but you know you you come out on 10 in the end you're still being able to get that deadline and have really good results so yeah it keeps me going two things you you touched on without realizing that which i really kind of live by now one is the the way of building habits right habits are a way of like like uh jesse said like and it's very true motivation dies uh motivation in the beginning is skyrocketed right like you are so pumped you're like i'm gonna be the best damn developer in the entire planet i'm with bill gates right like and then uh like as you code as you hit more debugging as you hit sort of like more pain points you're like that comes down and then your discipline has to kick in right now discipline by itself is very up and down like it's very like a roller coaster ride one day you're super disciplined and you do really well another day you're super lazy you don't do much so one thing that i found that really works is habits right habits is amazing um start with very simple habits right so literally like every single day uh read a book called atomic habits very very good book um yeah yeah exactly like it so atomic habits yeah atomic house very good book and uh i just bought that as well um so what i would say is is literally building a very like just imagine like if every single day you did and uh and like this is say two hours of work right in 10 hours a week that's 10 hours in a month that's 40 hours of development right but imagine the consistency of that the consistency of that is going to is going to be to a point imagine if every single day you put in two hours towards react right and then imagine on the seventh day if you're really tired and you're kind of like you know like i don't really want to do this i'm like oh i hear debugging or you've done that for six days now so breaking that streak or breaking that habit would is is a lot harder than kind of because now you're like oh like it will kind of eat you underneath and you've you've created your own internal pressure right which which pressures yourself so that is my first tip for and and i do that with kazi a lot and we we sort of go back and forth with streaks and things like that so like we have workout streaks we have different kind of work habits that was the first thing i would say and the second thing that you touched on what was it what did you say after that because it was a really good point um yes that exactly so there's a really another good book that everyone should read called the 10x rule by grant cardone right and 10x rule is one it's amazing for for money investment and things like that it's really good book to read but the the whole point of tax rule is if you want to get any form of success you need to do like like crazy amounts of work that other people just won't do right and what i mean by this and because like imagine if you go ahead and set yourself a goal like of of i'm gonna code um i'm gonna code um let's just say i'm gonna code an hour a day every single day for the next week right now what grant cardone says is he says no like all right so 10x that right is it like and i'm just giving you an extreme example right like it's in like this is like a very extreme example but let's say okay let's say you said you're going to call 30 minutes a day but then grand cardone would say like 10x it so so but but he but he tends to talking goals right so it would be your goal let's say if you want to make a um your goal was to make 20 000 by the end of the year he was a 10x sat to become 200 grand right now the point is is that even if you fall short of your goal chances are you're going to smash 20 000 right because your goal was so high that like even if you've came short of it you would still surpass your original goal right yeah it's also what elon musk says right the goals that you have for 10 years why don't you set that for the next six months exactly exactly it's really impossible it's like well but you got a lot faster than if you would remind mind just 10 years exactly elon musk one of my best uh he's definitely something i look up to as well and that was a really good part yeah though he said to carry onto yeah no no it's okay i just wanted to pick on what you said about habits i think one really good book for everybody is the four tendencies from gretchen brewing okay uh which one is this four tendencies oh four tendency or two it's more like uh it is about the their your inner expectations and you're out the outer expectations so the inner expectation are you the kind of person that says if i have to run every day five kilometers will you do that yes people will do that you know once they set that bar for themselves the goal they do that no they don't want that street to be broken some people when you talk about our expectations is expectation from the client from your boss from your then some people say if somebody asks me something i will always do it so you have four four different personality types everybody is in some way some of the personality types but let's say you're a rebel you're below that it means like you don't really give a about inner expectations but you don't even about our expectations it means you're only motivated by what you do yourself you choose what you do for example you also have the questioner the questioner will only do the inner expectations right that person thinks is good for them but when he gets our expectations he will ask questions right and then you have other types of persons but it's really important to know that about yourself because when it comes to deadlines it's really um yeah good to see how do you behave around external expectations yeah for me i'm i'm sort of like between questioner but definitely a rebel so even if my boss would say it should be done by data then i would say okay great but i have to do this this and this you want me to do this or you want me to do that if that's possible we can switch this i can move this faster for you what do you like and then i just do my own stuff that's a typical question rebel kind of person an obliger for example an obliger is the kind of person that says boss says needs to be done by monday obliges okay no questions asked gets to work you know up holder will also uh but it's really interesting because the upholder is the kind of person that says i'm gonna run every day five kilometers he's gonna do it no doubt if the upholder says i'm gonna make 100k next year he will do it no questions asked and then it's really good to see if you're with teammates who's more of an obliger and who's more of a rebel yeah how the communication is so that's really a good point to know about yourself when it comes to deadlines that's just what i wanted amazing no amazing i think everyone go ahead and check out that sonny i have one technical question now yeah i want to design something which has uh you know uh unlike a view a list of items i get it from apis and i have to provide a links on it it is a single page application and i want when i will open one document or one record it will have a further you know tabs in it for for this sort of question for these sort of questions i'll tell you slack slack me uh because because it can get very granular um and it's kind of hard for me to send you those yeah um send this like yeah how i want to build it yeah yeah uh so it will help all of our community people too yeah no definitely go ahead and do that and that'll be that'll be awesome uh so guys takeaways from that read four tendencies right it's really really good book it's gonna help you guys a lot it's going to is any any kind of and also thank you calvin kabande says dude these calls are awesome keep it up and kudos to everyone chiming it amazing stuff thank you brother uh he's always charming in the course amazing guy and um what i would say is as well is um so a final sort of takeaway point is um oh damn it it was on the you know it's on the tip of your tongue was it i was gonna say it'll come back to me but the point is oh yeah so something really hit me recently and i was kind of reading a book as i was driving to melbourne's house and it was kind of like it's again it was part of 10x rule and it was make success your obligation right like we all look at success as a choice right everyone in this call right now we all look at successes like yeah uh it's a choice like i i ca i choose i can choose like some people just get it like you know but like or some people are born into it or something like that but no like change your relationship to success and make it like you are obliged to be successful if you don't do what it takes today like everyone's still on this call you're doing the exact thing right you're showing up you're still like here you're still like improving even if you get tired even if you feel like you know oh my god i've done too much whatever like keep on showing up because like if you don't do that you're literally being unfair to yourself because you're literally taking it away from you right so if you start thinking of it in that sense it becomes an entire different lifestyle and and decision making completely changes right even if your friends want to go out and things like that no but you are obliged to your success and if your success was to sit at home and and write code for three hours then you better stay at home and write code for three hours right like is in obviously there's always going to be a balance but the point is is that like if you want to achieve success you need to do like crazy things that people and the truth is that people who are successful if you look at everyone who's successful to like crazy amounts um jeff bezos elon musk um bill gates all these people they were at points in their lives they literally sat in a room and grinded so damn hard to the point where like nobody was sitting behind him saying like giving him a pat on the back saying you're going to be a millionaire you're going to be a billionaire like everyone's going to know your name and things like that you just absolutely have to like put in like ridiculous amounts of work to to scale up and it was only until i started doing that i saw my life actually start to transform and completely take a different direction ever and before that it was very much a case of you know like a kind of a small like a slower kind of progression um anish kara says just one question can hard work ever go to your waist okay so very good question actually so can hard work ever go to waste put it this way if you put in work no matter what it is right if you put in work in the gym right and you and you don't see a result if you put work in in sort of your in encoding and you fail and then you didn't whatever don't look at that as a failure look at it as no i tried something right like i said i tried something for example say you're coding react right you're coding and you're trying to do redux and it didn't work and everything failed right you must have taken a bunch of different approaches to solving that problem right now you you know that those different approaches don't work right so try a different approach and then and and that's all people do it doesn't matter how senior you are people have just ironed out more approaches than you that's all it is and you keep doing that and you start looking at and things like that and honestly that i forgot who said it but it's so damn true everyone has no idea what they're doing just at a different level right so like a ceo of a company literally is thinking in their head how the do i manage thousands of these like employees how the heck am i going to get everyone paid today like uh the the economy is crashing how do we how do we get everyone still getting paid like there's families on the line things like that right all of that stuff is that there's this sort of like the struggle of a ceo and then imagine it like a developer right how the hell do i get redux so i can i don't know how to get this thing working you know i don't know how to do it everyone has no i like as in and trust me when you go into a senior like now i i would be considered as a senior in in a development team and in and react anyway and if somebody says to me um yeah so this is true like he says thomas edison found 99 different ways of not inventing the light exactly so you see he just ruled out 99 ways and then he got one and it all it takes is and but then that would be seen as and and you would typically see as overnight success or just natural genius and people would kind of tend to tend to put a label on it and because the truth is is that like naturally our bodies aren't inclined to to put ourselves in that much pressure right it's not much sort of like a pressure to perform to that extent and you don't want to kind of go and fail 99 times you know like you don't really want to do that right but i'm telling you that's the truth and there's and a lot of people here exactly and and i went out albert einstein says something else i'm not smart i'm just willing to make more mistakes than the average person and that's the truth it was only until i started to kind of like dive out of my comfort zone and be comfortable with failing right if you're not failing then you're not pushing hard enough that's what i always say like keep it very simple right get on get comfortable with being uncomfortable that's my number one thing uh and literally like and if you're not failing like just push harder pretty much like when you start failing and you start like hitting actual failure points that's when you're like even like think of it in the gym if you put on a weight that's too heavy yeah they usually say like you fail like like or keep doing a bunch of reps until you hit failure right until you can't push that weight off now what do you do you don't just quit right if you quit what's the point of like training in the first place right you come back to the gym the next day you keep doing it like you you eat better you do other things like just like in coding if you don't get you you code every day but if you don't get your sleep right your brain is just like it's like a it's going to be fried right and i see loads of people like yeah i've been i've been up for for six days straight and then i'm you know i'm gonna be the best damn developer i've got like three hours sleep average this week that's not good right like you need to take care of your but your body is a vessel like you need to kind of like eat some eat right sleep right all of those things why we sleep is a really good book um i'd recommend everyone reads that it's really really good book um i didn't realize how much sleep did for you until i read that book um but i would say yeah so with the on that note guys uh amazing session so many people are still here and like and it's crazy even on youtube we still have a bunch of people
