00:01 - hey so listen I'm at this event with my
00:08 - who's right now reading a very important
00:11 - email and what I want to talk about is
00:15 - commitment so right now what I am
00:19 - committing to at this program what they
00:23 - want us to do is envision our upcoming
00:25 - year 2019 and see what are some of the
00:29 - accomplishments some of the biggest
00:31 - accomplishments do you have made I have
00:33 - wrote down my vision oh and by the way
00:37 - we should make this gear lives the motto
00:40 - in action over anxiety
00:43 - so we wrote down some of our visions
00:46 - my biggest one for the upcoming year is
00:51 - commit all the way to cover program go
00:56 - all-in on the business and pull all in
00:59 - on helping developers like you board
01:03 - inspiring aspiring to be a developer
01:06 - we're already are a developer and help
01:08 - you scale your career $200,000 a year or
01:11 - more and I felt like up until this point
01:17 - I've been holding back to a certain
01:19 - degree I could be making more videos I
01:22 - could be putting out more courses I
01:25 - could be getting on more calls with you
01:28 - and I feel that I haven't jumped it all
01:33 - the way and made that much of a
01:35 - commitment you know I went kind of crazy
01:36 - it but I know myself I can actually even
01:40 - vote and even more so that's what I want
01:43 - to do for yourself what I want you to
01:45 - think about is what would be your
01:47 - biggest accomplishment of 2019 the
01:50 - upcoming year
01:51 - what can you commit to and pick one to
01:57 - two things
01:57 - do not pick more because then it gets
02:01 - too much and you won't be able to
02:03 - actually achieve that so pick one thing
02:06 - maybe for you it's becoming a full-stack
02:09 - developer maybe for you it's becoming a
02:12 - data scientist pick one thing but choose
02:16 - to commit all the ways because to
02:20 - many times we say we want to do
02:24 - something and then we half-ass it
02:26 - and we become mediocre and a lot and we
02:30 - never actually end up becoming best at
02:31 - anything so you want to spend this
02:36 - upcoming year being the best at one
02:38 - thing so what I want you to do is for me
02:41 - I want to grow clever programmer like
02:45 - crazy so my goal would be have a million
02:50 - people subscribe to this channel but
02:53 - that's a more result baseball right but
02:57 - what I want to commit to is a more
02:58 - action visible that I can control so I
03:00 - might not be able to control getting a
03:02 - million subscribers but what I can
03:04 - control is making five to ten videos a
03:08 - month sending you guys a lot more emails
03:11 - that just give you a lot more value
03:14 - building new courses so that's what I'm
03:18 - going to be committing to five at least
03:22 - five videos a month if not ten so what I
03:26 - want you to do is if you have watched
03:27 - this video what I want you to do is put
03:30 - one thing that you would commit to and
03:33 - drop it in the comment below
03:36 - just one alright and write it as a
03:39 - sentence what's that one thing you're
03:41 - going to commit to for 2019 for it to
