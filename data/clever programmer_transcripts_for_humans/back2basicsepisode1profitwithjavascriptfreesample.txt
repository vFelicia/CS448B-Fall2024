03:11 - davey guys
03:14 - the stage is always i mean everything on
03:17 - the web is actually using
03:18 - these html and javascript stuff okay
03:21 - there are a couple of websites that use
03:22 - php
03:24 - but that's kind of it um
03:27 - it's probably one of the most uh
03:30 - top growing david you're zoning in and
03:32 - out man
03:33 - oh yeah what's going on
03:37 - my audio we lose your audio for

03:51 - normal microphone yeah
03:56 - okay let's go ahead and oh good
03:59 - guys yeah
04:02 - okay i'm gonna okay before that i just
04:06 - and a few guys ask that same question
04:09 - what do you think about web developers
04:12 - okay because i want this to be really
04:14 - interactive
04:15 - and i don't want this to be more
04:16 - notorious okay
04:18 - otherwise go for it what do you think
04:20 - what's your development
04:21 - web development is usually just making
04:24 - websites and
04:25 - actually not just making websites it's
04:26 - using making use to make servers and
04:29 - like you can just make things and which
04:32 - could change people's lives in some way
04:34 - like you can make interactive website
04:35 - you can make the next facebook if you
04:37 - want
04:37 - you can make the next twitter if you
04:39 - want you can also pass some useful
04:41 - information like blogs where you can
04:43 - just post all of your thing which
04:45 - which which is which could be
04:47 - information informative to people or
04:49 - just as your personal diary or whatever
04:51 - like uh posting your information on
04:54 - internet
04:55 - it's good if you know web development
04:57 - because then you have the flexibility
04:59 - you don't have to use some other
05:00 - framework to make your website
05:02 - you can just make your own website and
05:05 - push it
05:06 - and that's why web development is very
05:08 - important
05:09 - and i react right now react right now is
05:12 - just
05:13 - booming everything and it's it's never
05:15 - been more famous than it's right now
05:17 - and there are so many opportunities if
05:19 - you just go to indeed
05:20 - you will find a whole lot of
05:22 - opportunities for react so
05:24 - this might be the best opportunity you
05:25 - would ever get for web development
05:28 - absolutely yeah well when
05:32 - joe who else would like to add to this
05:36 - yeah i mean web development in short in
05:38 - a nutshell is basically
05:40 - designing websites and and you know as
05:43 - and
05:44 - this course basically trains you to
05:46 - learn all the available frameworks
05:48 - technology that you can use to come up
05:50 - with very creative solutions
05:52 - ultimately you're you're coming you're
05:54 - trying to come up with the solution like
05:55 - take an example
05:56 - of a barber shop or a dentist there's no
05:59 - way for
06:00 - that person to advertise unless you know
06:03 - he puts it on yellow pages or yelp
06:05 - but if you as a developer can can come
06:07 - up with a way that
06:09 - they design a nice quick website he can
06:12 - then get more business so it's like you
06:13 - know developing something that will
06:15 - provide value
06:16 - to the to the client whoever the client
06:18 - is so i look at it that way
06:20 - how i can bring in more value to the
06:23 - person whatever business that is if it
06:25 - is a
06:25 - small shop versus a big company it
06:27 - doesn't matter
06:28 - but this like you come here to pwj to
06:32 - learn those skills
06:33 - to be able to deliver that solution so
06:37 - long story short awesome
06:42 - yeah yeah can we connect this with
06:45 - a worldwide web as well and yeah
06:48 - in terms of development yep absolutely
06:51 - yeah so
06:52 - internet it's the world wide web and
06:55 - every
06:56 - a website is how how you represent
06:59 - yourself or your business on the
07:02 - internet or the worldwide web
07:03 - right
07:07 - right rudra yeah of course yeah yeah
07:09 - yeah
07:10 - okay define what would you like to add
07:13 - into this
07:16 - uh yeah um
07:20 - yeah web development is uh yeah for sure
07:23 - uh creating a website
07:24 - uh yeah with the html uh structure
07:29 - you need to have a good layout um yeah
07:32 - the css for nice styling and
07:34 - the javascript for uh for yeah
07:38 - for the functions um
07:41 - yeah and it brings it all together but
07:43 - it's not only creating a website it's
07:45 - also communication skills
07:47 - with with companies or auto developers
07:50 - it's team playing it's
07:52 - it's more than just developing a website
07:56 - and the other skills that yeah that we
07:59 - are learning here
08:00 - in the profit with javascript
08:04 - uh by uh attending these new goals by
08:07 - getting a success coach
08:09 - [Music]
08:10 - trying to teach others and all that
08:14 - all of that is part of also part of web
08:16 - development
08:17 - and um yeah it's a challenge
08:21 - because you have to find ways to make it
08:24 - effect easy
08:27 - yeah good looking and uh
08:32 - and put it to the standards put it to
08:34 - the stands of the company that one show
08:36 - wants you to build their website so it's
08:40 - yeah adjusting in
08:43 - everything okay there is this one
08:47 - quotation about web development where it
08:49 - says
08:50 - website sells you 24x7 no employee does
08:54 - exactly okay so i'm gonna say what what
08:58 - development is
08:58 - okay guys web development so now you
09:02 - have this internet that was introduced
09:04 - in 1996 i don't need to go through the
09:06 - history
09:07 - but in the 21st century
09:11 - right i just love telling stories okay
09:13 - so don't mind me
09:14 - going all these centuries and all this
09:16 - stuff so internet was born
09:19 - and the internet is kind of like
09:22 - a place where you can promote yourself
09:25 - you can promote your business
09:28 - you can promote almost everything and
09:30 - anything right
09:31 - so now with the growth of the internet
09:34 - and we have almost
09:36 - billions of devices connected to it
09:39 - and now what happened is earlier it was
09:42 - really expensive to have an internet but
09:44 - now
09:45 - we have almost 120 people in here and
09:48 - from all around the world you guys are
09:50 - connected into this phone call why is it
09:52 - because of the internet right
09:54 - so internet does not only allow you to
09:57 - create
09:58 - websites and all this stuff it helps you
10:00 - to get connected and it's all
10:01 - all that that made a global village like
10:06 - made me to connect with david who is in
10:08 - hungary made me to connect with joe who
10:10 - was in us
10:12 - made me to connect with devin made me to
10:14 - connect with everyone in this call
10:16 - okay that's the internet and now with
10:19 - that
10:20 - we got some an opportunity that has
10:22 - grown
10:23 - that we can promote our business we can
10:25 - promote ourselves
10:27 - on the internet so what's the best way
10:29 - to promote yourself
10:32 - a website or connecting on social media
10:35 - like facebook
10:36 - instagram twitter those are all social
10:38 - media platforms that have been created

10:44 - websites for your business
10:46 - that can help you reach global clients
10:50 - global people okay so
10:53 - as joe said there might be a bubble
10:56 - okay he he's a barber in us
11:00 - and he does not have a lot of clients
11:03 - he's getting
11:04 - right so now what a web developer
11:07 - can offer is we can offer him to make a
11:10 - website
11:11 - and help promote his business online
11:14 - and help him get more clients from
11:16 - around the city
11:18 - right now suppose you gotta go for
11:20 - somewhere
11:21 - somewhere okay what do you do you hit up
11:24 - google
11:24 - you go you google that place and that's
11:26 - how you go and
11:28 - what another thing that happens on
11:30 - google is when you search for something

11:32 - coffee shop get a lot of suggestions
11:34 - right and suppose if your
11:36 - business is there and you have a website
11:39 - it's really easier for your customer to

21:49 - developing html this is auto close tag
21:53 - um oops i even clicked it
21:57 - so auto close tag is let me let's just
22:00 - go ahead and demo
22:01 - what it does so i'm just going to type
22:03 - in a random
22:04 - html tag let's say strong and i just
22:08 - close it
22:09 - and it will automatically pop in the
22:12 - um the closing deck for it
22:16 - right it just makes you makes your life
22:19 - so much easier
22:20 - uh the other don't think they have that
22:23 - but it's
22:24 - what's okay so that's because of
22:28 - ms bro uh even if you don't have that
22:32 - vs code extension you if you have image
22:34 - working on your vs code
22:36 - then it's gonna work yeah
22:39 - okay next up we will be using
22:42 - auto rename tag right so auto rename tag
22:46 - is if i go again and type here strong
22:50 - and i just uh i don't know i it kind of
22:53 - looks
22:54 - i want to uh rename it for some reason
22:57 - like let's say i want to go with div it
22:59 - already deletes it from the other one
23:01 - from the closing tag and it uh pops in
23:04 - right ahead
23:07 - that's right bro
23:10 - my point exactly yeah yeah
23:17 - this question uh what if we have like
23:19 - multi
23:31 - so you mean i have like three div tags
23:35 - this is what you mean
23:38 - [Applause]
23:39 - oops yes okay
23:43 - so if i have it i can still go ahead and
23:46 - like
23:47 - i don't know rename it like h1
23:50 - it doesn't make sense at the moment but
23:52 - it goes ahead and renames it right
23:54 - but it's still um yeah so your names
23:58 - yeah it actually knows which one uh
24:01 - which one closes which one
24:02 - right so it's just going to make your
24:04 - life easy
24:06 - and especially when you're like a
24:08 - beginner
24:09 - uh it's going to make your life super
24:11 - easy because you
24:12 - will not need to worry about
24:16 - like oh my god did i uh close this tag
24:19 - or did i not what happened
24:21 - nope it's going to take care of it even
24:24 - if you go ahead and rename it
24:25 - uh like some random stuff it's still
24:29 - going to update uh as well so
24:32 - it keeps keeps the tag closed so you
24:34 - don't have to worry about any of these
24:36 - stuff
24:36 - okay all clear yeah thank you there
24:40 - perfect now uh
24:44 - i mean guys actually can you follow it
24:46 - follow with uh
24:47 - follow me with this
24:51 - yeah that's my good sense nice nice
24:53 - second one is
24:55 - what are your name yeah what's up
25:00 - so first we should uh
25:03 - download auto close tag and then auto
25:05 - rename
25:06 - which okay don't worry about that um
25:09 - what i'll do is
25:10 - uh once david goes through everything
25:14 - when uh once david finish goes
25:17 - going through all the vs code extensions
25:19 - i'm gonna drop it in the zoom chest and
25:21 - also in the slack okay
25:22 - yeah okay
25:27 - okay i'm gonna go ahead uh share my
25:29 - screen
25:30 - once again and
25:34 - okay so here we are next up we will be
25:37 - learning bracket pair colorizer um
25:40 - this literally does what it says but
25:43 - actually i recommend
25:44 - downloading the second version um
25:47 - there is like nothing super fancy change
25:50 - but obviously they are going to update
25:52 - the second version and they are going to
25:55 - focus on that more
25:56 - so this makes actually more sense when
25:58 - you have a javascript file
26:00 - right i'm just going to go ahead and
26:02 - create an index.js
26:05 - and like i can literally like throw
26:08 - uh don't matter how much of
26:12 - brackets added and it will color
26:15 - all like the pairs okay
26:19 - so if you like have something don't
26:22 - worry about it don't freak out um
26:24 - i'm just going to type wait damn it yeah
26:26 - yeah why you just got
26:28 - changed yeah why just put a bit low
26:31 - oh hold on a moment uh
26:34 - let me let me do a quick sound
26:37 - preference stuff
26:40 - yeah even people on youtube today voices
26:44 - okay uh is it better now
26:49 - yeah no okay okay
26:53 - for some reason drop the volume i don't
26:55 - know
26:56 - okay so uh
26:59 - don't freak out i'm just going to create
27:01 - a an array
27:04 - which will be completely empty and i can
27:07 - just say radar map
27:09 - and if there's something yeah okay
27:12 - just one sec uh classical is asking is
27:14 - there any additional settings
27:16 - needed to enable this effect to take
27:18 - place in the editor
27:20 - no when you install the vs code
27:23 - extension it's
27:24 - automatically gonna set up and it's
27:26 - gonna work for for you
27:28 - suppose there are some settings that you
27:30 - might have changed earlier
27:31 - then it might not work so if it does not
27:34 - work
27:34 - just take a screenshot of it and drop it
27:37 - in the slack channel okay
27:41 - okay uh
27:45 - where's that yeah perfect okay i just
27:48 - threw in some gibberish code this
27:50 - probably like would freak out at the
27:52 - first moment uh
27:54 - don't even try to memorize this but this
27:57 - is just to show you how bracket bar
27:58 - colorizer works
28:00 - so up here you can see uh they've
28:02 - colored it like
28:04 - completely or uh yellow but
28:07 - uh if i go ahead and like delete this
28:09 - one and for some reason like completely
28:10 - forget about it
28:12 - i can already see that the editor is
28:13 - like freaking out like oh my god what's
28:15 - going
28:15 - on it's expecting a closing bracket and
28:18 - i can like
28:19 - oh my god when did i miss it right
28:22 - that's when uh this tool comes in handy
28:26 - uh so i can see that this is like purple
28:29 - one
28:30 - yeah we got the pair of for it blue one
28:33 - nice
28:34 - whoops there is an uh there's like a
28:37 - yellow one
28:38 - and there is no closing so i can just go
28:40 - ahead and close it and everything is
28:42 - going to be uh cool except for
28:45 - i wrote some bad code in here
28:51 - hi david sorry to interrupt but what
28:53 - does the dot map
28:55 - function do exactly uh the dom map is
28:58 - is going through the array don't worry
29:00 - about it for now
29:02 - it's actually covered in the module so
29:04 - if i had like several
29:06 - of these and like there will be
29:07 - something uh the
29:09 - map something would be covering
29:12 - this part this isn't just some gibberish
29:15 - call here
29:15 - just to show you how this is just for
29:18 - time
29:21 - sorry yeah no it's just
29:24 - it's just for demonstration purposes
29:27 - this doesn't even work
29:29 - i'm gonna even delete it okay
29:32 - um yeah let's go for the next
29:35 - uh next awesome
29:38 - what you call the extension that you can
29:40 - go ahead and install
29:42 - uh i think the css for matter is
29:45 - actually
29:45 - very handy it helps me whenever i'm
29:48 - uh like um david david david
29:52 - can you please be closer to the
29:55 - microphone
29:57 - okay how about now
30:01 - don't have mine okay okay okay
30:05 - so uh css formatter actually does what
30:08 - it says
30:10 - uh it's just a simple formatter for
30:12 - random
30:13 - uh css tags so i can just go ahead and
30:16 - like
30:16 - if i have a tag which is strong uh
30:19 - and like i don't know make it
30:24 - or i don't know okay tell me your class
30:28 - name
30:30 - app let's say
30:35 - let's say we i we have an app.header
30:39 - don't worry about it and i don't know uh
30:41 - like display
30:43 - um flags guys okay
30:46 - when we are typing code in here don't
30:49 - freak out
30:50 - ignore what the code is okay you know
30:53 - what's happening here i'm just
30:54 - uh it's for only demonstration purposes
30:57 - i'm going to show you
30:58 - every single thing uh what i'm doing
31:01 - here okay
31:02 - uh this is
31:09 - okay disclaimer don't try out this code
31:12 - what
31:12 - david does sometimes it could be
31:14 - ingenious to your computer okay
31:16 - doesn't prettier do that for you exactly
31:19 - it's the same thing
31:20 - uh so you can go ahead and use prayer as
31:23 - well
31:24 - that's uh actually a lot better it
31:28 - shut it goes ahead and and does all this
31:31 - stuff whenever
31:32 - you're uh saving the file so
31:36 - i could go ahead and if it's still yeah
31:39 - and i'm like
31:39 - uh okay i'm not i haven't configured it
31:43 - but
31:43 - previewer does the same thing uh css
31:46 - formatter
31:47 - is like specified on css what's up
31:51 - um you know why why why do you sound
31:54 - like
31:55 - you have big bass like
31:58 - yeah sound like you're far away from the
31:59 - mic oh
32:01 - still yeah yeah can you change your mic
32:04 - can you change your mic and try
32:06 - okay
32:12 - he doesn't need to change the mic just
32:13 - to come closer to the mic
32:16 - okay how about now
32:20 - i'm going to go ahead
32:27 - yep and how about now
32:31 - oh that's awesome okay
32:35 - we will go with it we will go this way
32:36 - then okay
32:38 - so it just goes and just uh does
32:42 - the uh formatting for you okay
32:45 - uh don't worry about again this code we
32:47 - will be teaching every single thing
32:50 - now another thing i want everybody to go
32:53 - ahead and
32:55 - is uh i think yeah it's visual code in
33:00 - telecode
33:01 - it's just going to give you oh yeah
33:04 - visual studio and telegram
33:06 - yeah that's right yeah uh
33:10 - it's actually going to come handy when
33:12 - you're typing
33:13 - uh javascript so it's like um
33:17 - it's going to give you more uh hints
33:21 - so like when i go like all these start
33:24 - stuff
33:25 - are coming up whenever um
33:28 - when i have this uh intel code installed
33:30 - right it's just giving you more options
33:32 - to choose from and it's going to help
33:34 - you
33:34 - go heading some back-end application or
33:38 - you're creating a react application
33:40 - right so you remember
33:41 - npm i express and although all this kind
33:44 - of stuff or for example
33:46 - mpx create react app you know all those
33:48 - kind of stuff
33:49 - those are because we have node.js
33:52 - installed
33:54 - uh on the computer right this is the
33:57 - thing that you want to go ahead
33:59 - and install i think you can go with the
34:02 - lts version
34:04 - um current is like still under
34:06 - development
34:07 - and all this kind of stuff so it
34:09 - actually says recommended for
34:11 - most users don't worry about the other
34:13 - one
34:14 - just go ahead install this uh you can
34:17 - install it on
34:18 - windows as well so it's very it's very
34:21 - powerful
34:22 - yeah this is only for react right
34:26 - no no this is when you're
34:30 - developing for the back end so you are
34:34 - like doing back-end development like
34:36 - node.js applications
34:38 - and when you're doing react applications
34:40 - right and
34:41 - there is a lot more uh one more
34:44 - functionality but this is
34:46 - where we are using it okay
34:50 - all clear everybody with me but we
34:53 - we are obliged to uh but we are obliged
34:56 - to
34:57 - install node.js to
35:00 - uh to create uh react up that's right
35:03 - yeah yeah yeah you know so both ways we
35:06 - need it
35:09 - suppose you are just working with html
35:12 - css and javascript
35:13 - you don't need your notepad but if
35:16 - you're going to work with
35:17 - frameworks or you're going to work from
35:19 - with library
35:21 - javascript packages and all this stuff
35:23 - then you're going to need to have
35:25 - no js installed okay exactly okay so
35:28 - come from here can we can we download
35:30 - this
35:31 - node.js from google yeah yeah go to
35:34 - nodejs.org
35:36 - and you'll get it okay let me go ahead
35:38 - and share my screen
35:42 - so uh you can go ahead and just type in
35:47 - nodejs.org and
35:49 - it's going like this is how it looks
35:51 - right
35:53 - so i'm just going to go ahead and drop
35:54 - it in the zoom chat
35:56 - so you guys can have it
35:59 - uh um
36:02 - yeah i just dropped it in you can go
36:04 - ahead and use that link
36:06 - uh to get to this page and you can just
36:10 - go ahead and hit download you will inst
36:12 - you can install it
36:13 - afterwards this call and yeah
36:16 - that's pretty much it about node.js
36:19 - but during installation they don't have
36:20 - to do anything other than
36:22 - click the exe correct exactly i think
36:25 - that's where people were getting
36:26 - that's where people had most questions
36:28 - is when they installed they were getting
36:29 - different errors
36:30 - so you might so just a general uh
36:34 - shout out when you it also depends on
36:37 - the type of pc
36:38 - what softwares you have installed on
36:40 - your pc there might be some
36:42 - issues so that can be you know you can
36:45 - send screenshots or if you run into
36:47 - issues and can do that on an add-on
36:49 - one-on-one basis so in general you
36:51 - should not
36:53 - um okay um
36:56 - i have a question by aaron saying can
36:58 - you explain
36:59 - how to create a react app so react
37:02 - will be covered on tuesday's coaching
37:04 - call with sunny so
37:06 - today's coaching call is absolutely for
37:08 - beginners and we are not going to cover
37:09 - about all those stuff okay
37:11 - yeah afterwards i have a question
37:14 - yeah yeah
37:17 - okay i have a question regarding the
37:20 - node.js
37:22 - [Music]
37:23 - version so usually we need to download
37:26 - the latest
37:27 - version uh the latest support
37:32 - yeah so okay there is this two versions
37:35 - when you go to nodejs.org
37:37 - the latest and the lts right
37:40 - download the lts one and not the latest
37:43 - one because the latest one it's
37:45 - it's like still under development and
37:47 - it's gonna have
37:48 - bugs and all this stuff for normal for
37:52 - you
37:52 - for what do you say normal users
37:57 - yeah for usual users you basically go
37:59 - with the version that has been
38:00 - tested and proven which is the lts
38:03 - version
38:04 - the current version is still under beta
38:06 - phase it's being it's being tested on
38:08 - different environments so it's not
38:09 - solidified yet
38:11 - so you use the lts but i guess the
38:13 - audible version is on the latest one
38:15 - because
38:16 - we're using in the tip calculator the
38:19 - model
38:19 - we use the import statements in node.js
38:23 - the import statements uh can be used in
38:26 - the lts fund too right
38:28 - david i'm not sure
38:32 - [Music]
38:35 - don't worry about the uh the other one
38:38 - just go with that that's perfect most
38:42 - stable right exactly it's more stable
38:45 - exactly
38:50 - this is uh the node beams are getting
38:52 - updated every time so is it also
38:54 - good to have nvme
38:57 - what's up
39:03 - the note version manager i mean i keep
39:06 - installing the
39:08 - new node versions and using the nvme i
39:09 - can switch between the nodes
39:15 - [Music]
39:25 - what's up okay
39:29 - okay let me tell you okay
39:32 - um guys let me tell you since you're
39:36 - really beginners you don't need to
39:38 - really focus on uh
39:40 - version managers you don't need to worry
39:43 - about you know
39:44 - i need to have all this latest stuff and
39:46 - all this stuff you know
39:48 - just what you need you need to get only
39:51 - the basic stuff in
39:52 - and then you're good to go you don't
39:54 - need to have the latest mpm
39:56 - or the node version to get started you
39:59 - don't need to have the
40:00 - latest you know the beta version of
40:03 - vs we are showing you the basics that
40:06 - you need to get started okay so you
40:07 - don't
40:08 - we don't need to pull go dive into all
40:11 - this
40:11 - nvm or code
40:14 - what it was called don't worry about it
40:18 - just go ahead and install them because
40:20 - later on you will be needing this
40:22 - in the course right that's all you have
40:25 - to worry about now
40:26 - just go ahead install it you will just
40:29 - you can just forget about it afterwards
40:31 - right and you will be just able to uh
40:34 - like
40:34 - go like super uh smooth in the course
40:37 - that's all this school is about
40:39 - helping you out to uh be able to succeed
40:43 - as fast as possible right
40:46 - and just have like a super smooth
40:48 - experience oh cool
40:54 - yeah i i have a small question related
40:57 - to visual studio
40:58 - intel code do we have a specific
41:02 - library for only js keywords
41:09 - kfk1 javascript uh keywords
41:13 - for the the extension that you mentioned
41:17 - it gives us uh multiple words
41:21 - keywords but some of them they are not
41:24 - related to
41:24 - javascript is there a specific tension
41:30 - talking about the intellisense david
41:32 - he's talking about the intelli
41:34 - whatever you're showing remember so he's
41:36 - saying that intellisense is not just
41:38 - javascript
41:39 - javascript specific it gives you
41:42 - whatever
41:42 - non-relevant javascript as well which is
41:45 - not relevant to javascript
41:47 - i mean it's not always limited to
41:49 - javascript yeah a couple of times
41:51 - it throws up a couple of other stuff but
41:54 - when i mean it intelligent and knows
41:57 - that
41:57 - you're what you're working with and
42:01 - the thing is yeah the thing is you don't
42:04 - need to have everything perfect to get
42:06 - coding okay you don't need to have your
42:09 - intellicode
42:09 - to only show javascript keywords and you
42:12 - don't need to have
42:13 - the latest as i said you don't need this
42:16 - is the basics
42:17 - guys you're just starting and you don't
42:19 - need to fall into all these rabbit holes
42:21 - and you know trying to just get started
42:25 - like download no js install with the lts
42:28 - version
42:29 - download visual studio code install all
42:32 - this
42:32 - vs code extensions and you'll be all
42:34 - good to go and i think they would have
42:36 - somewhat

44:43 - on the final day we're gonna deploy this
44:46 - website
44:47 - on netflix or five or something
44:50 - using git so you're going to be learning
44:53 - git you're going to be learning how to
44:54 - deploy your website you're going to be
44:56 - learning basics of html you're going to
44:58 - be learning about css
45:00 - it's going to be everything so basically
45:02 - it's going have a bit of front-end stuff
45:04 - right
45:05 - yep exactly okay okay
45:09 - so let's go now uh and i'm gonna just
45:12 - show you dude i have a small
45:14 - small question okay yep
45:21 - hello
45:25 - i think javascript intellisense comes
45:27 - default with vs code
45:29 - is that right what's up
45:45 - with vs code yeah everything is right
45:47 - yeah it's built into javascript uh
45:49 - uh vs code right now you know
45:53 - right now you know what i'm going to say
45:55 - yeah now most most of the stuff is
46:00 - okay sorry so most of the stuff is yeah
46:03 - it is coming
46:04 - uh built into uh vs code
46:07 - but if you want to like make uh power it
46:09 - up and
46:10 - like have the ability to be able to see
46:14 - more of those stuff then you will
46:15 - definitely want to go ahead and download
46:18 - um the intellicode as well right it like
46:21 - adds more stuff
46:22 - into that okay that's all it's about
46:25 - okay let's go back to github desktop now
46:28 - um like understanding how that works
46:33 - so boom okay everybody sees it perfect
46:37 - so uh you can just simply create
46:40 - like clone repositories add repositories
46:43 - create new repositories
46:45 - um and you can like fetch whenever you
46:48 - make a chain
46:49 - uh make a change you can just go ahead
46:51 - and push it uh
46:52 - changing branches we will show you guys
46:55 - everything
46:56 - um it's just a demonstration on that
46:59 - it's so much easier than having
47:02 - a terminal open all the time and like
47:06 - typing in stuff stuff like get add had
47:10 - thought and all those kind of stuff
47:11 - because for for the first time
47:13 - it actually uh is super hard to
47:16 - understand how
47:18 - all these stuff work and it's just a
47:20 - very beginner friendly way
47:22 - to start coding so um
47:26 - i'm going to show you where to go ahead
47:27 - and download this so
47:30 - let me look up the stuff from here
47:34 - okay um also david we got a suggestion
47:37 - asking people
47:39 - uh the list of software that we need to
47:41 - install and all this stuff
47:43 - yeah today david yeah
47:46 - we will do a long video after this right

48:24 - uh like yesterday and the call we
48:27 - uh uh sunny show
48:30 - uh shows us uh that there's a get uh
48:34 - extension and obvious code for get
48:37 - get lunch what do you recommend
48:40 - using github desktop or extension on the
48:44 - vs code
48:45 - and which is but actually i use both
48:49 - personally so i have git lens as well i
48:52 - mostly use git lens to
48:54 - um whenever i have something committed
48:59 - it shows up a couple of icons here so i
49:01 - can like
49:04 - compare what's happened uh since my last
49:07 - commit
49:07 - and i i am able to see uh
49:11 - what did i add and what time so that
49:14 - that
49:14 - would be my recommendation but to
49:16 - actually learn
49:17 - how git works i would definitely
49:21 - uh suggest to go ahead and download
49:23 - github desktop so i would recommend
49:25 - using
49:25 - both right
49:28 - okay thank you hope that helped a lot

53:25 - html
53:27 - um nothing super fancy going oh my god
53:30 - i forgot two super important uh
53:35 - extensions so these two live server
53:38 - and live share thank you okay yeah
53:43 - most important stuff right so liveshare
53:46 - is livestream makes me able to create a
53:49 - link
53:49 - and i could just literally drop in uh
53:52 - drop to amana
53:54 - and he could hop in and we could
53:57 - work on the exact same code we could
53:59 - work on my computer
54:00 - even his he could work on my computer
54:03 - um and we could just like
54:07 - do the pad programming stuff which is
54:09 - super powerful
54:10 - it's going to like skyrocket your skills
54:13 - and all those kind of stuff
54:14 - so i definitely go ahead and download it
54:19 - and the other one is live server
54:22 - which we will be using i think we can go
54:26 - ahead and start using it right now
54:28 - i mean it's super easy to set up you can
54:30 - just go ahead
54:31 - download it and down here
54:34 - it should appear but for some reason oh
54:36 - i'm not in the html5
54:38 - so whenever i come into the html5
54:42 - um still not appearing
54:46 - okay um yeah it sometimes
54:50 - freaks out and does some good stuff but
54:54 - put right click right click i think you
54:56 - do right click right click
54:58 - on the live server yes yeah you need to
55:02 - turn it on
55:06 - even show up here no you can go to your
55:09 - documents from the extension side by the
55:13 - document and click live server yeah
55:16 - start replying no no to start a live
55:19 - service
55:20 - should have uh it will also work
55:23 - if you put here right then the first
55:26 - option
55:28 - i didn't even know about this one nice
55:32 - okay so it's super easy it's easier than
55:34 - i thought
55:37 - okay
55:42 - okay here we go okay uh just so
55:45 - i get an idea everybody put your hands
55:48 - up both hands
55:49 - if you uh if you're complete beginner
55:52 - web development and don't even know what
55:54 - html is
56:00 - okay
56:03 - leave what are you doing um
56:06 - everybody with the camera turned off
56:09 - yeah i see muhammad is complete beginner
56:11 - okay so we will be going ahead and just
56:16 - give you an idea of how how it looks
56:19 - like
56:21 - and what is it let me go ahead and
56:25 - share my screen and
56:29 - i'm turning on my screen brush and okay
56:32 - can you guys see the whole whiteboard
56:36 - okay yes okay nice
56:39 - boom so html
56:43 - boom so it's actually uh it's the
56:46 - abbreviation of
56:47 - hyper text markup language
56:51 - if i'm not mistaken and it's basically
56:53 - that is right
56:54 - yeah thanks you're
57:07 - [Music]
57:10 - yeah it basically creates the structure
57:12 - of the website
57:14 - whoops yeah so let's
57:17 - let's suppose that we have a website
57:19 - like this
57:21 - and like let's say that we got some
57:23 - sidebar going on here
57:25 - some top bar uh
57:28 - some let's say if it's facebook and we
57:31 - got all these posts going around here
57:33 - we got the chat uh and all those kind of
57:36 - stuff and like
57:37 - let's say this is the like uh this is
57:40 - where comments go
57:42 - this is where this uh text goes
57:45 - now this is the structure yeah
57:49 - so this is the structure of this page
57:52 - right and this is what html does for us
57:56 - it's not going to look nice it's going
57:58 - to be looking ugly without css and all
58:01 - this kind of stuff
58:02 - but it gives damage there's a nice nice
58:05 - gif for that whoa nice gift for that
58:09 - go to go to go yeah go to google and
58:12 - just search
58:13 - um html css javascript okay
58:18 - and go to google images you'll find one
58:22 - okay and i'll show you
58:25 - which one is that uh
58:30 - okay sorry
58:31 - [Applause]
58:34 - um
58:45 - yeah exactly that one i love that oh
58:49 - yeah
58:51 - yeah yeah that works that works
58:55 - okay is it literally how it is it gives
58:57 - you the skeleton stuff
59:00 - makes it look awesome
59:14 - yeah guys this is how we learn here
59:20 - okay yeah um let's actually create our
59:24 - first we're not going to do anything
59:26 - anything super fancy i'm just going to
59:28 - show you a couple of
59:29 - uh html tags and all those kind of stuff
59:33 - nothing super fancy going on here uh
59:36 - so let's actually everybody open up your
59:38 - vs codes
59:39 - right who's ready who's pumped
59:43 - show a thumbs up nice
59:48 - okay
59:52 - with just a quick question yep
59:55 - so what is the tool that you used to
59:56 - draw those boxes those colorful boxes
59:58 - you made uh it's called screen brush
60:02 - okay thank you uh yeah i'm just gonna
60:06 - drop it in the
60:09 - i think it's a mac only app by the way
60:12 - okay that's why i got a print app on
60:14 - windows
60:15 - and even if that is a paid version right
60:18 - oh i see yeah okay yeah because that
60:22 - gives you gives me the ability for like
60:25 - freezing
60:26 - freezing stuff and i don't know
60:29 - all these i think even i can go
60:32 - you know uh yeah i mean
60:36 - if you go ahead and like search up
60:39 - screen annotation too
60:41 - you will definitely see a lot of them
60:44 - okay let me quickly check how my
60:49 - batteries are
60:54 - okay
60:56 - i'm not sharing my screen sorry guys
61:00 - yeah screen share perfect
61:04 - okay so how can you um
61:09 - okay so this is how you will actually
61:11 - see a uh
61:12 - html file without anything it's going to
61:16 - be empty
61:17 - there's going to be nothing there is one
61:19 - secret
61:20 - uh you create a little
61:24 - symbol that if you type in
61:28 - uh yeah this is going to be an
61:31 - abbreviation and it comes built into
61:33 - your vs code right
61:36 - so if you just type in uh an exclamation
61:38 - mark and just hit return
61:39 - it's going to pop in all this kind of
61:41 - stuff and then you will not
61:44 - you don't have to worry about all these
61:47 - headache
61:48 - right yeah
61:51 - okay david just a just a small
61:53 - introduction interruption
61:55 - kartika is asking can you guys also dive
61:57 - into some prototyping tools
61:59 - where we can get a bit better grip on
62:02 - css
62:03 - okay so before we actually dive into
62:06 - coding
62:08 - the next week we'll try to do something
62:11 - like that right you know david
62:12 - like create a prototype of the website
62:15 - on sigma
62:16 - or wxt and show guys
62:20 - you guys how you prototype and also
62:24 - get a better idea on css yeah yeah yeah
62:27 - exactly that would be helpful
62:30 - thank you no problem guys like this is
62:34 - completely driven by you so we just want
62:36 - to
62:37 - give you as much value as possible okay
62:40 - let's go back to uh creating a super
62:43 - simple
62:44 - nothing fancy uh html file so actually
62:48 - it is running on my 5500
62:52 - uh port and
62:55 - if i was able to yeah this is my
62:58 - part okay so this is
63:02 - a sometimes uh there are a lot of people
63:06 - who might find it boring
63:08 - but we are doing this actually for
63:10 - absolute beginners so guys
63:13 - guys literally if you enjoy
63:16 - you definitely need to understand all
63:20 - these basics and you have to master
63:21 - these first and then you can jump into
63:24 - react because that's when you will get
63:26 - super powerful
63:27 - okay uh let's make this quick i'm going
63:30 - to
63:31 - create a couple of stuff on my on my
63:33 - screen you can go ahead follow me
63:35 - but the homework is going to be
63:40 - to check out one landing page or
63:42 - something that you like and
63:44 - try to replicate that with plain html
63:48 - right now you don't have to uh worry
63:50 - about styling and all those kind of
63:52 - stuff
63:53 - you can go ahead but don't worry if you
63:55 - cannot just try to make it look like
63:57 - that
63:58 - okay just try to replicate the structure
64:02 - okay so
64:05 - uh we will get this plain stuff going on
64:08 - here
64:09 - i'm just going to add a couple of stuff
64:11 - like
64:13 - i will create a div which will have a
64:16 - class
64:16 - of header
64:20 - uh we are not going to use bam naming
64:22 - for now
64:23 - but when you're working with a client
64:25 - it's highly recommended but just for the
64:27 - sake of simplicity
64:29 - you're not going to use bam and then so
64:31 - there is the header
64:33 - uh we will have like a strong um
64:38 - i don't know let's say a title and like
64:41 - we can create a button in here as well
64:46 - which will say uh
64:49 - click me so i i just want to give you
64:53 - guys an idea of how
64:55 - it all will look like right so
64:58 - we have a strong title up here and we
65:01 - have a button which says click me
65:03 - you can create these by just uh these
65:06 - two stuff
65:06 - right you can also
65:10 - if you want to like make this title like
65:13 - crazy big
65:15 - uh you can wrap this into a h1
65:20 - oops sorry so you can go ahead and
65:24 - grab wait a minute
65:27 - yeah so you can go ahead and rub these
65:29 - into a h1
65:31 - and like put
65:34 - these
65:37 - like a round title right that would make
65:40 - it
65:41 - super big i mean not super big but
65:43 - definitely bigger than what it was
65:46 - it also actually inserts a line break
65:49 - right
65:51 - so you have so you need to know all
65:53 - these nitty-gritty stuff
65:55 - to be able to work with the super
65:57 - efficient level once it clicks
65:59 - it's going to be epic
66:02 - hi
66:12 - head and body shows up yeah uh
66:16 - no i actually i added an exclamation
66:18 - mark
66:19 - that was all that i did and then
66:22 - boom but actually i i think you can type
66:26 - in
66:26 - doc and it's just going to be almost
66:29 - this i mean let's see what's the
66:30 - difference
66:32 - but i always type all the codes manually
66:35 - it never shows up like that like chat
66:37 - and name and all really
66:41 - is there a special extension for that or
66:43 - something
66:44 - yes i mean i have no clue
66:47 - it might not work i mean
66:51 - let's let's hop on a caller let's
66:53 - actually text me
66:54 - uh in the slack and yeah
66:58 - it should be a part if it not like leaf
67:00 - says so
67:02 - i don't know uh let's actually address
67:04 - this issue after this coaching call okay
67:08 - okay okay i have a question related to
67:11 - the
67:11 - what is net vs code
67:14 - so emma is like a tool
67:17 - which which will make you able to do
67:20 - super fancy stuff and like add lots of
67:23 - uh html attacks in just a couple of
67:27 - lines right so i can like i could
67:30 - type in so if i just want to create a
67:33 - div
67:34 - with a specific class name i could just
67:36 - type in a
67:37 - dot and like
67:41 - i don't know i have the app header
67:44 - he's going to pop it in here right so
67:46 - that was a map
67:48 - i i could also do uh
67:51 - this that i want to do we need to
67:53 - configure it no
67:55 - no it's pretty built it should be
67:58 - principal
67:58 - then and that's code okay uh i'll take a
68:01 - look into it
68:03 - and i'm not okay the next thing you can
68:06 - do with the math which is super powerful
68:08 - so you can
68:09 - you can like uh add a url
68:12 - inside of the um inside of the header
68:16 - and inside of the ul you could add a
68:18 - couple of allies
68:20 - let's say you want actually you want to
68:22 - give them a class name of
68:24 - list item and you want
68:27 - uh eight of these with just this one
68:30 - single line of code
68:32 - boom see that
68:37 - i could do oh i'm gonna do it again
68:40 - boom it pops it in i got the div
68:43 - uh with the class name of hatter i got
68:46 - the ul
68:47 - and i got eight of these allies with the
68:49 - class name of list item right
68:53 - how does this class thing work like i
68:56 - have never understood this class and
68:58 - you are completely so class
69:01 - is uh going to be so you definitely want
69:04 - to go ahead and give everything a class
69:06 - name
69:07 - because when you're styling you will be
69:09 - you will uh
69:11 - you will be targeting most of these uh
69:14 - class names
69:15 - right we will be covering it in this
69:18 - series so might be not today
69:21 - but definitely in one of the upcoming
69:24 - calls okay
69:27 - okay and actually one little trick
69:30 - uh which will increase your efficiency
69:33 - so if i go ahead and select class notice
69:36 - that it actually highlights all of them
69:38 - but if i go ahead and click command d on
69:40 - my keyboard
69:42 - it goes all the way down and selects all
69:45 - the classes right
69:46 - and i could actually do it here as well
69:49 - so it selected that one
69:51 - and it goes all the way down and i could
69:54 - like
69:54 - whoops like delete everything and like
69:57 - type hello nine times and it's going to
70:01 - make uh
70:03 - your life a lot easier uh when you're
70:06 - uh when you want to rename a lot of
70:08 - stuff which are not html attacks because
70:11 - of course for html tags it's
70:13 - super easy so that's it
70:17 - so class is basically like a group
70:20 - yeah class makes a
70:24 - class helps you to like target the
70:30 - target the tag and whatever is inside so
70:32 - it makes your life easier
70:34 - um when you're styling and when you're
70:38 - doing some kind of javascript stuff okay
70:41 - let's dive back okay
70:47 - so what we had was the title
70:51 - which was a h1 and we had a button
70:54 - and i also want to
70:58 - create another div which will be i don't
71:01 - know
71:02 - let's actually use them right now
71:06 - so we will be so i want to have a list
71:10 - of like let's say students let's say i
71:13 - want to have
71:13 - a list of all the students in this uh
71:18 - on this website right so i could create
71:21 - a div oh i could create a div
71:25 - which will have a class name of students
71:28 - list just to put it in perspective and i
71:31 - will have an
71:32 - unordered list which is ul
71:35 - where i actually could make an ordered
71:37 - list as well which is in a while
71:40 - and then i'm adding allies which will
71:43 - have a class name of student
71:46 - and because i say c83
71:50 - i'm not going to edit the three of these
71:53 - i'm just going to go with five for now
71:56 - so i can just randomly pick uh five
71:59 - people
72:00 - out of this class so we got swan
72:05 - okay let me let me just put holy yeah
72:08 - so we got swim we got three
72:11 - we got uh
72:15 - oops we got gianna
72:19 - we got uh joe
72:22 - and we got um
72:26 - aaron congrats me
72:30 - david because you're another student
72:34 - see no it's a student list
72:38 - whoops and if i go back to my
72:41 - okay page boom there we go
72:45 - right um so it created an
72:49 - ordered listing the difference between
72:51 - the ordered and unordered list let me
72:53 - show you what is it
72:54 - uh so if i go ahead and change this
72:58 - like notice that it already highlighted
73:00 - and i change it to
73:02 - ul which stands for unordered list
73:08 - it changed the numbers to these bullets
73:10 - right
73:13 - so it's kind of just giving you an idea
73:17 - of how how all these html attacks work
73:21 - you could also like create um
73:24 - so if i wanted to add a link to
73:27 - everybody's facebook profile
73:29 - let's say i wanna wrap swann's profile
73:33 - and i wanna help uh help you guys
73:36 - find swim super easily because when is
73:38 - an awesome success coach
73:41 - uh we could just add an a
73:46 - is uh what does this a stand for
73:49 - by the way
73:53 - anchor egg anchor thank you
73:56 - um snap in whatever link you have
74:00 - it's like let's go and say google.com
74:03 - for now
74:05 - and i'm copying someone putting him here
74:08 - and
74:12 - just in a moment
74:16 - there we go uh it's not going to google
74:20 - because i haven't had
74:22 - the hdtv doing good that thing
74:26 - so now should be just to add david
74:30 - david just to add when you do a ul
74:32 - versus ol i think ul
74:33 - sorts the elements um alphabetically i
74:36 - believe can you do that
74:37 - can you go turn it back to our ordered
74:40 - list
74:41 - of course sure
74:45 - yes so people can know the difference
74:47 - these are the subtle differences
74:49 - that you should be aware or it doesn't
74:53 - i think it just uh no no i think it just
74:55 - adds like a number
74:56 - and that's all right
75:01 - yeah so these are like
75:04 - super easy uh and then like super
75:07 - beginner friendly tags that you can go
75:09 - ahead and like try
75:11 - yeah pre you're welcome of course i'm
75:14 - putting your name there
75:16 - um okay so these are like just
75:19 - to give you an idea of how all these
75:21 - tags work
75:23 - um one uh actually if you
75:26 - give type that uh another dot order list
75:30 - uh uh they like it will
75:33 - give you the specific type of it like
75:35 - whether if you give like
75:37 - orderless with capital a then the list
75:39 - gonna be creating with the capital a's
75:42 - and if you give like a star then
75:45 - the unordered list will be created with
75:47 - star as a bullet point
75:50 - yeah yeah yeah exactly okay
75:53 - um now this is only just to give you an
75:56 - idea of how all these tags work
76:00 - now one everybody um
76:04 - i think the best source for learning how
76:07 - uh to go with these hdmi stuff is
76:11 - we3schools.com
76:14 - uh and and like this thing is like
76:17 - showing you all the documentation
76:19 - right so obviously we couldn't cover it
76:22 - uh on this coaching call definitely
76:26 - but i want everybody to go ahead
76:30 - and create that web page and if you guys
76:32 - have a question
76:33 - like come to us well we are happy to
76:36 - help you
76:37 - and we are happy to give you hints on
76:40 - how you can go ahead with all these
76:42 - uh html ethics right
76:46 - by the way was it informational uh did
76:48 - you guys find it useful or should we go
76:51 - into
76:51 - uh into it deeper
76:55 - or i mean for now uh it's going to be
76:59 - like a touch base
77:00 - but definitely next week and afterwards
77:02 - we will be going into this super dupe
77:04 - okay
77:05 - oh cool give me a thumbs up
77:09 - nice awesome okay i'm just going to show
77:12 - you how
77:13 - show you guys uh to give you an idea of
77:16 - css and what it does
77:24 - so notice that we had a class here okay
77:28 - so um
77:31 - by the way uh i
77:35 - remove this sidebar on the left hand
77:37 - side
77:39 - it's a command b so i can go ahead
77:42 - and say that let's say i want the whole
77:47 - thing
77:47 - to have a green background so i can go
77:50 - ahead type in body
77:52 - and background color and i want it green
77:56 - right is it clear
78:00 - so i have this tag over here right
78:04 - i'm targeting the body tag
78:08 - and i'm setting the background color to
78:10 - green i think it
78:11 - should work for some reason it doesn't
78:15 - maybe it's because i think the dark body
78:18 - what's up oh i didn't link the two
78:23 - okay dark body no no
78:30 - yeah that's another thing uh yeah emma
78:33 - helps with this too you just go ahead
78:35 - type in link
78:36 - and it's going to type in this line of
78:39 - code
78:40 - but we are uh with beginners today so
78:43 - let's go ahead and type in links i
78:45 - thought i thought it was
78:47 - only me who used to forgot linking css
78:50 - files
78:50 - so we can see one professional mod
78:53 - developers also forget it's their third
78:55 - part
78:57 - yeah yeah okay
79:00 - uh so you can just go ahead and open up
79:02 - the link tag
79:04 - like type in rail and that is going to
79:06 - be style sheet
79:08 - so you want to define that that the
79:11 - type of it is going to the style sheet
79:14 - the href
79:15 - is going to be um
79:18 - style css i think yeah let me just close
79:22 - it
79:23 - i actually noticed that link doesn't
79:26 - close up
79:27 - it's because link doesn't have a pair
79:30 - right that's all
79:32 - there are a couple of uh tags that work
79:34 - like this so
79:36 - now that there we go okay now that it's
79:39 - uh
79:39 - connected we have it green okay
79:44 - now another thing uh class so notice
79:48 - that
79:48 - i just typed in body over here nothing
79:51 - super fancy
79:52 - but let's say i want to target all the
79:55 - students
79:56 - i'm just going to hit a dot because this
79:58 - is a class
79:59 - right so remember whenever i'm giving uh
80:04 - class name to a div i'm starting with a
80:06 - dot you can remember it from
80:08 - this thing so
80:11 - let's say i'm going to target the
80:13 - students
80:15 - and i don't know i want to make
80:20 - font font white uh
80:23 - to 900 front white uh makes your
80:26 - font super bold okay
80:30 - let's see what we did there we go it
80:33 - made
80:33 - we made the form super bowl uh we could
80:37 - also
80:37 - uh actually i'm going to remove the
80:40 - class name from here
80:43 - from swamp and save it again
80:47 - and notice that it's like so much
80:49 - lighter but because it's another color
80:51 - it
80:51 - might not be the best example so i'm
80:54 - going to remove it from pre too
80:56 - see so if you
81:00 - if like it's noticeable and gemma is
81:03 - bold
81:04 - pre is light okay that's uh
81:07 - that's how these glasses work but i
81:10 - could uh add the
81:12 - glass at any time whoops
81:16 - and i can say student
81:20 - and pre is going to be bold again
81:24 - all clear
81:28 - everybody everybody with me who's with
81:30 - me yeah
81:32 - sharpies or a tumblr or something
81:36 - nice yeah boxing is a possibility too
81:41 - okay
81:44 - just kind of push myself you know
81:47 - [Music]
81:49 - i think yeah okay so that was kind of
81:53 - like
81:53 - to give you an idea of of how these
81:58 - styling stuff work it's really nothing
82:01 - super
82:02 - deep for now i actually want
82:06 - everybody to go ahead and
82:09 - start messing with this like literally
82:12 - go
82:12 - to some web page and you can like snip
82:14 - it apart with the inspect tool
82:16 - it will show you everything um i can
82:19 - show you that too
82:20 - um let's see how it looks like
82:24 - um i have a question like the other
82:27 - another page
82:32 - how did you link this page with the
82:34 - background color like you had this
82:36 - you have both files in your same folder
82:40 - yeah yeah i have them in the same folder
82:42 - that's actually a
82:44 - really good question you need to have
82:46 - all these files in the same folder we're
82:48 - not going to use javascript today
82:51 - uh noted i created a folder called back
82:54 - to basics
82:56 - which is yeah that's the name of the
82:58 - folder
82:59 - and i have two files in it you can
83:01 - actually go ahead and create like random
83:03 - files like
83:04 - another html with some i don't know
83:08 - it's another html file so it actually
83:11 - adds
83:11 - you can create folders inside here like
83:14 - this is how we create the
83:16 - uh model and all those kind of stuff
83:17 - with sign right
83:19 - and when you're so when you have
83:20 - selected model uh
83:23 - you can add like this is where all the
83:25 - uh
83:27 - model files come right that's kind of
83:30 - how how we add all this stuff
83:33 - okay so is it like the whole page where
83:35 - you start doctype html it's your folder
83:38 - and then you created this stylesheet
83:40 - which is filed within that folder right
83:43 - uh nope actually doctype is
83:46 - in the file which is already in the
83:49 - folder
83:49 - so i when when i created this project
83:53 - i just had the folder then i had to add
83:55 - index.html
83:57 - which in which i just pressed uh
84:02 - the exclamation mark and that added all
84:04 - the stuff for me
84:08 - okay so basically these both are the
84:10 - files within one folder and
84:12 - which is connected to each other by that
84:14 - style
84:15 - exactly okay got it okay
84:19 - so um this is kind of like giving you an
84:23 - idea
84:24 - of how this stuff work and
84:27 - how these things look like i actually
84:29 - want everybody to go ahead
84:31 - like try to mess with these try to like
84:34 - make your hands dirty
84:36 - jump in ask questions use the community
84:39 - okay you have an awesome community to
84:41 - use

87:38 - than four hours
87:40 - so but i definitely i if you're a super
87:42 - beginner i highly recommend going ahead
87:45 - and checking these out this should be
87:47 - enough for you to get your hands dirty
87:50 - and start going ahead and create
87:52 - something

88:04 - yeah it's on youtube it's on youtube um

88:20 - okay time to answer answer questions
88:25 - oh yeah
88:29 - here we go what's up q
88:33 - a yeah q a okay
88:37 - let me just refresh the slido
88:42 - oh we got 40 questions nice
88:45 - jesus why bro
88:49 - are the yellow ones uh oh these are the
88:52 - these
88:54 - how to have a cool cool hair like david
88:58 - grow it
89:02 - exactly including okay which one did we
89:04 - already answer
89:05 - come enough it's more like your turn i
89:07 - think
89:09 - yeah let's go from the first one yeah
89:12 - okay
89:13 - so casey has asked how do you set up
89:15 - websites to be mobile friendly
89:17 - better to start that way or fix it after
89:20 - a normal build
89:22 - okay
89:28 - can you shout if you're here
89:33 - okay see casey left
89:37 - okay in case casey is watching this back
89:40 - uh
89:41 - if you're a beginner i would definitely
89:43 - don't worry about
89:44 - mobile styling for now when you kind of
89:48 - messed around with html css and all
89:50 - this stuff uh that's when you want to go
89:53 - with mobile friendly
89:55 - there are other sources for that
89:58 - to find how to make mobile friendly and
90:01 - how you
90:01 - want to go about that but for
90:04 - if you're a beginner for now i wouldn't
90:06 - worry about it if you're not a beginner
90:09 - um i always go but
90:12 - go like make everything
90:16 - uh flexible and mobile friendly and
90:21 - like i should be able to see the webpage
90:26 - uh perfectly as i'm developing it right
90:29 - so by design it should be flexible
90:35 - yeah i think like making uh
90:39 - you can uh if you're like really
90:41 - constrained on time and all this stuff
90:44 - you can go for a css framework which are
90:47 - creative mobile
90:48 - friendly you know so you don't have to
90:50 - spend time on media queries trying to
90:52 - make it mobile friendly
90:54 - because if you're going from scratch and
90:56 - trying to make websites mobile friendly
90:58 - it's a way too much of work like you
91:00 - gotta say okay
91:02 - for this for this size you gotta say uh
91:05 - we need to you know make this this and
91:08 - this look like this like
91:10 - it's gonna take a lot of work if you're
91:12 - going from scratch
91:14 - but you can try using something like you
91:16 - know
91:18 - css frameworks or something yeah so
91:20 - leave it
91:21 - beginner just try to get it working
91:25 - there we go this has a good point right
91:27 - intermediate add some
91:30 - yeah yeah deep i need yourself go ahead
91:32 - bro
91:34 - that was pretty much all i had to say
91:37 - you're a beginner just
91:38 - try to get it working it's hard enough
91:40 - as it is
91:41 - trying to figure out everything don't
91:43 - take on that battle
91:45 - right now just try to learn the basics
91:49 - when you're an intermediate level add a
91:51 - little bit of flexibility
91:53 - as best you can just to get a feel for
91:55 - it
91:56 - you'll find out pretty fast
91:59 - um i have one more question like almost
92:02 - as a big navy
92:04 - hold on i'm almost done advanced
92:07 - mobile first always because
92:11 - everybody has these and somebody
92:14 - most people nowadays less and less
92:16 - people use
92:18 - tablets or desktops mostly it's like
92:20 - tablet or phone
92:22 - yeah but that's it go ahead could tell
92:29 - yeah but you had a question
92:33 - uh yeah like there are so many basic
92:36 - things
92:36 - like in htmls it's like so many basic
92:39 - things and there are so many software
92:42 - nowadays like bootstrap and all which
92:44 - help us
92:45 - to skip all those basics
92:48 - so like how does this work
92:53 - david what happened uh i think i froze
92:58 - maybe it's in a nice pose what
93:05 - okay hold on am i good man
93:08 - you look good okay yep you're good uh
93:11 - yeah
93:12 - brother can you repeat that same
93:14 - question again
93:15 - yeah uh like in html there are like so
93:18 - many basic stuff
93:19 - where we use a different tag to style
93:22 - in html but nowadays a
93:25 - new thing like bootstrap and all which
93:28 - help us to skip all those steps and
93:30 - directly use the bootstrap to
93:32 - design our webpage right so like how
93:34 - does this thing work like do we need to
93:36 - learn all just
93:37 - all the basic things or like we can
93:41 - start learning bootstrap i mean
93:45 - i would recommend learning the basics
93:47 - first
93:48 - um because then you will be able to use
93:51 - these tools
93:52 - much more efficiently exactly
93:56 - because bootstraps you can use it
94:00 - anyways but if you don't have a good
94:02 - understanding about the basics you're
94:04 - gonna struggle in the long run
94:06 - like suppose you don't know much html
94:08 - css
94:09 - and you know you go for bootstrap and
94:10 - you find it really easy to set things up
94:13 - and everything
94:14 - suppose you come off face a client say
94:17 - not used in a framework you're gonna
94:19 - struggle a lot
94:20 - having a basic knowledge and going for a
94:23 - framework
94:24 - that's completely okay but without
94:26 - having a good knowledge
94:27 - or at least some understanding of how
94:29 - this works going for a framework is not
94:31 - always a good idea
94:33 - that is correct that is correct
94:37 - suggestion yep
94:41 - yes to answer his question i was
94:42 - watching one of the live calls
94:44 - from tatyana and she suggested something
94:46 - called a mobile
94:47 - rwd extension for google chrome i think
94:50 - that would be really useful if you want
94:52 - to design it for mobile and
94:53 - the pc simultaneously
95:03 - like you guys can use the bootstrap grid
95:06 - system at the start like
95:08 - like you're making some cool things
95:09 - right now so at the start you can use
95:12 - bootstrap grid system to make
95:14 - it look like responsive but do not use
95:16 - the complete bootstrap like do not just
95:18 - put every button you see in there and
95:20 - you just make your own things
95:22 - just do that but use the only few
95:25 - components of bootstrap like the grid
95:26 - system which will
95:28 - help you make it responsive and like
95:30 - that's
95:31 - that's okay people do that and that's
95:33 - normal
95:35 - yeah yeah all right let's see the next
95:38 - question we got
95:43 - [Music]
95:51 - [Music]
95:52 - oh these are okay we have a timestamp
95:56 - okay do we also learn react on pwj yes
95:59 - we are learning uh all these modules are
96:02 - coming
96:03 - and we already have lots of coaching
96:05 - calls and
96:06 - we are covering all the basics in pwj
96:11 - you will have you will have the chance
96:13 - to learn react but first
96:15 - please please just go ahead and
96:17 - understand the basics and
96:19 - master those like literally create
96:22 - every single project that you can whoops
96:24 - like create every project that you can
96:27 - using these plain stuff okay what are
96:30 - media i'm enough it's a question to you
96:33 - what are media queries in relation to
96:35 - css i keep hearing about it
96:40 - okay so media queries is how you
96:43 - create buy a new website
96:46 - so like they can show us a
96:50 - sample for them like media and all those
96:52 - stuff
96:53 - oh yeah yeah sure um
96:57 - i can't like maybe you could do
96:59 - something like
97:00 - when you when the screen size decreases
97:03 - the background changes
97:04 - something like that

Cleaned transcript:

this very new uh session um and let's actually get started with a couple of uh presentation stuff okay so today we will be going back to the very very basics of web development amanath is going to be talking about some background stuff and uh all those things and after that we will be touching a little bit of um css and we will also help you guys set up your ultimate profit with javascript um developer environment right let me actually go ahead and share my screen with you um and now should now we should be able to see what is going on okay um awesome you guys see it everybody sees it all good okay now uh we will so you guys have uh the chance to ask any kind of kind of questions that you might have uh just make sure to drop them in the slido um form you you guys have the link and everything uh to be able to drop those questions we will try to unders answer as many of them as possible and we will be just doing that after the presentation okay all right uh let's continue so basics and background amana it's all yours yep okay so as david said make sure to drop any of the questions that you have in the slider and the drop the code will be dropped by david in a sec right david just drop it down we are the drummer like fan the zucchini yeah go on go on okay so basics and background of web development right so what is the development okay before we go into everything we need to know what exactly is the development right so web development is developing with okay web development is developing websites you know about instagram.com facebook.com google.com youtube.com all these dot coms okay and to create those websites you need to know web development right you need to know html you need to know uh css you need to know javascript then also when you're trying to make really big websites like instagram you need to know frameworks like react or angular or view we love react so we promote react okay so hopefully facebook might uh sponsor us for this week and you know all this stuff for a while so hopefully they'll uh they'll sponsor us okay so background web development what do you have to say davey guys the stage is always i mean everything on the web is actually using these html and javascript stuff okay there are a couple of websites that use php but that's kind of it um it's probably one of the most uh top growing david you're zoning in and out man oh yeah what's going on my audio we lose your audio for momentarily now you're okay okay even in youtube the stream is lagging guys oh maybe use your headphones no no i'm using my normal microphone yeah okay let's go ahead and oh good guys yeah okay i'm gonna okay before that i just and a few guys ask that same question what do you think about web developers okay because i want this to be really interactive and i don't want this to be more notorious okay otherwise go for it what do you think what's your development web development is usually just making websites and actually not just making websites it's using making use to make servers and like you can just make things and which could change people's lives in some way like you can make interactive website you can make the next facebook if you want you can make the next twitter if you want you can also pass some useful information like blogs where you can just post all of your thing which which which is which could be information informative to people or just as your personal diary or whatever like uh posting your information on internet it's good if you know web development because then you have the flexibility you don't have to use some other framework to make your website you can just make your own website and push it and that's why web development is very important and i react right now react right now is just booming everything and it's it's never been more famous than it's right now and there are so many opportunities if you just go to indeed you will find a whole lot of opportunities for react so this might be the best opportunity you would ever get for web development absolutely yeah well when joe who else would like to add to this yeah i mean web development in short in a nutshell is basically designing websites and and you know as and this course basically trains you to learn all the available frameworks technology that you can use to come up with very creative solutions ultimately you're you're coming you're trying to come up with the solution like take an example of a barber shop or a dentist there's no way for that person to advertise unless you know he puts it on yellow pages or yelp but if you as a developer can can come up with a way that they design a nice quick website he can then get more business so it's like you know developing something that will provide value to the to the client whoever the client is so i look at it that way how i can bring in more value to the person whatever business that is if it is a small shop versus a big company it doesn't matter but this like you come here to pwj to learn those skills to be able to deliver that solution so long story short awesome yeah yeah can we connect this with a worldwide web as well and yeah in terms of development yep absolutely yeah so internet it's the world wide web and every a website is how how you represent yourself or your business on the internet or the worldwide web right right rudra yeah of course yeah yeah yeah okay define what would you like to add into this uh yeah um yeah web development is uh yeah for sure uh creating a website uh yeah with the html uh structure you need to have a good layout um yeah the css for nice styling and the javascript for uh for yeah for the functions um yeah and it brings it all together but it's not only creating a website it's also communication skills with with companies or auto developers it's team playing it's it's more than just developing a website and the other skills that yeah that we are learning here in the profit with javascript uh by uh attending these new goals by getting a success coach trying to teach others and all that all of that is part of also part of web development and um yeah it's a challenge because you have to find ways to make it effect easy yeah good looking and uh and put it to the standards put it to the stands of the company that one show wants you to build their website so it's yeah adjusting in everything okay there is this one quotation about web development where it says website sells you 24x7 no employee does exactly okay so i'm gonna say what what development is okay guys web development so now you have this internet that was introduced in 1996 i don't need to go through the history but in the 21st century right i just love telling stories okay so don't mind me going all these centuries and all this stuff so internet was born and the internet is kind of like a place where you can promote yourself you can promote your business you can promote almost everything and anything right so now with the growth of the internet and we have almost billions of devices connected to it and now what happened is earlier it was really expensive to have an internet but now we have almost 120 people in here and from all around the world you guys are connected into this phone call why is it because of the internet right so internet does not only allow you to create websites and all this stuff it helps you to get connected and it's all all that that made a global village like made me to connect with david who is in hungary made me to connect with joe who was in us made me to connect with devin made me to connect with everyone in this call okay that's the internet and now with that we got some an opportunity that has grown that we can promote our business we can promote ourselves on the internet so what's the best way to promote yourself a website or connecting on social media like facebook instagram twitter those are all social media platforms that have been created for you to connect so now what you can do is you can create websites for your business that can help you reach global clients global people okay so as joe said there might be a bubble okay he he's a barber in us and he does not have a lot of clients he's getting right so now what a web developer can offer is we can offer him to make a website and help promote his business online and help him get more clients from around the city right now suppose you gotta go for somewhere somewhere okay what do you do you hit up google you go you google that place and that's how you go and what another thing that happens on google is when you search for something like coffee shop get a lot of suggestions right and suppose if your business is there and you have a website it's really easier for your customer to reach out to you or make an order or you know book an appointment so that's how you create a presence and to create that present you gotta know web development not everyone can learn with web development so that's why you guys are here to learn web development and short long story short dating websites that's for development right so we are developing the modern way of communication as well isn't it exactly there we go a modern way to communicate with people absolutely yeah okay david uh share the slides please again okay yeah just a moment yeah okay i think it's your slide again who's a web developer okay who's the web developer he's the person who makes websites like me david joe brendan shrikan gianna elisa rudra devin you guys are all web developers right yes exactly yeah yes okay okay yeah you might be learning web development but you can call yourself web developers no there's no problem in that right okay so we are web developers who create websites right who create solutions modern solutions for businesses right and another thing is not just by learning the web technologies it's not that you only can make websites right now you can create websites you can create android and ios apps with the knowledge of web development you can create what else you can create desktop apps with the knowledge of the developer there is this framework called react to create websites or web applications and with react native react on steroids you can create android and ios app right the best part you want to add something to it yeah and the best part is that it actually is going to be like actual native stuff when you develop and react okay um let's go to our next slide i guess okay so right now we are going to be preparing your ultimate developer and actually profit with javascript environment because we are adding some pwj uh specific stuff into this presentation just for you guys so if you are here and if you're ready to crush it let's everybody get a google chrome and start downloading right now all right let's go and see what we have so we have a couple of uh applications listed up here first thing first uh we got definitely uh first off we definitely have uh vs code you already know that guy um we will actually i'm i mean if you guys guys find it uh useful i'm happy to share a couple of extensions uh just shout it in if you if you guys find it useful okay okay so um by the way this is where i will be showing you a couple of uh in html and css stuff yeah so um david david uh yeah before yeah okay you show about the uh the extensions right yeah uh no not so much yeah okay so guys make sure to if you cannot install all this software right now make sure to note them out and all the vs code extension that david tells you okay so because these vs code extensions will make your life really easy okay so make sure to note them down and make sure to install them to make sure you are ready for all the future coaching calls like we knew a lot of people did not have node.js installed to get started react there were a few people who did not have vs code so make sure to make the best out of this call make sure to note things and do them to get yourself ready for all the future coaching calls okay exactly exactly yeah like these extensions have made even my life super easy and yeah and if you cannot follow up this is a recorded coaching call you will be able to um watch this later on inside of profit with javascript course okay it's going to be in there alright own that um okay and then another thing we gotta say before suppose if people are gonna leave there's this surprise that we're gonna do okay we're gonna ask you people to create and based on your suggestion we are gonna create a landing page okay so this coaching call is gonna be on every wednesday and it's gonna be kinda like a series so today is episode one of season one and next wednesday we're gonna have season no not season two episode two of back to basics so today we're not gonna get into all the coding stuff we're just gonna introduce what's web development and all what html html tags css css selectors and all these tags and then based on that knowledge we're gonna start get into coding from next week okay we're gonna make sure we aren't to all your questions everything your and make you perfect and ready to get into the meat of the program okay so what you're gonna do is you might you you guys keep on visiting websites each and every day right and then you when you visit a website you find wow this website looks amazing right and you all might know websites that are really amazing what we want you guys to do is at the end we want you guys to drop all those websites okay that you find would be really good to create with us in these coaching calls okay yeah like we could create a post in slack and they could just drop it there yeah exactly exactly drop in best websites with a great night user interface a landing page okay youtube because they're not like landing page website they're like application we need a landing page like if you go to slack.com that's a landing page so websites with landing pages make sure to select like free and out of those they're gonna select crate three or five and we're gonna run a poll with you guys and the one that gets the most number of polls they're gonna do make that website with you guys from this from scratch every wednesday okay exactly okay let's go ahead and set up everybody's uh ultimate development environment okay so uh i already started talking about vs code but first where can you get it um of course you will what's up we we will be what software did you open in the beginning uh this is vs code this is vs code okay uh so you can download it by just simply googling up visual studio um code and yeah actually that's the one that you want to download so it's just a simple google search and then the first link is going to be the one that you want to download uh we want to make it like super safe for you so you don't uh uh so you will not be scammed this is the official website of vs code this is where you can go ahead and download it and if you're on windows or linux you can go ahead and install it right from here so once you have it downloaded uh you're going to see a screen like this one uh and you want to go this uh onto this um little where is my screen brush um let me just move this thing yeah so you wanna select this thing this is the extensions um hey david hello yeah i had a quick suggestion to people i know it takes time for us to upload the videos you can also take screenshots and save so you know by the time that will be something handy for you if you want to go back and refer that's what i do if i find something interesting i quickly take a screenshot and save it so i can go back to whenever i want to i don't have to depend on kajabi because it takes a little while for the content to get there just a suggestion okay okay okay okay first up uh first extension uh this is going to be super useful for you uh when you're developing html this is auto close tag um oops i even clicked it so auto close tag is let me let's just go ahead and demo what it does so i'm just going to type in a random html tag let's say strong and i just close it and it will automatically pop in the um the closing deck for it right it just makes you makes your life so much easier uh the other don't think they have that but it's what's okay so that's because of ms bro uh even if you don't have that vs code extension you if you have image working on your vs code then it's gonna work yeah okay next up we will be using auto rename tag right so auto rename tag is if i go again and type here strong and i just uh i don't know i it kind of looks i want to uh rename it for some reason like let's say i want to go with div it already deletes it from the other one from the closing tag and it uh pops in right ahead that's right bro my point exactly yeah yeah this question uh what if we have like multi so you mean i have like three div tags this is what you mean oops yes okay so if i have it i can still go ahead and like i don't know rename it like h1 it doesn't make sense at the moment but it goes ahead and renames it right but it's still um yeah so your names yeah it actually knows which one uh which one closes which one right so it's just going to make your life easy and especially when you're like a beginner uh it's going to make your life super easy because you will not need to worry about like oh my god did i uh close this tag or did i not what happened nope it's going to take care of it even if you go ahead and rename it uh like some random stuff it's still going to update uh as well so it keeps keeps the tag closed so you don't have to worry about any of these stuff okay all clear yeah thank you there perfect now uh i mean guys actually can you follow it follow with uh follow me with this yeah that's my good sense nice nice second one is what are your name yeah what's up so first we should uh download auto close tag and then auto rename which okay don't worry about that um what i'll do is uh once david goes through everything when uh once david finish goes going through all the vs code extensions i'm gonna drop it in the zoom chest and also in the slack okay yeah okay okay i'm gonna go ahead uh share my screen once again and okay so here we are next up we will be learning bracket pair colorizer um this literally does what it says but actually i recommend downloading the second version um there is like nothing super fancy change but obviously they are going to update the second version and they are going to focus on that more so this makes actually more sense when you have a javascript file right i'm just going to go ahead and create an index.js and like i can literally like throw uh don't matter how much of brackets added and it will color all like the pairs okay so if you like have something don't worry about it don't freak out um i'm just going to type wait damn it yeah yeah why you just got changed yeah why just put a bit low oh hold on a moment uh let me let me do a quick sound preference stuff yeah even people on youtube today voices okay uh is it better now yeah no okay okay for some reason drop the volume i don't know okay so uh don't freak out i'm just going to create a an array which will be completely empty and i can just say radar map and if there's something yeah okay just one sec uh classical is asking is there any additional settings needed to enable this effect to take place in the editor no when you install the vs code extension it's automatically gonna set up and it's gonna work for for you suppose there are some settings that you might have changed earlier then it might not work so if it does not work just take a screenshot of it and drop it in the slack channel okay okay uh where's that yeah perfect okay i just threw in some gibberish code this probably like would freak out at the first moment uh don't even try to memorize this but this is just to show you how bracket bar colorizer works so up here you can see uh they've colored it like completely or uh yellow but uh if i go ahead and like delete this one and for some reason like completely forget about it i can already see that the editor is like freaking out like oh my god what's going on it's expecting a closing bracket and i can like oh my god when did i miss it right that's when uh this tool comes in handy uh so i can see that this is like purple one yeah we got the pair of for it blue one nice whoops there is an uh there's like a yellow one and there is no closing so i can just go ahead and close it and everything is going to be uh cool except for i wrote some bad code in here hi david sorry to interrupt but what does the dot map function do exactly uh the dom map is is going through the array don't worry about it for now it's actually covered in the module so if i had like several of these and like there will be something uh the map something would be covering this part this isn't just some gibberish call here just to show you how this is just for time sorry yeah no it's just it's just for demonstration purposes this doesn't even work i'm gonna even delete it okay um yeah let's go for the next uh next awesome what you call the extension that you can go ahead and install uh i think the css for matter is actually very handy it helps me whenever i'm uh like um david david david can you please be closer to the microphone okay how about now don't have mine okay okay okay so uh css formatter actually does what it says uh it's just a simple formatter for random uh css tags so i can just go ahead and like if i have a tag which is strong uh and like i don't know make it or i don't know okay tell me your class name app let's say let's say we i we have an app.header don't worry about it and i don't know uh like display um flags guys okay when we are typing code in here don't freak out ignore what the code is okay you know what's happening here i'm just uh it's for only demonstration purposes i'm going to show you every single thing uh what i'm doing here okay uh this is okay disclaimer don't try out this code what david does sometimes it could be ingenious to your computer okay doesn't prettier do that for you exactly it's the same thing uh so you can go ahead and use prayer as well that's uh actually a lot better it shut it goes ahead and and does all this stuff whenever you're uh saving the file so i could go ahead and if it's still yeah and i'm like uh okay i'm not i haven't configured it but previewer does the same thing uh css formatter is like specified on css what's up um you know why why why do you sound like you have big bass like yeah sound like you're far away from the mic oh still yeah yeah can you change your mic can you change your mic and try okay he doesn't need to change the mic just to come closer to the mic okay how about now i'm going to go ahead yep and how about now oh that's awesome okay we will go with it we will go this way then okay so it just goes and just uh does the uh formatting for you okay uh don't worry about again this code we will be teaching every single thing now another thing i want everybody to go ahead and is uh i think yeah it's visual code in telecode it's just going to give you oh yeah visual studio and telegram yeah that's right yeah uh it's actually going to come handy when you're typing uh javascript so it's like um it's going to give you more uh hints so like when i go like all these start stuff are coming up whenever um when i have this uh intel code installed right it's just giving you more options to choose from and it's going to help you go heading some backend application or you're creating a react application right so you remember npm i express and although all this kind of stuff or for example mpx create react app you know all those kind of stuff those are because we have node.js installed uh on the computer right this is the thing that you want to go ahead and install i think you can go with the lts version um current is like still under development and all this kind of stuff so it actually says recommended for most users don't worry about the other one just go ahead install this uh you can install it on windows as well so it's very it's very powerful yeah this is only for react right no no this is when you're developing for the back end so you are like doing backend development like node.js applications and when you're doing react applications right and there is a lot more uh one more functionality but this is where we are using it okay all clear everybody with me but we we are obliged to uh but we are obliged to install node.js to uh to create uh react up that's right yeah yeah yeah you know so both ways we need it suppose you are just working with html css and javascript you don't need your notepad but if you're going to work with frameworks or you're going to work from with library javascript packages and all this stuff then you're going to need to have no js installed okay exactly okay so come from here can we can we download this node.js from google yeah yeah go to nodejs.org and you'll get it okay let me go ahead and share my screen so uh you can go ahead and just type in nodejs.org and it's going like this is how it looks right so i'm just going to go ahead and drop it in the zoom chat so you guys can have it uh um yeah i just dropped it in you can go ahead and use that link uh to get to this page and you can just go ahead and hit download you will inst you can install it afterwards this call and yeah that's pretty much it about node.js but during installation they don't have to do anything other than click the exe correct exactly i think that's where people were getting that's where people had most questions is when they installed they were getting different errors so you might so just a general uh shout out when you it also depends on the type of pc what softwares you have installed on your pc there might be some issues so that can be you know you can send screenshots or if you run into issues and can do that on an addon oneonone basis so in general you should not um okay um i have a question by aaron saying can you explain how to create a react app so react will be covered on tuesday's coaching call with sunny so today's coaching call is absolutely for beginners and we are not going to cover about all those stuff okay yeah afterwards i have a question yeah yeah okay i have a question regarding the node.js version so usually we need to download the latest version uh the latest support yeah so okay there is this two versions when you go to nodejs.org the latest and the lts right download the lts one and not the latest one because the latest one it's it's like still under development and it's gonna have bugs and all this stuff for normal for you for what do you say normal users yeah for usual users you basically go with the version that has been tested and proven which is the lts version the current version is still under beta phase it's being it's being tested on different environments so it's not solidified yet so you use the lts but i guess the audible version is on the latest one because we're using in the tip calculator the model we use the import statements in node.js the import statements uh can be used in the lts fund too right david i'm not sure don't worry about the uh the other one just go with that that's perfect most stable right exactly it's more stable exactly this is uh the node beams are getting updated every time so is it also good to have nvme what's up the note version manager i mean i keep installing the new node versions and using the nvme i can switch between the nodes what's up okay okay let me tell you okay um guys let me tell you since you're really beginners you don't need to really focus on uh version managers you don't need to worry about you know i need to have all this latest stuff and all this stuff you know just what you need you need to get only the basic stuff in and then you're good to go you don't need to have the latest mpm or the node version to get started you don't need to have the latest you know the beta version of vs we are showing you the basics that you need to get started okay so you don't we don't need to pull go dive into all this nvm or code what it was called don't worry about it just go ahead and install them because later on you will be needing this in the course right that's all you have to worry about now just go ahead install it you will just you can just forget about it afterwards right and you will be just able to uh like go like super uh smooth in the course that's all this school is about helping you out to uh be able to succeed as fast as possible right and just have like a super smooth experience oh cool yeah i i have a small question related to visual studio intel code do we have a specific library for only js keywords kfk1 javascript uh keywords for the the extension that you mentioned it gives us uh multiple words keywords but some of them they are not related to javascript is there a specific tension talking about the intellisense david he's talking about the intelli whatever you're showing remember so he's saying that intellisense is not just javascript javascript specific it gives you whatever nonrelevant javascript as well which is not relevant to javascript i mean it's not always limited to javascript yeah a couple of times it throws up a couple of other stuff but when i mean it intelligent and knows that you're what you're working with and the thing is yeah the thing is you don't need to have everything perfect to get coding okay you don't need to have your intellicode to only show javascript keywords and you don't need to have the latest as i said you don't need this is the basics guys you're just starting and you don't need to fall into all these rabbit holes and you know trying to just get started like download no js install with the lts version download visual studio code install all this vs code extensions and you'll be all good to go and i think they would have somewhat tell you guys exactly thank you okay let's go let's dive in the extensions uh the tools sorry okay next up i highly recommend downloading github desktop because i have it oh yeah so if you already have it that's cool um so github desktop is just making easier for you to understand how gig version control works let me pull it up super quickly um hello yeah okay this is the first time i'm using it so when you're downloading it this is the screen that you will uh actually see right so i can just uh go in here and like i don't know uh coaching portfolio i can just go ahead clone it like it gives you uh the link if you guys are wondering when are we going to use all these tools well we are going to be using these tools in our future coaching calls on wednesday exactly yeah yeah is it going to be a specific coaching call for the front end or like css yeah so okay uh it's this the wednesday's coaching call is gonna be like this today we are just showing you all the tools that you need to get started and everything and the next wednesday based on your polls and everything we're gonna start on with a project like we've already seen a lot of people suggesting strike.com maybe we might do stride.com or maybe the one that suggested the most so based on that before we go on to everything we're going to start with basic html we're going to show you the html tags and then we're going to start the basic structure of the stripe or the website that we choose okay and then the other week we're gonna start styling and then we're gonna be more styling and all this stuff and finally on the day on the final day we're gonna deploy this website on netflix or five or something using git so you're going to be learning git you're going to be learning how to deploy your website you're going to be learning basics of html you're going to be learning about css it's going to be everything so basically it's going have a bit of frontend stuff right yep exactly okay okay so let's go now uh and i'm gonna just show you dude i have a small small question okay yep hello i think javascript intellisense comes default with vs code is that right what's up with vs code yeah everything is right yeah it's built into javascript uh uh vs code right now you know right now you know what i'm going to say yeah now most most of the stuff is okay sorry so most of the stuff is yeah it is coming uh built into uh vs code but if you want to like make uh power it up and like have the ability to be able to see more of those stuff then you will definitely want to go ahead and download um the intellicode as well right it like adds more stuff into that okay that's all it's about okay let's go back to github desktop now um like understanding how that works so boom okay everybody sees it perfect so uh you can just simply create like clone repositories add repositories create new repositories um and you can like fetch whenever you make a chain uh make a change you can just go ahead and push it uh changing branches we will show you guys everything um it's just a demonstration on that it's so much easier than having a terminal open all the time and like typing in stuff stuff like get add had thought and all those kind of stuff because for for the first time it actually uh is super hard to understand how all these stuff work and it's just a very beginner friendly way to start coding so um i'm going to show you where to go ahead and download this so let me look up the stuff from here okay um also david we got a suggestion asking people uh the list of software that we need to install and all this stuff yeah today david yeah we will do a long video after this right after this call and show how to download each tool that you need and how to make it run okay david exactly yeah yeah okay sure actually we can just snap a couple of links in there too but like this is how the page looks like just go ahead click it and you already have okay next up zoom i hope everybody has it because otherwise are you in this call i don't know if you can actually join uh from the cloud david uh yeah uh i have a question related to uh uh like yesterday and the call we uh uh sunny show uh shows us uh that there's a get uh extension and obvious code for get get lunch what do you recommend using github desktop or extension on the vs code and which is but actually i use both personally so i have git lens as well i mostly use git lens to um whenever i have something committed it shows up a couple of icons here so i can like compare what's happened uh since my last commit and i i am able to see uh what did i add and what time so that that would be my recommendation but to actually learn how git works i would definitely uh suggest to go ahead and download github desktop so i would recommend using both right okay thank you hope that helped a lot okay um what did i want to show you you have david you have already done a video on five awesome tools for develop listening youtube right yeah that's correct i mean you can go ahead and watch that too that's more like i mean this is more like profitable javascript uh specific later on we will get to those points as well i mean we're just approaching those oh hold on where is my presentation right here awesome so definitely go ahead and download zoom if you're joined for if you're joined from the cloud okay next up slack you can go ahead and if you don't know about it uh you can go ahead and join to our uh awesome slack community it's vibing and it's full of positive vibes and stuff like that so definitely the slack community right um okay um gianna you had a question this is it so we have the profit with javascript channel we have all this kind of stuff going on uh we have a huge huge introduction um and yeah like everybody is helping everybody like nasser is putting this stuff out here so i highly recommend going ahead and downloading slack and join the community okay um next up what you will be using is postman i think i even talked about this one as well on that live call uh postman you can use it to check uh if your backend apis are working perfectly or not and and if you're a front end if you want to go ahead and like work more on the front end um you can just check what kind of data are you going to grab in from the back end right okay and blue this is called loom you definitely want to go ahead and download loom because for all all this works uh yeah like i have all these stuff going on with all these personalized video feedbacks uh so loom is actually a super easy to use uh tool it records records your screen as well as your camera and it just helps you showcase us how you did your homework right so there will be a lot of times when and i actually encourage everybody to go ahead and whenever you finished a module and you created the project just go ahead shoot a loom video send it to the pwj channel and slack uh post it in our private facebook group and just like hype everybody up to do so right um yeah also another thing that we're gonna do really soon is we have seen a lot of you guys on your own creating really nice and great projects so we're gonna create a repository we're gonna create a new positive where you guys are gonna post this project and make a long video and show awesome okay great yeah okay um now let's go ahead and type into uh html basics i'm just going to show you a couple of tricks tips and tricks what can you do with html um nothing super fancy going oh my god i forgot two super important uh extensions so these two live server and live share thank you okay yeah most important stuff right so liveshare is livestream makes me able to create a link and i could just literally drop in uh drop to amana and he could hop in and we could work on the exact same code we could work on my computer even his he could work on my computer um and we could just like do the pad programming stuff which is super powerful it's going to like skyrocket your skills and all those kind of stuff so i definitely go ahead and download it and the other one is live server which we will be using i think we can go ahead and start using it right now i mean it's super easy to set up you can just go ahead download it and down here it should appear but for some reason oh i'm not in the html5 so whenever i come into the html5 um still not appearing okay um yeah it sometimes freaks out and does some good stuff but put right click right click i think you do right click right click on the live server yes yeah you need to turn it on even show up here no you can go to your documents from the extension side by the document and click live server yeah start replying no no to start a live service should have uh it will also work if you put here right then the first option i didn't even know about this one nice okay so it's super easy it's easier than i thought okay okay here we go okay uh just so i get an idea everybody put your hands up both hands if you uh if you're complete beginner web development and don't even know what html is okay leave what are you doing um everybody with the camera turned off yeah i see muhammad is complete beginner okay so we will be going ahead and just give you an idea of how how it looks like and what is it let me go ahead and share my screen and i'm turning on my screen brush and okay can you guys see the whole whiteboard okay yes okay nice boom so html boom so it's actually uh it's the abbreviation of hyper text markup language if i'm not mistaken and it's basically that is right yeah thanks you're yeah it basically creates the structure of the website whoops yeah so let's let's suppose that we have a website like this and like let's say that we got some sidebar going on here some top bar uh some let's say if it's facebook and we got all these posts going around here we got the chat uh and all those kind of stuff and like let's say this is the like uh this is where comments go this is where this uh text goes now this is the structure yeah so this is the structure of this page right and this is what html does for us it's not going to look nice it's going to be looking ugly without css and all this kind of stuff but it gives damage there's a nice nice gif for that whoa nice gift for that go to go to go yeah go to google and just search um html css javascript okay and go to google images you'll find one okay and i'll show you which one is that uh okay sorry um yeah exactly that one i love that oh yeah yeah yeah that works that works okay is it literally how it is it gives you the skeleton stuff makes it look awesome yeah guys this is how we learn here okay yeah um let's actually create our first we're not going to do anything anything super fancy i'm just going to show you a couple of uh html tags and all those kind of stuff nothing super fancy going on here uh so let's actually everybody open up your vs codes right who's ready who's pumped show a thumbs up nice okay with just a quick question yep so what is the tool that you used to draw those boxes those colorful boxes you made uh it's called screen brush okay thank you uh yeah i'm just gonna drop it in the i think it's a mac only app by the way okay that's why i got a print app on windows and even if that is a paid version right oh i see yeah okay yeah because that gives you gives me the ability for like freezing freezing stuff and i don't know all these i think even i can go you know uh yeah i mean if you go ahead and like search up screen annotation too you will definitely see a lot of them okay let me quickly check how my batteries are okay i'm not sharing my screen sorry guys yeah screen share perfect okay so how can you um okay so this is how you will actually see a uh html file without anything it's going to be empty there's going to be nothing there is one secret uh you create a little symbol that if you type in uh yeah this is going to be an abbreviation and it comes built into your vs code right so if you just type in uh an exclamation mark and just hit return it's going to pop in all this kind of stuff and then you will not you don't have to worry about all these headache right yeah okay david just a just a small introduction interruption kartika is asking can you guys also dive into some prototyping tools where we can get a bit better grip on css okay so before we actually dive into coding the next week we'll try to do something like that right you know david like create a prototype of the website on sigma or wxt and show guys you guys how you prototype and also get a better idea on css yeah yeah yeah exactly that would be helpful thank you no problem guys like this is completely driven by you so we just want to give you as much value as possible okay let's go back to uh creating a super simple nothing fancy uh html file so actually it is running on my 5500 uh port and if i was able to yeah this is my part okay so this is a sometimes uh there are a lot of people who might find it boring but we are doing this actually for absolute beginners so guys guys literally if you enjoy you definitely need to understand all these basics and you have to master these first and then you can jump into react because that's when you will get super powerful okay uh let's make this quick i'm going to create a couple of stuff on my on my screen you can go ahead follow me but the homework is going to be to check out one landing page or something that you like and try to replicate that with plain html right now you don't have to uh worry about styling and all those kind of stuff you can go ahead but don't worry if you cannot just try to make it look like that okay just try to replicate the structure okay so uh we will get this plain stuff going on here i'm just going to add a couple of stuff like i will create a div which will have a class of header uh we are not going to use bam naming for now but when you're working with a client it's highly recommended but just for the sake of simplicity you're not going to use bam and then so there is the header uh we will have like a strong um i don't know let's say a title and like we can create a button in here as well which will say uh click me so i i just want to give you guys an idea of how it all will look like right so we have a strong title up here and we have a button which says click me you can create these by just uh these two stuff right you can also if you want to like make this title like crazy big uh you can wrap this into a h1 oops sorry so you can go ahead and grab wait a minute yeah so you can go ahead and rub these into a h1 and like put these like a round title right that would make it super big i mean not super big but definitely bigger than what it was it also actually inserts a line break right so you have so you need to know all these nittygritty stuff to be able to work with the super efficient level once it clicks it's going to be epic hi head and body shows up yeah uh no i actually i added an exclamation mark that was all that i did and then boom but actually i i think you can type in doc and it's just going to be almost this i mean let's see what's the difference but i always type all the codes manually it never shows up like that like chat and name and all really is there a special extension for that or something yes i mean i have no clue it might not work i mean let's let's hop on a caller let's actually text me uh in the slack and yeah it should be a part if it not like leaf says so i don't know uh let's actually address this issue after this coaching call okay okay okay i have a question related to the what is net vs code so emma is like a tool which which will make you able to do super fancy stuff and like add lots of uh html attacks in just a couple of lines right so i can like i could type in so if i just want to create a div with a specific class name i could just type in a dot and like i don't know i have the app header he's going to pop it in here right so that was a map i i could also do uh this that i want to do we need to configure it no no it's pretty built it should be principal then and that's code okay uh i'll take a look into it and i'm not okay the next thing you can do with the math which is super powerful so you can you can like uh add a url inside of the um inside of the header and inside of the ul you could add a couple of allies let's say you want actually you want to give them a class name of list item and you want uh eight of these with just this one single line of code boom see that i could do oh i'm gonna do it again boom it pops it in i got the div uh with the class name of hatter i got the ul and i got eight of these allies with the class name of list item right how does this class thing work like i have never understood this class and you are completely so class is uh going to be so you definitely want to go ahead and give everything a class name because when you're styling you will be you will uh you will be targeting most of these uh class names right we will be covering it in this series so might be not today but definitely in one of the upcoming calls okay okay and actually one little trick uh which will increase your efficiency so if i go ahead and select class notice that it actually highlights all of them but if i go ahead and click command d on my keyboard it goes all the way down and selects all the classes right and i could actually do it here as well so it selected that one and it goes all the way down and i could like whoops like delete everything and like type hello nine times and it's going to make uh your life a lot easier uh when you're uh when you want to rename a lot of stuff which are not html attacks because of course for html tags it's super easy so that's it so class is basically like a group yeah class makes a class helps you to like target the target the tag and whatever is inside so it makes your life easier um when you're styling and when you're doing some kind of javascript stuff okay let's dive back okay so what we had was the title which was a h1 and we had a button and i also want to create another div which will be i don't know let's actually use them right now so we will be so i want to have a list of like let's say students let's say i want to have a list of all the students in this uh on this website right so i could create a div oh i could create a div which will have a class name of students list just to put it in perspective and i will have an unordered list which is ul where i actually could make an ordered list as well which is in a while and then i'm adding allies which will have a class name of student and because i say c83 i'm not going to edit the three of these i'm just going to go with five for now so i can just randomly pick uh five people out of this class so we got swan okay let me let me just put holy yeah so we got swim we got three we got uh oops we got gianna we got uh joe and we got um aaron congrats me david because you're another student see no it's a student list whoops and if i go back to my okay page boom there we go right um so it created an ordered listing the difference between the ordered and unordered list let me show you what is it uh so if i go ahead and change this like notice that it already highlighted and i change it to ul which stands for unordered list it changed the numbers to these bullets right so it's kind of just giving you an idea of how how all these html attacks work you could also like create um so if i wanted to add a link to everybody's facebook profile let's say i wanna wrap swann's profile and i wanna help uh help you guys find swim super easily because when is an awesome success coach uh we could just add an a is uh what does this a stand for by the way anchor egg anchor thank you um snap in whatever link you have it's like let's go and say google.com for now and i'm copying someone putting him here and just in a moment there we go uh it's not going to google because i haven't had the hdtv doing good that thing so now should be just to add david david just to add when you do a ul versus ol i think ul sorts the elements um alphabetically i believe can you do that can you go turn it back to our ordered list of course sure yes so people can know the difference these are the subtle differences that you should be aware or it doesn't i think it just uh no no i think it just adds like a number and that's all right yeah so these are like super easy uh and then like super beginner friendly tags that you can go ahead and like try yeah pre you're welcome of course i'm putting your name there um okay so these are like just to give you an idea of how all these tags work um one uh actually if you give type that uh another dot order list uh uh they like it will give you the specific type of it like whether if you give like orderless with capital a then the list gonna be creating with the capital a's and if you give like a star then the unordered list will be created with star as a bullet point yeah yeah yeah exactly okay um now this is only just to give you an idea of how all these tags work now one everybody um i think the best source for learning how uh to go with these hdmi stuff is we3schools.com uh and and like this thing is like showing you all the documentation right so obviously we couldn't cover it uh on this coaching call definitely but i want everybody to go ahead and create that web page and if you guys have a question like come to us well we are happy to help you and we are happy to give you hints on how you can go ahead with all these uh html ethics right by the way was it informational uh did you guys find it useful or should we go into uh into it deeper or i mean for now uh it's going to be like a touch base but definitely next week and afterwards we will be going into this super dupe okay oh cool give me a thumbs up nice awesome okay i'm just going to show you how show you guys uh to give you an idea of css and what it does so notice that we had a class here okay so um by the way uh i remove this sidebar on the left hand side it's a command b so i can go ahead and say that let's say i want the whole thing to have a green background so i can go ahead type in body and background color and i want it green right is it clear so i have this tag over here right i'm targeting the body tag and i'm setting the background color to green i think it should work for some reason it doesn't maybe it's because i think the dark body what's up oh i didn't link the two okay dark body no no yeah that's another thing uh yeah emma helps with this too you just go ahead type in link and it's going to type in this line of code but we are uh with beginners today so let's go ahead and type in links i thought i thought it was only me who used to forgot linking css files so we can see one professional mod developers also forget it's their third part yeah yeah okay uh so you can just go ahead and open up the link tag like type in rail and that is going to be style sheet so you want to define that that the type of it is going to the style sheet the href is going to be um style css i think yeah let me just close it i actually noticed that link doesn't close up it's because link doesn't have a pair right that's all there are a couple of uh tags that work like this so now that there we go okay now that it's uh connected we have it green okay now another thing uh class so notice that i just typed in body over here nothing super fancy but let's say i want to target all the students i'm just going to hit a dot because this is a class right so remember whenever i'm giving uh class name to a div i'm starting with a dot you can remember it from this thing so let's say i'm going to target the students and i don't know i want to make font font white uh to 900 front white uh makes your font super bold okay let's see what we did there we go it made we made the form super bowl uh we could also uh actually i'm going to remove the class name from here from swamp and save it again and notice that it's like so much lighter but because it's another color it might not be the best example so i'm going to remove it from pre too see so if you if like it's noticeable and gemma is bold pre is light okay that's uh that's how these glasses work but i could uh add the glass at any time whoops and i can say student and pre is going to be bold again all clear everybody everybody with me who's with me yeah sharpies or a tumblr or something nice yeah boxing is a possibility too okay just kind of push myself you know i think yeah okay so that was kind of like to give you an idea of of how these styling stuff work it's really nothing super deep for now i actually want everybody to go ahead and start messing with this like literally go to some web page and you can like snip it apart with the inspect tool it will show you everything um i can show you that too um let's see how it looks like um i have a question like the other another page how did you link this page with the background color like you had this you have both files in your same folder yeah yeah i have them in the same folder that's actually a really good question you need to have all these files in the same folder we're not going to use javascript today uh noted i created a folder called back to basics which is yeah that's the name of the folder and i have two files in it you can actually go ahead and create like random files like another html with some i don't know it's another html file so it actually adds you can create folders inside here like this is how we create the uh model and all those kind of stuff with sign right and when you're so when you have selected model uh you can add like this is where all the uh model files come right that's kind of how how we add all this stuff okay so is it like the whole page where you start doctype html it's your folder and then you created this stylesheet which is filed within that folder right uh nope actually doctype is in the file which is already in the folder so i when when i created this project i just had the folder then i had to add index.html which in which i just pressed uh the exclamation mark and that added all the stuff for me okay so basically these both are the files within one folder and which is connected to each other by that style exactly okay got it okay so um this is kind of like giving you an idea of how this stuff work and how these things look like i actually want everybody to go ahead like try to mess with these try to like make your hands dirty jump in ask questions use the community okay you have an awesome community to use uh we're always there to help you so use it as an opportunity to grow as fast as possible right and just drop all those questions okay how do we submit homework uh great question from aaron uh you can shoot a loom video like actually i want everybody who is a beginner and who is using html first today to go ahead download loom and shoot a little video that okay guys i learned this today um this is my first project using html and i don't know like just say some stuff what you learned and what was difficult and all this kind of stuff just drop it in pwj channel okay and then we submit it in select channel yeah just drop it in let's drop in the sock channel when people are going to react and all this kind of stuff okay uh it's time to ask answer questions um let me go ahead and share my screen again uh can you go with the homeless one with that real quick uh what sorry coming here oh i was saying um yeah but now the homework can go just create some random webpage doesn't have to look nice it doesn't have to look anyhow just create something make your hands dirty and start messing around with html and css that's all i think yeah david a great place to start on you know messing up with html is uh you can share free code cam.org before we go any further uh i wanted to show you one more thing uh where you can like where everything is super easily on this like okay um so these two videos probably already know who is smiling over here oh hold on okay so you probably already know this guy this is kazi from kevinprogrammer.com and fuzzy cozy yeah he actually made two of these awesome uh awesome videos these will actually walk you through all these uh with all these stuff obviously couldn't fit into this uh coaching goal because it's like four hours in total it keeps them more than four hours so but i definitely i if you're a super beginner i highly recommend going ahead and checking these out this should be enough for you to get your hands dirty and start going ahead and create something what's up absolutely yeah can you share the links um yeah of course it's on youtube yeah it's on youtube it's on youtube um we'll just pop it in like uh into um into slack whenever you're when we are finished okay yep okay okay time to answer answer questions oh yeah here we go what's up q a yeah q a okay let me just refresh the slido oh we got 40 questions nice jesus why bro are the yellow ones uh oh these are the these how to have a cool cool hair like david grow it exactly including okay which one did we already answer come enough it's more like your turn i think yeah let's go from the first one yeah okay so casey has asked how do you set up websites to be mobile friendly better to start that way or fix it after a normal build okay can you shout if you're here okay see casey left okay in case casey is watching this back uh if you're a beginner i would definitely don't worry about mobile styling for now when you kind of messed around with html css and all this stuff uh that's when you want to go with mobile friendly there are other sources for that to find how to make mobile friendly and how you want to go about that but for if you're a beginner for now i wouldn't worry about it if you're not a beginner um i always go but go like make everything uh flexible and mobile friendly and like i should be able to see the webpage uh perfectly as i'm developing it right so by design it should be flexible yeah i think like making uh you can uh if you're like really constrained on time and all this stuff you can go for a css framework which are creative mobile friendly you know so you don't have to spend time on media queries trying to make it mobile friendly because if you're going from scratch and trying to make websites mobile friendly it's a way too much of work like you gotta say okay for this for this size you gotta say uh we need to you know make this this and this look like this like it's gonna take a lot of work if you're going from scratch but you can try using something like you know css frameworks or something yeah so leave it beginner just try to get it working there we go this has a good point right intermediate add some yeah yeah deep i need yourself go ahead bro that was pretty much all i had to say you're a beginner just try to get it working it's hard enough as it is trying to figure out everything don't take on that battle right now just try to learn the basics when you're an intermediate level add a little bit of flexibility as best you can just to get a feel for it you'll find out pretty fast um i have one more question like almost as a big navy hold on i'm almost done advanced mobile first always because everybody has these and somebody most people nowadays less and less people use tablets or desktops mostly it's like tablet or phone yeah but that's it go ahead could tell yeah but you had a question uh yeah like there are so many basic things like in htmls it's like so many basic things and there are so many software nowadays like bootstrap and all which help us to skip all those basics so like how does this work david what happened uh i think i froze maybe it's in a nice pose what okay hold on am i good man you look good okay yep you're good uh yeah brother can you repeat that same question again yeah uh like in html there are like so many basic stuff where we use a different tag to style in html but nowadays a new thing like bootstrap and all which help us to skip all those steps and directly use the bootstrap to design our webpage right so like how does this thing work like do we need to learn all just all the basic things or like we can start learning bootstrap i mean i would recommend learning the basics first um because then you will be able to use these tools much more efficiently exactly because bootstraps you can use it anyways but if you don't have a good understanding about the basics you're gonna struggle in the long run like suppose you don't know much html css and you know you go for bootstrap and you find it really easy to set things up and everything suppose you come off face a client say not used in a framework you're gonna struggle a lot having a basic knowledge and going for a framework that's completely okay but without having a good knowledge or at least some understanding of how this works going for a framework is not always a good idea that is correct that is correct suggestion yep yes to answer his question i was watching one of the live calls from tatyana and she suggested something called a mobile rwd extension for google chrome i think that would be really useful if you want to design it for mobile and the pc simultaneously like you guys can use the bootstrap grid system at the start like like you're making some cool things right now so at the start you can use bootstrap grid system to make it look like responsive but do not use the complete bootstrap like do not just put every
