00:00 - and also we have a cat to everyone yeah
00:11 - in this video I want to share with you
00:13 - guys
00:14 - our team vision and also want to share
00:16 - with you guys like the team themselves
00:18 - what we are trying to do is create a
00:20 - community of Python freelancers that
00:23 - earn an income and that's a very
00:26 - specific goal that we have so you can
00:28 - see we have like a small team but we
00:30 - have our hearts into this and we have a
00:33 - very awesome vision and every day
00:35 - literally we come up with so many ideas
00:37 - and you have to write them out so this
00:39 - entire place is like Project Mayhem from
00:41 - Fight Club you know all the white boards
00:43 - are just like filled out with crazy
00:45 - ideas of how we can provide you guys
00:47 - with more value and we have some amazing
00:50 - ideas and one of those ideas I want to
00:52 - share with you in this video what we
00:54 - wanted to do was create a program where
00:57 - you could take projects from platforms
01:01 - like Al Broadcom and then we bring those
01:03 - real projects and we create a video
01:06 - course around how you can actually
01:07 - complete that project so let's say we
01:09 - found some project online it had a three
01:12 - hundred dollar market value that
01:14 - somebody was willing to pay for it right
01:16 - now we would take that project and then
01:19 - we would make a video course on that and
01:22 - teach you all the skills that are
01:24 - necessary so let's just say the project
01:26 - was scraping web links from from a
01:29 - website and all the PDF links we would
01:32 - just take that and teach you all the
01:36 - skills that need it so the web scraping
01:38 - skills the Python skills and then what
01:40 - we want is for you to be able to go
01:42 - apply for that job on up work and
01:45 - actually be able to land it because you
01:47 - have all the skills you need and then
01:48 - get paid so some projects might be you
01:51 - know like $100 some projects you might
01:54 - make like $300 and the goal is really to
01:57 - get you started and then eventually you
02:00 - can even land like
02:01 - five hundred dollars projects or a
02:03 - thousand dollar projects each project we
02:06 - build it will say the exact dollar value
02:09 - next to it the screenshot of the actual
02:11 - project from work and the exact skills
02:14 - required to complete it we're calling
02:16 - this the seven step Papa Python
02:19 - freelancing system so our vision is that
02:22 - we actually go get a client you know and
02:25 - take you behind the scenes with us on
02:29 - that journey so we go through we find
02:30 - the client we land the client we do the
02:33 - outreach we do their project we get
02:35 - their invoice and then we actually show
02:37 - you behind the scenes and show you the
02:39 - project we worked on how we reach out to
02:42 - the client the follow-ups that we did
02:44 - the deals that we negotiated how much
02:46 - was the contract for and then the proof
02:49 - of their invoice and we show that to you
02:51 - as well and then in the course we'll
02:54 - obviously show you how to make that
02:56 - project - so each module like that's how
03:00 - we kind of imagine it you know we take a
03:02 - project we land it and then we kind of
03:05 - document the entire thing around it and
03:07 - with this program AWP
03:09 - we want to start to laser focus in on
03:12 - this because we realized we recently
03:14 - made this post on our Instagram and
03:16 - everybody was so excited by it which was
03:18 - all about freelancing what I want to be
03:20 - able to show you guys is how easy these
03:22 - opportunities can be okay so basically
03:24 - like we can go type in and literally
03:26 - click jobs right here you type in Python
03:28 - if we scroll down we'll look for a type
03:31 - of job that looks a little easier so
03:34 - look we want to be able to take a
03:35 - project like this scrape two sides
03:37 - walk me through guys using something
03:39 - like Python and beautifulsoup
03:42 - now what we can do and what we want to
03:44 - do is you want to take a project like
03:46 - this and we want to put like a dollar
03:48 - value on that project like say $300 and
03:51 - then in the course I want to show you
03:53 - exactly how to build this project
03:56 - alright and then you build it and now
03:59 - you can come to this guy and we'll show
04:01 - you exactly how to land him and work
04:03 - with this client
04:04 - and crushing it on up work with Python
04:07 - sober like let's give you guys that
04:09 - skill so this program we're gonna focus
04:11 - on that okay so this is Aaron who is our
04:15 - product specialist so he is the one
04:18 - who's gonna be helping make the content
04:21 - for this course and the main instructor
04:24 - for this program okay and this is
04:26 - Frankie who the our video producer and
04:30 - he's gonna be actually editing all these
04:32 - videos and putting them together for you
04:34 - guys in this module so it's really we
04:37 - are working here together and I'm just
04:39 - the pretty face okay
04:40 - now we're working together in this
04:43 - program to make sure that we give you
04:45 - guys the highest quality material and
04:47 - everything that you guys need to succeed
04:50 - so look if this is something that
04:52 - excites you you are into this vision you
04:55 - like this idea and let's say you haven't
04:57 - joined this program awp yet i encourage
04:59 - you to enroll in this program right
05:01 - click the button below or somewhere will
05:03 - link it on this page and if this is the
05:06 - type of vision you like where we're
05:08 - headed with this you want to be part of
05:09 - this Python freelancing community and
05:11 - start earning an income who knows we
05:14 - might actually even do leaderboards but
05:16 - who's earning the most revenue every
05:17 - week which i think is gonna be a lot of
05:19 - fun and I hope that you enjoy it too but
05:22 - jump on in because we're taking this
05:25 - cohort and we're going for the next
05:27 - three months right we're gonna go live
05:30 - and we're gonna make sure that these
05:31 - guys get the result in that you get the
05:33 - results so if you're on the fence jump
05:36 - on in be a part of this tight-knit
05:38 - community and we're gonna get massive
05:40 - results we're going to find these
05:41 - opportunities together and we're gonna
05:43 - go far so click the button jump in this
05:46 - program the doors close tonight and let
05:48 - love to see you inside
05:51 - [Music]
05:52 - so basically in this system we're gonna
05:55 - show you how to reach out to a prospect
05:57 - interview follow-up with the clients
06:00 - negotiating a deal landing the client
06:02 - completing their project all the way to
06:05 - receiving the invoice

and also we have a cat to everyone yeah in this video I want to share with you guys our team vision and also want to share with you guys like the team themselves what we are trying to do is create a
