10:42 - a hundred thousand dollars a year as a
10:44 - react developer
10:46 - the first step is you have to actually
10:48 - believe
10:49 - that it's actually possible for you that
10:52 - you can get a job
10:54 - so we want to show you a ton of people
10:57 - who are crushing it within our community
10:59 - and winning because there's not enough
11:02 - of that right so when you see
11:04 - you're looking on reddit or stack
11:05 - overflow you don't see
11:07 - people winning so then your mind doesn't
11:09 - believe that it's possible
11:10 - but if you believe that it's possible
11:13 - you can actually make that change
11:14 - in your life so that's why you know do
11:17 - you think that this would be
11:18 - amazing for you and also do you think it
11:20 - could be possible maybe for you

21:08 - go over now all right bro
21:10 - let's jump into this one uh my name's
21:13 - jason
21:14 - and my experience with coding by the way
21:16 - dude this audio is [ __ ] great like we
21:18 - should have audio that's this good
21:20 - is probably about like four months in i
21:22 - totally
21:23 - boot camp and it was pretty good you
21:25 - know i learned a lot of my foundational
21:27 - things i made about three projects with
21:28 - full crud functionality so he is talking
21:32 - about a coding boot camp that he's
21:33 - already had experience with and they
21:35 - built three projects
21:36 - i just don't feel like they look good or
21:38 - like real world applications
21:40 - so uh that's a really common thing right
21:43 - that happens even when people go to full
21:45 - stack boot camps or projects don't look
21:47 - that good or real world
21:49 - so common dude so coming for the job
21:51 - hunt
21:52 - and i think um i joined this clever
21:55 - programming because
21:56 - i wanted to get like real world
21:58 - applications and i looked at the channel
22:00 - and i was like totally amazed and i'm
22:01 - kind of like
22:02 - binge through everything now and just
22:03 - like go through all of those videos
22:05 - um i love all those clone ideas and i
22:08 - think the biggest achievement for me was
22:10 - like
22:10 - totally grasping all these ideas i know
22:13 - a lot of time you guys were saying
22:14 - pattern recognition but beyond that like
22:17 - i actually
22:18 - really like your basic and like simple
22:20 - breakdowns of these
22:21 - concepts because to me like it made so
22:23 - much more sense than
22:24 - what i learned in my coding boot camp to
22:25 - be honest um you guys explained it so so
22:28 - i'm looking forward to that and
22:29 - i really really appreciate this it was
22:31 - such a great experience thank you
22:33 - oh man that's insane jason that is an
22:36 - awesome video testimony if you're here

22:58 - jobs better their lives like i don't
23:01 - know bro like that
23:02 - makes me when i saw those i was like i'm
23:05 - proud to work for clever programmer like
23:07 - i swear to god that's what i thought
23:08 - like when i was going through it though
23:09 - i'm just like i'm proud dude
23:10 - playing experience ever yeah yeah
23:15 - uh mine waleed says
23:18 - we the best team oh yeah dude have a
23:21 - programmer

23:24 - part of the family yep
23:25 - and this is going to be amazing yup
23:27 - totally honest simply sharing great
23:29 - knowledge
23:30 - uh love your guys's positive energy by
23:32 - the way thank you for that
23:33 - uh here's patches i love this one too
23:35 - dude patches of boss
23:37 - there we go
23:44 - more here checking in uh i'm an actor
23:47 - i'm a writer
23:48 - and i was also a bartender up until
23:49 - about six months ago when this damn
23:51 - coronavirus hit so
23:53 - i'm looking for a new opportunity so i
23:55 - decided to take up coding because
23:58 - it's creative and i've always been
24:00 - creative and so i love that about coding
24:02 - dude bartender oh yeah
24:06 - he was a bartender for 11 years insane
24:10 - and now he's switching to programming
24:12 - and look at that project
24:13 - and he was one of those people who's
24:15 - like oh dude i was up till 4am 6am like
24:17 - just
24:18 - coding and not quitting and there's
24:20 - something to be said about people who
24:22 - just
24:22 - never give up because even in coding
24:25 - um honestly that's that's what separates
24:29 - you
24:30 - like a good senior developer from a
24:32 - junior it's just
24:33 - they have the aptitude to keep on going
24:35 - even when they're debugging even when
24:36 - things get tough
24:37 - they don't quit they just keep on
24:39 - pushing guys so it's going to be
24:41 - something which is going to be crucial
24:43 - for every single one of you guys
24:45 - to make sure that you if you get stuck
24:48 - you don't cry you don't
24:49 - freak out you don't like start like uh
24:51 - wondering oh my god i'm
24:53 - doubting yourself you just keep going
24:55 - just like patch now
24:56 - let me know in the comments right now
24:57 - how many of you guys actually
24:59 - have ran into a debugging issue which is
25:01 - random which has lasted longer than
25:02 - three hours and you push put
25:04 - past it and you solve the problem let us
25:06 - know guys
25:07 - yep let us know and um
25:11 - jesus christ dude i just
25:14 - i give up i give up with all these tech
25:17 - issues
25:18 - um all right
25:22 - these are like the weirdest things that
25:24 - have never happened we'll keep going you
25:26 - can see
25:26 - my screen right sunny yeah what's
25:29 - happening
25:30 - um just hold on i'm i'm still alive guys

25:44 - so jazwinder sodie said i sold an an
25:47 - error in eight hours
25:48 - damn that's amazing dude well done um
25:52 - mustafa osama actually dropped a really
25:53 - value point said most of the learn
25:55 - most of my learning comes from debugging
25:57 - dude that's so true
25:59 - honestly all the learning like when you
26:00 - get that gem
26:02 - all those things come from when it's
26:05 - solving
26:06 - that debugging headache like once you
26:08 - sit there spending ages let's say you
26:10 - spent ages on fixing a little problem
26:12 - i can guarantee you that is not going to
26:14 - be the headache
26:15 - like that is not going to be another
26:17 - headache in the future because you're
26:18 - going to have learned so much
26:20 - having run through that again and again
26:21 - and again like it's it that's really
26:24 - where you sort of
26:25 - master that little bit of skill okay
26:28 - right

27:36 - html i love that
27:38 - until two years ago no experience or
27:41 - sorry until two months ago no experience
27:43 - in coding
27:44 - on my css skills partly savvy um
27:48 - and i joined the uh cp five day
27:51 - challenge
27:52 - because i wanted to learn from the best
27:54 - and i've uh i'm a big believer and if

54:22 - rick
54:22 - um you guys energy is insane yup thank
54:25 - you so much
54:26 - here's a react.js developer salary for
54:28 - oh my god bro
54:29 - what's going on it's just insane oh god
54:33 - wow you buy 20 uh canadian
54:37 - dollar donation we're about to break 600
54:39 - dollars in donation this has never been
54:41 - done before
54:43 - looking forward to make more clones and
54:45 - put into my portfolio if i get a chance
54:47 - to join
54:48 - team cp i'll be the happiest person in
54:49 - the world uh we are actually dropping
54:52 - a video today on how you guys can
54:54 - actually apply
54:55 - to work at clever programmer team cp our
54:58 - number one mission this year is to help
55:00 - 5000 people get jobs
55:02 - as a developer whether it's a javascript
55:05 - developer or react developer we don't
55:07 - care we just want you to get a job and
55:08 - make an income
55:10 - and so um we're looking for talent that
55:12 - can actually make
55:13 - full-time content like us because this
55:16 - is one of the best ways to help
55:17 - developers
55:18 - you know and we make content for for
55:21 - everyone so
55:22 - we're going to drop a video on that soon
55:24 - exactly
55:25 - all right so back to the slides guys we
55:27 - told you that the uh
55:29 - entry salary was around 68 000 but your
55:31 - earning potential is a lot more than
55:32 - that so here we have the median
55:34 - of one hundred and twenty thousand and
55:36 - it goes all the way up to one hundred
55:37 - and seventy one thousand
55:38 - but remember kazi said netflix
55:41 - developers get 300k
55:43 - guys like 300k it's insane
55:46 - right so this is why this is this is
55:49 - median right this is like a median
55:52 - if it says median 120 that's better than
55:55 - average
55:56 - because average could be like one guy
55:57 - can be making like five
55:59 - million dollars a year as a react
56:00 - developer which is
56:02 - [ __ ] crazy but average will skew it
56:06 - right
56:07 - median is like what the majority of the
56:10 - people
56:10 - are making like the majority are making
56:13 - this which is ridiculous
56:15 - so nothing is stopping you from being on
56:17 - the high end or even
56:18 - higher than this if you're working for
56:20 - the top companies
56:22 - exactly guys yeah
56:25 - all right so here are the top tech
56:27 - companies that are using javascript and
56:29 - react so you got facebook
56:31 - microsoft linkedin ebay tesla
56:34 - did you guys actually know this by the
56:36 - way let us know that as well
56:38 - groupon netflix google uber or like do
56:41 - some of these companies surprise you
56:43 - like oh
56:44 - my god like tinder maybe some of you
56:45 - didn't know that react was using that or
56:47 - tinder was using react airbnb and paypal
56:51 - these are huge companies guys all use
56:54 - javascript and or react massive value
56:57 - and now what can you do with javascript
56:59 - or react
57:00 - these are the things you guys can do
57:01 - we've touched them on them already
57:03 - native apps web apps like progressive
57:05 - web apps
57:06 - desktop apps using electron which you
57:08 - know
57:09 - visual studio code is actually written
57:11 - with electron
57:13 - yeah how many of you guys knew that let
57:14 - us know in the chat yeah
57:16 - all right and uh you guys can make all
57:19 - types of apps right so whether it's like
57:21 - the beatboxing app you want to make you
57:22 - can do that with javascript and react if
57:25 - you guys want to do

57:28 - if you want to learn how to build the
57:29 - beatbox app we covered it in our profit

61:28 - 60k a year or 80k a year or a hundred
61:31 - thousand dollar a year jobs
61:32 - you know projects like facebook these
61:34 - are the things that people want to see
61:36 - even steven who's a cto who shows up on
61:39 - our live streams he's like hey
61:40 - the number one thing i look for is
61:42 - people's projects and their skills
61:45 - okay yeah airbnb clone
61:48 - we also have the slack clone oh [ __ ]
61:51 - yeah so all of this stuff is going to be
61:54 - included inside the course i'm going to
61:56 - teach you how to build all of that so
61:57 - exciting stuff guys let us know if
61:59 - you're pumped up for that
62:00 - yep abigail thank you for the donation
62:03 - and he says how are those projects
62:05 - different
62:06 - from the projects that we have on
62:07 - youtube so
62:09 - what we're going to be doing is we're
62:10 - going to be going into more detail and
62:12 - behind the scenes
62:13 - with how you can actually build them
62:15 - also they're going to be nice and
62:17 - modularized for you rather than a long
62:19 - four or five hour long video so we're
62:21 - going to be breaking them up and giving
62:23 - you tons of like behind the scenes of
62:24 - react
62:25 - okay and also guys take the amazon clone
62:28 - as an example so you previously saw the
62:30 - amazon clone without the checkout
62:31 - functionality
62:32 - we then went and upgraded it to make it
62:35 - a full ecommerce app
62:36 - so think of it that way if you've seen
62:37 - the netflix phone on youtube think of an
62:39 - extra pumped up version of netflix clown
62:42 - yeah
62:43 - like a super portfolio job ready type of
62:45 - thing right so not just like
62:47 - maybe the front end but you're gonna
62:48 - have full back end the stripe
62:50 - functionality
62:51 - cloud functions ever like the entire
62:53 - mern stack
62:55 - you know how to use mongodb express
62:57 - react and node.js together to build an
62:59 - app like things that can actually really
63:01 - just land you jobs those are going to be
63:02 - covered in detailed
63:04 - uh in profit with javascript just
63:05 - because like on youtube
63:07 - you know people want to see fun content
63:09 - and if we made a video that was like 20
63:11 - hours long
63:12 - people won't see it right so that level
63:14 - of depth is in the program
63:17 - exactly i love this comment by the way i
63:18 - just want to highlight so it's on
63:20 - youtube it says i uh derek
63:22 - coley says i love the way you teach you
63:23 - make it very easy to understand react
63:25 - because
63:25 - i gave up on react two months ago oh wow
63:28 - we pumped
63:29 - again and they're ready to learn more so
63:30 - thank you for this amazing appreciate
63:32 - you eureka
63:33 - and that's an awesome comment thank you
63:35 - that's awesome
63:37 - all right um so guys we'll be launching
63:39 - the course soon now let's jump into
63:41 - today's training and i'm going to touch
63:42 - base on a few of these
63:44 - but mostly just what i want to talk
63:46 - about right is before we even talk about
63:48 - any of that stuff
63:49 - is here's what a simple roadmap
63:53 - can look like for you becoming a
63:55 - react.js
63:56 - developer okay so for example you can
63:59 - see the whiteboard right sunny
64:01 - yep okay so if you
64:04 - are let's say you know let's say you're
64:06 - this person
64:07 - right here oh okay you're this person
64:10 - right here a disappearing human
64:13 - um that's you okay now if you want to
64:16 - become a react developer and let's say
64:19 - you have maybe
64:20 - just a little bit of experience maybe
64:22 - your patch right patch has what three
64:24 - months of experience
64:26 - yep all right so i'll just write patch
64:28 - here right
64:29 - so imagine patch and as you go in your
64:32 - journey we can make this the timeline
64:35 - all right so maybe this
64:38 - sunny let's say realistically if
64:40 - somebody goes hard
64:41 - how long would it take for somebody to
64:43 - land a job whether it's an internship
64:46 - whether it's a junior level developer
64:48 - job they want to
64:49 - land a job as a react developer and
64:51 - somebody like patch who's putting in
64:53 - massive amounts of effort
64:55 - how long would it take them from zeroth
64:58 - month
64:59 - to like when can they land a react job
65:02 - right so in all honesty if you're
65:04 - putting a hundred and ten percent
65:06 - effort guys the range would be between
65:09 - three to six months i would say if
65:11 - you're really
65:12 - crunching like and i'm not talking like
65:14 - you code a little bit you give up and
65:16 - you go to sleep
65:17 - i'm talking like you get those builds
65:19 - out you
65:20 - push and to be honest this could
65:22 - actually even be shorter than three to
65:23 - six months so like
65:24 - putting in that 110 though is an
65:27 - absolute
65:28 - must yeah that's a must
65:31 - so that is insane that if you can land a
65:35 - job between this period right over here
65:37 - between three to six months
65:39 - yep and it's very possible if you're
65:42 - putting in that amount of effort like
65:43 - patch amount of effort i can guarantee
65:45 - you this guy's gonna get the job
65:47 - and i guarantee you that everybody was
65:49 - like you could get a job in three to six
65:51 - months they're
65:52 - gonna be the ones who haven't gotten a
65:53 - job in three to six months or can get
65:55 - one
65:55 - and patch is gonna have a job and the
65:57 - clever programmer family are gonna be
65:59 - the people who have the jobs
66:01 - but like three to six months is a
66:03 - realistic timeline
66:05 - now let's talk about what should we do
66:08 - from the zeroth month right like let's
66:10 - just say this is zero
66:12 - yep uh and this is all months
66:16 - to the three month or six month mark so
66:18 - even tell me like maybe what projects
66:20 - should we have like what should we learn
66:22 - and what projects should we have and
66:23 - i'll like map it out on the timeline
66:25 - okay do so builds builds are
66:29 - huge right the more builds you can rack
66:32 - up in that portfolio
66:33 - the better it's as simple as that that's
66:35 - going to be your number one sort of
66:37 - ammunition
66:38 - when you go to that job interview and
66:40 - you you can like if you literally
66:42 - handed someone a resume with a link
66:45 - to um a little portfolio with all of
66:47 - your builds on right and these are not
66:49 - just
66:49 - pictures these are these are not just
66:51 - like github or repos with like random
66:54 - code in there these are like actual
66:56 - links that lead you to a working
66:58 - live online project yeah even if you
67:01 - literally had
67:02 - a one piece of a4 paper which said
67:05 - hey i'm raphael carzi check out my
67:07 - projects and they click it
67:09 - and they go to that link and check out
67:10 - all the actual projects guys
67:12 - that says a billion words in one that
67:15 - immediately builds trust
67:17 - sunny you know what we should do i'm
67:19 - thinking about this and we should do
67:20 - this probably after the challenge at
67:21 - some point
67:23 - you and i should start applying to jobs
67:26 - live on youtube and on linkedin
67:30 - or like actual and then have people like
67:32 - watch over the shoulder or we could do
67:33 - that in profit with javascript
67:36 - yeah i think i think that would be
67:37 - awesome dude so then we have like a
67:38 - smaller community and on zoom
67:40 - because they can communicate with us
67:42 - what we you and i can do is like
67:43 - literally have everybody
67:45 - who's in profit with javascript look
67:47 - over our shoulder and then we go and
67:48 - apply for jobs and they can lit
67:50 - exactly see how we apply for them and
67:52 - they can follow along
67:53 - i think we could even do that with
67:55 - freelancing sick
67:57 - okay all right down let's [ __ ] do it
67:59 - i'm down okay
68:00 - um so keep going um yeah so
68:03 - number one thing builds right builds are
68:06 - going to be absolutely
68:07 - huge for that progression right now
68:10 - there is something else i like to talk
68:12 - about it's called the 33 rule
68:13 - now most people don't really do this
68:15 - stuff like most people have no
68:16 - idea what this rule is and what most
68:18 - people focus their time on
68:20 - is they kind of sit in the middle ground
68:23 - right and now there's three areas where
68:24 - you need to spend your time
68:25 - one is learning and that's whether it be
68:28 - through tutorial
68:29 - whether it be for reading up on books or
68:30 - something whatever it is that's going to
68:32 - be 33 of your time okay so on your own
68:34 - level
68:36 - so that's on your own level so that's in
68:37 - the middle ground then you've got
68:39 - a third of your time with somebody above
68:41 - you right so whether it be
68:43 - uh learning from us on youtube whether
68:45 - it be learning from us in the coaching
68:46 - course on profit with
68:48 - javascript that's going to be where you
68:49 - want to spend it uh another 30 years and
68:51 - the final third of your time
68:53 - should be spent teaching now whether it
68:56 - be delivering value for absolutely free
68:59 - or whether it be coaching students under
69:01 - you but when as soon as you can teach
69:04 - something for example if you can teach a
69:05 - little bit of react right
69:07 - then you master react you go from
69:09 - becoming a normal developer to somebody
69:11 - who is a insanely good developer exactly
69:16 - and you guys will go to the next level
69:18 - so that 33 rule take notes
69:20 - on it take a picture of this memorize it
69:22 - print it out
69:23 - put it in your like everywhere so you
69:25 - can see it because that's massive
69:26 - actually if you spend 33
69:28 - of your time learning 33 of the time
69:30 - people above you and 33
69:31 - of your time teaching others who are
69:33 - maybe below you now
69:35 - suddenly let's go through the bills and
69:36 - map it out okay so let's just get really
69:38 - specific
69:39 - uh and also maybe with the react basics
69:41 - right so
69:42 - maybe i'll give you just some examples
69:44 - so maybe month one
69:45 - i do my react basics and like i become
69:49 - amazing at the basics or maybe month one
69:52 - i do
69:52 - like spotify clone and then month two
69:55 - like
69:55 - just give me exact detailed steps if i'm
69:58 - patch
70:00 - okay so in fact let's assume patch
70:02 - doesn't know anything right let's assume
70:04 - patch is a complete beginner
70:05 - i would spend my first month nailing
70:08 - the web development fundamentals so html
70:11 - css javascript
70:12 - right learn the web dev fundamentals so
70:15 - one month at least just spend it
70:17 - learning it
70:18 - playing around with stuff seeing how it
70:19 - works break stuff
70:21 - right because when you break stuff you
70:22 - learn from it when you fix it right
70:23 - that's month one
70:24 - then once two and three i would go hard
70:27 - on the builds
70:28 - like i would go hard on building things
70:30 - like the airbnb
70:31 - clone building thing like the whatsapp
70:33 - clone understanding
70:34 - how do databases work how do i connect
70:37 - my app to a database
70:38 - all of those things are going to be the
70:40 - juicy differences and probably somebody
70:42 - who is in the
70:43 - live and whatever and they're like what
70:45 - what makes you qualified to be able to
70:47 - talk about this
70:48 - you yourself have made how much would
70:51 - react and this is a question that sunny
70:53 - like never even shared anywhere publicly
70:55 - but i got them to like kind of share it
70:58 - on one of the live streams just like
70:59 - asked him randomly and he's like oh and
71:01 - he just gave up the answer
71:03 - so how much have you made in like a few
71:06 - years
71:07 - with react so when i started learning
71:10 - react within two and a half years
71:12 - i cleared over two hundred thousand
71:15 - pounds
71:16 - all right so that's what i'm talking
71:18 - about so two hundred
71:19 - slightly at the top quasi just cutting
71:22 - off
71:22 - yep okay cutting okay so let me um
71:26 - go ahead and just pull that a little bit
71:28 - there we go okay so when you say 200 000
71:31 - pounds or can you do the math for me
71:32 - hold on let me actually ask siri
71:36 - convert 200 000 pounds to dollars
71:40 - two hundred and fifty five thousand nine
71:42 - hundred and eighty dollars and thirty
71:44 - two cents
71:45 - okay oh no all right
71:48 - so there we go so that's 255
71:53 - okay that's literally puts you at a
71:56 - hundred k a year
71:57 - right like because you said two and a
71:58 - half years yeah two and a half years
72:00 - so somebody who's making ex like 100 000
72:04 - or more per year as a react developer
72:08 - that's who you're getting this knowledge
72:09 - from you can't exactly it's not just
72:11 - some
72:12 - bs person and how long okay so another
72:15 - question i want to ask you
72:16 - how many years total professionally
72:19 - being paid
72:20 - did you work as a react developer how
72:23 - many total years did you work as a react
72:24 - developer in your entire life like
72:26 - professionally being paid yeah so
72:29 - it's been three i've worked three years
72:32 - in the industry
72:33 - but as a react developer yeah so so
72:35 - three years in the industry as a react
72:37 - developer
72:38 - and i've been coding guys for over just
72:40 - hitting over 10 years now
72:42 - got it got it and in those three years
72:46 - um this is the total in those two and a
72:48 - half to three years this is total amount
72:50 - we're looking at right with react
72:52 - yeah and this is what i want to
72:53 - emphasize right so this is what's insane
72:55 - like
72:56 - do you know how many people said to me i
72:59 - would need to be working
73:00 - for two years just to make about let's
73:03 - say like 40k
73:05 - a yeah 50k yes and if i listen to those
73:08 - people probably all the senior
73:09 - developers who are like pissed
73:11 - yeah and literally the senior developers
73:13 - like that now it's so funny because i'll
73:15 - go and i actually i bumped into like old
73:17 - senior developers when i'm in london
73:19 - and things like that and they're like oh
73:20 - what are you up to now and i'm like oh
73:22 - like what are you on right now and you
73:24 - tell them
73:24 - like as then when you have that
73:25 - conversation it's like if it comes out
73:27 - you tell them
73:27 - like oh yeah i'm on this much they're
73:28 - like what the hell like i've been coding
73:31 - for 10 years and i'm not on that and
73:32 - then
73:32 - but then i've been going for two years
73:34 - and it's all about there's a lot more to
73:36 - it than just the sort of
73:37 - development skills and that's something
73:39 - that you're not going to find
73:41 - elsewhere right so me kazi nas we've all
73:44 - gone through that pain that sort of like
73:46 - failure failure and now we've got a
73:47 - bunch of shortcuts and knowledge
73:49 - that we just want to share that's it
73:52 - exactly
73:52 - that's it we want to try to give back
73:54 - and you know for those of you guys who
73:56 - have known me for a while you've heard
73:57 - my story but
73:58 - i was also making over a hundred
74:00 - thousand dollars a year as a developer
74:02 - and then i found um you know i was like
74:05 - 20 21 and then i at some point i also
74:07 - got two developers
74:09 - who i hired from upwork and then i
74:11 - started managing them
74:12 - to work for my clients and i became the
74:16 - middleman so they would work
74:18 - on the projects and i would make sure
74:19 - they were doing a great job
74:21 - they were delivering for the clients and
74:23 - that put me like at well above the 110
74:26 - or 120 000
74:27 - a year mark around 22 23
74:30 - so that was something that was a
74:33 - valuable experience for me and just a
74:34 - lot of fun
74:36 - yeah dude absolutely crushed and it's so
74:39 - cool because cause he took it slightly
74:40 - different route
74:41 - i took a slightly different route yeah
74:42 - and then we come together
74:44 - and it's like you guys just get the best
74:46 - of both right yep
74:47 - because you guys will get both you guys
74:49 - will get the full time
74:51 - you guys will get like how do you
74:52 - actually get those like insane jobs
74:54 - high-end paying jobs and for me what i
74:58 - can share with you is how can you
74:59 - actually do it if you wanted to go to
75:00 - the freelancing route or maybe how can
75:02 - you supplement your income
75:03 - while you're doing a full-time job right
75:05 - because suddenly you were doing that too
75:06 - at some point you were doing
75:08 - a full-time job and then a freelancing
75:10 - job on the side
75:11 - yeah i mean i was doing a full-time job
75:13 - freelancing on the side
75:14 - and i was teaching students in the spare
75:17 - hours
75:17 - so yeah we showed you how to pretty much
75:19 - do all of that
75:21 - yeah and how old are you sunny 25 years
75:25 - young
75:25 - hey damn so
75:29 - there you go he's not like some 40 year
75:30 - old here telling you
75:32 - how i learned that was actually
75:34 - [Laughter]
75:37 - i don't know where that voice came from
75:39 - um
75:41 - but all right so let's go back back yeah
75:44 - yeah he's laughing
75:45 - so going back to the road map we got so
75:49 - month one
75:49 - i'm covering and crushing my web dev
75:52 - basics
75:53 - month two i build what what exact
75:56 - project should i build the amazon clone
75:58 - or should i build multiple builds
76:00 - right so you don't want to limit
76:01 - yourself to just one go ahead and vote
76:03 - as many as you want so the amazon clone
76:05 - the more the better the amazon clone
76:07 - the netflix clone is going to be amazing
76:09 - to see if i'm in the if i
76:10 - if i'm in the profit of a javascript
76:12 - course and i'm like mastering the
76:14 - web dev basics right yep and then i can
76:18 - go ahead and do the builds
76:20 - exactly okay dope mastering web dev
76:22 - basics do the builds the coaching calls
76:24 - will help you out with that a lot
76:26 - um and yeah i would recommend focusing
76:28 - on getting as many builds built
76:30 - as possible got it and basically do that
76:32 - month
76:33 - two and three yeah exactly
76:37 - those months so you see the majority of
76:39 - the time is actually fixing towards a
76:40 - react
76:41 - and now a lot of people when they're
76:42 - starting out their development journey
76:43 - will end up doing
76:44 - months one two and three purely on the
76:46 - web dev fundamentals i flip it and i say
76:48 - like don't waste your time
76:49 - doing just that just get into jump off
76:52 - that cliff
76:52 - and figure out how to parachute you down
76:54 - okay i like it yeah
76:56 - don't literally like don't just sit
76:58 - there and say oh you know it's too hard
77:00 - to start
77:00 - we will literally hold your hand the
77:02 - entire way and it's and then and you
77:04 - will get it you will understand
77:06 - so many of students are literally
77:08 - crushing it and react is insane
77:09 - it's it's really insane so now i am
77:13 - i've got my web dev basics down i got my
77:16 - second uh i got my bills down in month
77:18 - two and three so let's say i've built
77:19 - like the spotify clone i built the
77:21 - amazon project
77:22 - i built uh my slack project i got like
77:25 - three
77:26 - solid projects done is that enough to
77:29 - start
77:29 - job hunting yeah i would literally start
77:32 - in fact
77:33 - i would actually this is what's crazy
77:35 - right in in the one month one
77:37 - i would tell you to actually start
77:39 - teaching straight away
77:41 - i was asking you to teach right so like
77:44 - you start to teach you can make an
77:45 - income
77:46 - in month one from teaching if you learn
77:48 - how to put a web together a web page
77:50 - together on a very basically
77:51 - other people right yeah teach someone
77:53 - else how to do that
77:54 - and then you can start making money at
77:55 - that point now months after month
77:57 - two you might have built a few builds
77:59 - and you might be comfortable enough to
78:01 - be like you know what
78:02 - let me go ahead and check freelancer.com
78:04 - or fiverr or something like that
78:05 - i might be able to actually pick up a
78:07 - client so at that point you can actually
78:09 - make money on that yep and then a month
78:11 - three you could be like okay i've got a
78:12 - few clients on my belt i've been i've
78:14 - done something now
78:15 - and you can start actually applying for
78:16 - a job like and it's really is
78:18 - possible and it's we've tried it's tried
78:20 - and tested and it works
78:22 - it's very possible guys um yeah like
78:24 - teaching
78:25 - is one of my favorite routes because i
78:27 - think it is
78:28 - lowest barrier to entry you just have to
78:30 - teach somebody who's one level behind
78:32 - you so for example
78:33 - even if you learned like patch right now
78:35 - for example
78:36 - um he and he can do he has just a two
78:39 - months of experience with coding
78:41 - he was a bartender before so zero
78:43 - experience with coding before that
78:44 - but now he's done some basics of web dev
78:47 - and he's built the amazon project
78:49 - he can not he can teach like 70
78:52 - of the people on these online platforms
78:54 - that are looking to get coaching for
78:56 - like learning how to code
78:58 - yeah and platforms like wise and
79:01 - um is a good platform uh if you're in us
79:05 - we have take lessons which is another
79:07 - good one for us
79:08 - uh if you guys are not in us another
79:11 - great one is craigslist
79:12 - so yeah literally if i'm patch i can
79:16 - make
79:16 - posts with uh image like i would make
79:18 - sure that i i put my picture on there
79:20 - because people want to see you just like
79:22 - a smiling picture
79:23 - and then you just talking about you have
79:25 - coding experience and you can teach
79:27 - people how to build amazon project like
79:28 - literally i would write that in my copy
79:30 - for the ad
79:32 - and i promise you you will actually get
79:34 - so many clients from that
79:35 - it'll be crazy i started my career
79:38 - in coding off of i was three months in
79:41 - instead of going the job hunting route i
79:43 - actually
79:44 - um within the first three months i was
79:47 - teaching coding
79:48 - and i started getting tons and tons of
79:50 - clients because i would do crazy amount
79:51 - of outreach i would be like reaching out
79:52 - to 50 to 100 people a day
79:55 - and i was just like disciplined as hell
79:57 - about that i would just like reach out
79:58 - to so many people
79:59 - and i was able to scale my income to
80:01 - like within five to seven thousand
80:03 - dollars or more per month
80:05 - and then i just my teaching alone i was
80:08 - making over 100k a year and then on top
80:10 - of that i was getting software
80:11 - development jobs too like freelancing
80:13 - so yeah that really allowed me to push
80:15 - it over the edge but
80:17 - it depends on you guys right if you just
80:19 - hate teaching really don't want to do it
80:21 - okay don't do it
80:22 - but teaching for me was one of the
80:23 - biggest hacks because
80:25 - what it allows you to do is really it's
80:28 - a hack for you to
80:29 - like learn really fast has that ever
80:31 - happened to you guys where
80:34 - you were teaching a concept to somebody
80:36 - whether it's in coding
80:37 - or anything else in life maybe you were
80:39 - teaching somebody a tip on how to use
80:41 - like
80:42 - their computer and the first time you
80:45 - taught them maybe a math thing or a
80:46 - computer thing or whatever
80:48 - it really clicked in your head and
80:50 - you're like
80:51 - ah that makes sense yeah
80:54 - that's the power of teaching it's really
80:57 - just you
80:57 - learning but on like steroids because
81:00 - when you have to
81:01 - clearly explain a concept to somebody it
81:03 - like
81:04 - instills it in your brain so for me it
81:06 - was just a hack to become a better
81:08 - skilled developer
81:09 - extremely fast exactly but i got you
81:12 - hated
81:17 - guys how about a multiplayer game with
81:19 - javascript just imagine micro payments
81:21 - and going viral with such project rpg
81:23 - style
81:23 - can we do that next please hands up guys
81:26 - hands up if you want to hear that yeah
81:28 - hey that's beautiful that's a sick idea
81:31 - yeah okay dope um
81:34 - so yeah so that's what so if we were to
81:36 - do it again guys
81:38 - even if you wanted to make it extremely
81:39 - basic and you're like i don't want to go
81:40 - to teaching route that's fine first
81:42 - three months
81:43 - do bills web dev projects and all the
81:45 - projects we have already for you on
81:46 - youtube
81:47 - and also in profit with javascript
81:48 - course we go deeper so then those
81:50 - portfolios and those things on your
81:51 - resume will look even more badass
81:53 - and then between months three and six
81:55 - now what do i do sunny like
81:57 - what do what does like let's say patch
81:59 - does all of this what does he do between
82:00 - months three and six
82:02 - right so three and six is pretty much so
82:05 - once you land that job right so let's
82:06 - say you land the job
82:07 - oh you're skipping the you're you're
82:10 - skipping the
82:11 - part so let's say i did three months of
82:14 - builds and learning right now
82:15 - how do i land my job between months
82:17 - three and six
82:18 - right so you would want to set up
82:20 - different so it depends at this point
82:22 - you wanna you need to identify is it
82:24 - going to be freelancing is it going to
82:25 - be a full-time job right
82:27 - two different very different things most
82:28 - people want to go full time so let's
82:30 - address full-time as well okay so
82:32 - full-time
82:33 - there's so many platforms out there
82:34 - right now so hired.com is one that i
82:36 - recommend oh
82:38 - nice okay higher.com yeah i use
82:41 - hired.com quite a lot
82:43 - now hired.com is basically imagine you
82:46 - flip the script with interviews right
82:48 - so rather than that you going and
82:51 - interviewing
82:52 - for all like sending out recruiter
82:53 - emails and all sorts of rubbish like
82:55 - that
82:55 - you just go onto this website literally
82:58 - put in your details
82:59 - and they come to you with offers right
83:02 - so they find you and literally i've
83:04 - landed literally two jobs off the site
83:07 - like and they're very good paying jobs
83:09 - like uh and and they also sent me a
83:10 - bunch of stuff as well like as soon as i
83:12 - got the job they even gave me a little
83:13 - coffee mug and they bought a champagne
83:14 - and a bunch of other stuff
83:16 - and a 300 amazon gift voucher so i
83:18 - couldn't believe it like it's insane so
83:20 - um so companies like this you want to
83:23 - sign up too
83:24 - um i would also recommend signing up to
83:26 - things like yzan
83:27 - and all those takelessons.com just if
83:29 - you haven't already if you're in us
83:32 - yeah if you're in the u.s and guys one
83:35 - thing that all of you guys
83:36 - should be doing without a doubt is
83:39 - recording your entire journey
83:41 - right whether it's on social media or
83:43 - anything like that because that is
83:44 - actually
83:45 - unbelievably powerful yeah because when
83:47 - we said teaching as well
83:49 - we were talking about you can teach
83:51 - through social media
83:52 - right if you write a post that's
83:53 - informative and you say hey here's what
83:55 - i learned today about react
83:57 - right dude that's gonna help somebody
83:58 - else
84:01 - that's going to help a lot of people out
84:02 - i'm going to slap a present we're
84:03 - exactly at 600
84:05 - in chat revenue um dude that's insane
84:10 - let's go oh holy crap
84:12 - [Music]
84:13 - like that is insane
84:16 - wow thank you guys so much for that
84:19 - insane
84:22 - all right my bad i didn't mean to kill
84:24 - your flow
84:25 - no no that's insane dude like literally
84:27 - so now
84:28 - um yeah so after months three i would
84:31 - say
84:31 - pretty much go ahead and start applying
84:35 - so
84:36 - make sure you try and look for those
84:37 - kind of sites they're really really good
84:39 - um but just like kazi said right it's
84:42 - all about that aggressive approach tired
84:44 - is kind of like tinder for developers
84:45 - right it basically just
84:47 - the the other people hit you up tired
84:50 - basically makes you like a hot girl on
84:52 - tinder
84:53 - yeah exactly they just like beef you up
84:56 - literally like make you attracted to
84:57 - employers
84:58 - and then employers will come out and
84:59 - reach you and you just select which one
85:00 - you want that's pretty much
85:01 - literally such a nice experience okay no
85:04 - cruz
85:05 - noel bro crews just dropped a 5 donation
85:08 - he says
85:08 - i had technical issues while getting vs
85:10 - code studio working
85:12 - i was finally able to figure out thank
85:13 - you for sharing your knowledge yes
85:15 - bro thank you that is incredible
85:18 - wow yeah huge yep so tin deaf people are
85:22 - still talking about
85:23 - dev um so there you guys go
85:26 - that is basically one of the
85:29 - clearest road maps you can have to
85:32 - becoming a 100k
85:34 - a year react developer and so
85:37 - it doesn't get any clearer than that
85:39 - guys like this is exactly what you
85:41 - should be doing on month one two and
85:43 - three if it makes sense to you by the
85:44 - way drop in the comments below like does

85:54 - what it takes for you to get hired right
85:57 - and
85:57 - hired.com hencehigher.com and it makes

86:03 - this
86:03 - going to indeed.com and like blast
86:06 - applying to a million platforms whereas
86:08 - here you can stand
86:09 - out now okay so say sunny i
86:13 - appl i apply on hired.com now what
86:16 - happens
86:16 - after that do i just wait or do
86:20 - i you know like go back to working on my
86:23 - coding skills or do i go on linkedin and
86:25 - try to reach out to as many
86:27 - people as i can like what is the process
86:30 - there or
86:30 - yeah yeah so you never want to stop
86:34 - moving guys right so i see a lot of
86:35 - people when they land the job that even
86:37 - when you land the job i see people kind
86:39 - of get
86:39 - into a comfortable place they get into a
86:42 - comfort zone
86:43 - you want to be far away from a
86:45 - comfortable spot like never be sitting
86:47 - in that comfort zone where you're not
86:49 - learning right if you land the job or if
86:51 - you're in the process of getting
86:52 - interviews
86:53 - keep sharpening that blade right keep
86:55 - sharpening that skill set
86:57 - make sure that you can really really um
87:00 - i think i think i don't know who said
87:02 - this quote if you guys know it drop in
87:03 - the comments but basically it was like i
87:05 - think it's abraham lincoln it was like
87:06 - if i've got like i don't know like five
87:08 - days i'm just gonna change the timing
87:09 - but if i've got like
87:10 - a year to um go ahead and cut down a
87:14 - tree
87:14 - i'm gonna go ahead and spend the first
87:16 - 11 months sharpening the blade
87:18 - hey right and then so like it literally
87:22 - is like a powerful quote because it's
87:23 - literally like you want to make sure
87:24 - your
87:25 - skills are dialed in that means signing
87:27 - up to
87:28 - newsletters for react signing up to
87:30 - newsletters for javascript yeah all
87:31 - these things are going to help you stay
87:33 - ahead of the curve
87:34 - yep right like investing in yourself to
87:36 - grow your own skills what i used to do
87:39 - dude that made me
87:40 - a really kick-ass developer really
87:42 - really fast is
87:44 - every single dollar i would earn on my
87:46 - own
87:47 - i would pay developers like on codemen i
87:50 - would go to codementor
87:51 - um which is are you familiar with that
87:53 - platform by the way or no
87:54 - codementor yeah yeah so i would go to
87:56 - literally a code mentor
87:58 - find some developer there so i can
88:00 - actually even show you guys this
88:02 - and i would find another developer there
88:04 - and i would hire them to teach me
88:07 - so say like i worked some job or i like
88:10 - taught
88:11 - clients or whatever and i was getting
88:13 - paid 50
88:14 - an hour so say i worked for somebody for
88:15 - two hours and they gave me a hundred
88:16 - dollars right
88:18 - yep then i'd be like yo i only have like
88:21 - six months of experience
88:23 - of coding i would go online hire a
88:26 - developer from here on demand
88:28 - to teach me like python at the time um
88:30 - but you guys can actually pick somebody
88:32 - who teaches you
88:33 - react or javascript and i would pay them
88:36 - like
88:37 - 50 an hour 70 an hour so essentially i
88:40 - was trading my
88:41 - time and i was just feeding all the
88:43 - money back into them
88:45 - and then growing my skills for free
88:47 - because i knew my skill was the ultimate
88:49 - thing that was going to pay the most
88:51 - yeah so just reinvest every single
88:53 - dollar
88:54 - back into my own skill a lot of people
88:56 - are trying to invest all their money
88:57 - into 401k
88:59 - you uh you guys are trying to invest
89:01 - your money into ir roth ira you guys are
89:03 - trying to invest your money into stocks
89:05 - nobody ever gets rich from any of these
89:08 - things nobody ever
89:10 - breaks out and has financial freedom
89:13 - from
89:13 - any of these things it's complete
89:15 - [ __ ] like most places you look at
89:17 - how they got rich if you ask them
89:18 - how they put so much money into
89:22 - roth ira or their stock portfolios it's
89:24 - from
89:25 - they were doing something that earned
89:26 - them a really high income
89:29 - so focus aggressively on developing
89:32 - one skill that can get you a high income
89:36 - if you look at yourself like a stock you
89:39 - have the greatest earnings
89:41 - on yourself like for example sunny can
89:44 - have two choices right
89:45 - sunny can today put a hundred dollars
89:47 - into the tesla stock
89:49 - let's go back to when you were becoming
89:51 - a developer right you could have had you
89:52 - could have put a hundred dollars into
89:53 - the tesla stock or
89:55 - you could have put a hundred dollars
89:56 - into your own self to learn the skill of
89:58 - react
89:59 - yeah which one would have had like a
90:02 - hundred x
90:02 - return tesla is
90:06 - yeah and also another way to put it guys
90:09 - is
90:10 - what the mindset that we often see and
90:12 - that most of society is trapped in
90:14 - is if i said to you guys or like if your
90:16 - friend comes to your house and says hey
90:17 - like
90:17 - you want to go for a meal today or hey
90:19 - you want to go watch film you're going
90:20 - to go for a night out
90:21 - you pretty much i guarantee most of us
90:23 - will be like yeah yeah yeah let's go
90:25 - right yeah but if i asked you to buy a
90:27 - react a book on react or a webinar about
90:29 - react
90:30 - for 20 or like 10 you i guarantee the
90:33 - conversation would be a lot different
90:34 - you'd be like
90:36 - that's kind of expensive but we would
90:37 - all happily pay like 50
90:39 - on a night out or 100 on the night out
90:41 - you see what i'm saying so like that
90:43 - mindset has to switch
90:45 - in order to achieve financial freedom
90:47 - otherwise you'll never just you're just
90:48 - never going to get there
90:49 - yep like yeah and one of the other
90:51 - things that happens is when
90:53 - you've had that happen right where
90:54 - you've got something for free versus
90:56 - something you paid a lot for
90:58 - and the massive amount of difference
91:00 - between how one of them
91:02 - doesn't do anything for your life
91:04 - because you don't care because it's
91:05 - cheap
91:06 - yeah versus where you paid for something
91:08 - and then you take notes then you
91:10 - actually
91:10 - do everything that's being said you
91:12 - actually go and complete the thing which
91:13 - is why oftentimes like coding boot camps
91:16 - get a success high success rate because
91:18 - if you're investing 10 or 15 000
91:19 - into a coding boot camp you're gonna be
91:21 - serious you're not gonna [ __ ] around
91:23 - like you're like hey i'm committed to
91:25 - this whereas sometimes people just watch
91:27 - you
91:27 - videos on youtube and you know there's
91:30 - like
91:31 - fraction of a fraction of a fraction of
91:34 - people who actually take action
91:36 - right most people are just watching it
91:38 - getting entertainment out of it
91:39 - maybe it's like it they enjoyed watching
91:42 - the content
91:42 - but there's the tiniest amount that less
91:45 - than one one
91:46 - one percent of one percent of one
91:48 - percent that actually goes and builds
91:50 - projects and does these things
91:51 - so when it comes to investing in
91:54 - yourself
91:55 - whether you're trying to invest on code
91:56 - mentor whether you're trying to invest
91:58 - into a coding bootcamp whether you're
91:59 - trying to invest into our profit with
92:00 - javascript course whether you're trying
92:01 - to invest into
92:02 - a book from amazon into react or
92:05 - anything
92:06 - guys please do not be scared of that
92:08 - that is the
92:09 - guaranteed fastest way to get to a
92:11 - hundred thousand dollars a year as a
92:12 - react developer
92:13 - elizabeth who is also a dj and she's
92:16 - like dope as [ __ ]
92:17 - she pops up in her streams her name is
92:19 - future code
92:20 - she's like i don't know is she paying
92:22 - you for coaching
92:24 - yeah yeah so she's actually my
92:25 - one-on-one coach yeah she doesn't i
92:27 - coach her
92:27 - so she's deciding to pay sonny to get
92:30 - one-on-one coaching from him
92:32 - and now she's actually going through
92:34 - like a crazy technical interview and i
92:35 - think she's
92:36 - probably there today and she's in
92:38 - between getting a pretty sick
92:40 - job yeah that's true yeah she had it
92:43 - today guys
92:44 - and yeah i literally do one-on-one
92:46 - coaching with her and she chose to
92:47 - invest in herself
92:49 - right now if any of you guys were on my
92:51 - instagram earlier i actually had corey
92:52 - on there and i'm coaching him
92:53 - as well um so these people are actually
92:56 - they
92:56 - choosing to put money into themselves
92:59 - and i'm telling you those are the people
93:01 - who are going to see
93:02 - those 10x 100x returns yep in the future
93:05 - here's something great i want to
93:07 - highlight okay so here's something that
93:08 - i want to highlight
93:10 - puttvik says are you kidding me twenty
93:12 - dollars per 15 minutes which is what
93:14 - some of the developers are charging on
93:16 - code mentor
93:17 - there's so many other resources to learn
93:19 - let me ask you pudvit exactly how much
93:21 - are you
93:22 - making and i promise you the answer is
93:24 - going to be putvik is making a
93:25 - very very little amount of money i can
93:28 - tell you that
93:29 - right yeah so this is what's called
93:32 - scarcity thinking
93:34 - you think that there isn't enough out
93:36 - there if you go out there looking for
93:38 - the freest resources all you're looking
93:40 - for is like cost and there's only a
93:42 - limit to how much cost you can cut
93:44 - but there's no limit to how much you can
93:45 - earn on the upper side
93:47 - now imagine this on the other hand where
93:49 - so teary is dropping 50
93:51 - or 100 on the donation in just even our
93:54 - live stream
93:56 - right if you have a developer like sunny
93:59 - who can help you one on one
94:01 - he's not gonna be charging you two
94:02 - dollars he's going to be charging you
94:04 - more
94:05 - because his work and his results are
94:07 - worth more
94:08 - if you work with sunny you have really
94:11 - high chances of getting over 100 000
94:13 - a year job but if you go to and learn
94:15 - from somebody who's charging maybe three
94:17 - dollars an hour
94:18 - from india and they're probably also not
94:22 - making that much right so maybe
94:24 - max you'll get a job for ten thousand
94:25 - dollars a year
94:27 - exactly guys so that really really
94:30 - crunches down to investing in yourself
94:33 - and actually
94:34 - i guess the way to put it is valuing
94:36 - yourself enough
94:38 - so that you are saying that to me what
94:41 - patrick's
94:41 - message basically says is he doesn't
94:44 - think
94:45 - he's worth twenty dollars for every 15
94:47 - minutes
94:48 - yeah right if you're not willing to
94:50 - invest that into yourself to learn a
94:52 - skill
94:53 - you think you are not worth or will ever
94:56 - be worth 20
94:58 - per 15 minutes yeah and then that's
95:00 - actually going to be your reality too
95:03 - yeah and you know what dude so many
95:04 - people are brainwashed by like society
95:06 - today like with education system they
95:08 - will happily pay
95:09 - like ridiculous amounts of money for
95:11 - university
95:12 - yep right like insane amounts of money
95:15 - for universities
95:15 - but like yeah like eighty thousand a
95:17 - hundred thousand a year for or
95:18 - you know uh for yeah now dude let me ask
95:21 - you a question like if i
95:23 - if i gave you like let's say i said to
95:25 - you right you have his 80 grand
95:26 - right you have two choices put it all
95:30 - into personal development and courses
95:32 - and all those things or
95:33 - it will literally pay for one year at
95:35 - university what's your decision
95:38 - people will always pick a university
95:41 - most people
95:42 - will because they're used to that but
95:44 - then look at the debt
95:47 - dude somebody who developed puts
95:50 - investment into personal development
95:51 - like
95:52 - you know like it's just results um i
95:55 - invested all into my personal
95:57 - development my skill set
95:58 - i grew really really fast as like a
96:00 - software developer
96:01 - now i'm lucky enough to work with
96:03 - amazing people and be a clever
96:05 - programmer
96:06 - and i dropped out of college because my
96:07 - professor was asking me for
96:09 - career advice and i was like you know
96:11 - i'll probably get out of here but i was
96:13 - investing heavily into personal
96:14 - development
96:15 - my own coding skills i had mentors for
96:18 - like physical fitness
96:19 - i had mentors for like learning more
96:22 - business and marketing skills
96:24 - i would have mentors for really
96:26 - everything and because i was just like
96:28 - i only care about growing my skill set
96:31 - because
96:32 - if you i feel like this right you can
96:34 - test
96:35 - a person and their character if i take
96:37 - everything away from you
96:39 - so who is sunny if i take every single
96:41 - thing physical thing away from you like
96:43 - your mic is gone your cool camera is
96:45 - gone your like instagram account is gone
96:47 - your everything you have if that is gone
96:50 - who are you
96:51 - what do you have what can you do and
96:54 - if you can code and you can make badass
96:57 - apps
96:58 - that's the thing i cannot take away from
97:00 - you yeah
97:01 - and that's the thing that's going to
97:02 - make you really
97:04 - yeah i've never thought of it that way
97:06 - it's a really really nice way of putting
97:07 - it yeah
97:08 - yeah like i'm a big big believer in that
97:11 - so
97:12 - that's why you guys have to change your
97:14 - mentality
97:16 - from thinking about expenses and
97:18 - something being expensive and you guys
97:20 - got to think in terms of
97:22 - value right so if you think in value
97:25 - everything changes
97:26 - you know cause you actually change my
97:28 - mind on some of that and guys this is
97:30 - like a true story right now
97:31 - so i remember i was saying to quasi yo
97:33 - should i upgrade my screen and my setup
97:35 - even the mic
97:36 - right like things like that like i mean
97:38 - cause he went back and forth he was like
97:39 - dude like
97:40 - why are you even questioning it the fact
97:41 - you've been asking for longer than five
97:43 - minutes right now
97:43 - buy the thing it's gonna come back to
97:45 - you right it's an investment in yourself
97:47 - and ever since then ever since we've
97:49 - started doing that things are really
97:51 - they grow things are going much better
97:52 - like you you're much more efficient with
97:54 - your time
97:55 - so don't even waste five minutes on the
97:57 - decision
97:58 - if it's gonna if it's something an
98:00 - investment in what you love and what you
98:01 - think that you believe in yourself to do
98:03 - then go ahead and jump and do it yep 100
98:07 - like i cannot stress this enough like if
98:10 - there's
98:10 - one hack you're looking for to become
98:13 - rich if there's one quick tip which is
98:16 - what a lot of people are looking for
98:17 - is aggress as aggressively as you can
98:20 - invest in yourself to grow your skills
98:24 - be religious to skills money is a
98:27 - lagging indicator of your skill and the
98:30 - value that you bring
98:31 - so i'm going to say this one more time
98:33 - it's really important for you to
98:34 - understand
98:35 - money hold on
98:39 - so this stuff right here right this
98:42 - whatever it is this is a lagging
98:45 - indicator
98:46 - of my skill and the value that i can
98:49 - bring okay so now
98:51 - if i can only clean your floors
98:55 - in your house you're gonna be like okay
98:57 - bro here you go like
98:59 - you did a good job today here's like 20
99:02 - bucks
99:02 - okay great now i got 20 bucks
99:06 - but i learned the skill of actually
99:07 - cleaning the floors i if i even clean
99:09 - them
99:09 - really really well maybe you'll give me
99:11 - like a five dollar tip and you'll be
99:13 - like hey bro
99:14 - here you go here's 20 bucks and then
99:16 - here's a five dollar tip and you're like
99:17 - boom there you go right
99:19 - but now on the other hand let's say that
99:23 - you're actually developing an app let's
99:25 - say you're serving the app to
99:27 - millions of people like tinder and
99:29 - you're helping change
99:30 - the world you're helping people have
99:32 - kids getting married
99:33 - match make on an app like tinder or
99:36 - hire.com or whatever
99:38 - now you are providing crazy amount of
99:41 - value
99:42 - right but then you hire me i'm your
99:43 - react developer and i have to now
99:46 - turn your tinder app or whatever uber
99:48 - app into a reality where it can help
99:51 - millions of people now i can bring you
99:54 - so much value it's crazy
99:56 - you're gonna be like bro you're just
99:59 - gonna let you you'll be like here's a
100:00 - hundred bucks
100:01 - here's another 20. here's another just
100:03 - take everything like take
100:04 - it all because what you're bringing for
100:06 - me is changing the entire world and i
100:08 - get to make a lot of money
100:09 - and i can grow my business and i can
100:11 - help people so here you go like this is
100:13 - not anything to me like does that make
100:15 - sense guys like
100:16 - it's just money just a lagging indicator
100:19 - of skill and value so if you spend all
100:22 - your time on the skill
100:23 - and value they can provide to people
100:26 - then as you do that
100:27 - months or years later then you can get a
100:29 - lot of this
100:31 - but if you think extremely short term
100:33 - and you do everything that gets you
100:34 - money right this second
100:36 - and you don't invest in your skill and
100:37 - you do part-time uber and you spend
100:40 - all this time doing like crappy jobs
100:41 - that don't let you work on your skills
100:44 - then this is what you get right now and
100:46 - this is also what you get in the next 10
100:48 - years
100:48 - if you can eat [ __ ] and focus just on
100:50 - your skills
100:51 - you will get nothing right now i'll give
100:53 - you zero dollars right now
100:54 - but then here like maybe you can make
100:56 - like hundreds
100:58 - you know of dollars or more and that all
101:01 - goes to you
101:03 - yeah dude that's so powerful money is
101:06 - a lagging indicator if you think of it
101:08 - that way it really just
101:10 - rewires your brain in some sense yep
101:12 - right like
101:13 - it's true because most of us like we get
101:15 - paid a certain amount and we're like
101:16 - that's my worth
101:18 - it's not your worth it's a lagging
101:19 - indicator i will prove that to you
101:22 - i will prove that to every single person
101:26 - who here here's a here's a very basic
101:30 - example of money being an indicator of
101:32 - value
101:33 - okay take a look at this how long have
101:36 - we been live
101:38 - one hour and 41. okay how would you guys
101:41 - like to make 609
101:43 - per 1 hour and 41 minutes would you guys
101:46 - like to make about 600
101:47 - an hour that's insane yeah we're about
101:50 - 300 let's just say 300
101:52 - an hour would you guys like to make that
101:53 - yes or no
101:55 - how is this happening and this is just
101:56 - donations we're not talking about
101:58 - anything else why is this happening
102:02 - the value that like sunny
102:06 - and clever programmer team right we are
102:08 - working hard to provide value to
102:11 - millions of people millions every single
102:14 - day our stream ends
102:16 - we have these messages in our own slack
102:18 - team it says
102:20 - 151 days of watch time a hundred days of
102:22 - watch time 200 days of watch time you
102:24 - know what that means
102:25 - every two or three hours we help
102:28 - move the world forward by 200 days by a
102:31 - hundred days
102:33 - so we're providing massive value up
102:36 - front
102:37 - right so then it's really easy for
102:40 - us and for to justify
102:43 - 300 an hour or more just and that's just
102:45 - donations
102:47 - you can do the same thing exactly
102:50 - that's why like i want you guys to get
102:52 - out of the mindset of something is
102:53 - expensive
102:54 - only think in the mindset of what can i
102:57 - do right now that can make
102:59 - me so damn valuable like
103:02 - whatever our course is right profit with
103:04 - javascript whether it's 300
103:06 - or 500 or 900 doesn't matter what it is
103:10 - but if you were to invest that and on
103:11 - the other side
103:13 - there's a potential for you to make
103:15 - thirty thousand
103:16 - or fifty thousand or a hundred thousand
103:19 - dollars or more per year
103:23 - are you really losing money right are
103:25 - you really losing anything
103:26 - or not just our course right if you're
103:28 - investing in somebody else's course on
103:30 - udemy or their own platforms or whatever
103:32 - it is
103:33 - it's an investment in yourself so i just
103:35 - want to make sure that
103:37 - you guys know how valuable you are
103:40 - and that you are your biggest investment
103:42 - and asset
103:44 - exactly and guys investing is not just
103:47 - monetary right
103:48 - it's not just money when we're talking
103:50 - it investing your time
103:52 - as well is also a huge investment like
103:55 - if you're waking up late going to sleep
103:57 - late you're not really getting much done
103:59 - in the day
103:59 - right like you're wasting so much like
104:02 - valuable time
104:03 - that could be dedicated investing and
104:05 - learning where you can invest this stuff
104:07 - into yourself
104:07 - so even if you don't have the money as
104:10 - such
104:10 - you can start that transformation right
104:13 - now
104:14 - by changing the way that you spend your
104:16 - time
104:17 - wake up early get that sleep in before
104:20 - and don't stay up late watching netflix
104:21 - every day
104:22 - like those subtle changes or what leads
104:24 - to you
104:25 - then improving as a person improving
104:27 - your skill set that builds up your
104:29 - monetary value because you're going to
104:30 - be able to do more with your time
104:32 - and then you can do what kazi said so
104:34 - you can start right now
104:35 - regardless if you have the money or not
104:37 - and guys if you want to start right now
104:39 - and actually this

117:03 - in eight months if i start learning data
117:05 - structures and algorithms today
117:08 - i would say learn the actual stuff which
117:10 - matters dude
117:11 - like uh don't worry about data
117:12 - structures and algorithms worry about
117:14 - building
117:14 - uh actual apps so building things like
117:17 - the clones
117:18 - that's gonna be more of a chance of how
117:20 - you're gonna get hired by fang
117:21 - as opposed to data structure and
117:22 - algorithms exactly
117:26 - how dev roy says how i can mix my skill
117:30 - of
117:30 - javascript with react
117:34 - um okay i think he's saying java i think
117:36 - he's saying
117:37 - java would react okay so i actually came
117:40 - from a java background
117:42 - so um to help you out there dude just
117:44 - start
117:45 - right so honestly just start you use the
117:47 - resources use clever programmer
117:49 - use proper javascript use w3schools um
117:53 - learn how to google honestly so it'll be
117:55 - a huge benefit to you
117:56 - and yeah freaking learn yeah i think
117:59 - googling will be killer

out of all the other chrome tabs or any distractions that you have open put your phone on do not disturb or better yet put on airplane mode and let's kind of just jump right into it exactly and before

much glad to be here i will land my developer job thank you for that 20 pound donation marcin that is massive yeah that's huge dude all right guys so let's go through some of these okay so we're going to show you some of the wins the students are having as well so check out like the wins and these are real wins right like ojawa yesterday was like this community here is like someone just handpicked amazing people across the globe carefully and group them together insane community love you guys we have this [ __ ] changed my life somebody sent that as a message priyansha says i'm only 13 i live

dude what i knew raphael says i'm really feeling more like a coder now her deep says kazi or son you're the best teachers i swear for real and nas they capture your focus in a jar and lock it damn and throw away the key samuel kabuska says just arrived from work straight away to code haven't slept third day but it's worth it please be patient and slow for tired guys like me thanks damn holy crap what a boss um frankie says oh thank you raphael for the five dollar donation wait was that yeah thank you raphael and um frankie came in sanchez and he says guys i'm a senior backend developer oh nice i always avoid the frontend skills because i never found a good way to learn you are on another level congratulations many companies would use this method for teaching i never thought i'd be loving react.js and doing my own projects dude i think we should be doing that soon man like we should be pushing enterprise level teachers yes a hundred percent what we should do is focus on helping everybody get jobs as developers and then help and then at their jobs help train their companies that would be sick that's awesome yeah sharing says you guys have revolutionized the learning experience to a new level to everyone thank you j sean of react and papa python thank you and zachary who dropped a 50 donation yesterday said so pumped to accomplish my why and become my own boss and live a real life that's dope dude wow jean pierre with the 25 donation yesterday said gratitude to you guys for getting me excited about software development again you guys are such a blessing yo this is awesome and then this uh siddharth said he wants to give a gift for his mom for her birthday coming up and uh he wants to learn the skills so then he can get a job so then he can afford the gift for his mom so that's sick amazing dude and guys this is as real world as it gets right like these are real people landing real world jobs from our projects that they're like learning to do right so for example we have jen here and she goes right at the end of the live call i got a phone call with a job offer at almost twice what i used to make so she was making like forty something thousand and this job offer was for ninety six thousand a year and she goes they mentioned one thing that really impressed them was the covet tracker this is the cova tracker she actually built inside of the profit with javascript um program and she goes we're learning real world projects that land real jobs yeah and just to give you guys some background on jen jen was actually she lost her job due to cover 19 right so she lost her job due to cover 19 but she turned that crisis into an opportunity and she doubled her salary which is insane guys so give it up for jen in the comments i think that is massive absolutely massive guys um all right we got a bunch of people here so that was jen sumit over here said oh this guy's sick dude they actually reached out in my dm's really this was during my dms go ahead yup he said uh he actually i actually put him on a live stream today so samit is based in boston right and he went on a holiday to new york city and while he was there he landed a sixfigure job at mathworks as a web application developer so what he did is he went ahead and built the netflix and the spotify clone and it was the spotify clone guys that he actually demonstrated to um his employer actually oh my god dude i just saw that holy crap we'll cover that in just a sec but like he literally guys he demonstrated that to his employer and landed a goddamn uh sixfigure job like it blew my mind i brought him on a chat today i had a i actually spoke to him he showed me proof insane stuff that's crazy that's crazy and i love that he actually even showed proof for it because we always want to see that thank you guys we just got some epic donations from you guys uh jen for ten dollars says thank you i want to change my profession from 20 years chef to a programmer and let's go because thanks i don't know javascript i'm learning a lot just giving me a head start beautiful and ganesha's dropped a 20 pound donation so thank you so much for that as well dude don't you love it how we see so many different professions move into the fields yep bartender from patch got a chef who's turning into programming that's insane insane dude i love seeing that and this was frank you guys who dropped a 100 donation a few days ago and he says guys i just landed a sixfigure consulting project for sonos to make their new react and react native radio station product they hired me based on the spotify clone i built using sonny's live video on youtube i'm so incredibly grateful for clever programmer team guys how sick would that be if you landed a job with sonos if you landed a job where you were making a hundred thousand dollars a year as a react developer the first step is you have to actually believe that it's actually possible for you that you can get a job so we want to show you a ton of people who are crushing it within our community and winning because there's not enough of that right so when you see you're looking on reddit or stack overflow you don't see people winning so then your mind doesn't believe that it's possible but if you believe that it's possible you can actually make that change in your life so that's why you know do you think that this would be amazing for you and also do you think it could be possible maybe for you exactly and guys this is like why we build this community so that you you don't you can actually see that it is possible not through us but through the actual results like these are people who've landed jobs from the clones that we built and the sort of people in the course it's insane it's really really insane 100 yep so um and then prince got his first job today on upwork and for 400 just because of spotify clone so that is freaking awesome and yesterday something else amazing happened where raja was like hey kazzy i got my third project within 20 days earned almost 5 000 and i was like hey give us some proof because i'm like maybe it's like not real or i don't know i just felt like from his message i'm like maybe it could not be real because somebody else like joked with us earlier and i was like okay and then we saw and he sent us proof from fiverr and look at this he got a thirty seven hundred dollar project that says thirty seven hundred i don't know if you guys could see it but that's freaking awesome right would you guys right would you guys like to have cleared 3 700 from coding or from a react project yeah like how cool would it be guys if you could have that same view right now on your computer and see a seven hundred dollar project all right oh nice donation by jumada thank you they say keep changing lives haven't done the challenge but love you all thank you for being here even if you haven't done the challenge that's okay guys we're just glad you're here yeah and now we

really want to spend more time with my little son dude oh he wants to do it because he wants to spend time with his little son that's why he wants to code by the way daniel and everybody in the comments is like hey done we're signing up amazing surya great job awesome and tech ahmed awesome yep great job so and his project is looking really good by the way i'm proud to say excited for join to the profit with jscrip course and obviously i already applied to the profitable shortcut and be part of your goal of interest in the back oh no watch this okay this part is freaking sick okay now

well hey boom boom dude that's his own music thanks for all your inspiration holy crap that's insane oh man that's so sick i thought you cued that oh yeah when i initially watched it i was like wait was that us so guys give it up for luis that was freaking awesome great job with you guys thank you all right we're gonna now see uh jason also had an uh amazing experience uh with us working with us so i'm gonna play that for you guys that is awesome i know a lot of you guys have submitted them we won't be able to go through all of them but uh there are some that we can definitely go over now all right bro let's jump into this one uh my name's jason and my experience with coding by the way dude this audio is [ __ ] great like we should have audio that's this good is probably about like four months in i totally boot camp and it was pretty good you know i learned a lot of my foundational things i made about three projects with full crud functionality so he is talking about a coding boot camp that he's already had experience with and they built three projects i just don't feel like they look good or like real world applications so uh that's a really common thing right that happens even when people go to full stack boot camps or projects don't look that good or real world so common dude so coming for the job hunt and i think um i joined this clever programming because i wanted to get like real world applications and i looked at the channel and i was like totally amazed and i'm kind of like binge through everything now and just like go through all of those videos um i love all those clone ideas and i think the biggest achievement for me was like totally grasping all these ideas i know a lot of time you guys were saying pattern recognition but beyond that like i actually really like your basic and like simple breakdowns of these concepts because to me like it made so much more sense than what i learned in my coding boot camp to be honest um you guys explained it so so i'm looking forward to that and i really really appreciate this it was such a great experience thank you oh man that's insane jason that is an awesome video testimony if you're here right now thank you for sending that through that is amazing dude and also akeem just dropped a 5 donation oh thank you for that man i freaking love this like this is the thing that for me makes it real like yeah where they go from comments to like actual like oh my god these are like real human like these are people who are using this to get jobs better their lives like i don't know bro like that makes me when i saw those i was like i'm proud to work for clever programmer like i swear to god that's what i thought like when i was going through it though i'm just like i'm proud dude playing experience ever yeah yeah uh mine waleed says we the best team oh yeah dude have a programmer is the best team all of you guys are part of the family yep and this is going to be amazing yup totally honest simply sharing great knowledge uh love your guys's positive energy by the way thank you for that uh here's patches i love this one too dude patches of boss there we go more here checking in uh i'm an actor i'm a writer and i was also a bartender up until about six months ago when this damn coronavirus hit so i'm looking for a new opportunity so i decided to take up coding because it's creative and i've always been creative and so i love that about coding dude bartender oh yeah he was a bartender for 11 years insane and now he's switching to programming and look at that project and he was one of those people who's like oh dude i was up till 4am 6am like just coding and not quitting and there's something to be said about people who just never give up because even in coding um honestly that's that's what separates you like a good senior developer from a junior it's just they have the aptitude to keep on going even when they're debugging even when things get tough they don't quit they just keep on pushing guys so it's going to be something which is going to be crucial for every single one of you guys to make sure that you if you get stuck you don't cry you don't freak out you don't like start like uh wondering oh my god i'm doubting yourself you just keep going just like patch now let me know in the comments right now how many of you guys actually have ran into a debugging issue which is random which has lasted longer than three hours and you push put past it and you solve the problem let us know guys yep let us know and um jesus christ dude i just i give up i give up with all these tech issues um all right these are like the weirdest things that have never happened we'll keep going you can see my screen right sunny yeah what's happening um just hold on i'm i'm still alive guys so okay but don't move that as much so let's go have a look we got uh loads of people still joining if you haven't already joined links in the description make sure you add that webinar guys so jazwinder sodie said i sold an an error in eight hours damn that's amazing dude well done um mustafa osama actually dropped a really value point said most of the learn most of my learning comes from debugging dude that's so true honestly all the learning like when you get that gem all those things come from when it's solving that debugging headache like once you sit there spending ages let's say you spent ages on fixing a little problem i can guarantee you that is not going to be the headache like that is not going to be another headache in the future because you're going to have learned so much having run through that again and again and again like it's it that's really where you sort of master that little bit of skill okay right okay so what i'm gonna do is um my tvs back up okay great fantastic another donation by sri charon where he says with little full stack experience i'm grateful for you guys for making me pumped up to complete the amazon challenge halfway but super excited go on dude you can do it keep pushing and i guarantee you'll make it to that finish line i'm not sure if it's a challenge now for other people anymore i really think it's a challenge for us dude yeah same dude honestly the amount of tech that goes into it yeah okay we're back up and running hey let's go guys shout out to the team uh nas and frankie just helped my life out and my air horn is not playing anymore either all right great um okay so those were some great experiences here's another one ivan submitted one which is freaking awesome oh actually let's finish patches because i think patches is really good so um my experience in coding up until about two months ago was virtually nothing so i hopped on a couple classes got my html i love that until two years ago no experience or sorry until two months ago no experience in coding on my css skills partly savvy um and i joined the uh cp five day challenge because i wanted to learn from the best and i've uh i'm a big believer and if you want to learn something and do it right you just gotta throw yourself to the [ __ ] world let's go patch the hard way um and the achievement i'm most proud of is definitely making this here amazon hell yeah i'd be proud of that too bro i've yet to deploy it i'm still working out a couple bugs but rest assured i will get there um you know dude i like his style and it pays off right like other skills that he has of like being an actor and stuff like you can see it and his communication skills are so damn good you know take days off or do whatever i need to do but dude in two months building this that's sick but i really enjoy coding i'm having a lot of fun with it it's very frustrating as we all know but uh i will not super excited to uh see what happens next and i'm gonna steal your line quasi i love your [ __ ] beautiful faces and i'll see you soon hey let's go dude that was phenomenal guys if you guys enjoyed that with patch gave it up for a patch that was freaking awesome nice dude i don't know why it's going all bad quality right now oh i think for you so that's fine all right guys we're gonna look at one last video experience that i thought was really really cool and then with that we're gonna get into the rest of the training uh that we have planned for you today so here is one also from ivan and in the back you guys can see that he has of course this one okay um you can see in the back he has the um amazon project open yep hello there my name is ivan hernandez and i've been coding for three and a half months and ooh another relatively new coder what's your guys's experience by the way he's been coding for three and a half months i want to know like what overall is the experience of everybody who's here yeah i joined because i just wanted to push my limits and definitely i did um i was uh not super successful but very successful within my own limits and i was able to finish that's all that matters except the deployment part couldn't figure out as much but i'm very happy and very proud of what i achieved a lot of people are saying six months four months two years six months two months 14 days damn sort of that's brand new and i can taste like we also got no rash in the comments dude he says brother i'm just 12 and i earn 103 136 dollars this month by teaching coding like you nice great work that's phenomenal i love people who do that that's sick it's a great way to earn an income from teaching coding growing and we're going to touch base on that a little bit bro and keep growing and uh i really enjoy joy having this challenge it was a great experience it pushed me so flintstone in my career and like really byebye guys this was awesome uh if you haven't submitted your video experience yet go ahead and do that if you're in the facebook group the air table will still be there for you to upload your video experience and how you enjoyed the challenge sunny and i will be pretty much reacting and looking at every single one of them so still not too late and it's the only way to be considered for the prizes such as winning the six thousand dollar online coding bootcamp at cleverprogrammer and working with us exactly guys make sure you submit those portfolios and submit those um that form and we'll get back to you with some video feedback yep so make sure you guys do that because we definitely love to see we don't definitely love to just see that it gives us so much like we just love it you know the human interaction is what is um amazing to see all right guys now today for agenda for today's ex training share

so day one's experience was absolute fire we had 11 000 comments on the first post alone which is insane guys and we showed you how to build your react.js portfolio which a lot of you guys now have and you show off and and show to everyone because this is day two day two was insane crazy we had massive engagement and then we went ahead and done day three and four well we built out the remainder of the app so this was an insane experience let us know guys if you enjoyed this experience did you guys have fun oh yeah did you guys enjoy this yeah let us know how did you like it yeah did you have fun during this or was it was it really boring yeah like could be really boring too but i think that it was a a lot of fun but we definitely want to know what you guys think all right let's go this was the day three experience where we built the amazon we were building the amazon clone day four experience guys where we added the stripe and all that functionality and today is day five your road map to becoming a six figure react js developer so i hope that you guys are pumped and excited so now guys remember with react right it's one of the most popular things and javascript is actually the most popular language right in the world and this is according to stack overflow and with javascript and react you guys can make things like facebook facebook is actually done with react you guys can make android or ios apps like this with react native and you guys can actually even build server apps like netflix which we actually showed you how to build and by the way netflix front and engineers make 300 and 6 000 a year or more so that's pretty crazy would you guys like to make 300 6000 or more a year it would be nice then you can be like so teary and just donate like hundreds of dollars and it won't make a difference in your bank account literally won't even done the wallet yep so here's your earning potential as a react.js developer if you are you know getting a job in mountain view california 65 an hour or you're getting a job in u.s to be honest and if you do the math here 65 an hour multiplied by how many what is this eight why is it eight out of the week oh twentyone weeks uh twenty yeah twenty days in a week a month a month and then right that by twelve that's a hundred and twenty four twenty five k much 125 k guys insane got it i was like dude how many eight days in a week what is happening here yeah but yeah that's your essentially earning potential guys as a react gs developer and look at this frontend developer salaries within one year or over 63 000 a year or more so even if it was your first year and you got a job for about 60 000 that would be pretty insane and right now this is pretty insane because we just broke dollars over donation and we just got another 20 donation by chris cavern you guys are insane we love you guys oh my god this is insane go ahead without much development experience i had the worst feeling of uh of imposters these builds are so empowering thank you for rebuilding mine and the confidence of the developer community let's go thank you chris kevin for that amazing donation just insane dude god all right oh my god this makes me want to cry and laugh at the same time and i want to show this presentation and i hope no tech goes wrong i mean there's so much going on guys stop spamming the chat i will personally block you blocked somebody just got blocked in the chat please guys keep it clean we love you but just don't spam it because then it becomes a bad experience for everybody else and we love everybody so we want to keep it a clean experience all right so guys now whatever market you're in right it doesn't matter like you can be in any country in the world but you can still get jobs in u.s and canada and germany united kingdom u.s right is average salary for a javascript developers around six thousand a month and if you're react it's probably more canada is about four thousand a month germany's about four thousand a month united kingdom is about three thousand a month so it doesn't matter where you are in the world these are big enough markets for you to get a job in honestly for most of you can get a job in u.s no problem doesn't matter if you are in the us or somewhere else exactly guys and we mentioned on the next side so can somebody demand the chat on youtube frankie because nobody's being blocked or anything i'm having to do that yeah i just blocked someone as well so guys please don't spam it yeah like we just picked two huge donations from one from kyle potter five pounds he says hey guys thanks for all the work you do currently a test engineer looking to be a full stack dev how can i join without facebook so yeah go on guys the answer i was just gonna say that kyle potter says how can i join so that webinar that we have you don't even need to be part of the facebook group you can just click the link in the description below and jump on that webinar that's also when we're going to be announcing the doors opening to profit with javascript and sharing amazing case studies and results of other students crushing it and that is one thing you guys don't want to miss out on because we're going to be closing the doors to profit with javascript as well because what we like to do is we like to take a few students work with them get them incredible results just close the doors and not allow anybody new to come in and then a few months later open the doors again and then start getting new people's results as well because if we try to work with too many students you can't get them results so we like to work with fewer students and get them results so kyle jump on that webinar and definitely jump into the course profit with javascript as well you're going to be blown away yeah also i want to say a big shout out to rick felix yeah he says five dollar donation you guys are amazing thanks for the energy and the inspiration thank you all of you guys and especially rick um you guys energy is insane yup thank you so much here's a react.js developer salary for oh my god bro what's going on it's just insane oh god wow you buy 20 uh canadian dollar donation we're about to break 600 dollars in donation this has never been done before looking forward to make more clones and put into my portfolio if i get a chance to join team cp i'll be the happiest person in the world uh we are actually dropping a video today on how you guys can actually apply to work at clever programmer team cp our number one mission this year is to help 5000 people get jobs as a developer whether it's a javascript developer or react developer we don't care we just want you to get a job and make an income and so um we're looking for talent that can actually make fulltime content like us because this is one of the best ways to help developers you know and we make content for for everyone so we're going to drop a video on that soon exactly all right so back to the slides guys we told you that the uh entry salary was around 68 000 but your earning potential is a lot more than that so here we have the median of one hundred and twenty thousand and it goes all the way up to one hundred and seventy one thousand but remember kazi said netflix developers get 300k guys like 300k it's insane right so this is why this is this is median right this is like a median if it says median 120 that's better than average because average could be like one guy can be making like five million dollars a year as a react developer which is [ __ ] crazy but average will skew it right median is like what the majority of the people are making like the majority are making this which is ridiculous so nothing is stopping you from being on the high end or even higher than this if you're working for the top companies exactly guys yeah all right so here are the top tech companies that are using javascript and react so you got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay tesla did you guys actually know this by the way let us know that as well groupon netflix google uber or like do some of these companies surprise you like oh my god like tinder maybe some of you didn't know that react was using that or tinder was using react airbnb and paypal these are huge companies guys all use javascript and or react massive value and now what can you do with javascript or react these are the things you guys can do we've touched them on them already native apps web apps like progressive web apps desktop apps using electron which you know visual studio code is actually written with electron yeah how many of you guys knew that let us know in the chat yeah all right and uh you guys can make all types of apps right so whether it's like the beatboxing app you want to make you can do that with javascript and react if you guys want to do you know and this is by the way covered if you want to learn how to build the beatbox app we covered it in our profit with javascript course which will actually be launching in two days not next week in two days uh if you guys want to learn how to build the twitter app right would you guys actually like to learn how to build the twitter app all right and go from what's on the left hand side to what's on the right hand side if yeah then if you want to learn how to build this we build it in our profit javascript course which we'll be launching in two days yep it's pretty sick and here are all of the things you'll learn how to build inside of profit with javascript as well and in detail like netflix clone you'll learn how to build the airbnb clone the zoom clone how do you build spotify how do you build slack from scratch and how do you build facebook from scratch imagine this on your portfolio guys yeah and imagine guys being able to add all of this to your portfolio and then have coaching calls with myself with nars with the rest of the cp team and that experience and the apps are it's just like no boot camp touches that honestly no i've like i've seen boot camps i've been to a bootcamp this doesn't touch this they do not touch this guys this is like next next next level stuff which is why you see so many of the people who are submitting their video experiences and they're like i'm not taught this in a boot camp yeah um so guys we have over 1200 people registered for this training right now so make sure you guys sign up there right hey who is here oh nice dude quasi here right so you guys see all these people there are already chatting here they're in here and we got over 1277 registrants and they're like hey what's

these trainings yeah really really awesome uh somebody asked uh can we can you remote work for the usa with the react yeah doesn't matter where you are in the world guys if you know react you learn react you can be anywhere in the world and tap into any market us uk canada anything you can do it you just need internet so exactly so take a look at this i think it's working now so take a look at this right we have registrants from all over the world like look at that that's amazing dude literally from everywhere so guys make sure you jump in we're getting a lot of people joining from youtube

days from now awesome so let's continue with this epic training that we have for you okay boom so um now these are all the projects you're also going to be learning inside of profit with javascript as well so netflix clone facebook clone and guys these are all the projects you should be putting on your portfolio so whether you're going to join profit with javascript or not just take this out of it put projects like these on your portfolio that's how you're going to be able to get those 60k a year or 80k a year or a hundred thousand dollar a year jobs you know projects like facebook these are the things that people want to see even steven who's a cto who shows up on our live streams he's like hey the number one thing i look for is people's projects and their skills okay yeah airbnb clone we also have the slack clone oh [ __ ] yeah so all of this stuff is going to be included inside the course i'm going to teach you how to build all of that so exciting stuff guys let us know if you're pumped up for that yep abigail thank you for the donation and he says how are those projects different from the projects that we have on youtube so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going into more detail and behind the scenes with how you can actually build them also they're going to be nice and modularized for you rather than a long four or five hour long video so we're going to be breaking them up and giving you tons of like behind the scenes of react okay and also guys take the amazon clone as an example so you previously saw the amazon clone without the checkout functionality we then went and upgraded it to make it a full ecommerce app so think of it that way if you've seen the netflix phone on youtube think of an extra pumped up version of netflix clown yeah like a super portfolio job ready type of thing right so not just like maybe the front end but you're gonna have full back end the stripe functionality cloud functions ever like the entire mern stack you know how to use mongodb express react and node.js together to build an app like things that can actually really just land you jobs those are going to be covered in detailed uh in profit with javascript just because like on youtube you know people want to see fun content and if we made a video that was like 20 hours long people won't see it right so that level of depth is in the program exactly i love this comment by the way i just want to highlight so it's on youtube it says i uh derek coley says i love the way you teach you make it very easy to understand react because i gave up on react two months ago oh wow we pumped again and they're ready to learn more so thank you for this amazing appreciate you eureka and that's an awesome comment thank you that's awesome all right um so guys we'll be launching the course soon now let's jump into today's training and i'm going to touch base on a few of these but mostly just what i want to talk about right is before we even talk about any of that stuff is here's what a simple roadmap can look like for you becoming a react.js developer okay so for example you can see the whiteboard right sunny yep okay so if you are let's say you know let's say you're this person right here oh okay you're this person right here a disappearing human um that's you okay now if you want to become a react developer and let's say you have maybe just a little bit of experience maybe your patch right patch has what three months of experience yep all right so i'll just write patch here right so imagine patch and as you go in your journey we can make this the timeline all right so maybe this sunny let's say realistically if somebody goes hard how long would it take for somebody to land a job whether it's an internship whether it's a junior level developer job they want to land a job as a react developer and somebody like patch who's putting in massive amounts of effort how long would it take them from zeroth month to like when can they land a react job right so in all honesty if you're putting a hundred and ten percent effort guys the range would be between three to six months i would say if you're really crunching like and i'm not talking like you code a little bit you give up and you go to sleep i'm talking like you get those builds out you push and to be honest this could actually even be shorter than three to six months so like putting in that 110 though is an absolute must yeah that's a must so that is insane that if you can land a job between this period right over here between three to six months yep and it's very possible if you're putting in that amount of effort like patch amount of effort i can guarantee you this guy's gonna get the job and i guarantee you that everybody was like you could get a job in three to six months they're gonna be the ones who haven't gotten a job in three to six months or can get one and patch is gonna have a job and the clever programmer family are gonna be the people who have the jobs but like three to six months is a realistic timeline now let's talk about what should we do from the zeroth month right like let's just say this is zero yep uh and this is all months to the three month or six month mark so even tell me like maybe what projects should we have like what should we learn and what projects should we have and i'll like map it out on the timeline okay do so builds builds are huge right the more builds you can rack up in that portfolio the better it's as simple as that that's going to be your number one sort of ammunition when you go to that job interview and you you can like if you literally handed someone a resume with a link to um a little portfolio with all of your builds on right and these are not just pictures these are these are not just like github or repos with like random code in there these are like actual links that lead you to a working live online project yeah even if you literally had a one piece of a4 paper which said hey i'm raphael carzi check out my projects and they click it and they go to that link and check out all the actual projects guys that says a billion words in one that immediately builds trust sunny you know what we should do i'm thinking about this and we should do this probably after the challenge at some point you and i should start applying to jobs live on youtube and on linkedin or like actual and then have people like watch over the shoulder or we could do that in profit with javascript yeah i think i think that would be awesome dude so then we have like a smaller community and on zoom because they can communicate with us what we you and i can do is like literally have everybody who's in profit with javascript look over our shoulder and then we go and apply for jobs and they can lit exactly see how we apply for them and they can follow along i think we could even do that with freelancing sick okay all right down let's [ __ ] do it i'm down okay um so keep going um yeah so number one thing builds right builds are going to be absolutely huge for that progression right now there is something else i like to talk about it's called the 33 rule now most people don't really do this stuff like most people have no idea what this rule is and what most people focus their time on is they kind of sit in the middle ground right and now there's three areas where you need to spend your time one is learning and that's whether it be through tutorial whether it be for reading up on books or something whatever it is that's going to be 33 of your time okay so on your own level so that's on your own level so that's in the middle ground then you've got a third of your time with somebody above you right so whether it be uh learning from us on youtube whether it be learning from us in the coaching course on profit with javascript that's going to be where you want to spend it uh another 30 years and the final third of your time should be spent teaching now whether it be delivering value for absolutely free or whether it be coaching students under you but when as soon as you can teach something for example if you can teach a little bit of react right then you master react you go from becoming a normal developer to somebody who is a insanely good developer exactly and you guys will go to the next level so that 33 rule take notes on it take a picture of this memorize it print it out put it in your like everywhere so you can see it because that's massive actually if you spend 33 of your time learning 33 of the time people above you and 33 of your time teaching others who are maybe below you now suddenly let's go through the bills and map it out okay so let's just get really specific uh and also maybe with the react basics right so maybe i'll give you just some examples so maybe month one i do my react basics and like i become amazing at the basics or maybe month one i do like spotify clone and then month two like just give me exact detailed steps if i'm patch okay so in fact let's assume patch doesn't know anything right let's assume patch is a complete beginner i would spend my first month nailing the web development fundamentals so html css javascript right learn the web dev fundamentals so one month at least just spend it learning it playing around with stuff seeing how it works break stuff right because when you break stuff you learn from it when you fix it right that's month one then once two and three i would go hard on the builds like i would go hard on building things like the airbnb clone building thing like the whatsapp clone understanding how do databases work how do i connect my app to a database all of those things are going to be the juicy differences and probably somebody who is in the live and whatever and they're like what what makes you qualified to be able to talk about this you yourself have made how much would react and this is a question that sunny like never even shared anywhere publicly but i got them to like kind of share it on one of the live streams just like asked him randomly and he's like oh and he just gave up the answer so how much have you made in like a few years with react so when i started learning react within two and a half years i cleared over two hundred thousand pounds all right so that's what i'm talking about so two hundred slightly at the top quasi just cutting off yep okay cutting okay so let me um go ahead and just pull that a little bit there we go okay so when you say 200 000 pounds or can you do the math for me hold on let me actually ask siri convert 200 000 pounds to dollars two hundred and fifty five thousand nine hundred and eighty dollars and thirty two cents okay oh no all right so there we go so that's 255 okay that's literally puts you at a hundred k a year right like because you said two and a half years yeah two and a half years so somebody who's making ex like 100 000 or more per year as a react developer that's who you're getting this knowledge from you can't exactly it's not just some bs person and how long okay so another question i want to ask you how many years total professionally being paid did you work as a react developer how many total years did you work as a react developer in your entire life like professionally being paid yeah so it's been three i've worked three years in the industry but as a react developer yeah so so three years in the industry as a react developer and i've been coding guys for over just hitting over 10 years now got it got it and in those three years um this is the total in those two and a half to three years this is total amount we're looking at right with react yeah and this is what i want to emphasize right so this is what's insane like do you know how many people said to me i would need to be working for two years just to make about let's say like 40k a yeah 50k yes and if i listen to those people probably all the senior developers who are like pissed yeah and literally the senior developers like that now it's so funny because i'll go and i actually i bumped into like old senior developers when i'm in london and things like that and they're like oh what are you up to now and i'm like oh like what are you on right now and you tell them like as then when you have that conversation it's like if it comes out you tell them like oh yeah i'm on this much they're like what the hell like i've been coding for 10 years and i'm not on that and then but then i've been going for two years and it's all about there's a lot more to it than just the sort of development skills and that's something that you're not going to find elsewhere right so me kazi nas we've all gone through that pain that sort of like failure failure and now we've got a bunch of shortcuts and knowledge that we just want to share that's it exactly that's it we want to try to give back and you know for those of you guys who have known me for a while you've heard my story but i was also making over a hundred thousand dollars a year as a developer and then i found um you know i was like 20 21 and then i at some point i also got two developers who i hired from upwork and then i started managing them to work for my clients and i became the middleman so they would work on the projects and i would make sure they were doing a great job they were delivering for the clients and that put me like at well above the 110 or 120 000 a year mark around 22 23 so that was something that was a valuable experience for me and just a lot of fun yeah dude absolutely crushed and it's so cool because cause he took it slightly different route i took a slightly different route yeah and then we come together and it's like you guys just get the best of both right yep because you guys will get both you guys will get the full time you guys will get like how do you actually get those like insane jobs highend paying jobs and for me what i can share with you is how can you actually do it if you wanted to go to the freelancing route or maybe how can you supplement your income while you're doing a fulltime job right because suddenly you were doing that too at some point you were doing a fulltime job and then a freelancing job on the side yeah i mean i was doing a fulltime job freelancing on the side and i was teaching students in the spare hours so yeah we showed you how to pretty much do all of that yeah and how old are you sunny 25 years young hey damn so there you go he's not like some 40 year old here telling you how i learned that was actually [Laughter] i don't know where that voice came from um but all right so let's go back back yeah yeah he's laughing so going back to the road map we got so month one i'm covering and crushing my web dev basics month two i build what what exact project should i build the amazon clone or should i build multiple builds right so you don't want to limit yourself to just one go ahead and vote as many as you want so the amazon clone the more the better the amazon clone the netflix clone is going to be amazing to see if i'm in the if i if i'm in the profit of a javascript course and i'm like mastering the web dev basics right yep and then i can go ahead and do the builds exactly okay dope mastering web dev basics do the builds the coaching calls will help you out with that a lot um and yeah i would recommend focusing on getting as many builds built as possible got it and basically do that month two and three yeah exactly those months so you see the majority of the time is actually fixing towards a react and now a lot of people when they're starting out their development journey will end up doing months one two and three purely on the web dev fundamentals i flip it and i say like don't waste your time doing just that just get into jump off that cliff and figure out how to parachute you down okay i like it yeah don't literally like don't just sit there and say oh you know it's too hard to start we will literally hold your hand the entire way and it's and then and you will get it you will understand so many of students are literally crushing it and react is insane it's it's really insane so now i am i've got my web dev basics down i got my second uh i got my bills down in month two and three so let's say i've built like the spotify clone i built the amazon project i built uh my slack project i got like three solid projects done is that enough to start job hunting yeah i would literally start in fact i would actually this is what's crazy right in in the one month one i would tell you to actually start teaching straight away i was asking you to teach right so like you start to teach you can make an income in month one from teaching if you learn how to put a web together a web page together on a very basically other people right yeah teach someone else how to do that and then you can start making money at that point now months after month two you might have built a few builds and you might be comfortable enough to be like you know what let me go ahead and check freelancer.com or fiverr or something like that i might be able to actually pick up a client so at that point you can actually make money on that yep and then a month three you could be like okay i've got a few clients on my belt i've been i've done something now and you can start actually applying for a job like and it's really is possible and it's we've tried it's tried and tested and it works it's very possible guys um yeah like teaching is one of my favorite routes because i think it is lowest barrier to entry you just have to teach somebody who's one level behind you so for example even if you learned like patch right now for example um he and he can do he has just a two months of experience with coding he was a bartender before so zero experience with coding before that but now he's done some basics of web dev and he's built the amazon project he can not he can teach like 70 of the people on these online platforms that are looking to get coaching for like learning how to code yeah and platforms like wise and um is a good platform uh if you're in us we have take lessons which is another good one for us uh if you guys are not in us another great one is craigslist so yeah literally if i'm patch i can make posts with uh image like i would make sure that i i put my picture on there because people want to see you just like a smiling picture and then you just talking about you have coding experience and you can teach people how to build amazon project like literally i would write that in my copy for the ad and i promise you you will actually get so many clients from that it'll be crazy i started my career in coding off of i was three months in instead of going the job hunting route i actually um within the first three months i was teaching coding and i started getting tons and tons of clients because i would do crazy amount of outreach i would be like reaching out to 50 to 100 people a day and i was just like disciplined as hell about that i would just like reach out to so many people and i was able to scale my income to like within five to seven thousand dollars or more per month and then i just my teaching alone i was making over 100k a year and then on top of that i was getting software development jobs too like freelancing so yeah that really allowed me to push it over the edge but it depends on you guys right if you just hate teaching really don't want to do it okay don't do it but teaching for me was one of the biggest hacks because what it allows you to do is really it's a hack for you to like learn really fast has that ever happened to you guys where you were teaching a concept to somebody whether it's in coding or anything else in life maybe you were teaching somebody a tip on how to use like their computer and the first time you taught them maybe a math thing or a computer thing or whatever it really clicked in your head and you're like ah that makes sense yeah that's the power of teaching it's really just you learning but on like steroids because when you have to clearly explain a concept to somebody it like instills it in your brain so for me it was just a hack to become a better skilled developer extremely fast exactly but i got you hated guys how about a multiplayer game with javascript just imagine micro payments and going viral with such project rpg style can we do that next please hands up guys hands up if you want to hear that yeah hey that's beautiful that's a sick idea yeah okay dope um so yeah so that's what so if we were to do it again guys even if you wanted to make it extremely basic and you're like i don't want to go to teaching route that's fine first three months do bills web dev projects and all the projects we have already for you on youtube and also in profit with javascript course we go deeper so then those portfolios and those things on your resume will look even more badass and then between months three and six now what do i do sunny like what do what does like let's say patch does all of this what does he do between months three and six right so three and six is pretty much so once you land that job right so let's say you land the job oh you're skipping the you're you're skipping the part so let's say i did three months of builds and learning right now how do i land my job between months three and six right so you would want to set up different so it depends at this point you wanna you need to identify is it going to be freelancing is it going to be a fulltime job right two different very different things most people want to go full time so let's address fulltime as well okay so fulltime there's so many platforms out there right now so hired.com is one that i recommend oh nice okay higher.com yeah i use hired.com quite a lot now hired.com is basically imagine you flip the script with interviews right so rather than that you going and interviewing for all like sending out recruiter emails and all sorts of rubbish like that you just go onto this website literally put in your details and they come to you with offers right so they find you and literally i've landed literally two jobs off the site like and they're very good paying jobs like uh and and they also sent me a bunch of stuff as well like as soon as i got the job they even gave me a little coffee mug and they bought a champagne and a bunch of other stuff and a 300 amazon gift voucher so i couldn't believe it like it's insane so um so companies like this you want to sign up too um i would also recommend signing up to things like yzan and all those takelessons.com just if you haven't already if you're in us yeah if you're in the u.s and guys one thing that all of you guys should be doing without a doubt is recording your entire journey right whether it's on social media or anything like that because that is actually unbelievably powerful yeah because when we said teaching as well we were talking about you can teach through social media right if you write a post that's informative and you say hey here's what i learned today about react right dude that's gonna help somebody else that's going to help a lot of people out i'm going to slap a present we're exactly at 600 in chat revenue um dude that's insane let's go oh holy crap like that is insane wow thank you guys so much for that insane all right my bad i didn't mean to kill your flow no no that's insane dude like literally so now um yeah so after months three i would say pretty much go ahead and start applying so make sure you try and look for those kind of sites they're really really good um but just like kazi said right it's all about that aggressive approach tired is kind of like tinder for developers right it basically just the the other people hit you up tired basically makes you like a hot girl on tinder yeah exactly they just like beef you up literally like make you attracted to employers and then employers will come out and reach you and you just select which one you want that's pretty much literally such a nice experience okay no cruz noel bro crews just dropped a 5 donation he says i had technical issues while getting vs code studio working i was finally able to figure out thank you for sharing your knowledge yes bro thank you that is incredible wow yeah huge yep so tin deaf people are still talking about dev um so there you guys go that is basically one of the clearest road maps you can have to becoming a 100k a year react developer and so it doesn't get any clearer than that guys like this is exactly what you should be doing on month one two and three if it makes sense to you by the way drop in the comments below like does this make sense to you like yeah if it did and it brought some value to you smash the thumbs up oh yeah do it because this is really what it takes for you to get hired right and hired.com hencehigher.com and it makes your life so much easier than a lot of this going to indeed.com and like blast applying to a million platforms whereas here you can stand out now okay so say sunny i appl i apply on hired.com now what happens after that do i just wait or do i you know like go back to working on my coding skills or do i go on linkedin and try to reach out to as many people as i can like what is the process there or yeah yeah so you never want to stop moving guys right so i see a lot of people when they land the job that even when you land the job i see people kind of get into a comfortable place they get into a comfort zone you want to be far away from a comfortable spot like never be sitting in that comfort zone where you're not learning right if you land the job or if you're in the process of getting interviews keep sharpening that blade right keep sharpening that skill set make sure that you can really really um i think i think i don't know who said this quote if you guys know it drop in the comments but basically it was like i think it's abraham lincoln it was like if i've got like i don't know like five days i'm just gonna change the timing but if i've got like a year to um go ahead and cut down a tree i'm gonna go ahead and spend the first 11 months sharpening the blade hey right and then so like it literally is like a powerful quote because it's literally like you want to make sure your skills are dialed in that means signing up to newsletters for react signing up to newsletters for javascript yeah all these things are going to help you stay ahead of the curve yep right like investing in yourself to grow your own skills what i used to do dude that made me a really kickass developer really really fast is every single dollar i would earn on my own i would pay developers like on codemen i would go to codementor um which is are you familiar with that platform by the way or no codementor yeah yeah so i would go to literally a code mentor find some developer there so i can actually even show you guys this and i would find another developer there and i would hire them to teach me so say like i worked some job or i like taught clients or whatever and i was getting paid 50 an hour so say i worked for somebody for two hours and they gave me a hundred dollars right yep then i'd be like yo i only have like six months of experience of coding i would go online hire a developer from here on demand to teach me like python at the time um but you guys can actually pick somebody who teaches you react or javascript and i would pay them like 50 an hour 70 an hour so essentially i was trading my time and i was just feeding all the money back into them and then growing my skills for free because i knew my skill was the ultimate thing that was going to pay the most yeah so just reinvest every single dollar back into my own skill a lot of people are trying to invest all their money into 401k you uh you guys are trying to invest your money into ir roth ira you guys are trying to invest your money into stocks nobody ever gets rich from any of these things nobody ever breaks out and has financial freedom from any of these things it's complete [ __ ] like most places you look at how they got rich if you ask them how they put so much money into roth ira or their stock portfolios it's from they were doing something that earned them a really high income so focus aggressively on developing one skill that can get you a high income if you look at yourself like a stock you have the greatest earnings on yourself like for example sunny can have two choices right sunny can today put a hundred dollars into the tesla stock let's go back to when you were becoming a developer right you could have had you could have put a hundred dollars into the tesla stock or you could have put a hundred dollars into your own self to learn the skill of react yeah which one would have had like a hundred x return tesla is yeah and also another way to put it guys is what the mindset that we often see and that most of society is trapped in is if i said to you guys or like if your friend comes to your house and says hey like you want to go for a meal today or hey you want to go watch film you're going to go for a night out you pretty much i guarantee most of us will be like yeah yeah yeah let's go right yeah but if i asked you to buy a react a book on react or a webinar about react for 20 or like 10 you i guarantee the conversation would be a lot different you'd be like that's kind of expensive but we would all happily pay like 50 on a night out or 100 on the night out you see what i'm saying so like that mindset has to switch in order to achieve financial freedom otherwise you'll never just you're just never going to get there yep like yeah and one of the other things that happens is when you've had that happen right where you've got something for free versus something you paid a lot for and the massive amount of difference between how one of them doesn't do anything for your life because you don't care because it's cheap yeah versus where you paid for something and then you take notes then you actually do everything that's being said you actually go and complete the thing which is why oftentimes like coding boot camps get a success high success rate because if you're investing 10 or 15 000 into a coding boot camp you're gonna be serious you're not gonna [ __ ] around like you're like hey i'm committed to this whereas sometimes people just watch you videos on youtube and you know there's like fraction of a fraction of a fraction of people who actually take action right most people are just watching it getting entertainment out of it maybe it's like it they enjoyed watching the content but there's the tiniest amount that less than one one one percent of one percent of one percent that actually goes and builds projects and does these things so when it comes to investing in yourself whether you're trying to invest on code mentor whether you're trying to invest into a coding bootcamp whether you're trying to invest into our profit with javascript course whether you're trying to invest into a book from amazon into react or anything guys please do not be scared of that that is the guaranteed fastest way to get to a hundred thousand dollars a year as a react developer elizabeth who is also a dj and she's like dope as [ __ ] she pops up in her streams her name is future code she's like i don't know is she paying you for coaching yeah yeah so she's actually my oneonone coach yeah she doesn't i coach her so she's deciding to pay sonny to get oneonone coaching from him and now she's actually going through like a crazy technical interview and i think she's probably there today and she's in between getting a pretty sick job yeah that's true yeah she had it today guys and yeah i literally do oneonone coaching with her and she chose to invest in herself right now if any of you guys were on my instagram earlier i actually had corey on there and i'm coaching him as well um so these people are actually they choosing to put money into themselves and i'm telling you those are the people who are going to see those 10x 100x returns yep in the future here's something great i want to highlight okay so here's something that i want to highlight puttvik says are you kidding me twenty dollars per 15 minutes which is what some of the developers are charging on code mentor there's so many other resources to learn let me ask you pudvit exactly how much are you making and i promise you the answer is going to be putvik is making a very very little amount of money i can tell you that right yeah so this is what's called scarcity thinking you think that there isn't enough out there if you go out there looking for the freest resources all you're looking for is like cost and there's only a limit to how much cost you can cut but there's no limit to how much you can earn on the upper side now imagine this on the other hand where so teary is dropping 50 or 100 on the donation in just even our live stream right if you have a developer like sunny who can help you one on one he's not gonna be charging you two dollars he's going to be charging you more because his work and his results are worth more if you work with sunny you have really high chances of getting over 100 000 a year job but if you go to and learn from somebody who's charging maybe three dollars an hour from india and they're probably also not making that much right so maybe max you'll get a job for ten thousand dollars a year exactly guys so that really really crunches down to investing in yourself and actually i guess the way to put it is valuing yourself enough so that you are saying that to me what patrick's message basically says is he doesn't think he's worth twenty dollars for every 15 minutes yeah right if you're not willing to invest that into yourself to learn a skill you think you are not worth or will ever be worth 20 per 15 minutes yeah and then that's actually going to be your reality too yeah and you know what dude so many people are brainwashed by like society today like with education system they will happily pay like ridiculous amounts of money for university yep right like insane amounts of money for universities but like yeah like eighty thousand a hundred thousand a year for or you know uh for yeah now dude let me ask you a question like if i if i gave you like let's say i said to you right you have his 80 grand right you have two choices put it all into personal development and courses and all those things or it will literally pay for one year at university what's your decision people will always pick a university most people will because they're used to that but then look at the debt dude somebody who developed puts investment into personal development like you know like it's just results um i invested all into my personal development my skill set i grew really really fast as like a software developer now i'm lucky enough to work with amazing people and be a clever programmer and i dropped out of college because my professor was asking me for career advice and i was like you know i'll probably get out of here but i was investing heavily into personal development my own coding skills i had mentors for like physical fitness i had mentors for like learning more business and marketing skills i would have mentors for really everything and because i was just like i only care about growing my skill set because if you i feel like this right you can test a person and their character if i take everything away from you so who is sunny if i take every single thing physical thing away from you like your mic is gone your cool camera is gone your like instagram account is gone your everything you have if that is gone who are you what do you have what can you do and if you can code and you can make badass apps that's the thing i cannot take away from you yeah and that's the thing that's going to make you really yeah i've never thought of it that way it's a really really nice way of putting it yeah yeah like i'm a big big believer in that so that's why you guys have to change your mentality from thinking about expenses and something being expensive and you guys got to think in terms of value right so if you think in value everything changes you know cause you actually change my mind on some of that and guys this is like a true story right now so i remember i was saying to quasi yo should i upgrade my screen and my setup even the mic right like things like that like i mean cause he went back and forth he was like dude like why are you even questioning it the fact you've been asking for longer than five minutes right now buy the thing it's gonna come back to you right it's an investment in yourself and ever since then ever since we've started doing that things are really they grow things are going much better like you you're much more efficient with your time so don't even waste five minutes on the decision if it's gonna if it's something an investment in what you love and what you think that you believe in yourself to do then go ahead and jump and do it yep 100 like i cannot stress this enough like if there's one hack you're looking for to become rich if there's one quick tip which is what a lot of people are looking for is aggress as aggressively as you can invest in yourself to grow your skills be religious to skills money is a lagging indicator of your skill and the value that you bring so i'm going to say this one more time it's really important for you to understand money hold on so this stuff right here right this whatever it is this is a lagging indicator of my skill and the value that i can bring okay so now if i can only clean your floors in your house you're gonna be like okay bro here you go like you did a good job today here's like 20 bucks okay great now i got 20 bucks but i learned the skill of actually cleaning the floors i if i even clean them really really well maybe you'll give me like a five dollar tip and you'll be like hey bro here you go here's 20 bucks and then here's a five dollar tip and you're like boom there you go right but now on the other hand let's say that you're actually developing an app let's say you're serving the app to millions of people like tinder and you're helping change the world you're helping people have kids getting married match make on an app like tinder or hire.com or whatever now you are providing crazy amount of value right but then you hire me i'm your react developer and i have to now turn your tinder app or whatever uber app into a reality where it can help millions of people now i can bring you so much value it's crazy you're gonna be like bro you're just gonna let you you'll be like here's a hundred bucks here's another 20. here's another just take everything like take it all because what you're bringing for me is changing the entire world and i get to make a lot of money and i can grow my business and i can help people so here you go like this is not anything to me like does that make sense guys like it's just money just a lagging indicator of skill and value so if you spend all your time on the skill and value they can provide to people then as you do that months or years later then you can get a lot of this but if you think extremely short term and you do everything that gets you money right this second and you don't invest in your skill and you do parttime uber and you spend all this time doing like crappy jobs that don't let you work on your skills then this is what you get right now and this is also what you get in the next 10 years if you can eat [ __ ] and focus just on your skills you will get nothing right now i'll give you zero dollars right now but then here like maybe you can make like hundreds you know of dollars or more and that all goes to you yeah dude that's so powerful money is a lagging indicator if you think of it that way it really just rewires your brain in some sense yep right like it's true because most of us like we get paid a certain amount and we're like that's my worth it's not your worth it's a lagging indicator i will prove that to you i will prove that to every single person who here here's a here's a very basic example of money being an indicator of value okay take a look at this how long have we been live one hour and 41. okay how would you guys like to make 609 per 1 hour and 41 minutes would you guys like to make about 600 an hour that's insane yeah we're about 300 let's just say 300 an hour would you guys like to make that yes or no how is this happening and this is just donations we're not talking about anything else why is this happening the value that like sunny and clever programmer team right we are working hard to provide value to millions of people millions every single day our stream ends we have these messages in our own slack team it says 151 days of watch time a hundred days of watch time 200 days of watch time you know what that means every two or three hours we help move the world forward by 200 days by a hundred days so we're providing massive value up front right so then it's really easy for us and for to justify 300 an hour or more just and that's just donations you can do the same thing exactly that's why like i want you guys to get out of the mindset of something is expensive only think in the mindset of what can i do right now that can make me so damn valuable like whatever our course is right profit with javascript whether it's 300 or 500 or 900 doesn't matter what it is but if you were to invest that and on the other side there's a potential for you to make thirty thousand or fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars or more per year are you really losing money right are you really losing anything or not just our course right if you're investing in somebody else's course on udemy or their own platforms or whatever it is it's an investment in yourself so i just want to make sure that you guys know how valuable you are and that you are your biggest investment and asset exactly and guys investing is not just monetary right it's not just money when we're talking it investing your time as well is also a huge investment like if you're waking up late going to sleep late you're not really getting much done in the day right like you're wasting so much like valuable time that could be dedicated investing and learning where you can invest this stuff into yourself so even if you don't have the money as such you can start that transformation right now by changing the way that you spend your time wake up early get that sleep in before and don't stay up late watching netflix every day like those subtle changes or what leads to you then improving as a person improving your skill set that builds up your monetary value because you're going to be able to do more with your time and then you can do what kazi said so you can start right now regardless if you have the money or not and guys if you want to start right now and actually this won't cost you a thing and this is going to be a thing that is they'll bring so much value to your life if you guys enjoyed this today wait till what we have for you on day six which is september 13th which is two days from now guys it's gonna be the most valuepacked thing you have

100 sumeet says can i become a software engineer at fang in eight months if i start learning data structures and algorithms today i would say learn the actual stuff which matters dude like uh don't worry about data structures and algorithms worry about building uh actual apps so building things like the clones that's gonna be more of a chance of how you're gonna get hired by fang as opposed to data structure and algorithms exactly how dev roy says how i can mix my skill of javascript with react um okay i think he's saying java i think he's saying java would react okay so i actually came from a java background so um to help you out there dude just start right so honestly just start you use the resources use clever programmer use proper javascript use w3schools um learn how to google

action takers get the best deals and then as we begin to get late action takers and people are procrastinating um it's gonna be more expensive um and the best deals or the bonuses are not gonna be there so because we wanna incentivize fast action takers to join first so then because those are the people who crush it right those are the people like patch who join those are the people like louis who join and they're all action takers they're already crushing it even the video testimonials you know they were like crushing it yeah i saw somebody say how do i join today uh you literally just go

javascript course and you know if you're watching this and this page is still up you're lucky because this page will be closed down and um you will have to be on a wait list but if it's open right now it means you're still able to join exactly guys yeah so there you go we have to watch this closes guys i can't stress to you enough like we try to keep it very selfcontained which means once the doors close you won't be able to access this page okay so it is temporarily open right now and then on sunday we're going to actually open the doors for every single person and then once those doors close like they are done they are closed that that it is a exclusive environment yeah we'll give you a little bit of a sneak peek of this program right now hold on where is this audio coming from i'm going to figure this out in the meantime let's check out the comments so uh ahmed says do you need to learn javascript then react yes it's part of the you need to learn like sort of the fundamentals web dev like html css javascript but all of it is covered in inside of javascript we teach you if as we assume that you know nothing and we teach you from the absolute beginning so even setting up vs code we run from that level and then we take you all the way up even with coaching calls and everything until you're at the point where you're absolutely crushing it landing clients teaching people adding jobs we're going to hold your hand the entire way uh what why why do i get the weirdest freaking errors on this entire planet oh there is also one more person with pwj um that is nas yeah nas is also teaching yeah thank you thank you so much baby that is legendary i just got some food delivery let's go thank you everybody my amazing girlfriend amber lee hi to everybody hi everybody oh i don't know where to look everybody give it up for my amazing boyfriend quasi hey let's go guys all right let's get back into it so um let's have a look so all right hashtag girlfriend op hey let's go i will never understand ever why these errors happen to me i'm paying for sound source see over it yeah go down that's what all right fine so guys you can go and watch this video it's on this page but if you want to join today you can uh but we're going to be opening the doors officially on the 13th yep exactly guys all right so there we go is it not working the audio oh yeah that's actually right so the audio is not gonna be working so that's gonna be pretty pathetic what i just don't understand these like weird errors uh zero one text says uh your message if you write in all caps it's gonna get blocked by the nightbots we have like an automatic moderator so please don't write in all capitals um so text says please can i have somebody teach me for one week if you're inside a proper job we run coaching calls where i run them it's a zoom call which means that you guys can have a full conversation it's not like this where we have just text um yeah it's not like this where we just have text and things like that it's going to be a complete conversation that's going to be huge for you guys yep exactly so i think that's going to be massive um i'll try to see if i can try to play some of them with um i don't know if they'll actually play or not but let's try let's do it i don't think it's gonna play but uh i started coding just a few months ago when i was furloughed um i jumped into the fiveday react challenge to try and push myself i wonder if i could i think they can hear it if you guys can hear um chris that's great but he said i started coding when i was furloughed after i was furloughed from the job because of covid i did i was really really nervous about it dude that's not in the comments if you can hear this i was really nervous i think they can hear it bro i i can't hear it but they can hear it i'm happy that i took that leap of faith um as far as the future is concerned all right let's just let play continue yeah i'm listening to it continue to learn uh hopefully reach a point where i can land multiple clients so he's saying i want to reach a point where i can land multiple clients or make some money above all else be happy while i'm doing it and in the back he's actually like coding it up i just want to say thank you and uh see you along the road see you guys nice nice oh did you see stuff that's awesome dude here's andrea this one was a cool one too if we have any other ones you like sunny we can play them as well yeah so let me have a look nice glad you guys can hear it at least somebody can hear it veronica's pretty much she's in the slack channel in react challenge that one was awesome i'm making a great effort to see an a certificate damn what a badass yeah that's awesome a badass so on slack there is in the react challenge group there's a amazing video that i've uploaded by veronica let's go ahead and play that one um okay in react on september 2020 uh oh in the channel yep oh my god we're starting to get so many groups again in slack yeah it's a freaking nightmare someone said where is nos noz is right behind kazi guys yeah nas is right behind me so i'm gonna move my chair and it will reveal gnaws give it up for wow beautiful beautiful all righty here we go here we go i will never find whatever we're looking for oh we took a massive donation from louise fernando sanchez so much for it yeah so a 20 discount 20 discount now i'm 100 sure he's activated again just five minutes so guys the price of the program it's like if you find it for below underneath like five thousand dollars if if you find it for less than five thousand dollars profit javascript it's a steal just take it yeah because it's only gonna go up like it's the price is gonna shoot up to a thousand or more very very soon in like one or two weeks it's gonna be over a thousand bucks so if you get it for anything less than that it's a crazy steal because all the students keep telling us this program is worth more than a five thousand dollar coding boot camp cause you're like this program is worth more than the 15 000 recording boot camp that i just took it's an insane program at this point with like three to four weekly coaching calls you're getting insane projects that are landing people a hundred thousand dollar a year job so if it's a hundred dollar 200 difference don't worry about that just get the program if it's less than 5 000 you're good you're getting the best deal possible exactly anything less than five thousand don't trip over what did they say don't trip over dollars to pick up pennies all right don't trip over dollars to pick up pennies all right let me play this one oh [ __ ] i just hold on i full screened it on my tv um she even added subtitles sick yeah this one's this one's insane all right here we
