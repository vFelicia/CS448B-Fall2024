00:00 - hey what's up you guys aaron here from
00:02 - clever programmer calm and in this video
00:05 - we're going to be going over the top
00:07 - three programming languages that you
00:09 - should learn in 2020 if you're a
00:12 - beginner alright so I'm gonna be going
00:14 - through this video based on a big
00:15 - assumption and that is that you are new
00:17 - to coding or you're a complete beginner
00:18 - or something because if you're advanced
00:20 - and experienced I don't know why you'd
00:22 - be here besides entertainment hopefully
00:24 - you enjoy it but to get actually bite
00:25 - value out of this kind of topic I think
00:27 - you probably need to be a beginner so
00:28 - I'm just gonna go on that assumption
00:29 - alright if you don't know me I am a
00:31 - software developer here at clever
00:33 - programmer I've been here for about a
00:34 - year now
00:34 - I'm a currently a Georgia Tech graduate
00:37 - student studying AI yeah I just want to
00:39 - take my stab at this top three
00:41 - programming language on video because a
00:42 - lot of the other ones that I see it kind
00:44 - of just say like hey these are the top
00:45 - three languages for these reasons blah
00:46 - blah blah just go pick one and go do it
00:48 - alright but for me I kind of want to
00:49 - make something a little bit more
00:50 - comprehensive for a beginner so instead
00:52 - of Oh top three and then pick these and
00:54 - go whatever I'm actually gonna pick
00:56 - three languages that I think you should
00:57 - learn first and in a specific order to
01:00 - fully set you up to be a software
01:01 - developer when they want to be a
01:02 - freelancer or a full-time developer or
01:04 - whatever so I'm actually gonna be giving
01:06 - you like a roadmap as a beginner and I
01:07 - think that's actually the best I'll also
01:09 - be giving a little bit of context with
01:10 - things because I know you're a beginner
01:11 - so like when I use certain words I'll
01:12 - explain a little bit I'm just enough to
01:14 - kind of so you're not fully confused but
01:15 - I'm not gonna be going into depth
01:17 - I'll just be focusing on the languages
01:19 - and why they're good you might get it a
01:20 - little bit lost with some of the words
01:21 - but just follow along and take my word
01:23 - for and hopefully why the end of it
01:24 - you'll understand why I think this is
01:25 - the best roadmap for you and then right
01:28 - after this video just jump in and start
01:29 - coding alright that's why you're here
01:31 - right so without any further ado let's
01:33 - get started before we get started though
01:35 - Before we jump into it I want to tell
01:37 - you that we have an epic free three-part
01:39 - master class it teaches you how to go
01:41 - from being a complete beginner and
01:43 - programming not knowing anything if
01:44 - you've never written a single line of
01:45 - code and the steps you can take to
01:48 - become a six-figure freelancer or a
01:51 - software developer so if you want to
01:52 - learn how to go from there to there
01:54 - click the link in the description down
01:55 - below it should be down there just gonna
01:57 - pop in your email address in your name
01:58 - and it will send you an email to the
02:01 - login page for that and you can access
02:04 - it completely for free
02:05 - and it ends with a an exclusive webinar
02:08 - if you want to check that out too after
02:10 - the three parts so if I guess it's kind
02:11 - of like a four part master class but I
02:13 - definitely check it out all right it'll
02:14 - it's just a lot of free value and just
02:16 - we want to offer that to you so check it
02:18 - out all right you guys so I want to let
02:22 - you know that this video is sponsored by
02:23 - Skillshare Skillshare is a website kind
02:27 - of more like a community of creatives
02:30 - and intellectuals that can create
02:32 - courses for each other okay so you go in
02:34 - there and then you can post your courses
02:35 - whatever you can take courses um you can
02:37 - actually sign up as an instructor but I
02:38 - mean usually you'd be taking the courses
02:40 - yourself but you can go in there and you
02:42 - can learn things on any topic pretty
02:44 - much anything really I mean eat
02:46 - including like software development so
02:47 - you can learn things like there's some
02:48 - Java courses and there's probably
02:50 - JavaScript courses as well as Python
02:52 - courses if you want to go through there
02:53 - you can learn other things like
02:55 - photography and like pretty much
02:56 - anything that you want but basically
02:57 - it's just a community where you can
02:59 - really dive into your passions no matter
03:00 - what industry it's in whatever hobby you
03:02 - have and you can just go in and check it
03:05 - out okay so there's a bunch of fair just
03:06 - go check it out they just rebranded
03:07 - their whole website looks really clean
03:09 - and nice it was different like last
03:10 - month right it was like different last
03:12 - month what looks great now so go check
03:13 - it out is like nice and juicy and fresh
03:14 - for 2020 profs the skill shell for that
03:17 - it's pretty cheap too like I think there
03:19 - is subscriptions for like less than 10
03:20 - bucks a month or something if you want
03:21 - to do that however because you're
03:24 - watching this video and because they're
03:25 - a sponsor if you click the link in the
03:26 - description then you can actually get to
03:28 - three months to completely free months
03:30 - of premium membership to really explore
03:33 - whatever creative endeavor is that
03:34 - you're interested in in your life okay
03:36 - so I mean doesn't hurt just try out two
03:38 - three months and yeah just click on the
03:39 - link in the description you're good to
03:41 - go so check out Skillshare so
03:47 - programming language number one the
03:49 - first one I think you should learn if
03:51 - you're beginner is definitely definitely
03:53 - Python okay so python is a very general
03:56 - purpose very clean very minimalistic
03:58 - very easy high-level language and
04:01 - basically what that means is it's just
04:03 - very beginner friendly okay so most of
04:05 - my classes at Georgia Tech right now I'm
04:07 - actually using Python for whatever it is
04:08 - just because it's you can get your ideas
04:11 - into code the fastest you'll have to
04:12 - worry about like computer e stuff
04:13 - there's like no you don't have to like
04:15 - allocate your memory like other program
04:16 - languages you actually have to be like
04:17 - hey save this much memory like save one
04:20 - megabyte of memory over here like save
04:22 - this and then I'm gonna put like a few
04:24 - numbers in there okay cool save it for
04:25 - later do some computations over here in
04:27 - this memory and then come back and beg
04:29 - to get it back and then wipe it clean
04:31 - like you have to do that manually like
04:32 - Oh allocate this and that like in C or
04:34 - C++ but pipe or in a little bit less so
04:37 - in other languages like as you get more
04:38 - higher level up but Python is the most
04:40 - high level one and clean and just the
04:42 - best to use all right it's the best one
04:44 - to get your hands to do back oh and you
04:45 - can learn all about like the biggest
04:47 - ideas and programming and then you'll
04:49 - just kind of have like a big overall
04:51 - understanding of what programming really
04:52 - is and then you can go forward with that
04:54 - so another another great thing about
04:56 - Python is once you know Python I mean if
04:58 - you know the basics then I mean it's
05:01 - kind of useless to be honest like you
05:02 - it's you can do things but to actually
05:05 - like be a full-blown developer after
05:07 - programming languages you must learn
05:09 - further things like frameworks libraries
05:11 - and other things like algorithms and how
05:14 - to connect to api's and how to do
05:16 - version control which is like saving
05:18 - copies of your code like so you can go
05:20 - back and like how to develop on a team
05:22 - like there's so many other things passed
05:23 - just learning a programming language
05:24 - that you need to know to actually be
05:26 - successful as a developer once you know
05:28 - Python it's really cool because with
05:29 - Python you can do so many things you can
05:31 - do web development with frameworks like
05:33 - Django or flats all the framework is
05:35 - I'll explain really click if you don't
05:36 - know what that word means it's just you
05:37 - learn Python you have these things like
05:39 - how do you code in Python like core
05:40 - Python and then on top of Python they
05:42 - add like more like code things that you
05:44 - have to learn but it's in Python so you
05:46 - understand how everything works but
05:47 - there's just like some extra stuff piled
05:48 - on to it it's like advanced Python I
05:50 - guess and then within that framework you
05:52 - can develop even more cool things but
05:54 - like before you can learn the framework
05:56 - you gotta learn the language so you can
05:58 - do web development with Python but you
06:00 - can also do a lot of data science things
06:01 - and scientific computing with libraries
06:04 - like numpy which is like numeric Python
06:06 - or Syfy which is like science Python or
06:08 - pandas which is a library where you can
06:10 - do a lot of like number crunching or
06:12 - data science like machine learning you
06:14 - can use pi torch or tensorflow and latin
06:16 - frameworks like those libraries like
06:18 - those to do things down the road so once
06:21 - you know Python you're basically set up
06:22 - to branch out to
06:23 - things down the road once you have
06:25 - gotten a little bit more experience so
06:27 - Python is definitely the best start with
06:29 - that oh and the last thing also it's
06:31 - great for coding interviews because if
06:33 - you want to get a job at a big tech
06:34 - company like a fain company then Python
06:36 - is a very popular language to do the
06:38 - coding interviews is because you can
06:39 - implement things very quickly cleanly
06:40 - and they accept Python it's very
06:42 - well-established alright alright so that
06:44 - was the first one Python if you want to
06:46 - shortcut your path on actually making a
06:49 - profit with Python then we have a free
06:51 - three-part master class on how you can
06:53 - go from zero to six figures potentially
06:55 - with as a Python full stack web
06:57 - developer jump in there it's free just
06:59 - check it out we also have free Python
07:01 - courses on our own channels and you'll
07:03 - learn Python you can learn from us for
07:04 - free ok we have multiple courses as a
07:05 - twenty twenty one go check it out I'm in
07:07 - a lot of that check it out you can learn
07:08 - the Python basics there so yeah just
07:11 - check out that stuff we a lot we have a
07:12 - lot of stuff on Python that's kind of
07:13 - what this channel is about so go learn
07:14 - it and yeah now we're gonna be going
07:16 - onto the next language so after you're
07:18 - done learning Python okay uh you might
07:21 - want to branch into my view framework or
07:22 - two of here if you're curious but if you
07:24 - just went on start learning a second
07:25 - language which I actually think is a
07:26 - good idea because then you can kind of
07:28 - understand the general idea of
07:29 - programming you're not just like stuck
07:31 - in like oh Python write these words and
07:33 - letters and numbers and I can do this
07:34 - thing
07:35 - oh I understand this but then if you
07:36 - understand how to do the same thing like
07:38 - if you can write the same program in
07:39 - Python and a second language then you
07:41 - your brain starts understanding coding
07:43 - as a whole instead of just oh I get
07:45 - Python it's oh I get coding which is
07:47 - actually what you want because there's
07:48 - always new languages coming up but I
07:49 - think this is the best course to go so
07:51 - going on the programming language number
07:53 - two this is going to be JavaScript so
07:55 - after you're done learning Python okay
07:57 - javascript is number two and the reason
07:59 - for that is because javascript is a
08:02 - language of the web okay
08:04 - it's a programming language that is
08:06 - deeply ingrained in like the Internet so
08:08 - on webpages like rub pages are ran on
08:10 - JavaScript herbs anything animated or
08:12 - anything like interactive on a webpage
08:14 - or website it's run by JavaScript okay
08:16 - and another thing that you should know
08:18 - is like 50% or more of all developer
08:21 - jobs or web development so if you want
08:23 - to get a job as a software developer
08:25 - you're gonna need web development okay
08:26 - you're going to have JavaScript you're
08:27 - gonna need to know this to be actually
08:29 - be able to succeed this is because
08:30 - probably like a lot of like business
08:32 - and other things and things that the
08:33 - things that run the world like they want
08:35 - it to be online like businesses want
08:36 - websites people want to be able to
08:38 - distribute things across the internet
08:39 - and everything so everything is
08:40 - web-based now it's gonna be going more
08:41 - and more there so you're definitely
08:43 - gonna want to learn JavaScript okay one
08:45 - caveat though to JavaScript is you will
08:47 - not understand JavaScript on me you
08:49 - can't like fully use JavaScript to its
08:52 - fullest potential if you do not know
08:53 - HTML and CSS okay so actually these
08:57 - three languages as a whole I'm actually
08:58 - packaging in my son for two so i a
09:00 - little coffee out there but you need to
09:02 - know HTML to know how what's what web
09:05 - pages are built and then CSS to make i'm
09:08 - CSS to know how the web pages look so
09:10 - you can like style them and then
09:12 - javascript have added functionality and
09:14 - code to it so you're gonna you're gonna
09:16 - need to know all three so actually
09:18 - number two and you should learn them in
09:19 - this order is learn HTML then CSS then
09:23 - JavaScript so learn Python first and
09:24 - then these three in that order all right
09:26 - what's great about JavaScript though is
09:28 - there are a lot of really really great
09:30 - frameworks that have been coming up in
09:31 - recent years that allow you to build
09:33 - full applications from using just
09:36 - JavaScript so there's something in some
09:38 - for development called full stack
09:39 - development and all that means is like
09:41 - you have a full stack to something which
09:43 - means like on the top you have your
09:44 - front-end which is like how stuff looks
09:45 - on the screen to the user and then like
09:47 - in the middle of the stack you might
09:48 - have like some processing and stuff and
09:50 - then on the bottom of the stack you
09:51 - might have like a database where like
09:52 - data is stored where you can like
09:53 - shuffle around data retrieve data like
09:55 - Instagram posts from what from from your
09:57 - account and then display to the screen
09:58 - that's the front-end but then like
10:00 - storing it is the backend so we have
10:02 - front and plus back-end then you have
10:04 - everything is called a full stack web
10:05 - developer what's cool about JavaScript
10:08 - though is although you can do while
10:10 - diliman with Python or Django and flask
10:12 - and stuff can't be like like a fully
10:14 - fully fledged full stack full stack web
10:16 - developer if you don't know JavaScript
10:17 - but with JavaScript you can actually be
10:19 - a complete full stack web developer from
10:23 - end to end like from all the way down at
10:25 - the bottom like their string works you
10:26 - can use like for the for the front end
10:28 - on JavaScript you can use frameworks
10:30 - like react or angularjs or vue.js look
10:34 - those up if you're curious and then for
10:36 - your back-end you can also use like
10:38 - something like nodejs to get it done so
10:41 - you can have like you can hold like some
10:42 - data in a database
10:43 - whatever you need it when I say JSA
10:45 - means dot JavaScript okay so these are
10:46 - just frameworks are gonna learn after
10:48 - you learn core JavaScript you can go on
10:49 - and learn these frameworks on top of it
10:51 - feel free to branch out and learn those
10:53 - if you're interested when you hit it but
10:54 - I think you should definitely definitely
10:55 - learn JavaScript HTML CSS and JavaScript
10:59 - second great after you've learned Python
11:01 - because it's the web is the future and
11:03 - it's just so versatile and Python was
11:05 - the limit with django and flask plus
11:06 - javascript and all these frameworks
11:07 - makes a killer killer combo so you're
11:10 - gonna be like set up after just learning
11:11 - these two languages and then I guess
11:13 - HTML and CSS they're not languages but
11:15 - they're like supplemental things that
11:16 - you need to learn then you will you'll
11:18 - be set up to be a full stack web
11:20 - developer and go on and one other cool
11:22 - thing is with these with these web
11:23 - frameworks and things like react native
11:25 - you can actually create kind of hybrid
11:27 - mobile apps even if you want to get into
11:29 - that but mobile app developments a
11:31 - little bit advanced so I don't want to
11:32 - mention that here I wouldn't recommend
11:33 - getting into that first it's fun but I
11:35 - would actually recommend going with
11:36 - Python first and just learning how to
11:37 - code on a computer before you get into
11:38 - like all this crazy swiss stuff or
11:40 - flutter or anything but on the third
11:42 - language i'm gonna go into i do touch on
11:44 - it a little bit so we're gonna get that
11:46 - shortly so after you have learned python
11:48 - and HTML and CSS and javascript if you
11:51 - haven't already like gotten interested
11:53 - and like one off to learn your own
11:54 - frameworks and completely forgot about
11:55 - this video and did your own thing I
11:56 - think the third language that you should
11:58 - learn is definitely Java
12:00 - okay so yes Java and JavaScript sounds
12:05 - similar they're not really that related
12:07 - at all that much maybe a little bit I
12:09 - don't know the details exactly but you
12:10 - can pretty much treat them as completely
12:12 - different languages okay just know that
12:14 - they sound similar but they're actually
12:15 - distinct okay so just ignore the names
12:17 - it should be named something different
12:18 - in my opinion but maybe there's some
12:20 - like connection that I don't know about
12:21 - but it's never been relevant to me so I
12:22 - mean it's probably not relevant to you
12:24 - because it's not good coding eight years
12:25 - but the reason I go into Java is because
12:28 - actually this was my first language that
12:30 - I learned when I was in undergraduate in
12:32 - college it's a very academic language
12:34 - and the reason for that is I think it's
12:36 - an interesting middle ground I still
12:37 - think pythons better to learn first but
12:39 - Java is not bad the reason being is it's
12:43 - a little bit easier to use but it's not
12:44 - super low level but you still get up
12:46 - your hands a little bit dirty with some
12:47 - other things that are really important
12:49 - with software development in general
12:52 - things like compiling or like typing
12:54 - your data I'm gonna explain these a
12:56 - little bit briefly so you understand
12:57 - what they mean but you don't have to
12:58 - worry about this in Python okay and a
13:01 - little bit in JavaScript but not as much
13:02 - like python is like non-existent you
13:04 - have to worry about it javascript a
13:05 - little bit but the Java is like a bit
13:07 - more and then like if you go like to see
13:08 - or C++ you have to like handle all of it
13:10 - like crazy but let's not worry about
13:12 - that for focusing on Java
13:13 - so what typing is is like when you have
13:15 - data in your code then you might want to
13:17 - oh we got a little doggie here spooked
13:21 - me but my Kingston so typing and a
13:28 - couple sentences is pretty much just
13:29 - like you have data in a computer okay
13:32 - but there's like different types of data
13:33 - like you might want to save though the
13:34 - word clever programmer like the phrase
13:36 - clever programmer that's data you can
13:38 - say that as a string or something or I
13:40 - might you might want to save the number
13:41 - 10 okay like those are two different
13:43 - data types that can be housed in the
13:45 - computer and then it's just represented
13:46 - I mean everything's ones and zeroes at
13:48 - like the lowest level okay it's like
13:49 - it's just circuits and electricity in
13:51 - the computer but it's structured a
13:52 - certain way so that the computer can
13:53 - understand it and in Java you actually
13:55 - have to specify these things but then
13:58 - you also have more control okay and
13:59 - things are a little bit more like you
14:01 - have more control over it versus Python
14:03 - where you don't have to even worry about
14:04 - this stuff
14:05 - I'm also compiling your code so like I
14:07 - said like computers runs on one and zero
14:08 - ones and zeros like you should probably
14:09 - know that if you don't Ben well now you
14:13 - do something like the you read of your
14:15 - code right those writing code which is
14:16 - just words like literally just words you
14:18 - get but you could write code in like a
14:19 - text document like like Microsoft Word
14:21 - or pages if you're on Mac or just like
14:22 - whatever anything you could write code
14:24 - on paper it's just letters and numbers
14:25 - okay string together but then how does
14:27 - the computer understand that what you
14:29 - have to do is you have to take the code
14:31 - that you wrote and then you run a
14:33 - program that interprets and reads that
14:34 - and changes that to ones and zeros
14:36 - pretty much it goes through multiple
14:37 - levels but that's called compiling your
14:39 - code into something that the computer
14:40 - will understand it's like here's a bunch
14:42 - of ones and zeros right all these ones
14:44 - and zeros so you don't have to worry
14:46 - about that in Python like everything is
14:47 - just it just runs nice and cleanly so
14:49 - you don't worry about these low-level
14:50 - like nasty things but it's very
14:52 - important that you do learn them to be a
14:54 - full fledged software developer and
14:56 - that's why I think Java should be third
14:57 - and not first because it was little bit
14:59 - frustrating for me and it's just like
15:00 - uglier and there's more like
15:02 - weird use cases and it's just like look
15:04 - it is very good for being portable which
15:06 - means which is a word we use in software
15:08 - element that you can code one program in
15:11 - Java and it can run on many different
15:13 - things so you can run it on a computer
15:14 - like all windows a Mac a phone a smart
15:18 - TV a refrigerator like those kinds of
15:19 - things um it's very portable because it
15:22 - can be portable to different platforms
15:23 - like those things okay it's like the
15:25 - internet of thing the Internet of Things
15:26 - I mean most of those actually coded and
15:27 - see so that's a bad example but it's
15:29 - just an example that like Java is very
15:31 - portable more portable than some other
15:33 - languages alright so one other thing is
15:36 - Java is actually a language that you can
15:39 - use to do android mobile development so
15:42 - mobile development is a little bit more
15:44 - advanced you definitely want to i
15:48 - somebody's walking by a little girl yeah
15:51 - Java you can actually use it for Android
15:52 - mobile development I mean Colin has
15:54 - taken over in recent years but you can
15:56 - still use Java to get your hands dirty
15:57 - in mobile and you definitely want to
15:59 - learn how to do native mobile
16:01 - development because you could do things
16:02 - like using web apps and stuff to make a
16:04 - kind of hybrid mobile app but if you're
16:06 - gonna be serious about mobile
16:07 - development you definitely want to learn
16:09 - how to actually code on the local
16:10 - platform because when you're making an
16:13 - app you want it to be as high quality as
16:14 - possible you don't want this like
16:15 - wishy-washy hybrid thing okay so it'll
16:17 - it'll work for some things but like true
16:20 - mobile development you're gonna want to
16:21 - let me get into it honestly you should
16:23 - probably learn Carlin in Finnegan's
16:24 - Android or Swift you want to get into
16:25 - iOS or flutter which is up and coming
16:28 - one it still needs to be able to be a
16:30 - little bit more established but I mean
16:31 - if you know Java and I think it's still
16:33 - the best language to learn third to
16:35 - learn all these things like memory
16:36 - management and low blow and things then
16:39 - at least you can go down that Avenue a
16:41 - little bit and then you might want to
16:42 - pick up Swift or something on the line
16:43 - but I think after you've learned Java
16:45 - you'll be like you have so much
16:47 - experience in coding after you learn all
16:48 - these languages that you can really make
16:49 - your own decisions you can start
16:50 - learning frameworks tours endless
16:52 - trademarks you'll never learn them all
16:53 - you might have a job ready you might be
16:55 - in school but like I think your path
16:57 - from this point on will be just kind of
16:58 - very self defined you'll define it
17:00 - yourself I think that sums it up pretty
17:02 - much for Java it's a little bit it's
17:05 - more of like a legacy kind of language
17:06 - very academic based you can also use
17:08 - Java for interviews it's very useful if
17:10 - you need to pass things like on using
17:12 - leak
17:12 - but I'll probably use like Python over
17:15 - Java just because it's better but I mean
17:16 - you have the option like if you if you
17:18 - just happen to like Java better then you
17:20 - can definitely use those bleep code is a
17:23 - website just check it out it's a very
17:24 - good place to like practice how to get
17:26 - past coding interviews if you want to
17:28 - get jobs at faint companies like
17:29 - Facebook Google Netflix Apple whatever
17:31 - you want like anything big Microsoft etc
17:34 - Instagram snapchat so yeah so Java is
17:38 - definitely number three and lastly I
17:40 - just want to mention that the reason I
17:43 - didn't put anything more modern in a
17:45 - 2020 up-to-date programming language
17:47 - video is because I actually don't think
17:49 - it's a good idea to learn new languages
17:52 - first when you're a beginner because
17:54 - there isn't as much support on the
17:56 - Internet so yeah flutter is really cool
17:57 - I think like learning flutter first
17:59 - could be good so it could be super cool
18:00 - learning Swift first could be super cool
18:02 - and fun but it actually doesn't set you
18:04 - up best to understand coding as a whole
18:06 - and everything these language these
18:09 - three languages are extremely well
18:10 - established they're all decades old
18:12 - already and and the reason for that
18:13 - reason I say that is when you have an
18:16 - issue with one of these languages you
18:18 - can look it up on Google and find an
18:20 - answer all right if you have a flutter
18:21 - issue and you're like oh what is this
18:22 - bug the chances of you finding a
18:24 - solution are much much lower than if
18:27 - you're like Cody and Java when you're
18:28 - like oh this thing happened because
18:29 - there's just so much more history and
18:31 - then like in on the planet regarding
18:33 - these languages yeah and there's also
18:34 - developer communities and there's just
18:36 - like there's so much more resources so
18:37 - many more books so many more projects
18:38 - that are out there someone you have more
18:40 - open source things so many more forums
18:42 - it's just it's older it's more
18:43 - well-established I mean I think you get
18:44 - the idea but I choose these because you
18:46 - should start with these and then once
18:48 - you have these under wraps like you've
18:49 - kind of like paid your dues you know
18:50 - you've gone through rite-of-passage then
18:52 - you can go like learn dart and flutter
18:54 - and Swift and all these cool badass
18:55 - things or you can go crazy and go learn
18:57 - and C and C++ and do some really crazy
19:00 - high-performance computing stuff so you
19:01 - can like really crunch numbers and do
19:03 - some crazy algorithms and stuff but
19:05 - that's really advanced before you get
19:07 - into that stuff I would actually
19:08 - recommend doing learning other things
19:09 - that are very important in software
19:11 - development things like
19:13 - Theory learning algorithms and data
19:15 - structures which are actually just ideas
19:17 - that we implement in code it doesn't
19:18 - matter what language you use like you
19:19 - can you can implement like a sorting
19:21 - algorithm in any language so you're
19:23 - actually going to need
19:24 - - you'll probably be learning these
19:25 - along the way as you're learning the
19:26 - languages but you probably want to learn
19:28 - those before you learn like 70 languages
19:30 - if you know these three like you have
19:31 - like a really strong core you can
19:33 - probably land a lot of jobs as a
19:34 - freelancer or as a full-time developer
19:36 - but you want to learn those other things
19:38 - first so I just go through those really
19:40 - quick so you kind of have like awareness
19:42 - of everything that you need as a
19:43 - software developer so like I said you
19:45 - need to know algorithms which is like
19:46 - sorting okay like how do you sort a list
19:48 - of numbers like oh you removing the
19:50 - numbers around and which way you have to
19:52 - know like in your head like what is the
19:54 - mathematical things you would do and
19:56 - then you implement it in your code - how
19:57 - to UM to do that or another thing is
20:00 - data structures so like how do you
20:02 - structure your data so one could just be
20:03 - like a list of numbers is very simple
20:05 - okay just like an ordered list of
20:07 - numbers like they're in order and
20:08 - they're there together or maybe you want
20:10 - to have a tree which is like you have
20:12 - one number and then um then you can go
20:14 - down and then there's two numbers
20:15 - connected to that and then you go down
20:17 - more and then this is how like you could
20:19 - like you can map a family tree or
20:20 - something in this way using a data
20:21 - structure like that so there's different
20:23 - ways to organize your data because like
20:25 - in a list you could just go straight
20:26 - through and that's pretty much it but a
20:27 - tree you could go down like a different
20:29 - specific leg so it's a very high-level
20:31 - explanation of what a data structure is
20:34 - but you're gonna have to learn these
20:35 - things in order to actually get things
20:38 - done like you need you need to use data
20:39 - structures to implement algorithms and
20:41 - so they kind of go hand in hand so you
20:43 - definitely do know both of those things
20:45 - alright and you're also gonna want to
20:47 - learn some things like get so git is a
20:49 - thing where you can do version control
20:51 - and what version control means is when
20:53 - you're working on a big codebase on a
20:55 - team or on your own personal project
20:57 - that whenever you you want to have like
20:59 - one working set of code so like you have
21:01 - this application whatever it is a mobile
21:02 - app online app video game whatever
21:04 - you're working on and it works okay but
21:06 - like you want implement the new feature
21:08 - so when you're starting working on the
21:09 - new feature you're gonna want to be like
21:11 - make a copy of it and then and then work
21:13 - on it and make sure it's working and
21:15 - then implement it and then ship it to
21:16 - all the customers or deploy it or
21:18 - something but now you have two versions
21:19 - of code you see so you could actually
21:21 - roll back to this one if the new one
21:22 - gets screwed up if you make a mistake or
21:24 - something completely crashes then you
21:25 - have like a basically a time machine and
21:27 - you keep you can keep going back in your
21:28 - code so it's a way to like save versions
21:32 - of code that's why it's called version
21:33 - control you
21:33 - control over the version of the code and
21:35 - using that you definitely gonna need to
21:38 - know that after these after you're
21:40 - learning languages alright and you're
21:42 - gonna have to know a few other things
21:43 - too ok if you want to be a full-fledge
21:45 - fully fledged software developer you're
21:47 - gonna want to learn about dependencies
21:48 - which is how you like like your program
21:51 - is gonna require different frameworks
21:52 - and libraries and things that other like
21:54 - other code that other people have
21:56 - written and then you're gonna have to
21:57 - like import it into your program because
21:58 - you're not gonna write everything from
21:59 - scratch you just keep you're using like
22:00 - other people's frameworks other people's
22:02 - libraries because like you don't want to
22:03 - code everything from scratch it's kind
22:05 - of silly but you're gonna need to know
22:07 - how to like make sure that this is all
22:09 - correct so that as a full package you
22:11 - have like your the thing that you worked
22:12 - on and then all your frameworks and
22:13 - libraries and other pieces of code that
22:15 - you had and maybe like some images and
22:16 - stuff and you don't know how to like put
22:18 - it all in together into one hole so that
22:20 - it's an actual full like full
22:21 - application so it has everything it
22:23 - needs to run and then you can actually
22:24 - ship that so that's like considered a
22:26 - fully shippable application or something
22:28 - and then with that of course you can
22:30 - have like fully version fully built
22:32 - versions in version control I get I said
22:34 - earlier but you're gonna need to know
22:35 - that and to know that you're gonna need
22:37 - to know command line okay so what the
22:39 - hell is command line command line is a
22:41 - way to talk to the computer so instead
22:43 - of like oh you're like with your mouse
22:45 - and you're clicking on buttons and
22:46 - you're dragging things around it looks
22:47 - pretty command line is like the lowest
22:50 - level way you can talk to your computer
22:52 - so basically it's like oh do this thing
22:55 - copy this file over here and this is how
22:57 - computers were run in the 80s like you
22:59 - could only use a computer keyboard and
23:01 - then write certain commands and hit
23:02 - enter so there's a bunch of different
23:04 - commands they're very ugly and
23:05 - old-looking but you need to know how to
23:06 - do it to use git you need to you need to
23:09 - know how to do it to download frameworks
23:10 - do this to do everything I mean
23:12 - eventually I think we'll get away from
23:13 - command-line like way down the line
23:15 - maybe but actually probably not it's
23:17 - probably gonna be around like to some
23:19 - extent forever but I mean like a lot of
23:21 - frameworks you can just download from
23:22 - the website it's just like hey it's done
23:23 - it's there but I mean a lot of stuff you
23:24 - have to go through command-line so
23:26 - that's a completely owned topic topic on
23:28 - its own but you're definitely gonna need
23:29 - I'm definitely gonna need to know it in
23:31 - addition to programming languages and
23:33 - all the theory and algorithms and data
23:34 - structures etc and that's kind of the
23:37 - one of the last things oh one other
23:39 - thing is api's so api's are just kind of
23:43 - another way to use other people's code
23:45 - online so like
23:45 - if you want to use YouTube's code like
23:47 - if you wanna make an application that
23:48 - can post YouTube comments manually like
23:50 - through the program then you need to
23:52 - like access their API so it's kind of
23:54 - like a framework kind of like a library
23:55 - in the sense that you're using somebody
23:57 - else's code to achieve something but
23:58 - you're giving me to learn to UM you're
24:00 - gonna need to learn about api's as well
24:02 - so definitely look into that and the
24:04 - very very last thing that I want to say
24:06 - is once you have all this you're gonna
24:09 - need to know how to write a freaking
24:10 - resume and make a portfolio so that you
24:12 - can get jobs at companies or land
24:15 - clients as a freelancer alright so
24:18 - you're gonna need to know how to format
24:19 - your resume you're gonna need you're
24:21 - gonna need to know how to traverse the
24:24 - social media and LinkedIn and stuff like
24:25 - that how to email people I mean you
24:28 - probably have a lot of these skills
24:29 - already if you're just a human that's
24:30 - been on the internet but just mentioning
24:33 - it you're getting to know that and all
24:35 - you definitely want to build some
24:36 - projects on your own not school projects
24:38 - build your own projects using these
24:39 - languages like build build a cool
24:41 - website build a cool full-size web app
24:42 - build a cool mobile app build a cool
24:45 - whatever whatever you want and then just
24:48 - put these into a portfolio have try to
24:50 - have like one big project that you work
24:51 - on for months and once I can do
24:52 - something amazing and maybe some small
24:53 - ones whatever just have something
24:56 - together so that you can actually apply
24:58 - everything you've learned and actually
24:59 - get the job to make this useful unless
25:01 - you're just doing it for fun then yes
25:03 - through the resume screw the job just
25:04 - have fun coding but that's pretty much
25:06 - it for the three languages that I think
25:08 - you should learn first in that order so
25:10 - let's go over a quick quick recap all
25:12 - right so the first thing we should learn
25:13 - is Python alright it's very very easy
25:15 - and clean to use there's nothing you
25:16 - have to worry about anything very
25:17 - high-level you can implement things very
25:18 - quickly you can do leak code you can get
25:20 - jobs at Fame and stuff you can do web
25:22 - development okay you can do data science
25:25 - you can do numeric stuff and like number
25:27 - crunching with Python it's great okay so
25:29 - definitely that first and the second
25:30 - language you want to learn is definitely
25:32 - JavaScript but you need to learn HTML
25:34 - and CSS before that learn it in that
25:35 - order that makes the most sense and the
25:37 - reason is because 50% or more of all
25:40 - software developer jobs are web
25:42 - development jobs and javascript is the
25:44 - language of the web so you are gonna
25:46 - want to learn how to make full stack web
25:48 - apps with javascript and everything okay
25:50 - there's a lot of frameworks great
25:51 - frameworks you can do everything
25:52 - you want with JavaScript and it makes a
25:54 - killer combo with Python and then third
25:55 - is jobless so that you gain a better
25:58 - deeper understanding of how computers
25:59 - actually work but not too deep so that
26:01 - it's like boring and nasty and too
26:03 - confusing but just enough to sell you
26:05 - that you're aware of what's actually
26:06 - happening so you're not just like hey
26:07 - run program make program you actually
26:09 - have to go into the details to
26:11 - understand stuff plus you can get a
26:12 - little bit of mobile development in
26:13 - there okay and then all the other stuff
26:15 - I would mention like algorithms data
26:16 - structures version control what else did
26:18 - I say command line dependencies api's
26:21 - and resume writing and portfolios okay
26:23 - so those are all very important things
26:25 - oh and compiling and stuff too and like
26:27 - all these ideas you need to know all
26:29 - these things to be equipped to be a
26:31 - software developer so with all that said
26:33 - that was a lot of information I'm glad
26:35 - if you got to the end but now you're
26:37 - kind of equipped with the context that
26:39 - you need to become a software developer
26:41 - and to kind of just pursue your own path
26:43 - just take this information and just
26:45 - start start with Python if you have a
26:47 - Mac it's already downloaded all right or
26:49 - go to the website and download Python 3
26:51 - Python 2 is going out of there like not
26:53 - continuing support soon so just go to
26:54 - Python 3 figure out if that's downloaded
26:56 - you stackoverflow or something that's a
26:59 - website where community developers can
27:00 - interact and ask questions they did a
27:02 - lot of good quest a lot of good answers
27:04 - there you just start okay

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up you guys aaron here from clever programmer calm and in this video we're going to be going over the top three programming languages that you should learn in 2020 if you're a beginner alright so I'm gonna be going through this video based on a big assumption and that is that you are new to coding or you're a complete beginner or something because if you're advanced and experienced I don't know why you'd be here besides entertainment hopefully you enjoy it but to get actually bite value out of this kind of topic I think you probably need to be a beginner so I'm just gonna go on that assumption alright if you don't know me I am a software developer here at clever programmer I've been here for about a year now I'm a currently a Georgia Tech graduate student studying AI yeah I just want to take my stab at this top three programming language on video because a lot of the other ones that I see it kind of just say like hey these are the top three languages for these reasons blah blah blah just go pick one and go do it alright but for me I kind of want to make something a little bit more comprehensive for a beginner so instead of Oh top three and then pick these and go whatever I'm actually gonna pick three languages that I think you should learn first and in a specific order to fully set you up to be a software developer when they want to be a freelancer or a fulltime developer or whatever so I'm actually gonna be giving you like a roadmap as a beginner and I think that's actually the best I'll also be giving a little bit of context with things because I know you're a beginner so like when I use certain words I'll explain a little bit I'm just enough to kind of so you're not fully confused but I'm not gonna be going into depth I'll just be focusing on the languages and why they're good you might get it a little bit lost with some of the words but just follow along and take my word for and hopefully why the end of it you'll understand why I think this is the best roadmap for you and then right after this video just jump in and start coding alright that's why you're here right so without any further ado let's get started before we get started though Before we jump into it I want to tell you that we have an epic free threepart master class it teaches you how to go from being a complete beginner and programming not knowing anything if you've never written a single line of code and the steps you can take to become a sixfigure freelancer or a software developer so if you want to learn how to go from there to there click the link in the description down below it should be down there just gonna pop in your email address in your name and it will send you an email to the login page for that and you can access it completely for free and it ends with a an exclusive webinar if you want to check that out too after the three parts so if I guess it's kind of like a four part master class but I definitely check it out all right it'll it's just a lot of free value and just we want to offer that to you so check it out all right you guys so I want to let you know that this video is sponsored by Skillshare Skillshare is a website kind of more like a community of creatives and intellectuals that can create courses for each other okay so you go in there and then you can post your courses whatever you can take courses um you can actually sign up as an instructor but I mean usually you'd be taking the courses yourself but you can go in there and you can learn things on any topic pretty much anything really I mean eat including like software development so you can learn things like there's some Java courses and there's probably JavaScript courses as well as Python courses if you want to go through there you can learn other things like photography and like pretty much anything that you want but basically it's just a community where you can really dive into your passions no matter what industry it's in whatever hobby you have and you can just go in and check it out okay so there's a bunch of fair just go check it out they just rebranded their whole website looks really clean and nice it was different like last month right it was like different last month what looks great now so go check it out is like nice and juicy and fresh for 2020 profs the skill shell for that it's pretty cheap too like I think there is subscriptions for like less than 10 bucks a month or something if you want to do that however because you're watching this video and because they're a sponsor if you click the link in the description then you can actually get to three months to completely free months of premium membership to really explore whatever creative endeavor is that you're interested in in your life okay so I mean doesn't hurt just try out two three months and yeah just click on the link in the description you're good to go so check out Skillshare so programming language number one the first one I think you should learn if you're beginner is definitely definitely Python okay so python is a very general purpose very clean very minimalistic very easy highlevel language and basically what that means is it's just very beginner friendly okay so most of my classes at Georgia Tech right now I'm actually using Python for whatever it is just because it's you can get your ideas into code the fastest you'll have to worry about like computer e stuff there's like no you don't have to like allocate your memory like other program languages you actually have to be like hey save this much memory like save one megabyte of memory over here like save this and then I'm gonna put like a few numbers in there okay cool save it for later do some computations over here in this memory and then come back and beg to get it back and then wipe it clean like you have to do that manually like Oh allocate this and that like in C or C++ but pipe or in a little bit less so in other languages like as you get more higher level up but Python is the most high level one and clean and just the best to use all right it's the best one to get your hands to do back oh and you can learn all about like the biggest ideas and programming and then you'll just kind of have like a big overall understanding of what programming really is and then you can go forward with that so another another great thing about Python is once you know Python I mean if you know the basics then I mean it's kind of useless to be honest like you it's you can do things but to actually like be a fullblown developer after programming languages you must learn further things like frameworks libraries and other things like algorithms and how to connect to api's and how to do version control which is like saving copies of your code like so you can go back and like how to develop on a team like there's so many other things passed just learning a programming language that you need to know to actually be successful as a developer once you know Python it's really cool because with Python you can do so many things you can do web development with frameworks like Django or flats all the framework is I'll explain really click if you don't know what that word means it's just you learn Python you have these things like how do you code in Python like core Python and then on top of Python they add like more like code things that you have to learn but it's in Python so you understand how everything works but there's just like some extra stuff piled on to it it's like advanced Python I guess and then within that framework you can develop even more cool things but like before you can learn the framework you gotta learn the language so you can do web development with Python but you can also do a lot of data science things and scientific computing with libraries like numpy which is like numeric Python or Syfy which is like science Python or pandas which is a library where you can do a lot of like number crunching or data science like machine learning you can use pi torch or tensorflow and latin frameworks like those libraries like those to do things down the road so once you know Python you're basically set up to branch out to things down the road once you have gotten a little bit more experience so Python is definitely the best start with that oh and the last thing also it's great for coding interviews because if you want to get a job at a big tech company like a fain company then Python is a very popular language to do the coding interviews is because you can implement things very quickly cleanly and they accept Python it's very wellestablished alright alright so that was the first one Python if you want to shortcut your path on actually making a profit with Python then we have a free threepart master class on how you can go from zero to six figures potentially with as a Python full stack web developer jump in there it's free just check it out we also have free Python courses on our own channels and you'll learn Python you can learn from us for free ok we have multiple courses as a twenty twenty one go check it out I'm in a lot of that check it out you can learn the Python basics there so yeah just check out that stuff we a lot we have a lot of stuff on Python that's kind of what this channel is about so go learn it and yeah now we're gonna be going onto the next language so after you're done learning Python okay uh you might want to branch into my view framework or two of here if you're curious but if you just went on start learning a second language which I actually think is a good idea because then you can kind of understand the general idea of programming you're not just like stuck in like oh Python write these words and letters and numbers and I can do this thing oh I understand this but then if you understand how to do the same thing like if you can write the same program in Python and a second language then you your brain starts understanding coding as a whole instead of just oh I get Python it's oh I get coding which is actually what you want because there's always new languages coming up but I think this is the best course to go so going on the programming language number two this is going to be JavaScript so after you're done learning Python okay javascript is number two and the reason for that is because javascript is a language of the web okay it's a programming language that is deeply ingrained in like the Internet so on webpages like rub pages are ran on JavaScript herbs anything animated or anything like interactive on a webpage or website it's run by JavaScript okay and another thing that you should know is like 50% or more of all developer jobs or web development so if you want to get a job as a software developer you're gonna need web development okay you're going to have JavaScript you're gonna need to know this to be actually be able to succeed this is because probably like a lot of like business and other things and things that the things that run the world like they want it to be online like businesses want websites people want to be able to distribute things across the internet and everything so everything is webbased now it's gonna be going more and more there so you're definitely gonna want to learn JavaScript okay one caveat though to JavaScript is you will not understand JavaScript on me you can't like fully use JavaScript to its fullest potential if you do not know HTML and CSS okay so actually these three languages as a whole I'm actually packaging in my son for two so i a little coffee out there but you need to know HTML to know how what's what web pages are built and then CSS to make i'm CSS to know how the web pages look so you can like style them and then javascript have added functionality and code to it so you're gonna you're gonna need to know all three so actually number two and you should learn them in this order is learn HTML then CSS then JavaScript so learn Python first and then these three in that order all right what's great about JavaScript though is there are a lot of really really great frameworks that have been coming up in recent years that allow you to build full applications from using just JavaScript so there's something in some for development called full stack development and all that means is like you have a full stack to something which means like on the top you have your frontend which is like how stuff looks on the screen to the user and then like in the middle of the stack you might have like some processing and stuff and then on the bottom of the stack you might have like a database where like data is stored where you can like shuffle around data retrieve data like Instagram posts from what from from your account and then display to the screen that's the frontend but then like storing it is the backend so we have front and plus backend then you have everything is called a full stack web developer what's cool about JavaScript though is although you can do while diliman with Python or Django and flask and stuff can't be like like a fully fully fledged full stack full stack web developer if you don't know JavaScript but with JavaScript you can actually be a complete full stack web developer from end to end like from all the way down at the bottom like their string works you can use like for the for the front end on JavaScript you can use frameworks like react or angularjs or vue.js look those up if you're curious and then for your backend you can also use like something like nodejs to get it done so you can have like you can hold like some data in a database whatever you need it when I say JSA means dot JavaScript okay so these are just frameworks are gonna learn after you learn core JavaScript you can go on and learn these frameworks on top of it feel free to branch out and learn those if you're interested when you hit it but I think you should definitely definitely learn JavaScript HTML CSS and JavaScript second great after you've learned Python because it's the web is the future and it's just so versatile and Python was the limit with django and flask plus javascript and all these frameworks makes a killer killer combo so you're gonna be like set up after just learning these two languages and then I guess HTML and CSS they're not languages but they're like supplemental things that you need to learn then you will you'll be set up to be a full stack web developer and go on and one other cool thing is with these with these web frameworks and things like react native you can actually create kind of hybrid mobile apps even if you want to get into that but mobile app developments a little bit advanced so I don't want to mention that here I wouldn't recommend getting into that first it's fun but I would actually recommend going with Python first and just learning how to code on a computer before you get into like all this crazy swiss stuff or flutter or anything but on the third language i'm gonna go into i do touch on it a little bit so we're gonna get that shortly so after you have learned python and HTML and CSS and javascript if you haven't already like gotten interested and like one off to learn your own frameworks and completely forgot about this video and did your own thing I think the third language that you should learn is definitely Java okay so yes Java and JavaScript sounds similar they're not really that related at all that much maybe a little bit I don't know the details exactly but you can pretty much treat them as completely different languages okay just know that they sound similar but they're actually distinct okay so just ignore the names it should be named something different in my opinion but maybe there's some like connection that I don't know about but it's never been relevant to me so I mean it's probably not relevant to you because it's not good coding eight years but the reason I go into Java is because actually this was my first language that I learned when I was in undergraduate in college it's a very academic language and the reason for that is I think it's an interesting middle ground I still think pythons better to learn first but Java is not bad the reason being is it's a little bit easier to use but it's not super low level but you still get up your hands a little bit dirty with some other things that are really important with software development in general things like compiling or like typing your data I'm gonna explain these a little bit briefly so you understand what they mean but you don't have to worry about this in Python okay and a little bit in JavaScript but not as much like python is like nonexistent you have to worry about it javascript a little bit but the Java is like a bit more and then like if you go like to see or C++ you have to like handle all of it like crazy but let's not worry about that for focusing on Java so what typing is is like when you have data in your code then you might want to oh we got a little doggie here spooked me but my Kingston so typing and a couple sentences is pretty much just like you have data in a computer okay but there's like different types of data like you might want to save though the word clever programmer like the phrase clever programmer that's data you can say that as a string or something or I might you might want to save the number 10 okay like those are two different data types that can be housed in the computer and then it's just represented I mean everything's ones and zeroes at like the lowest level okay it's like it's just circuits and electricity in the computer but it's structured a certain way so that the computer can understand it and in Java you actually have to specify these things but then you also have more control okay and things are a little bit more like you have more control over it versus Python where you don't have to even worry about this stuff I'm also compiling your code so like I said like computers runs on one and zero ones and zeros like you should probably know that if you don't Ben well now you do something like the you read of your code right those writing code which is just words like literally just words you get but you could write code in like a text document like like Microsoft Word or pages if you're on Mac or just like whatever anything you could write code on paper it's just letters and numbers okay string together but then how does the computer understand that what you have to do is you have to take the code that you wrote and then you run a program that interprets and reads that and changes that to ones and zeros pretty much it goes through multiple levels but that's called compiling your code into something that the computer will understand it's like here's a bunch of ones and zeros right all these ones and zeros so you don't have to worry about that in Python like everything is just it just runs nice and cleanly so you don't worry about these lowlevel like nasty things but it's very important that you do learn them to be a full fledged software developer and that's why I think Java should be third and not first because it was little bit frustrating for me and it's just like uglier and there's more like weird use cases and it's just like look it is very good for being portable which means which is a word we use in software element that you can code one program in Java and it can run on many different things so you can run it on a computer like all windows a Mac a phone a smart TV a refrigerator like those kinds of things um it's very portable because it can be portable to different platforms like those things okay it's like the internet of thing the Internet of Things I mean most of those actually coded and see so that's a bad example but it's just an example that like Java is very portable more portable than some other languages alright so one other thing is Java is actually a language that you can use to do android mobile development so mobile development is a little bit more advanced you definitely want to i somebody's walking by a little girl yeah Java you can actually use it for Android mobile development I mean Colin has taken over in recent years but you can still use Java to get your hands dirty in mobile and you definitely want to learn how to do native mobile development because you could do things like using web apps and stuff to make a kind of hybrid mobile app but if you're gonna be serious about mobile development you definitely want to learn how to actually code on the local platform because when you're making an app you want it to be as high quality as possible you don't want this like wishywashy hybrid thing okay so it'll it'll work for some things but like true mobile development you're gonna want to let me get into it honestly you should probably learn Carlin in Finnegan's Android or Swift you want to get into iOS or flutter which is up and coming one it still needs to be able to be a little bit more established but I mean if you know Java and I think it's still the best language to learn third to learn all these things like memory management and low blow and things then at least you can go down that Avenue a little bit and then you might want to pick up Swift or something on the line but I think after you've learned Java you'll be like you have so much experience in coding after you learn all these languages that you can really make your own decisions you can start learning frameworks tours endless trademarks you'll never learn them all you might have a job ready you might be in school but like I think your path from this point on will be just kind of very self defined you'll define it yourself I think that sums it up pretty much for Java it's a little bit it's more of like a legacy kind of language very academic based you can also use Java for interviews it's very useful if you need to pass things like on using leak but I'll probably use like Python over Java just because it's better but I mean you have the option like if you if you just happen to like Java better then you can definitely use those bleep code is a website just check it out it's a very good place to like practice how to get past coding interviews if you want to get jobs at faint companies like Facebook Google Netflix Apple whatever you want like anything big Microsoft etc Instagram snapchat so yeah so Java is definitely number three and lastly I just want to mention that the reason I didn't put anything more modern in a 2020 uptodate programming language video is because I actually don't think it's a good idea to learn new languages first when you're a beginner because there isn't as much support on the Internet so yeah flutter is really cool I think like learning flutter first could be good so it could be super cool learning Swift first could be super cool and fun but it actually doesn't set you up best to understand coding as a whole and everything these language these three languages are extremely well established they're all decades old already and and the reason for that reason I say that is when you have an issue with one of these languages you can look it up on Google and find an answer all right if you have a flutter issue and you're like oh what is this bug the chances of you finding a solution are much much lower than if you're like Cody and Java when you're like oh this thing happened because there's just so much more history and then like in on the planet regarding these languages yeah and there's also developer communities and there's just like there's so much more resources so many more books so many more projects that are out there someone you have more open source things so many more forums it's just it's older it's more wellestablished I mean I think you get the idea but I choose these because you should start with these and then once you have these under wraps like you've kind of like paid your dues you know you've gone through riteofpassage then you can go like learn dart and flutter and Swift and all these cool badass things or you can go crazy and go learn and C and C++ and do some really crazy highperformance computing stuff so you can like really crunch numbers and do some crazy algorithms and stuff but that's really advanced before you get into that stuff I would actually recommend doing learning other things that are very important in software development things like Theory learning algorithms and data structures which are actually just ideas that we implement in code it doesn't matter what language you use like you can you can implement like a sorting algorithm in any language so you're actually going to need you'll probably be learning these along the way as you're learning the languages but you probably want to learn those before you learn like 70 languages if you know these three like you have like a really strong core you can probably land a lot of jobs as a freelancer or as a fulltime developer but you want to learn those other things first so I just go through those really quick so you kind of have like awareness of everything that you need as a software developer so like I said you need to know algorithms which is like sorting okay like how do you sort a list of numbers like oh you removing the numbers around and which way you have to know like in your head like what is the mathematical things you would do and then you implement it in your code how to UM to do that or another thing is data structures so like how do you structure your data so one could just be like a list of numbers is very simple okay just like an ordered list of numbers like they're in order and they're there together or maybe you want to have a tree which is like you have one number and then um then you can go down and then there's two numbers connected to that and then you go down more and then this is how like you could like you can map a family tree or something in this way using a data structure like that so there's different ways to organize your data because like in a list you could just go straight through and that's pretty much it but a tree you could go down like a different specific leg so it's a very highlevel explanation of what a data structure is but you're gonna have to learn these things in order to actually get things done like you need you need to use data structures to implement algorithms and so they kind of go hand in hand so you definitely do know both of those things alright and you're also gonna want to learn some things like get so git is a thing where you can do version control and what version control means is when you're working on a big codebase on a team or on your own personal project that whenever you you want to have like one working set of code so like you have this application whatever it is a mobile app online app video game whatever you're working on and it works okay but like you want implement the new feature so when you're starting working on the new feature you're gonna want to be like make a copy of it and then and then work on it and make sure it's working and then implement it and then ship it to all the customers or deploy it or something but now you have two versions of code you see so you could actually roll back to this one if the new one gets screwed up if you make a mistake or something completely crashes then you have like a basically a time machine and you keep you can keep going back in your code so it's a way to like save versions of code that's why it's called version control you control over the version of the code and using that you definitely gonna need to know that after these after you're learning languages alright and you're gonna have to know a few other things too ok if you want to be a fullfledge fully fledged software developer you're gonna want to learn about dependencies which is how you like like your program is gonna require different frameworks and libraries and things that other like other code that other people have written and then you're gonna have to like import it into your program because you're not gonna write everything from scratch you just keep you're using like other people's frameworks other people's libraries because like you don't want to code everything from scratch it's kind of silly but you're gonna need to know how to like make sure that this is all correct so that as a full package you have like your the thing that you worked on and then all your frameworks and libraries and other pieces of code that you had and maybe like some images and stuff and you don't know how to like put it all in together into one hole so that it's an actual full like full application so it has everything it needs to run and then you can actually ship that so that's like considered a fully shippable application or something and then with that of course you can have like fully version fully built versions in version control I get I said earlier but you're gonna need to know that and to know that you're gonna need to know command line okay so what the hell is command line command line is a way to talk to the computer so instead of like oh you're like with your mouse and you're clicking on buttons and you're dragging things around it looks pretty command line is like the lowest level way you can talk to your computer so basically it's like oh do this thing copy this file over here and this is how computers were run in the 80s like you could only use a computer keyboard and then write certain commands and hit enter so there's a bunch of different commands they're very ugly and oldlooking but you need to know how to do it to use git you need to you need to know how to do it to download frameworks do this to do everything I mean eventually I think we'll get away from commandline like way down the line maybe but actually probably not it's probably gonna be around like to some extent forever but I mean like a lot of frameworks you can just download from the website it's just like hey it's done it's there but I mean a lot of stuff you have to go through commandline so that's a completely owned topic topic on its own but you're definitely gonna need I'm definitely gonna need to know it in addition to programming languages and all the theory and algorithms and data structures etc and that's kind of the one of the last things oh one other thing is api's so api's are just kind of another way to use other people's code online so like if you want to use YouTube's code like if you wanna make an application that can post YouTube comments manually like through the program then you need to like access their API so it's kind of like a framework kind of like a library in the sense that you're using somebody else's code to achieve something but you're giving me to learn to UM you're gonna need to learn about api's as well so definitely look into that and the very very last thing that I want to say is once you have all this you're gonna need to know how to write a freaking resume and make a portfolio so that you can get jobs at companies or land clients as a freelancer alright so you're gonna need to know how to format your resume you're gonna need you're gonna need to know how to traverse the social media and LinkedIn and stuff like that how to email people I mean you probably have a lot of these skills already if you're just a human that's been on the internet but just mentioning it you're getting to know that and all you definitely want to build some projects on your own not school projects build your own projects using these languages like build build a cool website build a cool fullsize web app build a cool mobile app build a cool whatever whatever you want and then just put these into a portfolio have try to have like one big project that you work on for months and once I can do something amazing and maybe some small ones whatever just have something together so that you can actually apply everything you've learned and actually get the job to make this useful unless you're just doing it for fun then yes through the resume screw the job just have fun coding but that's pretty much it for the three languages that I think you should learn first in that order so let's go over a quick quick recap all right so the first thing we should learn is Python alright it's very very easy and clean to use there's nothing you have to worry about anything very highlevel you can implement things very quickly you can do leak code you can get jobs at Fame and stuff you can do web development okay you can do data science you can do numeric stuff and like number crunching with Python it's great okay so definitely that first and the second language you want to learn is definitely JavaScript but you need to learn HTML and CSS before that learn it in that order that makes the most sense and the reason is because 50% or more of all software developer jobs are web development jobs and javascript is the language of the web so you are gonna want to learn how to make full stack web apps with javascript and everything okay there's a lot of frameworks great frameworks you can do everything you want with JavaScript and it makes a killer combo with Python and then third is jobless so that you gain a better deeper understanding of how computers actually work but not too deep so that it's like boring and nasty and too confusing but just enough to sell you that you're aware of what's actually happening so you're not just like hey run program make program you actually have to go into the details to understand stuff plus you can get a little bit of mobile development in there okay and then all the other stuff I would mention like algorithms data structures version control what else did I say command line dependencies api's and resume writing and portfolios okay so those are all very important things oh and compiling and stuff too and like all these ideas you need to know all these things to be equipped to be a software developer so with all that said that was a lot of information I'm glad if you got to the end but now you're kind of equipped with the context that you need to become a software developer and to kind of just pursue your own path just take this information and just start start with Python if you have a Mac it's already downloaded all right or go to the website and download Python 3 Python 2 is going out of there like not continuing support soon so just go to Python 3 figure out if that's downloaded you stackoverflow or something that's a website where community developers can interact and ask questions they did a lot of good quest a lot of good answers there you just start okay
