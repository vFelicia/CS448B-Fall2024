00:00 - I found this new voice Ai and it blows
00:02 - gp4 out of the
00:04 - water I can express more than 70
00:06 - emotions and speaking Styles like
00:08 - Whispering or impersonate a pirate a hor

01:29 - Windows 2000 oh brilliant damn the
01:32 - corporate Enterprises you know giving
01:34 - you those old ass computers locking you
01:37 - down okay nice I feel like I I yeah go
01:41 - go for it I have a plug in modem wow
01:44 - you're super well equipped J that's
01:47 - impressive
01:49 - okay that was crazy how he was about to
01:52 - speak and then he heard the AI speaking
01:54 - and then he goes uh go ahead that was
01:57 - crazy I got to watch that one more time
01:58 - that was absolutely freaking mind
02:00 - blowing go for
02:02 - it okay nice I feel like I yeah go go
02:06 - for it I have a plugin modem wow you're
02:09 - super well equipped Jay dude that is
02:14 - crazy that is coming so close to being
02:17 - able to have such good authentic
02:19 - realtime conversations I mean there's a
02:21 - couple of other AI tools I know of like
02:24 - there's another one called play AI their
02:26 - voice model is so damn good too and you
02:29 - guys could try this one as well but you
02:32 - could pick whichever AI you want hey I'm
02:34 - Judy the voice of
02:36 - play hi Judy how are you
02:41 - doing hey Cindy I'm doing great thanks
02:44 - for asking how about
02:46 - you um hold on let's so I'm going to end
02:48 - this conversation and what I will do
02:50 - actually is um we'll Shuffle and we'll
02:53 - talk to somebody else so let's talk to
02:55 - Steve Jobs Here
03:01 - good morning what's on your mind hey
03:03 - Steve I'm making a YouTube video for my
03:06 - audience for my channel clever
03:10 - programmer that sounds exciting what
03:13 - aspect of your YouTube video are you
03:15 - focusing on
03:16 - today um I just was wondering if maybe
03:19 - you have a message for my audience you
03:21 - know they're developers and they want to
03:23 - have a better career in in the field so
03:26 - what kind of um advice would you have
03:28 - for them
03:30 - developers aiming for a successful
03:31 - career should focus on Innovation and
03:33 - Relentless pursuit of
03:34 - Excellence damn that is awesome Steve
03:37 - keep going Steve my
03:40 - bad no
03:41 - worries I'm here to inspire hold on one
03:44 - second one second Steve so um so Steve
03:47 - I'm demoing to them something really
03:49 - cool so I'm G to I'm going to end the
03:51 - conversation with Steve but you guys saw
03:52 - how every time I inter interrupt him he
03:55 - actually is listening to my Interruption
03:57 - he gets interrupted and then he comes
03:59 - back so these models already exist you
04:01 - can play with them and if I wanted to
04:02 - share this recording I could share this
04:03 - recording with you guys as well you guys
04:05 - would be actually able to go and hear
04:07 - this recording maybe I could put that in
04:09 - the YouTube uh link for the
04:12 - video and then it has a developer API as
04:15 - well so you guys can actually create
04:16 - your own um voice Bots with this and
04:21 - then you can bring in your own llm into
04:23 - this as well which is fantastic so you
04:25 - can maybe connect it with Sonet uh gbt
04:28 - 40 for sure
04:31 - so that's just an example of how this
04:33 - works but let's keep going with this
04:35 - keynote that's impressive okay thank
04:39 - thank you very much Jay I I feel like I
04:41 - I learned a lot about you it was it was
04:42 - brilliant talking to
04:44 - you what did the most that was
04:47 - absolutely
04:48 - fantastic I can express more than 70
04:51 - emotions and speaking Styles like
04:53 - Whispering or maybe I could sing a song
04:57 - I can sound terrif fight or impersonate
05:02 - a pirate
05:03 - to so it can represent so many different
05:07 - emotions and the voice intonations that
05:10 - it has are so great I wonder if models
05:13 - or llms like gp4 would eventually end up
05:16 - buying tools like these you know I think
05:18 - it's called kuta a um AI or caute AI I
05:22 - wonder if GPT would end up you know
05:25 - Claude would end up buying these and
05:26 - then actually using these models as um
05:31 - you know Texas speech engines within
05:33 - their own models uh continue watching
05:35 - the video by the AI grid and see how
05:39 - Moshi did for him so he actually went
05:41 - and had a chat with Moshi so let's
05:43 - listen to his
05:44 - chat yes I did hear you I'm sorry if I
05:46 - interrupted I'll try to be more
05:48 - considerate in the future what is your
05:50 - base model my base model is a large
05:52 - scale multimodal AI that was very quick
05:56 - response 0.2 milliseconds if you
05:58 - actually see the lat see here a model
06:00 - developed by
06:02 - qai can you tell me anything more about
06:04 - that model I'm happy to share more
06:05 - information about Q's
06:07 - model sure please go ahead Q's model is
06:10 - designed to process and analyze a wide
06:12 - it is so damn fast that is like you guys
06:16 - hear that right like how almost
06:18 - instantly it just starts responding to
06:21 - anything that he's asking so I would be
06:23 - very excited to try this model out the
06:26 - only other model that I've played with
06:28 - for voices is VY Ai and I did do a bunch
06:31 - of stuff with this one um but this one
06:34 - is pretty fast too I don't know if it's
06:36 - going to be I don't think it's as fast
06:38 - as Moshi but this is pretty
06:41 - good let's give it a
06:43 - try but welcome to VY I'm an assistant
06:47 - that you can talk to like a person hey
06:49 - how's it going you a to hear me are you
06:51 - able to hear
06:52 - me loud and
06:54 - clear I'm all ears hey so I'm doing a
06:57 - YouTube video
07:00 - hey so I'm doing a YouTube video for my
07:02 - audience like do you have any messages
07:04 - or words of inspiration for
07:06 - them
07:09 - absolutely um how about this don't be
07:11 - afraid to take the leap because the view
07:13 - from the top is always worth it keep
07:15 - pushing forward and remember that every
07:17 - great journey begins with a single step
07:19 - how's that for some insiration awesome
07:20 - that is awesome can you tell me a little
07:22 - bit uh that is awesome but my audience
07:25 - is a developer audience so maybe tell
07:27 - them something specific about that and
07:29 - they're to Tech as
07:31 - well ah got it for all the developers
07:34 - out there here's a little nugget of
07:35 - wisdom embrace the bugs because they're
07:37 - just hidden features waiting to be
07:39 - discovered and remember the best code is
07:41 - the one that works but the really great
07:43 - code is the one that makes you smile
07:44 - coding keep creating and keep making
07:46 - magic happen in the digital
07:48 - world damn that's actually pretty good
07:52 - um best code is the one works but the
07:54 - really good code is the one that smiles
07:55 - so thank you for that I appreciate it
07:57 - I'm going to take off now
08:00 - you're welcome good luck with your
08:02 - YouTube video and feel free to swing by

08:09 - really good voice models vapy playi they
08:12 - have apis as well I wonder how much
08:15 - better Moshi is going to be I mean the
08:18 - latency is just so low I would be really
08:20 - excited to use it unfortunately when I
08:22 - Tred to go to their website it says that
08:24 - uh we're not able to use it right now
08:27 - but if one of you guys you know who are
08:28 - watching the video have used it or able
08:31 - to use it definitely let me know I'd be
08:32 - very curious to see the type of results
08:35 - you guys get with it so that's exciting
08:38 - and I'll keep sharing more news on
08:40 - anything AI related that I find with you
08:42 - guys peace hope you enjoyed the video
08:45 - smash the like button
