00:00 - - Hey you, what is up? How's it going?
00:01 - This is Qazi from CLEVERPROGRAMMER.COM
00:03 - In this video I wanna share with you
00:05 - The Best Goal Tracking App
for aspiring Python Developers
00:10 - or developers in general.
00:12 - And like somebody said a
few days ago they're like
00:14 - "Hey Qazi, you forgot to
put 2019 in that video".
00:17 - So in this video The
Best Goal Tracking App
00:20 - For Python Developers in 2019.
00:22 - So without any further ado
lets just right into it.
00:25 - Now I've always wanted to put my own add
00:28 - at the start of my video
and at the end of my video.
00:31 - So this is gonna be super awesome.
00:32 - But I have a special announcement
and I do wanna say this.
00:35 - I've been planning to put this together
00:37 - for a really long time.
00:38 - It's finally come together.
00:39 - And it's an unbelievable program
00:41 - I'm gonna talk more about it at the end.
00:42 - I have something very
special for you okay.
00:44 - If you've ever wanted to
make your first $1,000
00:47 - from programming, coding alright.
00:50 - If you ever wanted to
learn how you can freelance
00:52 - and start earning an income from this.
00:54 - If you ever wanted to learn how you can
00:56 - ten extra productivity.
00:57 - Learn the tools strategies and framework
00:59 - to take your skills to the next level.
01:01 - And learn how to freelance with it.
01:04 - Learn how to have more time
01:06 - money, impact on this world okay.
01:09 - If you wanna be able to
do all of those things.
01:11 - Well I have a thing for you.
01:13 - I'm gonna put that at
the end of this video.
01:15 - Enjoy this video, you're gonna love it.
01:16 - And at the end, I'm gonna show you
01:19 - what are the steps you need
to take to jump on this thing.
01:21 - Let's do this.
01:22 - This app that I wanna show
you guys it's really cool.
01:25 - It's beyond just an app.
01:26 - I want you to really get this idea down.
01:28 - And then you can obviously use the app
01:32 - to make sure that this
idea is taking place
01:34 - for you as you go along.
01:35 - Now, especially as this year has started.
01:37 - You know, I've been making these videos
01:39 - on vehicle consistent, being disciplined
01:41 - having goals, tracking your goals
01:43 - and having systems and processes in place.
01:45 - So, today what I wanna give you
01:47 - is a way to actually track those goals.
01:49 - Making sure that you are moving
with it one step at a time.
01:52 - For example, one of the
goals that I'm doing
01:55 - and leveraging this
app to help me to do it
01:59 - is making a video every single day.
02:02 - So this is the continuation
of that challenge.
02:05 - This is video 12, day 12 alright.
02:08 - And I'm doing one video a day,
02:11 - so if you wanna use this
challenge to catapult yourself
02:14 - and do a coding challenge with me.
02:17 - For lets say a 30-day
coding challenge with me.
02:20 - You can add me on Instagram
02:22 - and you can follow
everything that I'm doing.
02:23 - Cause all the behind
the scenes juicy stuff
02:25 - where you can actually
get true inspiration from
02:27 - is on my Instagram @CLEVERQAZI okay.
02:30 - It's also a lot easier to
get in touch with me there.
02:32 - What you can do is you
can take a little picture
02:34 - of you coding when you're coding.
02:36 - You can say @CLEVERQAZI
02:38 - and then do hashtag
#30dayscodingchallenge or something.
02:42 - This way you can keep
yourself accountable.
02:44 - And if you tag me I'm gonna respond to it
02:46 - it's gonna help you stay
more accountable okay.
02:48 - It's just gonna help
you a little bit more.
02:49 - It's something that helped me.
02:51 - That's why I am mentioning it here okay.
02:53 - So with that said let me
continue on with this video.
02:55 - So now, you wanna be
able to track your goals.
02:58 - Add something that tracks and
helps you build that habit
03:02 - of putting in hours of
coding every single day okay.
03:05 - So if you're a beginner,
03:07 - you might wanna put in let's
say 30 minutes to an hour
03:10 - every single day if not more.
03:12 - If you also wanna put
something in like gym
03:15 - you wanna be able to do that okay.
03:16 - But there a few things that you need.
03:18 - Now let me talk about
like why this never worked
03:21 - or helped me in the past.
03:23 - So I would always get some kind of app
03:25 - or I would try to use
spreadsheets to track my goals
03:27 - or I would use paper to track my goals.
03:30 - Whatever I used the
problem a lot of the times
03:32 - I would have is that it
just didn't sit with me.
03:36 - So one, I either didn't
like the user interface
03:38 - and I didn't end up wanna doing it okay.
03:41 - I wasn't getting that dopamine
rush of wanting to do it.
03:44 - So I would
03:45 - stop.
03:46 - Other reasons why I would
stop is like I'll forget
03:48 - what the app is or how it works.
03:50 - Or was too confusing how it worked.
03:52 - Other reasons why I also stopped was cause
03:54 - it didn't have a way to
tell me how something looks.
03:58 - Or a easy way for me to
look at a chart or a graph
04:01 - and be able to know,
04:02 - oh visually I can see my data,
04:05 - I can see my progress.
04:06 - So for example, if you're
coding for 10 20 days
04:10 - and you're on a streak, you
wanna be able to hit one button
04:11 - and see your coding streak in
that entire month visually.
04:15 - Like there should be like a bar graph
04:17 - that says that you've coded
for 20 days in a row right.
04:19 - And if you're breaking that streak
04:21 - you should be able to see that as well
04:22 - and it should notify you before.
04:23 - And there all these little things
04:25 - that help you with that habit.
04:27 - But then you also want
something simple enough
04:29 - that you can use all the time.
04:31 - Now I'm not gonna tease you more about it.
04:32 - I'm gonna show you what the app is.
04:34 - So let's go back to the app okay.
04:35 - So the app as you can see,
I'm gonna show you my screen.
04:38 - The app is called DONE.
04:40 - D-O-N-E.
04:41 - It's iPhone app, you might
be able to use it for
04:44 - Android, but I don't think
there is one for Android.
04:47 - Maybe you have to find
something equivalent.
04:49 - But for iPhone this is
the app that I found
04:51 - to be an amazing app.
04:52 - Alright so,
04:53 - app is called DONE.
04:54 - And as you can see I have a
very few goals on this app okay.
04:58 - So for me, I don't have coding, cause,
05:01 - I'm pretty decent at coding.
05:02 - But more than that, I mean obviously
05:05 - I can spend the rest of
my life mastering it.
05:07 - But it's something I already enjoy doing.
05:09 - I like doing.
05:10 - I've had the habit of doing.
05:12 - I personally don't need
to put that in right.
05:14 - So what I have for example,
is I have YouTube at the top
05:17 - this way, if I do a YouTube
video, like I'm doing right now.
05:20 - What I'm gonna do is,
05:22 - I'm gonna hit this button that says two
05:24 - and right when I did it, you
can see that it looks juicy
05:28 - and now it says YouTube it
says is 1/7 complete okay.
05:31 - And I'm set it to be
like this weekly streak.
05:33 - And now if I go to the
gym, then I can hit the gym
05:36 - but I didn't so that yet.
05:38 - For my email, I wanna do one
email, four emails a week.
05:42 - And I haven't even done any today.
05:44 - And then I also wanna be
able to track my diet.
05:46 - So these are my four goals.
05:47 - For example, for yourself,
what you could put
05:50 - is let's say 30-minutes of
coding or one hour of coding.
05:54 - Put something that
you're actually gonna do
05:56 - and be consistent with okay.
05:58 - So let's say you put 30-minutes of coding
06:00 - or you could put something
like drink water alright.
06:03 - Make sure, one thing I'm
gonna tell you about goals
06:05 - is make it very simple.
06:07 - For example, I also wanna
put track my body weight.
06:11 - I also wanna put singing classes.
06:13 - I also wanna put going out.
06:16 - I also wanna put networking.
06:17 - But if I put more so many things,
06:19 - I'm probably gonna stop using this app.
06:20 - Probably gonna stop
tracking my goals okay.
06:23 - That's one important tip I wanna give you.
06:26 - Now, also what I can do, is
I can click inside of it.
06:29 - So let's say where it says
YouTube I go inside of it.
06:32 - Now obviously, I can go
here and say oh, I actually
06:36 - you know, I'm gonna go tomorrow
06:38 - or lets say I go in a past day
06:39 - and then I say I did three YouTube videos,
06:41 - but let's keep it where it is.
06:44 - I can see my goals and my streaks okay.
06:46 - So all the red ones,
you see circular ones,
06:48 - those are all the days I
made a YouTube video okay.
06:50 - I can also click this
button and visually see
06:54 - what I'm doing, how many
videos I've been making.
06:56 - And let me go back to the app real quick.
06:59 - And if I go back to the home page
07:02 - and now I hit the chart button.
07:03 - And I hit let's say, month.
07:05 - You can see that in this month of February
07:08 - you know I did one video on the first.
07:11 - I did another video on the second.
07:13 - I did a few videos on the third.
07:14 - Then I did a video on the
fourth okay, which is today.
07:17 - I went to the gym once this month so far.
07:19 - I wrote three emails.
07:20 - I did tracking my diet.
07:22 - So, you can see visually it
can show your monthly goals
07:25 - your yearly goals.
07:26 - And also makes it really easy
for you to track your goals.
07:31 - And it's literally that simply okay.
07:33 - I'm not sponsored by this app.
07:35 - They're not gonna pay me any money.
07:37 - Even if they paid me it
would've been like pennies.
07:39 - Yeah, like this affiliate stuff people do
07:41 - with coupon codes and t-shirts,
07:43 - you're not gonna make any money.
07:44 - So don't do that type of
stuff most of the times.
07:47 - But anyways, it's my way of saying
07:49 - that I'm not sponsored by them.
07:50 - It's just that amazing, that
helpful for me at least.
07:55 - I hope it is for you as well.
07:57 - Give it a try.
07:58 - Download it.
07:59 - And everyday you know,
just click that button
08:02 - keep that streak going right.
08:03 - There's something sexy about that streak.
08:05 - So if you have a streak going
you don't wanna break it.
08:07 - So you saw I had this streak of YouTube.
08:09 - And I had this streak of gym.
08:11 - I don't wanna break it,
I wanna keep it going.
08:13 - There's something satisfying about it.
08:15 - And what I wanna do is I
wanna build to gamify my life.
08:18 - Make it so interesting and exciting
08:19 - when I get these dopamine rushes
08:21 - from the successful things I do right.
08:22 - Like for example, why is
gambling so addicting?
08:26 - Why is doing stuff that is
not good for you so addicting?
08:29 - Why is video games so addicting right?
08:31 - Why is playing World of
Warcraft so addicting?
08:34 - Well, why is going on
Instagram or Facebook
08:36 - looking for notifications so addicting?
08:38 - Yet, when it comes to doing
the really right stuff
08:41 - to have a successful life.
08:42 - To become a successful
profitable developer.
08:45 - To become jacked in the gym.
08:47 - To be better at relationships.
08:49 - To have a better dating life.
08:50 - Why does that not seem addicting?
08:53 - Why does that not wanna
make you wake up faster
08:56 - work harder, work longer, achieve more?
08:58 - And just have more fun,
08:59 - why doesn't it give you
those dopamine rushes right?
09:02 - Why do you need such
strong whys to do them?
09:04 - So I've always wanted
to like gamify the right
09:07 - things that I do in my life.
09:08 - So I get these
09:10 - (host smacks his skin)
09:11 - like how you know, like
some kind of crack addict
09:13 - who just wants to just inject himself.
09:15 - (grunts)
09:16 - I want to be able to feel that.
09:18 - I know somebody said you look
really good when you do that
09:22 - you know you look like a pro.
09:24 - But I haven't done it in real life
09:25 - so I wouldn't know how it works,
09:26 - but I've just seen enough videos.
09:28 - And what I wanna say is
09:29 - I wanna essentially feel that rush
09:32 - of like I'm getting high on life.
09:35 - And so this is one day
for me to do it okay.
09:39 - I go here and I hit a streak and I'm like
09:41 - oooh
09:41 - oooh
09:42 - oooh.
09:43 - And I'll go on Instagram
09:45 - and I'll you know post date two streak
09:46 - or day five streak.
09:48 - And give myself these
little dopamine rushes
09:51 - to essentially do the
things that keep me on track
09:53 - and make me successful.
09:55 - And if I keep doing
this, you're gonna see.
09:57 - And I'm committing to this.
09:58 - But you're gonna see that this year
10:00 - the YouTube channel is
gonna freaking explode baby.
10:04 - And we're gonna have lots of courses
10:06 - coming from Clever Programmer.
10:07 - Lots of awesome stuff coming for free.
10:09 - And it's gonna be essentially
all because of setting goals
10:13 - tracking habits, being disciplined,
10:15 - being structured having a vision.
10:17 - And one tiny way to do that
10:18 - is getting this app for example DONE.
10:21 - Or having some way for you
to just do it manually right,
10:23 - even if legal pad helps you.
10:26 - So with that said this video
is all about emphasizing
10:28 - the power of having a goal.
10:30 - Setting some kind of
discipline structure around it.
10:32 - Getting yourself to feel
those dopamine rushes
10:35 - as you achieve those goals.
10:36 - Making success
10:38 - feel like it's a drug.
10:40 - And just you know enjoying life.
10:43 - Enjoying life while crushing
it at the same time.
10:46 - So I hope you crush 2019.
10:47 - I hope that you have one of
the best years of your life.
10:50 - Cause I know I will.
10:52 - And with that said, I
love your beautiful face
10:55 - and as always Thank you

11:30 - to making $104,000 a year as a developer.
11:33 - What would it mean for you
11:35 - if you made your first $1,000 from coding.
11:38 - What would it mean for
you if I reveal to you
11:41 - my step my step system
11:43 - that I use
11:44 - to go from being completely broke
11:47 - to then learning how to
code in just a few months.
11:50 - Landing my contract as a
Freelancer with Python.
11:54 - And being able to make
$20,000 while I was a terrible
11:59 - Oakton Community College student.

a $130,000 contract
12:44 - and now he's moved to
Germany with his family
12:46 - and living an amazing life.

Cleaned transcript:

Hey you, what is up? How's it going? This is Qazi from CLEVERPROGRAMMER.COM In this video I wanna share with you The Best Goal Tracking App for aspiring Python Developers or developers in general. And like somebody said a few days ago they're like "Hey Qazi, you forgot to put 2019 in that video". So in this video The Best Goal Tracking App For Python Developers in 2019. So without any further ado lets just right into it. Now I've always wanted to put my own add at the start of my video and at the end of my video. So this is gonna be super awesome. But I have a special announcement and I do wanna say this. I've been planning to put this together for a really long time. It's finally come together. And it's an unbelievable program I'm gonna talk more about it at the end. I have something very special for you okay. If you've ever wanted to make your first $1,000 from programming, coding alright. If you ever wanted to learn how you can freelance and start earning an income from this. If you ever wanted to learn how you can ten extra productivity. Learn the tools strategies and framework to take your skills to the next level. And learn how to freelance with it. Learn how to have more time money, impact on this world okay. If you wanna be able to do all of those things. Well I have a thing for you. I'm gonna put that at the end of this video. Enjoy this video, you're gonna love it. And at the end, I'm gonna show you what are the steps you need to take to jump on this thing. Let's do this. This app that I wanna show you guys it's really cool. It's beyond just an app. I want you to really get this idea down. And then you can obviously use the app to make sure that this idea is taking place for you as you go along. Now, especially as this year has started. You know, I've been making these videos on vehicle consistent, being disciplined having goals, tracking your goals and having systems and processes in place. So, today what I wanna give you is a way to actually track those goals. Making sure that you are moving with it one step at a time. For example, one of the goals that I'm doing and leveraging this app to help me to do it is making a video every single day. So this is the continuation of that challenge. This is video 12, day 12 alright. And I'm doing one video a day, so if you wanna use this challenge to catapult yourself and do a coding challenge with me. For lets say a 30day coding challenge with me. You can add me on Instagram and you can follow everything that I'm doing. Cause all the behind the scenes juicy stuff where you can actually get true inspiration from is on my Instagram @CLEVERQAZI okay. It's also a lot easier to get in touch with me there. What you can do is you can take a little picture of you coding when you're coding. You can say @CLEVERQAZI and then do hashtag #30dayscodingchallenge or something. This way you can keep yourself accountable. And if you tag me I'm gonna respond to it it's gonna help you stay more accountable okay. It's just gonna help you a little bit more. It's something that helped me. That's why I am mentioning it here okay. So with that said let me continue on with this video. So now, you wanna be able to track your goals. Add something that tracks and helps you build that habit of putting in hours of coding every single day okay. So if you're a beginner, you might wanna put in let's say 30 minutes to an hour every single day if not more. If you also wanna put something in like gym you wanna be able to do that okay. But there a few things that you need. Now let me talk about like why this never worked or helped me in the past. So I would always get some kind of app or I would try to use spreadsheets to track my goals or I would use paper to track my goals. Whatever I used the problem a lot of the times I would have is that it just didn't sit with me. So one, I either didn't like the user interface and I didn't end up wanna doing it okay. I wasn't getting that dopamine rush of wanting to do it. So I would stop. Other reasons why I would stop is like I'll forget what the app is or how it works. Or was too confusing how it worked. Other reasons why I also stopped was cause it didn't have a way to tell me how something looks. Or a easy way for me to look at a chart or a graph and be able to know, oh visually I can see my data, I can see my progress. So for example, if you're coding for 10 20 days and you're on a streak, you wanna be able to hit one button and see your coding streak in that entire month visually. Like there should be like a bar graph that says that you've coded for 20 days in a row right. And if you're breaking that streak you should be able to see that as well and it should notify you before. And there all these little things that help you with that habit. But then you also want something simple enough that you can use all the time. Now I'm not gonna tease you more about it. I'm gonna show you what the app is. So let's go back to the app okay. So the app as you can see, I'm gonna show you my screen. The app is called DONE. DONE. It's iPhone app, you might be able to use it for Android, but I don't think there is one for Android. Maybe you have to find something equivalent. But for iPhone this is the app that I found to be an amazing app. Alright so, app is called DONE. And as you can see I have a very few goals on this app okay. So for me, I don't have coding, cause, I'm pretty decent at coding. But more than that, I mean obviously I can spend the rest of my life mastering it. But it's something I already enjoy doing. I like doing. I've had the habit of doing. I personally don't need to put that in right. So what I have for example, is I have YouTube at the top this way, if I do a YouTube video, like I'm doing right now. What I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna hit this button that says two and right when I did it, you can see that it looks juicy and now it says YouTube it says is 1/7 complete okay. And I'm set it to be like this weekly streak. And now if I go to the gym, then I can hit the gym but I didn't so that yet. For my email, I wanna do one email, four emails a week. And I haven't even done any today. And then I also wanna be able to track my diet. So these are my four goals. For example, for yourself, what you could put is let's say 30minutes of coding or one hour of coding. Put something that you're actually gonna do and be consistent with okay. So let's say you put 30minutes of coding or you could put something like drink water alright. Make sure, one thing I'm gonna tell you about goals is make it very simple. For example, I also wanna put track my body weight. I also wanna put singing classes. I also wanna put going out. I also wanna put networking. But if I put more so many things, I'm probably gonna stop using this app. Probably gonna stop tracking my goals okay. That's one important tip I wanna give you. Now, also what I can do, is I can click inside of it. So let's say where it says YouTube I go inside of it. Now obviously, I can go here and say oh, I actually you know, I'm gonna go tomorrow or lets say I go in a past day and then I say I did three YouTube videos, but let's keep it where it is. I can see my goals and my streaks okay. So all the red ones, you see circular ones, those are all the days I made a YouTube video okay. I can also click this button and visually see what I'm doing, how many videos I've been making. And let me go back to the app real quick. And if I go back to the home page and now I hit the chart button. And I hit let's say, month. You can see that in this month of February you know I did one video on the first. I did another video on the second. I did a few videos on the third. Then I did a video on the fourth okay, which is today. I went to the gym once this month so far. I wrote three emails. I did tracking my diet. So, you can see visually it can show your monthly goals your yearly goals. And also makes it really easy for you to track your goals. And it's literally that simply okay. I'm not sponsored by this app. They're not gonna pay me any money. Even if they paid me it would've been like pennies. Yeah, like this affiliate stuff people do with coupon codes and tshirts, you're not gonna make any money. So don't do that type of stuff most of the times. But anyways, it's my way of saying that I'm not sponsored by them. It's just that amazing, that helpful for me at least. I hope it is for you as well. Give it a try. Download it. And everyday you know, just click that button keep that streak going right. There's something sexy about that streak. So if you have a streak going you don't wanna break it. So you saw I had this streak of YouTube. And I had this streak of gym. I don't wanna break it, I wanna keep it going. There's something satisfying about it. And what I wanna do is I wanna build to gamify my life. Make it so interesting and exciting when I get these dopamine rushes from the successful things I do right. Like for example, why is gambling so addicting? Why is doing stuff that is not good for you so addicting? Why is video games so addicting right? Why is playing World of Warcraft so addicting? Well, why is going on Instagram or Facebook looking for notifications so addicting? Yet, when it comes to doing the really right stuff to have a successful life. To become a successful profitable developer. To become jacked in the gym. To be better at relationships. To have a better dating life. Why does that not seem addicting? Why does that not wanna make you wake up faster work harder, work longer, achieve more? And just have more fun, why doesn't it give you those dopamine rushes right? Why do you need such strong whys to do them? So I've always wanted to like gamify the right things that I do in my life. So I get these (host smacks his skin) like how you know, like some kind of crack addict who just wants to just inject himself. (grunts) I want to be able to feel that. I know somebody said you look really good when you do that you know you look like a pro. But I haven't done it in real life so I wouldn't know how it works, but I've just seen enough videos. And what I wanna say is I wanna essentially feel that rush of like I'm getting high on life. And so this is one day for me to do it okay. I go here and I hit a streak and I'm like oooh oooh oooh. And I'll go on Instagram and I'll you know post date two streak or day five streak. And give myself these little dopamine rushes to essentially do the things that keep me on track and make me successful. And if I keep doing this, you're gonna see. And I'm committing to this. But you're gonna see that this year the YouTube channel is gonna freaking explode baby. And we're gonna have lots of courses coming from Clever Programmer. Lots of awesome stuff coming for free. And it's gonna be essentially all because of setting goals tracking habits, being disciplined, being structured having a vision. And one tiny way to do that is getting this app for example DONE. Or having some way for you to just do it manually right, even if legal pad helps you. So with that said this video is all about emphasizing the power of having a goal. Setting some kind of discipline structure around it. Getting yourself to feel those dopamine rushes as you achieve those goals. Making success feel like it's a drug. And just you know enjoying life. Enjoying life while crushing it at the same time. So I hope you crush 2019. I hope that you have one of the best years of your life. Cause I know I will.

I have an incredible video that I want you to go and see that I've put together okay. This video is unbelievable. This video will show you how I went from being a dumb broke Oakton Community College student to making $104,000 a year as a developer. What would it mean for you if you made your first $1,000 from coding. What would it mean for you if I reveal to you my step my step system that I use to go from being completely broke to then learning how to code in just a few months. Landing my contract as a Freelancer with Python. And being able to make $20,000 while I was a terrible Oakton Community College student. And to then being able to live the lifestyle I want on my own terms. And have the ability to have my own time freedom money. And have the ability to make an impact on the world. And at the same time, travel with my friends. Be there for my family. You know when we hit 300,000 subscribers. Go to all these events. Even now I'm in Miami at 10X Growth Con. with Grand Cardone. How does that lifestyle come about? As a Python Developer, I was able to create that lifestyle for myself. And in this video, I wanna show you that how you can do that for yourself. Take students like for example John Navarro who went from working with me, from complete zero to becoming a Senior Data Scientist. Or Nazar Mally who landed a $130,000 contract and now he's moved to Germany with his family and living an amazing life. Or Afrin Shaik who was able to make $20,000 after she took one of our programs. But before we continue I do wanna talk about the opportunity that exists in 2019 and moving forward as a Python Developer. So please go watch this video. It's a epic video I've put together.
