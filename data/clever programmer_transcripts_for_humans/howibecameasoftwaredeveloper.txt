00:17 - i want to talk to you about how i became
00:20 - a six figure
00:21 - developer how i became a full stack
00:24 - developer
00:25 - how i came from ukraine from with
00:27 - nothing and my parents came from ukraine
00:29 - with nothing
00:30 - and how i learned how i taught myself
00:34 - and the things that i did to lead me to
00:37 - where i am right now
00:38 - which is a six-figure developer but also
00:40 - some who also is a teacher now at this
00:42 - point
00:43 - so just a little backstory behind me is
00:46 - you know i'm from ukraine you know
00:48 - my parents you know i mean i'm from
00:50 - ukraine was born there
00:51 - uh and i came here to america at the age
00:53 - of nine you know we won a green card we
00:55 - were very lucky to do that
00:56 - and you know we fully sold the business
00:59 - back in ukraine that we had
01:01 - and fully just transferred here with
01:02 - literally five nothing but 500
01:04 - in our bank account where we just had
01:07 - cash that's pretty much
01:08 - it it was a scary time you know like we
01:10 - literally did not
01:11 - have much at all um my parents didn't
01:14 - know english i didn't know english the
01:15 - only thing i could talk
01:16 - was like only the only thing i could say
01:18 - was pretty much you know where's the
01:19 - bathroom that's all i could say at that
01:21 - point
01:22 - um and honestly that's it
01:25 - but i saw potential i saw a future
01:28 - and you know and i continued to learn
01:30 - and continue to grow
01:32 - my parents were struggling my my dad
01:34 - worked 18 hours a day
01:36 - at a car wash my mom worked 15 hours a
01:38 - day
01:39 - uh cleaning houses it was a hard time
01:41 - for for all of us
01:43 - and we literally lived at our friend's
01:45 - house and our small room
01:47 - um because we couldn't get our apartment
01:48 - we didn't even have a have a car
01:50 - also as well so that was back when i was
01:52 - nine years old i'm currently 25
01:54 - and honestly a lot has changed at 25 i'm
01:57 - now a teacher
01:58 - i get to teach thousands of students and
02:00 - coding and
02:02 - my parents have a business and it's and
02:03 - it's been awesome
02:05 - but how do we get to this how i you know
02:09 - was able you know not only learn english
02:11 - but
02:12 - you know make a career go to college
02:16 - you know and so forth and actually land
02:19 - the jobs
02:20 - and become a developer that i am now
02:24 - well all kind of started with high
02:25 - school honestly back in high school
02:27 - um honestly you know the hardest part
02:29 - for me was initially was english so i
02:31 - couldn't learn english initially
02:32 - i know i just i was kind of like
02:34 - learning a bunch of things but the
02:35 - problem was that
02:36 - it just wasn't sinking in i'm not sure
02:38 - why but for some reason that was the
02:40 - case
02:41 - um and it wasn't until i think you know
02:43 - eighth or ninth grade
02:44 - i realized i'm holy [ __ ] like i finally
02:46 - understand it i remember
02:48 - literally seventh grade i remember
02:50 - myself reading a chapter three to four
02:52 - times because
02:53 - because it was not sinking in and i had
02:55 - a test the next day
02:57 - and i was just crying my mom was beside
02:59 - me the whole time she was trying to
03:00 - translate it for
03:01 - with me together but you know i had to
03:04 - end up have to reread
03:06 - the same thing over and over again
03:07 - because it just wasn't sinking in until
03:08 - like i think eighth grade
03:09 - like i said eighth or ninth grade when
03:11 - things got a lot easier
03:13 - um then high school started and
03:14 - everything honestly changed you know
03:17 - uh with that i i kind of understood
03:19 - english now i could speak properly
03:22 - um and the biggest thing for me was
03:26 - it was it was actually like it was
03:28 - sinking in this time finally for some
03:29 - reason
03:30 - right and that high school was
03:34 - high school was the first time that i
03:36 - actually started to actually good grades
03:38 - uh because the middle school is getting
03:40 - c's d's you know and so forth mainly
03:42 - because of my
03:43 - again because of my english but then
03:46 - high school started and everything
03:47 - changed
03:48 - and there was one class that honestly
03:50 - changed everything for me
03:52 - and it was a web design class and
03:55 - and this was the same class was where i
03:57 - got to build websites you know and
04:00 - we were using dreamweaver at that time
04:02 - and it was it was a lot of
04:03 - fun and i actually got really
04:06 - really really interested in something
04:08 - like this i got really interested in
04:09 - building websites
04:10 - now we were not using like crazy
04:12 - javascript or react gs or anything like
04:13 - that
04:14 - we were just using a very simple dreamer
04:17 - with a javascript and html and css
04:19 - that's honestly pretty much it and we
04:21 - were building pages by pages by pages
04:24 - but honestly i loved it like
04:27 - i love the aspect of taking something
04:30 - that
04:31 - i personally i had an idea about
04:34 - and put it into reality for many people
04:37 - to use
04:38 - imagine you had this idea right and now
04:40 - you have thousand people using it's like
04:42 - facebook
04:43 - facebook so many people are using it now
04:44 - because it came from an idea
04:46 - and you were able to develop it that to
04:48 - me
04:49 - was probably one of the coolest things
04:51 - that i thought of
04:53 - i thought of myself as an inventor and i
04:56 - still do
04:58 - right and so can i started from there
05:01 - um i took that course just by chance i
05:03 - was like you know what i'm not trying to
05:04 - figure this out see how it is and i
05:06 - i loved it and my teacher as well she
05:08 - was very very inspirational too
05:10 - every single time we'll get to that
05:11 - class she would always put on an
05:13 - inspirational quote or inspirational
05:15 - video to inspire us
05:16 - and honestly i have i have a lot to
05:18 - thank her
05:19 - i don't really know forget i forget her
05:21 - name but i will find out at some point
05:22 - i have a lot to thank for her for what
05:25 - she has done to me
05:26 - because she inspired me very very much
05:30 - she inspired me so much actually because
05:33 - literally i kept taking the exact same
05:35 - class over and over and over again
05:36 - because
05:37 - that was the only class that was
05:38 - available you know for the high school
05:41 - and so i kept asking him like listen can
05:43 - i we take it again and again and again
05:45 - again every single semester and of
05:47 - course should allow me
05:49 - and it came to a point where i couldn't
05:50 - even register for the normal class so i
05:52 - end up basically just registering
05:54 - through like kind of like actually
05:55 - coming to her she had to sign a waiver
05:58 - and then i had to go back to the
05:59 - principal's office and then that's the
06:00 - only way they could put me in
06:02 - but at that point it was too late
06:05 - because all the seats were taken right
06:08 - and so
06:08 - what i end up having to do which is
06:10 - really funny is
06:11 - i end up having to actually have to
06:14 - learn
06:15 - in a closet there was a small closet by
06:17 - the class
06:18 - and that's where i learned because more
06:21 - all the seats were taken
06:23 - you know because from the students i
06:24 - could actually register
06:26 - but that doesn't stop me i was hungry
06:28 - like i want to learn i found a lot of
06:31 - interest in this and literally what
06:33 - happened is
06:34 - you know i bought my own laptop actually
06:36 - my parents bought my laptop was my first
06:37 - laptop that they bought me
06:39 - school is a sony some sony something i'm
06:41 - not remember for sure
06:42 - but i bought my laptop and that's left i
06:44 - brought in every single day
06:45 - and i went to the closet and i literally
06:48 - just worked there
06:49 - and i didn't work on the projects that
06:51 - were usual projects for the class but i
06:53 - actually was the assistant of the
06:54 - teacher at this point i was actually
06:55 - just building projects from scratch
06:57 - at this point right and and it kind of
06:59 - got started from there honestly it was
07:01 - it was really really cool and
07:03 - uh i started to fall in love with the
07:05 - art of creation something of
07:07 - creating a
07:11 - of creating an application right and
07:14 - one time my senior year my last year of
07:17 - high school i decided you know
07:19 - let's go out there with a bang let's do
07:22 - this
07:22 - you know and so here's what i did i
07:25 - didn't tell the teacher
07:27 - but i ended up actually building
07:29 - rebuilding the whole high school's
07:31 - website
07:32 - from scratch with a new design without
07:35 - even telling her
07:37 - yeah i'll build this in about maybe i'll
07:39 - say about a month
07:41 - it took me and i brought it to her i'm
07:43 - like listen teacher is look
07:44 - look at check this out imagine this is a
07:46 - laptop like look check this out here's
07:47 - here's the website and she was like
07:51 - holy [ __ ] right she was surprised
07:55 - because
07:56 - i didn't tell her about it but she loved
07:59 - it
08:00 - she loved what i did and guess what
08:04 - this website came out to be
08:08 - this went live i ended up working with
08:11 - another student to make it fully
08:12 - functional make it mobile friendly and
08:14 - everything
08:15 - and this website was live for the high
08:18 - the whole high school
08:19 - literally for three years straight i'm
08:21 - not kidding
08:22 - for three years straight this was the
08:24 - the website that was live
08:26 - at on the high school the high school
08:29 - was called warren my high school
08:32 - and i have everything to thank that
08:34 - teacher the web design class
08:36 - the reason to where i am today now
08:39 - that was the start right that was the
08:41 - start of how things got started
08:43 - because of that design class i realized
08:45 - that's what i wanted to do that's what i
08:46 - love to do
08:47 - and so i was like you know what that's
08:48 - where i'm going to get my college degree
08:49 - from i worked really hard
08:51 - i got good grades you know and you know
08:53 - and i got scholarships and so i went to
08:56 - a university
08:57 - you know i went to university of
08:58 - michigan dearborn and
09:00 - it was it was a pretty good university
09:02 - and
09:03 - but the thing i realized however is that
09:06 - literally about you know a quarter in
09:09 - or you know my first semester in i
09:10 - realized that i wasn't gonna get what i
09:12 - wanted
09:13 - like real real world experience i wasn't
09:16 - gonna get that from in university
09:17 - unfortunately
09:18 - so the first literally the first the
09:21 - first semester i started searching for
09:23 - like
09:23 - okay what are some of the opportunities
09:25 - out there like what can i do what can i
09:27 - find at opportunities other experiences
09:29 - i started building my own websites i
09:31 - started building my own little blogs
09:32 - i was i built this my own blog called
09:34 - techhelp.org it's not existing anymore
09:36 - don't worry don't don't even go on there
09:38 - but right but this is my own blog
09:41 - and and it was crazy like you know and i
09:43 - was building like page by page using
09:45 - dreamweaver not even using like
09:47 - some crazy php it was literally just
09:49 - using dreamweaver and it wasn't even you
09:51 - using a database it wasn't until later
09:54 - on that
09:54 - i realized what a database is i can
09:55 - actually use a database you know to to
09:57 - populate data
09:58 - um
10:02 - but i'll kind of get started from there
10:03 - and then one time i went to creative
10:05 - computing club
10:06 - and this creative club was very
10:09 - interesting and i
10:10 - met uh these friends they're called
10:12 - robert and steve
10:14 - and i met them i saw them do something
10:16 - really cool they're doing like an
10:17 - application
10:18 - it was a application at the time called
10:20 - trendala and this application the whole
10:22 - point was like to bring
10:24 - all these different like you know uh
10:26 - websites now
10:27 - like for example pandora amazon you know
10:31 - zara you know zappos all these clothing
10:34 - stores to bring them together
10:36 - into one application right
10:39 - called trindala you swipe left to
10:41 - dislike swipe right to like it's as
10:43 - simple as that you can actually
10:44 - search up on google you will see what it
10:45 - means it doesn't exist anymore don't
10:47 - worry about it
10:48 - but and it was really cool i was like
10:50 - holy [ __ ]
10:51 - guys can i help you out somehow and
10:54 - again i knew
10:55 - barely nothing that was like listen i
10:57 - was willing to work for free
11:01 - and they're like okay i mean sure if you
11:03 - want to help i'll help out
11:05 - sure sure and so what they end up doing
11:06 - is they end up giving me like a small
11:08 - little project to do which is to build a
11:09 - python scraper
11:11 - and you know based on how i built it
11:12 - they would actually you know you know
11:13 - then
11:14 - i'll work with them and and then they
11:16 - tell me to build a python script and
11:18 - then the first thing i did
11:19 - when i went home was i'm literally like
11:22 - you know
11:23 - what is python like what is
11:26 - python that's literally what what i
11:29 - typed into google
11:30 - and then i'm like okay build a scraper
11:32 - in python that's the second thing i
11:33 - typed into google right so
11:35 - and i realized more and more as i
11:36 - learned i realize you can build you know
11:39 - a scraper you know with beautiful soup
11:41 - and stuff like that
11:42 - and so that's what i did and so i
11:43 - literally stayed up blue for two nights
11:45 - straight
11:45 - non-stop no sleep whatsoever i stayed
11:48 - there for two nights straight
11:50 - building a python scraper using
11:52 - beautiful soup
11:54 - and you know what i did it i built it
11:57 - i sent it back to them they later get a
11:59 - response
12:00 - they're like bro let's go
12:03 - let's do it and and so yeah i end up
12:06 - kind of joining
12:07 - this little there's a group of people
12:08 - it's a stephen robert
12:10 - they they're one of my they're amazing
12:12 - friends i still have
12:13 - i still talk with it talk to them and
12:17 - and the thing is the cool part is is and
12:20 - so i continued to work with them
12:22 - and they were my mentors they were the
12:25 - reason
12:26 - kind of like that gave me that jump
12:28 - start
12:29 - and honestly i am so thankful for them
12:32 - and for what they have done
12:34 - for me um robert one of the guys
12:37 - he is a very technical guy and he was
12:39 - building scrapers because one of one of
12:41 - the things that we had to do was
12:42 - we had to build a lot of scrapers like
12:44 - you know amazon scraper
12:46 - zappos scraper you know scrapers that
12:48 - will
12:49 - scrape a bunch of websites then take
12:51 - data and then that's what you would use
12:53 - and he would mentor me like he would
12:55 - always be there to you know when i asked
12:57 - had to ask questions and so forth
12:59 - and would literally within two to three
13:01 - weeks like
13:02 - like i would you know i'll go from not
13:04 - do knowing anything to actually building
13:06 - my own
13:07 - scraper python scraper with scrapey
13:10 - and jingle and we had a whole database
13:14 - in my sql database in the back end
13:16 - we had our own server it was insane and
13:20 - and i learned so much like literally
13:21 - within a month i i just like my
13:23 - growth just skyrocketed and it was all
13:27 - because of them
13:28 - because of robert because of steve steve
13:30 - he taught me more
13:31 - on the business side of things right so
13:33 - he taught me more the project management
13:34 - he's
13:35 - because he's a great product manager
13:37 - right
13:38 - and i learned how to lead team
13:41 - and and so forth and we got to a point
13:44 - where
13:45 - we had this application running is a
13:46 - trendable application it was so cool and
13:48 - everything
13:50 - and you know we and then we tried to
13:51 - market it and you know as developers who
13:54 - we are we're not the best marketers
13:55 - unfortunately
13:56 - so i know some some are i'm not saying
13:58 - everybody but some are just not the best
14:00 - marketers
14:00 - we were not the best market as well
14:02 - should have to say and so we like we
14:03 - went to this uh electric forest
14:06 - thing where and we painted like 200
14:08 - shirts like we bought 200 shirts
14:10 - to market our application and it was
14:12 - called what was it called
14:13 - electric fashion called forest fashion
14:15 - like hashtag forest fashion you know
14:17 - then tag us for i said first fashion for
14:19 - and so forth and
14:21 - like thinking back i'm like what the
14:22 - hell we're thinking you know but
14:24 - but i literally have this picture of us
14:26 - literally
14:27 - outside the office we worked and we had
14:30 - 200 shirts that we bought white shirts
14:32 - and we were literally we stenciled out
14:34 - you know this picture says trandala
14:36 - and forest fashion and we would just
14:38 - paint it
14:40 - 200 shirts the whole day non-stop like
14:43 - like
14:44 - i don't know what were we thinking i
14:45 - don't know honestly but
14:47 - but we did it and
14:50 - and so you know we did 200 shirts and
14:53 - then we went to wendell chuck forest and
14:55 - we got responses
14:58 - one response
15:01 - we got one person tagging us on
15:04 - instagram
15:05 - with the hashtag forest fashion
15:09 - and then tagged us on instagram with the
15:11 - trend attack i don't know i don't know
15:12 - anything like i said
15:13 - uh you know like it's okay but it was
15:16 - fun indeed
15:17 - you know then i end up basically what
15:19 - i'm doing is like we continue doing that
15:21 - then we actually actually
15:22 - we kind of switched to a different
15:23 - product then we end up working with
15:25 - someone
15:26 - else like actually just like a contract
15:28 - to help them out
15:29 - and the whole time also then we i worked
15:31 - as a mentor for another group of people
15:33 - like
15:34 - it was a capstone project people back in
15:36 - my old university so
15:37 - at this point i was basically you know
15:40 - only my sophomore year but i was already
15:41 - teaching people who were finished up
15:43 - college which was insane so i was
15:45 - leading a group of people quicking up
15:46 - college and that kind of gave me a lot
15:49 - of
15:50 - knowledge on leadership
15:53 - so that's the one point i want to bring
15:54 - up to you guys is you know for anybody
15:56 - here who's kind of
15:58 - hearing my story and you guys are like
15:59 - maybe you're struggling like how do i
16:00 - get started
16:01 - well one way to get started is i want
16:03 - you to keep in mind that
16:05 - you know working for free is not bad
16:07 - working for free is something you should
16:09 - not be scared of
16:10 - you know yes i work for free i work for
16:12 - free for them for a whole year and a
16:13 - half
16:14 - like i was just passionate but i'll be
16:16 - honest with you
16:18 - that year and a half was probably some
16:19 - of the funnest times i had in my life
16:21 - i'll be fully honest with you i didn't
16:23 - get paid nor do i want to
16:25 - i was very lucky to be living with my
16:27 - parents so i i didn't have to pay for
16:29 - things like you know
16:30 - like housing so i was very lucky on that
16:32 - side
16:33 - but i just remember going you know going
16:36 - to
16:37 - university going to university and then
16:39 - again driving
16:40 - right back to the office and then just
16:42 - continue to work
16:44 - i had this passion we all had this drive
16:46 - this path to just
16:47 - work and work and work and we loved it
16:50 - they loved it we all loved
16:51 - we got together we thought about how to
16:53 - make an erd diet and we thought about
16:54 - all these different things and we even
16:56 - go to professors to get
16:58 - like to get help and and it was awesome
17:02 - it was so much fun every single day was
17:04 - a ride it was like a roller coaster
17:06 - and i i had so much fun and we built so
17:09 - much
17:09 - amazing like we built so much trust
17:12 - together we built this amazing
17:14 - you know um i don't know this amazing
17:17 - environment together
17:18 - thriving environment each person just
17:20 - cared about each other and each person
17:22 - just pushed it to do better and better
17:23 - and better
17:24 - and i just i still have the state like i
17:27 - thank them so much for where i am
17:29 - because
17:30 - my skills you know were developed then
17:33 - a lot of muscular developed then um
17:36 - but then of course at that point you
17:38 - know after about a year and a half we
17:39 - almost done
17:40 - you know i decided to do something else
17:42 - then they decided something else and
17:43 - then
17:43 - we kind of moved on from though from
17:45 - that point on i now
17:47 - the cool part is though is because i
17:48 - already had the experience um
17:50 - i knew at this point how to approach
17:52 - companies and i had some good experience
17:54 - behind my back
17:55 - i had the proper mentors and so i now
17:57 - know how to get into the
17:59 - world of you know actually being paid at
18:00 - this point right and
18:02 - i started i started to apply for jobs i
18:05 - literally
18:05 - literally year and a half i think at
18:07 - this point i was you know
18:09 - junior year junior in college and i
18:10 - started to apply for these jobs apply
18:12 - for
18:13 - google facebook twitter and so forth and
18:15 - i started doing all these
18:16 - interviews and and i got a lot of
18:19 - interviews actually
18:20 - you know i got interviews with google
18:23 - they actually flew me down to california
18:25 - which is really amazing they filmed down
18:27 - all the way to california they
18:28 - the cool part they paid for the whole
18:29 - trip so it's like a free trip biscuit
18:31 - you get
18:32 - which is awesome so but the coolest part
18:35 - was like you know i was actually passing
18:37 - interviews
18:38 - and uh they flew me down and then i got
18:40 - a chance to like you know actually be an
18:42 - interview with them
18:43 - and i got to speak with a googler while
18:45 - on the interview
18:47 - now i will say the interviews are not
18:48 - easy they're hard
18:54 - so good they're really hard actually
18:57 - they're to a point of like
18:58 - i had to like learn algorithms and i
19:01 - know hackerrank
19:02 - lead code and all these other ones
19:03 - non-stop um
19:06 - but you know i just and i did and i did
19:09 - and
19:09 - and i had an interview with with twitter
19:12 - uh that was a lot of fun too
19:13 - um appellantier that was really good
19:16 - they actually flew me down as well so i
19:17 - got two trips for free
19:20 - um but that's not the goal again free is
19:22 - not the goal here the goal is to get a
19:23 - job right
19:24 - unfortunately i did not get placed into
19:26 - those roles
19:28 - uh i still got the chance to interview
19:29 - and i was really really close to being
19:31 - placed
19:32 - um and i even had of you with khan
19:35 - academy that was a lot of fun too with
19:36 - squarespace
19:37 - for khan academy i end up having to
19:39 - create like this graphql
19:40 - type structure which is really cool for
19:42 - squarespace i created this
19:44 - amazing um they asked they they had me
19:47 - create this what's it called
19:48 - what was it the name of it it was a
19:50 - machine learning algorithm
19:52 - that would predict you know the winner
19:54 - and the winner of like uh
19:56 - predict the winner of of a sender or
19:59 - something in the in the state
20:00 - i don't know i don't remember the winner
20:02 - of something
20:03 - based on data and i that's when i i
20:06 - actually had to learn machine learning
20:08 - like when they give
20:08 - the game that thing so that was a lot of
20:10 - fun too um but the point is you know
20:12 - i've gone through a lot of different
20:13 - experiences i was never afraid
20:16 - to try different things i was never
20:17 - afraid to challenge myself
20:19 - i was never afraid to just go out there
20:21 - just do and go and go and go
20:23 - and i have a lot of things to thank my
20:25 - parents because they gave me that space
20:26 - to do you know what i mean
20:28 - like i wasn't pushed to hey nas you have
20:30 - to you know go and work right now hey
20:32 - nas have to do this i was given space to
20:35 - do that
20:36 - and i was patient i was very patient and
20:39 - so that's what i want you to remember as
20:41 - well is
20:41 - you know number one like i said you know
20:43 - don't be afraid to run for free
20:45 - number two is very important be patient
20:49 - right developing sorry developing is a
20:52 - hard job
20:54 - right get into coding is a hard thing it
20:56 - takes time it takes patience
20:58 - but the cool thing is the reward is
21:01 - insane their words aren't the best are
21:04 - worse because now i get to
21:06 - get to code i get to be creative every
21:08 - day
21:09 - i get to have fun to me work is play
21:14 - right and on top of that you get to make
21:16 - money
21:18 - and on top of that now personally for me
21:20 - i get to teach and that to me is
21:22 - everything
21:23 - my mom was a teacher and i'm a teacher
21:25 - who knew
21:27 - i told my mom i'm not gonna be a teacher
21:29 - but guess what
21:30 - no i guess i am a teacher so
21:33 - i guess it runs the family but besides
21:36 - that right again did all these
21:38 - interviews and then finally i came back
21:39 - to
21:40 - came back to um uh michigan and
21:44 - and i finally called up one of my
21:45 - friends on my friends uh
21:47 - and and i'm like hey bro do you know any
21:50 - company that are hiring
21:52 - and he actually recom he was like hey
21:54 - actually now my company is hiring and
21:55 - the company is called urban science
21:57 - and he actually gave my resume to the
22:00 - company and he actually referred me
22:03 - now that's another thing is referrals
22:05 - are key in this industry
22:07 - he referred me and guess what i wanted
22:10 - for any of you
22:10 - within one day i got the job got the
22:13 - jobs as an intern as an intern
22:18 - and honestly that was cool that's the
22:20 - one thing to understand
22:21 - this is why i make such a big difference
22:22 - is build and network around yourself
22:26 - right that's part three is build a
22:28 - network around yourself
22:30 - because you know a lot of these
22:32 - companies they work based on referrals
22:34 - even google they like referrals
22:36 - you know when somebody refers to that
22:38 - puts you way higher on the list
22:40 - of you know for you to be hired same
22:42 - thing for facebook and the other company
22:44 - so build network build referrals build
22:46 - people around yourself
22:47 - right that's the first that's that's
22:49 - kind of one thing i will tell you but
22:50 - anyways i got the job
22:52 - and i was with this company and honestly
22:54 - i was liking it i was
22:55 - building things out i was building
22:56 - things with microsoft i wasn't doing
22:58 - like things with
22:59 - like angular or ajs which which is what
23:01 - i wanted to do
23:03 - but in either case they gave me this
23:05 - project which is to
23:06 - put together data from all these
23:08 - different data sources right
23:10 - and it was like millions lines of code
23:12 - millions lines of like
23:13 - database rows i had to put together data
23:16 - from
23:17 - and i did i the i had about two months
23:20 - to do it i did it within about a month
23:21 - so i actually
23:22 - made it shorter and so the rest of the
23:24 - time i was like okay well what am i
23:25 - going to do now
23:27 - and i actually decided to do something
23:28 - really cool i decided to learn machine
23:30 - learning
23:30 - while on the job how i asked of course
23:33 - i've asked a manager if i can do that
23:35 - um and so he loved it like he loved my
23:38 - enthusiasm for work and how much
23:40 - how much i worked and he's like yeah
23:41 - sure of course just just go do it
23:43 - and and i did and so i learned and so i
23:47 - went i took my first course it was from
23:50 - udacity it was a free machine learning
23:52 - class from udacity i took that course
23:54 - and i started learning about linear
23:55 - regression and you know naive bayes
23:58 - algorithms and stuff like that and
23:59 - and i and i started to apply it and i
24:01 - was like holy [ __ ] i built my first
24:03 - algorithm to machine learning
24:04 - to predict something and
24:08 - why not apply that now to this
24:12 - and uh so i did and then so
24:16 - basically on my free time i just
24:18 - basically
24:19 - end up just working on this machine
24:21 - learning algorithm
24:23 - and and it predicted can you not believe
24:26 - this
24:26 - i predicted the amount of leads that
24:29 - they are going to have
24:30 - within the next few months
24:38 - right there that was me
24:44 - no actually i know not i'm a wait i'm a
24:45 - really slow typer my tech is more like
24:49 - that's that's my type of speed but and
24:52 - anyways right so that's kind of what
24:54 - happened it was
24:54 - it was really really cool and and and
24:57 - when it came down to presentations
24:58 - because we it was an internship so when
25:00 - all these interns were presenting
25:02 - i had something different at the table i
25:06 - i presented like okay so here's what i
25:08 - did i did this this this
25:11 - but hold on i also did this and when i
25:14 - presented
25:16 - my machine learning algorithm when i
25:17 - presented you know
25:19 - how i trained 80 percent i used 80 of
25:22 - that data to train
25:23 - the rest 20 data to see my prediction
25:26 - results that are correct or not
25:28 - they were like holy [ __ ] this guy went
25:30 - above and beyond
25:33 - and guess what because of that i
25:36 - end up being asked later on to work with
25:40 - it to work
25:41 - with their machine learning team
25:45 - yeah so i ended up actually having an
25:48 - interview with machine learning team
25:49 - and they created a role for me specific
25:52 - because they didn't have a role open
25:53 - they created a role for me specifically
25:56 - so i can work with them
25:58 - how cool is that yeah so i'm
26:02 - doing that i ended up just kind of
26:03 - working with them and i joined the
26:05 - machine learning team
26:06 - and that was fun i was working with
26:08 - people who were
26:09 - like senior developers you know had
26:11 - master's degrees
26:12 - they were building machine learning
26:14 - algorithms to predict like to see if
26:16 - your signature is corr
26:17 - is like fraudulent or not they were
26:19 - building some
26:20 - epic stuff and i was having so much fun
26:24 - um yeah and i loved it i also loved it
26:28 - and then and then they offered me a job
26:31 - before i even finished college i had a
26:33 - job
26:34 - offer for sixty thousand dollars without
26:37 - even without any degree
26:38 - no degree whatsoever um
26:43 - but didn't stop there so before i get
26:47 - going that's the one thing i want to uh
26:48 - that's the i think part four i want to
26:50 - tell you is
26:51 - you know if you want to get into
26:52 - development and you want to put yourself
26:54 - out there
26:56 - take initiative take a niche to do
26:58 - things outside the box
26:59 - don't just do just what you're being
27:01 - asked to don't just do the
27:02 - standard thing okay
27:06 - go outside be creative
27:09 - do things that are gonna be really cool
27:11 - with you right
27:13 - have fun take initiative
27:16 - that is what differentiates someone who
27:19 - is going to go
27:20 - very far was gonna which is something
27:22 - who's going to go very linear
27:24 - okay so that's my little tip
27:28 - for you take [ __ ] challenges take
27:32 - action then things will be easier
27:36 - now so what happened next well basically
27:40 - i got a job offer but then before i was
27:42 - supposed to start i was supposed to
27:43 - start basically
27:44 - in no july
27:47 - before july my friend case you know
27:49 - approached me and said hey bro
27:50 - i got this cool company you know called
27:53 - service.com
27:54 - and you know and you know they're
27:56 - building this cool application
27:57 - and they're looking for developers and
28:00 - so he wanted me to go ahead and you know
28:02 - maybe potentially you know uh
28:03 - go for an interview and i did and i went
28:06 - from like okay sure why not what's the
28:07 - worst i already have a job why not go
28:08 - for another interview that's fine
28:10 - um and it went from the interview and i
28:12 - don't know
28:13 - i just love the startup environment i
28:16 - love the startup game i loved creating
28:18 - things from scratch with an idea i loved
28:20 - having a lot of impact right that to me
28:22 - was very interesting
28:23 - much more than just you know working at
28:25 - a company again nothing against that
28:27 - that's just to me is what i loved right
28:31 - and so i did that i ended up basically
28:34 - going for an interview they gave me
28:35 - another project to do i did the project
28:38 - and what happened is uh within about a
28:41 - week i got the job
28:42 - but this time they offered me seventy
28:44 - thousand dollars so not 60k so they went
28:46 - to 70k now at this point
28:48 - you know what
28:51 - i'll take it okay i like it 10k more
28:54 - plus about the job of course so yeah i
28:57 - had them telling the other company
28:58 - unfortunate that i was not able to
28:59 - continue with them
29:00 - and so i ended up going with this
29:02 - company and
29:04 - honestly it was a lot of fun it was so
29:06 - much fun and
29:08 - and i ended up just kind of you know
29:09 - working with them and so forth and we
29:11 - started working this
29:12 - this idea we started to really uh
29:15 - build this application called
29:17 - service.com and we've got this dashboard
29:19 - using angularjs
29:20 - front end and i was using jingle as well
29:22 - because i knew django
29:24 - so i was a full stack developer there
29:28 - and to me it was so much fun like we
29:30 - stay up late nights to work on stuff
29:32 - like this
29:33 - and we will fix problems and stuff i
29:35 - just know i
29:36 - love that hustle of like you know
29:38 - working in a startup company to me like
29:40 - this this whole thing of wearing a lot
29:41 - of hats
29:42 - it's always a lot of fun um
29:45 - and and and i remember those days and it
29:48 - was you know like i just
29:50 - i had an amazing team i was very
29:51 - thankful for them um
29:53 - and literally for about a year and a
29:54 - half i was working with them and uh
29:56 - really trying really hard but the year
29:58 - and a half i grew as
30:00 - so much i grew as a leader of leading a
30:02 - team
30:03 - i became really good at you know project
30:06 - management i became really good at
30:08 - you know talking to business and talking
30:11 - to the developers
30:12 - you know using diagrams and stuff like
30:14 - this and i just i realized i'm really
30:16 - good explaining things you know
30:20 - in the meantime however i was also
30:21 - putting my instagram
30:23 - yeah i was putting my instagram and and
30:27 - just because i wanted to share i want to
30:28 - share my knowledge i want to share you
30:29 - know what i was doing
30:31 - and i started with a lot of people you
30:33 - know connected with a lot of people
30:34 - in the business on instagram and
30:38 - and they connected with quasi actually
30:39 - yeah that somehow somehow happened
30:42 - um and so that's another thing that
30:44 - comes to you is like don't be afraid to
30:45 - put yourself out there
30:46 - right one of the biggest things that
30:49 - people
30:50 - will see is there are a lot of amazing
30:51 - people out there so put yourself out
30:53 - there
30:54 - linkedin instagram face whatever it
30:56 - might be
30:57 - you know just create a connection create
30:59 - network there are a lot of amazing
31:01 - people out there i know
31:02 - i know social media might not be the
31:03 - best thing sometimes but trust me if
31:05 - it's good for the right reasons
31:06 - it's a good thing to use exactly
31:09 - so end up doing that basically and um
31:13 - a year and a half into it i realized
31:15 - that i wanted to do something different
31:16 - i realized i'm like you know what
31:18 - i'm not happy with this job anymore
31:20 - unfortunately
31:22 - i wanted to i was stagnating i i was
31:25 - going up so many different
31:26 - times at this point i was like you know
31:28 - what i it doesn't feel right now at this
31:30 - point
31:31 - and and so
31:34 - i decided to quit decided to quit went
31:37 - to my boss
31:38 - and uh went to the manager went to the
31:41 - boss and i was like listen um
31:42 - sorry i'm giving you to my two weeks
31:44 - notice and so forth
31:46 - and and here's what he had to say i
31:49 - laugh at this
31:49 - to this day so listen up really quickly
31:52 - he looks at me now he's like listen son
31:54 - sit down
31:55 - and i sat down and he said to me he's
31:58 - like listen
31:59 - i'm going to tell you this as a father
32:01 - as as an employer
32:03 - as a financial advisor and as a friend
32:07 - you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] not
32:09 - your [ __ ] nuts your [ __ ] nuts wait
32:10 - this out if you have to kyle
32:14 - so and i was like wait what
32:18 - so that was really funny um he's like
32:20 - yeah why would you leave we're like
32:21 - we're about to close this deal it's
32:23 - gonna go great
32:24 - you're leaving a time when things are
32:25 - good and i was like
32:27 - yeah but i'm just not happy i want to
32:30 - try something different i'm
32:31 - i'm a go-getter i'm someone when i have
32:33 - an idea in my mind i want to go for
32:35 - i will go for it no matter what
32:39 - because i knew i know the opportunity
32:40 - lies ahead if i try
32:42 - if i don't try then i i might regret it
32:45 - later on
32:46 - to me the question i ask myself is
32:48 - always why is the alternative
32:51 - like what's the alternative to me you
32:54 - know
32:55 - try something new well the alternative
32:57 - is to keep doing the exact same thing i
32:58 - was doing before
32:59 - to make the same amount of money to
33:01 - continue stagnating
33:03 - and so forth and i was like
33:07 - that's not an alternative i'm happy with
33:09 - i don't want to do that
33:11 - and so i quit i was like listen sorry
33:13 - that's my decision
33:15 - and i did it and he's still trying to
33:17 - take me back and so forth and i really
33:18 - appreciate that
33:19 - but you know i end up actually not doing
33:21 - it and i ended up because i was wanting
33:23 - into freelancing now i got to freelance
33:25 - but here's the coolest part
33:26 - the coolest part is that because i was
33:28 - very valuable to the team
33:32 - right when i started freelancing the day
33:35 - i quit the job and i had signed my
33:36 - signature saying that i'm out that's it
33:38 - that's it
33:39 - they gave me a contract where they
33:42 - became my first client
33:44 - so right away after basically
33:48 - quitting i right away had my first
33:51 - job my first client and it was them
33:55 - so that was really cool and this gave me
33:56 - the chance to work remotely
33:59 - you know outside them and so that's what
34:01 - i did
34:03 - and i was working really hard i worked
34:04 - remote and stuff like that and
34:06 - and so on i got more clients and i got
34:08 - more clients and and
34:09 - and i'll be honest you freelancing is
34:11 - not easy i'll be honest with you you're
34:12 - right from the get-go guys
34:13 - freelancing is not an easy thing you
34:14 - feel if you think that you're going to
34:16 - be a millionaire
34:16 - as a freelancer within your next year ah
34:20 - hell no
34:25 - and that's exactly what you're doing
34:27 - unless you're in a really good business
34:29 - but it was hard like i had to learn
34:31 - client management i had to learn how to
34:32 - hire people
34:33 - had to learn how to sell i had to learn
34:35 - how to go to conferences it was
34:36 - probably one of the toughest years so
34:39 - far you know i went from working like
34:40 - literally
34:41 - you know 40 hours a week to working you
34:43 - know 70 hours a week 80 hours a week
34:45 - and i was tiring and so but i was
34:48 - growing like
34:48 - the coolest part to me is i was happy
34:50 - because i was growing i was doing
34:52 - something
34:53 - that i was in control of
34:56 - and and then something happened i went
34:59 - to a conference
35:00 - well actually before that i actually met
35:02 - qazi and
35:03 - and you know we got to do a live call
35:05 - cause i was doing live call on
35:07 - instagram at that point those times and
35:09 - i got the live call with him he
35:10 - interviewed me and i got the chance to
35:12 - just be interviewed and to speak about
35:14 - my whole experience you know as a
35:16 - developer
35:18 - and i was like holy [ __ ] this is a cool
35:20 - game
35:21 - yeah they reached out to me i don't
35:22 - remember we just started messaging
35:24 - together
35:25 - but they're like amazing gangs i'm like
35:27 - holy [ __ ]
35:29 - and i actually might do my first video
35:31 - with them my first video that i did for
35:33 - them was a video on like
35:35 - i think my building my my to-do list in
35:37 - rappel that it using django i think i
35:38 - think that was the name of it or
35:40 - something something like that i forgot
35:41 - but i made that video and i and i sent
35:43 - it to them and and that's where they
35:44 - actually it's actually live
35:46 - on cleverprogrammer i think you probably
35:47 - find it it's to-do list with django i
35:50 - think that's
35:50 - that's what it's called and that's my
35:53 - first video with them
35:54 - that's my first video in general like
35:56 - period you know
35:59 - but i had a lot of fun it was different
36:02 - than anything else
36:05 - and so what happened is very simple at
36:07 - that point what happened is that
36:09 - um after that i i kind of went to a
36:12 - conference in las vegas it was called
36:13 - popcon
36:14 - and it's usually where i get my clients
36:16 - usually when i find a client and so
36:18 - forth and that's you when i learn things
36:20 - um and from the conference i was
36:22 - supposed to go back
36:23 - to michigan but
36:27 - i assigned not to i decided to cancel my
36:31 - ticket
36:32 - i decided to get a new ticket to go to
36:34 - california
36:36 - to meet these guys to me qazi in the
36:39 - whole gang and the whole
36:40 - crew and i literally remember this day
36:42 - i'm like i arrived at the airport
36:44 - you know again this is out of spite out
36:46 - of nowhere i arrived at the airport i'm
36:47 - like hey kilgookasi um
36:49 - you know i'm in california can i stay
36:51 - here please
36:53 - and and he's like yeah sure and and so i
36:56 - ended up doing it
36:57 - i stayed his place we met you know i met
37:00 - you know frankie then
37:02 - aaron and kazi of course and
37:05 - holy [ __ ] no i think i was supposed to
37:07 - stay
37:08 - for one week in california i ended up
37:10 - staying for a whole month
37:13 - got my my own airbnb
37:16 - i know and there was just something
37:18 - where i just loved being around this
37:20 - team i loved
37:21 - thinking about content and teaching
37:23 - people and
37:24 - you know and so forth and i was working
37:28 - at the same time as a
37:29 - freelancer at the same time you know but
37:31 - i was also helping them out just just
37:33 - just just just because it was fun
37:38 - and then something happened we're like
37:39 - okay so we did a lot of stuff it's a lot
37:41 - of fun i love the crew team of people
37:43 - you know but we weren't working there
37:45 - officially together at that point on
37:48 - and then i came back to michigan i came
37:50 - back to michigan i get a call from kazi
37:52 - and qazi says
37:53 - bro let's build a javascript course
37:58 - and i'm like bro
38:01 - let's do it literally within split
38:04 - seconds i just agreed to it
38:07 - you know again i'm just the kind of a
38:09 - person that
38:10 - that just goes for what he wants that
38:13 - takes big especially at this age i'm 25
38:16 - right now
38:18 - uh this is the best stage to take risks
38:21 - it's the best day is to try different
38:23 - things because
38:24 - i feel my parents always told me you
38:25 - know you know you don't want to be you
38:26 - know later on you know in your eye
38:28 - in your life thinking that oh i wish i
38:29 - would have done this i wish i tried this
38:32 - especially when you have kids later on
38:33 - and so forth and and you're busy
38:35 - you may not have the chance to try this
38:37 - you still can but you mind that you
38:38 - this was easier right now and i was like
38:41 - yeah let's do it
38:42 - so we started doing and started doing
38:43 - other stuff we launched our course
38:45 - called profit with javascript okay
38:48 - and and then that came around and that
38:50 - was successful and so forth
38:52 - and then and then covet hit
38:57 - and then and i was like and i and
39:00 - i know i love working at this point i
39:02 - love working with the team i loved
39:04 - working on this course and building
39:06 - modules and stuff like this
39:08 - and and and i started like this more
39:11 - than my freelancing gigs
39:14 - and then so kyle was like bro what can
39:16 - we do to put you good
39:17 - do your children full time and so i did
39:21 - i went full time and it was actually
39:23 - during covet when before ko
39:24 - and kova to hit i think i think so i
39:26 - think so
39:28 - and so we went full time and that's when
39:30 - like a lot of things changed
39:31 - we started doing challenges that was a
39:33 - lot of fun we started doing
39:34 - you know uh building up the course
39:36 - builders amazing community right
39:38 - you know doing coaching calls stuff like
39:40 - that and it was so much fun
39:42 - and i loved and i've realized how just
39:44 - how much
39:46 - i loved teaching and i realized just how
39:49 - much
39:49 - i was growing as a person
39:53 - like a lot
39:57 - it was challenging correct but i [ __ ]
40:01 - loved it
40:02 - you know so and yeah
40:06 - and so that's kind of the story how can
40:08 - i went through and now circle back to
40:10 - this
40:10 - now we've done a lot more than than you
40:13 - know
40:14 - than that we built a boot camp and some
40:16 - different other things
40:17 - and now we're teaching i get to teach
40:19 - thousands of people every single day
40:21 - and i am excited for the future i'm
40:23 - excited for the future where we get to
40:24 - teach hundreds of people get to help
40:26 - so many developers become developers so
40:28 - people become developers
40:30 - and and i just i can't wait for where
40:32 - we'll go next
40:34 - but there's to come back full circle now
40:37 - you know
40:38 - from somebody who came from ukraine they
40:40 - know any english
40:42 - with parents who had only five hundred
40:43 - dollars in the in the in in
40:45 - you know in hand you know someone who
40:48 - you know gets to teach thousands of
40:50 - people around the world
40:52 - coding and i get to help my parents out
40:54 - now with money
40:57 - yeah to me that's cool
41:03 - that's pretty cool i'm pretty happy
41:05 - about that
41:08 - and i can't wait for where it takes us
41:09 - next
41:13 - so let's get a little bit emotional
41:17 - there
41:17 - because i just know because it takes a
41:19 - lot of hard work to you know it takes a
41:20 - lot of hard work sometimes you don't
41:22 - realize just how much
41:23 - work it takes to know to where you are
41:25 - right now unless you talk about it this
41:27 - is really
41:28 - really good um to actually talk about
41:31 - this
41:32 - because those days were hard so
41:36 - you know maybe hopefully you get
41:37 - something to go take something away from
41:38 - this
41:39 - maybe a lesson or two maybe you inspire
41:42 - you to maybe do coding because
41:44 - the opportunity is there it's there
41:48 - all you have to do is take the chance
41:49 - take the leap all you have to do is
41:52 - just try it all you have to do is just
41:56 - put in time and effort
41:58 - right i want you to be open be
42:00 - open-minded
42:02 - you know if you're closed-minded that's
42:04 - just not that's not gonna get you to
42:06 - where you want but
42:07 - if you're an open-minded person you know
42:08 - you try different things you
42:10 - you put yourself out there you connect
42:13 - with people
42:14 - you you know you're not afraid to take
42:16 - action
42:18 - amazing things happen amazing things
42:21 - happen
42:22 - so so on and on there

Cleaned transcript:

what is everybody hope you guys are doing amazing this is nas from cleverprogrammer and today um i just want to speak to you i want to talk to you about how i became a six figure developer how i became a full stack developer how i came from ukraine from with nothing and my parents came from ukraine with nothing and how i learned how i taught myself and the things that i did to lead me to where i am right now which is a sixfigure developer but also some who also is a teacher now at this point so just a little backstory behind me is you know i'm from ukraine you know my parents you know i mean i'm from ukraine was born there uh and i came here to america at the age of nine you know we won a green card we were very lucky to do that and you know we fully sold the business back in ukraine that we had and fully just transferred here with literally five nothing but 500 in our bank account where we just had cash that's pretty much it it was a scary time you know like we literally did not have much at all um my parents didn't know english i didn't know english the only thing i could talk was like only the only thing i could say was pretty much you know where's the bathroom that's all i could say at that point um and honestly that's it but i saw potential i saw a future and you know and i continued to learn and continue to grow my parents were struggling my my dad worked 18 hours a day at a car wash my mom worked 15 hours a day uh cleaning houses it was a hard time for for all of us and we literally lived at our friend's house and our small room um because we couldn't get our apartment we didn't even have a have a car also as well so that was back when i was nine years old i'm currently 25 and honestly a lot has changed at 25 i'm now a teacher i get to teach thousands of students and coding and my parents have a business and it's and it's been awesome but how do we get to this how i you know was able you know not only learn english but you know make a career go to college you know and so forth and actually land the jobs and become a developer that i am now well all kind of started with high school honestly back in high school um honestly you know the hardest part for me was initially was english so i couldn't learn english initially i know i just i was kind of like learning a bunch of things but the problem was that it just wasn't sinking in i'm not sure why but for some reason that was the case um and it wasn't until i think you know eighth or ninth grade i realized i'm holy [ __ ] like i finally understand it i remember literally seventh grade i remember myself reading a chapter three to four times because because it was not sinking in and i had a test the next day and i was just crying my mom was beside me the whole time she was trying to translate it for with me together but you know i had to end up have to reread the same thing over and over again because it just wasn't sinking in until like i think eighth grade like i said eighth or ninth grade when things got a lot easier um then high school started and everything honestly changed you know uh with that i i kind of understood english now i could speak properly um and the biggest thing for me was it was it was actually like it was sinking in this time finally for some reason right and that high school was high school was the first time that i actually started to actually good grades uh because the middle school is getting c's d's you know and so forth mainly because of my again because of my english but then high school started and everything changed and there was one class that honestly changed everything for me and it was a web design class and and this was the same class was where i got to build websites you know and we were using dreamweaver at that time and it was it was a lot of fun and i actually got really really really interested in something like this i got really interested in building websites now we were not using like crazy javascript or react gs or anything like that we were just using a very simple dreamer with a javascript and html and css that's honestly pretty much it and we were building pages by pages by pages but honestly i loved it like i love the aspect of taking something that i personally i had an idea about and put it into reality for many people to use imagine you had this idea right and now you have thousand people using it's like facebook facebook so many people are using it now because it came from an idea and you were able to develop it that to me was probably one of the coolest things that i thought of i thought of myself as an inventor and i still do right and so can i started from there um i took that course just by chance i was like you know what i'm not trying to figure this out see how it is and i i loved it and my teacher as well she was very very inspirational too every single time we'll get to that class she would always put on an inspirational quote or inspirational video to inspire us and honestly i have i have a lot to thank her i don't really know forget i forget her name but i will find out at some point i have a lot to thank for her for what she has done to me because she inspired me very very much she inspired me so much actually because literally i kept taking the exact same class over and over and over again because that was the only class that was available you know for the high school and so i kept asking him like listen can i we take it again and again and again again every single semester and of course should allow me and it came to a point where i couldn't even register for the normal class so i end up basically just registering through like kind of like actually coming to her she had to sign a waiver and then i had to go back to the principal's office and then that's the only way they could put me in but at that point it was too late because all the seats were taken right and so what i end up having to do which is really funny is i end up having to actually have to learn in a closet there was a small closet by the class and that's where i learned because more all the seats were taken you know because from the students i could actually register but that doesn't stop me i was hungry like i want to learn i found a lot of interest in this and literally what happened is you know i bought my own laptop actually my parents bought my laptop was my first laptop that they bought me school is a sony some sony something i'm not remember for sure but i bought my laptop and that's left i brought in every single day and i went to the closet and i literally just worked there and i didn't work on the projects that were usual projects for the class but i actually was the assistant of the teacher at this point i was actually just building projects from scratch at this point right and and it kind of got started from there honestly it was it was really really cool and uh i started to fall in love with the art of creation something of creating a of creating an application right and one time my senior year my last year of high school i decided you know let's go out there with a bang let's do this you know and so here's what i did i didn't tell the teacher but i ended up actually building rebuilding the whole high school's website from scratch with a new design without even telling her yeah i'll build this in about maybe i'll say about a month it took me and i brought it to her i'm like listen teacher is look look at check this out imagine this is a laptop like look check this out here's here's the website and she was like holy [ __ ] right she was surprised because i didn't tell her about it but she loved it she loved what i did and guess what this website came out to be this went live i ended up working with another student to make it fully functional make it mobile friendly and everything and this website was live for the high the whole high school literally for three years straight i'm not kidding for three years straight this was the the website that was live at on the high school the high school was called warren my high school and i have everything to thank that teacher the web design class the reason to where i am today now that was the start right that was the start of how things got started because of that design class i realized that's what i wanted to do that's what i love to do and so i was like you know what that's where i'm going to get my college degree from i worked really hard i got good grades you know and you know and i got scholarships and so i went to a university you know i went to university of michigan dearborn and it was it was a pretty good university and but the thing i realized however is that literally about you know a quarter in or you know my first semester in i realized that i wasn't gonna get what i wanted like real real world experience i wasn't gonna get that from in university unfortunately so the first literally the first the first semester i started searching for like okay what are some of the opportunities out there like what can i do what can i find at opportunities other experiences i started building my own websites i started building my own little blogs i was i built this my own blog called techhelp.org it's not existing anymore don't worry don't don't even go on there but right but this is my own blog and and it was crazy like you know and i was building like page by page using dreamweaver not even using like some crazy php it was literally just using dreamweaver and it wasn't even you using a database it wasn't until later on that i realized what a database is i can actually use a database you know to to populate data um but i'll kind of get started from there and then one time i went to creative computing club and this creative club was very interesting and i met uh these friends they're called robert and steve and i met them i saw them do something really cool they're doing like an application it was a application at the time called trendala and this application the whole point was like to bring all these different like you know uh websites now like for example pandora amazon you know zara you know zappos all these clothing stores to bring them together into one application right called trindala you swipe left to dislike swipe right to like it's as simple as that you can actually search up on google you will see what it means it doesn't exist anymore don't worry about it but and it was really cool i was like holy [ __ ] guys can i help you out somehow and again i knew barely nothing that was like listen i was willing to work for free and they're like okay i mean sure if you want to help i'll help out sure sure and so what they end up doing is they end up giving me like a small little project to do which is to build a python scraper and you know based on how i built it they would actually you know you know then i'll work with them and and then they tell me to build a python script and then the first thing i did when i went home was i'm literally like you know what is python like what is python that's literally what what i typed into google and then i'm like okay build a scraper in python that's the second thing i typed into google right so and i realized more and more as i learned i realize you can build you know a scraper you know with beautiful soup and stuff like that and so that's what i did and so i literally stayed up blue for two nights straight nonstop no sleep whatsoever i stayed there for two nights straight building a python scraper using beautiful soup and you know what i did it i built it i sent it back to them they later get a response they're like bro let's go let's do it and and so yeah i end up kind of joining this little there's a group of people it's a stephen robert they they're one of my they're amazing friends i still have i still talk with it talk to them and and the thing is the cool part is is and so i continued to work with them and they were my mentors they were the reason kind of like that gave me that jump start and honestly i am so thankful for them and for what they have done for me um robert one of the guys he is a very technical guy and he was building scrapers because one of one of the things that we had to do was we had to build a lot of scrapers like you know amazon scraper zappos scraper you know scrapers that will scrape a bunch of websites then take data and then that's what you would use and he would mentor me like he would always be there to you know when i asked had to ask questions and so forth and would literally within two to three weeks like like i would you know i'll go from not do knowing anything to actually building my own scraper python scraper with scrapey and jingle and we had a whole database in my sql database in the back end we had our own server it was insane and and i learned so much like literally within a month i i just like my growth just skyrocketed and it was all because of them because of robert because of steve steve he taught me more on the business side of things right so he taught me more the project management he's because he's a great product manager right and i learned how to lead team and and so forth and we got to a point where we had this application running is a trendable application it was so cool and everything and you know we and then we tried to market it and you know as developers who we are we're not the best marketers unfortunately so i know some some are i'm not saying everybody but some are just not the best marketers we were not the best market as well should have to say and so we like we went to this uh electric forest thing where and we painted like 200 shirts like we bought 200 shirts to market our application and it was called what was it called electric fashion called forest fashion like hashtag forest fashion you know then tag us for i said first fashion for and so forth and like thinking back i'm like what the hell we're thinking you know but but i literally have this picture of us literally outside the office we worked and we had 200 shirts that we bought white shirts and we were literally we stenciled out you know this picture says trandala and forest fashion and we would just paint it 200 shirts the whole day nonstop like like i don't know what were we thinking i don't know honestly but but we did it and and so you know we did 200 shirts and then we went to wendell chuck forest and we got responses one response we got one person tagging us on instagram with the hashtag forest fashion and then tagged us on instagram with the trend attack i don't know i don't know anything like i said uh you know like it's okay but it was fun indeed you know then i end up basically what i'm doing is like we continue doing that then we actually actually we kind of switched to a different product then we end up working with someone else like actually just like a contract to help them out and the whole time also then we i worked as a mentor for another group of people like it was a capstone project people back in my old university so at this point i was basically you know only my sophomore year but i was already teaching people who were finished up college which was insane so i was leading a group of people quicking up college and that kind of gave me a lot of knowledge on leadership so that's the one point i want to bring up to you guys is you know for anybody here who's kind of hearing my story and you guys are like maybe you're struggling like how do i get started well one way to get started is i want you to keep in mind that you know working for free is not bad working for free is something you should not be scared of you know yes i work for free i work for free for them for a whole year and a half like i was just passionate but i'll be honest with you that year and a half was probably some of the funnest times i had in my life i'll be fully honest with you i didn't get paid nor do i want to i was very lucky to be living with my parents so i i didn't have to pay for things like you know like housing so i was very lucky on that side but i just remember going you know going to university going to university and then again driving right back to the office and then just continue to work i had this passion we all had this drive this path to just work and work and work and we loved it they loved it we all loved we got together we thought about how to make an erd diet and we thought about all these different things and we even go to professors to get like to get help and and it was awesome it was so much fun every single day was a ride it was like a roller coaster and i i had so much fun and we built so much amazing like we built so much trust together we built this amazing you know um i don't know this amazing environment together thriving environment each person just cared about each other and each person just pushed it to do better and better and better and i just i still have the state like i thank them so much for where i am because my skills you know were developed then a lot of muscular developed then um but then of course at that point you know after about a year and a half we almost done you know i decided to do something else then they decided something else and then we kind of moved on from though from that point on i now the cool part is though is because i already had the experience um i knew at this point how to approach companies and i had some good experience behind my back i had the proper mentors and so i now know how to get into the world of you know actually being paid at this point right and i started i started to apply for jobs i literally literally year and a half i think at this point i was you know junior year junior in college and i started to apply for these jobs apply for google facebook twitter and so forth and i started doing all these interviews and and i got a lot of interviews actually you know i got interviews with google they actually flew me down to california which is really amazing they filmed down all the way to california they the cool part they paid for the whole trip so it's like a free trip biscuit you get which is awesome so but the coolest part was like you know i was actually passing interviews and uh they flew me down and then i got a chance to like you know actually be an interview with them and i got to speak with a googler while on the interview now i will say the interviews are not easy they're hard so good they're really hard actually they're to a point of like i had to like learn algorithms and i know hackerrank lead code and all these other ones nonstop um but you know i just and i did and i did and and i had an interview with with twitter uh that was a lot of fun too um appellantier that was really good they actually flew me down as well so i got two trips for free um but that's not the goal again free is not the goal here the goal is to get a job right unfortunately i did not get placed into those roles uh i still got the chance to interview and i was really really close to being placed um and i even had of you with khan academy that was a lot of fun too with squarespace for khan academy i end up having to create like this graphql type structure which is really cool for squarespace i created this amazing um they asked they they had me create this what's it called what was it the name of it it was a machine learning algorithm that would predict you know the winner and the winner of like uh predict the winner of of a sender or something in the in the state i don't know i don't remember the winner of something based on data and i that's when i i actually had to learn machine learning like when they give the game that thing so that was a lot of fun too um but the point is you know i've gone through a lot of different experiences i was never afraid to try different things i was never afraid to challenge myself i was never afraid to just go out there just do and go and go and go and i have a lot of things to thank my parents because they gave me that space to do you know what i mean like i wasn't pushed to hey nas you have to you know go and work right now hey nas have to do this i was given space to do that and i was patient i was very patient and so that's what i want you to remember as well is you know number one like i said you know don't be afraid to run for free number two is very important be patient right developing sorry developing is a hard job right get into coding is a hard thing it takes time it takes patience but the cool thing is the reward is insane their words aren't the best are worse because now i get to get to code i get to be creative every day i get to have fun to me work is play right and on top of that you get to make money and on top of that now personally for me i get to teach and that to me is everything my mom was a teacher and i'm a teacher who knew i told my mom i'm not gonna be a teacher but guess what no i guess i am a teacher so i guess it runs the family but besides that right again did all these interviews and then finally i came back to came back to um uh michigan and and i finally called up one of my friends on my friends uh and and i'm like hey bro do you know any company that are hiring and he actually recom he was like hey actually now my company is hiring and the company is called urban science and he actually gave my resume to the company and he actually referred me now that's another thing is referrals are key in this industry he referred me and guess what i wanted for any of you within one day i got the job got the jobs as an intern as an intern and honestly that was cool that's the one thing to understand this is why i make such a big difference is build and network around yourself right that's part three is build a network around yourself because you know a lot of these companies they work based on referrals even google they like referrals you know when somebody refers to that puts you way higher on the list of you know for you to be hired same thing for facebook and the other company so build network build referrals build people around yourself right that's the first that's that's kind of one thing i will tell you but anyways i got the job and i was with this company and honestly i was liking it i was building things out i was building things with microsoft i wasn't doing like things with like angular or ajs which which is what i wanted to do but in either case they gave me this project which is to put together data from all these different data sources right and it was like millions lines of code millions lines of like database rows i had to put together data from and i did i the i had about two months to do it i did it within about a month so i actually made it shorter and so the rest of the time i was like okay well what am i going to do now and i actually decided to do something really cool i decided to learn machine learning while on the job how i asked of course i've asked a manager if i can do that um and so he loved it like he loved my enthusiasm for work and how much how much i worked and he's like yeah sure of course just just go do it and and i did and so i learned and so i went i took my first course it was from udacity it was a free machine learning class from udacity i took that course and i started learning about linear regression and you know naive bayes algorithms and stuff like that and and i and i started to apply it and i was like holy [ __ ] i built my first algorithm to machine learning to predict something and why not apply that now to this and uh so i did and then so basically on my free time i just basically end up just working on this machine learning algorithm and and it predicted can you not believe this i predicted the amount of leads that they are going to have within the next few months right there that was me no actually i know not i'm a wait i'm a really slow typer my tech is more like that's that's my type of speed but and anyways right so that's kind of what happened it was it was really really cool and and and when it came down to presentations because we it was an internship so when all these interns were presenting i had something different at the table i i presented like okay so here's what i did i did this this this but hold on i also did this and when i presented my machine learning algorithm when i presented you know how i trained 80 percent i used 80 of that data to train the rest 20 data to see my prediction results that are correct or not they were like holy [ __ ] this guy went above and beyond and guess what because of that i end up being asked later on to work with it to work with their machine learning team yeah so i ended up actually having an interview with machine learning team and they created a role for me specific because they didn't have a role open they created a role for me specifically so i can work with them how cool is that yeah so i'm doing that i ended up just kind of working with them and i joined the machine learning team and that was fun i was working with people who were like senior developers you know had master's degrees they were building machine learning algorithms to predict like to see if your signature is corr is like fraudulent or not they were building some epic stuff and i was having so much fun um yeah and i loved it i also loved it and then and then they offered me a job before i even finished college i had a job offer for sixty thousand dollars without even without any degree no degree whatsoever um but didn't stop there so before i get going that's the one thing i want to uh that's the i think part four i want to tell you is you know if you want to get into development and you want to put yourself out there take initiative take a niche to do things outside the box don't just do just what you're being asked to don't just do the standard thing okay go outside be creative do things that are gonna be really cool with you right have fun take initiative that is what differentiates someone who is going to go very far was gonna which is something who's going to go very linear okay so that's my little tip for you take [ __ ] challenges take action then things will be easier now so what happened next well basically i got a job offer but then before i was supposed to start i was supposed to start basically in no july before july my friend case you know approached me and said hey bro i got this cool company you know called service.com and you know and you know they're building this cool application and they're looking for developers and so he wanted me to go ahead and you know maybe potentially you know uh go for an interview and i did and i went from like okay sure why not what's the worst i already have a job why not go for another interview that's fine um and it went from the interview and i don't know i just love the startup environment i love the startup game i loved creating things from scratch with an idea i loved having a lot of impact right that to me was very interesting much more than just you know working at a company again nothing against that that's just to me is what i loved right and so i did that i ended up basically going for an interview they gave me another project to do i did the project and what happened is uh within about a week i got the job but this time they offered me seventy thousand dollars so not 60k so they went to 70k now at this point you know what i'll take it okay i like it 10k more plus about the job of course so yeah i had them telling the other company unfortunate that i was not able to continue with them and so i ended up going with this company and honestly it was a lot of fun it was so much fun and and i ended up just kind of you know working with them and so forth and we started working this this idea we started to really uh build this application called service.com and we've got this dashboard using angularjs front end and i was using jingle as well because i knew django so i was a full stack developer there and to me it was so much fun like we stay up late nights to work on stuff like this and we will fix problems and stuff i just know i love that hustle of like you know working in a startup company to me like this this whole thing of wearing a lot of hats it's always a lot of fun um and and and i remember those days and it was you know like i just i had an amazing team i was very thankful for them um and literally for about a year and a half i was working with them and uh really trying really hard but the year and a half i grew as so much i grew as a leader of leading a team i became really good at you know project management i became really good at you know talking to business and talking to the developers you know using diagrams and stuff like this and i just i realized i'm really good explaining things you know in the meantime however i was also putting my instagram yeah i was putting my instagram and and just because i wanted to share i want to share my knowledge i want to share you know what i was doing and i started with a lot of people you know connected with a lot of people in the business on instagram and and they connected with quasi actually yeah that somehow somehow happened um and so that's another thing that comes to you is like don't be afraid to put yourself out there right one of the biggest things that people will see is there are a lot of amazing people out there so put yourself out there linkedin instagram face whatever it might be you know just create a connection create network there are a lot of amazing people out there i know i know social media might not be the best thing sometimes but trust me if it's good for the right reasons it's a good thing to use exactly so end up doing that basically and um a year and a half into it i realized that i wanted to do something different i realized i'm like you know what i'm not happy with this job anymore unfortunately i wanted to i was stagnating i i was going up so many different times at this point i was like you know what i it doesn't feel right now at this point and and so i decided to quit decided to quit went to my boss and uh went to the manager went to the boss and i was like listen um sorry i'm giving you to my two weeks notice and so forth and and here's what he had to say i laugh at this to this day so listen up really quickly he looks at me now he's like listen son sit down and i sat down and he said to me he's like listen i'm going to tell you this as a father as as an employer as a financial advisor and as a friend you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] not your [ __ ] nuts your [ __ ] nuts wait this out if you have to kyle so and i was like wait what so that was really funny um he's like yeah why would you leave we're like we're about to close this deal it's gonna go great you're leaving a time when things are good and i was like yeah but i'm just not happy i want to try something different i'm i'm a gogetter i'm someone when i have an idea in my mind i want to go for i will go for it no matter what because i knew i know the opportunity lies ahead if i try if i don't try then i i might regret it later on to me the question i ask myself is always why is the alternative like what's the alternative to me you know try something new well the alternative is to keep doing the exact same thing i was doing before to make the same amount of money to continue stagnating and so forth and i was like that's not an alternative i'm happy with i don't want to do that and so i quit i was like listen sorry that's my decision and i did it and he's still trying to take me back and so forth and i really appreciate that but you know i end up actually not doing it and i ended up because i was wanting into freelancing now i got to freelance but here's the coolest part the coolest part is that because i was very valuable to the team right when i started freelancing the day i quit the job and i had signed my signature saying that i'm out that's it that's it they gave me a contract where they became my first client so right away after basically quitting i right away had my first job my first client and it was them so that was really cool and this gave me the chance to work remotely you know outside them and so that's what i did and i was working really hard i worked remote and stuff like that and and so on i got more clients and i got more clients and and and i'll be honest you freelancing is not easy i'll be honest with you you're right from the getgo guys freelancing is not an easy thing you feel if you think that you're going to be a millionaire as a freelancer within your next year ah hell no and that's exactly what you're doing unless you're in a really good business but it was hard like i had to learn client management i had to learn how to hire people had to learn how to sell i had to learn how to go to conferences it was probably one of the toughest years so far you know i went from working like literally you know 40 hours a week to working you know 70 hours a week 80 hours a week and i was tiring and so but i was growing like the coolest part to me is i was happy because i was growing i was doing something that i was in control of and and then something happened i went to a conference well actually before that i actually met qazi and and you know we got to do a live call cause i was doing live call on instagram at that point those times and i got the live call with him he interviewed me and i got the chance to just be interviewed and to speak about my whole experience you know as a developer and i was like holy [ __ ] this is a cool game yeah they reached out to me i don't remember we just started messaging together but they're like amazing gangs i'm like holy [ __ ] and i actually might do my first video with them my first video that i did for them was a video on like i think my building my my todo list in rappel that it using django i think i think that was the name of it or something something like that i forgot but i made that video and i and i sent it to them and and that's where they actually it's actually live on cleverprogrammer i think you probably find it it's todo list with django i think that's that's what it's called and that's my first video with them that's my first video in general like period you know but i had a lot of fun it was different than anything else and so what happened is very simple at that point what happened is that um after that i i kind of went to a conference in las vegas it was called popcon and it's usually where i get my clients usually when i find a client and so forth and that's you when i learn things um and from the conference i was supposed to go back to michigan but i assigned not to i decided to cancel my ticket i decided to get a new ticket to go to california to meet these guys to me qazi in the whole gang and the whole crew and i literally remember this day i'm like i arrived at the airport you know again this is out of spite out of nowhere i arrived at the airport i'm like hey kilgookasi um you know i'm in california can i stay here please and and he's like yeah sure and and so i ended up doing it i stayed his place we met you know i met you know frankie then aaron and kazi of course and holy [ __ ] no i think i was supposed to stay for one week in california i ended up staying for a whole month got my my own airbnb i know and there was just something where i just loved being around this team i loved thinking about content and teaching people and you know and so forth and i was working at the same time as a freelancer at the same time you know but i was also helping them out just just just just just because it was fun and then something happened we're like okay so we did a lot of stuff it's a lot of fun i love the crew team of people you know but we weren't working there officially together at that point on and then i came back to michigan i came back to michigan i get a call from kazi and qazi says bro let's build a javascript course and i'm like bro let's do it literally within split seconds i just agreed to it you know again i'm just the kind of a person that that just goes for what he wants that takes big especially at this age i'm 25 right now uh this is the best stage to take risks it's the best day is to try different things because i feel my parents always told me you know you know you don't want to be you know later on you know in your eye in your life thinking that oh i wish i would have done this i wish i tried this especially when you have kids later on and so forth and and you're busy you may not have the chance to try this you still can but you mind that you this was easier right now and i was like yeah let's do it so we started doing and started doing other stuff we launched our course called profit with javascript okay and and then that came around and that was successful and so forth and then and then covet hit and then and i was like and i and i know i love working at this point i love working with the team i loved working on this course and building modules and stuff like this and and and i started like this more than my freelancing gigs and then so kyle was like bro what can we do to put you good do your children full time and so i did i went full time and it was actually during covet when before ko and kova to hit i think i think so i think so and so we went full time and that's when like a lot of things changed we started doing challenges that was a lot of fun we started doing you know uh building up the course builders amazing community right you know doing coaching calls stuff like that and it was so much fun and i loved and i've realized how just how much i loved teaching and i realized just how much i was growing as a person like a lot it was challenging correct but i [ __ ] loved it you know so and yeah and so that's kind of the story how can i went through and now circle back to this now we've done a lot more than than you know than that we built a boot camp and some different other things and now we're teaching i get to teach thousands of people every single day and i am excited for the future i'm excited for the future where we get to teach hundreds of people get to help so many developers become developers so people become developers and and i just i can't wait for where we'll go next but there's to come back full circle now you know from somebody who came from ukraine they know any english with parents who had only five hundred dollars in the in the in in you know in hand you know someone who you know gets to teach thousands of people around the world coding and i get to help my parents out now with money yeah to me that's cool that's pretty cool i'm pretty happy about that and i can't wait for where it takes us next so let's get a little bit emotional there because i just know because it takes a lot of hard work to you know it takes a lot of hard work sometimes you don't realize just how much work it takes to know to where you are right now unless you talk about it this is really really good um to actually talk about this because those days were hard so you know maybe hopefully you get something to go take something away from this maybe a lesson or two maybe you inspire you to maybe do coding because the opportunity is there it's there all you have to do is take the chance take the leap all you have to do is just try it all you have to do is just put in time and effort right i want you to be open be openminded you know if you're closedminded that's just not that's not gonna get you to where you want but if you're an openminded person you know you try different things you you put yourself out there you connect with people you you know you're not afraid to take action amazing things happen amazing things happen so so on and on there i don't know what did you learn from this you know what did you learn from this and what did you learn from this video let me know in the comments below i'm going to read all of them okay i'm very curious did you learn the fact that you want to become developer did you know the fact that you need some patience did you learn the fact that you know uh you know you're you need to actually take action to maybe invest in yourself or maybe you need to maybe try it out actually put more time into it what'd you learn i want to know and i'll respond to you okay let me know in the comments below what you are going to do now and what now excites you and if this is a story that relates to you let me know as well okay and that's it so look at this point thank you so much for listening i hope you have an amazing day and i'll see you in the next video adios
