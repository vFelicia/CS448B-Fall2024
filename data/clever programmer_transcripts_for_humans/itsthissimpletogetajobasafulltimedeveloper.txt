00:29 - in the Marines I was just a networking
00:31 - computer stuff like that yeah and I
00:33 - enjoyed it but I was injured in
00:35 - motorcycle accidents and I use a
00:36 - wheelchair wheelchair user yep and in
00:39 - the Marines they gave me a GI Bill and I
00:42 - went to college to further my computer
00:44 - networking career and the college I
00:47 - picked didn't have a networking hat I
00:50 - said well we have development or
00:52 - business like I guess the new
00:55 - development but Devon was just wait year
00:58 - yeah and they said well we have
01:01 - development over there that's perfect
01:02 - yes so I picked it up and I live there
01:06 - that's beautiful and are you like were
01:08 - you working for our company with good
01:10 - development and what language were using
01:13 - started out working for passport health
01:15 - and we use C sharp and BB BB a or
01:25 - whatever yeah but old there's a better
01:28 - use anymore then my new company we use
01:31 - just C sharp or just C sharp a B C sharp
01:32 - in DC shop and I thought we did okay
01:35 - visual studio and that's currently what
01:37 - you're doing yeah okay awesome
01:39 - but now yeah an hour for nationals
01:41 - Nashville Tennessee metro government
01:43 - yeah so if somebody wants to break into
01:46 - the industry you know like as of today
01:48 - and they want to get a job as a
01:50 - full-time developer yeah like how long
01:53 - should they should it take like what's
01:56 - the best path for that basically should
01:58 - they get a degree how long should they
01:59 - wait before they apply hi I went to
02:02 - college I got a bachelor degree and went
02:05 - from there it's a lot easier to prove
02:06 - yourself if you have a bachelor's degree
02:08 - so look I have a degree and then most
02:10 - companies that are hiring entry-level
02:11 - they respect the decree they you got it
02:15 - agreed you know what she's talking about
02:16 - but I do know that if you can specialize
02:19 - yourself in one particular thing like
02:21 - you can specialize yourself in like five
02:23 - phone applications yep you can fruit
02:25 - write some applications prove yourself
02:27 - in that field that's all you need you
02:29 - don't need all the other stuff if you
02:31 - can get to the part where you can write
02:33 - useful application to just that and you
02:35 - can prove yourself there that's all you
02:36 - need to do so it can't depends on you on
02:38 - your focus if you're wanting to write
02:39 - after pipeline applications or
02:41 - that's all you do be able to prove
02:43 - yourself in that field or this field or
02:45 - if you don't have a specific then get a
02:47 - degree and status you're as you're okay
02:51 - and so instead of like people kind of
02:53 - doing something just super general which
02:55 - is what people end up doing a lot of the
02:57 - times they hope that piece of paper is
02:59 - going to get them a degree but you say
03:01 - hey get actually something very specific
03:04 - if you're gonna get a degree make it
03:05 - very specific you know because what I
03:07 - yeah it's different for every person
03:10 - some people want to do open applications
03:12 - that's what they want to do they don't
03:13 - want to do Android they don't want to do
03:15 - web development they don't want to do
03:19 - background they just want to do iPhone
03:21 - application so they get very specific in
03:23 - that and they have to find a way to
03:25 - prove themselves that they're that
03:26 - they're efficient in that field yeah and
03:30 - then show that to an employer
03:32 - and look I can bring this to you and go
03:34 - from there or you know start up their
03:36 - own shop and somehow get their own
03:38 - customers okay cool and are you planning
03:41 - to start up something like freelancing
03:44 - or you've always been just interesting I
03:46 - like working for somebody who can tell
03:48 - me what to do I can have a developer I'm
03:50 - not a designer got a problem so I don't
03:52 - have the vision of what they want so
03:55 - working with her and her YouTube channel
03:56 - she's great because she could tell me
03:58 - what she wants and I can do that
04:00 - she wants it to look like this I want it
04:02 - to do that you wanna click this button
04:03 - and go there I can make it yes tell me
04:06 - what you want and I can do it so I like
04:08 - working in the back end I don't like I
04:10 - don't like the stress of the constant
04:12 - fight or finding the next client and
04:14 - getting this product out the next day
04:16 - and that stuff I just like to make stuff
04:18 - happen they could make an actual make
04:20 - work have easier for people
04:23 - without without being the go to die and
04:26 - everything is not from my fault and and
04:28 - you know when they don't know how to use
04:30 - their system or something then being
04:34 - that guy yeah it just adds a lot of
04:36 - additional pressure yeah I guess in that
04:38 - case okay so this is pretty awesome so
04:40 - guys if you want to be if you want to do
04:42 - full-time one of the things that Wes
04:45 - says is try to actually apply and do
04:47 - something very specific get a niche that
04:50 - will help you actually get a job faster
04:52 - whether it's like you know going for
04:54 - iPhone applications or desktop
04:56 - applications with Python or data
04:58 - analysis or finances but something
05:00 - specific it's probably a little bit
