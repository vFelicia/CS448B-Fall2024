With timestamps:

00:00 - will AI replace programmers not only
00:02 - coder jobs but every industry jobs are
00:05 - at risk as a developer I am having job
00:07 - security thoughts after seeing chat GPT
00:09 - do all this stuff it means no future for
00:11 - software Engineers with more and more
00:13 - stable AI
00:18 - short answer no long answer maybe look
00:22 - when calculators came out mathematicians
00:25 - weren't like let's all drive down to the
00:26 - Golden Gate Bridge and just take a
00:28 - nosedive when tools like tractors came
00:30 - out Farmers didn't stop existing when
00:33 - social media came out people didn't stop
00:35 - communicating to each other now here's
00:37 - what did happen a ton of behavior
00:39 - changed there were a lot less Farmers
00:41 - than there were before because one
00:42 - farmer could do the job now of multiple
00:44 - retractors with social media instead of
00:47 - going out and speaking to people he
00:49 - could speak to thousands of people just
00:50 - like I am right now with a video and
00:52 - with mathematics people are able to
00:54 - think at a higher level because they
00:56 - have calculators for programming you
00:58 - have greater languages than assembly and
01:00 - so all that's happening is we're able to
01:02 - operate at a higher and higher and
01:04 - higher level and progressively will keep
01:06 - operating at a higher level until our
01:08 - speed from input to Output becomes
01:10 - almost instant that is essentially where
01:12 - we are approaching where we as human
01:14 - beings using the aid of Technology are
01:16 - trying to become
01:18 - for the lack of a better word gods
01:22 - where when we think of an idea it
01:25 - becomes that's where we're approaching
01:27 - even Elon Musk said this on a Joe Rogan
01:29 - podcast where he said our input ability
01:31 - currently input output ability is very
01:34 - slow we take in information and we
01:35 - output it very slowly so if we need to
01:37 - send a message her brain thinks about
01:39 - that then we go on our phone then we
01:41 - type it in then the message gets sent
01:42 - out he wants to reduce that to almonds
01:44 - instant where things like neural link
01:46 - could think it and things could become
01:50 - so really all it comes down to is your
01:53 - ability to critically think and solve
01:54 - useful problems all of the tools are
01:56 - designed to help you so as AI is coming
01:58 - will a lot of programmers be losing
02:01 - their jobs absolutely
02:04 - will there still be a need for
02:06 - programmers yes because you will still
02:08 - need programmers who can use tools like
02:10 - chat GPT to Output with 5 10 15
02:14 - developers could now it the choice is in
02:17 - your hands you could be on the side of I
02:20 - am defeated this technology is coming I
02:22 - am stressed I can't sleep at night I
02:25 - should just end my career right here
02:27 - right now and if you do so the other
02:29 - developers will probably thank you
02:31 - thank you if you decide not to do so and
02:34 - if you decide to continue I promise you
02:37 - will be one of the developers that will
02:39 - out leverage and outwork a lot of other
02:41 - developers not by more work ethic
02:43 - because you have a tool like Chad gbt or
02:45 - other AI tools that will come along to
02:47 - help you you'll output 5 10 developers
02:49 - work
02:53 - we as an economy and Country and the
02:56 - world will just move at a much faster
02:58 - Pace when we want to think of an app and
03:00 - we want to build an app we'll be able to
03:01 - build that app almost as fast as we can
03:03 - think of it and so the thing the app
03:05 - that took a year before might take three
03:07 - to five months now because you have
03:08 - tools like chat GPT to be able to help
03:10 - you write your code if you need to come
03:12 - up with functions hey the function that
03:13 - sums things up it can just write it for
03:15 - you hey can you add this feature to the
03:17 - app Chad GPT can write it for you hey we
03:19 - need to be able to handle users or save
03:21 - these users to a Firebase type that in
03:24 - Chad GPT or an AI technology will start
03:27 - spitting out code for you and you could
03:28 - plug it in can you wake me up my backend
03:30 - that can handle post requests or get
03:32 - requests for our users or allow our
03:34 - users to update their app or their
03:36 - profile picture or their user profile or
03:39 - whatever it may be boom Chad GPT can
03:41 - spit out code you could plug it in and
03:43 - now your app has a new feature so really
03:45 - your ability to produce increases at a
03:49 - really high rate so if you want to be
03:51 - the modern day developer I would say
03:52 - Chad GPT or AI has to be your tool set
03:56 - has to be part of your tool set you need
03:58 - to learn programming you should still
04:00 - continue learning programming but on top
04:02 - of that you should add the use of AI to
04:06 - help you in your Learning Journey to
04:08 - help you output more code to be more
04:11 - efficient to build more to ship more
04:13 - projects I think the Modern Day
04:15 - Developers as human beings right we're
04:16 - becoming more and more like cyborgs
04:18 - again something that Elon Musk says
04:20 - which is we didn't have anything right
04:21 - then we got computers and then we got
04:23 - phones and we were able to access any
04:25 - piece of information from our phone well
04:27 - now we have this assistant that works
04:29 - with us our Jarvis chat GPT or any AI
04:32 - tool they'll be coming along it allows
04:34 - it works with you and it helps you think
04:36 - of it like a butler that works alongside
04:38 - you the people that will be winning
04:40 - tomorrow are the people who are adapting
04:42 - to technology any person who's won look
04:45 - at history are the people that adapted
04:47 - to technology so the farmers that
04:48 - started learning how to use tractors the
04:50 - mathematicians started using and teach
04:52 - teaching how to use calculators as fast
04:54 - as possible
04:57 - everybody who failed were people who
05:00 - were afraid of change scared pissed
05:02 - themselves when new technology came out
05:04 - coward and fear made themselves useless
05:06 - and just went well nothing matters
05:09 - anymore yes at the end of the day
05:10 - nothing matters you're gonna die and
05:12 - none of this is gonna exist the sun is
05:14 - gonna explode and they're gonna be no
05:15 - energy left there might even be a big
05:17 - bang that happens later so in an
05:18 - infinite amount of time span yes nothing
05:21 - will matter but practically speaking
05:22 - right so you know the reason I'm saying
05:24 - that is because a lot of you are like
05:25 - well yeah it's coming and it's only a
05:28 - matter of time until they could do
05:29 - everything
05:30 - okay but until then you can do a lot of
05:32 - things and you need to be focused on the
05:34 - present because what you're talking
05:36 - about might not happen within 50 to 100
05:37 - years and by that time you'll be dead so
05:39 - what do you have to worry about
05:42 - so for now all you can do what you
05:44 - should do is adapt to these Technologies
05:46 - learn how to use them learn all these
05:48 - tools use them on a daily basis to build
05:50 - applications to write code constantly
05:54 - and consistently use it I promise you
05:55 - the best of the developers we're going
05:57 - to be seeing now are going to be the
05:59 - ones that could use these tools these AI
06:01 - tools are adapted to this technology and
06:04 - you will be some of the most highest
06:05 - paid most educated highest value people
06:08 - on the planet so short answer
06:12 - no AI will not replace the need for
06:15 - programmers long answer the reason why I
06:18 - said maybe is because in a long enough
06:20 - time Horizon where AI can do everything
06:23 - including think
06:25 - that's a possibility but we're not even
06:27 - close to it so you need to adapt to this
06:29 - technology take this technology use it
06:32 - on an everyday basis use this technology
06:34 - to build apps go conquer the freaking
06:36 - planet
06:37 - [Music]
