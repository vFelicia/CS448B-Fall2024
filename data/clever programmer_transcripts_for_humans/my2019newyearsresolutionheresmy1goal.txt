00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:03 - is papa Python from clever programmer
00:06 - calm I also go by Kazi so you can call
00:09 - me whichever one you want
00:10 - today marks day 2 of the video challenge
00:14 - I'm doing which is gonna be a 30 day
00:16 - video challenge now if you want to use
00:18 - this time to go along with me and do a
00:21 - writing challenge or a coding challenge
00:24 - every morning or every day then you
00:27 - should do so with that said today I want
00:30 - to talk about this really cool concept I
00:33 - had this epiphany a few days ago and I'm
00:36 - not epiphany but something that kind of
00:38 - stuck in my mind and maybe you'll like
00:41 - it so I want to just share it with you
00:43 - so there's this thing called failure
00:46 - that we might be familiar with in our
00:49 - life all right now what is failure let's
00:54 - talk about failure failure often times
00:57 - means that you wanted to do something
00:59 - but it didn't happen you want it to set
01:03 - yourself up to start a business and make
01:06 - it successful but it didn't happen and
01:08 - it didn't become successful so you go
01:11 - ahead and you call that business a
01:13 - failure right so maybe like your
01:16 - business was a bust
01:18 - so I don't have a red marker but I'm
01:21 - just gonna use a purple marker and just
01:23 - say like the business idea failed and
01:25 - then we can have more types of failures
01:28 - so we can have a business failing we can
01:30 - have
01:31 - oh we failed to become a developer or
01:34 - failed to learn to code so it's like
01:38 - coding code you know that's right here
01:42 - Python I'm a failure so I can keep going
01:45 - down the list but we have this idea of
01:47 - failure and failure is actually a really
01:50 - really bad thing but here's what I want
01:52 - you to think about to think about
01:53 - anything in your life that you have
01:55 - gotten good at anything that you have
01:58 - gotten good at so it could be music it
02:01 - could be your ability to pen tap it
02:05 - could be your ability to juggle or play
02:07 - soccer or basketball or
02:11 - Vall whatever it may be for video games
02:14 - something that you got good at let me
02:16 - ask you a question how many times you so
02:23 - that's my question to you is how many
02:26 - times did you actually fail in the thing
02:30 - that you got good at so I'm willing to
02:32 - say that if you were to look at anything
02:35 - you got good at anything you consider
02:38 - yourself to be improved at or good at
02:40 - and then I want you to compare it to
02:42 - something you suck at something you're
02:44 - not very good at so for example I'm not
02:47 - very good at basketball I'm really bad
02:49 - at basketball okay so I'm gonna write
02:51 - down basketball here I'm really bad at
02:54 - basketball but I am a lot better at
03:00 - table tennis what is the difference
03:05 - between basketball and table tennis well
03:08 - why am i a much better at table tennis
03:10 - and then I'm really bad at basketball
03:12 - the only thing that's in between these
03:15 - two that differentiates them is that I
03:18 - have actually failed a lot more times in
03:22 - table tennis than I have in basketball
03:26 - I haven't taken enough shots to fail in
03:29 - a lot of shots or miss a lot of shots
03:31 - but in table tennis I have taken lots
03:33 - and lots and lots of L's and lots and
03:36 - lots of failures what is going on here
03:39 - well the point is this anything that you
03:41 - are actually good at
03:43 - you have failed at it more times than
03:45 - the thing that you suck at so what does
03:49 - that actually mean what that actually
03:50 - means is that this thing that we hate
03:53 - and despise and a lot of people have
03:56 - this thing called fear of failure which
03:58 - you know most people do we hate this
04:00 - thing it's a bad thing right it's a bad
04:03 - thing we don't like it I don't can't
04:05 - make a thumbs-down sign so I'm gonna
04:07 - make a arrow down
04:08 - we hate this thing it's a terrible thing
04:10 - it's a bad thing it's kind of like a
04:11 - disease for us except the more of this
04:15 - we have the more of success we have in
04:18 - the other things that we do in life all
04:20 - right if you fail a lot in coding like a
04:22 - lot of people watch my coding and
04:24 - they're like
04:25 - oh my god kasi you know you're so you're
04:27 - so good at you're so good at this or to
04:29 - look at somebody else's coding and they
04:31 - were like I can never be the software
04:33 - developer or that good really all that
04:35 - person did is fail a lot more times than
04:37 - you did right I failed a lot more times
04:39 - maybe the you know if depending on what
04:42 - your skill set is in coding but I
04:44 - probably feel a lot more times than you
04:45 - and that's why I am a little bit better
04:49 - at coding but you might have failed a
04:51 - lot more time that's something else in
04:52 - life and you can kick my ass at that
04:54 - thing so it all comes down to where we
04:58 - have failed more that's almost always
05:00 - what you'll find is a common denominator
05:02 - yet we hate this idea yet we hate this
05:05 - thing except the path to success in any
05:08 - of these things any of the things that
05:10 - you actually want to do and in in terms
05:13 - of your development coding as well you
05:15 - got to go through this beautiful thing
05:16 - called failure and a lot of it a lot of
05:20 - it with that said how can we go ahead
05:22 - and how what so what's the next logical
05:26 - step what is the next step what should
05:29 - we do how should we look at failure well
05:31 - here's how I look at it you have to
05:33 - think about the things you have control
05:35 - over and things that you actually don't
05:37 - have that much control over all right
05:38 - and then you got to control the things
05:40 - that you have control over so for
05:41 - example you know if you're driving a car
05:43 - and your car breaks down and you're in
05:45 - the middle of the highway
05:46 - most people's reaction is getting
05:48 - extremely stressed and they're freaking
05:50 - out and they're trying to control
05:51 - everything and they are they start
05:54 - getting super angry you know they'll be
05:55 - like how long will it take for you to
05:57 - get here to get me out of here you know
05:59 - they'll call the towing service towing
06:01 - company and that company might say oh
06:03 - it's gonna take us two hours and they're
06:05 - just so angry and they're fuming and
06:07 - then while that company is coming
06:09 - they're calling their friends and
06:10 - they're just venting whereas you could
06:13 - just choose to chill in those two hours
06:15 - listen to a book take a nap call a
06:18 - friend and actually just talk about
06:20 - random stuff fun stuff because you're
06:22 - like oh I just got to three hours
06:24 - or watch a movie in that time I've done
06:26 - all of those things I've been in those
06:28 - really bad situations especially with
06:30 - the car
06:31 - and it's just a matter of what you focus
06:34 - on and you just gotta focus on the
06:36 - things you can control there's certain
06:37 - things you can't control so if I can't
06:39 - control how quickly the towing company
06:42 - can come it's not worth my time or
06:45 - energy to get super passionate about the
06:46 - or is a toy company man like oh I gotta
06:49 - get going it adds more stress but stress
06:52 - it's good I love stress I get very
06:54 - worked up a lot of the times I do you
06:55 - have a quick temper as well but the
06:57 - problem is that I don't want to waste it
07:00 - on something I cannot control alright so
07:03 - when it comes to our success in life you
07:06 - people there's your this thing called
07:08 - resolved this is what everybody's
07:14 - focuses on and this is what we love what
07:18 - our results at the gym it means a
07:20 - six-pack if you talk about coding this
07:25 - means building an app who is Python or
07:31 - it could be job as a developer if we
07:40 - look at this these are the things that
07:42 - we actually pay attention to and we
07:44 - actually want it's the results we want a
07:47 - job as a developer we want to make an
07:48 - app we want to get that shredded
07:50 - six-pack physique but what do we have to
07:53 - go through that's pretty much undeniable
07:55 - to get these results we have to go to
07:58 - failure the more you fail at the gym the
08:00 - closer you'll get to getting a six-pack
08:02 - the more you fail at building an app
08:05 - with Python the closer you'll become to
08:07 - this goal of building an app with Python
08:09 - the more times you apply and fail to get
08:12 - a job as a developer the more likely
08:15 - you'll be to get a job as a developer
08:17 - yet and then on the other hand if we
08:20 - just focus on the results every day
08:22 - you'll come in and you'll just lift up
08:24 - your shirt you won't see a six-pack in
08:26 - the mirror you're gonna get discouraged
08:28 - you're gonna build you're gonna try to
08:30 - build the app and once you can't build
08:31 - it and then you try to just focus on the
08:33 - result you're gonna get discouraged same
08:35 - thing we're trying to get a job you
08:37 - don't get a job you're gonna feel
08:38 - extremely what discouraged so if we just
08:43 - focus on the results we set our
08:45 - selves up to always be disappointed and
08:49 - that's one so happy it caught in cost
08:52 - your happiness but the second thing you
08:54 - cost you is actually you don't get the
08:55 - results you try a few times you don't
08:58 - get the results you stopped all right
09:00 - so you can't focus on the results see
09:03 - the reason why I fail so much a table
09:05 - tennis is because I don't care about the
09:07 - freakin result I don't care about
09:09 - winning the game I don't care about some
09:11 - kind of crazy winning the best
09:13 - competition I care about the game I care
09:16 - about just playing it over and over
09:18 - again I just care about that feeling I
09:21 - get like like I just love how it feels
09:25 - right or I just love how chest feels or
09:28 - how soccer feels and I can just keep
09:30 - going in that game so coming back to
09:32 - this if we instead of falling in love
09:35 - with results if we fell in love with
09:39 - failure what would things look like now
09:42 - I know it's a weird concept to think
09:44 - about but what will things look like if
09:46 - we instead fall in love with failure so
09:49 - every day you look at did I actually
09:52 - fail today right did I actually hit the
09:56 - gym and fail the goals good all right
09:58 - that means I'm actually improving you
10:00 - want to look at did I try that business
10:03 - opportunity I said I was gonna try and
10:05 - fail that it good because if you focus
10:09 - on failure you're bound to go in the
10:11 - direction you want to go that's one two
10:13 - you are guaranteed to stay happy because
10:16 - what's worse than failure two normal
10:18 - people
10:19 - nothing failure is the ultimate quote
10:21 - unquote low so when you have your
10:24 - ultimate low as the thing that actually
10:26 - gives you a high and you get excited
10:28 - about now you you're gonna be
10:31 - happy in almost any given situation and
10:34 - any kind of result you get it's just a
10:36 - cherry on top still stay focused on your
10:39 - goals I'm not telling you not to stay
10:41 - focused on your goals I'm not telling
10:43 - you to sell yourself short or have a
10:45 - smaller goal what I am saying is shift
10:47 - your focus and fall in love with the
10:50 - right thing the thing that you call ugly
10:53 - is actually
10:54 - most beautiful thing you can have on the
10:57 - planet and the thing you're chasing
10:59 - after is a freaking siren if you look up
11:02 - in Greek mythology what a siren is is
11:04 - these beautiful beautiful female singers
11:08 - and they will lure you with your with
11:11 - their voice and once you go it's
11:13 - actually not the most beautiful female
11:16 - singer it's actually a frickin demon
11:19 - that will destroy your life and kill
11:20 - your murder you so results you should
11:23 - look at them like sirens and Greek
11:25 - mythology all right that's what these
11:27 - are so set your results set your goals
11:31 - of what you want but then forget about
11:33 - that
11:34 - then fall in love with failure count how
11:37 - many times have you failed okay when I
11:40 - wanted to start clever programmer I want
11:42 - to start this I remember talking to my
11:43 - friend and I remember this call it was
11:47 - two roughly almost three years ago now I
11:49 - think it was 2015 around October or
11:54 - December or something like that and I
11:56 - called them and I said yo or actually I
11:59 - don't 2016 16 probably I called him and
12:02 - I said I remember I said I want to fail
12:04 - I want to I want to work on a business
12:06 - and I want to fail as many times I want
12:09 - to fail five times in the next one month
12:12 - I want to fail five business ideas in
12:15 - the next one month so what does that do
12:18 - once my focus is on failure in the next
12:21 - one month now I'm now focused on being
12:24 - perfectionist now I'm now focused on it
12:26 - being great or incredible now I'm not
12:29 - focused on having these crazy
12:30 - expectations it's gonna be amazing
12:32 - so all that weight is actually gone I
12:35 - start taking action fast right away okay
12:39 - because I'm trying to get to my failures
12:40 - man I'm trying to get to my most
12:41 - beautiful failures because I know
12:43 - through the failures alone it's the only
12:45 - way I'll be able to succeed
12:47 - so I'm just trying to get to it faster
12:49 - I'm just trying to fail fast so then I
12:51 - can get to where I want to go and
12:52 - through that was what was clever
12:55 - programmer was developed so that is what
12:58 - I also was working on my chest channel
13:00 - chest astok through
13:01 - actually I started coding way harder
13:05 - because I wanted to fail in it again and
13:06 - again and again and it was addicting and
13:08 - it was exciting and it got me super
13:11 - inspired and so all the time I would be
13:14 - living in this epic state of feeling
13:16 - excited and feeling I'm hitting my goals
13:19 - every single day whereas when I was just
13:22 - focused on the results
13:23 - things got depressing very very very
13:26 - quickly because as soon as I would not
13:28 - get what I wanted
13:29 - I was just broken most of the times I
13:32 - found falling in love with my results
13:34 - made me lazy made me slower made me
13:39 - unhappy made me actually not get the
13:42 - result often time and overall it is not
13:46 - a way that I find exciting for me
13:49 - focusing on failure puts me in this
13:51 - incredible state of feeling gratitude
13:54 - all the time
13:55 - being happy being grounded and coming
13:57 - from that powerful energy where even in
14:00 - the worst moments I'm happy so anything
14:03 - on top of that is just a bonus and it's
14:05 - cherry on top so you can see what that
14:07 - level of energy will do to your work
14:10 - ethic well do the quality of your work
14:13 - will do the quantity of your work will
14:15 - do to the effectiveness of yourself and
14:18 - your life and your work and you can see
14:21 - how that will improve your efficiency
14:23 - just having a mindset and that different
14:27 - look in life this is what I wanted to
14:29 - share with you today I hope that you got
14:31 - value out of it I hope that you actually
14:32 - fall in love with the fear of failure
14:35 - but I do want you to take a second and
14:38 - comment below what is something you're
14:40 - scared of failing at and what is a
14:43 - commitment that you can make today to
14:46 - fall in love with you can run with this
14:49 - idea that I had right for me I use it
14:51 - for coding in business you can use it
14:53 - for something completely different
14:54 - but what would it be for you would you
14:56 - fall in love with the failure of you
14:59 - know failing at coding as many times as
15:01 - possible would you fall in love with
15:03 - failing at building an app or trying to
15:06 - get a job as a developer as many times
15:08 - as possible or something else what is it
15:11 - for you
15:11 - drop your comment below I will jump
15:14 - there check it out I'm gonna try to
15:15 - respond to as many people as possible
15:18 - and as always thank you so much for
15:20 - watching this is cause II I love your
15:23 - face and as always I'll see you in the
15:27 - next video
15:29 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey you what is up how's it going this is papa Python from clever programmer calm I also go by Kazi so you can call me whichever one you want today marks day 2 of the video challenge I'm doing which is gonna be a 30 day video challenge now if you want to use this time to go along with me and do a writing challenge or a coding challenge every morning or every day then you should do so with that said today I want to talk about this really cool concept I had this epiphany a few days ago and I'm not epiphany but something that kind of stuck in my mind and maybe you'll like it so I want to just share it with you so there's this thing called failure that we might be familiar with in our life all right now what is failure let's talk about failure failure often times means that you wanted to do something but it didn't happen you want it to set yourself up to start a business and make it successful but it didn't happen and it didn't become successful so you go ahead and you call that business a failure right so maybe like your business was a bust so I don't have a red marker but I'm just gonna use a purple marker and just say like the business idea failed and then we can have more types of failures so we can have a business failing we can have oh we failed to become a developer or failed to learn to code so it's like coding code you know that's right here Python I'm a failure so I can keep going down the list but we have this idea of failure and failure is actually a really really bad thing but here's what I want you to think about to think about anything in your life that you have gotten good at anything that you have gotten good at so it could be music it could be your ability to pen tap it could be your ability to juggle or play soccer or basketball or Vall whatever it may be for video games something that you got good at let me ask you a question how many times you so that's my question to you is how many times did you actually fail in the thing that you got good at so I'm willing to say that if you were to look at anything you got good at anything you consider yourself to be improved at or good at and then I want you to compare it to something you suck at something you're not very good at so for example I'm not very good at basketball I'm really bad at basketball okay so I'm gonna write down basketball here I'm really bad at basketball but I am a lot better at table tennis what is the difference between basketball and table tennis well why am i a much better at table tennis and then I'm really bad at basketball the only thing that's in between these two that differentiates them is that I have actually failed a lot more times in table tennis than I have in basketball I haven't taken enough shots to fail in a lot of shots or miss a lot of shots but in table tennis I have taken lots and lots and lots of L's and lots and lots of failures what is going on here well the point is this anything that you are actually good at you have failed at it more times than the thing that you suck at so what does that actually mean what that actually means is that this thing that we hate and despise and a lot of people have this thing called fear of failure which you know most people do we hate this thing it's a bad thing right it's a bad thing we don't like it I don't can't make a thumbsdown sign so I'm gonna make a arrow down we hate this thing it's a terrible thing it's a bad thing it's kind of like a disease for us except the more of this we have the more of success we have in the other things that we do in life all right if you fail a lot in coding like a lot of people watch my coding and they're like oh my god kasi you know you're so you're so good at you're so good at this or to look at somebody else's coding and they were like I can never be the software developer or that good really all that person did is fail a lot more times than you did right I failed a lot more times maybe the you know if depending on what your skill set is in coding but I probably feel a lot more times than you and that's why I am a little bit better at coding but you might have failed a lot more time that's something else in life and you can kick my ass at that thing so it all comes down to where we have failed more that's almost always what you'll find is a common denominator yet we hate this idea yet we hate this thing except the path to success in any of these things any of the things that you actually want to do and in in terms of your development coding as well you got to go through this beautiful thing called failure and a lot of it a lot of it with that said how can we go ahead and how what so what's the next logical step what is the next step what should we do how should we look at failure well here's how I look at it you have to think about the things you have control over and things that you actually don't have that much control over all right and then you got to control the things that you have control over so for example you know if you're driving a car and your car breaks down and you're in the middle of the highway most people's reaction is getting extremely stressed and they're freaking out and they're trying to control everything and they are they start getting super angry you know they'll be like how long will it take for you to get here to get me out of here you know they'll call the towing service towing company and that company might say oh it's gonna take us two hours and they're just so angry and they're fuming and then while that company is coming they're calling their friends and they're just venting whereas you could just choose to chill in those two hours listen to a book take a nap call a friend and actually just talk about random stuff fun stuff because you're like oh I just got to three hours or watch a movie in that time I've done all of those things I've been in those really bad situations especially with the car and it's just a matter of what you focus on and you just gotta focus on the things you can control there's certain things you can't control so if I can't control how quickly the towing company can come it's not worth my time or energy to get super passionate about the or is a toy company man like oh I gotta get going it adds more stress but stress it's good I love stress I get very worked up a lot of the times I do you have a quick temper as well but the problem is that I don't want to waste it on something I cannot control alright so when it comes to our success in life you people there's your this thing called resolved this is what everybody's focuses on and this is what we love what our results at the gym it means a sixpack if you talk about coding this means building an app who is Python or it could be job as a developer if we look at this these are the things that we actually pay attention to and we actually want it's the results we want a job as a developer we want to make an app we want to get that shredded sixpack physique but what do we have to go through that's pretty much undeniable to get these results we have to go to failure the more you fail at the gym the closer you'll get to getting a sixpack the more you fail at building an app with Python the closer you'll become to this goal of building an app with Python the more times you apply and fail to get a job as a developer the more likely you'll be to get a job as a developer yet and then on the other hand if we just focus on the results every day you'll come in and you'll just lift up your shirt you won't see a sixpack in the mirror you're gonna get discouraged you're gonna build you're gonna try to build the app and once you can't build it and then you try to just focus on the result you're gonna get discouraged same thing we're trying to get a job you don't get a job you're gonna feel extremely what discouraged so if we just focus on the results we set our selves up to always be disappointed and that's one so happy it caught in cost your happiness but the second thing you cost you is actually you don't get the results you try a few times you don't get the results you stopped all right so you can't focus on the results see the reason why I fail so much a table tennis is because I don't care about the freakin result I don't care about winning the game I don't care about some kind of crazy winning the best competition I care about the game I care about just playing it over and over again I just care about that feeling I get like like I just love how it feels right or I just love how chest feels or how soccer feels and I can just keep going in that game so coming back to this if we instead of falling in love with results if we fell in love with failure what would things look like now I know it's a weird concept to think about but what will things look like if we instead fall in love with failure so every day you look at did I actually fail today right did I actually hit the gym and fail the goals good all right that means I'm actually improving you want to look at did I try that business opportunity I said I was gonna try and fail that it good because if you focus on failure you're bound to go in the direction you want to go that's one two you are guaranteed to stay happy because what's worse than failure two normal people nothing failure is the ultimate quote unquote low so when you have your ultimate low as the thing that actually gives you a high and you get excited about now you you're gonna be happy in almost any given situation and any kind of result you get it's just a cherry on top still stay focused on your goals I'm not telling you not to stay focused on your goals I'm not telling you to sell yourself short or have a smaller goal what I am saying is shift your focus and fall in love with the right thing the thing that you call ugly is actually most beautiful thing you can have on the planet and the thing you're chasing after is a freaking siren if you look up in Greek mythology what a siren is is these beautiful beautiful female singers and they will lure you with your with their voice and once you go it's actually not the most beautiful female singer it's actually a frickin demon that will destroy your life and kill your murder you so results you should look at them like sirens and Greek mythology all right that's what these are so set your results set your goals of what you want but then forget about that then fall in love with failure count how many times have you failed okay when I wanted to start clever programmer I want to start this I remember talking to my friend and I remember this call it was two roughly almost three years ago now I think it was 2015 around October or December or something like that and I called them and I said yo or actually I don't 2016 16 probably I called him and I said I remember I said I want to fail I want to I want to work on a business and I want to fail as many times I want to fail five times in the next one month I want to fail five business ideas in the next one month so what does that do once my focus is on failure in the next one month now I'm now focused on being perfectionist now I'm now focused on it being great or incredible now I'm not focused on having these crazy expectations it's gonna be amazing so all that weight is actually gone I start taking action fast right away okay because I'm trying to get to my failures man I'm trying to get to my most beautiful failures because I know through the failures alone it's the only way I'll be able to succeed so I'm just trying to get to it faster I'm just trying to fail fast so then I can get to where I want to go and through that was what was clever programmer was developed so that is what I also was working on my chest channel chest astok through actually I started coding way harder because I wanted to fail in it again and again and again and it was addicting and it was exciting and it got me super inspired and so all the time I would be living in this epic state of feeling excited and feeling I'm hitting my goals every single day whereas when I was just focused on the results things got depressing very very very quickly because as soon as I would not get what I wanted I was just broken most of the times I found falling in love with my results made me lazy made me slower made me unhappy made me actually not get the result often time and overall it is not a way that I find exciting for me focusing on failure puts me in this incredible state of feeling gratitude all the time being happy being grounded and coming from that powerful energy where even in the worst moments I'm happy so anything on top of that is just a bonus and it's cherry on top so you can see what that level of energy will do to your work ethic well do the quality of your work will do the quantity of your work will do to the effectiveness of yourself and your life and your work and you can see how that will improve your efficiency just having a mindset and that different look in life this is what I wanted to share with you today I hope that you got value out of it I hope that you actually fall in love with the fear of failure but I do want you to take a second and comment below what is something you're scared of failing at and what is a commitment that you can make today to fall in love with you can run with this idea that I had right for me I use it for coding in business you can use it for something completely different but what would it be for you would you fall in love with the failure of you know failing at coding as many times as possible would you fall in love with failing at building an app or trying to get a job as a developer as many times as possible or something else what is it for you drop your comment below I will jump there check it out I'm gonna try to respond to as many people as possible and as always thank you so much for watching this is cause II I love your face and as always I'll see you in the next video
