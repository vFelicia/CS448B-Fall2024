00:00 - day one of building an AI SAS to 10K a
00:03 - month meet the team here's my co-founder
00:05 - Nas and here's me there's about 6 AI
00:08 - apps that we could be doing and we need
00:10 - to figure out which one is the most
00:11 - doable out of these ones then we
00:13 - realized the biggest problem is actually
00:15 - distribution who the is going to promote
00:17 - our software we started focusing on the
00:19 - creators instead and we're like let's
00:21 - actually build something for podcasters
00:23 - first so at this point we decided to
00:24 - meet AR because we were like we need
00:26 - help who's AR he's 19 years old makes
00:29 - $200,000 a month and has two sasses one
00:31 - is music Ai and one is cray. and the
00:35 - biggest lesson he taught us fin a cre
00:37 - like ol abdull and build a product for
00:39 - him second thing I was like yo re GPT
00:42 - only allows you to do 3.5 fine tuning
00:45 - but he taught me if I use Vector
00:48 - databases you can actually find tune GPT
00:50 - 4 which blew our minds so if you want to
00:52 - be on this journey with us headit follow
