00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hey I'm here for you so how did it go
00:03 - yesterday I know yesterday you were
00:05 - spending time coding hopefully
00:08 - and some of you might not even seen that
00:11 - video but I made a video recently where
00:12 - I was just like just put it on your
00:14 - calendar to code
00:16 - and a lot of you said they're committing
00:19 - to coding tomorrow and you schedule it
00:21 - in your calendar
00:22 - and you did that two hour block so for
00:25 - those of you who did how did it go and
00:27 - for those of you who didn't that's all
00:29 - right maybe schedule it for tomorrow and
00:31 - do it tomorrow
00:34 - but I want to talk about the concept of
00:36 - momentum and why momentum is so
00:40 - important for you
00:41 - you can be in a rut you can be stuck you
00:45 - can be feeling like you're not making
00:46 - progress but as long as you're showing
00:48 - up every single day
00:51 - I promise they are making progress I
00:53 - promise that you're moving forward even
00:55 - if it doesn't feel like it and sometimes
00:58 - gaining momentum is as simple as just
01:02 - showing up for that one day okay so that
01:05 - might be just showing up tonight for a
01:07 - little bit of time encoding that might
01:09 - be showing up tomorrow for a little bit
01:11 - of time encoding and so if you didn't do
01:13 - that yet I highly recommend you take the
01:16 - time now
01:17 - schedule on your calendar for tomorrow
01:18 - two hours you put a two hour block find
01:22 - it morning evening whenever you want
01:25 - but that is very very important
01:27 - there are some of you who said that you
01:29 - guys are going to do it I saw some of
01:31 - you tag me on the Instagram story and
01:33 - I've reposted your stories
01:36 - you guys can go check it out at my
01:37 - Instagram which is that clever causing
01:41 - but keep moving forward keep holding
01:44 - yourself accountable even right now I'm
01:45 - training Muay Thai right now at the gym
01:47 - and every day I go there honestly it
01:49 - doesn't really feel like I'm making
01:50 - progress if you ask me day by day basis
01:53 - I'm like I don't think I'm improving
01:55 - much but if you watch my footage and you
01:57 - look at me I'm improving significantly
01:59 - I'm completely different than I was even
02:01 - 15 days ago and that's just 15 days
02:05 - that's how it's going to be with coding
02:07 - you won't feel like you're making much
02:08 - progress and then a few days are going
02:10 - to pass and you're going to realize holy
02:12 - crap
02:13 - I am at a completely different level you
02:16 - got to give it time
02:18 - okay you got to give it time and you got
02:20 - to put in days and hours and just
02:24 - practice and get the momentum and you
02:26 - can even get the momentum with something
02:27 - very simple something very easy which is
02:29 - as simple as hey I'm just going to put
02:31 - in my calendar and go do it
02:33 - okay once you get that momentum going
02:35 - and you get that momentum up and running
02:37 - then you will be in a winning momentum
02:40 - then you won't have problems coding on a
02:42 - regular basis then you won't have
02:44 - problems sticking to the schedule or
02:47 - maybe you might even find it fun okay
02:49 - because it becomes a part of your
02:51 - routine so make it a part of your
02:53 - routine
02:54 - see what that does for you because I'm
02:57 - willing to bet you that that will do
02:58 - wonders for you if you can make it a
03:00 - part of your routine calmly show up
03:03 - every day clear your mind and just sit
03:05 - there and code
03:06 - there are many things you can do right
03:09 - that doesn't matter as much you could
03:11 - pick a little project to do you could
03:13 - make a little app to make a weather app
03:16 - you could you know make a little app for
03:19 - your friend your girlfriend whatever it
03:21 - may be
03:22 - it doesn't so much matter what you're
03:24 - doing as long as you're showing up every
03:27 - single day you'll make progress all
03:29 - right it's a tiny bits of progress is
03:32 - what you need in the atomic habits he
03:34 - talks about the concept of improving one
03:36 - percent every single day
03:39 - and so as long as you're improving one
03:41 - percent every single day I don't know in
03:42 - a year that's crazier if improved by I
03:46 - don't know 37 or 100 I have no idea but
03:48 - something ridiculous okay in that gear
03:50 - you would have improved a lot so just
03:53 - focus on that
03:55 - everyday practice every day approve and
03:58 - then it'll start to become muscle memory
04:00 - even with Muay Thai sometimes when I'm
04:02 - learning the calm but combinations are
04:04 - awkward I'm how do I throw that punch
04:08 - and then as I'm doing it more and more
04:09 - it just starts becoming smoother where
04:11 - I'm throwing my left hook with the you
04:14 - know jab I'm throwing the jab and I'm
04:15 - throwing up uh you know uppercut
04:18 - and then it starts becoming smoother and
04:20 - smoother and then I today I learned the
04:22 - spinning back Fist and I almost landed
04:24 - it on one of my friends that was nice
04:30 - but practice and learning all of this
04:33 - with practice I'm improving all of this
04:35 - and with practice I'm becoming smoother
04:38 - that's what will happen to you with code
04:40 - you'll be in the command line you'll
04:42 - keep feeling stuck you will feel man I
04:45 - just I want to be able to type in the
04:47 - command line how I see these guys do it
04:48 - because they do it so fast why am I
04:50 - stuck all the time I'm gonna you know be
04:53 - able to take this idea of
04:55 - grabbing data from an API whip it up and
04:58 - then extract that pull it into a CSV why
05:01 - can't I do that fast enough why am I so
05:03 - slow
05:04 - the reason is you might conceptually
05:06 - understand it you might have seen me
05:07 - coded you might have seen tutorials on
05:09 - it but you might have just not done it
05:11 - yourself enough and if you have not done
05:14 - it yourself enough
05:16 - and you will suck at it you know and you
05:19 - will be that great at it and you will
05:21 - always find it difficult
05:23 - so don't be that hard on yourself
05:26 - I said hard on
05:28 - so don't be that hard on yourself
05:30 - remember that with practice you'll keep
05:33 - improving so Focus really focus on the
05:36 - idea of practicing on a regular basis
05:39 - showing up on a regular basis even when
05:42 - I'm lifting I tell myself calm your mind
05:44 - just move your muscles so calm your mind
05:47 - move your hands and type and work calm
05:50 - your mind and just study learn something
05:52 - new with coding
05:55 - you'll have made so much progress
05:57 - so
05:59 - did you do it for those of you who
06:01 - watched the video one or two days ago
06:02 - with me talking about coding and you
06:05 - scheduled it did you actually follow
06:07 - through and do it if you actually follow
06:09 - through and do it I'm really proud of
06:10 - you let me know in the comments below if
