00:00 - - [Qazi] Hey you, what is up?
00:01 - How's it going?
00:03 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com,
00:06 - also known as Papa Python.
00:08 - Today I want to talk
to you about the power
00:11 - of how to think and solve
problems effectively.
00:16 - Alright, I wanna talk to you about how
00:18 - to think about code, how
you actually go about
00:20 - dealing with problems.
00:22 - One of the things that I
see with a lot of people
00:25 - that are starting out with
code, who are beginners,
00:27 - I was actually just on a call
00:28 - for my Profitable Shortcut program,
00:30 - it's a group coaching
program and we have lots
00:32 - of students in there and we
have questions like these,
00:35 - it's like, how do I improve in coding,
00:37 - I feel like I'm stuck.
00:39 - Either they find that
they're in this tutorial
00:41 - purgatory where they'll
spend a year learning
00:44 - something only to then forget it,
00:46 - and then, do it again,
and again, and again.
00:48 - And they never feel like it sticks
00:50 - or that they understand it.
00:51 - I made a video, oh by the
way this also day four
00:54 - of my video challenge,
so I'm doing a 30 days
00:57 - of videos, one video a day.
00:59 - So if you wanna do some kinda challenge
01:01 - do it with me and you can
also follow me on Instagram,
01:05 - CLEVERQUAZI, and I am a lot
more active on my Instagram
01:10 - and you can also follow me along
01:13 - and see everything that I'm doing
01:15 - including the challenges and my routine.
01:17 - But, back to the video.
01:18 - So how do you think about
your problems effectively
01:21 - and how do you actually improve?
01:22 - So in my previous video, I talked about
01:24 - what are the effective
tips to learn how to code?
01:28 - Alright, and that was also really amazing,
01:31 - I'm gonna pop that up right here.
01:33 - But, in this video I
wanna talk to you about
01:35 - how can you actually think
about solving problems.
01:38 - So let's say you have
some kind of problem.
01:40 - What do most people do, they
just start writing code,
01:44 - especially beginners.
01:45 - They just start writing code and they try
01:48 - and see if something works,
if something doesn't work,
01:50 - they just write more
code, print more stuff.
01:53 - But they're thinking about the program
01:54 - very, very linearly.
01:57 - It's this one thing.
01:59 - So, let's say you have to make,
02:01 - I'm gonna use a simple example,
let's say you have to make
02:04 - a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
02:05 - If they have to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game,
02:07 - they'll just start writing
it and they will think
02:10 - of everything as just one thing.
02:12 - So this includes, you know, they'll think
02:14 - of the diagonals and
the columns and the rows
02:18 - and all that as one thing
02:19 - and they start coding something up.
02:21 - But, what you actually
need to do before you start
02:24 - on a project like that is,
use frickin' whiteboard.
02:27 - Whiteboards are awesome,
so get a whiteboard
02:29 - if you don't have one, invest in one,
02:31 - it's one of the best
investments you can make.
02:33 - But, if you don't have a whiteboard
02:34 - just use a piece of
paper or something, okay?
02:37 - But you want to think about this problem
02:39 - and coding is thinking and I feel
02:41 - that sometimes people forget that.
02:43 - When they're following tutorials,
they're just typing stuff
02:45 - and following along, they're not
02:46 - actually, actively thinking.
02:48 - When they are trying to solve a problem,
02:50 - they're just like typing stuff,
02:51 - running it in the terminal
and see if it works.
02:53 - But, if you wanna go
about solving a problem
02:54 - you need to think about it.
02:55 - So, if I have to solve a problem
02:57 - like the Tic-Tac-Toe, right?
03:01 - I'm gonna be thinking about,
03:02 - I'm gonna break it up
into different components.
03:04 - So Tic-Tac-Toe, first of all,
03:06 - Tic-Tac-Toe I have to come up with a
03:09 - representation of the grid, of the board.
03:13 - So first I'm gonna be like, okay, first,
03:15 - the thing I'm gonna have to do is actually
03:17 - create a board, right?
03:19 - A three by three board.
03:21 - So you know, that might be
like this type of board, okay?
03:26 - And whatever, for now, I'm
just gonna have all X's
03:30 - in there or all zeroes
or ones, doesn't matter.
03:33 - But first I have to represent this,
03:36 - this is my first problem.
03:38 - Then my second thing is that
how do you detect a win?
03:45 - So I need to be able to detect a win.
03:46 - So what are some ways
you can detect a win?
03:48 - Well, okay.
03:49 - I can detect a win based
on rows, so if you have
03:53 - all three in a row you can win, right?
03:56 - And you have to check consecutively.
03:58 - Then I have to detect a win on the columns
04:01 - and then I have to detect
win on the diagonals.
04:05 - So that means that I'm
gonna create like a function
04:08 - and I'll have one function
that'll just be called
04:11 - like check rows.
04:13 - Pretty simple, right?
04:16 - So I'll write one function
and all that functions
04:20 - job is to check the rows.
04:22 - That's it.
04:23 - So what I'm doing is I'm
taking this giant problem
04:27 - and breaking it into its component parts.
04:29 - Taking this giant problem.
04:31 - It's almost like how
do you eat an elephant?
04:33 - How do you eat an elephant?
04:35 - You eat an elephant
very slowly in one bite
04:38 - at a time and over the course
of days, weeks and months.
04:41 - I never ate elephant but I
assume that's how you eat one.
04:43 - Probably can't eat one in one sitting.
04:46 - Most people code like
they're trying to eat
04:48 - the elephant in one sitting.
04:49 - It's not gonna happen.
04:50 - You have to break it down.
04:51 - You have to understand all
of the component problems
04:54 - that one problem has, right?
04:55 - It's a layer of problems.
04:57 - So I want to be able to check the rows,
04:59 - then I want to create a
function called check columns,
05:05 - alright, and then I'll create
a function called check diags.
05:12 - So now I'll have three
different functions.
05:14 - One function can check a row and tell you
05:18 - whether there's a win,
somebody has won or not.
05:22 - Then we have a function
called check columns
05:24 - and that can detect if
somebody has won on the columns
05:27 - or not, then we can have
check diags that can check
05:30 - if somebody's won on the diagonal or not.
05:32 - And then we can have something called
05:35 - check win, alright?
05:42 - So we have all these functions.
05:43 - The check win function,
well all this can be,
05:47 - it can just be comprised of
all three of these functions,
05:51 - right?
05:52 - Because you can just run
check win and then it will
05:54 - run check rows, check
columns, check diags,
05:57 - and it will run all
three of these functions
05:58 - until it finds a win, alright?
06:00 - So right now we're just trying
to think at a high level.
06:03 - We're not trying to get too
bogged down in the coding
06:05 - details of how it's gonna
work, what data structure
06:07 - we're using, we're
trying not to think about
06:10 - all those things.
06:11 - We're just trying to think at
a high level of this problem
06:13 - and try to solve it in
these basic components.
06:17 - Eventually you'll have this to-do-list
06:18 - and then all you do then,
then the part is easy,
06:21 - you write code, you do research,
06:23 - you figure out technically,
06:24 - but now you have a big goal of
what you actually need to do.
06:27 - Because otherwise most
of the people, you know,
06:29 - are coding blindly.
06:31 - I have all these
functions that can tell me
06:33 - if a win took place, right?
06:35 - And then I have functions
that can determine
06:38 - a loss, we can have a
function that can detect
06:40 - whose turn it is.
06:42 - Or whether it's nobody's turn, right?
06:46 - So we need some states
as well, for this board.
06:49 - We need to have a state where it tells us
06:52 - whether the game is still playing
06:54 - so for example, we can
have a still in play
06:59 - or we can have a state that says you know,
07:05 - game over, so I'm meaning somebody won.
07:09 - So what this would do is if
we have a while loop, right?
07:12 - And we're running this game
over and over and over again,
07:16 - then it would be in this state,
07:17 - it would always check if
the game is still in play,
07:21 - but if the game is not still in play
07:24 - and somebody has won and
somebody has connected
07:26 - all three in their rows,
columns, and diags,
07:29 - it will change the state
of the game to game over.
07:31 - And then it'll stop the game, right?
07:33 - And then a new game
might start after that.
07:36 - The point is not to solve this
07:38 - Tic-Tac-Toe problem right
here, right now, but
07:42 - my point is to get you to actually think
07:44 - at a higher level about
your coding problems.
07:48 - You need to break them
down into components
07:50 - and in the start it's gonna
require you to understand it
07:53 - in English or whatever
language is you know,
07:56 - your mother tongue, but first you're gonna
07:58 - actually need to understand
the problem in English
08:01 - and be able to describe it,
visually have it somewhere,
08:05 - then you need to break it
down into its component
08:08 - parts and know exactly
what you need to do.
08:11 - So first I will say understand in English.
08:18 - Two, break it down, okay.
08:25 - So you want to break the problem down into
08:28 - its component parts, that
way you know exactly what
08:31 - it is you need to do and then
you have a plan of action.
08:34 - So after this once you've broken it down,
08:38 - you know, you have a plan of action.
08:42 - And then it's simply about
what order you want to do
08:44 - this in, what it's gonna be.
08:46 - Are you gonna make check rows first,
08:47 - are you gonna make check win first?
08:48 - Are you gonna make check diags first?
08:50 - Or are you gonna make 3-D
board representation first?
08:53 - So it all is gonna be about you know,
08:56 - what your plan of action
is, and then once you get
08:59 - inside of a function, that's
when you start needing
09:02 - to worry about what data
structure you'll be using,
09:06 - how you'll be actually making it happen.
09:10 - You know, for example,
are you going to be using
09:12 - a dictionary or are you gonna
be using a list of lists
09:15 - to demonstrate a 2-D board, okay?
09:18 - So that, those are the
things that you're gonna need
09:20 - to think about later.
09:21 - So hopefully this video
has helped you or at least
09:24 - reminded you about some of the things
09:26 - you might have already
known, but I encourage you
09:28 - you know, again to do a
daily challenge with me
09:32 - because I'm doing a video challenge,
09:34 - you can do a thirty
minute or twenty minute
09:37 - video challenge with me.
09:38 - So I'm on day four of this,
so you can start tomorrow
09:41 - or the day after and
just go with me in this.
09:44 - With that said, I hope
this was helpful for you.
09:46 - Thank you so much for
watching and leave a comment
09:49 - on how you think you
can apply this, alright?
09:52 - I'm now being very engaged on my platform,
09:54 - on Youtube as well, so
I'm responding to a lot
09:56 - of people, but if you
really want to be able
09:58 - to get in touch with me or
you want to see my routine
10:03 - and behind the scenes
so you can be inspired.
10:05 - Or pick up a lot of tactics
and strategies from me,
10:08 - definitely follow me on Instagram because
10:11 - I am really really active there.
10:13 - I'm putting stuff there every single day
10:15 - so you can see a lot of
behind the scenes stuff.
10:18 - Alright, thank you so much for watching,
10:18 - as always, I love your
face and I'll see you
10:22 - in the next video.
10:26 - Yo guys, just finished video
four day four challenge,
10:31 - got my setup right here, we
talked about lots of cool stuff,
10:35 - let's keep going for
thirty days and if you have
10:37 - something you want to be
accountable for, hit me
10:39 - up or just do it, it's gonna be fun.
10:41 - Alright, peace.

Cleaned transcript:

[Qazi] Hey you, what is up? How's it going? This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com, also known as Papa Python. Today I want to talk to you about the power of how to think and solve problems effectively. Alright, I wanna talk to you about how to think about code, how you actually go about dealing with problems. One of the things that I see with a lot of people that are starting out with code, who are beginners, I was actually just on a call for my Profitable Shortcut program, it's a group coaching program and we have lots of students in there and we have questions like these, it's like, how do I improve in coding, I feel like I'm stuck. Either they find that they're in this tutorial purgatory where they'll spend a year learning something only to then forget it, and then, do it again, and again, and again. And they never feel like it sticks or that they understand it. I made a video, oh by the way this also day four of my video challenge, so I'm doing a 30 days of videos, one video a day. So if you wanna do some kinda challenge do it with me and you can also follow me on Instagram, CLEVERQUAZI, and I am a lot more active on my Instagram and you can also follow me along and see everything that I'm doing including the challenges and my routine. But, back to the video. So how do you think about your problems effectively and how do you actually improve? So in my previous video, I talked about what are the effective tips to learn how to code? Alright, and that was also really amazing, I'm gonna pop that up right here. But, in this video I wanna talk to you about how can you actually think about solving problems. So let's say you have some kind of problem. What do most people do, they just start writing code, especially beginners. They just start writing code and they try and see if something works, if something doesn't work, they just write more code, print more stuff. But they're thinking about the program very, very linearly. It's this one thing. So, let's say you have to make, I'm gonna use a simple example, let's say you have to make a TicTacToe game.
