00:28 - a time but other than that it should be
00:30 - good in this livestream we will be
00:33 - helping you level up your Python from
00:36 - zero to your first paycheck so if you're
00:39 - a complete beginner you're in the right
00:40 - place if you're intermediate you're in
00:42 - the right place and if you're somebody

03:59 - people registered and we're right now
04:02 - two days away from the webinar so we
04:04 - still have two solid days to go so with
04:09 - 2500 people I expect about three four
04:12 - thousand people to register and then
04:16 - that's it so it's pretty much one day
04:19 - one day and like 15 hours left to sign
04:23 - up and so yeah I recommend that if you
04:26 - guys are here
04:27 - the link is in the description bio on
04:30 - Instagram Facebook the link is at the
04:32 - bottom and go and check it out
04:36 - alright go sign up to it and show up to
04:39 - it I'll answer your questions there as
04:41 - well and in that webinar what you guys
04:43 - are gonna be getting is you know there
04:46 - there was part one of my video I
04:50 - launched the profitable programmer
04:52 - masterclass and so it had part one where
04:56 - we found out your Python earning
04:58 - potential and we found out like what the
05:00 - job market is for Python developers we
05:04 - figured out your lifestyle and then in
05:06 - the second one we figured it out why
05:07 - most programmers or write too many
05:10 - programmers are broke and how you can
05:11 - avoid it and in the third one what did
05:15 - we talk about Mustafar oh yeah he's
05:19 - making a cigar story cool so yeah if you
05:22 - guys are following us on instagram if
05:23 - you see Instagram story some of it is me
05:25 - some of it as my friend must have fought
05:27 - but in the third one we go a lot deeper
05:30 - into giving you the Python client
05:32 - getting system so I give you how to get
05:34 - clients and what's a full-on roadmap
05:36 - from getting a client attracted to you
05:39 - all the way to not only getting your
05:42 - money but putting that testimonial on
05:46 - your portfolio so in the webinar if you
05:50 - missed all three of those videos that
05:52 - were epic and you shouldn't have missed
05:54 - them but if you've missed them on the
05:56 - webinar we're gonna have we're gonna
05:58 - cover kind of all those videos in a
06:00 - short time we're gonna cover what they
06:02 - were about the most important points
06:04 - oh yeah and in the second video also you
06:05 - hand you a portfolio as well and then
06:09 - after that I'm gonna talk about my new
06:11 - course and my new course launches
06:13 - tomorrow or actually in two days but
06:18 - tomorrow I'm gonna be talking about my
06:20 - course on the webinar as well okay and
06:22 - taking your guys's questions so right
06:24 - now I will take on your guys's questions
06:28 - and then we'll go from there
06:30 - hi hope for all oh yeah the other day
06:33 - what I did on Instagram was I went live
06:35 - on Instagram and then I just
06:38 - you can apparently go live with other
06:40 - people on Instagram
06:41 - and so what I did is I just went live
06:45 - with a bunch of people so there was I
06:49 - talked to pre Nam I talked to Oprah all
06:52 - I talked to to other people their names
06:56 - are slipping me but yeah I just went
06:59 - live with them and then what Instagram
07:01 - does is it splits the screen in half for
07:03 - both of you and you're live and you're
07:05 - interviewing you're talking with them
07:07 - and everybody else in the audience can
07:08 - hear you so I'm answering your questions
07:10 - live it's a really cool feature and also
07:14 - Instagram was built off of what
07:16 - who knows what Instagram was built off
07:19 - of what programming language was used my
07:22 - friend here is raising his hand if you
07:23 - guys know type it in in the comments all
07:28 - right uh crew Todd Patel crew ptarth yes
07:40 - the varam says both Sunday and Monday
07:42 - webinars covers same topics on two
07:44 - different timings or two different days
07:46 - yes they're both they're just different
07:49 - timings but they cover the same main
07:52 - topic since I'm live I don't know what
07:56 - kind of crazy should I'm saying on
07:57 - either of the webinar knowing me I'm
07:59 - always like I'll go on these crazy
08:01 - tangents and these like deep thoughts so
08:05 - if you miss one or the other I don't
08:08 - know there might be some material that
08:10 - you miss but the main topic will be
08:12 - there okay so the main thing you won't
08:15 - miss if you join wear it one or the
08:16 - other okay cool we have a lot of people
08:21 - saying Python so it looks like these
08:23 - people know the power of Python that's
08:25 - really good yep Instagram is made off of
08:29 - Python and that's what we were using to
08:31 - go livestream with them
08:37 - um let me ask you guys some simple
08:39 - Python questions
08:41 - let's see where your guys are at and
08:44 - it's okay if you guys are completely at
08:46 - level zero or never written a line of
08:48 - code before because again that's what
08:50 - I'm here to help you with and my course
08:53 - is here to help you whether you're at
08:55 - zero intermediate or maybe even advanced
08:58 - because we had advanced web developer
09:01 - and her name is a-frame she she's
09:03 - awesome she was on we did an interview
09:06 - with her and she saved her company over
09:08 - twenty three thousand dollars with
09:10 - Python after taking my course so even if
09:12 - you're experienced you could still get a
09:14 - lot of value out of it now let me ask
09:16 - you guys some Python questions let's see
09:19 - if you have to put a bunch of things all
09:28 - right somewhere what data type would you
09:32 - use okay so let's say is just like a
09:36 - bunch of student names and it's Bob and
09:40 - Billy and John and dadadada the list of
09:46 - student goes on what data type would you
09:50 - use to store that information okay just
09:53 - a simple question
10:06 - all right Sam good job Sam you got it
10:10 - yeah Sam is is in my in my course so I'm
10:15 - not but Sam I'm disappointed that you're
10:20 - saying the word irate because that's a
10:22 - more java word but other but no your
10:24 - idea is right okay cool cool cool cool
10:30 - so most of the people said Nicholas says
10:33 - in a notepad no but in Python what data
10:36 - type to be used so that's funny yes
10:40 - everybody who says list good job and the
10:43 - list look like those brackets okay so
10:45 - it's like how am i imagine list to be is
10:47 - like a bucket and you just throw a bunch
10:49 - of things in there I have this plastic
10:51 - bag here so you can just imagine a list
10:55 - to be like this plastic bag and I take
10:57 - my infamous Mike you guys know this Mike
11:00 - and I just take it and boom I take my
11:05 - kombucha and I throw it in there boom
11:08 - this paper bag in Python we call it a
11:12 - list all right we call it a list now
11:16 - when I put things in this bag when I put
11:22 - this when I put this in a bag does the
11:31 - back here about the order of it like
11:34 - meaning if I put a lot of things in here
11:37 - and then I go back and look in this bag
11:38 - is it really easy for me to take out the
11:41 - things in the same order as I put them
11:43 - in
11:56 - oh and everybody who says we're a good
11:59 - job array is the right answer as well
12:01 - there's just different way of calling it
12:04 - okay yeah okay so we're getting a lot of
12:23 - people saying we got somebody on
12:25 - Facebook saying no Matt MEC says not
12:31 - unless you remember the order on
12:32 - Instagram and then we have people on
12:35 - YouTube saying no and nope and no Adi
12:39 - Bakar Bukhari Deathwish and Keon hope
12:45 - yeah so you guys are right there is no
12:49 - way to know the order maybe unless you
12:52 - remember it but it's too complicated
12:53 - like a plastic bag doesn't care about
12:56 - the order so a list though in Python
13:00 - remembers the order you put things in
13:03 - okay so imagine if this plastic bag had
13:06 - a way of telling you which thing was on
13:08 - position one which thing was on position
13:11 - two and which thing was on position
13:13 - three okay it remembers the order now
13:19 - can you guys think of where we would use
13:22 - something like lists in real life like
13:26 - let's say fate like on Facebook or
13:29 - Instagram or you know some some website
13:32 - that we all use where do you think you
13:35 - could give me an example of where a list
13:37 - is used in Python
14:03 - okay Justin says friends list on
14:06 - Facebook that's really good example
14:11 - Spotify to arrange the songs that's a
14:15 - really good example Sam kyon hope I
14:21 - butchered your name I'm sorry I'm sorry
14:24 - such as our life my name always gets
14:27 - messed up unfortunately friends list
14:31 - some people are saying storing names
14:33 - shopping listing and e-commerce storing
14:35 - contacts storing data keeping track of
14:40 - book index friends list on Facebook
14:43 - names phone numbers emails okay what you
14:51 - post on your timeline on Facebook very
14:53 - good student profile okay good good you
14:57 - guys are now getting the idea okay yes
15:00 - like images yes good good good so on on
15:06 - platforms okay again if you guys have
15:08 - something to write would you write this
15:09 - [ __ ] down this is exciting okay so you
15:11 - know exactly where a lot of these things
15:13 - are used so then when you're learning
15:14 - about it in Python it's not just boring
15:16 - and it's like I'm just learning about
15:17 - list a datatype
15:19 - structure it has more context and it's
15:22 - more fun so okay so let's take something
15:24 - like a list right and on Instagram you
15:27 - could use it to store images now if you
15:29 - put things in a list it's not like a
15:31 - paper bag right because in paper bag you
15:35 - don't remember what order you used but
15:36 - list remembers to order now the order is
15:38 - important because if I go on my
15:40 - Instagram I want to make sure that my
15:42 - recent pictures are at the top and my
15:45 - oldest pictures are all them at the
15:46 - bottom where else does order matter when
15:51 - I go on Facebook and I look at
15:53 - everything on somebody's Facebook wall I
15:55 - want to see the recent Facebook post at
15:58 - the top and everything else at the
16:00 - bottom right the oldest Facebook post
16:02 - where else is order important when I
16:06 - order when I was put things into my
16:08 - shopping cart I want them to be in the
16:11 - right order
16:11 - or when I review my recent orders on
16:14 - Amazon and see everything that
16:16 - bought I want to go down the list like
16:18 - boom boom boom boom boom and see which
16:20 - thing was purchased when you know what's
16:22 - the time of it so those are some
16:26 - examples in real life wirless reviews
16:28 - now how about Netflix okay we have all
16:32 - these movies we got to store them
16:34 - somewhere so maybe we could use a list
16:38 - for that okay so always be thinking
16:41 - about this
16:43 - however in somewhere like Netflix we
16:46 - don't necessarily care about the order
16:48 - that much okay so maybe my gain is a
16:56 - little bit low
16:58 - iPhone storage full all right let's see
17:08 - hello hello hello um how is the audio
17:12 - doing on YouTube are you guys able to
17:15 - hear me clearly or is it a little low
17:22 - yeah what Steph says I love Netflix yeah
17:26 - what's up bro how's it going
17:30 - tenzin just joined my live stream on
17:33 - instagram it's my good friend what about
17:36 - creating an MVP for your company mm-hmm
17:44 - sorting good
17:45 - Bharath seems like it seems like Bharat
17:49 - Bharat knows a thing or two about what
17:52 - we're talking about okay we have
17:54 - somebody asking for different books so
17:58 - I'm gonna give you guys a book okay
18:01 - don't go anywhere hold up a second all
18:06 - right don't freak out I'm right here got
18:10 - a book this is a book recommendation I
18:14 - have used this book to learn Python and
18:17 - this is a book I'd like to recommend to
18:19 - people so for the people who are asking
18:21 - for a book here you go
18:29 - that's hilarious so Tenzin just said
18:33 - just at Walmart doing grocery my grocery
18:36 - list doesn't care about order it's a
18:38 - little yeah so your grocery list doesn't
18:41 - care about ordering doesn't need to if
18:42 - it had to care about order it would just
18:44 - be inefficient and because it ultimately
18:47 - wouldn't matter so yeah there are other
18:56 - good books out there like learn Python
18:58 - the hard way
19:01 - what I most love about you Kazi it's
19:04 - your mic god Paulo broke my heart okay
19:09 - say it's clear what about learning
19:17 - Python the hard way yep luck [ __ ] that
19:19 - is a good book I am a fan of this to be
19:22 - honest because it goes through like
19:24 - building actual projects - I mean learn
19:27 - Python the hard way does as well but I'm
19:29 - a fan of I don't know I'm just a fan of
19:31 - this you created these games and stuff
19:34 - and I like it you know I kind of nerd
19:36 - out on this book a little bit you create
19:39 - like tennis simulations and here's just
19:43 - a rule of thumb with books I talked with
19:45 - my good friend Ben marks he works at
19:47 - Google and he writes code and Python
19:50 - every single day and he was telling me
19:53 - that when you are using Python or sorry
19:56 - when you are learning coding and you're
19:58 - trying to learn it from a book one of
20:01 - the best things to do is just go to a
20:02 - book with a lot of exercise and my
20:04 - friend um Jude said the same thing okay
20:06 - um Jude is one of the founding engineers
20:08 - at code Academy and if any of you guys
20:10 - have used repple it or have seen me use
20:12 - droplet repl i.t um Jude was the founder
20:18 - of it okay so um Jude also says find
20:21 - books that just have a lot of exercises
20:24 - in them so if you're gonna get a Python
20:26 - or coding book just pick it up and just
20:28 - go through it and just see how many
20:30 - exercises it has and if it looks like
20:32 - you're working on a lot of hands-on
20:34 - exercises and projects then you're in a
20:37 - good place
20:40 - the author of this book is john's l jo
20:43 - hn ze ll e john's l ha was ml hi how are
20:51 - you doing man how's it going I love the
20:56 - way you speak English so much it's easy
20:59 - to understand you're the first speaker I
21:01 - can understand what you say without
21:03 - using subtitles beautiful um yes I I
21:08 - sound sometimes crazy in real life
21:09 - trying to enunciate every word so
21:11 - clearly but hopefully it comes off clear
21:15 - to you guys and you guys understand it
21:16 - well so thank you for letting me know
21:18 - that and that helps me try to just focus
21:22 - on speaking clearly more um you could
21:28 - get the book from Amazon somebody just
21:29 - asked where do people get the book from
21:31 - you can go on Amazon and get it or I
21:34 - don't know if you have some coding
21:35 - stores nearby I it's such a thing exists
21:38 - the coding stores if it doesn't then we
21:40 - got to open it I mean guys after this
21:43 - course launch is over we're gonna be
21:45 - trying to open up a coding store near
21:47 - you yeah Graham you know it grinding on
21:51 - a Saturday night
21:53 - got a date coming up soon but whatever
21:56 - you know it's its grind time baby you
22:01 - guys are more important get it from PDF
22:04 - okay I want to learn how to code but all
22:07 - the courses are in other languages any
22:09 - suggestions
22:10 - Python is awesome again my course is
22:13 - gonna be opening up soon so if you are
22:16 - excited about it you want to find out
22:18 - more about it how the course works what
22:21 - it covers what kind of practical
22:23 - applications we'll be building
22:25 - how I'll be showing you where to go and
22:27 - get your clients how I'll be showing you
22:29 - how to land those clients how I'll be
22:31 - giving you the exact roadmap to become a
22:33 - developer in 90 days it's hard work it's
22:37 - hard work don't get me wrong if you
22:40 - think this is like oh I'm just gonna go
22:41 - there and it's just all gonna work and
22:43 - I'm just gonna make money it's just
22:44 - gonna shower on me that's not gonna
22:46 - happen but if you follow the roadmap and
22:49 - you work on the things that I'm laying
22:50 - out for you since we're gonna be
22:53 - learning and building practical stuff at
22:55 - the same time by the end you're gonna be
22:56 - ready to get that job so if you're
22:59 - interested make sure to show your face
23:02 - on that webinar

23:10 - time out and have you guys register for
23:12 - that webinar because that webinar is
23:14 - awesome it's called level up your Python
23:16 - from zero to your first paycheck
23:19 - I want to get all of you guys in there

24:16 - recommend unfortunately I never took any
24:18 - coding course on iTunes U but I can
24:21 - recommend you a podcast
24:22 - it's called slipping my mind programming
24:26 - throwdown
24:27 - I used to listen to that all the time in
24:30 - when I was going to college and I would
24:34 - be taking the train and I would be like
24:36 - I would have my headsets and be
24:37 - listening to programming throwdown they
24:40 - talk about like and advanced stuff and
24:42 - some of it is not even relevant but I
24:44 - just enjoy it a lot I know my friend
24:46 - Tenzin he hates it and he hated me for
24:49 - recommending it to him but I don't know
24:51 - Mike out on that and I enjoy it
25:02 - okay cool Azim says I've signed up good
25:05 - good good good we got a bunch of people
25:09 - saying 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 good good good
25:16 - what kind of skill is required everybody
25:20 - wants to know the price of the course
25:21 - that's I'm also gonna tell you guys the
25:23 - price of the course it hasn't been
25:25 - finalized but if you're on the webinar
25:27 - you will find out okay everybody on the
25:29 - webinar you will find out what level of
25:34 - skill is required if you're talking
25:35 - about the course you can be at zero
25:37 - skill never even Thank You Renee that's
25:42 - awesome thank you for writing that but
25:45 - yeah if you even have zero skills you're
25:47 - good one and a half day he'll have too
25:50 - much time ugh [ __ ] yeah I know you're
25:52 - excited buddy

26:17 - get like text reminders so make sure
26:20 - that you know you put in all that stuff
26:24 - in the webinar when you're registering
26:25 - and then put in your phone number as
26:27 - well and then I'll personally send out a
26:29 - text to you so that you can get a
26:31 - reminder before it starts the webinar
26:38 - you don't need any skill level to come
26:40 - to the webinar you can have zero coding
26:43 - skills even if you're more intermediate
26:45 - or advanced that's totally okay we're
26:48 - not we're not coding in the webinar
26:58 - all right let me see best website to
27:08 - learn Django there are a couple of good
27:10 - resources for Django one of them being
27:12 - one of my good friends Justin Mitchell
27:15 - from coding for entrepreneurs and he has
27:19 - a lot of stuff on Django and he also has
27:22 - a YouTube channel on Django in this
27:25 - course we're gonna be covering a lot of
27:28 - Django so yeah I think this will be the
27:31 - best Jenga course available we'll be
27:34 - going we're and but in this course we're
27:37 - not just covering a framework we're
27:40 - covering like how to actually do web
27:42 - development with Python
27:44 - so while specific frameworks are
27:47 - important I'm gonna be showing you guys
27:49 - how to become a good web developer and
27:51 - then I'll help you choose your specific
27:53 - framework so we'll have some stuff in a
27:55 - framework like flask and then we'll have
27:57 - some stuff in a framework like Django
28:02 - awesome we got a lot of people signing
28:05 - up for the webinar great how many people
28:07 - do we have now registered for the
28:08 - webinar
28:10 - good job somebody else just registered
28:13 - awesome it's good to know let me
28:15 - actually or actually hold on oh no I
28:20 - don't have my phone thank you thank you
28:22 - thank you let me let me get that bad boy
28:25 - let's see let's see here what is going
28:29 - on
28:38 - okay
28:46 - [Music]
28:51 - okay sweet so we are about to hit the
28:56 - 2500 registrants mark that's good so if
29:01 - you guys have signed up good job awesome
29:03 - I even have a special video that I'm
29:07 - gonna be making for you guys that you
29:08 - people who registered on the webinar are
29:10 - gonna get no no I'm not cool and then
29:16 - for everybody else if you haven't
29:18 - registered go register and yeah and if
29:22 - you send this out a cool email or
29:24 - something will try to read it live on
29:26 - the webinar
29:37 - yeah we got lots of comments on that
29:40 - profitable programmer master class we
29:42 - hit like over a thousand comments we had
29:45 - about 20,000 plus people watch watch
29:50 - right at about 20,000 plus people go
29:52 - through the profitable programmer master
29:55 - class yeah that was insane that happened
29:58 - last week so if you guys missed it not a
30:00 - problem if you come to the webinar we
30:03 - will be touching on those you won't the
30:06 - whole thing isn't gonna be there but
30:08 - we'll be touching on the most important
30:09 - and meaty things from that because I
30:11 - know a lot of you might not have that
30:13 - much time a lot of you might be busy so
30:15 - that's gonna be your best chance now let
30:24 - me ask you guys another let's do another
30:27 - Python question should we do another
30:30 - Python question all right first of all
30:34 - let's do that should we do another
30:36 - Python question for you guys
30:55 - yeah seem knowing knowing Opie's good ok
31:01 - it's still hard to hear right ok um I
31:08 - just moved the gain up a little bit more
31:10 - do you want to have like a headset in or
31:11 - something so you can hear it I don't
31:13 - know if you're gonna get do you think
31:14 - you're gonna get feedback from this no
31:21 - like the annoying feedback okay yeah
31:25 - check it out all right cool so let's so
31:31 - let's do this okay so what about if you
31:34 - need to store information and again guys
31:35 - these questions are basic and even if
31:38 - you don't know them that's totally fine
31:40 - but it's starting good to start thinking
31:43 - about this stuff so let's say that you
31:46 - have you know where what kind of data
31:49 - type in Python would you use to store
31:52 - let's say names and then phone numbers
31:55 - that go with them okay
31:57 - so you have name and then you have a
31:59 - phone number then you have another name
32:01 - and then you have another phone number
32:02 - so then when you later want to look it
32:05 - up you can just try to look up the name
32:07 - and they'll give you the phone number
32:09 - that's associated with it so what kind
32:12 - of bucket in Python would you throw that
32:14 - into and in a little bit I'll make it a
32:20 - multiple choice so for those of you guys
32:22 - who totally have no idea that's okay
32:24 - you'll find out somebody's had sequel
32:28 - hold on you're getting a little advanced
32:31 - and we are talking about Python right
32:32 - now okay cool so we actually have a
32:41 - bunch of people who know about this
32:44 - datatype awesome awesome
32:46 - so we have somebody saying dictionary
32:48 - array is not the right answer Muhammad
32:54 - list is close but it's not list so it's
32:58 - either between lists and dictionaries
32:59 - and since I just said it's not list
33:02 - obviously it's not list so yeah
33:04 - everybody who said dictionary good job
33:08 - okay not a big deal if you didn't know
33:11 - this one
33:12 - but dictionaries where you can just put
33:14 - a key we call it four and that's your in
33:18 - our case we'll put the key as a name
33:20 - make the key whatever something that's
33:22 - easy to remember so we'll put name as
33:24 - the key and the value get out of it as a
33:26 - phone number now on Netflix on Netflix
33:31 - the key would be the name of the movie
33:35 - and the value might be the actual movie
33:38 - itself okay can you guys give me some
33:42 - real-world examples of a dictionary of a
33:46 - key and a value maybe it's I don't know
33:51 - in groceries store you found it maybe on
33:54 - Amazon maybe on Instagram maybe on
33:57 - something else can you give me an
33:59 - example of where we might use dictionary
34:02 - in real world
34:34 - student number spotify everywhere
34:39 - walmart price list I have no idea some
34:44 - people are saying some people are saying
34:46 - snapchat
34:55 - let's see username and passwords okay
34:58 - good registration and login that's
35:00 - another good one
35:01 - okay so that's a good way to think about
35:03 - it your username is a key and your
35:07 - password is the value all right phone
35:09 - contacts same thing the name is the key
35:13 - and the phone number is a value so if
35:16 - you go down the list and then other
35:18 - things in real life if you look up a
35:20 - specific order and you click on it maybe
35:23 - the price is the value okay so in real
35:27 - world we have lists and dictionaries
35:28 - being used all around us even though
35:31 - sometimes when you're coding and they're
35:33 - teaching you about data types like lists
35:36 - and dictionaries you can't relate you're
35:39 - like what how are we using this in real
35:42 - world so it's important whenever you're
35:44 - learning something have that you know
35:47 - that context in mind you know have the
35:50 - real context of why you're doing this
35:51 - and how this could be helpful to you and
35:56 - for dictionaries the symbol is like this
36:00 - okay in Python I'm just gonna type that
36:02 - in for you guys so it's kind of like a
36:05 - squiggly squiggly thing yep good job Sri
36:10 - SRI's EV MJ Saudagar pricelist azim says
36:15 - student ID good bus ticket good job
36:34 - yep curly braket good what does that
36:40 - joke how does it go
36:41 - why do Java developers wear glasses who
36:48 - knows this one why do Java developers
36:51 - wear glasses
36:55 - man this kombucha is good
37:13 - did you look this up huh
37:16 - nobody on Facebook got it ah okay
37:20 - we got first person on Instagram who got
37:22 - it good we got somebody on Instagram who
37:27 - got it as well another person to see the
37:32 - brackets good andreas got it Muhammad
37:36 - Farhan got it good
37:38 - Ibrahim got it Grundy got it as well
37:42 - good yep it's because they can't see
37:46 - sharp mm-hmm
37:51 - Java is hard I mean don't get me wrong
37:55 - all these languages are good and pop and
37:57 - useful and powerful right but my biggest
38:00 - problems come with don't care somebody
38:01 - starting out and they're learning why to
38:04 - do something like print hello world the
38:06 - easiest thing on the planet you have to
38:09 - make a class and you have to compile and
38:13 - you have to learn how to use the
38:15 - terminal and there's not a good place to
38:18 - just run it in the browser like what's
38:20 - up with that that's my problem when it
38:23 - comes to languages like Java C C++ and
38:26 - all these other languages they're great
38:28 - but why did they make it so hard like
38:30 - javascript for example makes your life
38:32 - pretty easy you could go in your Chrome
38:35 - right now and run JavaScript and boom
38:37 - you're running it and then Python is the
38:41 - same way you can go to a simple website
38:43 - like repple it and there's a terminal
38:46 - and you get instant feedback and you can
38:48 - be running your code ok you could go
38:51 - into your command line and most of the
38:56 - most of mac books or most every Apple
39:00 - product every Apple computer already
39:02 - comes with Python installed and then on
39:04 - windows installing it takes like 2
39:06 - seconds so even if you want to run it
39:08 - locally and you don't need to make a
39:09 - class you don't need to make you don't
39:12 - need to know how this whole command-line
39:14 - things work you'd pretty much don't need
39:17 - to know anything you can run the code
39:19 - right away
39:22 - cool all right let me take some of your
39:26 - guys's questions Stefan says hey man I
39:35 - have a question for you I really want to
39:37 - learn programming and I really started
39:38 - once but I lost my passion and
39:41 - motivation for for it does that mean I'm
39:43 - not for it or what you're gonna lose
39:48 - passion and motivation and then it's
39:50 - gonna come back it's it's like like I'm
39:56 - Jude said a sine wave it's a horrible
39:58 - way to describe it only people who do
40:00 - math or know anything about math will
40:02 - get it but it's like waves you know
40:05 - you'll get really motivated and you'll
40:07 - be like yeah motivated and then you
40:09 - start going down and then all of a
40:11 - sudden you feel motivated and passionate
40:13 - again and then it goes down it comes in
40:15 - cycles but motivation can be reversed
40:18 - engineered so motivation and passion is
40:21 - not what you guys think it is it's not
40:25 - this random thing that happens by luck
40:27 - all of it could actually be reversed
40:31 - engineered and you could turn into a
40:33 - system and make yourself be motivated
40:36 - and passionate so for example as human
40:41 - beings we are really dumb okay we are
40:45 - really really really really stupid as
40:48 - human beings here's what that means
40:50 - whatever is happening around us
40:53 - influences us and what you think are
40:56 - your thoughts aren't actually not your
40:59 - thoughts at all these are thoughts that
41:03 - you have based on the environment that
41:06 - you're in the people that you're around
41:07 - the media that you're consuming that's
41:12 - what is that's what those thoughts are
41:14 - actually comprised of they're not your
41:16 - own they're just a mixture of all these
41:18 - and that unique combination that gets
41:21 - marinated that's inside your head that's
41:24 - what you think is the unique you and are
41:27 - your thoughts now knowing that we could
41:31 - be really depressed that we are really
41:32 - stupid or knowing that
41:34 - be really happy because we could
41:36 - reverse-engineer it a lot of things in
41:38 - our life so for example if I feel less
41:41 - passionate or motivated when I'm driving
41:45 - I don't listen to music because it's a
41:47 - waste of time listening to music it's
41:51 - sometimes good if you're using it to get
41:53 - yourself palm-tree of working on
41:55 - something to get yourself focus but if
41:56 - you're driving it's just a waste of time
41:58 - why not listen to books on something
42:02 - like audible why not when you're in a
42:05 - train and you got your headsets in or
42:07 - you're doing a commute listen to books
42:09 - and you could listen to books that
42:12 - motivate you or talk about coding or
42:15 - programming that's one thing you could
42:18 - do here's another amazing crazy hack
42:21 - that's life-changing when you are at
42:23 - home and you're about to eat your food
42:26 - why waste all that time just sitting
42:28 - there eating food looking at a wall or
42:31 - what do some of us do we eat food while
42:35 - watching house of cards while watching
42:37 - stranger things or suits or I don't know
42:40 - whatever news channels or cat videos or
42:44 - just you stuff on YouTube or surfing the
42:46 - internet whatever it may be for you
42:48 - instead of doing that why not watch cool
42:52 - stuff you could be building with code or
42:55 - maybe there's a new problem in coding
42:57 - that you've hit and now you're stuck so
42:59 - you're looking up how to solve it or
43:01 - you're looking at coding tutorials and
43:03 - you're eating food and looking at that
43:05 - at the same time alright so if you
43:10 - replace your car time and all that other
43:12 - nonsense just release your music with
43:15 - stuff about coding and you're watching
43:17 - stuff about coding and coming up with
43:19 - new ideas those are the easiest hacks so
43:22 - you can start implementing right now or
43:24 - also you could go to local meetups where
43:28 - there are other people who think about
43:31 - coding who dream about coding who love
43:33 - it and want to build amazing things now
43:36 - this is something important to you and
43:37 - you start applying all three of these
43:40 - things I just told you you know changing
43:42 - the circle of your friends because you
43:44 - know they say the five friends around
43:46 - you
43:48 - right the five closest people to you
43:54 - you're not only just the average of them
43:57 - but quantifiably that it's actually
44:01 - measurable and your average salary is
44:05 - also the average of the five people
44:07 - around you and how much they make okay
44:10 - so for those of you who like to think
44:12 - very objectively like me even if you
44:15 - don't believe that other whole thing
44:17 - about you're the average of the five
44:18 - closest people to you if you look around
44:21 - what their salaries are and you see what
44:23 - your salary is you're like whoa we're
44:25 - all really close that should be you know
44:29 - that should tell you something so if
44:32 - those people are not about coding or not
44:34 - passionate about their life or not
44:36 - trying to reach their goals or not
44:38 - trying to move themselves forward or not
44:39 - motivated and not motivating you and not
44:42 - believing in you maybe just maybe it's
44:47 - time to expand that inner circle to
44:51 - other people and those people who don't
44:53 - care for you or are there for you to
44:56 - make yourself feel comfortable but don't
44:58 - really push you or challenge you or move
45:00 - you to do new things maybe just maybe
45:02 - it's time to cut them out all right so
45:07 - you combine replacing music with books
45:10 - you combine or placing Netflix and the
45:13 - stupid [ __ ] you watch and you waste your
45:15 - time an average American spends 40 hours
45:18 - a week and my phone just died so my live
45:20 - stream is dead let's figure out what's
45:22 - going on with this bad boy but think
45:27 - about this okay
45:28 - average American spends 40 hours a week
45:29 - on TV so most of us complain about not
45:33 - having time we have time we just spend
45:37 - it on a lot of weird things and I'm not
45:39 - putting myself above it I do it all the
45:41 - time that's why I have these things in
45:44 - the back of my head because while I am
45:46 - teaching you and sharing this with you
45:48 - I'm mostly getting the most benefit for
45:51 - myself because it reminds me to do these
45:53 - things because I'm the one also who's
45:57 - not spending time doing the right things
45:59 - so if we can
46:01 - our habits we can reverse engineer being
46:06 - motivated and passionate and being at
46:10 - that level that we want to be at and we
46:13 - don't have to condemn ourselves anymore
46:14 - for not having that passion or that
46:17 - motivation hopefully that answers your
46:22 - question
46:34 - okay so somebody so he just said um you
46:39 - have a wife and she needs time to and of
46:42 - course she does but also keep in mind
46:44 - people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people
46:47 - like Grant Cardone
46:48 - also have a wife but they're run like
46:51 - multiple businesses there are multi
46:54 - millionaires they change the lives of
46:56 - millions of people they work non-stop
47:00 - yet they still find the time to keep up
47:04 - with their health they still spend
47:06 - quality time with their children and to
47:09 - still spend quality time with their
47:11 - family so don't lie to yourself that you
47:14 - don't have time I'm not gonna lie to
47:17 - myself that I don't have time we mess up
47:20 - but we just need to be honest with why
47:22 - we're making those mistakes okay that's
47:25 - where your real change is gonna come
47:27 - from if you can't look at yourself in
47:30 - the mirror and be honest with yourself
47:31 - don't expect anybody else to change your
47:34 - life I can't change your life that
47:37 - person next you can't change your life
47:38 - and if you're not gonna be honest with
47:40 - yourself you can't change your life
47:43 - either so start from there start from
47:47 - being honest with yourself exactly where
47:49 - you are in your relationship in your
47:52 - career in your life your friends near
47:57 - you right you're a girlfriend boyfriend
48:02 - your wife husband whatever start there
48:05 - and just go through the list and see
48:07 - what level each of those things are at
48:10 - are you happy making the money or making
48:12 - every year are you happy being able to
48:16 - just go from paycheck to paycheck are
48:19 - you happy
48:20 - doing things in a way that's average
48:23 - where you know you could be doing better
48:28 - if you're not then there are things that
48:32 - need to change and to start that change
48:35 - you need to start by being honest with
48:37 - yourself okay because if you make
48:40 - excuses and if you let yourself off the
48:42 - hook and you say things like oh but I
48:45 - have this too so that needs time too
48:48 - while that is true you have those 24
48:51 - hours if you juice them and you melt
48:53 - them you can get a lot done alright you
48:57 - can get a lot done like I'm gonna tell
49:02 - you from my personal experience and I'm
49:04 - not amazing or anything I am you know I
49:07 - was a dumb college kid and now I'm just
49:10 - a kid who's trying to run clever
49:12 - programmer and make sure you guys get
49:13 - massive value out of it but when I was
49:18 - building clever programmer you know this
49:20 - is the fastest channel to go from zero
49:22 - to a hundred thousand subscribers for
49:25 - coding ever how did that happen was was
49:28 - there magic involved no I was spending
49:31 - like hundreds of hours a week I was
49:34 - still spending time with my family I
49:36 - still kept up with my friends you guys
49:39 - still see my friends in my Instagram
49:41 - Facebook stories on snapchat and even on
49:45 - YouTube and even on my live streams from
49:47 - time to time I still kept up with my
49:48 - family I still kept up with my friends I
49:50 - still had a job I was doing I was a
49:54 - coaching students for programming and
49:57 - chess and video editing and all kinds of
50:00 - stuff and students from 20 years of age
50:02 - to 60 years of age students who were
50:04 - going to kindergarten to students who
50:09 - were 45 years old and doing their PhD
50:12 - program for analytics and needed to use
50:15 - Python for machine learning I was also
50:20 - playing chess competitively at the time
50:23 - and going to tournaments I was also
50:25 - going to ping pong tournaments at the
50:28 - same time I was building this channel
50:31 - like a maniac okay I was also in a
50:36 - relationship at that time I was also
50:40 - going to the gym I was also getting
50:44 - really good sleep and now we have a
50:50 - full-on company what started as a dream
50:54 - just a hope and dream and aspirations
50:57 - and I was like maybe you know one day
50:59 - people will look at this and get value
51:01 - out of it
51:01 - maybe clever programmer will be able to
51:03 - provide value to other people maybe I
51:06 - can help somebody who's not just me and
51:08 - a lot of these things that I learned I
51:10 - can share this with other people because
51:12 - I was I don't want to hold this to
51:14 - myself because I thought what's the
51:16 - point of being alive if you can't
51:18 - provide value to others and if others
51:20 - don't know about you
51:21 - and what started as a dream a year ago
51:26 - right now we have hundreds of thousands
51:28 - of students on our YouTube we have
51:31 - millions of people of viewers on YouTube
51:33 - we have a lot of people on an Instagram
51:36 - Facebook and we have over hundreds
51:39 - hundreds of thousands of students who've
51:41 - went through our coding courses and
51:44 - people have gotten jobs people have gone
51:47 - promoted at their work people have gone
51:50 - internships for you know as Python
51:52 - Django people have who are web
51:56 - developers have saved their company over
51:59 - twenty three thousand dollars people
52:02 - have become Python web developers and
52:04 - now even have clients people have done
52:09 - things there was a person who was a
52:10 - freelancer CG generalist and after
52:13 - taking my course he was able to do
52:15 - something that was taking the other team
52:17 - in Brazil seven days to do he was able
52:20 - to automate it with Python in four hours
52:22 - and made $1,200
52:25 - all right so all of this stuff happening
52:31 - and getting people results and making
52:35 - sure to be there with my students and
52:37 - always being there with you guys and
52:38 - listening to you guys and responding to
52:39 - your emails and your comments and
52:41 - whatever things you guys have in your
52:43 - live chat and providing free content for
52:46 - a full year non-stop day in and day out
52:49 - every Monday at 11:00 a.m. you would get
52:52 - a video there were weeks where I was
52:53 - making seven videos a week for you guys
52:55 - without asking for a cent
53:02 - I still made time for all of those
53:05 - things right and I'm not even close to
53:09 - somebody like you know all these other
53:12 - people I'm sure they're people who are
53:14 - on this livestream who work way more
53:16 - than I do and are way way way way more
53:18 - productive but I'm just sharing from my
53:20 - personal experience that it's possible
53:24 - to make that time it's possible to have
53:28 - that time for yourself 24 hours is way
53:32 - more than enough in a day but you just
53:34 - need to be true and honest to yourself
53:36 - look yourself in the mirror and go
53:38 - exactly where you are don't lie don't
53:40 - [ __ ] yourself don't hang out with
53:42 - people who just make you feel
53:43 - comfortable because I'm telling you
53:45 - they're not your true friends they're
53:48 - just there to make you feel comfortable
53:49 - and that's it you want people who give
53:52 - you a reality check who are your cool
53:54 - friends and support you and make joke
53:56 - around and have fun but at the same time
53:58 - push you in the right direction and if
54:02 - you have that and you reverse engineer
54:04 - your way to be motivated and to be
54:06 - passionate and instead of listening to
54:08 - music you listen to books and while
54:10 - you're driving or while you're driving
54:12 - driving and when you're watching Netflix
54:14 - replacing that what learning and getting
54:17 - online trainings whether it's on more
54:19 - motivation or self-development or coding
54:23 - work on yourself alright be honest with
54:26 - yourself and you'll see yourself
54:27 - improving and trust me you don't need 24
54:30 - hours in a day 24 hours in a day is more
54:34 - than enough time to help you achieve
54:35 - your dreams alright but you just have to
54:38 - start by being honest with yourself

59:03 - Kazi is everything awesome mm-hmm
59:12 - how did you learn Django my mentor
59:15 - helped me honestly because all these
59:18 - online courses are just absolutely
59:19 - confusing and either too advanced or to
59:22 - beginner ish and more some of them are
59:25 - just all over the place so yeah my
59:27 - mentor in-person helped me and then not
59:31 - only what I learned from that mentor but
59:33 - that inspired me to refine it and create
59:36 - the system and the road map for you guys
59:38 - so now I want to share that with you
59:53 - huh Cinelli ask what will the time be on
60:04 - okay's video ended in UK I'm not sure
60:11 - the exact conversion at the top of my
60:13 - head but if you go to my webinar
60:14 - registration page so the 11 p.m. one
60:21 - will be 5 a.m. in UK and what else
60:24 - so one is 5 a.m. your time in UK and the
60:28 - other one is 6 hours ahead right I
60:30 - assume so
60:31 - it's a 11 a.m. then it should be a 5
60:34 - p.m. so one is that 5 a.m. for you in UK
60:37 - and the 1 is that 5 p.m. for you alright
60:42 - yeah and so it's the same day for them
60:45 - for UK how about India can you check
60:49 - their ten and a half hours ahead of
60:51 - Chicago time okay so 10:30 a.m. for the
61:06 - first webinar and what about the second
61:08 - time so the second time is 9:30 p.m. for
61:13 - people in India okay so 5:00 a.m. to
61:16 - 5:00 p.m. for UK those are the two times
61:19 - for India the two timings are 10:30
61:24 - should be 9:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. right
61:29 - to 10 and a half hours ahead
61:49 - all right so it's 10:30 a.m. in India
61:53 - and then the next one is 10:30 p.m. so
61:56 - those are the two times
62:02 - oh my timezone is Chicago central
62:09 - Chicago in Chicago
62:11 - so it's CST okay Central Standard Time
62:13 - so 11 a.m. in 11:00 p.m. so November
62:17 - 12th
62:18 - 11 a.m. and November 13th at 11:00 am
62:30 - too many timings sorry basically for me
62:34 - it's this Sunday night at 11 p.m. and
62:36 - then Monday morning at 11 a.m.
62:41 - awesome Constantine says I signed up it
62:44 - will be 11 a.m. for me so I'll be fresh
62:46 - and energized good
62:51 - don't put Monday and Sunday because for
62:55 - some people both of them are happening
62:56 - on Sunday for example for people in
62:58 - India it's happening the same day and
63:00 - for other people so just put the dates
63:14 - no no no no that's it no it's too
63:18 - confusing oh my god guys seriously just
63:21 - go if you can't figure it out man I
63:23 - don't know if maybe you shouldn't be
63:24 - coming to this webinar seriously go to
63:27 - the actual page we have this little we
63:30 - have this little feature okay because
63:32 - we're software developers we added this
63:34 - little feature that says convert to
63:36 - other time zones click on that and then
63:38 - it lets you convert it to your time zone
63:40 - so you can figure it out or just google
63:42 - it but yet she's got way too confusing
63:47 - the link is in the description so
63:49 - YouTube you shouldn't be doing anything
63:51 - right now you shouldn't be watching this
63:53 - video you shouldn't be waiting for me to
63:54 - say anything it's time to sign up for
63:56 - this webinar all right pause everything
63:58 - you're doing close out all the other
63:59 - tabs go sign up for this webinar on
64:02 - YouTube and Facebook go sign up for this
64:05 - webinar that's what you guys should be
64:06 - doing and then in the meantime I'll
64:08 - answer some other questions as well but
64:10 - boom boom boom sign up sign up for the
64:12 - webinar
64:33 - man I look like a legend drinking that
64:36 - calm butch up hmm all right somebody's
64:42 - complaining about answers and stuff okay
64:44 - let's see
64:53 - Marko's who says if i did not miss if
64:56 - i'm not mistaken
64:57 - since you're learning Python 16 hours a
64:59 - day for two months may I know how much
65:01 - workload you take per day so that's how
65:04 - long
65:05 - yep Renee you're right 11 sorry the
65:07 - other way 11:00 p.m. and 11:00 a.m.
65:10 - 11:00 please just click the link on the
65:14 - description is confusing the hell out of
65:16 - everybody ok
65:17 - damn alright so if I'm not mistaken
65:21 - learning Python 16 hours a day I mean I
65:24 - know how much workload you take per day
65:25 - ok so I was coding a lot every day to
65:29 - get better but it was also because I
65:31 - didn't really have that much mentoring
65:33 - you know I had one mentor who barely got
65:36 - time and then he would help put me in
65:38 - the right path and I had to just do
65:40 - pretty much everything by myself
65:42 - had I had completely like the right path
65:45 - I wouldn't need to spend very minimal
65:47 - amount of time to actually be able to do
65:49 - practical stuff that gets me jobs all
65:51 - right I'm not saying I would be a great
65:54 - coder I would just be a competent coder
65:57 - who can start actually getting practical
66:00 - work and that's a place I want to put
66:02 - you out so especially with my course I
66:05 - want to set you up to a point where and
66:08 - take you beyond this point as well but
66:10 - what I want to do for you is get you to
66:12 - the point where you're learning basics
66:14 - and practical things at the same time so
66:16 - you're ready to get your first client
66:18 - and from there you start actually
66:20 - improving your coding skills - and I'll
66:22 - show you what you need to be doing -
66:24 - constantly improving your coding skills
66:25 - but the first most important thing is
66:27 - having a portfolio having projects in
66:30 - that portfolio and being able to show
66:32 - your clients that and knowing those
66:33 - practical skills then you can actually
66:35 - land those clients and make that money
66:37 - and get that paycheck after that if you
66:39 - want to get really good you want to
66:41 - learn about recursive Fibonacci
66:42 - solutions or you know do all these crazy
66:45 - problems on project oil or hacker rank
66:47 - or wherever else then you can do them on
66:51 - your own time ok but instead of before
66:53 - getting into the all the nerdy
66:54 - nitty-gritty I want to give you the
66:56 - practical stuff show you how to get
66:58 - clients start making money so you can
67:00 - relax breathe eat and then you can
67:03 - become a nerd
67:04 - trust me I love nothing more than
67:06 - nerding out when it comes to coding all
67:13 - right all right all right
67:26 - Marcus coos laughing okay fish says I've
67:31 - signed up for tomorrow good awesome
67:34 - awesome
67:35 - yeah move to California man I don't know
67:37 - what you're doing in Kansas California
67:39 - is awesome
67:45 - yeah the website I don't know what you
67:48 - mean by it's designed for US and
67:49 - Canadian citizens only Oh like the time
67:53 - yeah it is but yeah just convert it to
67:57 - your own times guys I'm sorry I'll try
67:59 - to add more times but there's no good
68:02 - way to do it without just adding a
68:04 - massive amount of information on there
68:06 - and confusing everybody
68:07 - so I try to put simple things I try to
68:09 - tell you it's est and then I have the
68:11 - feature to say convert to other time
68:13 - zones or you can go on your own just
68:15 - google it and hit convert to other time
68:18 - zones
68:19 - Dovie says signed up I'm pumped love all
68:22 - your efforts get pumped this webinar has
68:25 - a potential to change your life so I'm
68:27 - gonna say this on the webinar as well
68:29 - but when you come here we're not
68:31 - screwing around you have your phone off
68:34 - or on Do Not Disturb all right you have
68:37 - your other tabs closed and bring
68:41 - something to write with you okay so I
68:43 - have I bring a legal pad all right I
68:45 - have a legal pad where I write it I just
68:48 - stuff into my brain like nothing else
68:50 - so bring something to write with you pen
68:52 - and paper or if not maybe just write it
68:55 - on your laptop but be and do not disturb
68:58 - mode and yeah because this stuff has the
69:01 - potential to change your life it has
69:03 - taken me years to put all of this stuff
69:05 - together for you so make sure you show
69:08 - up and and just get as much value as you
69:11 - can and it's free okay
69:25 - awesome awesome would you say it would
69:32 - be hard for a foreigner to get a job in
69:34 - USA with web development that's a
69:36 - question I get a lot and I've been
69:39 - getting this question a lot from people
69:41 - in India so all my students were in
69:43 - India guys it's no different than
69:47 - getting a job from while you're in US
69:49 - okay getting clients is the same process
69:52 - you can get clients for in United States
69:54 - and UK or wherever else and I show you
69:57 - that in the course so don't be worried
70:00 - about if you're in a specific place
70:02 - you're limited to some kind of you know
70:05 - lower money or whatever okay or you're
70:08 - not gonna get as much work or you have
70:10 - to be stuck with a specific programming
70:12 - language don't worry about that it's the
70:15 - same way and it works everywhere the
70:17 - same way all right and that's the beauty
70:19 - of being a developer because you can
70:21 - work remotely and most of the companies
70:22 - now choose to work remotely
70:31 - Dovie Glassman says man I'm confused is
70:34 - it free or not the webinar the webinar
70:41 - is free the course isn't it's a paid
70:44 - course but the webinar is free so show
70:47 - up to it and get massive value out of it
70:53 - let's see The Drifter somebody's asking
70:56 - me the question last time
71:05 - all right so draft drifter asks hmm I
71:09 - have I misunderstood something or what
71:11 - do you get when you enroll to the VIP
71:13 - waiting list for the 90 days client
71:17 - course doesn't that mean it's free what
71:21 - you get for getting on the VIP waiting
71:24 - list first of all you get my bonus for
71:27 - how I became a software developer in
71:29 - less than three months so you get that
71:30 - bonus video that's one the second thing
71:33 - you get is it says you'll be notified as
71:35 - soon as the course is open so one way to
71:38 - get notified is on live streams which is
71:40 - great that you're here but let's say you
71:41 - weren't here you would still be getting
71:43 - those emails for when the course is open
71:46 - and I would be making sure that you
71:48 - don't miss out on it all right so though
71:50 - that would be the big benefit of signing
71:52 - up for the VIP waitlist but right now
71:56 - there is no VIP waitlist because the
71:59 - course is opening up in just a few days
72:01 - alright so the time is here the time is
72:04 - now keep in mind once the course opens
72:07 - it only has five days until we take
72:10 - students and after that it's over all
72:13 - right there's no more new enrollments
72:15 - even though you have lifetime access to
72:18 - the course but it's kind of like a
72:22 - college class once everybody enters I
72:24 - don't want to focus on getting new
72:26 - students in I want to take that group of
72:28 - students and make them as badass and
72:30 - more as skilled and getting them jobs
72:32 - and getting them those practical skills
72:34 - as possible okay so I'm gonna kind of
72:36 - maximize what we do with that group of
72:39 - students who gets inside within those
72:41 - that those five days and if you come to
72:44 - the webinar I'll break down everything
72:46 - about the course exactly what you will
72:48 - be getting in the course I'll break down
72:50 - what we've covered in the profitable
72:52 - program or masterclass and we'll also
72:54 - have a Q&A section so we take your
72:57 - questions and answer them alright draft
73:04 - drifters Jesus these guys were teaming
73:07 - up Marcus cool and draft drifter love it
73:12 - love it love it love it signed up and
73:16 - bookmarked wife should be
73:18 - we're hit that time so I can pay full
73:20 - attention good job send your wife on a
73:22 - massage you know send her somewhere pay
73:26 - $70 for a nice massage where she could
73:28 - go and get it and in that time you could
73:30 - focus in on the video whatever it takes
73:32 - to focus on the video okay and the girls
73:35 - and the wives in here
73:36 - send your husbands and your boyfriend
73:38 - somewhere and be here be with us be with
73:42 - the clever programmer community and we
73:44 - just really have amazing life-changing
73:46 - stuff for you guys I mean I don't know
73:47 - how else to put it
73:48 - mmm okay let's see
73:52 - Renee is saying she does bunch of
73:59 - questions so let me see she said you
74:06 - should use government funding to offer
74:08 - it for free I use it to oversee u.s. MVM
74:12 - FG recruiting for a major energy company
74:16 - vocational schools or where it's at
74:18 - Jesus that's just scary to me and I
74:20 - don't even know what that means but
74:22 - Renee is not somebody I want to mess
74:23 - with it's basically a boot camp right
74:26 - but better less cumbersome the idea of
74:29 - this boot camp essentially or this
74:32 - course is I was realizing too many
74:36 - people had jobs too many people had kids
74:38 - too many people had already other other
74:42 - things that they needed to be doing
74:44 - other commitments so this course I
74:46 - designed it in a way where it's just
74:48 - hyper massively practical that's not a
74:53 - word but I just made it up
74:54 - and it's just insanely practical so
74:58 - meaning even if you can spend a few
75:00 - hours in a week and do the things that I
75:03 - outlined you will get results again I
75:06 - want to keep all the people away who
75:08 - think this is gonna be easy and they're
75:10 - just gonna come in and get all these
75:11 - results without putting in work guys
75:13 - it's not that so if that's what you're
75:15 - thinking don't even bother showing up to
75:17 - the webinar I'm just gonna say that
75:18 - right now but if you follow all those
75:22 - things right
75:23 - you've only are looking to spend a few
75:25 - hours in a week so I wanted to make sure
75:27 - that it's for somebody who can use
75:29 - Python for side hustling or freelancing
75:32 - or trying to get a job full-time all
75:41 - right patty Pugh says yeah I have to
75:47 - kick my fiance off the computer I
75:49 - usually watch you on my phone yeah this
75:51 - one it's ok fiance take the El on this
75:55 - one but you're gonna take many double
75:57 - use later other than that Winston says
76:03 - so will there only be five days to
76:05 - register for the course absolutely 5
76:08 - days only then the enrollments are
76:10 - closed so keep in mind I've only opened
76:12 - this course up twice in one year I
76:14 - opened this up sometime in April the
76:16 - first time for five days then I shut it
76:19 - down then I hope those students get
76:21 - results then in June we had a team at
76:25 - clever programmer so we had more people
76:28 - than just me working at clever
76:29 - programmer so we opened the course in
76:32 - June and we closed it and we got lots of
76:34 - students and then we helped lots of
76:36 - students get results because also we
76:38 - didn't had a bigger team now our team is
76:40 - even bigger and we're ready to help you
76:43 - crush it even more this time so this is
76:45 - our third time launching it after about
76:47 - four or five months and it's only going
76:50 - to be open for five days and after that
76:52 - we closed it down and the next time
76:54 - we're gonna be opening it won't be any
76:56 - earlier than four to five months okay
77:02 - all right guys thank you so much for
77:04 - coming other I keep looking at the
77:06 - questions you guys questions are awesome
77:07 - and I'm just gonna keep answering them
77:09 - thank you thank you thank you hi Maryam
77:11 - hello thank you guys for coming so much
77:12 - as always I love your faces off thank
77:16 - you and at this point we're well over
77:20 - the 1 hour mark but I want to be here
77:22 - for you guys so that's it thank you guys
77:24 - so much I love your face off and YouTube
77:26 - I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hi YouTube hey guys what is up how's it going this sis Kazi from clever programmer comm we finally figured out how to go live we had our computers crashing we have to like change the laptops we had to like get a new like install all these software but that's good hopefully we got it we're about 1 or 2 minute pastor a time but other than that it should be good in this livestream we will be helping you level up your Python from zero to your first paycheck so if you're a complete beginner you're in the right place if you're intermediate you're in the right place and if you're somebody who's even more advanced but doesn't know how to get that cash and get those clients for your skill set you are in the right place how is everybody doing today so I'm asking you Instagram I'm asking you Facebook and I'm asking you YouTube how is everybody doing ya know for now and just enjoy but tomorrow we're gonna the course is gonna be launching tomorrow at like midnight Chicago time and if if you're in India or something will be earlier thank you thank you since Instagram likes to hear me gulp I got some kombucha I got some kombucha today guys on YouTube if you guys want to check this out it's really good energy I don't even know how do you define this thing here's what it says on it renew rebalance rebuild reclaim rekindle and recharge hopefully that gives you guys something on this but of how I liked it but it just gives me a lot of energy and it's weird it doesn't even have caffeine or anything but I like it so whatever alright okay it sounds like everybody is doing good people are like nice haircut Kazi awesome Diane Jones is like I make my own kombucha awesome if you make your own feel free to send it out to us just look up clever programmer on instagram we have our office address feel free to send us a shipment of kombucha and we would love it oh there are some people that are getting confused this is not the actual big webinar okay this is a live stream where we're gonna I'm gonna tell you what the webinar is about and I'm also gonna take on your questions like question and answer so this is a lot of oneonone interaction you guys will get with me today Instagram Facebook YouTube and then the live webinar goes tomorrow at 11 p.m. so tomorrow at midnight almost 11 p.m. is the first showing and the second showing so there's one showing it's Sunday night 11 p.m. and then the second one where I go live is Monday morning at 11 a.m. yeah this guy's this webinar is gonna be really really cool spent a lot of time putting it together and I'm gonna be there live we already have how many people do we have registered so far yeah we have almost 2,500 people registered for this webinar just to put it into perspective the last time I think we did a webinar a really big webinar we had about like 700 people I think like 700 people registered and we're right now two days away from the webinar so we still have two solid days to go so with 2500 people I expect about three four thousand people to register and then that's it so it's pretty much one day one day and like 15 hours left to sign up and so yeah I recommend that if you guys are here the link is in the description bio on Instagram Facebook the link is at the bottom and go and check it out alright go sign up to it and show up to it I'll answer your questions there as well and in that webinar what you guys are gonna be getting is you know there there was part one of my video I launched the profitable programmer masterclass and so it had part one where we found out your Python earning potential and we found out like what the job market is for Python developers we figured out your lifestyle and then in the second one we figured it out why most programmers or write too many programmers are broke and how you can avoid it and in the third one what did we talk about Mustafar oh yeah he's making a cigar story cool so yeah if you guys are following us on instagram if you see Instagram story some of it is me some of it as my friend must have fought but in the third one we go a lot deeper into giving you the Python client getting system so I give you how to get clients and what's a fullon roadmap from getting a client attracted to you all the way to not only getting your money but putting that testimonial on your portfolio so in the webinar if you missed all three of those videos that were epic and you shouldn't have missed them but if you've missed them on the webinar we're gonna have we're gonna cover kind of all those videos in a short time we're gonna cover what they were about the most important points oh yeah and in the second video also you hand you a portfolio as well and then after that I'm gonna talk about my new course and my new course launches tomorrow or actually in two days but tomorrow I'm gonna be talking about my course on the webinar as well okay and taking your guys's questions so right now I will take on your guys's questions and then we'll go from there hi hope for all oh yeah the other day what I did on Instagram was I went live on Instagram and then I just you can apparently go live with other people on Instagram and so what I did is I just went live with a bunch of people so there was I talked to pre Nam I talked to Oprah all I talked to to other people their names are slipping me but yeah I just went live with them and then what Instagram does is it splits the screen in half for both of you and you're live and you're interviewing you're talking with them and everybody else in the audience can hear you so I'm answering your questions live it's a really cool feature and also Instagram was built off of what who knows what Instagram was built off of what programming language was used my friend here is raising his hand if you guys know type it in in the comments all right uh crew Todd Patel crew ptarth yes the varam says both Sunday and Monday webinars covers same topics on two different timings or two different days yes they're both they're just different timings but they cover the same main topic since I'm live I don't know what kind of crazy should I'm saying on either of the webinar knowing me I'm always like I'll go on these crazy tangents and these like deep thoughts so if you miss one or the other I don't know there might be some material that you miss but the main topic will be there okay so the main thing you won't miss if you join wear it one or the other okay cool we have a lot of people saying Python so it looks like these people know the power of Python that's really good yep Instagram is made off of Python and that's what we were using to go livestream with them um let me ask you guys some simple Python questions let's see where your guys are at and it's okay if you guys are completely at level zero or never written a line of code before because again that's what I'm here to help you with and my course is here to help you whether you're at zero intermediate or maybe even advanced because we had advanced web developer and her name is aframe she she's awesome she was on we did an interview with her and she saved her company over twenty three thousand dollars with Python after taking my course so even if you're experienced you could still get a lot of value out of it now let me ask you guys some Python questions let's see if you have to put a bunch of things all right somewhere what data type would you use okay so let's say is just like a bunch of student names and it's Bob and Billy and John and dadadada the list of student goes on what data type would you use to store that information okay just a simple question all right Sam good job Sam you got it yeah Sam is is in my in my course so I'm not but Sam I'm disappointed that you're saying the word irate because that's a more java word but other but no your idea is right okay cool cool cool cool so most of the people said Nicholas says in a notepad no but in Python what data type to be used so that's funny yes everybody who says list good job and the list look like those brackets okay so it's like how am i imagine list to be is like a bucket and you just throw a bunch of things in there I have this plastic bag here so you can just imagine a list to be like this plastic bag and I take my infamous Mike you guys know this Mike and I just take it and boom I take my kombucha and I throw it in there boom this paper bag in Python we call it a list all right we call it a list now when I put things in this bag when I put this when I put this in a bag does the back here about the order of it like meaning if I put a lot of things in here and then I go back and look in this bag is it really easy for me to take out the things in the same order as I put them in oh and everybody who says we're a good job array is the right answer as well there's just different way of calling it okay yeah okay so we're getting a lot of people saying we got somebody on Facebook saying no Matt MEC says not unless you remember the order on Instagram and then we have people on YouTube saying no and nope and no Adi Bakar Bukhari Deathwish and Keon hope yeah so you guys are right there is no way to know the order maybe unless you remember it but it's too complicated like a plastic bag doesn't care about the order so a list though in Python remembers the order you put things in okay so imagine if this plastic bag had a way of telling you which thing was on position one which thing was on position two and which thing was on position three okay it remembers the order now can you guys think of where we would use something like lists in real life like let's say fate like on Facebook or Instagram or you know some some website that we all use where do you think you could give me an example of where a list is used in Python okay Justin says friends list on Facebook that's really good example Spotify to arrange the songs that's a really good example Sam kyon hope I butchered your name I'm sorry I'm sorry such as our life my name always gets messed up unfortunately friends list some people are saying storing names shopping listing and ecommerce storing contacts storing data keeping track of book index friends list on Facebook names phone numbers emails okay what you post on your timeline on Facebook very good student profile okay good good you guys are now getting the idea okay yes like images yes good good good so on on platforms okay again if you guys have something to write would you write this [ __ ] down this is exciting okay so you know exactly where a lot of these things are used so then when you're learning about it in Python it's not just boring and it's like I'm just learning about list a datatype structure it has more context and it's more fun so okay so let's take something like a list right and on Instagram you could use it to store images now if you put things in a list it's not like a paper bag right because in paper bag you don't remember what order you used but list remembers to order now the order is important because if I go on my Instagram I want to make sure that my recent pictures are at the top and my oldest pictures are all them at the bottom where else does order matter when I go on Facebook and I look at everything on somebody's Facebook wall I want to see the recent Facebook post at the top and everything else at the bottom right the oldest Facebook post where else is order important when I order when I was put things into my shopping cart I want them to be in the right order or when I review my recent orders on Amazon and see everything that bought I want to go down the list like boom boom boom boom boom and see which thing was purchased when you know what's the time of it so those are some examples in real life wirless reviews now how about Netflix okay we have all these movies we got to store them somewhere so maybe we could use a list for that okay so always be thinking about this however in somewhere like Netflix we don't necessarily care about the order that much okay so maybe my gain is a little bit low iPhone storage full all right let's see hello hello hello um how is the audio doing on YouTube are you guys able to hear me clearly or is it a little low yeah what Steph says I love Netflix yeah what's up bro how's it going tenzin just joined my live stream on instagram it's my good friend what about creating an MVP for your company mmhmm sorting good Bharath seems like it seems like Bharat Bharat knows a thing or two about what we're talking about okay we have somebody asking for different books so I'm gonna give you guys a book okay don't go anywhere hold up a second all right don't freak out I'm right here got a book this is a book recommendation I have used this book to learn Python and this is a book I'd like to recommend to people so for the people who are asking for a book here you go that's hilarious so Tenzin just said just at Walmart doing grocery my grocery list doesn't care about order it's a little yeah so your grocery list doesn't care about ordering doesn't need to if it had to care about order it would just be inefficient and because it ultimately wouldn't matter so yeah there are other good books out there like learn Python the hard way what I most love about you Kazi it's your mic god Paulo broke my heart okay say it's clear what about learning Python the hard way yep luck [ __ ] that is a good book I am a fan of this to be honest because it goes through like building actual projects I mean learn Python the hard way does as well but I'm a fan of I don't know I'm just a fan of this you created these games and stuff and I like it you know I kind of nerd out on this book a little bit you create like tennis simulations and here's just a rule of thumb with books I talked with my good friend Ben marks he works at Google and he writes code and Python every single day and he was telling me that when you are using Python or sorry when you are learning coding and you're trying to learn it from a book one of the best things to do is just go to a book with a lot of exercise and my friend um Jude said the same thing okay um Jude is one of the founding engineers at code Academy and if any of you guys have used repple it or have seen me use droplet repl i.t um Jude was the founder of it okay so um Jude also says find books that just have a lot of exercises in them so if you're gonna get a Python or coding book just pick it up and just go through it and just see how many exercises it has and if it looks like you're working on a lot of handson exercises and projects then you're in a good place the author of this book is john's l jo hn ze ll e john's l ha was ml hi how are you doing man how's it going I love the way you speak English so much it's easy to understand you're the first speaker I can understand what you say without using subtitles beautiful um yes I I sound sometimes crazy in real life trying to enunciate every word so clearly but hopefully it comes off clear to you guys and you guys understand it well so thank you for letting me know that and that helps me try to just focus on speaking clearly more um you could get the book from Amazon somebody just asked where do people get the book from you can go on Amazon and get it or I don't know if you have some coding stores nearby I it's such a thing exists the coding stores if it doesn't then we got to open it I mean guys after this course launch is over we're gonna be trying to open up a coding store near you yeah Graham you know it grinding on a Saturday night got a date coming up soon but whatever you know it's its grind time baby you guys are more important get it from PDF okay I want to learn how to code but all the courses are in other languages any suggestions Python is awesome again my course is gonna be opening up soon so if you are excited about it you want to find out more about it how the course works what it covers what kind of practical applications we'll be building how I'll be showing you where to go and get your clients how I'll be showing you how to land those clients how I'll be giving you the exact roadmap to become a developer in 90 days it's hard work it's hard work don't get me wrong if you think this is like oh I'm just gonna go there and it's just all gonna work and I'm just gonna make money it's just gonna shower on me that's not gonna happen but if you follow the roadmap and you work on the things that I'm laying out for you since we're gonna be learning and building practical stuff at the same time by the end you're gonna be ready to get that job so if you're interested make sure to show your face on that webinar alright the link is in the description below I'm gonna take out take a little time out and have you guys register for that webinar because that webinar is awesome it's called level up your Python from zero to your first paycheck I want to get all of you guys in there and give you all this mindblowing content there's something you don't want to miss out so on YouTube once you sign up you know type in one Instagram once you sign up for this webinar the link is in the bio type in one or say I signed up and same thing goes for you Facebook once you sign up say that you have signed up that's hilarious some people would like to learn for their own company purposes while I'm asking hold on what was your question maybe I missed it hi marriage how are you doing hamish body yay haha Jesus yeah the whole family's here that's awesome are there any iTunes U courses you would recommend unfortunately I never took any coding course on iTunes U but I can recommend you a podcast it's called slipping my mind programming throwdown I used to listen to that all the time in when I was going to college and I would be taking the train and I would be like I would have my headsets and be listening to programming throwdown they talk about like and advanced stuff and some of it is not even relevant but I just enjoy it a lot I know my friend Tenzin he hates it and he hated me for recommending it to him but I don't know Mike out on that and I enjoy it okay cool Azim says I've signed up good good good good we got a bunch of people saying 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 good good good what kind of skill is required everybody wants to know the price of the course that's I'm also gonna tell you guys the price of the course it hasn't been finalized but if you're on the webinar you will find out okay everybody on the webinar you will find out what level of skill is required if you're talking about the course you can be at zero skill never even Thank You Renee that's awesome thank you for writing that but yeah if you even have zero skills you're good one and a half day he'll have too much time ugh [ __ ] yeah I know you're excited buddy but don't worry that time is almost here and we're gonna be launching it soon and so at this point guys if you're here sign up for that webinar once you're done signing up for the webinar make sure to go and put it in your calendar I've even set up and this was a pain I had to literally make an account on Twilio and go through all this other stuff but I I made it so you guys even get like text reminders so make sure that you know you put in all that stuff in the webinar when you're registering and then put in your phone number as well and then I'll personally send out a text to you so that you can get a reminder before it starts the webinar you don't need any skill level to come to the webinar you can have zero coding skills even if you're more intermediate or advanced that's totally okay we're not we're not coding in the webinar all right let me see best website to learn Django there are a couple of good resources for Django one of them being one of my good friends Justin Mitchell from coding for entrepreneurs and he has a lot of stuff on Django and he also has a YouTube channel on Django in this course we're gonna be covering a lot of Django so yeah I think this will be the best Jenga course available we'll be going we're and but in this course we're not just covering a framework we're covering like how to actually do web development with Python so while specific frameworks are important I'm gonna be showing you guys how to become a good web developer and then I'll help you choose your specific framework so we'll have some stuff in a framework like flask and then we'll have some stuff in a framework like Django awesome we got a lot of people signing up for the webinar great how many people do we have now registered for the webinar good job somebody else just registered awesome it's good to know let me actually or actually hold on oh no I don't have my phone thank you thank you thank you let me let me get that bad boy let's see let's see here what is going on okay okay sweet so we are about to hit the 2500 registrants mark that's good so if you guys have signed up good job awesome I even have a special video that I'm gonna be making for you guys that you people who registered on the webinar are gonna get no no I'm not cool and then for everybody else if you haven't registered go register and yeah and if you send this out a cool email or something will try to read it live on the webinar yeah we got lots of comments on that profitable programmer master class we hit like over a thousand comments we had about 20,000 plus people watch watch right at about 20,000 plus people go through the profitable programmer master class yeah that was insane that happened last week so if you guys missed it not a problem if you come to the webinar we will be touching on those you won't the whole thing isn't gonna be there but we'll be touching on the most important and meaty things from that because I know a lot of you might not have that much time a lot of you might be busy so that's gonna be your best chance now let me ask you guys another let's do another Python question should we do another Python question all right first of all let's do that should we do another Python question for you guys yeah seem knowing knowing Opie's good ok it's still hard to hear right ok um I just moved the gain up a little bit more do you want to have like a headset in or something so you can hear it I don't know if you're gonna get do you think you're gonna get feedback from this no like the annoying feedback okay yeah check it out all right cool so let's so let's do this okay so what about if you need to store information and again guys these questions are basic and even if you don't know them that's totally fine but it's starting good to start thinking about this stuff so let's say that you have you know where what kind of data type in Python would you use to store let's say names and then phone numbers that go with them okay so you have name and then you have a phone number then you have another name and then you have another phone number so then when you later want to look it up you can just try to look up the name and they'll give you the phone number that's associated with it so what kind of bucket in Python would you throw that into and in a little bit I'll make it a multiple choice so for those of you guys who totally have no idea that's okay you'll find out somebody's had sequel hold on you're getting a little advanced and we are talking about Python right now okay cool so we actually have a bunch of people who know about this datatype awesome awesome so we have somebody saying dictionary array is not the right answer Muhammad list is close but it's not list so it's either between lists and dictionaries and since I just said it's not list obviously it's not list so yeah everybody who said dictionary good job okay not a big deal if you didn't know this one but dictionaries where you can just put a key we call it four and that's your in our case we'll put the key as a name make the key whatever something that's easy to remember so we'll put name as the key and the value get out of it as a phone number now on Netflix on Netflix the key would be the name of the movie and the value might be the actual movie itself okay can you guys give me some realworld examples of a dictionary of a key and a value maybe it's I don't know in groceries store you found it maybe on Amazon maybe on Instagram maybe on something else can you give me an example of where we might use dictionary in real world student number spotify everywhere walmart price list I have no idea some people are saying some people are saying snapchat let's see username and passwords okay good registration and login that's another good one okay so that's a good way to think about it your username is a key and your password is the value all right phone contacts same thing the name is the key and the phone number is a value so if you go down the list and then other things in real life if you look up a specific order and you click on it maybe the price is the value okay so in real world we have lists and dictionaries being used all around us even though sometimes when you're coding and they're teaching you about data types like lists and dictionaries you can't relate you're like what how are we using this in real world so it's important whenever you're learning something have that you know that context in mind you know have the real context of why you're doing this and how this could be helpful to you and for dictionaries the symbol is like this okay in Python I'm just gonna type that in for you guys so it's kind of like a squiggly squiggly thing yep good job Sri SRI's EV MJ Saudagar pricelist azim says student ID good bus ticket good job yep curly braket good what does that joke how does it go why do Java developers wear glasses who knows this one why do Java developers wear glasses man this kombucha is good did you look this up huh nobody on Facebook got it ah okay we got first person on Instagram who got it good we got somebody on Instagram who got it as well another person to see the brackets good andreas got it Muhammad Farhan got it good Ibrahim got it Grundy got it as well good yep it's because they can't see sharp mmhmm Java is hard I mean don't get me wrong all these languages are good and pop and useful and powerful right but my biggest problems come with don't care somebody starting out and they're learning why to do something like print hello world the easiest thing on the planet you have to make a class and you have to compile and you have to learn how to use the terminal and there's not a good place to just run it in the browser like what's up with that that's my problem when it comes to languages like Java C C++ and all these other languages they're great but why did they make it so hard like javascript for example makes your life pretty easy you could go in your Chrome right now and run JavaScript and boom you're running it and then Python is the same way you can go to a simple website like repple it and there's a terminal and you get instant feedback and you can be running your code ok you could go into your command line and most of the most of mac books or most every Apple product every Apple computer already comes with Python installed and then on windows installing it takes like 2 seconds so even if you want to run it locally and you don't need to make a class you don't need to make you don't need to know how this whole commandline things work you'd pretty much don't need to know anything you can run the code right away cool all right let me take some of your guys's questions Stefan says hey man I have a question for you I really want to learn programming and I really started once but I lost my passion and motivation for for it does that mean I'm not for it or what you're gonna lose passion and motivation and then it's gonna come back it's it's like like I'm Jude said a sine wave it's a horrible way to describe it only people who do math or know anything about math will get it but it's like waves you know you'll get really motivated and you'll be like yeah motivated and then you start going down and then all of a sudden you feel motivated and passionate again and then it goes down it comes in cycles but motivation can be reversed engineered so motivation and passion is not what you guys think it is it's not this random thing that happens by luck all of it could actually be reversed engineered and you could turn into a system and make yourself be motivated and passionate so for example as human beings we are really dumb okay we are really really really really stupid as human beings here's what that means whatever is happening around us influences us and what you think are your thoughts aren't actually not your thoughts at all these are thoughts that you have based on the environment that you're in the people that you're around the media that you're consuming that's what is that's what those thoughts are actually comprised of they're not your own they're just a mixture of all these and that unique combination that gets marinated that's inside your head that's what you think is the unique you and are your thoughts now knowing that we could be really depressed that we are really stupid or knowing that be really happy because we could reverseengineer it a lot of things in our life so for example if I feel less passionate or motivated when I'm driving I don't listen to music because it's a waste of time listening to music it's sometimes good if you're using it to get yourself palmtree of working on something to get yourself focus but if you're driving it's just a waste of time why not listen to books on something like audible why not when you're in a train and you got your headsets in or you're doing a commute listen to books and you could listen to books that motivate you or talk about coding or programming that's one thing you could do here's another amazing crazy hack that's lifechanging when you are at home and you're about to eat your food why waste all that time just sitting there eating food looking at a wall or what do some of us do we eat food while watching house of cards while watching stranger things or suits or I don't know whatever news channels or cat videos or just you stuff on YouTube or surfing the internet whatever it may be for you instead of doing that why not watch cool stuff you could be building with code or maybe there's a new problem in coding that you've hit and now you're stuck so you're looking up how to solve it or you're looking at coding tutorials and you're eating food and looking at that at the same time alright so if you replace your car time and all that other nonsense just release your music with stuff about coding and you're watching stuff about coding and coming up with new ideas those are the easiest hacks so you can start implementing right now or also you could go to local meetups where there are other people who think about coding who dream about coding who love it and want to build amazing things now this is something important to you and you start applying all three of these things I just told you you know changing the circle of your friends because you know they say the five friends around you right the five closest people to you you're not only just the average of them but quantifiably that it's actually measurable and your average salary is also the average of the five people around you and how much they make okay so for those of you who like to think very objectively like me even if you don't believe that other whole thing about you're the average of the five closest people to you if you look around what their salaries are and you see what your salary is you're like whoa we're all really close that should be you know that should tell you something so if those people are not about coding or not passionate about their life or not trying to reach their goals or not trying to move themselves forward or not motivated and not motivating you and not believing in you maybe just maybe it's time to expand that inner circle to other people and those people who don't care for you or are there for you to make yourself feel comfortable but don't really push you or challenge you or move you to do new things maybe just maybe it's time to cut them out all right so you combine replacing music with books you combine or placing Netflix and the stupid [ __ ] you watch and you waste your time an average American spends 40 hours a week and my phone just died so my live stream is dead let's figure out what's going on with this bad boy but think about this okay average American spends 40 hours a week on TV so most of us complain about not having time we have time we just spend it on a lot of weird things and I'm not putting myself above it I do it all the time that's why I have these things in the back of my head because while I am teaching you and sharing this with you I'm mostly getting the most benefit for myself because it reminds me to do these things because I'm the one also who's not spending time doing the right things so if we can our habits we can reverse engineer being motivated and passionate and being at that level that we want to be at and we don't have to condemn ourselves anymore for not having that passion or that motivation hopefully that answers your question okay so somebody so he just said um you have a wife and she needs time to and of course she does but also keep in mind people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people like Grant Cardone also have a wife but they're run like multiple businesses there are multi millionaires they change the lives of millions of people they work nonstop yet they still find the time to keep up with their health they still spend quality time with their children and to still spend quality time with their family so don't lie to yourself that you don't have time I'm not gonna lie to myself that I don't have time we mess up but we just need to be honest with why we're making those mistakes okay that's where your real change is gonna come from if you can't look at yourself in the mirror and be honest with yourself don't expect anybody else to change your life I can't change your life that person next you can't change your life and if you're not gonna be honest with yourself you can't change your life either so start from there start from being honest with yourself exactly where you are in your relationship in your career in your life your friends near you right you're a girlfriend boyfriend your wife husband whatever start there and just go through the list and see what level each of those things are at are you happy making the money or making every year are you happy being able to just go from paycheck to paycheck are you happy doing things in a way that's average where you know you could be doing better if you're not then there are things that need to change and to start that change you need to start by being honest with yourself okay because if you make excuses and if you let yourself off the hook and you say things like oh but I have this too so that needs time too while that is true you have those 24 hours if you juice them and you melt them you can get a lot done alright you can get a lot done like I'm gonna tell you from my personal experience and I'm not amazing or anything I am you know I was a dumb college kid and now I'm just a kid who's trying to run clever programmer and make sure you guys get massive value out of it but when I was building clever programmer you know this is the fastest channel to go from zero to a hundred thousand subscribers for coding ever how did that happen was was there magic involved no I was spending like hundreds of hours a week I was still spending time with my family I still kept up with my friends you guys still see my friends in my Instagram Facebook stories on snapchat and even on YouTube and even on my live streams from time to time I still kept up with my family I still kept up with my friends I still had a job I was doing I was a coaching students for programming and chess and video editing and all kinds of stuff and students from 20 years of age to 60 years of age students who were going to kindergarten to students who were 45 years old and doing their PhD program for analytics and needed to use Python for machine learning I was also playing chess competitively at the time and going to tournaments I was also going to ping pong tournaments at the same time I was building this channel like a maniac okay I was also in a relationship at that time I was also going to the gym I was also getting really good sleep and now we have a fullon company what started as a dream just a hope and dream and aspirations and I was like maybe you know one day people will look at this and get value out of it maybe clever programmer will be able to provide value to other people maybe I can help somebody who's not just me and a lot of these things that I learned I can share this with other people because I was I don't want to hold this to myself because I thought what's the point of being alive if you can't provide value to others and if others don't know about you and what started as a dream a year ago right now we have hundreds of thousands of students on our YouTube we have millions of people of viewers on YouTube we have a lot of people on an Instagram Facebook and we have over hundreds hundreds of thousands of students who've went through our coding courses and people have gotten jobs people have gone promoted at their work people have gone internships for you know as Python Django people have who are web developers have saved their company over twenty three thousand dollars people have become Python web developers and now even have clients people have done things there was a person who was a freelancer CG generalist and after taking my course he was able to do something that was taking the other team in Brazil seven days to do he was able to automate it with Python in four hours and made $1,200 all right so all of this stuff happening and getting people results and making sure to be there with my students and always being there with you guys and listening to you guys and responding to your emails and your comments and whatever things you guys have in your live chat and providing free content for a full year nonstop day in and day out every Monday at 1100 a.m. you would get a video there were weeks where I was making seven videos a week for you guys without asking for a cent I still made time for all of those things right and I'm not even close to somebody like you know all these other people I'm sure they're people who are on this livestream who work way more than I do and are way way way way more productive but I'm just sharing from my personal experience that it's possible to make that time it's possible to have that time for yourself 24 hours is way more than enough in a day but you just need to be true and honest to yourself look yourself in the mirror and go exactly where you are don't lie don't [ __ ] yourself don't hang out with people who just make you feel comfortable because I'm telling you they're not your true friends they're just there to make you feel comfortable and that's it you want people who give you a reality check who are your cool friends and support you and make joke around and have fun but at the same time push you in the right direction and if you have that and you reverse engineer your way to be motivated and to be passionate and instead of listening to music you listen to books and while you're driving or while you're driving driving and when you're watching Netflix replacing that what learning and getting online trainings whether it's on more motivation or selfdevelopment or coding work on yourself alright be honest with yourself and you'll see yourself improving and trust me you don't need 24 hours in a day 24 hours in a day is more than enough time to help you achieve your dreams alright but you just have to start by being honest with yourself my left here is really enjoying this is it coming out of only one year you heard in both yours right okay um guys at this point you know if you're here listen link is in the bio on Instagram link is in the description on YouTube go and sign up for this webinar this will be lifechanging stuff I'm serious with you right

me know that you've signed up yeah and same thing goes for you guys on Facebook all right Dovie says have you seen the book called automate the boring stuff do you think it's a good book for Python yes I think that's a good book for Python Patti Pugh does she have a question um no there will be a replay yes but it won't be the exact webinar replay it'll be different and all the bonuses oh I forgot to tell you guys for everybody who registers on this webinar there will be a person who gets the entire course for free ok make sure to put that in the chat so they can see it but one of the people on this webinar will get the entire course for free ok this is gonna be my new course I'm even gonna reveal the name you got the route I'm gonna reveal the name on the webinar nobody knows the name of this course yet so we've only been using a pseudonym but the real name is gonna be revealed on the webinar also I have some special bonuses for people on the webinar only this bonus these few bonuses you'll only get if you are on the webinar all right and I'm gonna give you a hint on one of the bonuses this is the bonus that helped me land my first client with Python in less than 90 days and the same client who paid me twenty thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents for less than two months of work I'm gonna and that's what this bonus is related to and that's just one of the bonuses there are other bonuses that you're gonna get if you come to this live webinar so make sure to sign up cuz there's gonna be a lot of valuable things you're gonna be getting Kazi is everything awesome mmhmm how did you learn Django my mentor helped me honestly because all these online courses are just absolutely confusing and either too advanced or to beginner ish and more some of them are just all over the place so yeah my mentor inperson helped me and then not only what I learned from that mentor but that inspired me to refine it and create the system and the road map for you guys so now I want to share that with you huh Cinelli ask what will the time be on okay's video ended in UK I'm not sure the exact conversion at the top of my head but if you go to my webinar registration page so the 11 p.m. one will be 5 a.m. in UK and what else so one is 5 a.m. your time in UK and the other one is 6 hours ahead right I assume so it's a 11 a.m. then it should be a 5 p.m. so one is that 5 a.m. for you in UK and the 1 is that 5 p.m. for you alright yeah and so it's the same day for them for UK how about India can you check their ten and a half hours ahead of Chicago time okay so 1030 a.m. for the first webinar and what about the second time so the second time is 930 p.m. for people in India okay so 500 a.m. to 500 p.m. for UK those are the two times for India the two timings are 1030 should be 930 a.m. and 930 p.m. right to 10 and a half hours ahead all right so it's 1030 a.m. in India and then the next one is 1030 p.m. so those are the two times oh my timezone is Chicago central Chicago in Chicago so it's CST okay Central Standard Time so 11 a.m. in 1100 p.m. so November 12th 11 a.m. and November 13th at 1100 am too many timings sorry basically for me it's this Sunday night at 11 p.m. and then Monday morning at 11 a.m. awesome Constantine says I signed up it will be 11 a.m. for me so I'll be fresh and energized good don't put Monday and Sunday because for some people both of them are happening on Sunday for example for people in India it's happening the same day and for other people so just put the dates no no no no that's it no it's too confusing oh my god guys seriously just go if you can't figure it out man I don't know if maybe you shouldn't be coming to this webinar seriously go to the actual page we have this little we have this little feature okay because we're software developers we added this little feature that says convert to other time zones click on that and then it lets you convert it to your time zone so you can figure it out or just google it but yet she's got way too confusing the link is in the description so YouTube you shouldn't be doing anything right now you shouldn't be watching this video you shouldn't be waiting for me to say anything it's time to sign up for this webinar all right pause everything you're doing close out all the other tabs go sign up for this webinar on YouTube and Facebook go sign up for this webinar that's what you guys should be doing and then in the meantime I'll answer some other questions as well but boom boom boom sign up sign up for the webinar man I look like a legend drinking that calm butch up hmm all right somebody's complaining about answers and stuff okay let's see Marko's who says if i did not miss if i'm not mistaken since you're learning Python 16 hours a day for two months may I know how much workload you take per day so that's how long yep Renee you're right 11 sorry the other way 1100 p.m. and 1100 a.m. 1100 please just click the link on the description is confusing the hell out of everybody ok damn alright so if I'm not mistaken learning Python 16 hours a day I mean I know how much workload you take per day ok so I was coding a lot every day to get better but it was also because I didn't really have that much mentoring you know I had one mentor who barely got time and then he would help put me in the right path and I had to just do pretty much everything by myself had I had completely like the right path I wouldn't need to spend very minimal amount of time to actually be able to do practical stuff that gets me jobs all right I'm not saying I would be a great coder I would just be a competent coder who can start actually getting practical work and that's a place I want to put you out so especially with my course I want to set you up to a point where and take you beyond this point as well but what I want to do for you is get you to the point where you're learning basics and practical things at the same time so you're ready to get your first client and from there you start actually improving your coding skills and I'll show you what you need to be doing constantly improving your coding skills but the first most important thing is having a portfolio having projects in that portfolio and being able to show your clients that and knowing those practical skills then you can actually land those clients and make that money and get that paycheck after that if you want to get really good you want to learn about recursive Fibonacci solutions or you know do all these crazy problems on project oil or hacker rank or wherever else then you can do them on your own time ok but instead of before getting into the all the nerdy nittygritty I want to give you the practical stuff show you how to get clients start making money so you can relax breathe eat and then you can become a nerd trust me I love nothing more than nerding out when it comes to coding all right all right all right Marcus coos laughing okay fish says I've signed up for tomorrow good awesome awesome yeah move to California man I don't know what you're doing in Kansas California is awesome yeah the website I don't know what you mean by it's designed for US and Canadian citizens only Oh like the time yeah it is but yeah just convert it to your own times guys I'm sorry I'll try to add more times but there's no good way to do it without just adding a massive amount of information on there and confusing everybody so I try to put simple things I try to tell you it's est and then I have the feature to say convert to other time zones or you can go on your own just google it and hit convert to other time zones Dovie says signed up I'm pumped love all your efforts get pumped this webinar has a potential to change your life so I'm gonna say this on the webinar as well but when you come here we're not screwing around you have your phone off or on Do Not Disturb all right you have your other tabs closed and bring something to write with you okay so I have I bring a legal pad all right I have a legal pad where I write it I just stuff into my brain like nothing else so bring something to write with you pen and paper or if not maybe just write it on your laptop but be and do not disturb mode and yeah because this stuff has the potential to change your life it has taken me years to put all of this stuff together for you so make sure you show up and and just get as much value as you can and it's free okay awesome awesome would you say it would be hard for a foreigner to get a job in USA with web development that's a question I get a lot and I've been getting this question a lot from people in India so all my students were in India guys it's no different than getting a job from while you're in US okay getting clients is the same process you can get clients for in United States and UK or wherever else and I show you that in the course so don't be worried about if you're in a specific place you're limited to some kind of you know lower money or whatever okay or you're not gonna get as much work or you have to be stuck with a specific programming language don't worry about that it's the same way and it works everywhere the same way all right and that's the beauty of being a developer because you can work remotely and most of the companies now choose to work remotely Dovie Glassman says man I'm confused is it free or not the webinar the webinar is free the course isn't it's a paid course but the webinar is free so show up to it and get massive value out of it let's see The Drifter somebody's asking me the question last time all right so draft drifter asks hmm I have I misunderstood something or what do you get when you enroll to the VIP waiting list for the 90 days client course doesn't that mean it's free what you get for getting on the VIP waiting list first of all you get my bonus for how I became a software developer in less than three months so you get that bonus video that's one the second thing you get is it says you'll be notified as soon as the course is open so one way to get notified is on live streams which is great that you're here but let's say you weren't here you would still be getting those emails for when the course is open and I would be making sure that you don't miss out on it all right so though that would be the big benefit of signing up for the VIP waitlist but right now there is no VIP waitlist because the course is opening up in just a few days alright so the time is here the time is now keep in mind once the course opens it only has five days until we take students and after that it's over all right there's no more new enrollments even though you have lifetime access to the course but it's kind of like a college class once everybody enters I don't want to focus on getting new students in I want to take that group of students and make them as badass and more as skilled and getting them jobs and getting them those practical skills as possible okay so I'm gonna kind of maximize what we do with that group of students who gets inside within those that those five days and if you come to the webinar I'll break down everything about the course exactly what you will be getting in the course I'll break down what we've covered in the profitable program or masterclass and we'll also have a Q&A section so we take your questions and answer them alright draft drifters Jesus these guys were teaming up Marcus cool and draft drifter love it love it love it love it signed up and bookmarked wife should be we're hit that time so I can pay full attention good job send your wife on a massage you know send her somewhere pay $70 for a nice massage where she could go and get it and in that time you could focus in on the video whatever it takes to focus on the video okay and the girls and the wives in here send your husbands and your boyfriend somewhere and be here be with us be with the clever programmer community and we just really have amazing lifechanging stuff for you guys I mean I don't know how else to put it mmm okay let's see Renee is saying she does bunch of questions so let me see she said you should use government funding to offer it for free I use it to oversee u.s. MVM FG recruiting for a major energy company vocational schools or where it's at Jesus that's just scary to me and I don't even know what that means but Renee is not somebody I want to mess with it's basically a boot camp right but better less cumbersome the idea of this boot camp essentially or this course is I was realizing too many people had jobs too many people had kids too many people had already other other things that they needed to be doing other commitments so this course I designed it in a way where it's just hyper massively practical that's not a word but I just made it up and it's just insanely practical so meaning even if you can spend a few hours in a week and do the things that I outlined you will get results again I want to keep all the people away who think this is gonna be easy and they're just gonna come in and get all these results without putting in work guys it's not that so if that's what you're thinking don't even bother showing up to the webinar I'm just gonna say that right now but if you follow all those things right you've only are looking to spend a few hours in a week so I wanted to make sure that it's for somebody who can use Python for side hustling or freelancing or trying to get a job fulltime all right patty Pugh says yeah I have to kick my fiance off the computer I usually watch you on my phone yeah this one it's ok fiance take the El on this one but you're gonna take many double use later other than that Winston says so will there only be five days to register for the course absolutely 5 days only then the enrollments are closed so keep in mind I've only opened this course up twice in one year I opened this up sometime in April the first time for five days then I shut it down then I hope those students get results then in June we had a team at clever programmer so we had more people than just me working at clever programmer so we opened the course in June and we closed it and we got lots of students and then we helped lots of students get results because also we didn't had a bigger team now our team is even bigger and we're ready to help you crush it even more this time so this is our third time launching it after about four or five months and it's only going to be open for five days and after that we closed it down and the next time we're gonna be opening it won't be any earlier than four to five months okay all right guys thank you so much for coming other I keep looking at the questions you guys questions are awesome and I'm just gonna keep answering them thank you thank you thank you hi Maryam hello thank you guys for coming so much as always I love your faces off thank you and at this point we're well over the 1 hour mark but I want to be here for you guys so that's it thank you guys so much I love your face off and YouTube I'll see you in the next video
