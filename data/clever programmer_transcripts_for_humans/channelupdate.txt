00:02 - qazi here from clevver programmer i just
00:04 - wanted to give you a little update on
00:06 - everything that's happening
00:08 - i know that i haven't touched base with
00:09 - you guys on youtube in actually quite a
00:12 - bit
00:12 - but there are a lot of things going on
00:14 - and a lot of things happen
00:16 - so in this video i just want to get you
00:19 - all caught up
00:20 - and be on the same page but that said
00:23 - let's jump
00:23 - right into it so a lot of things have
00:26 - been happening
00:28 - recently over the last few months
00:31 - clever programmer has been growing we're
00:34 - up to
00:34 - 15 plus people on the team now
00:38 - and there's a lot of been a lot of focus
00:40 - on
00:41 - making sure that every student inside of
00:43 - our programs is really happy
00:45 - also we launched a coding bootcamp
00:47 - called full stack mastery so that has
00:49 - been requiring a lot of work
00:52 - and just recently i had to go to chicago
00:54 - because i found out
00:57 - my mom was having a heart surgery so
01:00 - i flew out um my brother my brother
01:03 - my sister-in-law called me at 8 a.m and
01:05 - she broke the news to me in cal
01:07 - i was in california at that time and i
01:09 - was just like
01:10 - so shocked that that happened then my
01:12 - brother called me
01:14 - a couple of hours later and he was like
01:16 - hey we gotta fly out to chicago
01:18 - all of us brothers and we gotta go now
01:20 - so bo
01:21 - me both of my brothers essentially took
01:24 - a flight
01:25 - uh went to chicago immediately same day
01:28 - landed there like 9 or 10 p.m and it was
01:31 - it
01:31 - was really cold like negative 10 degrees
01:35 - and basically um found out that
01:39 - my mom had the doctor said five arteries
01:42 - blocked which means
01:43 - she had to go through a quintuple bypass
01:46 - which is insane
01:47 - and we were all there to support her and
01:50 - because of kovid
01:52 - now this video is going to get
01:53 - demonetized that's fine
01:55 - uh pen i can't call it that i have to
01:57 - say pandemic so now because of the
01:59 - pandemic
02:00 - we are not allowed to go into the
02:02 - hospitals we're not actually allowed to
02:04 - be there with her
02:05 - and so what we have to do is
02:09 - um just kind of be there for a couple of
02:12 - days
02:12 - and then we found out you know four or
02:14 - five days passed we were all so scared
02:16 - nervous
02:16 - um praying asking you know i was even
02:19 - posting in the pwg community
02:21 - which is profit with javascript and
02:22 - we're like hey guys just please have my
02:24 - mom in your prayers you know wish her
02:26 - the best make sure
02:27 - she's she she comes out okay
02:30 - and we're crossing our fingers scared of
02:33 - dads sitting every single day
02:34 - seeing you know what's gonna happen next
02:37 - and basically
02:39 - um mom goes into the or comes out the
02:42 - next day and we find out
02:44 - that her surgery went through
02:45 - successfully
02:47 - so we were so happy we were so excited
02:50 - all my brothers my dad was such a big
02:53 - moment of relief
02:55 - and then we were so happy that she's
02:57 - gonna come in you know and essentially
02:59 - now it's like you know a car getting a
03:01 - brand new
03:02 - engine and so oh that's funny jack is
03:05 - here
03:06 - that's our bunny so it's like she just
03:08 - got a whole new
03:09 - engine and now she has you know
03:12 - essentially a whole new heart and it and
03:14 - it's a bypass surgery so basically they
03:16 - take
03:17 - arteries from other parts of your body
03:18 - and reroute it around your heart
03:21 - so when that happened i was so pumped
03:24 - that it went through
03:25 - successfully finally mom came home and
03:29 - the first few days were the most
03:30 - difficult for her but after that
03:32 - she came out like a champ uh right now
03:35 - she's
03:36 - in her 30th day of recovery or more
03:39 - so super happy about that couple of days
03:41 - ago was her birthday february 28th
03:43 - and she sent me her photo with uh
03:46 - sitting with my brother and we were so
03:47 - happy i was there for 10 20 days
03:49 - now i came back my brothers are still
03:51 - there with her i believe
03:53 - and she's just so supportive we all love
03:56 - her so much but the thing is that she is
03:57 - one of the
03:58 - strongest people i've ever come across
04:01 - on the planet
04:02 - personally if i was going through it i
04:04 - would have
04:05 - i honestly don't know if i would survive
04:08 - first of all
04:09 - second of all i just don't think i would
04:10 - have it in me to be as strong as her
04:12 - because i just hear so many scary horror
04:15 - stories
04:16 - every place when i went to like when i
04:18 - was scared
04:19 - and i was nervous i was going and
04:20 - reading on reddit what people's
04:22 - experiences were and they just said it's
04:24 - like the worst thing a lot of people
04:25 - were like
04:26 - i wanted my life to end her like
04:29 - yeah she was in pain but she came out of
04:31 - it like that
04:33 - and every day was tough but
04:37 - we just have to make sure like she's
04:38 - walking she's like comfortable she's
04:41 - able to do everything that you can do so
04:43 - she's just fully recovering
04:45 - and that's one important thing you have
04:47 - to make sure that you're walking a lot
04:49 - which is weird because you would be like
04:50 - hey
04:51 - this person just got their heart fixed
04:52 - why would you have them just rest
04:54 - forever it's like no
04:55 - they actually have to walk around a lot
04:57 - they should actually go up the stairs
04:58 - down the stairs
05:00 - and they need to keep their blood flow
05:03 - up
05:04 - walking and exercise is actually more
05:06 - important than even resting
05:10 - so she had really good rest really good
05:13 - walking
05:14 - uh and yeah so she's recovered i'm back
05:17 - so that's good uh now
05:21 - we're finally getting back into the flow
05:23 - of starting to put out content on
