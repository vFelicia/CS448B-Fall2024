08:48 - city where they're drug cartels in every
08:51 - corner a collie cartel is gonna kill you
08:54 - Pablo Escobar's men are gonna come out
08:56 - of somewhere and we definitely didn't
08:58 - even see anybody dealing with drugs this
09:01 - was what we saw was an amazing place all
09:04 - of those other things were just
09:05 - stereotypes was a beautiful place with
09:07 - loving people
