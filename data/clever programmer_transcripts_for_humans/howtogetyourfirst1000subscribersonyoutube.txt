01:18 - oh man we provided value to 34 million
01:21 - people oh man we have helped the world
01:24 - move forward by 2.6

01:30 - a few hundred years right we help the
01:32 - world move forward so that to me is
01:34 - exciting and i feel like if we do this
01:36 - together and we
01:38 - help the world move forward that is the
01:40 - biggest fastest way to make an impact
01:42 - and it doesn't matter
01:43 - if you're a developer it doesn't matter
01:45 - if you're somebody who is into cooking
01:47 - it doesn't matter if you're somebody

03:46 - now i'm gonna go back and i think the
03:48 - best way i can share this with you
03:50 - is how did i get my first 1000
03:52 - subscribers right and i just want to
03:54 - kind of recap this
03:55 - i want to talk about how i went from
03:57 - zero to 8300 subscribers i want to talk
03:59 - about how i went from
04:00 - zero to over 30 million views and i'm
04:03 - going to talk about how
04:04 - i went at the age of 26 from zero to 2.6
04:08 - million dollars
04:09 - under the age of 26. for me the catalyst
04:12 - that allowed me to change my life
04:14 - you know a boy from pakistan who came
04:16 - here and had nothing
04:17 - and completely transformed is because
04:20 - youtube allowed me to help and make a
04:22 - big impact in other people's lives that
04:25 - as a result
04:26 - led to a lot of other people's financial
04:28 - freedom just from viewing
04:29 - our youtube content for free and led to
04:32 - my financial freedom and our teams
04:35 - because
04:36 - we gave value to the world we got value
04:38 - back it's just as simple as that
04:40 - and i want to help you guys do the same
04:42 - thing so i'm going to show you guys
04:44 - what the journey in the start like

07:53 - just give me a link in slack
07:55 - okay thank you all right

08:02 - question
08:02 - matt says hell yeah carol says yeah
08:04 - beautiful raul
08:06 - nice critic says did this today critic
08:09 - made a
08:10 - youtube video let me actually check that
08:13 - out
08:18 - wow this is so hi everyone it's kritik
08:20 - here from criticism
08:24 - makes you look professional like to make
08:27 - sure you're
08:28 - like for as little as 370 hmm
08:36 - okay cool um so all right critic
08:40 - good video a few important things one i
08:42 - think look at the camera
08:50 - you come in i want you
08:53 - to comment on my each and every okay
08:57 - so you're wanting too many things but
08:59 - you're not giving me enough value and
09:00 - then it seems like you're trying to sell
09:02 - me something
09:03 - also i would use your voice like i
09:05 - wouldn't
09:06 - recommend like speech to texting because
09:09 - as a human being i don't want to deal
09:11 - with a robot
09:12 - right like i actually want to deal with
09:14 - a human being not a robot so that's
09:16 - important
09:18 - anora yes this meeting is being recorded
09:22 - uh okay great so here's a question that
09:24 - we got
09:25 - so i'll bring this up by dixon he says
09:27 - hey what do you recommend on social
09:29 - media accounts
09:30 - before i become a developer i was
09:32 - posting anything on my facebook twitter
09:33 - and instagram do i delete all start
09:35 - afresh or how do i go about it
09:38 - so never delete anything
09:41 - ever i mean unless it's like really
09:44 - something horrible that you put up
09:46 - that you know it's either you're
09:47 - discriminating against somebody or it's
09:49 - hate speech or bullying or
09:52 - if it's not a violent sin or a crime
09:56 - never delete anything always just move
09:59 - forward
10:01 - before i become before i become a
10:03 - developer i was posting anything on
10:04 - facebook yeah
10:05 - so all you need to do dixon is just keep
10:08 - sharing the part of the journey that
10:10 - you're at that's all so when it comes to
10:12 - like making a youtube or making a
10:13 - facebook or making a twitter
10:15 - or an instagram it's all about just
10:18 - sharing
10:18 - the part of the journey where you were
10:20 - at all right that's it and then you just
10:21 - go forward
10:23 - that's everything you don't need to go
10:26 - beyond that okay if you then want to go
10:30 - to the next level and
10:31 - really truly focus on providing value
10:32 - for people making content for them
10:35 - you can do that as well but in the start
10:38 - if you just
10:38 - document your journey and what is
10:40 - happening in your life you're good
10:43 - all right let's see if we have more
10:45 - questions
10:49 - all right we got yesterday's live that
10:51 - sick because
10:52 - that means that um i can give you guys
10:55 - feedback on your videos
10:59 - like look at this this is insane 907
11:02 - comments thank you guys for that that is
11:05 - huge
11:09 - this is my latest video so let's check
11:11 - out ricardo's video
11:17 - it's a pretty cool start oh [ __ ]
11:23 - damn boy that's nice
11:27 - um i would say something here because
11:29 - i'm not understanding what is going on
11:31 - so far
11:32 - and there's a lot of time being wasted
11:35 - on this like still frame that's not
11:36 - moving
11:39 - still you're not talking to me about
11:41 - what's going on
11:42 - [Music]
11:47 - okay i see what's happening so it's just
11:49 - like you're showing the park okay
11:57 - um it's not entertaining because
12:00 - i get to watch the park but it's kind of
12:02 - like your dad
12:03 - making a video of like a park with a
12:05 - cell phone and just like sending it to
12:07 - you and you're like dad what are you
12:08 - doing
12:09 - so
12:12 - the reason why this channel isn't
12:15 - breaking a thousand subscribers is
12:17 - because it's just footage it's just like
12:20 - random almost like stock footage so
12:22 - that's not gonna blow up unless it's
12:24 - truly just like
12:25 - an 8k resolution and like the best thing
12:28 - on the planet to watch
12:30 - you know so here what would make this
12:32 - entertaining
12:33 - is a voice over you know a story behind
12:36 - this park or
12:38 - why is this park so valuable why should
12:40 - people go to it
12:42 - context behind this i think that would
12:44 - make it entertaining to watch
12:45 - and in the start i wouldn't waste so
12:47 - much time on this
12:49 - because the start is where it's the most
12:51 - important so if you can't get people
12:53 - past your start
12:55 - you're not going to get people much
12:56 - farther than that
12:59 - all right cool
13:05 - nice i see people are now dropping their
13:08 - things cool cool cool i didn't get a
13:10 - notification
13:11 - yeah it's kind of sad i don't know like
13:12 - why we
13:14 - we weren't able to send you guys an
13:15 - email for some reason
13:17 - um and you know like we sent the text to
13:20 - you guys and hopefully that got you guys
13:22 - here

20:21 - why not just show your face then like
20:23 - why is the code like
20:24 - maybe the code could have been cool
20:26 - showing for like two seconds
20:28 - but then it should cut to your face and
20:29 - you should be talking
20:31 - um like i don't know why i'm looking at
20:35 - code i'm like am i trying to follow this
20:37 - code i'm trying am i
20:38 - am i making this app but it doesn't seem
20:40 - like it it just seems like
20:42 - you have like something playing and then
20:44 - it's almost like it's just in the
20:45 - background
20:46 - and then you just have a voiceover on it
20:48 - which is like completely
20:49 - it's not very it's not relevant at all
20:51 - like your image and what you're talking
20:53 - about
20:53 - has no relevance to each other it's
20:55 - almost like if you came to my coding
20:57 - channel and i had zebras running
20:59 - and i was like talking about like apple
21:01 - ios
21:02 - or something crazy so i would say
21:05 - that i would just show your face
21:08 - and i would just sit there and talk in
21:09 - front of the camera
21:11 - like you can do that another thing is
21:13 - you're very low energy dude
21:15 - you're very like chill and like low
21:17 - energy
21:18 - which there's nothing wrong with but
21:20 - your strength is then
21:21 - um then you got to sit there and edit
21:24 - your video you got to make it tight
21:26 - i'm wasting a lot of time between guys
21:31 - i think um your
21:34 - ios is pretty good
21:38 - and then if you have thoughts and you're
21:41 - going to speak them in a low energy way
21:42 - then you need to use editing to keep the
21:44 - pace up
21:45 - cut every single like
21:48 - pause out keep the pace up increase the
21:52 - volume on it
21:54 - and don't drown out don't make music
21:56 - compete with you your music right now is
21:58 - competing or almost
21:59 - louder than your actual video you think
22:04 - for me for now i just would say that
22:07 - right the music is so loud i can barely
22:09 - hear it
22:10 - you enjoy the quick programming in the
22:13 - background
22:16 - [Music]
22:18 - as ios developers and doesn't matter if
22:21 - you
22:22 - do it with swift directly or to
22:27 - unity also it's for
22:30 - yes so there's coding going on so i'm
22:33 - looking at coding and paying attention
22:34 - to coding
22:35 - there's loud music and then your voice
22:38 - is very low
22:39 - the three things are completely separate
22:42 - from each other
22:42 - and they're competing they're all
22:44 - competing for my attention
22:46 - there's very little of anything i can
22:49 - pay attention to
22:50 - focus keep your [ __ ] simple
22:53 - um look at the camera and talk if you
22:55 - have to talk
22:56 - if it's going to be a talking video have
22:58 - graphics or b-roll come over it to
23:01 - support
23:02 - like your main point whatever point it
23:05 - is that you're trying to make
23:06 - right when you're talking about unity
23:07 - maybe a graphic of unity comes up if
23:09 - you're talking about c sharp
23:11 - or ios apps their logo pops up
23:14 - if you're then talking about their
23:17 - commissions the commission thing pops up
23:19 - right
23:19 - if you have trouble with editing use
23:22 - slides
23:23 - just literally use google slides and do
23:25 - it you guys can crush it with just
23:27 - google slides not even show your face
23:29 - have slides that'll keep you on script
23:31 - and then just like have images in each
23:33 - slide and then just talk about them
23:34 - and just keep going so that's another
23:36 - way of doing it
23:39 - uh great cool cool cool
23:43 - all right let's keep going it's the
23:46 - beginning
23:46 - i'm looking at your guys's comments
23:53 - okay cool
23:59 - yep kristen you can you can i'm glad you
24:01 - can improve a lot bro
24:03 - yeah i'm i'm glad that you're not taking
24:05 - it personally and you're actually using
24:07 - the feedback
24:08 - it's going to help you tremendously
24:11 - uh background music keep it very low
24:15 - like
24:16 - juan is asking
24:20 - uh crap let's bring it right here and
24:23 - let's bring that right here okay cool
24:26 - so juan is asking hey what about um
24:29 - background noise should i have that in
24:31 - my
24:32 - music or or should i have that in my
24:34 - tutorial or or no
24:36 - i would say that keep it very low keep
24:39 - the background noise
24:41 - music very low during tutorials very low
24:45 - almost like you cannot hear
24:47 - it and in the start keep it high so the
24:51 - energy is high and it's like
24:53 - what's up this is one music is going
24:56 - and then it just like starts to vanish
24:58 - as time progresses okay
25:01 - uh beautiful so yuri says my video will
25:04 - be out tomorrow i love that
25:06 - i'm the amadeus says
25:09 - can you give me feedback okay so let's
25:12 - go here
25:13 - and see if we can give him feedback
25:18 - so welcome to my channel i have decided
25:20 - to take part in a 5-day
25:22 - quiz challenge so i have done thousands
25:25 - of e-commerce courses
25:26 - and for the year i've been doing this on
25:28 - the alligator platform in poland
25:31 - so now i decided to switch to
25:34 - shopify and increase my possibilities so
25:37 - guys i love ecommerce and i want to
25:39 - share
25:40 - this love for you guys for you with you
25:44 - so now what will be my strategy and
25:47 - purpose of this channel i will i want to
25:50 - inspire you that age
25:51 - it doesn't matter on this field so
25:54 - if you only have a vision and dream
25:57 - everything is possible
25:59 - so something weird is happening to me in
26:01 - this video i'm like almost getting
26:02 - hypnotized watching it
26:04 - so who i will follow it's extremely
26:07 - important to
26:08 - learn from people it's like a mixture
26:10 - between like e-commerce asmr
26:12 - and hypnosis you are where you want to
26:14 - be
26:15 - guys i have a question for you do you
26:18 - want to
26:22 - what
26:27 - to go to your destination in a fiat
26:30 - multipla or for
26:32 - ferrari both will get you to your
26:35 - destination
26:36 - but at what time so
26:40 - ask yourself what is your choice but
26:43 - my choice is of course i want to be in
26:45 - ferrari
26:46 - so [ __ ] multipla and let's go
26:49 - regarding fbs is the mass of the course
26:53 - who teaching it i made thousands of them
26:56 - in total in poland such
26:57 - as pl etc etc no one of them
27:01 - could match the value he gave for free
27:04 - kevin zhang
27:05 - so on this challenge i will follow his
27:08 - instruction
27:09 - and his setup for a facebook ads
27:13 - i know that's worked because he made
27:15 - over 20 million dollars
27:19 - from this
27:22 - what's happening oh wow
27:27 - oh i can't wait to see julio's where on
27:29 - youtube or where
27:31 - in facebook group
27:38 - um so okay so basically for this
27:42 - what i'm gonna say is um
27:46 - it's uh there's something really weird
27:50 - bro here that's going on here
27:51 - it's very entertaining to me i don't
27:53 - know why like i kind of wanted to just
27:55 - keep
27:55 - listening like i feel hypnotized to
27:58 - listen
27:58 - i don't know it's really amusing to me
28:00 - in some weird way
28:02 - um i think
28:06 - because this is not an audio platform
28:08 - and it's a video platform
28:10 - have if you're not going to have your
28:12 - face at least have like google slides
28:14 - and just have a presentation
28:16 - so then images move here so as you're
28:18 - talking it goes to the next slide and
28:20 - the slide after that and slide after
28:22 - that
28:24 - uh so i think it could be a really
28:26 - interesting channel
28:28 - and just and just the energy you have
28:30 - man is like
28:31 - it's kind of it's it's kind of magnetic
28:36 - so keep going like i i kind of like in a
28:40 - really weird way believe in this
28:44 - uh but yeah that's those are my thoughts
28:45 - on it just produce more
28:47 - give it some structure and then have
28:50 - slides or something that visually moves
28:53 - b-roll stock image and then actually
28:56 - give valuable stuff and and
28:58 - keep going might be a weird channel it
29:01 - just blows up
29:02 - all right we got julio in the house
29:04 - let's go julio let's see what you got
29:06 - brother
29:09 - and guys is it okay if i can get like

30:42 - let's um let's go ahead and take a look
30:46 - at
30:46 - this video intro the start of my new
30:49 - youtube journey
30:51 - nice so just looking at this channel so
30:54 - far
30:55 - the only video i want to watch is this
30:57 - one i don't want to watch
30:58 - any of these other ones the reason is
31:02 - this is just weird but that's okay don't
31:04 - delete anything
31:06 - um this i'm not sure could be pretty
31:09 - good but the title is not
31:11 - it means anything to me and then here
31:13 - this one
31:15 - i also have no idea what's going on so
31:17 - i'm not going to click on it
31:18 - this one looks like a youtuber's video
31:20 - so i want to
31:22 - you know and i would take away the word
31:24 - intro i would just call it the start of
31:27 - my new youtube journey i think that'd be
31:28 - cool
31:29 - and let's click on it and watch what is
31:31 - happening
31:32 - uh julio says i just posted an intro for
31:35 - accountability so no music or cuts but i
31:37 - play with the vlog format a lot would
31:39 - love to know if you have any suggestions
31:40 - for
31:41 - me talking to the camera and because i
31:43 - know
31:44 - uh julio he's on my instagram
31:48 - i love his energy so i think this vlog
31:50 - is gonna be pretty
31:51 - uh entertaining and he should keep doing
31:53 - this but let's go
31:55 - guys let's get things started hey
31:58 - already it's like a good youtube video
32:01 - all right i'm excited
32:02 - so we're not in the weird territory
32:04 - anymore so as i said on my instagram
32:06 - i've decided to start a youtube channel
32:08 - pretty soon
32:09 - so this isn't actually gonna be my first
32:11 - video it's just gonna be an introduction
32:13 - of what it is that i'm planning on
32:15 - showing or what content i'm planning on
32:18 - creating
32:18 - rewarded uh based on their importance
32:21 - we can actually uh
32:25 - we can actually rank our importance it's
32:28 - a public rank where the artist knows who
32:30 - we are
32:31 - as fans and then can reward us
32:33 - personally so that
32:34 - i help you now when you're small and
32:36 - you're emerging
32:37 - you buy equipment make it in the
32:39 - industry i help you promote
32:42 - and then if you make it then maybe you
32:44 - can return to me with some rewards
32:45 - knowing that i'm your top
32:47 - one two three or f fifth fan right
32:50 - anyway so that started and i really
32:53 - really wanted to see
32:59 - and yeah and what i think i know okay so
33:01 - my thoughts on this
33:02 - is it's a good video i know that you did
33:04 - it just kind of like to do it
33:07 - um i would like if you look at me more
33:10 - and talk to me more
33:12 - um like in the start it felt very warm
33:15 - and like
33:15 - almost like you care for me and then
33:18 - here it feels a little cold like you
33:20 - don't care about me you're just like
33:22 - telling me what you do that you're good
33:24 - at or something like that
33:25 - um outside of that i think that
33:29 - this is a really great channel i think
33:31 - that if you
33:32 - keep putting out content i think it will
33:34 - work for you
33:35 - you have a really good personality you
33:37 - have good communication skills
33:39 - so i would push harder on it for you i
33:42 - recommend
33:42 - learn video editing spend time i think
33:45 - you're a fast dude
33:46 - i think you learn quick uh you have very
33:50 - high energy
33:50 - so your videos will bang
33:54 - your energy combined with learning
33:56 - editing and storytelling whatever it is
33:58 - you're trying to do
33:59 - you can do it faster by being able to
34:01 - have those skills
34:03 - so love it julio all right
34:06 - stacy sent me something so let's go
34:08 - ahead and take a look at that
34:14 - [Music]
34:18 - what is happening here
34:25 - [Music]
34:41 - um so i'm not sure what's happening here
34:45 - but it is fun music um
34:49 - okay this is a brand new channel for
34:51 - showcasing project oriented programming
34:53 - okay we share
34:54 - replit and github thanks for watching
34:56 - okay cool
34:57 - i would give it some kind of face or
34:59 - some kind of direction because right now
35:01 - it seems very faceless and generic and
35:03 - random and almost like a
35:05 - almost like a computer generated this
35:07 - video doesn't even seem like a human
35:09 - generated this video
35:10 - so um also i don't really understand
35:14 - what is happening here like
35:17 - i don't get it discover why our
35:19 - customers love pop code maker
35:22 - nobody cares because nobody knows about
35:24 - a pop code maker
35:26 - uh so you have to find a way to make me
35:28 - care you have to find
35:29 - like nobody cares about your stuff at
35:31 - all like nobody's here to watch your
35:33 - stuff about you
35:34 - and what you offer there's never a video
35:38 - where it's just like
35:39 - you guys come in like for coding right i
35:42 - can't just drop a video on my thing it's
35:43 - like
35:44 - come to our service profit with
35:46 - javascript profit with javascript
35:49 - you get one-on-one coaching you got
35:51 - one-on-one coaching and it's just like
35:53 - tries to hypnotize you buy our product
35:56 - there's no video like that because we
35:57 - know if we made it it would get like two
35:59 - views even though we have a channel with
36:00 - 830 000 subscribers
36:02 - nobody cares about our stuff for us
36:05 - people want to watch stuff that they
36:06 - want to watch that will be actually
36:08 - entertaining to them
36:08 - so make stuff that's um ha guys get rid
36:12 - of this like non-human [ __ ] that people
36:14 - are doing like
36:15 - put a [ __ ] face in there if you're
36:17 - scared like get unscared and just put
36:19 - your face in there talk
36:21 - look at the camera just some normal like
36:24 - human
36:24 - communication skills like i think are
36:26 - really important guys so
36:28 - i think it's one of the best ways to
36:29 - grow your channel
36:33 - all right beautiful miriam says
36:35 - yesterday i didn't follow the stream but
36:36 - i'm here now so i'm going to shoot on
36:38 - saturday 20
36:39 - 7 pm edit on sunday beautiful exciting
36:42 - exciting
36:44 - all right let's see joey
36:50 - you're up joey
36:54 - oh i got a good feeling about this one
37:00 - [Music]
37:04 - joey um
37:08 - this will do well if you're modeling
37:10 - channels you know that's a good idea
37:13 - i think that your fastest way to blowing
37:15 - up is tick-tock
37:17 - i've seen [ __ ] like this on tick-tock
37:18 - and ig reels blow
37:20 - up so i would say focus on that and then
37:23 - funnel
37:24 - people to these youtube videos and i
37:26 - think that'll be your fastest way to
37:28 - grow
37:29 - especially guys when you don't add your
37:31 - personality into it it's really hard to
37:33 - like
37:34 - grow it on youtube you know like i think
37:37 - one
37:38 - big thing that you can do is just by
37:39 - simply adding your personality in here
37:41 - and you now got a much better chance of
37:45 - winning on this platform
37:48 - all right cool uh julio says nobody
37:51 - thank you boss and yes i'll get to
37:53 - editing on my first video soon beautiful
37:55 - uh we got muktum here let's take a look

43:39 - culture
43:40 - and that and we're protecting it and
43:42 - preserving it and
43:44 - it is already changing everything so
43:46 - just like listening to this is amazing
43:48 - and then just like the beat and
43:50 - everything because like for me
43:52 - even when i listen to motivational stuff
43:53 - like i'm always like damn
43:56 - i want to make my own motivational stuff
43:57 - just so i can add a trap beat on it or
44:00 - like hip-hop or something

44:04 - with so [ __ ] hard
44:06 - and then you're talking about mental

44:23 - here are the areas where i want you to
44:25 - improve okay olivia this is important
44:27 - because you're sitting on something
44:28 - where if you keep going with this this
44:30 - will actually become something
44:31 - and there's a reason why i followed and
44:33 - i'm sure people on the stream

44:44 - um i wanna see you better and then maybe
44:47 - if you can get a yeti mic so i could
44:49 - hear you better because right now i'm
44:51 - very distracted between here
44:54 - and here and like looking at what's
44:57 - happening in the background and looking
44:58 - at this vent
44:59 - so that a lot of it okay
45:03 - but please hear me on this i want you to
45:05 - keep making videos even with the bad
45:07 - quality
45:08 - quote unquote not the best quality so
45:11 - don't let my words
45:12 - stop you from making content because
45:13 - you're like i will wait until i get the
45:15 - best
45:16 - no no don't do that i want you to keep
45:19 - making content i'll give you some simple
45:20 - tips if you shoot in daylight
45:22 - where the window is pointing to you
45:24 - already your lighting problems are
45:26 - solved
45:27 - it's like already ready to go if you
45:30 - just put up a light on you
45:32 - that's like clear and then you just sit
45:34 - there and give me
45:36 - the words you're gonna give me heavy
45:38 - hitting because the whole thing is about
45:40 - mindset and voice
45:42 - it would really help me if the audio
45:43 - quality is better
45:45 - so if you can actually you know get a
45:48 - yeti mic or something something cheap

53:03 - make this content now
53:04 - creating an android mini car park app
53:06 - okay let's take a look at this
53:09 - hello guys um okay today i'll be
53:11 - creating a really simple car park
53:14 - application for android um it's actually
53:17 - universal
53:18 - right outside of troll but then what i
53:22 - can
53:22 - [Music]
53:26 - okay i got your problem okay so let's
53:28 - see
53:30 - i'm just gonna take a look at one last
53:32 - thing when was the newest video
53:35 - one month ago
53:41 - our body that's called elevation
53:45 - right elevation is how high do you want
53:48 - it
53:48 - nice so here is the main problem okay
53:51 - this is what
53:52 - difference between professional
53:54 - youtubers and amateur this is how i know
53:56 - you're an amateur youtuber my friend
53:59 - all right let's get into the rose
54:00 - session
54:02 - so you have these videos that have
54:05 - clearly gotten 34 000
54:07 - 24 000 views but the last time you
54:10 - dropped them
54:10 - was five years ago three
54:14 - years ago five years ago so
54:18 - um that's the number one way that's how
54:20 - you not
54:21 - not grow your channel to 1 000
54:23 - subscribers this is how you do it guys
54:26 - you find what works and then you decide
54:29 - deliberately you pre-meditate and think
54:32 - about it
54:33 - you decide not to do more of it that's
54:35 - the number one way
54:37 - to not grow your channel
54:40 - so the the best advice i can give to
54:43 - that
54:44 - is don't do that don't find
54:48 - what works let the market tell you that
54:50 - it works
54:53 - let your channel blow up and then go
54:55 - okay i'm not going to do more of this
54:56 - anymore
54:57 - so that's one thing i will say
55:00 - make more content like this that worked
55:03 - right
55:04 - this should give you an insight into the
55:07 - things that are working what i would do
55:09 - is i would make more content maybe make
55:11 - a
55:12 - react app where you're showing how to
55:13 - build an app
55:16 - and it'll kill that's what we're doing a
55:18 - clevver programmer and it crushes it
55:22 - so you know
55:26 - i think that if you do that along with
55:29 - post consistently i think you will win
55:30 - because you get it you're already past
55:32 - the 500 subscribers
55:34 - you just got a few more subscribers
55:35 - right now while we're on this
55:42 - all right cool
55:51 - [Music]
55:55 - cool make good content on popular titles
55:58 - on specially stuff that is performed
55:59 - well historically
56:01 - there's a number one way to not grow by
56:02 - not listening to the historic
56:04 - um historical data so there you go
56:07 - salman
56:07 - that's my feedback for you bro
56:11 - make more of the stuff that worked
56:13 - vicente says that was a light rasquazzi
56:15 - hey rafikaze decaf please
56:17 - radion sent me one and goes dark
56:21 - dark roast me boss i [ __ ] love this
56:25 - let's go all right radion wants a dark
56:30 - roast
56:31 - let's give him a dark roast
56:35 - [Music]
56:40 - yo what's up everybody welcome to tnp
56:42 - and welcome to my first react video here
56:45 - in this youtube channel
56:46 - so this is my first time coding on react
56:49 - and
56:50 - i think i'm going to do more videos
56:51 - using react because
56:53 - for me react is the best framework the
56:55 - best javascript framework
56:57 - if you don't know react react is a
57:00 - framework built by facebook is used to
57:03 - create web applications with
57:05 - one page or multiple pages using
57:08 - routes but you you gotta keep it moving
57:12 - bro and the start like you can't just
57:14 - hold it and not do
57:16 - anything in the start um so make sure
57:19 - that in the start you're
57:20 - keeping it moving like my visuals if
57:22 - they don't change for more than two
57:23 - seconds i'm already out
57:25 - but definitely if they're like not
57:27 - moving for
57:28 - this long then i'm definitely going to
57:30 - be out to build a youtube converter app
57:33 - if you don't know what is a youtube
57:35 - converter we are i'm going to search
57:37 - right now on google and show you so
57:40 - youtube
57:41 - have that [ __ ] prepared beforehand bro
57:43 - don't waste my time on it like
57:45 - if you want to show me what a youtube
57:46 - converter app is have it open already
57:49 - or put it on previous slides like have
57:51 - slideshow
57:52 - or have it prepared so then when you
57:54 - move to it you can move to and i can see
57:56 - it right away because like
57:58 - it's taking me too long to get to what
58:00 - we're going to be doing
58:01 - and why we're going to be doing it i
58:03 - also don't care about like
58:04 - what react.js framework is if i'm not
58:07 - like
58:08 - sold on the idea of what we're going to
58:10 - be building
58:11 - so the right way to do it is start it
58:15 - with the app
58:16 - be like we are going to be building this
58:19 - youtube converter app with react.js if
58:21 - you're excited smash the like button
58:23 - let's get in right into this video
58:25 - that's how you respect my time that's
58:27 - how you actually get me to pay attention
58:30 - and go to the next seconds if the video
58:32 - starts with this
58:34 - where it's like five seconds of your
58:35 - [ __ ] intro with nothing
58:37 - [Music]
58:40 - um i'm out you just wasted my time i
58:42 - don't care about what
58:43 - how fancy your [ __ ] logo is or what
58:46 - kind of graphics you have behind it it's
58:48 - it's a waste of my time it's not
58:50 - respectful to me
58:54 - right so five seconds in i don't know
58:56 - what is happening or what this is about
58:57 - or what i'm gonna get out of it what's
58:59 - up everybody welcome
59:00 - six seconds in welcome eight seconds in
59:03 - 10 seconds 12 seconds
59:07 - i still have no idea what it is about i
59:09 - think i'm going to do more videos
59:11 - using react because i don't care because
59:14 - um it's my first time so i don't care
59:17 - why you're
59:18 - gonna do more videos on react or this is
59:20 - your first time doing a video on react
59:21 - for me
59:22 - react is the best i don't care about you
59:24 - i care about me
59:25 - i still don't understand what's in it
59:26 - for me framework the best javascript
59:29 - framework
59:30 - i don't care because i don't even know
59:31 - what the app is that we're building and
59:33 - maybe i already know about react
59:35 - if you don't know react react is uh
59:38 - i probably wouldn't click on a video
59:40 - with react js if i didn't already know
59:42 - what it is so right now it might not be
59:44 - the best time to explain to me about
59:46 - react.js
59:49 - is used to create web applications with
59:51 - and then
59:52 - i mean by this time i'm out bro so
59:56 - um how to improve it get into the app
60:00 - really really fast as soon as you
60:03 - possibly can
60:04 - your first five seconds should be
60:06 - extremely relevant to what this video is
60:08 - gonna be about
60:09 - so i'll give you an example right if you
60:11 - go to clever programmer look at how we
60:13 - do our live streams this is one hack we
60:14 - learn and it helps us
60:16 - dominate so let me actually show you

61:06 - i've done that in the first 17 seconds
61:09 - because i'm respecting your time
61:11 - in the first year with your boy
61:14 - in the first four seconds i cut to the
61:17 - screen and i start even
61:18 - showing and demonstrating what we're
61:20 - gonna be working on i'm getting your
61:22 - trust
61:24 - if you don't see me get your trust then
61:26 - you're not gonna like follow it right
61:28 - let's see what happens in this video
61:30 - everybody hope you get
61:32 - so let's go down to let's pick out some
61:35 - other clone
61:36 - oh [ __ ] frankie and amana 25 000 views
61:43 - bro i want more of you more of you on
61:46 - the channel
61:47 - because you're dropping views
61:51 - all right so let's go to ones that are i
61:54 - mean this is like i think really crazy
61:55 - because we've edited this
62:00 - but um what i'm trying to find is i'm
62:02 - trying to find like our live stream so
62:04 - let me go to not live now let's
62:06 - go to uh past live streams
62:09 - and i want to go to like some of the
62:11 - some of the stuff where we're building
62:14 - apps for you guys
62:19 - so build a tinder clone build an airbn
62:22 - so this one let's click on this
62:28 - good boy sonny how's it going guys good
62:30 - to see you
62:31 - again and today we're gonna be building
62:34 - the
62:34 - react clone of
62:38 - airbnb so there
62:41 - 10 seconds in and the scene is set
62:44 - right the stage is set you know what
62:46 - you're going to be building
62:47 - you can see it you can visualize it you
62:50 - can touch it taste it smell it
62:52 - and now you got it now if you want to
62:54 - leave go ahead and leave
62:56 - but you visually see what we're going to
62:57 - be building i'm not using so many of my
62:59 - words to waste your time
63:01 - and you're like dude i don't know if
63:02 - it's going to be [ __ ] actually good
63:04 - or not
63:06 - i might as well just leave so in the
63:08 - start it's extremely important to
63:10 - put your hook and demonstrate truly why
63:14 - i will stick through and watch your
63:16 - video
63:18 - so that's that other than that i think
63:20 - the video is pretty good
63:22 - this drink so
63:27 - and again you know maybe volume up
63:29 - energy up
63:30 - um if your energy is not that up then
63:33 - maybe
63:34 - a better job with editing and better
63:37 - audio quality so i would
63:39 - invest in a better mic because there's a
63:41 - lot of noise i can hear in the back
63:43 - and i forgot
63:46 - right i can hear your computer fan
63:48 - running or your
63:49 - room fan running and leaves a bad taste
63:53 - in my mouth
63:56 - all right cool let's see who else we got
64:02 - nice hopefully you guys are liking this
64:04 - love the contrast calling your
64:05 - thumbnails of your videos
64:07 - thank you all right
64:16 - so the real secret guys
64:19 - to breaking your first 1000 subscribers
64:24 - right
64:25 - on youtube is really oh what did i do
64:28 - oh [ __ ] close everything
64:32 - all right so hopefully we'll get
64:34 - everything back up and running in a
64:38 - second
64:41 - oh wow all right sorry about that guys
64:47 - so the real secret to growing your
64:50 - channel
64:51 - and getting it started and getting it
64:54 - past
64:56 - that 1 000 subscriber mark
64:59 - is really
65:05 - keep posting more content so one is your
65:08 - quantity of content so you want to keep
65:10 - posting
65:11 - more so let's say this is what happens
65:13 - when you post more and then let's say
65:15 - this is your views
65:16 - right so you want to post more content
65:19 - and you will keep increasing linearly
65:21 - most of the times
65:23 - if you post more banger content then you
65:25 - will improve a lot faster
65:27 - so if i go into my journey of what
65:30 - happened
65:31 - i'll show you behind my analytics if you
65:34 - guys want to take a look at that
65:41 - and i'll go to where i broke my first
65:43 - 1000 subscribers
65:59 - literally was april to december 3rd
66:03 - right so you can see very little
66:06 - subscribers for a while and then boom
66:08 - december 3rd was was the exact day i hit
66:11 - my
66:12 - 1 000 subscribers so
66:15 - that's my friends how this took place is
66:18 - because
66:20 - right here i started making
66:23 - a lot of content so if you look here
66:26 - there's a lot of content right
66:29 - almost none of you guys that shared with
66:30 - me your channels
66:32 - very few of you actually had this volume
66:35 - of content and then
66:36 - when it comes to the content it's very
66:38 - precise
66:39 - niche down and then like on banker
66:42 - titles
66:43 - so because these titles i knew would get
66:46 - a lot of viewership so then it's
66:48 - tons of viewership and then i just made
66:50 - sure that the videos are good so
66:52 - let's go to my channel
66:56 - and i'm gonna go to videos
67:00 - and by the way guys if you're enjoying
67:01 - this smash that like button if you're
67:03 - whether on your face
67:04 - facebook or youtube
67:07 - this way the video goes out to more and
67:09 - more people
67:18 - julio says this is definitely a dope
67:20 - format reacting to channels live
67:22 - is interesting to watch even when you're
67:24 - not the one getting raided
67:26 - yeah so there it is right boom going
67:29 - through this
67:30 - and i made a bunch of these videos right
67:33 - the codecademy tutorial and it was a
67:35 - popular title then i launched a python
67:38 - programming series which
67:39 - like and eventually just blew the [ __ ]
67:42 - up
67:43 - uh this put me on the map right three or
67:45 - four thousand views 288 000 views 157
67:48 - 000 views um and then i made some random
67:52 - content that ended up not doing well
67:54 - because it was just too random for
67:56 - people like ufc
67:57 - 205 reaction snooker and amazon fba
68:01 - business people like what the [ __ ] is
68:02 - going on
68:03 - programming and life in chicago after
68:05 - 2016 election
68:07 - so oh [ __ ] was that when trump became
68:10 - president
68:11 - i think so right so
68:15 - after that my views started going down
68:16 - i'm kidding so
68:18 - that's what you can see happen and there
68:20 - were a bunch of really weird videos i
68:22 - started making and then i got back
68:24 - on track with how to teach yourself to
68:27 - code
68:28 - free code camp learn python did python
68:32 - programming
68:32 - so wherever i got off track and started
68:34 - making random content you
68:36 - can see how it like just didn't provide
68:39 - any results and it kind of like sucked
68:42 - right i talk about coding and provide
68:44 - valuable tips 20 000 views i talk about
68:46 - some random stuff
68:47 - 540 views importance of finding a mentor
68:51 - 1 500 views
68:52 - so this is where like it really matters
68:55 - that you're
68:56 - talking about valuable stuff on a
68:58 - regular basis
69:04 - right i go to sql then the views go up i
69:06 - talk about coding
69:07 - views go up
69:13 - all right if you guys have more channels
69:15 - for me to
69:17 - uh rate i will go ahead and do that
69:22 - so just says decaf what's up
69:25 - so it just says decaf please so let's
69:28 - see what is happening here
69:35 - cool thumbnails actually right
69:40 - yeah like good thumbnails like seems
69:42 - like a good channel
69:43 - 189 subscribers it's a good sign
69:48 - [Music]
69:57 - [Music]
70:00 - and we're playing apex legends ranked
70:04 - okay i got my boy right here in case i
70:06 - think it would be really cool if i can
70:08 - see you
70:11 - what's good did you start it yeah i
70:14 - did buckle and this time the audience
70:18 - can hear you
70:19 - how about they can uh i'm just gonna
70:21 - make sure real quick
70:22 - just just give me a second let me just
70:23 - make sure real quick okay
70:25 - yeah do that do that all right so the
70:28 - start
70:29 - this is one thing i notice a lot with
70:31 - streaming and streamers and this is
70:32 - where i
70:33 - where they [ __ ] up a lot and this is
70:35 - what allowed
70:36 - my live streams to do really really well
70:40 - your start is one of your most important
70:42 - points if you have a poor start
70:45 - your replay value drops essentially to
70:47 - zero so then
70:49 - if you don't get views during the live
70:50 - you will never get more views on that
70:53 - video because
70:53 - the replay value is killed because the
70:56 - start is like
70:57 - the start is always like hello hello can
71:00 - you guys hear me
71:03 - can you guys oh is my mic on hey hey
71:06 - we're starting right now
71:09 - are we started yet cool cool
71:13 - all right um okay
71:16 - uh checking the audio are you guys
71:18 - hearing this hello
71:20 - okay cool cool cool all right bro all
71:22 - right
71:23 - so that is the number one way to kill
71:26 - your replay value because when i'm
71:28 - watching now like [ __ ] this like they're
71:29 - not prepared
71:30 - this is not gonna be good this is gonna
71:32 - be garbage and it's a waste of my time i
71:35 - i it's so much better if i just don't
71:36 - watch this and waste my time on it
71:39 - so the hack is just this man like like i
71:42 - know
71:43 - that what's holding you back there's a
71:45 - lot of like self confidence and self the
71:46 - same stuff too
71:48 - uh and you have to be careful about that
71:50 - and just work on it yourself
71:52 - you might be with a friend you're like
71:54 - if i try to sound professional my friend
71:56 - is going to make fun of me
71:57 - thinking that i'm like trying to be so
71:59 - official
72:00 - and so i might as well just play it cool
72:02 - and laugh it off so then when my friend
72:05 - says something i can just be like yeah i
72:06 - was just like joking you know like i
72:08 - wasn't really
72:09 - like commit to your [ __ ] videos so
72:11 - like next time it starts
72:13 - i want you to be like guys this is nova
72:16 - place
72:17 - and today we're gonna be playing apex
72:19 - legend season six
72:23 - intro it look at the [ __ ] camera and
72:25 - if you're gonna hide your face which i
72:27 - don't know why everybody's trying to
72:28 - hide their face like
72:29 - it's like um it's almost like some kind
72:33 - of like epidemic with
72:35 - lower self-esteem that is going on
72:37 - around the world
72:38 - and i want you guys to work on that
72:40 - because
72:41 - it will affect you in so many ways in
72:44 - the long run
72:45 - i want you to get confidence out of this
72:48 - that's what my number one thing
72:50 - is why i want you guys to get on camera
72:52 - show your face show your videos not just
72:54 - so your youtube channel does well
72:56 - so you improve your confidence your
72:58 - speaking ability because if you're
72:59 - hiding
73:00 - on a youtube video how many other places
73:03 - in your life
73:04 - are you hiding you're probably hiding at
73:06 - your work
73:07 - because you're scared to have the
73:08 - conversation you're scared to show your
73:11 - face you know in those meetings maybe
73:14 - when you're in a group of friends maybe
73:16 - you're not saying your joke
73:18 - or your punch line because you think
73:19 - nobody's gonna hear you
73:22 - maybe you're hiding in your relationship
73:24 - and not saying what you truly need to
73:26 - say and own up to your [ __ ]
73:29 - so it's not just you hide on a youtube
73:31 - video you're hiding in many [ __ ]
73:33 - other places
73:34 - and that's what that gives away when i
73:37 - watch your video
73:39 - so guys more confidence
73:43 - mental health is very important this is
73:45 - why i even like really appreciate
73:47 - olivia's channel because
73:48 - she talks about she's talking about
73:49 - mental health so
73:51 - self-esteem self-worth self-confidence
73:54 - extremely important
73:55 - people especially for streaming bro
73:57 - people don't watch your stream because
73:59 - of audio
74:00 - people don't watch your stream because
74:01 - of what game you're playing
74:03 - people watch or stream because of your
74:06 - personality and who you are
74:08 - the laziest people the
74:11 - the weirdest i've seen the weirdest
74:14 - people have big followings and streaming
74:16 - because people want to follow weird
74:18 - people but they just
74:20 - own it that they're [ __ ] weird the
74:23 - people who don't get followed are the
74:25 - people who don't
74:26 - show themselves or don't share their
74:28 - voice right like
74:29 - so i want to follow somebody who i can
74:31 - build a relationship with it's really
74:33 - hard for me to build a relationship with
74:34 - just
74:35 - voice don't know what you look like i
74:37 - don't know what you sound like i don't
74:38 - know who you are
74:39 - i can't read you like it's so much more
74:41 - entertaining when i can read your micro
74:42 - expressions if you're playing apex and
74:44 - you're like in trouble
74:45 - or you're like at a difficult level or
74:48 - you're playing with somebody and they're
74:49 - [ __ ] you up i want to see
74:50 - what happens in your expressions i'm
74:51 - going to see what happens when you're
74:52 - playing the game
74:54 - so um if you're especially streaming i
74:57 - think that's
74:58 - important the second thing is when the
75:00 - thing starts
75:01 - give a solid intro to what is happening
75:04 - as soon as you know you're live the
75:05 - second you hit live
75:06 - don't do the checking test test test
75:10 - don't do that just full this is nova
75:13 - place
75:13 - you're watching apex legends season six
75:16 - uh six ranked gold grind guys today
75:19 - we're gonna be grinding it out
75:22 - and i'm playing with one of my buddies
75:23 - and we're just going to go all
75:25 - in for you guys it's going to be super
75:26 - exciting i'm so glad you're here
75:28 - hit that like button so this video goes
75:30 - out to more people subscribe to the
75:31 - channel because we're going to be
75:32 - bringing you
75:33 - game play after gameplay and you're
75:34 - going to see us grind our faces off in
75:37 - apex legends
75:38 - all right let's roll and then just roll
75:40 - with your boy
75:41 - go right and start playing the game or
75:44 - whatever
75:45 - um so i think that will add
75:48 - a ton of replay value to your videos and
75:51 - then it will grow that way
75:54 - so i know it was probably not that light
75:56 - of a roast but
76:00 - all right matt short says roast me all
76:02 - right let's go to match short
76:09 - [Music]
76:14 - okay cool python short intro to python
76:17 - syntax
76:18 - i like it um
76:22 - five seconds in i think i would like it
76:24 - better if you even say it
76:28 - like with your voice
76:32 - but just keep in mind for intros
76:36 - long time so i recommend not having an
76:39 - intro just getting to it
76:40 - and then adding the intro later i
76:42 - recommend adding the intro later
76:44 - not the first possible thing hey
76:46 - everybody what's up how you doing today
76:48 - good energy very good energy hey so in
76:50 - this video
76:51 - uh we're going to talk about a little
76:52 - bit about python syntax
76:54 - and it's going to be a short
76:55 - introduction and i know trust me i can
76:58 - see the excitement on your face
76:59 - all the way through the internet so i'm
77:01 - gonna do these examples in idle which is
77:03 - python's integrated development
77:04 - and learning nice i like the joke i like
77:07 - that little like
77:09 - connection point i would like it even
77:11 - more i mean i feel like you got good
77:12 - personality i would like to see your
77:14 - face somewhere
77:15 - environment and here you can see it over
77:16 - here on my screen and if you're coming
77:18 - to python from another language the
77:19 - first thing you'll probably notice is
77:21 - that python statements don't have an any
77:22 - delimiter
77:23 - meaning some languages have some i like
77:25 - that you even edited it make it made it
77:27 - punchier that's
77:28 - really good thank you for that some kind
77:30 - of symbol to signal to the computer that
77:32 - they've reached
77:33 - line so we could just write something as
77:35 - simply as
77:36 - you uploaded this today great uh the
77:39 - only thing is
77:39 - why is it unlisted bro make this public
77:42 - this is awesome
77:44 - print
77:51 - and then it's indented four spaces and
77:52 - we'll get to the indents in a minute
77:54 - but for right now i just want you to
77:55 - understand that the code blocks each
77:57 - start with a semicolon or i'm sorry a
77:59 - colon
78:00 - and then into the block so we can say
78:03 - cool
78:06 - a varying different amount of spaces you
78:08 - got it
78:09 - you got this if you don't stop
78:12 - and you keep putting out content your
78:13 - channel will grow
78:15 - channel will grow everything we have
78:18 - you don't need to put your face unless
78:20 - you want to
78:22 - um you know
78:27 - [Music]
78:29 - it's a cool intro but i would i would
78:31 - start it off first and then intro it i
78:33 - think the things you can improve
78:35 - is add your face in the start what's up
78:38 - guys today we're gonna be
78:39 - giving you a short intro to python let's
78:41 - roll the intro and boom
78:42 - the intro then rolls so like imagine
78:45 - right
78:46 - how many seconds is that so what's up
78:49 - guys
78:50 - what's up guys today we're going to be
78:51 - talking about python let's roll the
78:53 - intro
78:54 - so that's about three to four seconds
78:57 - right
78:57 - when i counted it's about three to four
78:59 - seconds
79:00 - roll then turn three to four seconds and
79:02 - then boom
79:03 - get into the video i would make the
79:05 - intro even shorter try to get the intro
79:07 - like really really really short if you
79:09 - can
79:10 - just because it's it's not the best use
79:13 - of somebody's time
79:15 - um and yeah so
79:19 - that i think is gonna be good i think if
79:21 - you improve your audio quality so
79:23 - there's less background sound i think
79:24 - that will improve
79:25 - i'm liking that you're editing this
79:27 - that's a real that's really good too
79:30 - just a bit all right we'll save that so
79:33 - in this video
79:33 - uh we're gonna talk about a little bit
79:35 - about python but if you keep going with
79:37 - this you will grow
79:39 - so good job great work you put a
79:43 - put up a video i'm i'm happy
79:46 - roast me alive all right cool let's see
79:49 - who
79:50 - else is there test run um
79:53 - what type of roast are you looking for
79:55 - jesus
79:56 - [Music]
79:59 - if you don't say anything then i'm just
80:00 - gonna roast
80:04 - [Music]
80:05 - hey what's up chief yo
80:08 - the best audio quality so far now
80:12 - this is the first setup this is not
80:14 - gonna be
80:15 - you guys notice that right when the
80:17 - audio is right
80:18 - it just comp million times the
80:20 - difference like
80:21 - i would sacrifice video quality over
80:24 - audio even though youtube is a video
80:26 - platform
80:27 - i actually put sixty percent of the
80:29 - effort uh emphasis on audio
80:32 - and 40 of it on actually video so you
80:35 - guys notice that right
80:36 - as soon as this audio is good you're
80:38 - kind of hooked and you want to know
80:39 - what's happening
80:41 - in actual video of
80:44 - um that i'm going to put on youtube this
80:46 - is just a test
80:47 - run video and
80:51 - basically what i'm going to do with this
80:53 - is going to be like a trial and error
80:55 - i want to you know play a lot play with
80:58 - this
80:58 - two recordings because i'm using two
81:00 - cameras oh [ __ ] son
81:02 - most luckily i have two of the same kind
81:05 - and i'm gonna you know pull put this
81:11 - all right he's ready to blow up make
81:13 - sure your comments are turned on bro
81:14 - don't turn comments off because of
81:16 - insecurity i mean i don't know if you
81:18 - did that or if it automatically
81:20 - bro i'm gonna um mess around with the
81:23 - lighting i'm gonna mess around with the
81:24 - sound
81:25 - also and uh i'm going to send it to you
81:28 - hopefully you see
81:29 - you see this video and you know you can
81:31 - give me some good
81:33 - um criticism some good try to
81:37 - so uh a simple hack i'll tell you to
81:39 - improve the video
81:41 - so video is like 90 about lighting if
81:44 - you can get the lighting right the video
81:46 - just solves itself
81:48 - very few times you truly have to upgrade
81:49 - to a new camera
81:52 - um when you have light behind you that's
81:55 - a bad idea
81:57 - you should sit facing the other way so
82:00 - that light coming from that window
82:01 - points to you i wouldn't put
82:04 - more light behind me because now
82:08 - i'm paying more attention here than your
82:10 - face
82:12 - so if you sat the other way where if you
82:14 - turned around and were looking out the
82:16 - window
82:17 - and then you had the camera pointing to
82:20 - you from there
82:21 - then your face would be really lit up
82:23 - and i'd be able to see you a lot better
82:25 - and then it would like look much better
82:30 - uh second thing is i think there's a lot
82:34 - of like
82:34 - extra headspace so i would move the
82:38 - frame down so your head is like close to
82:40 - touching this
82:41 - more but outside of that brother i think
82:43 - if you make content that's valuable and
82:45 - you give valuable tips or suggest
82:47 - suggestions because i'm using two
82:49 - cameras you're
82:50 - on a winning you're about to win because
82:53 - you got
82:53 - good setup you have a good voice you
82:56 - have a great personality
82:58 - good confidence if you give valuable
83:00 - stuff and keep going you will
83:02 - grow a channel out of this
83:08 - radion says he's like owen cook right
83:10 - yeah kind of
83:14 - uh shubham says roast me if you can all
83:17 - right
83:18 - let's go youtube
83:21 - roast javascript here we go
83:26 - so hello guys this is welcome to the
83:28 - channel one of it
83:29 - so ask my video functions and functions
83:34 - nice good i like it
83:38 - in javascript or any other programming
83:40 - language so guys let's start the video
83:43 - nice that is great good audio quality
83:47 - good that
83:48 - he gives you what this is gonna be about
83:50 - and then he rolls the intro this dude
83:53 - respects my time
83:54 - i respect him back there's a reason why
83:56 - he has 16 to zero
83:57 - like the dislike ratio programming
83:59 - language and he already has things up
84:03 - he's already even giving you an insight
84:05 - into what's going to be happening in the
84:07 - video
84:08 - so guys let's start the video
84:12 - cool intro
84:29 - i speak urdu as well fluently um i mean
84:32 - you're speaking hindi
84:33 - but they're very similar hindi or do so
84:36 - i like the hindi and english
84:38 - mix mix and match that's pretty cool i
84:40 - speak with my family like that because
84:42 - i'm fluent in urdu
84:44 - uh slash hindi i'm and i'm fluent in
84:46 - english obviously so
84:47 - this is a cool way to do it and you're
84:50 - just keeping you're very
84:51 - clean and to the point so that's really
84:52 - good
84:54 - for example alert
85:03 - this is the first channel i've seen that
85:05 - is clean
85:06 - like when it comes to hindi and urdu
85:08 - most of the times it's like
85:11 - most of them they're not clean it's just
85:13 - like really weird
85:14 - people talking and sort of really weird
85:17 - videos
85:18 - this is like a clean video it's almost
85:20 - like it's literally a channel that was
85:21 - made in u.s and it's like banging
85:24 - but now you just mixed hindi with it and
85:26 - you're off to the races
85:28 - so this is gonna do well i think
85:32 - um i would improve the thumbnails i
85:35 - don't know why you have 7
85:36 - 8 9 10 numbers in there like i would
85:39 - not have those uh
85:43 - yeah i wouldn't have numbers like most
85:44 - of your views will come from somebody
85:46 - new
85:47 - right so somebody news coming in they
85:49 - don't care about your numbers
85:51 - most people watch videos based on
85:55 - what is in their home feed and
85:56 - recommended right
85:58 - so if i see a two um it will actually
86:01 - make me
86:02 - even really less likely to click on it
86:03 - what the [ __ ] is happening it's part two
86:05 - of something i don't wanna watch it
86:06 - because i probably haven't even seen
86:08 - part one
86:10 - so i would recommend um
86:15 - yeah more thumbnails like that i think
86:17 - that's good
86:19 - this one is too much it's kind of ugly
86:21 - it's just too much text
86:23 - this is a good thumbnail
86:26 - this is cool
86:29 - and then yeah let's click on your most
86:32 - popular videos
86:35 - oh nice web development in 100 seconds
86:37 - let's take a look at this
86:39 - 48 0 this has got to be pretty good
86:41 - let's see
86:43 - so hello guys and welcome to the

88:29 - other things like what kind of product
88:30 - or service
88:31 - you might be able to sell day four we're
88:34 - gonna plan out your first
88:35 - million dollars with youtube this is

89:47 - seconds he told me what the [ __ ] we're
89:49 - gonna be doing
89:51 - that's so cool the only thing that would
89:53 - improve this is if i could
89:55 - see the actual store in the first six
89:58 - seconds like
89:58 - i think it would be a lot cooler if you
90:00 - didn't have any of this

91:46 - something's up with the audio i don't
91:47 - like the audio we installed it too
91:49 - yeah audio is a problem okay so the on
91:51 - the light roast and
91:53 - audio is the number one problem i see
91:55 - with this video outside of it
91:56 - a lot of the things i really really like
91:59 - i like the energy
92:00 - hi baby thank you so i like the energy
92:03 - i like how you look in this i like the
92:06 - tutorial
92:06 - another way i'll i want to see if this
92:09 - video is going to be a good video as i
92:10 - skim through it so if i skim through it
92:12 - and there are a lot of visual changes
92:14 - happening
92:15 - to me that is a sign of a really
92:17 - entertaining and interesting video
92:19 - when i skim through it and nothing
92:20 - changes i'm like oh this video is going
92:22 - to suck
92:22 - and usually it sucks so that's really
92:26 - good
92:28 - on the the best thing i like about it
92:30 - that you can never go wrong with is
92:31 - true value in this video if you go
92:34 - through it you actually build a store
92:37 - when you deliver that type of value even
92:40 - if your content's quality is not the
92:42 - best
92:42 - it will perform well so on that end i
92:45 - feel like you are completely on the
92:47 - right track
92:48 - i love your stuff so you already
92:50 - commented nice
92:52 - all right yep so

93:04 - got money so just invest into a short
93:06 - sm7b like if you really want to go next
93:08 - level
93:08 - and get a road caster pro with it or if
93:11 - you i mean
93:12 - you'll be fine with yeti bro yeti is
93:14 - really good i grew my entire channel
93:16 - clever programmer and yeti so

93:36 - sm7b cool
93:39 - uh dope dope dope like the contrast
93:43 - visual's changing very attention
93:44 - grabbing yes
93:45 - so it's a really good sign of when you
93:48 - see things
93:49 - changing i'll give you like when i know
93:52 - a video is going to be a banger i just
93:54 - make it i
93:55 - dial it in like crazy so if you can dial
93:58 - your video in like crazy you're going to
94:00 - succeed so let me go to our most popular
94:02 - videos
94:03 - and you'll see how dialed in they
94:05 - actually are
94:06 - so let's click this one top five
94:08 - programming languages to learn in 2020
94:11 - top five programming languages for you
94:14 - to learn
94:14 - in 2020 how long did
94:18 - it take for me to deliver the
94:19 - information regarding what this video is
94:21 - going to be about guys how long did that
94:23 - take
94:27 - right if you think about that it took
94:29 - very little time
94:31 - right it took about five seconds top
94:33 - five programming languages
94:35 - or even less like in one or two seconds
94:37 - you know what's gonna be happening for
94:38 - you to learn
94:39 - in 2020 to get a job without
94:42 - even needing a college degree i make a
94:46 - video on this topic
94:47 - every single year and you guys seem to
94:51 - eat it up a video i made in 2018 got
94:54 - over two million views
94:55 - this is called social proofing so i'm
94:57 - referring to a previous
94:59 - like this is a little bit more advanced
95:01 - but can i share some advanced tips with
95:03 - you guys too
95:05 - um so this
95:08 - is like a little bit more advanced but
95:09 - it's called social proofing so i'm
95:11 - throwing social proof
95:12 - to what i'd done in the past and how we
95:14 - did because that creates more
95:16 - uh social proof so then people are like
95:18 - oh this guy is going to be good or this
95:20 - video is going to be good if the
95:21 - previous one got 2 million and another
95:23 - one i made in 2019 uh over
95:25 - 1 million views i just want to say thank
95:28 - you so much i love your beauty
95:30 - so this is like a call back to like this
95:32 - is kind of like for my subscribers and
95:34 - super fans just thanking them
95:35 - new videos we are going to be ranking
95:38 - the programming languages
95:39 - on three main factors number one
95:43 - the time it takes for you to learn even
95:46 - if you're a complete
95:47 - so i'm changing my framing quite a bit
95:49 - just to keep it entertaining and moving
95:51 - i know if i nail the first minute i'm
95:54 - gonna [ __ ] keep you for the rest of
95:56 - it i know that
95:57 - so that that is why the first minute is
95:59 - so important if you can
96:01 - tightly pack it and script it and go
96:04 - you really have a chance for your videos
96:06 - to blow up beginner
96:08 - and make real world projects number two
96:11 - the job market what is the demand and
96:14 - the overall
96:15 - salary that you what is your overall
96:17 - productive or own
96:19 - and when your applications youtube
96:21 - algorithm it's been destroyed
96:23 - here's another pro hack ask for a like
96:27 - when you ask for a like you will get
96:29 - million times more likes right
96:31 - how about this 130 000 likes
96:35 - who here would like 130 000 likes on
96:37 - their video
96:38 - who here would like 1.7 million views on
96:40 - their video
96:42 - so the key is to ask for it and if you
96:46 - can make it an entertaining way and at
96:48 - the right time not just in the start
96:49 - like the first dude whose videos we saw
96:51 - i was like what the [ __ ] is this he's
96:52 - not looking at the camera and he's like
96:54 - he's like i want you to it's like
96:56 - looking off into the sunset and he's
96:58 - like i want you to
97:00 - go to every video of mine and just leave
97:02 - a comment every single video and he's
97:05 - like like
97:05 - every single video nobody's gonna
97:07 - [ __ ] do that because they don't care
97:10 - and you can't ask without giving them
97:13 - something entertaining i've already
97:14 - entertained you i've already gotten your
97:16 - attention
97:17 - you're already here for one minute so i
97:18 - can actually ask you now
97:20 - to smash the like button and watch how i
97:22 - do this here
97:23 - enough time by the way i would love if
97:25 - you help me beat the youtube algorithm
97:27 - it's been destroying my channel
97:29 - if you want to help me do that smash
97:31 - that like button
97:32 - like no like really just go and destroy
97:35 - that like button okay right now
97:39 - please subscribe that hack right there
97:42 - blew this video up because if your video
97:44 - is getting liked
97:46 - youtube sends it out to more and more
97:48 - people it just spreads
97:49 - out so fast back to the channel if you
97:52 - haven't already and let's keep going
97:55 - right and then let's keep going so i say
97:57 - that i make that ask at one minute 18
97:59 - seconds because you already i gave you
98:01 - enough for you
98:02 - to keep your 118. boom i make the ask it
98:05 - takes me 15 seconds for it and right
98:07 - after that
98:08 - boom we're rolling into the video what's
98:10 - up guys this is kazzy from
98:12 - cleverprogrammer.com now before we get
98:14 - into the meat and potatoes of this video
98:16 - and we talk about different languages
98:17 - there are multiple programming languages
98:19 - where you can make over a hundred
98:21 - thousand dollars a year before we get
98:23 - into
98:24 - all right so now after that we get
98:25 - really advanced and i'm gonna talk about
98:27 - that over the next few days not here
98:29 - because
98:30 - there's an email list building strategy
98:32 - and there's like a lot of stuff
98:34 - happening okay so we're gonna talk about
98:35 - that on day three day four and day five
98:38 - uh so those those get more advanced
98:41 - we're gonna just keep it one thing at a
98:43 - time
98:44 - but if you go through the video i mean
98:46 - it's a great video it's a very
98:48 - visually appealing entertaining punchy
98:52 - uh we're gonna be making another one top
98:54 - five for 2021 so watch out for that that
98:56 - one is gonna bang
98:58 - that one is gonna my that one's probably
99:00 - gonna bang harder than this because now
99:01 - we have the knowledge of our past
99:04 - with our like the what we know about now
99:14 - all right me beautiful love the percent
99:17 - of confidence kazi thank you
99:19 - olivia yes um
99:23 - how long does it take you to edit these
99:24 - awesome videos this video took a really
99:26 - really long time
99:29 - all right cool awesome guys with that
99:31 - said i want you guys
99:33 - to put on your phones or wherever in
99:36 - your calendar make sure you have

Cleaned transcript:

excited to be here with you guys today and we're going to be talking about this is day two of the youtube challenge and we're going to be talking about how can you break your first 1 000 subscribers and how did i get to let's see over here lifetime i'm taking you behind analytics how did i get to 836 000 subscribers on youtube and we're going to talk about your first 1000 all right that's the part that's actually really really important so we're going to be getting into it in just a little bit first of all if you guys are here and you're excited drop it in the comments below let me know if you guys are pumped up about this and we are going to be getting into this right away all right so i'm gonna pop open the facebook group if you guys want to be in this challenge the uh this is day two of the challenge where what we're really working on here is helping you start your own youtube channel and helping you get the same freedom financial freedom and impact that i was able to have with clever programmer and now what i want to do is i want to work with you guys to figure out like help you guys start your own youtube channels and make that impact because for me the impact is what is addictive for me what's addictive is taking a look at this and going oh man we provided value to 34 million people oh man we have helped the world move forward by 2.6 million hours which comes down to about i think like over a few hundred years right we help the world move forward so that to me is exciting and i feel like if we do this together and we help the world move forward that is the biggest fastest way to make an impact and it doesn't matter if you're a developer it doesn't matter if you're somebody who is into cooking it doesn't matter if you're somebody who's into like nighttime stories it doesn't really matter right we want to be able to help everybody with this and so i'm excited a few things i want to share with you guys is the best way for me to give you value because this is live is for me to get your questions and for us to engage and have a back and forth i think that is the way i can deliver the most amount of value so if you ask questions that make them good my team is going to be taking out those questions and they're going to be putting those questions in my slack i'll be able to see them and then i can actually address all those questions and concerns that you guys um have so let me go here i'm refreshing the facebook group and i want to see it who's on this live okay beautiful so we are live in the facebook group man 29 people hopefully we'll get on more people here joey says i'm a musician and a drawing artist all right we got people watching on youtube as well beautiful amazing guys awesome all right so uh we got joey we got zephyr we got hafiz fernando from mexico let's go i'll bring this up here as well all right let's click into this guys yesterday was crazy like when we went live it was absolutely insane the live stream that we had we got so many comments on that live stream it was kind of ridiculous what i don't even know where that stream went though can't find that stream but good thing that this stream is on so let's keep going ricardo says me here i'm excited joey said let's go day two gabby says yo hello so glad to see your beautiful face all right guys so let's get into this now i'm gonna go back and i think the best way i can share this with you is how did i get my first 1000 subscribers right and i just want to kind of recap this i want to talk about how i went from zero to 8300 subscribers i want to talk about how i went from zero to over 30 million views and i'm going to talk about how i went at the age of 26 from zero to 2.6 million dollars under the age of 26. for me the catalyst that allowed me to change my life you know a boy from pakistan who came here and had nothing and completely transformed is because youtube allowed me to help and make a big impact in other people's lives that as a result led to a lot of other people's financial freedom just from viewing our youtube content for free and led to my financial freedom and our teams because we gave value to the world we got value back it's just as simple as that and i want to help you guys do the same thing so i'm going to show you guys what the journey in the start like entailed let's go here beautiful how do i click it for where okay got it okay comments oh wait i can just make it full screen like this okay cool there we go all right beautiful so there we go now i'm able to see um all your guys's comments and everything that's going on that way i can address everything all right beautiful guys so um i want to show you guys what it took for me to actually get my first 1 000 subscribers so i'm going to kind of get into that let's go to 2016 and i'm going to show you guys right here so i was at 472 subscribers in my first 10 months right if you take a look at that in my first 10 months oh that's a great question and i'll address that too dixon asked all right now let me go to just a little bit ahead of this so i can show you guys where what it was that i got my very first thousand subscribers let's go here boom hit it 5 000 subscribers okay by december so i imagine it happened right in december and we're gonna go here and we're gonna move it down to let's say december 2nd see what happens yep and let's go december 3rd i want to get to the exact date boom exactly december 3rd was when i got the first thousand subscribers and then everything just took off so you guys can see here 1 000 subscribers and the date is about you know this was a 10 month long journey all the way from march to december let me ask you guys would you guys be interested in finding out how you can get your first 1 000 subscribers would that be something that would be exciting to you you teaching people what you know or what you love or what you want to share and then people following you for it and then getting on that journey and then at some point like following you and you know even you're able to then make a living would you guys want to learn how to be able to do that thomas says kudos thank you brother i appreciate it all right beautiful so a lot of people i know started their youtube channels yesterday which was really exciting um and if we can find the yesterday's stream then i can probably even go through is it yesterday's facebook yeah it's gone yes all announcements um are you able to just give me a link in slack okay thank you all right cool so i'm gonna take your guys's question matt says hell yeah carol says yeah beautiful raul nice critic says did this today critic made a youtube video let me actually check that out wow this is so hi everyone it's kritik here from criticism makes you look professional like to make sure you're like for as little as 370 hmm okay cool um so all right critic good video a few important things one i think look at the camera you come in i want you to comment on my each and every okay so you're wanting too many things but you're not giving me enough value and then it seems like you're trying to sell me something also i would use your voice like i wouldn't recommend like speech to texting because as a human being i don't want to deal with a robot right like i actually want to deal with a human being not a robot so that's important anora yes this meeting is being recorded uh okay great so here's a question that we got so i'll bring this up by dixon he says hey what do you recommend on social media accounts before i become a developer i was posting anything on my facebook twitter and instagram do i delete all start afresh or how do i go about it so never delete anything ever i mean unless it's like really something horrible that you put up that you know it's either you're discriminating against somebody or it's hate speech or bullying or if it's not a violent sin or a crime never delete anything always just move forward before i become before i become a developer i was posting anything on facebook yeah so all you need to do dixon is just keep sharing the part of the journey that you're at that's all so when it comes to like making a youtube or making a facebook or making a twitter or an instagram it's all about just sharing the part of the journey where you were at all right that's it and then you just go forward that's everything you don't need to go beyond that okay if you then want to go to the next level and really truly focus on providing value for people making content for them you can do that as well but in the start if you just document your journey and what is happening in your life you're good all right let's see if we have more questions all right we got yesterday's live that sick because that means that um i can give you guys feedback on your videos like look at this this is insane 907 comments thank you guys for that that is huge this is my latest video so let's check out ricardo's video it's a pretty cool start oh [ __ ] damn boy that's nice um i would say something here because i'm not understanding what is going on so far and there's a lot of time being wasted on this like still frame that's not moving still you're not talking to me about what's going on okay i see what's happening so it's just like you're showing the park okay um it's not entertaining because i get to watch the park but it's kind of like your dad making a video of like a park with a cell phone and just like sending it to you and you're like dad what are you doing so the reason why this channel isn't breaking a thousand subscribers is because it's just footage it's just like random almost like stock footage so that's not gonna blow up unless it's truly just like an 8k resolution and like the best thing on the planet to watch you know so here what would make this entertaining is a voice over you know a story behind this park or why is this park so valuable why should people go to it context behind this i think that would make it entertaining to watch and in the start i wouldn't waste so much time on this because the start is where it's the most important so if you can't get people past your start you're not going to get people much farther than that all right cool nice i see people are now dropping their things cool cool cool i didn't get a notification yeah it's kind of sad i don't know like why we we weren't able to send you guys an email for some reason um and you know like we sent the text to you guys and hopefully that got you guys here but yeah i apologize about that we have coding paradise and he wants feedback on his last videos let's take a look at it nice yo yo yo what's up this is gilberto from calling paradise my youtube channel and i am a man with one only one mission to teach people how to program and i want to thank cassie from clever programming yo yo nice and well if you're interested see you soon beautiful okay awesome i have a surprise for you guys um on days like day six of the challenge where i'm gonna be announcing something really special um we're gonna be launching our like i'm gonna be launching a youtube program and i can't wait to share that with you guys and we're gonna go into all kinds of details in that now in this here what i'm seeing with coding paradise this is a you have a really engaging personality you're very like entertaining and i actually found it funny like especially here program from one only one i like it you're very happy and smiling i love that uh again make sure you look at the camera most people are usually always looking at themselves in the screen so like don't look down here make sure you're looking at the camera people um it makes a big difference okay so make sure you look at the camera yo what's up this is gilbert hernandez nice dude you're gonna be good if you keep going you got good titles you got a good thumbnail and you got music you're looking right at the camera and this one and talking paradise and today we are going to install visual studio code okay there are a lot of code editors out there and i think the best one is visual studio code so let's keep looking at the camera we are here in google chrome you can use whatever you want and we search for visual code okay so we enter to you can download it everywhere you can choose here the pot and you enjoy it make sure to subscribe if you like and next video we will see ya bro you got a future bro you got a future with this [ __ ] keep making content your thumbnail game is down way better than mine way better than when i started i mean now my game is pretty good but right that's good even nas is like sitting there he's like that's really good so thumbnail is good the title of the video is great your presentation of it when it starts is great um you have a very like unique charismatic engaging personality which i like so keep using that to your advantage i would go i would go all all in bro i would go all in i would just make more content and you're gonna only get better with time all right so i love i love this bro nice job let's see uh more people i tried to improve my video based on your guys feedback what do you guys think kristen said hello guys and welcome to a new video on this channel oh [ __ ] son dude oh wait was that you yesterday game trips are festivals and build a community and it's very important oh wait i'm not showing it i'm looking for clients or if you're developing a game by your own and want to publish it hey los angeles nice bro all right let's take a look at this i also want yo if you're in los angeles you should come hit us up because we're looking for developers who want to create content a clever programmer publish it as a kind of portfolio for ios device this is your best video so far i can tell you that this out my games but today i want to talk about some great news as well okay um unity also but that's the new macbook yet and you kind of lost him but i don't know what's happening anymore made out of it there's only one project okay i lost you're lost me uh and don't do that that's a weird intro like stop using so much text use your voice keep it simple simplicity is better okay so watch peter mckinnon like peter mckinnon and watch him um when his [ __ ] starts shit's simple okay so let me go to this one what's up everybody peter mckinnon here welcome back to yet another video today we're reacting to the recently aired apple event cinematography not the product so there right like that is extremely clean start uh you're like using way too much text which is like annoying as a viewer to see it hello guys and welcome to uv yeah i can actually do live streams like this like just sit there on twitch and [ __ ] and have people like give me your youtube channels right like literally i can sit there for [ __ ] eight hours giving feedback hey yeah that is that's really exciting um okay so yeah i i don't understand what's happening it to me just seems like you just put this clip and then you just like start saying really random stuff over it video in times 20 where i create or develop an app for myself and i also want to publish it as a kind of portfolio for ios devices i'm actually so impressed what they made out of it like the new mac so much better like i like where you're going with this you're talking about the macbook talking about this but like why not just show your face then like why is the code like maybe the code could have been cool showing for like two seconds but then it should cut to your face and you should be talking um like i don't know why i'm looking at code i'm like am i trying to follow this code i'm trying am i am i making this app but it doesn't seem like it it just seems like you have like something playing and then it's almost like it's just in the background and then you just have a voiceover on it which is like completely it's not very it's not relevant at all like your image and what you're talking about has no relevance to each other it's almost like if you came to my coding channel and i had zebras running and i was like talking about like apple ios or something crazy so i would say that i would just show your face and i would just sit there and talk in front of the camera like you can do that another thing is you're very low energy dude you're very like chill and like low energy which there's nothing wrong with but your strength is then um then you got to sit there and edit your video you got to make it tight i'm wasting a lot of time between guys i think um your ios is pretty good and then if you have thoughts and you're going to speak them in a low energy way then you need to use editing to keep the pace up cut every single like pause out keep the pace up increase the volume on it and don't drown out don't make music compete with you your music right now is competing or almost louder than your actual video you think for me for now i just would say that right the music is so loud i can barely hear it you enjoy the quick programming in the background as ios developers and doesn't matter if you do it with swift directly or to unity also it's for yes so there's coding going on so i'm looking at coding and paying attention to coding there's loud music and then your voice is very low the three things are completely separate from each other and they're competing they're all competing for my attention there's very little of anything i can pay attention to focus keep your [ __ ] simple um look at the camera and talk if you have to talk if it's going to be a talking video have graphics or broll come over it to support like your main point whatever point it is that you're trying to make right when you're talking about unity maybe a graphic of unity comes up if you're talking about c sharp or ios apps their logo pops up if you're then talking about their commissions the commission thing pops up right if you have trouble with editing use slides just literally use google slides and do it you guys can crush it with just google slides not even show your face have slides that'll keep you on script and then just like have images in each slide and then just talk about them and just keep going so that's another way of doing it uh great cool cool cool all right let's keep going it's the beginning i'm looking at your guys's comments okay cool yep kristen you can you can i'm glad you can improve a lot bro yeah i'm i'm glad that you're not taking it personally and you're actually using the feedback it's going to help you tremendously uh background music keep it very low like juan is asking uh crap let's bring it right here and let's bring that right here okay cool so juan is asking hey what about um background noise should i have that in my music or or should i have that in my tutorial or or no i would say that keep it very low keep the background noise music very low during tutorials very low almost like you cannot hear it and in the start keep it high so the energy is high and it's like what's up this is one music is going and then it just like starts to vanish as time progresses okay uh beautiful so yuri says my video will be out tomorrow i love that i'm the amadeus says can you give me feedback okay so let's go here and see if we can give him feedback so welcome to my channel i have decided to take part in a 5day quiz challenge so i have done thousands of ecommerce courses and for the year i've been doing this on the alligator platform in poland so now i decided to switch to shopify and increase my possibilities so guys i love ecommerce and i want to share this love for you guys for you with you so now what will be my strategy and purpose of this channel i will i want to inspire you that age it doesn't matter on this field so if you only have a vision and dream everything is possible so something weird is happening to me in this video i'm like almost getting hypnotized watching it so who i will follow it's extremely important to learn from people it's like a mixture between like ecommerce asmr and hypnosis you are where you want to be guys i have a question for you do you want to what to go to your destination in a fiat multipla or for ferrari both will get you to your destination but at what time so ask yourself what is your choice but my choice is of course i want to be in ferrari so [ __ ] multipla and let's go regarding fbs is the mass of the course who teaching it i made thousands of them in total in poland such as pl etc etc no one of them could match the value he gave for free kevin zhang so on this challenge i will follow his instruction and his setup for a facebook ads i know that's worked because he made over 20 million dollars from this what's happening oh wow oh i can't wait to see julio's where on youtube or where in facebook group um so okay so basically for this what i'm gonna say is um it's uh there's something really weird bro here that's going on here it's very entertaining to me i don't know why like i kind of wanted to just keep listening like i feel hypnotized to listen i don't know it's really amusing to me in some weird way um i think because this is not an audio platform and it's a video platform have if you're not going to have your face at least have like google slides and just have a presentation so then images move here so as you're talking it goes to the next slide and the slide after that and slide after that uh so i think it could be a really interesting channel and just and just the energy you have man is like it's kind of it's it's kind of magnetic so keep going like i i kind of like in a really weird way believe in this uh but yeah that's those are my thoughts on it just produce more give it some structure and then have slides or something that visually moves broll stock image and then actually give valuable stuff and and keep going might be a weird channel it just blows up all right we got julio in the house let's go julio let's see what you got brother and guys is it okay if i can get like brutally honest with you guys like is it okay if i start roasting people and [ __ ] what are you guys okay with what do you guys accept time to roast julio that'd be fun bro right yeah i mean that'd be fun i would love to roast other people's code yeah imagine like if i'm the simon cowell like oh the youtube roaster bro for eight hours a day live oh [ __ ] oh man i don't have a appreciation all right guys so let's talk about breaking your first 1000 subscribers right so one thing you guys saw was the mindset it requires and right now we're just going into and breaking down what it is that you guys need help with in the meantime guys if you're getting value out of this make sure to turn off your phones lock in this is day two of the challenge by day five you will have your own youtube channel by day five you will be on track to being able to have financial freedom on day five you'll have a fullon blueprint to be able to create whatever it is that you were dreaming about or grow in a successful way so if that excites you make sure you're locked in make sure you're committed drop in the comments below i'm [ __ ] committed and let's go all right so i'm excited let's um let's go ahead and take a look at this video intro the start of my new youtube journey nice so just looking at this channel so far the only video i want to watch is this one i don't want to watch any of these other ones the reason is this is just weird but that's okay don't delete anything um this i'm not sure could be pretty good but the title is not it means anything to me and then here this one i also have no idea what's going on so i'm not going to click on it this one looks like a youtuber's video so i want to you know and i would take away the word intro i would just call it the start of my new youtube journey i think that'd be cool and let's click on it and watch what is happening uh julio says i just posted an intro for accountability so no music or cuts but i play with the vlog format a lot would love to know if you have any suggestions for me talking to the camera and because i know uh julio he's on my instagram i love his energy so i think this vlog is gonna be pretty uh entertaining and he should keep doing this but let's go guys let's get things started hey already it's like a good youtube video all right i'm excited so we're not in the weird territory anymore so as i said on my instagram i've decided to start a youtube channel pretty soon so this isn't actually gonna be my first video it's just gonna be an introduction of what it is that i'm planning on showing or what content i'm planning on creating rewarded uh based on their importance we can actually uh we can actually rank our importance it's a public rank where the artist knows who we are as fans and then can reward us personally so that i help you now when you're small and you're emerging you buy equipment make it in the industry i help you promote and then if you make it then maybe you can return to me with some rewards knowing that i'm your top one two three or f fifth fan right anyway so that started and i really really wanted to see and yeah and what i think i know okay so my thoughts on this is it's a good video i know that you did it just kind of like to do it um i would like if you look at me more and talk to me more um like in the start it felt very warm and like almost like you care for me and then here it feels a little cold like you don't care about me you're just like telling me what you do that you're good at or something like that um outside of that i think that this is a really great channel i think that if you keep putting out content i think it will work for you you have a really good personality you have good communication skills so i would push harder on it for you i recommend learn video editing spend time i think you're a fast dude i think you learn quick uh you have very high energy so your videos will bang your energy combined with learning editing and storytelling whatever it is you're trying to do you can do it faster by being able to have those skills so love it julio all right stacy sent me something so let's go ahead and take a look at that what is happening here um so i'm not sure what's happening here but it is fun music um okay this is a brand new channel for showcasing project oriented programming okay we share replit and github thanks for watching okay cool i would give it some kind of face or some kind of direction because right now it seems very faceless and generic and random and almost like a almost like a computer generated this video doesn't even seem like a human generated this video so um also i don't really understand what is happening here like i don't get it discover why our customers love pop code maker nobody cares because nobody knows about a pop code maker uh so you have to find a way to make me care you have to find like nobody cares about your stuff at all like nobody's here to watch your stuff about you and what you offer there's never a video where it's just like you guys come in like for coding right i can't just drop a video on my thing it's like come to our service profit with javascript profit with javascript you get oneonone coaching you got oneonone coaching and it's just like tries to hypnotize you buy our product there's no video like that because we know if we made it it would get like two views even though we have a channel with 830 000 subscribers nobody cares about our stuff for us people want to watch stuff that they want to watch that will be actually entertaining to them so make stuff that's um ha guys get rid of this like nonhuman [ __ ] that people are doing like put a [ __ ] face in there if you're scared like get unscared and just put your face in there talk look at the camera just some normal like human communication skills like i think are really important guys so i think it's one of the best ways to grow your channel all right beautiful miriam says yesterday i didn't follow the stream but i'm here now so i'm going to shoot on saturday 20 7 pm edit on sunday beautiful exciting exciting all right let's see joey you're up joey oh i got a good feeling about this one joey um this will do well if you're modeling channels you know that's a good idea i think that your fastest way to blowing up is ticktock i've seen [ __ ] like this on ticktock and ig reels blow up so i would say focus on that and then funnel people to these youtube videos and i think that'll be your fastest way to grow especially guys when you don't add your personality into it it's really hard to like grow it on youtube you know like i think one big thing that you can do is just by simply adding your personality in here and you now got a much better chance of winning on this platform all right cool uh julio says nobody thank you boss and yes i'll get to editing on my first video soon beautiful uh we got muktum here let's take a look at what's happening all right you're already wasting a lot of my time still wasting my time hey guys cool this

much for supporting for that happy news i am going to introduce you one more topic which okay then information nice that is the data okay cool so i love it you're providing very valuable information and then you get through it so technical videos like this is always will always work will always always always work you can't go wrong with like technical power points that's like one proven method of success the only way i would improve this video is what happens in the first 15 to 20 seconds i would instead i would instead do the video like this what's up guys today we're going to be talking about computer basics and we're going to be breaking down what is a computer electronically what is a keyboard and how does it work what is this i would give the hook and the what's included in this video in the first 30 second 45 seconds once those people are hooked then i would take 15 seconds to thank the for the subscribers and uh add in like subscribe to the channel so that flip for you will be very helpful your retention rate will go up and then these videos will start going up faster all right radiance i would be happy to review my channel olivia okay let's see she says can you do mine okay let's take a look at it but other than that good job hello my name's olivia tops and welcome back ocean channel oh [ __ ] that you don't have anything hold on because i'm doing work hey you do not have to play hey let's go and if you're not familiar with me or haven't come across any of my content hi hey my name is olivia ty and i have a mindset let's go manifestation coach entrepreneur and mommy of two beautiful little boys let's go though we are so i actually really like this i love the music and the vibe and like the boss attitude i have a store but the difference between people like oprah people like tony robbins people like people like gary vee oh [ __ ] tony robbins oprah and gary v okay i'm hooked like me and maybe people like you is that we don't play small we somewhere along the way we realize just how valuable being us truly is so if you have a dream or appalling or something that's inside of you [ __ ] feel this bro i can [ __ ] with this video maybe you so very well maybe you give great advice bro i would literally work out to this video tomorrow burning in love for society and humanity for you played children you've played extremely small you got to stop it cut it cut it period because that's not who you were meant to be and that's you see my my son dude you see my my son in the background my son that's not who you should be and you say i'm going okay olivia you here have i would actually watch your channel over even mine like uh are sitting on a gold mine so like i need for mindset [ __ ] is so [ __ ] important and like i literally subscribe to your channel i don't subscribe to [ __ ] um i this is the voice that like is actually helpful and these voices are everything to have this in your head you can have the devil's advocate [ __ ] the devil's advocates and the [ __ ] um everybody who's like too deep in their head and they have to analyze everything and think about it that is a disease this is what the world actually needs right like overthinking doesn't actually ever really help anything so for me personally if i just get very real with you that voice i need it i need more of that voice and even in our team right now we're creating that voice together as a culture and that and we're protecting it and preserving it and it is already changing everything so just like listening to this is amazing and then just like the beat and everything because like for me even when i listen to motivational stuff like i'm always like damn i want to make my own motivational stuff just so i can add a trap beat on it or like hiphop or something so i can vibe with it this i can vibe with so [ __ ] hard and then you're talking about mental wellness you're talking about overcoming adversity you're talking about personal fulfillment you're talking about stop playing small you're able you're trying to help people with depression this is something that the world truly truly needs here are the areas where i want you to improve okay olivia this is important because you're sitting on something where if you keep going with this this will actually become something and there's a reason why i followed and i'm sure people on the stream uh they're gonna hit subscribe as well um i want you to work on a few things lighting so i can see you okay um i wanna see you better and then maybe if you can get a yeti mic so i could hear you better because right now i'm very distracted between here and here and like looking at what's happening in the background and looking at this vent so that a lot of it okay but please hear me on this i want you to keep making videos even with the bad quality quote unquote not the best quality so don't let my words stop you from making content because you're like i will wait until i get the best no no don't do that i want you to keep making content i'll give you some simple tips if you shoot in daylight where the window is pointing to you already your lighting problems are solved it's like already ready to go if you just put up a light on you that's like clear and then you just sit there and give me the words you're gonna give me heavy hitting because the whole thing is about mindset and voice it would really help me if the audio quality is better so if you can actually you know get a yeti mic or something something cheap you don't have to really go like go overboard but this is awesome that you have something special here and thank you for sharing this actually this was this was so cool um okay qazi i would love your feedback this is my newest channel so gabi sent this so that's how you're gonna break your first thousand subscribers uh olivia you gotta just go and you gotta like make more content honestly so let me see how many videos you have you already got the thumbnail game down you're gonna grow you're gonna grow you just gotta go now you're gonna grow you're already talking about loa law of attraction you already know about that gary vee gang and tony robbins and oprah and like you're you're dialed in you know the titles you know that like you know what you're doing and then you got the value bombs and then you got the mindset work and it's boss ass [ __ ] it's gonna go as long as you don't stop so amazing and 17 hours ago five days ago six days ago one week ago and now to me it also means you're not talking [ __ ] when i see this and you making content like this you see what i'm saying frankie to me this is respect now i trust you as a if you're some [ __ ] ass manifestation coach where like the last time you posted a video was four months ago that is [ __ ] that's not manifestation that's somebody who's trying to make money off of manifestation but somebody who's actually putting in the grind and i can see it one week ago six days ago five days ago 17 hours ago that is real love it love it love it love it um all right cool here we go gabi i think god she's in pwj too right gabi alvarado i think so i don't know i feel like i know this name so um okay cool let's go great intro i don't understand it frankie probably understands it but like good intro hey she gets it good intro nice got some images and broll rich dad poor dad padre rico padre pobre hey let's go uh okay got some broll here i like it i love you know what i love the fact that the fact that you didn't even pay for it like i mean don't get me wrong i love paying for services and making sure their businesses are supported but like i love that you didn't let that stop you is what i'm trying to say like it just says shutterstock and you put it anyway so many people get into their own heads about this type of stuff you got broll okay this is great you're sitting in different locations you're moving on to an excel sheet oh oh my god you you finance it's on finance you um you are about to blow up if you keep going the thumbnail game is down too okay 70 subscribers already 109 89 views 132 views 51 views the titles could be better all right let me see let me go to english all right what do banks and finance companies take into account bear buying debt and financial horror story what is the capacity to pay okay great job i think keep going um yeah she is a pwg student yep gabi uh the only thing i can tell you is keep going and make more you're you're on the right track you just need to make more content the only things that could like improve um audio quality maybe investing in a better camera at some point but for now don't let that even that stop you just produce more all right oh man let's see what's happening because i'm like way above in the comments so i want to see like what is happening down great olivia says great job i'm a pwg student gabi oh i'm liking the comments you guys got a good engagement going okay yeah i've been playing small yeah got me motivated uh okay do you guys have a by the way if you guys pick out a channel too i would i i will jump on it all right let's see here so here rafikaze saw you mentioned more about showing revealing physic is it so necessary essential to show face it helps because humans watch content it helps um if you don't want to show it then produce good [ __ ] content then that's the only play you have then just make it really good and people will still watch it there's tons of people doing broll voice over over content you can make it good do a voiceover and it'll be good okay got it and he wants to get this one he wants to get roasted all right let's go roast all right the youtube roast whoa i don't even need to eat food today yeah you guys want the dark roast or the light roast let me know that too ahead of time how are you guys wanted medium roasted dark roast or light roast you guys let me know when you drop the link so if you're gonna drop the link to your channel you want me to roast you then give me what type of roast do you want um you can also get a decaf if you don't want any roast you can get a decaf all right here we go so um free editable invoice pdf format okay apparently blew up [ __ ] um ecd three free save the date cards photoshop pst what kind of [ __ ] it's like we gotta make this content now creating an android mini car park app okay let's take a look at this hello guys um okay today i'll be creating a really simple car park application for android um it's actually universal right outside of troll but then what i can okay i got your problem okay so let's see i'm just gonna take a look at one last thing when was the newest video one month ago our body that's called elevation right elevation is how high do you want it nice so here is the main problem okay this is what difference between professional youtubers and amateur this is how i know you're an amateur youtuber my friend all right let's get into the rose session so you have these videos that have clearly gotten 34 000 24 000 views but the last time you dropped them was five years ago three years ago five years ago so um that's the number one way that's how you not not grow your channel to 1 000 subscribers this is how you do it guys you find what works and then you decide deliberately you premeditate and think about it you decide not to do more of it that's the number one way to not grow your channel so the the best advice i can give to that is don't do that don't find what works let the market tell you that it works let your channel blow up and then go okay i'm not going to do more of this anymore so that's one thing i will say make more content like this that worked right this should give you an insight into the things that are working what i would do is i would make more content maybe make a react app where you're showing how to build an app and it'll kill that's what we're doing a clevver programmer and it crushes it so you know i think that if you do that along with post consistently i think you will win because you get it you're already past the 500 subscribers you just got a few more subscribers right now while we're on this all right cool cool make good content on popular titles on specially stuff that is performed well historically there's a number one way to not grow by not listening to the historic um historical data so there you go salman that's my feedback for you bro make more of the stuff that worked vicente says that was a light rasquazzi hey rafikaze decaf please radion sent me one and goes dark dark roast me boss i [ __ ] love this let's go all right radion wants a dark roast let's give him a dark roast yo what's up everybody welcome to tnp and welcome to my first react video here in this youtube channel so this is my first time coding on react and i think i'm going to do more videos using react because for me react is the best framework the best javascript framework if you don't know react react is a framework built by facebook is used to create web applications with one page or multiple pages using routes but you you gotta keep it moving bro and the start like you can't just hold it and not do anything in the start um so make sure that in the start you're keeping it moving like my visuals if they don't change for more than two seconds i'm already out but definitely if they're like not moving for this long then i'm definitely going to be out to build a youtube converter app if you don't know what is a youtube converter we are i'm going to search right now on google and show you so youtube have that [ __ ] prepared beforehand bro don't waste my time on it like if you want to show me what a youtube converter app is have it open already or put it on previous slides like have slideshow or have it prepared so then when you move to it you can move to and i can see it right away because like it's taking me too long to get to what we're going to be doing and why we're going to be doing it i also don't care about like what react.js framework is if i'm not like sold on the idea of what we're going to be building so the right way to do it is start it with the app be like we are going to be building this youtube converter app with react.js if you're excited smash the like button let's get in right into this video that's how you respect my time that's how you actually get me to pay attention and go to the next seconds if the video starts with this where it's like five seconds of your [ __ ] intro with nothing um i'm out you just wasted my time i don't care about what how fancy your [ __ ] logo is or what kind of graphics you have behind it it's it's a waste of my time it's not respectful to me right so five seconds in i don't know what is happening or what this is about or what i'm gonna get out of it what's up everybody welcome six seconds in welcome eight seconds in 10 seconds 12 seconds i still have no idea what it is about i think i'm going to do more videos using react because i don't care because um it's my first time so i don't care why you're gonna do more videos on react or this is your first time doing a video on react for me react is the best i don't care about you i care about me i still don't understand what's in it for me framework the best javascript framework i don't care because i don't even know what the app is that we're building and maybe i already know about react if you don't know react react is uh i probably wouldn't click on a video with react js if i didn't already know what it is so right now it might not be the best time to explain to me about react.js is used to create web applications with and then i mean by this time i'm out bro so um how to improve it get into the app really really fast as soon as you possibly can your first five seconds should be extremely relevant to what this video is gonna be about so i'll give you an example right if you go to clever programmer look at how we do our live streams this is one hack we learn and it helps us dominate so let me actually show you um let's go to this video right us reacting to apps and um qazi and sunny react to mindblowing react native apps let's see what the intro is lee from cleverprogrammer.com today i am here with your boy papa react how's it going guys super excited for today's video kazi what are we up to today guys we are going to be reacting to some insane apps on react native so within the first 17 seconds you know what we're going to be doing right do you know what we're going to be doing yes or no i've done that in the first 17 seconds because i'm respecting your time in the first year with your boy in the first four seconds i cut to the screen and i start even showing and demonstrating what we're gonna be working on i'm getting your trust if you don't see me get your trust then you're not gonna like follow it right let's see what happens in this video everybody hope you get so let's go down to let's pick out some other clone oh [ __ ] frankie and amana 25 000 views bro i want more of you more of you on the channel because you're dropping views all right so let's go to ones that are i mean this is like i think really crazy because we've edited this but um what i'm trying to find is i'm trying to find like our live stream so let me go to not live now let's go to uh past live streams and i want to go to like some of the some of the stuff where we're building apps for you guys so build a tinder clone build an airbn so this one let's click on this good boy sonny how's it going guys good to see you again and today we're gonna be building the react clone of airbnb so there 10 seconds in and the scene is set right the stage is set you know what you're going to be building you can see it you can visualize it you can touch it taste it smell it and now you got it now if you want to leave go ahead and leave but you visually see what we're going to be building i'm not using so many of my words to waste your time and you're like dude i don't know if it's going to be [ __ ] actually good or not i might as well just leave so in the start it's extremely important to put your hook and demonstrate truly why i will stick through and watch your video so that's that other than that i think the video is pretty good this drink so and again you know maybe volume up energy up um if your energy is not that up then maybe a better job with editing and better audio quality so i would invest in a better mic because there's a lot of noise i can hear in the back and i forgot right i can hear your computer fan running or your room fan running and leaves a bad taste in my mouth all right cool let's see who else we got nice hopefully you guys are liking this love the contrast calling your thumbnails of your videos thank you all right so the real secret guys to breaking your first 1000 subscribers right on youtube is really oh what did i do oh [ __ ] close everything all right so hopefully we'll get everything back up and running in a second oh wow all right sorry about that guys so the real secret to growing your channel and getting it started and getting it past that 1 000 subscriber mark is really keep posting more content so one is your quantity of content so you want to keep posting more so let's say this is what happens when you post more and then let's say this is your views right so you want to post more content and you will keep increasing linearly most of the times if you post more banger content then you will improve a lot faster so if i go into my journey of what happened i'll show you behind my analytics if you guys want to take a look at that and i'll go to where i broke my first 1000 subscribers literally was april to december 3rd right so you can see very little subscribers for a while and then boom december 3rd was was the exact day i hit my 1 000 subscribers so that's my friends how this took place is because right here i started making a lot of content so if you look here there's a lot of content right almost none of you guys that shared with me your channels very few of you actually had this volume of content and then when it comes to the content it's very precise niche down and then like on banker titles so because these titles i knew would get a lot of viewership so then it's tons of viewership and then i just made sure that the videos are good so let's go to my channel and i'm gonna go to videos and by the way guys if you're enjoying this smash that like button if you're whether on your face facebook or youtube this way the video goes out to more and more people julio says this is definitely a dope format reacting to channels live is interesting to watch even when you're not the one getting raided yeah so there it is right boom going through this and i made a bunch of these videos right the codecademy tutorial and it was a popular title then i launched a python programming series which like and eventually just blew the [ __ ] up uh this put me on the map right three or four thousand views 288 000 views 157 000 views um and then i made some random content that ended up not doing well because it was just too random for people like ufc 205 reaction snooker and amazon fba business people like what the [ __ ] is going on programming and life in chicago after 2016 election so oh [ __ ] was that when trump became president i think so right so after that my views started going down i'm kidding so that's what you can see happen and there were a bunch of really weird videos i started making and then i got back on track with how to teach yourself to code free code camp learn python did python programming so wherever i got off track and started making random content you can see how it like just didn't provide any results and it kind of like sucked right i talk about coding and provide valuable tips 20 000 views i talk about some random stuff 540 views importance of finding a mentor 1 500 views so this is where like it really matters that you're talking about valuable stuff on a regular basis right i go to sql then the views go up i talk about coding views go up all right if you guys have more channels for me to uh rate i will go ahead and do that so just says decaf what's up so it just says decaf please so let's see what is happening here cool thumbnails actually right yeah like good thumbnails like seems like a good channel 189 subscribers it's a good sign and we're playing apex legends ranked okay i got my boy right here in case i think it would be really cool if i can see you what's good did you start it yeah i did buckle and this time the audience can hear you how about they can uh i'm just gonna make sure real quick just just give me a second let me just make sure real quick okay yeah do that do that all right so the start this is one thing i notice a lot with streaming and streamers and this is where i where they [ __ ] up a lot and this is what allowed my live streams to do really really well your start is one of your most important points if you have a poor start your replay value drops essentially to zero so then if you don't get views during the live you will never get more views on that video because the replay value is killed because the start is like the start is always like hello hello can you guys hear me can you guys oh is my mic on hey hey we're starting right now are we started yet cool cool all right um okay uh checking the audio are you guys hearing this hello okay cool cool cool all right bro all right so that is the number one way to kill your replay value because when i'm watching now like [ __ ] this like they're not prepared this is not gonna be good this is gonna be garbage and it's a waste of my time i i it's so much better if i just don't watch this and waste my time on it so the hack is just this man like like i know that what's holding you back there's a lot of like self confidence and self the same stuff too uh and you have to be careful about that and just work on it yourself you might be with a friend you're like if i try to sound professional my friend is going to make fun of me thinking that i'm like trying to be so official and so i might as well just play it cool and laugh it off so then when my friend says something i can just be like yeah i was just like joking you know like i wasn't really like commit to your [ __ ] videos so like next time it starts i want you to be like guys this is nova place and today we're gonna be playing apex legend season six intro it look at the [ __ ] camera and if you're gonna hide your face which i don't know why everybody's trying to hide their face like it's like um it's almost like some kind of like epidemic with lower selfesteem that is going on around the world and i want you guys to work on that because it will affect you in so many ways in the long run i want you to get confidence out of this that's what my number one thing is why i want you guys to get on camera show your face show your videos not just so your youtube channel does well so you improve your confidence your speaking ability because if you're hiding on a youtube video how many other places in your life are you hiding you're probably hiding at your work because you're scared to have the conversation you're scared to show your face you know in those meetings maybe when you're in a group of friends maybe you're not saying your joke or your punch line because you think nobody's gonna hear you maybe you're hiding in your relationship and not saying what you truly need to say and own up to your [ __ ] so it's not just you hide on a youtube video you're hiding in many [ __ ] other places and that's what that gives away when i watch your video so guys more confidence mental health is very important this is why i even like really appreciate olivia's channel because she talks about she's talking about mental health so selfesteem selfworth selfconfidence extremely important people especially for streaming bro people don't watch your stream because of audio people don't watch your stream because of what game you're playing people watch or stream because of your personality and who you are the laziest people the the weirdest i've seen the weirdest people have big followings and streaming because people want to follow weird people but they just own it that they're [ __ ] weird the people who don't get followed are the people who don't show themselves or don't share their voice right like so i want to follow somebody who i can build a relationship with it's really hard for me to build a relationship with just voice don't know what you look like i don't know what you sound like i don't know who you are i can't read you like it's so much more entertaining when i can read your micro expressions if you're playing apex and you're like in trouble or you're like at a difficult level or you're playing with somebody and they're [ __ ] you up i want to see what happens in your expressions i'm going to see what happens when you're playing the game so um if you're especially streaming i think that's important the second thing is when the thing starts give a solid intro to what is happening as soon as you know you're live the second you hit live don't do the checking test test test don't do that just full this is nova place you're watching apex legends season six uh six ranked gold grind guys today we're gonna be grinding it out and i'm playing with one of my buddies and we're just going to go all in for you guys it's going to be super exciting i'm so glad you're here hit that like button so this video goes out to more people subscribe to the channel because we're going to be bringing you game play after gameplay and you're going to see us grind our faces off in apex legends all right let's roll and then just roll with your boy go right and start playing the game or whatever um so i think that will add a ton of replay value to your videos and then it will grow that way so i know it was probably not that light of a roast but all right matt short says roast me all right let's go to match short okay cool python short intro to python syntax i like it um five seconds in i think i would like it better if you even say it like with your voice but just keep in mind for intros long time so i recommend not having an intro just getting to it and then adding the intro later i recommend adding the intro later not the first possible thing hey everybody what's up how you doing today good energy very good energy hey so in this video uh we're going to talk about a little bit about python syntax and it's going to be a short introduction and i know trust me i can see the excitement on your face all the way through the internet so i'm gonna do these examples in idle which is python's integrated development and learning nice i like the joke i like that little like connection point i would like it even more i mean i feel like you got good personality i would like to see your face somewhere environment and here you can see it over here on my screen and if you're coming to python from another language the first thing you'll probably notice is that python statements don't have an any delimiter meaning some languages have some i like that you even edited it make it made it punchier that's really good thank you for that some kind of symbol to signal to the computer that they've reached line so we could just write something as simply as you uploaded this today great uh the only thing is why is it unlisted bro make this public this is awesome print and then it's indented four spaces and we'll get to the indents in a minute but for right now i just want you to understand that the code blocks each start with a semicolon or i'm sorry a colon and then into the block so we can say cool a varying different amount of spaces you got it you got this if you don't stop and you keep putting out content your channel will grow channel will grow everything we have you don't need to put your face unless you want to um you know it's a cool intro but i would i would start it off first and then intro it i think the things you can improve is add your face in the start what's up guys today we're gonna be giving you a short intro to python let's roll the intro and boom the intro then rolls so like imagine right how many seconds is that so what's up guys what's up guys today we're going to be talking about python let's roll the intro so that's about three to four seconds right when i counted it's about three to four seconds roll then turn three to four seconds and then boom get into the video i would make the intro even shorter try to get the intro like really really really short if you can just because it's it's not the best use of somebody's time um and yeah so that i think is gonna be good i think if you improve your audio quality so there's less background sound i think that will improve i'm liking that you're editing this that's a real that's really good too just a bit all right we'll save that so in this video uh we're gonna talk about a little bit about python but if you keep going with this you will grow so good job great work you put a put up a video i'm i'm happy roast me alive all right cool let's see who else is there test run um what type of roast are you looking for jesus if you don't say anything then i'm just gonna roast hey what's up chief yo the best audio quality so far now this is the first setup this is not gonna be you guys notice that right when the audio is right it just comp million times the difference like i would sacrifice video quality over audio even though youtube is a video platform i actually put sixty percent of the effort uh emphasis on audio and 40 of it on actually video so you guys notice that right as soon as this audio is good you're kind of hooked and you want to know what's happening in actual video of um that i'm going to put on youtube this is just a test run video and basically what i'm going to do with this is going to be like a trial and error i want to you know play a lot play with this two recordings because i'm using two cameras oh [ __ ] son most luckily i have two of the same kind and i'm gonna you know pull put this all right he's ready to blow up make sure your comments are turned on bro don't turn comments off because of insecurity i mean i don't know if you did that or if it automatically bro i'm gonna um mess around with the lighting i'm gonna mess around with the sound also and uh i'm going to send it to you hopefully you see you see this video and you know you can give me some good um criticism some good try to so uh a simple hack i'll tell you to improve the video so video is like 90 about lighting if you can get the lighting right the video just solves itself very few times you truly have to upgrade to a new camera um when you have light behind you that's a bad idea you should sit facing the other way so that light coming from that window points to you i wouldn't put more light behind me because now i'm paying more attention here than your face so if you sat the other way where if you turned around and were looking out the window and then you had the camera pointing to you from there then your face would be really lit up and i'd be able to see you a lot better and then it would like look much better uh second thing is i think there's a lot of like extra headspace so i would move the frame down so your head is like close to touching this more but outside of that brother i think if you make content that's valuable and you give valuable tips or suggest suggestions because i'm using two cameras you're on a winning you're about to win because you got good setup you have a good voice you have a great personality good confidence if you give valuable stuff and keep going you will grow a channel out of this radion says he's like owen cook right yeah kind of uh shubham says roast me if you can all right let's go youtube roast javascript here we go so hello guys this is welcome to the channel one of it so ask my video functions and functions nice good i like it in javascript or any other programming language so guys let's start the video nice that is great good audio quality good that he gives you what this is gonna be about and then he rolls the intro this dude respects my time i respect him back there's a reason why he has 16 to zero like the dislike ratio programming language and he already has things up he's already even giving you an insight into what's going to be happening in the video so guys let's start the video cool intro i speak urdu as well fluently um i mean you're speaking hindi but they're very similar hindi or do so i like the hindi and english mix mix and match that's pretty cool i speak with my family like that because i'm fluent in urdu uh slash hindi i'm and i'm fluent in english obviously so this is a cool way to do it and you're just keeping you're very clean and to the point so that's really good for example alert this is the first channel i've seen that is clean like when it comes to hindi and urdu most of the times it's like most of them they're not clean it's just like really weird people talking and sort of really weird videos this is like a clean video it's almost like it's literally a channel that was made in u.s and it's like banging but now you just mixed hindi with it and you're off to the races so this is gonna do well i think um i would improve the thumbnails i don't know why you have 7 8 9 10 numbers in there like i would not have those uh yeah i wouldn't have numbers like most of your views will come from somebody new right so somebody news coming in they don't care about your numbers most people watch videos based on what is in their home feed and recommended right so if i see a two um it will actually make me even really less likely to click on it what the [ __ ] is happening it's part two of something i don't wanna watch it because i probably haven't even seen part one so i would recommend um yeah more thumbnails like that i think that's good this one is too much it's kind of ugly it's just too much text this is a good thumbnail this is cool and then yeah let's click on your most popular videos oh nice web development in 100 seconds let's take a look at this 48 0 this has got to be

store in 10 minutes yo you guys saw that in the first six seconds he told me what the [ __ ] we're gonna be doing that's so cool the only thing that would improve this is if i could see the actual store in the first six seconds like i think it would be a lot cooler if you didn't have any of this text and instead in the background you actually had the store open that we're going to build we're going to show you how to set up your shop and we're also going to show you exactly how to start out how to pick your products and then finally we're going to show you how to launch the store nice you can have customers oh snap first we're gonna show you how to set up your shop i love it all right let's dive right in the first step is loving the lighting loving the circular camera at the bottom left looks very modern very clean so go to shopify.com type in your store name what shopify has to offer here we see the brook i love that he looks confused he's like let's see what shopify has to offer and like he hasn't seen it before he's like he's like actually a couple of other free themes just so you can get an idea of what shopify has so i love that here we see them he's like all right edit that part out i got lost brooklyn theme it fits into our aesthetic what all right email apparel and we see here our let's see this collection let's go to the skirt collection to cart and there you have it it's a store full of curated products ready to go nice and ready to go live shopify.com wow okay so um a few things okay so something's up with the audio i don't like the audio we installed it too yeah audio is a problem okay so the on the light roast and audio is the number one problem i see with this video outside of it a lot of the things i really really like i like the energy hi baby thank you so i like the energy i like how you look in this i like the tutorial another way i'll i want to see if this video is going to be a good video as i skim through it so if i skim through it and there are a lot of visual changes happening to me that is a sign of a really entertaining and interesting video when i skim through it and nothing changes i'm like oh this video is going to suck and usually it sucks so that's really good on the the best thing i like about it that you can never go wrong with is true value in this video if you go through it you actually build a store when you deliver that type of value even if your content's quality is not the best it will perform well so on that end i feel like you are completely on the right track i love your stuff so you already commented nice all right yep so great video frank this is this is really good just audio quality get a yeti please keep it closed and you're gonna be good and i know you got money so just invest into a short sm7b like if you really want to go next level and get a road caster pro with it or if you i mean you'll be fine with yeti bro yeti is really good i grew my entire channel clever programmer and yeti so you'll be fine um nice mindset goal i'm loving this i got that some b7 sm7b today nice what is it sm7b right it's sm7b i think yeah sm7b cool uh dope dope dope like the contrast visual's changing very attention grabbing yes so it's a really good sign of when you see things changing i'll give you like when i know a video is going to be a banger i just make it i dial it in like crazy so if you can dial your video in like crazy you're going to succeed so let me go to our most popular videos and you'll see how dialed in they actually are so let's click this one top five programming languages to learn in 2020 top five programming languages for you to learn in 2020 how long did it take for me to deliver the information regarding what this video is going to be about

what's gonna be happening for you to learn in 2020 to get a job without even needing a college degree i make a video on this topic every single year and you guys seem to eat it up a video i made in 2018 got over two million views this is called social proofing so i'm referring to a previous like this is a little bit more advanced but can i share some advanced tips with you guys too um so this is like a little bit more advanced but it's called social proofing so i'm throwing social proof to what i'd done in the past and how we did because that creates more uh social proof so then people are

main factors number one the time it takes for you to learn even if you're a complete so i'm changing my framing quite a bit just to keep it entertaining and moving i know if i nail the first minute i'm gonna [ __ ] keep you for the rest of it i know that so that that is why the first minute is so important if you can tightly pack it and script it and go you really have a chance for your videos to blow up beginner and make real world projects number two the job market what is the demand and the overall salary that you what is your overall productive or own and when your applications youtube algorithm it's been destroyed here's another pro hack ask for a like when you ask for a like you will get million times more likes right how about this 130 000 likes who here would like 130 000 likes on their video who here would like 1.7 million views on their video so the key is to ask for it and if you can make it an entertaining way and at the right time not just in the start like the first dude whose videos we saw i was like what the [ __ ] is this he's not looking at the camera and he's like he's like i want you to it's like looking off into the sunset and he's like i want you to go to every video of mine and just leave a comment every single video and he's like like every single video nobody's gonna [ __ ] do that because they don't care and you can't ask without giving them something entertaining i've already entertained you i've already gotten your attention you're already here for one minute so i can actually ask you now to smash the like button and watch how i do this here enough time by the way i would love if you help me beat the youtube algorithm it's been destroying my channel if you want to help me do that smash that like button like no like really just go and
