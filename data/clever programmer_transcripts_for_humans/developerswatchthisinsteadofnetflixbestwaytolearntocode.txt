00:59 - and you are thinking even if i'm not
01:02 - building the clones with them am i
01:03 - really learning
01:04 - the truth of the matter is even
01:07 - oftentimes if you're not speaking a
01:09 - language like when i go
01:10 - when i went to colombia even when i
01:12 - wasn't speaking spanish that much
01:14 - i was picking it up so much that even
01:17 - sometimes now i'll say words and frankie
01:20 - you can speak perfect spanish right but

01:28 - all the time so that's what will happen
01:31 - with you where you will be able to pick
01:32 - up or react
01:34 - and have pattern recognition with
01:35 - javascript simply because you

01:40 - remember that i think that's
01:42 - huge exactly guys uh
01:45 - and that's it it's all about pattern
01:47 - recognition and just like the more you
01:49 - see these things the more you sort of
01:50 - get exposed to it
01:51 - the more it's going to digest and be
01:54 - inside
01:55 - and sort of be easier for you to pick up
01:57 - in the future as well so just by being
01:59 - here even if it doesn't make sense
02:00 - is making a huge development on your
02:02 - development career yeah
02:04 - awesome nice
