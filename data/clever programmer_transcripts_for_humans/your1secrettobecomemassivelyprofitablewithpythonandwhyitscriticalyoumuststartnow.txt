With timestamps:

00:00 - that's really i'm live online alright
00:11 - let's do this thing let's bring this
00:13 - here oh I'm not actually live on
00:17 - Instagram yet hey guys what's up how's
00:21 - it going
00:22 - this is Kazi from clever programmer
00:24 - dot-com awesome this is amazing bunch of
00:29 - you guys are here don't know how many
00:32 - yet but I will find out in a second
00:35 - looks like zero people are watching is
00:37 - that true okay so we have a few people
00:43 - here that's good we have a few people
00:45 - going on Instagram awesome ok great to
00:49 - have you guys here
00:50 - settle in guys so today we're gonna be
00:54 - talking about your number one secret to
00:57 - become a Python profitable massively
01:00 - profitable programmer okay and why it's
01:04 - critical that you must start now so what
01:07 - I want you to do is kind of buckle in
01:12 - alright get some popcorn get some coffee
01:15 - kind of like I got here from Dunkin
01:18 - Donuts and just sit back and kind of
01:23 - enjoy alright we're gonna be covering
01:25 - did you make sure that it the landscape
01:28 - mode is unlocked because if you don't do
01:31 - that it'll like mess up the whole thing
01:32 - so end it and then order just yeah
01:35 - figure it out awesome cool alright so
01:40 - what we're doing today is we're actually
01:42 - gonna be live on YouTube we're also
01:44 - going live on Instagram and we're gonna
01:48 - be going live on Facebook and I'm lucky
01:52 - to have my friends here today helping me
01:54 - because usually it's like there's too
01:56 - many things going on it gets really
01:58 - confusing and so today it's gonna be a
01:59 - lot simpler alright
02:21 - okay so guys make sure that what you
02:24 - start doing is also start posting your
02:26 - questions and I want you to start
02:29 - thinking of the types of questions
02:30 - you're gonna be asking all right and so
02:34 - then later when we get into kind of like
02:36 - the Q&A section a little bit I want to
02:38 - get your most burning questions and
02:40 - answer them for you while I have you
02:43 - here okay I want to do that and in this
02:46 - livestream what I'm gonna be covering
02:49 - I'm gonna be going over a lot of what a
02:51 - Python developers lifestyle is like I
02:54 - want to tell you how I negotiated you
02:58 - know going from $50 an hour to $100 an
03:02 - hour in one phone call I'm gonna tell
03:05 - you about one of my first Python jobs
03:08 - that I ended up landing where I made
03:11 - twenty plus thousand dollars in less
03:14 - than one month and the reason why I'm
03:17 - gonna be giving you guys this
03:18 - information is so you guys can see how
03:20 - you can apply this to yourself all right
03:22 - so I'm gonna be saying it from my
03:24 - perspective but I want you to constantly
03:27 - be thinking how it could be you in that
03:29 - position okay because all of these
03:31 - things I'm telling you are you know when
03:34 - I was not a very good developer I was
03:37 - just a few months in to learning about
03:40 - programming and at that time I was going
03:42 - through the same things of being just
03:44 - like super frustrated not being able to
03:47 - figure out what the hell programming is
03:49 - and grasping my mind around a ton of
03:54 - concepts so for example things like okay
03:56 - I have these coding skills I can do if
04:00 - statements I can do print and I can do
04:03 - you know some basic coding exercises on
04:06 - platforms like hacker rank or I've gone
04:09 - through some courses on Coursera Udacity
04:11 - but I was always confused as to how do I
04:15 - take those concepts and then actually
04:19 - build real-world apps with them and how
04:22 - do I go from you know just knowing code
04:24 - to actually building real apps and how
04:29 - do I go from that
04:31 - then actually charging people and making
04:34 - money making a living off of it and then
04:37 - living a comfortable lifestyle and then
04:39 - how do I go about hiring and firing my
04:42 - clients something that you can do too so
04:45 - you don't have to work with clients that
04:48 - you do not like all right so we're gonna
04:52 - be getting deep into many many many pain
04:55 - points and also we're gonna be covering
04:57 - a lot of things that give you value as
05:00 - soon as you step out of this livestream
05:03 - okay we can even call this a workshop so
05:07 - I want to give you value as soon as you
05:09 - leave and give you many many things to
05:12 - take away all right so again kind of
05:14 - relax and enjoy and we're gonna be going
05:16 - through all of this okay and how is the
05:24 - audio coming around for you guys are you
05:27 - guys able to hear me a lot clearer
05:31 - let me turn up the gain on this thing
05:33 - okay could I add some volume all right
05:36 - I'll do that all right my mic is working
05:40 - that's good and I'll turn up my gain and
05:43 - I'll also talk from a little bit closer
05:47 - okay clear okay beautiful now I'm okay
05:51 - on Instagram it's clear that's good
05:54 - Instagram volume is coming out of my
05:56 - phone and then we're basically figuring
05:58 - out right now how to set up Facebook
06:00 - that's taking a while and we're just
06:03 - gonna make sure that that's good to go
06:05 - in a second so sorry still working on
06:07 - that guys and then we are I think should
06:11 - be better on YouTube how are we doing
06:15 - Tenzin give me a little thumbs up or
06:16 - something okay okay cool all right
06:22 - beautiful we have quite a few people on
06:25 - our YouTube and we have a few people on
06:27 - our can you frame it right okay awesome
06:30 - like
06:32 - and then just make it a little bit
06:34 - taller just just here just like right to
06:39 - there and then you know just cool
06:53 - alright need to be doing more of these
07:00 - all right now I should be going live and
07:03 - I should be live on Facebook
07:05 - hello Facebook how's it going Facebook
07:08 - Instagram YouTube all right we are live
07:11 - everywhere again this is your number one
07:14 - secret okay then I'm gonna be sharing
07:17 - today to profit with Python okay this is
07:22 - your workshop that we're gonna be going
07:24 - through today and why it's critical that
07:27 - you must start on this right now all
07:30 - right
07:30 - uh-huh and I'm gonna be sharing those
07:32 - things as we go along so first of all
07:37 - let's talk about the job opportunity for
07:39 - software developers and how this market
07:41 - is growing and what your future can be
07:43 - looking like okay what the job
07:45 - opportunities are so right now okay even
07:50 - according to Forbes Python is the number
07:53 - one language of 2017 okay so this is a
07:59 - good year for us and by 2020 it's
08:02 - actually going even higher all right
08:05 - it's going to be staying at the top and
08:08 - beating out all other languages so I am
08:13 - kind of excited about that some other
08:15 - amazing things about this language
08:17 - programming language is like think about
08:20 - all of the things that are made with
08:22 - this okay so this is something I've
08:24 - mentioned before but I'm gonna mention
08:28 - it again for everybody maybe you missed
08:30 - it alright so again platforms big huge
08:34 - platforms are built with this language
08:36 - okay so Instagram where you are on right
08:39 - now is built with Python okay YouTube
08:42 - where you are right now is built with
08:45 - Python and I don't think there's a lot
08:48 - of Python used in Facebook right tenzin
08:53 - that's not true in facebook right okay
08:58 - so there are a lot of languages and even
09:00 - in Facebook there's a little bit of
09:01 - Python Spotify is built off of Python
09:05 - reddit is built off of Python Hipmunk is
09:10 - built off of Python okay events Brite is
09:15 - built off of Python so think about all
09:18 - the things that are built with Python do
09:20 - you guys know what Google is built with
09:22 - Python all right and Sergey grinned the
09:25 - CEO of Google said Python where we can
09:29 - see where we must alright so with all
09:33 - these big platforms and these platforms
09:37 - that are only growing all right we all
09:39 - have like billions of users using
09:42 - Instagram Facebook YouTube Google reddit
09:47 - Spotify and with these platforms only
09:50 - growing what this means is that there is
09:53 - simply more room alright there's simply
09:57 - more room for more programmers more
10:00 - Python developers to have those jobs ok
10:04 - and again why I emphasize Python so much
10:07 - is because it's at the perfect
10:11 - intersection essentially of being the
10:13 - easiest programming language all right
10:16 - being the most growing and trending
10:19 - programming languages and being one of
10:21 - the most paid programming languages ok
10:25 - average Python developer makes anywhere
10:28 - from ninety to a hundred and thirty
10:30 - thousand dollars a year even more okay
10:35 - and it even and it depends where you
10:38 - live okay so if you're living in places
10:41 - like California in the heart of where
10:43 - the technologies that you can be even
10:46 - making more money okay and if you're
10:47 - living somewhere we're like Kazi I'm not
10:50 - getting and if you're living in a place
10:54 - where it's like Kazi there isn't much
11:01 - going on here we can't network with
11:04 - people for programming we can't find
11:06 - jobs for programming we can't find where
11:11 - we can get independent contractor work
11:13 - for programming you know what you should
11:15 - do you know what you should do
11:18 - obviously one stop making excuses and
11:22 - two you know what you should do leave
11:27 - that place relocate okay if that is the
11:32 - case like just the other day this
11:34 - reminds me I was on sorry I'm just gonna
11:37 - check if the audio is coming off well on
11:41 - YouTube
11:44 - coming off good audio yeah all right so
11:48 - we got good audio going awesome alright
11:53 - so if you're gonna leave and also
11:55 - sometimes like I'm talking take where
11:57 - I'm at because sometimes I forget so I
11:59 - just remind me thank you okay so
12:02 - basically when you're what so we either
12:05 - relocate right but don't make excuses
12:07 - and the reason why I'm kind of going off
12:09 - on this tangent is yesterday I shared
12:12 - one of my youtube videos which is what
12:15 - would I do if I were 18 again and you
12:18 - know it's I called it like your
12:19 - explosive four four secrets to your
12:21 - explosive career growth you know which
12:23 - is true and in that video I mentioned
12:27 - you should be doing things like creating
12:29 - content and sharing with the world and
12:31 - contributing to the world instead of
12:33 - just thinking procrastinating and
12:35 - lingering and then I had somebody who
12:37 - said cause II I'm 40 years old maybe
12:42 - this is something that works for a 22
12:45 - year old but I don't think this works
12:47 - for a 40 year old and so I saw that
12:51 - message and I'm like okay this is pretty
12:54 - interesting and also he complained that
12:56 - he was 40 so he said he was too old to
12:58 - get started and it'll take too long but
13:01 - then I told him look my story maybe
13:03 - should even motivate you because most of
13:05 - the results clever programmer went from
13:07 - having nobody zero subscribers right to
13:10 - having hundred thousand subscribers
13:12 - followers I got value out of it right if
13:14 - you're here you probably at some point
13:16 - got value out of it and so I told him
13:20 - that and I said look it means it
13:22 - possible for you to get these results in
13:24 - one year and you know what he told me
13:26 - back he replied and he goes well may
13:31 - I could get this in one year but he goes
13:34 - I'm living in places like New York San
13:38 - Fran and Washington DC he goes if you're
13:41 - forty or too old so you can't get that
13:43 - and then at that point I'm like if
13:48 - you're gonna just victimize yourself and
13:50 - look I'm on your side I'm trying to help
13:52 - him trying to motivate you and I'm
13:54 - trying to tell you it's possible I'm not
13:55 - just motivating you for the sake of
13:57 - motivating you I don't like doing that
13:59 - right if I but it's possible and it's
14:05 - not even that hard to do so why are you
14:07 - just putting these limits and
14:09 - restrictions on your own mind and
14:11 - stopping yourself from achieving these
14:13 - goals it's just kind of toxic and so I
14:16 - said like look you're just kind of
14:18 - putting limiting beliefs but then again
14:20 - he just kept going and arguing and at
14:22 - that point I was like okay you argue as
14:24 - to why you will never ever ever ever
14:27 - succeed you know I'm on your side but
14:30 - you're gonna argue that you're not gonna
14:31 - succeed so at that point I can't help
14:33 - you so if you're watching this remember
14:36 - that a lot of it has to do with your
14:39 - mindset okay where is your mind at if
14:42 - you don't think you deserve a lot of
14:44 - money or you don't think you deserve
14:45 - that Python development job you then
14:48 - won't get it okay you don't actually
14:50 - then deserve it so you have to change a
14:53 - lot of how you rewire your brain okay
14:57 - you have to kind of rewire that thing
14:59 - all right so we've hit on why Python is
15:04 - beating all other big programming
15:07 - languages and why it's so so so so so
15:10 - good okay it starts from if you're in a
15:12 - complete beginner you can learn super
15:14 - fast but if you're not just a beginner
15:17 - you know another benefit of it is
15:19 - companies like Instagram YouTube Google
15:22 - reddit spot if I built off with it so it
15:25 - means that there are just tons and tons
15:27 - of jobs the jobs are never going away
15:29 - it's only increasing at an exponential
15:32 - rate okay as long as platforms like
15:35 - Google reddit YouTube Spotify Hipmunk
15:37 - Eventbrite da-da-da-da-da as long as
15:39 - they keep growing the number of job
15:42 - opportunities for Python developers will
15:44 - only keep growing
15:45 - right and even when you get into
15:47 - artificial intelligence software
15:48 - developers are the ones that are running
15:50 - it I mean look at scan and go at Walmart
15:54 - all right it's replacing the people
15:56 - there guess whose scan and go is
15:58 - programmed by by programmers okay it's
16:01 - something that's actually programmed
16:03 - look at Google car self-driving cars
16:06 - programmers have to actually program
16:08 - that to work Tesla all right
16:11 - your phones your iPhone your snapchat
16:15 - like every single thing there's code
16:19 - running it every online platform that
16:21 - you're using so to think that it's
16:24 - something that's gonna die off in a few
16:27 - years or it's a dying career it's just a
16:29 - complete fallacy like a logical fallacy
16:33 - all right so now I kind of want to share
16:39 - with you guys my you know my story of
16:41 - how I went from getting that negotiating
16:46 - that $50 to $100 deal okay I literally
16:51 - went from making $50 an hour to $100 an
16:55 - hour with one phone call all right and I
16:59 - want to share that story with you and
17:01 - you're gonna learn a ton from it you can
17:04 - literally take this and apply to exactly
17:07 - what you're doing right now whatever
17:09 - company you're working in right now this
17:11 - has the potential to give you that race
17:13 - raise race give you that boost in your
17:17 - salary or maybe you're a freelancer and
17:19 - it can give you the boost in the money
17:22 - you're making and how comfortable you're
17:24 - living right now because because again
17:26 - the reason why we want to be earning
17:29 - more and getting paid over just what we
17:30 - deserve is not just for the sake of
17:32 - money itself right we want to take care
17:35 - of those around us we want to take care
17:37 - of our families we want to be able to
17:39 - support not only ourselves but the other
17:42 - people that we have in our lives
17:44 - because I think personally that it's
17:46 - selfish to only make enough to keep
17:49 - yourself happy okay I think that we
17:53 - should be focusing on making enough to
17:55 - kind of have everybody live that
17:57 - comfortable lifestyle around us so we
17:59 - can
17:59 - kind of help them if they need okay so
18:02 - this is why I think it's really
18:05 - important that you get actually paid
18:06 - what you deserve and that you're not
18:08 - overworked and underpaid okay that's my
18:12 - number one thing even if you leave this
18:15 - and you're like I'm never gonna touch
18:16 - Python or I'm never gonna touch
18:18 - programming I want you to be a I want
18:20 - you to be able to apply this in your
18:22 - life so tell me right now
18:26 - Instagram Facebook YouTube are you ready
18:32 - to hear the story are you ready to hear
18:35 - the story where I went from fifty to a
18:37 - hundred dollars an hour where I
18:39 - literally saved half of my life where I
18:42 - saved half of the years of my life you
18:45 - know kind of doing that because if you
18:47 - think about it normally you would go
18:48 - fifty debt it up and go all the way up
18:50 - and you would be spending twice as long
18:53 - and again this was when I was a beginner
18:55 - this was when I was just starting out
18:58 - okay this was when I didn't even have
19:01 - the programming skills that I do today
19:04 - I'm still not an expert okay I'm still
19:07 - not an expert having worked at a big
19:09 - company went to Community College 2.5
19:13 - GPA bad student but here's what I have
19:15 - been doing I have been making over a
19:17 - hundred and four thousand dollars
19:19 - starting at sophomore year at Oakton
19:23 - Community College okay so I'm not a good
19:28 - student
19:29 - but I do know how to provide value to
19:32 - people in the world and I do know how to
19:34 - get other people results okay and I want
19:36 - to share that with you so again
19:37 - are you ready if you are I want to be
19:40 - hearing a hell yeah all right we're
19:46 - getting some hell yes let's put this
19:48 - Facebook one just a little bit higher
19:50 - cuz it's like my hair's cutting off and
19:51 - my hair just looks so good today I want
19:53 - to make sure that it's seen all right
19:59 - just like you know just taller like okay
20:03 - there we go
20:04 - cool
20:06 - cuckoo-land you know dishes okay all
20:09 - right so here's the story okay buckle
20:12 - and buttercups let's go all right so
20:15 - here here it is let me let me grab some
20:17 - coffee in the meantime all you guys just
20:18 - you know wait for the story everybody's
20:22 - hooked man okay so here we go
20:35 - I had just gotten back from my Community
20:40 - College okay my Oakton Community College
20:42 - not exactly Harvard and I was wearing my
20:48 - like backpack and I got in i kind of got
20:52 - done doing homework sat down was just
20:55 - kind of relaxing and I'm gonna tell you
20:58 - guys about how I landed the client okay
21:01 - that paid me 20k in one month and then
21:03 - also the 1500 they're connected so and
21:08 - what I had done a few days before was I
21:11 - was posting on Craigslist okay of being
21:15 - a Python developer all right and check
21:17 - this out I was posting about some random
21:20 - stuff like I'm gonna tutor people in
21:22 - Python I didn't even know what I was
21:24 - doing but three few months into my just
21:27 - learning programming I was posting about
21:29 - tutoring and teaching people coaching
21:32 - people and what it ended up happening
21:34 - was somebody reached out to me that day
21:37 - called me and I picked up the phone and
21:39 - I was like who's this and then they said
21:41 - we're calling from da data company and
21:43 - they're like we need help building a
21:46 - customer relationship management system
21:48 - and at that time they didn't even
21:51 - actually know what they needed they
21:52 - didn't even call it a customer
21:54 - relationship management system like he
21:55 - was on the phone with me and he's like
21:56 - yeah we need a portal for our clients so
22:00 - they can log in and so also the
22:02 - employees can log in I'm like okay this
22:06 - said we need something that can hold the
22:08 - invoices so basically the client can see
22:11 - the invoices and then the company can
22:14 - also see them invoices and the client
22:16 - can kind of log into their own account
22:18 - to see
22:19 - and I was like okay cool and at this
22:22 - point literally the only few things I
22:24 - could do but code is like I built some
22:25 - Coursera projects okay like I had built
22:28 - take Tac Toe and rock paper scissors
22:31 - like some simple games I hadn't
22:33 - literally done any practical things yet
22:35 - and they're like also it should be able
22:39 - to handle accounting so basically as we
22:43 - go through this it should do the
22:46 - automatic and accounting automatically
22:48 - because what that will do for us to save
22:49 - us like 10 to 50 hours a week for our
22:54 - our employees doing it manually and I
22:57 - said and I was on the phone at this
23:00 - point I was like okay like that's a lot
23:04 - of stuff man like I can barely do
23:06 - anything I never even made something
23:07 - with I cannot forget accounting I hadn't
23:11 - even made something that could let you
23:13 - log in I don't know how was gonna store
23:15 - that information what happens if they
23:17 - log out how does everybody how can
23:19 - everybody go to this one website but
23:20 - then have their own account and see
23:22 - their own information and not anybody
23:24 - else's information how do I make it
23:25 - secure like what's the security issues
23:28 - that was going on so literally I was so
23:31 - lost I was like okay so this is not
23:34 - gonna be happening like I'm done I
23:37 - should just end the call and the joke
23:39 - and this funky joke and just get off the
23:42 - phone and say hey I can't do it okay but
23:44 - I kind of just amused that idea and I
23:46 - was like okay cool I can do that and
23:48 - then he said we'll also need a way where
23:52 - it can use react so that's a like a
23:57 - JavaScript framework it's a little
23:58 - complicated but basically what he said
24:00 - that that when we're sending emails it
24:02 - should look and feel really high-quality
24:04 - and essentially we should be able to
24:06 - write emails from within the software
24:09 - and we should be able to edit emails
24:11 - from within the software and so when we
24:13 - send emails and messages they can reply
24:15 - back to them and we can also see if
24:16 - they've opened the email if they've not
24:18 - opened the email if they've reviewed the
24:20 - proposal or if they've not reviewed the
24:22 - proposal have this signed it like so
24:25 - many things and if wants to sign it it's
24:27 - automatically connected with their
24:28 - accounting thing and when their
24:30 - employees get there it automatically
24:31 - checks them
24:32 - and all the information is searchable so
24:36 - for example if any of their employees
24:38 - have went to the clients home and have
24:40 - done whatever needs to be done and came
24:42 - back that information should be
24:44 - searchable okay so there are just so
24:47 - many moving parts right there's so many
24:51 - things going on and I'm like I was
24:55 - laughing I'm like there is no way that
24:57 - I'll be able to do this okay so but I
24:59 - was on the phone I was like yeah okay I
25:02 - can do it I can do it and they're like
25:03 - okay cool and they're like we saw your
25:06 - rate and that time a tutoring rate or my
25:08 - coaching rate that I put up was like
25:10 - fifty dollars an hour and I had coached
25:12 - a few students at that point and and I
25:17 - was like okay yet so he's like we've
25:20 - seen your coaching rate and so are we
25:23 - good to go can we get started this week
25:25 - and I was like yeah sure let's get
25:29 - started this week like let's do it and
25:31 - as soon as the call ended I remember
25:35 - calling my friends and I was like oh my
25:37 - god I'm like I just got this offer this
25:40 - Python like you know they didn't say a
25:42 - specific language they just said like
25:44 - they need a solution to a problem and
25:46 - I'm like okay I'm gonna use Python I'm
25:49 - gonna learn Django I don't know how to
25:51 - store information but I've heard that
25:52 - there's something to do with databases
25:54 - databases allow you to store information
25:55 - so then you can create your own account
25:57 - you can log in you can like do all this
25:59 - cool and it's not just a boring
26:01 - website that has contact pages and
26:03 - resumes this has a lot of things and I
26:06 - remember telling that to my friend my
26:07 - friends like he's like dude are you sure
26:09 - you're gonna be able to do this this
26:10 - sounds so crazy
26:12 - and I said yeah maybe I'll give it a try
26:14 - but what I want you to keep in your mind
26:17 - right now as you're listening to this is
26:19 - notice that I didn't say that I can't do
26:22 - this okay I didn't just self-sabotage
26:26 - myself even though I that time I
26:27 - couldn't do it I wanted to give it a try
26:29 - and I wanted to just say yes even though
26:31 - it sounded insane then what I did is I
26:34 - started going and like learning about
26:36 - these courses taking these courses and
26:39 - learning about something like sequel but
26:40 - basically what I've started doing was
26:41 - learning about how databases and things
26:44 - like that worked and I finally figured
26:45 - that
26:46 - and when I walked into the office the
26:48 - first day I actually had something put
26:51 - together and let me remind just a little
26:52 - bit before I got to the office the first
26:54 - time I remember it was 2:00 a.m. and I
26:56 - just learned about how I can hold a
26:58 - database with all the information of
27:01 - stuff so even if you leave this website
27:03 - and come back all the data all the new
27:05 - data that you added is there and if you
27:07 - log out and log back in everybody sees
27:09 - something different so I had just got
27:12 - that feature implemented at 3m and I
27:14 - remember I was so excited that I texted
27:17 - the person who was trying to hire me the
27:19 - recruiter or whatever like at that
27:20 - company I texted him 3m and I'm like
27:22 - sent him the video I took like a
27:25 - snapchat video and I sent him the video
27:28 - of like done you know the first part is
27:31 - already done and at this point they
27:33 - hadn't even told me to do and get
27:35 - started they said we're gonna get
27:36 - started the first time you see us but I
27:39 - was so excited I got it I got some basic
27:42 - parts of the app done and I then sent it
27:44 - out to them at 3 a.m. okay so think
27:47 - about how crazy that is all normal
27:50 - beliefs should tell you that I shouldn't
27:53 - be getting this job that they would
27:54 - think I'm too crazy that would they
27:57 - would think like this kid is insane you
27:59 - know sending stuff at like 3:00 a.m. but
28:02 - it was quite the opposite actually what
28:05 - they loved at that point was that he's
28:07 - literally not caring about the time and
28:11 - whatever and he's just putting in work
28:13 - and actually giving value without just
28:16 - necessarily being like this needy dude
28:18 - who's looking for something back all the
28:20 - time for anything that he or she does in
28:22 - return and so I send them this and at
28:26 - 3:00 4:00 a.m. he responded to me and he
28:29 - was super excited he's like this looks
28:30 - amazing he's like this is great he goes
28:33 - can't wait to see you on Monday and I
28:35 - was like all right cool
28:36 - and basically I ended up going I ended
28:39 - up meeting them and they just loved me
28:41 - and they loved the fact that I was
28:42 - already I got started and got things
28:44 - done and they even paid me for the time
28:47 - I mean also I brought it up I was like
28:49 - hey guys I've already worked for five or
28:51 - ten hours and that's my rate so this is
28:53 - you know what the bill would be for all
28:56 - the stuff that's already completed so
28:57 - again I also know
28:59 - to charge what I'm worth and not just
29:01 - wait on other people to tell me so if
29:03 - you're listening to this have a pen and
29:05 - paper with you because this is so
29:07 - important this can literally be saving
29:09 - you years of your life alright this
29:11 - could be saving years of your life right
29:15 - yes
29:16 - so this could be again saving you years
29:19 - of your life I'm gonna get to that and
29:21 - what you want to do is be taking these
29:24 - notes down and telling yourself one
29:26 - don't have these limiting beliefs okay
29:30 - don't self-sabotage yourself to provide
29:33 - value without always asking for
29:36 - something in return three charge what
29:38 - you're worth and kind of be firm about
29:40 - it okay so know what you should be
29:43 - charging don't just let people walk all
29:44 - over you super super important I've had
29:47 - so many friends you know who don't
29:50 - charge what they should be charging even
29:53 - though they're more talented and when we
29:56 - tell them we can help them and help them
29:57 - increase that rate instead they fight us
30:00 - and tell us why they don't deserve to
30:03 - have a higher rate or they don't deserve
30:05 - to have that better job and how this is
30:07 - actually helping them but being at this
30:09 - lower level job so again guys a lot of
30:11 - mental stuff that's gonna be stopping
30:13 - you
30:13 - alright so write these down as you're
30:16 - listening to this okay so now I've
30:20 - already got this it's done they're
30:22 - already paying me fifty dollars an hour
30:23 - everything is going good but then I
30:27 - talked to my mentor okay at that time my
30:30 - mentor was Nick okay and Nick is awesome
30:35 - his name is Nick drain if you find him
30:37 - on github or something like that
30:40 - I don't know you'll probably find him he
30:41 - currently is working at full stack
30:44 - Academy coding boot camp and I just gave
30:47 - all his information away enjoy Nick and
30:50 - basically he was my ultimate mentor he
30:55 - helped me accelerate my progress by
30:57 - literally years I swear to God
31:00 - if I didn't have him mentoring me I
31:02 - would be years and years behind like all
31:04 - this content that you guys see now and
31:05 - all this programming stuff that you guys
31:08 - get now from clever programmer there's
31:09 - no way you would be seeing this in like
31:11 - five to ten years from now
31:14 - so basically what I want you guys to be
31:17 - doing is you know as you're listening
31:20 - again be following along so my mentor
31:23 - Nick he was teaching me all these things
31:25 - and helping me and at that point I'm
31:27 - like okay I could rely and rely on him
31:29 - for help because what he was for me was
31:33 - a trusted adviser okay
31:36 - he wasn't just like this needy
31:37 - freelancer or just somebody who's trying
31:39 - to help me forgetting something in
31:41 - return and I was doing the same thing I
31:43 - was like this hungry hungry student and
31:45 - I would do anything he wants but in
31:47 - return as long as he could help me learn
31:49 - coding and that's the kind of the same
31:51 - way I went in when I was working with
31:53 - this company I went in as a trusted
31:55 - adviser and you know instead of this
31:59 - needy weird freelancer thing going on
32:01 - okay so that's another thing you should
32:02 - write down and I always brought them
32:04 - more value without even thinking about
32:08 - what I'm always getting back in return
32:10 - so going back I called Nick and I was
32:13 - like this is so exciting I got a
32:16 - full-time position for something that I
32:20 - would do for free and not only would I
32:23 - do it for free and enjoy building that
32:26 - software okay
32:27 - like out of my mind enjoy building a
32:29 - software I would literally pay money out
32:32 - of my pocket to get to work on such an
32:36 - awesome project okay
32:38 - so think about that for a second I would
32:40 - pay money out of my pocket to work on a
32:43 - project like that and here I was not
32:45 - only getting to work here where I'm
32:48 - paying to do this not getting to work
32:50 - here as an intern where I'm doing this
32:52 - for free but getting to work here where
32:54 - I'm paid so I was literally going crazy
32:58 - and I would always be doing math I'm
32:59 - like oh my god fifty dollars an hour and
33:02 - five hours that's like this much money
33:04 - and in ten hours it's like five hundred
33:06 - dollars in like two days I make like a
33:08 - thousand dollars this is insane like I
33:11 - go for a lunch break and I come back and
33:13 - I've made like 100 bucks I'm like this
33:15 - is just unreal I don't know what how
33:17 - this is happening and I called my mentor
33:20 - and I was like I'm making $50 an hour I
33:22 - got this job this is so cool right and
33:24 - he goes how much are they paying you
33:26 - and I'm like fifty bucks and he goes for
33:33 - somebody who's he goes granted you're
33:35 - new and you don't have any experience
33:37 - and you're starting out he goes still he
33:41 - goes if you're doing work as an
33:43 - independent contractor he goes you
33:44 - should be charging twice or three times
33:46 - as much and I'm like what he's like
33:50 - especially for software developers and
33:51 - he said specially for Python developers
33:54 - and I was listening to this and I was
33:55 - like are you serious
33:58 - $100 $100 me an hour like this is a
34:02 - full-time thing or at least I was
34:06 - getting 20 to 30 hours of work from them
34:08 - and he goes yeah you should do it and
34:12 - I'm like just call them like right now
34:14 - and he goes yeah and I remember getting
34:18 - off the call at that time okay I got off
34:22 - the call and hung up and I was like
34:24 - freaking out because at this point I'm
34:27 - supposed to be calling Nick and talking
34:29 - with him and I remember literally like
34:31 - my hands were shaking you know I was
34:36 - shaking because think about this I'm
34:40 - getting this amazing opportunity
34:42 - somebody's paying me what I want it's
34:44 - way better than anybody dreams of when I
34:47 - told this to my friends at that time in
34:49 - college who are making $8 an hour $10 an
34:52 - hour I mean to them is just on freaking
34:55 - real and they're like you must be greedy
34:57 - as hell to be wanting more when I told
34:59 - this to my parents they're like be
35:01 - thankful for what you're getting when I
35:05 - told this to my brothers and ask them
35:06 - for adviser like be happy with what
35:09 - you're making and then you know making
35:10 - more comes with experience and a lot of
35:12 - years and years and years and a lot of
35:16 - education you haven't even graduated yet
35:18 - and you're at a community college just
35:19 - be thankful thankful and so there were
35:22 - all these people telling me not to go
35:25 - for more money and then I had Nick
35:27 - telling me of course
35:29 - $100 not even a question done and so you
35:35 - can imagine at the age of like what 2021
35:37 - sitting here to some
35:39 - an opportunity really thinking what I
35:41 - should do but here's something that
35:44 - helped me in my decision I already had a
35:47 - bunch of clients that I was coaching
35:49 - okay and making good money from that so
35:53 - I wasn't so dependent on how this went
35:57 - and even if I was I would still do this
36:00 - the same exact way
36:05 - shaking kind of getting worried of
36:07 - scared and then I got upstairs took out
36:11 - my phone and then I'm like God on this
36:14 - call okay
36:15 - and they didn't pick up I called again
36:21 - the second time always call twice that's
36:23 - another thing write it down okay if
36:25 - you're listening to just write it down
36:26 - always call twice anybody are calling
36:28 - curiosity is a people want to know
36:31 - what you're talking about and some most
36:33 - of the times when people ignore it's not
36:35 - because they're not there but it's
36:37 - because they just sometimes ignore it
36:40 - okay because they're talking to somebody
36:42 - they don't think it's that important so
36:43 - call twice call twice he picks up on the
36:47 - other end and I'm like hey so the $50 an
36:51 - hour rate is actually my coaching rate
36:56 - and my tutoring rate but my consulting
36:59 - rate to work with the client is actually
37:02 - $100 an hour and then on the other end
37:09 - it was kind of just like this what you
37:12 - feel right now just and literally look
37:16 - my hands were kind of shaking and I just
37:18 - heard nothing from the other end and I'm
37:21 - sitting there I'm like oh oh
37:22 - like what's going on I'm like really
37:25 - scared at this point and then he
37:28 - responds and he says okay sounds good
37:32 - let us get back to you on this hung up
37:35 - and then I didn't hear for full 24 hours
37:37 - later and so at this point I'm freaking
37:40 - out but I'm trying to keep calm just
37:41 - going about my day and I'm like this
37:43 - doesn't happen that's okay
37:45 - learning experience okay this is like a
37:47 - reference so I'll learn it and I'll keep
37:49 - this in my mental note and move on from
37:52 - there
37:52 - as I have to learn how to negotiate if I
37:55 - can negotiate literally if I'm going
37:57 - from fifty to hundred dollars an hour
37:59 - don't just think of it as one job going
38:00 - from 50 to 100 an hour what this means
38:03 - it is I'm saving half of my life for
38:06 - fifty dollars an hour let's just say in
38:09 - a year I'm just throwing out round
38:10 - numbers that like just to simplify it
38:12 - but let's say you make fifty thousand
38:13 - dollars in one year but if you can just
38:16 - get on one uncomfortable phone call and
38:18 - make hundred dollars an hour and let's
38:20 - say now at the end of the year somehow
38:21 - you're making 100k a year you've doubled
38:24 - your time the same amount you've doubled
38:27 - the money you make and the same amount
38:29 - of time the work that would take you two
38:32 - years now takes you one year the work
38:34 - that would take you ten years now takes
38:35 - you five years all right so not only is
38:39 - this gonna be giving you the lifestyle
38:40 - that you want okay
38:43 - not only is it going to be adding that
38:44 - side income that you want or whatever
38:47 - this is also gonna be helping you spend
38:49 - time with your friends and family that
38:51 - you love okay so keep in mind why more
38:55 - money is important okay it's not just
38:57 - we're gonna be sitting on this pile of
38:59 - cash okay the main goal is that you go
39:02 - out you have fun you buy your friend
39:04 - bunch of things you buy gifts for your
39:06 - mom your girlfriend whoever without
39:08 - having to have that guilt of like I
39:10 - really need to check my bank account but
39:14 - I shouldn't write that guilt but instead
39:17 - in this case you're more like I'm not
39:20 - gonna check my bank account because I
39:21 - don't have to okay I know I'm good so
39:24 - that peace of mind is really the most
39:26 - important thing so anyways they got back
39:29 - to me 24 hours later and I just see this
39:31 - long text from my preview of the phone
39:33 - so I'm like walking in coming back again
39:35 - from Oakland Community College and in in
39:39 - this time between in this 24 hours I've
39:41 - gotten so much heat from my family I've
39:44 - gotten so much heat from my friends and
39:46 - they're just like you don't deserve this
39:48 - you just looked a gift horse in the
39:50 - mouth you had this amazing opportunity
39:51 - and you just ruined it you always want
39:54 - more all this crazy nonsense okay got
39:58 - home saw this big preview kinda had a
40:02 - feeling what was going on but wasn't
40:04 - sure and then ultimately
40:06 - realize who I'm talking is YouTube so
40:08 - I'm on Instagram Facebook there and I'm
40:11 - talking to YouTube right now and I see
40:16 - this message I go through it and
40:17 - basically long story short the message
40:21 - was pretty much congratulations all
40:23 - right
40:24 - those congratulations you got it okay
40:27 - and I remember reading that I just like
40:34 - literally skim through all the text
40:36 - didn't even read what the text was about
40:38 - just read the part that said like
40:39 - congratulations we'll start this
40:42 - Wednesday I'm like oh oh my god what the
40:50 - hell just happened like what just
40:51 - happened I literally half to my life
40:54 - like half the lifetime of work that I
40:56 - need to do negotiated something
40:59 - absolutely insane sat through this I
41:01 - just couldn't believe it
41:02 - and I didn't tell anybody for a while
41:05 - for that day for a few hours people were
41:08 - just like why are you sitting like this
41:10 - why are you so shocked why do you look
41:12 - traumatized cause II like I would just
41:14 - go I hung out with my friends and I was
41:16 - just shocked or lookin at them not even
41:19 - speaking and now finally you know I let
41:22 - the cat out of the bag or cat out of the
41:25 - hat I don't know what the expression is
41:26 - but um I told them that this was the
41:30 - case and every single person who had
41:34 - told me don't do it and had given me
41:36 -  for it was just kind of looking at
41:39 - me incredibly shocked but I'm not the
41:42 - person to tell you I told you so or
41:44 - whatever I don't even make a few people
41:46 - feel guilty so I'm just like yeah I got
41:48 - it you know just like you said I would
41:50 - and they're like yeah yeah you know I
41:52 - believed in you yeah of course like we
41:54 - knew you could do it I mean don't you
41:56 - think we knew you could do it and then
41:57 - they're like yeah of course we knew but
41:59 - even though that didn't say that at all
42:01 - when I was going through that and Nick
42:03 - was like of course why wouldn't they pay
42:05 - you hundred dollars an hour he's like of
42:06 - course so unbelievable situation for me
42:11 - okay again remember where I'm coming
42:13 - from for those of you who are just
42:14 - tuning in you know Oakland Community
42:17 - College student 2.5
42:20 - GPA 19 a CT out of 36 19 is so bad
42:25 - you're borderline really dumb okay and
42:31 - now I'm learning Python development I
42:34 - find that I'm actually good at something
42:35 - even though I wasn't good at math I
42:38 - spent a lot of time figuring out coding
42:41 - and I'm like I'm good at this and then
42:45 - getting paid what I deserve
42:47 - maybe at that time maybe even slightly
42:49 - more than a dessert but I don't know cuz
42:51 - now that I look back at it how hard I
42:53 - work and how diligently I worked and how
42:55 - much value I provided around the clock
42:57 - without thinking even about time I think
43:00 - I deserved that Pape and another thing I
43:05 - want you guys note down is think about
43:08 - what having a mentor can do for you okay
43:12 - so having that mentor versus everybody
43:15 - else literally changed my life
43:17 - increased me two times the speed of what
43:21 - my life would normally go at okay with
43:24 - just one word that he told me and also
43:27 - how he taught me software development so
43:29 - if you don't have a mentor in your life
43:31 - you know look around and see if you can
43:34 - find one okay try to find one you don't
43:36 - always have to pay them but if you even
43:40 - go to meetup groups and even go to local
43:42 - events and just hang around like-minded
43:44 - people you can be learning a lot a lot a
43:47 - lot from them so make sure that you
43:49 - write all of this stuff down okay cool
43:52 - how was that did you guys like hearing
43:56 - that was that valuable for you guys
43:58 - valuable let me know
44:06 - huh
44:16 - exactly --part says here I am with a 3.5
44:19 - GPA going to college worried who else
44:22 - feels like that you know who else feels
44:24 - like they're busting their ass at school
44:26 - or whatever it is you know maybe a job
44:30 - but just either aren't getting paid what
44:32 - you deserve right or you feel like you
44:36 - need years of experience and you just
44:38 - need to spend five to ten years and you
44:41 - need to at least have a point port 4.0
44:44 - GPA you need to at least go to Harvard
44:46 - before you even start thinking about
44:48 - getting paid what you deserve
45:01 - yeah I mean if for me it was like one of
45:05 - the most powerful lessons of my entire
45:08 - life of my entire life and you know
45:12 - that's really the main one of the main
45:14 - things I wanted to share with you and
45:15 - how that just changes everything and
45:17 - then when I was making this much money
45:19 - and imagine imagine like I'm again at
45:23 - this time I don't really have any time
45:25 - because I'm going full-time to college I
45:27 - was also coaching students for chess and
45:30 - coding and then I'm also doing this big
45:33 - freelancing thing okay now imagine I am
45:38 - young I'm doing all these other things
45:40 - that I'm doing only have a few hours to
45:42 - work on coding on building software and
45:45 - it's so much fun that I would pay to do
45:47 - it here I was getting paid to do it
45:50 - add age of 20 or 21 I get to travel and
45:56 - I'm going to places like when it was my
45:58 - nephew's birthday and it was actually
46:01 - like literally birthday like as in my
46:04 - nephew was born all right
46:06 - he's adorable he's like two now he's
46:09 - gonna be to actually November 23rd and
46:10 - I'm gonna fly out again right when he
46:13 - was born I got to fly out I didn't have
46:15 - to rely on my family I'd have to rely on
46:18 - my friends as a 21 year old you got to
46:20 - leave just fly out pay for my own self
46:24 - not have my brother or family to pay for
46:27 - me not have my friends pay for me and go
46:30 - visit my brother see my little nephew
46:33 - okay at the hospital and that was just
46:37 - an unbelievable experience I have photos
46:39 - of everything and I'll show you guys
46:40 - where it's a lot easier because right
46:42 - now it's hard for me to excrete share or
46:43 - whatever but uh literally you know got
46:46 - to play with them and as I was doing
46:48 - that I would just be sneaking in some
46:50 - work I'm sitting at the hospital okay
46:52 - and while the nurses are talking or
46:55 - whatever and everybody else is busy I'm
46:57 - literally sitting in the waiting room
46:59 - and talking with my family I have my
47:01 - laptop open I have my feet kicked up on
47:03 - the table and I'm getting to work on
47:06 - something that's so fun and mentally
47:09 - stimulating and I'm getting paid for it
47:12 - I put in two hours right before
47:15 - getting into the room boom like 200
47:17 - bucks okay and again at that time that
47:20 - was so much to me and as a college
47:22 - student you can imagine that that's a
47:24 - lot and I could work from the hospital I
47:28 - could go and be at an amazing place like
47:31 - we were at so Golden Gate Bridge and we
47:34 - parked our car and we walked out and
47:35 - we're talking having a good time we
47:37 - spent many hours there and then I would
47:39 - sneak in just a few times here and there
47:41 - and just code and work on the project
47:45 - because I don't have to actually be
47:46 - there to be working on this and then
47:49 - BOOM put my computer away while
47:52 - traveling and having the time of my life
47:54 - and even the work that I was doing was
47:56 - so fun that sometimes my family and my
47:59 - friends would have to actually stop me
48:00 - from saying and from doing coding all
48:03 - the time from building things all the
48:05 - time and all this right and I got paid
48:11 - twenty thousand dollars in one month
48:13 - okay to be specific I think it was
48:15 - something like 20 or $21,000 and seven
48:18 - or twenty-one thousand seven or
48:20 - sixty-five dollars yeah something
48:23 - whatever twenty one seven three whatever
48:25 - but it was like a very specific number
48:27 - and I remembered it I forgot now but you
48:30 - know imagine one month and college
48:33 - student you have your state doing all
48:35 - these other things like you don't have
48:36 - time
48:37 - you're not smart you don't feel like
48:39 - you're good enough and then you can
48:41 - really be making a difference in the
48:43 - world providing value I was saving this
48:45 - company hundreds of hours of their time
48:47 - by the way and all this code I was
48:49 - writing was something I had learned in
48:51 - like three months
48:52 - so clearly I'm not a very good coder at
48:55 - this point because you need to really be
48:57 - spending a lot more time to be learning
48:59 - this stuff and it's still possible to
49:02 - putting these things together and this
49:03 - is when I was realizing like you can
49:06 - have an amazing life solid me traveling
49:08 - can be making money can be getting paid
49:09 - what you deserve but the big thing I
49:12 - started realizing was I have so many of
49:14 - so many people who are either graduating
49:17 - college or people who are 40 or 50 years
49:20 - old and either one they're just making
49:23 - excuses about their age or that they're
49:25 - not smart enough or the other people are
49:27 - graduate
49:28 - with colic from college accumulating
49:31 - hundreds of thousands of dollars of
49:32 - loans and then when they go to the job
49:34 - market whether they're young or old
49:36 - whether they've gone to college or not
49:38 - gone to college you know when they they
49:41 - don't have the actual skills nobody ever
49:44 - taught them the actual skills to land a
49:45 - job nobody ever taught them how to
49:47 - negotiate with a client nobody how to
49:51 - nobody taught them how to build that
49:52 - relationship and these fundamental
49:56 - skills were just missing from college
49:58 - for missing from the world of academia
50:00 - are not taught online anywhere I
50:02 - couldn't find this on udemy Coursera
50:04 - Udacity EDX and I've gone through so
50:06 - many of those courses literally
50:08 - thousands of dollars worth of courses
50:10 - and that's where I you know I learned
50:12 - from because I didn't have any better
50:13 - resources so just think about how many
50:16 - wrong things are taught and like
50:18 - popularized and like you have to be good
50:21 - at math to become a programmer and you
50:23 - have to be this go to this college to
50:26 - become a programmer and you have to have
50:28 - this and that it's just you know those
50:33 - were the things that caused me so much
50:34 - pain and I was like I want to build this
50:36 - channel literally for my younger self if
50:39 - there's somebody who is out there that
50:42 - could use this help you know and it
50:45 - could help them I don't care whether
50:46 - they're 60 years old or 10 years old
50:48 - this could help them that's all I needed
50:52 - and I wanted to show people like there's
50:55 - a there's a route of just theory and
50:57 - experience and that traditional route
51:00 - like you go to college you go to high
51:02 - school you go to college you graduate
51:05 - you get a job you get another job and
51:07 - then what happens you die okay there's
51:10 - that route and then there's another
51:13 - route where you can be very practical
51:15 - learn negotiation skills learn how to be
51:19 - likable not to work with the team and
51:21 - then 10 or 15% of your skills are made
51:24 - up of coding okay and then you're
51:28 - getting paid more you're landing jobs
51:31 - you're not accumulating loans so just
51:34 - think of it like the practical guy and
51:36 - the theoretical guy the fury guy so if
51:39 - you're not watching this right now write
51:40 - this down do you want to be the fury
51:42 - I or do you want to be the practical guy
51:44 - and if there are girls in here do you
51:47 - want to be the fury girl or the
51:49 - practical girl okay do you want to just
51:51 - learn all this weird esoteric stuff or
51:56 - do you want to figure out how can you
51:58 - give value to the client you're working
52:00 - with and how can you help them solve a
52:02 - problem save them time and save them
52:04 - money I was saving them fifty to hundred
52:07 - thousand dollars a year okay because of
52:11 - how many hours my software was saving
52:13 - them so was it easy for them to pay me
52:16 - fifty to twenty thousand dollars yes
52:19 - okay and I identified how much money I
52:23 - would be saving them and I told them I'd
52:26 - be saving them this much money and when
52:28 - I sent them the proposal and I said I'm
52:31 - gonna be saving you 50 to $100,000 and I
52:35 - think I should be paid a hundred dollars
52:36 - an hour to work on this and over the
52:39 - next that next month I had an invoice of
52:42 - twenty thousand dollars okay so also
52:46 - know what budget your client is working
52:49 - with okay like Bo where if you're
52:52 - working with the client who's building
52:54 - that next face book but he also he only
52:57 - wants to hire you as a you know freebie
53:00 - intern guy he has no budget and then you
53:02 - try to you start working with him and
53:03 - you spend all this time and then later
53:04 - you're like but put what am I gonna
53:06 - start getting paid I'm overworked and
53:08 - underpaid there's no money there he
53:10 - doesn't have money she doesn't have
53:11 - money okay they hired you on some weird
53:14 - promise and there's nothing there
53:16 - I work with a company that I knew had a
53:18 - budget I knew exactly what their budget
53:19 - was I knew exactly how much money I'd be
53:21 - making them and I knew exactly where my
53:23 - money that they're gonna be paying me is
53:26 - coming from so you see that's why the
53:29 - business skills are really important and
53:31 - if you miss out on them you're just
53:33 - gonna spend so many more years getting
53:36 - what you want because let's be realistic
53:38 - we want coding skills you want to be
53:40 - good programmers but I mean come on do
53:43 - we really really just want to do it to
53:45 - become a good programmer we want to do
53:46 - it so we can do something we love we

59:03 - we're gonna learn about objects and
59:05 - object oriented programming and let's
59:08 - instantiate a class but whoa whoa whoa
59:10 - let's not talk about how you can

59:14 - how you can actually provide value to
59:16 - people and how you could actually make a
59:18 - living off of it so you could share that
59:20 - with your friends your family and not
59:22 - feel like you're stupid okay not none of
59:26 - those classes exist okay so that's why I
59:29 - want to put this together for you so
59:31 - again highly practical I wanted to put
59:35 - this together for people who are not
59:36 - only you know yes there are people who
59:38 - don't have a job right now we're doing
59:39 - nothing and have hundreds of hours great
59:41 - you can put that in get the results
59:43 - faster but I wanted to make this for
59:45 - people who are also busy doing jobs have
59:48 - to spend time with family maybe have a
59:50 - family maybe have kids okay
59:52 - maybe our older okay yeah I don't even
59:55 - care 460 or seven years old I wanted to
59:57 - put this together for somebody who has
60:00 - all these other obligations has limited
60:02 - time maybe even two to three hours a
60:04 - week okay and so I want to make sure
60:07 - that you're getting everything that you
60:09 - need even if you're spending as little
60:10 - as two to three hours a week okay again
60:13 - you're gonna find out a lot more about
60:15 - this for now click that link and sign up
60:19 - for the free master class your
60:21 - profitable programmer master class okay
60:24 - and this we're gonna go through
60:25 - everything so the instagrams the stream
60:29 - has ended this course we're gonna be
60:33 - talking about web apps I'm not gonna go
60:34 - into what this course is about yet okay
60:37 - not gonna be doing it again take that
60:39 - free master class and you're gonna get
60:42 - just tremendous amount of value and
60:44 - everything in that master class is
60:45 - something you could take and apply right
60:47 - now if you're a guitar instructor or a
60:49 - shark hunter or I don't care what it is
60:52 - that you do right now everything that I
60:54 - always try to give in my videos is
60:56 - something you could take and apply even
60:58 - if you never become a Python developer
60:59 - okay again my goal is to help you become
61:02 - that Python developer but I want to give
61:04 - you value so you can apply this right
61:06 - off the bat okay awesome link is in the
61:13 - description so anybody who's asking me
61:15 - on facebook links in the description if
61:17 - you're on youtube link is in the
61:18 - description the link is called data the
61:21 - first client with python go to that link
61:23 - put in your email done
61:27 - there's no age restriction so to sign up
61:32 - for it there's no age restriction if
61:33 - you're young you can sign up for it if
61:35 - you're all you can sign up for it okay
61:38 - again if you have listened to my story
61:41 - today you know that those are just
61:42 - limiting beliefs okay
61:46 - that's like self sabotaging yourself if
61:48 - you listen to my story you've learned
61:50 - that I believed in myself even though I
61:55 - didn't have those skills at that point
61:57 - and I believed in myself even when my
62:00 - whole family and all my friends were
62:02 - against what I was doing which was
62:05 - negotiating a higher
62:06 - Gallery or doing work outside of just
62:09 - school or you know learning how I was
62:13 - learning okay so again don't take that
62:17 - traditional path because that only tells
62:19 - you you have to spend six years learning
62:21 - you have to spend the next ten years
62:23 - getting experience and then you can
62:25 - maybe charge $30 an hour believe it or
62:28 - not there are a lot of like just look
62:30 - online okay go to places like upward
62:32 - comm code mentor and just look at how
62:35 - many talented talented programmers there
62:37 - are 30 40 years of experience I'm
62:39 - talking okay there are legendary
62:42 - programmers way better than I'll ever be
62:44 - okay again and I'm not an expert and

Cleaned transcript:

that's really i'm live online alright let's do this thing let's bring this here oh I'm not actually live on Instagram yet hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom awesome this is amazing bunch of you guys are here don't know how many yet but I will find out in a second looks like zero people are watching is that true okay so we have a few people here that's good we have a few people going on Instagram awesome ok great to have you guys here settle in guys so today we're gonna be talking about your number one secret to become a Python profitable massively profitable programmer okay and why it's critical that you must start now so what I want you to do is kind of buckle in alright get some popcorn get some coffee kind of like I got here from Dunkin Donuts and just sit back and kind of enjoy alright we're gonna be covering did you make sure that it the landscape mode is unlocked because if you don't do that it'll like mess up the whole thing so end it and then order just yeah figure it out awesome cool alright so what we're doing today is we're actually gonna be live on YouTube we're also going live on Instagram and we're gonna be going live on Facebook and I'm lucky to have my friends here today helping me because usually it's like there's too many things going on it gets really confusing and so today it's gonna be a lot simpler alright okay so guys make sure that what you start doing is also start posting your questions and I want you to start thinking of the types of questions you're gonna be asking all right and so then later when we get into kind of like the Q&A section a little bit I want to get your most burning questions and answer them for you while I have you here okay I want to do that and in this livestream what I'm gonna be covering I'm gonna be going over a lot of what a Python developers lifestyle is like I want to tell you how I negotiated you know going from $50 an hour to $100 an hour in one phone call I'm gonna tell you about one of my first Python jobs that I ended up landing where I made twenty plus thousand dollars in less than one month and the reason why I'm gonna be giving you guys this information is so you guys can see how you can apply this to yourself all right so I'm gonna be saying it from my perspective but I want you to constantly be thinking how it could be you in that position okay because all of these things I'm telling you are you know when I was not a very good developer I was just a few months in to learning about programming and at that time I was going through the same things of being just like super frustrated not being able to figure out what the hell programming is and grasping my mind around a ton of concepts so for example things like okay I have these coding skills I can do if statements I can do print and I can do you know some basic coding exercises on platforms like hacker rank or I've gone through some courses on Coursera Udacity but I was always confused as to how do I take those concepts and then actually build realworld apps with them and how do I go from you know just knowing code to actually building real apps and how do I go from that then actually charging people and making money making a living off of it and then living a comfortable lifestyle and then how do I go about hiring and firing my clients something that you can do too so you don't have to work with clients that you do not like all right so we're gonna be getting deep into many many many pain points and also we're gonna be covering a lot of things that give you value as soon as you step out of this livestream okay we can even call this a workshop so I want to give you value as soon as you leave and give you many many things to take away all right so again kind of relax and enjoy and we're gonna be going through all of this okay and how is the audio coming around for you guys are you guys able to hear me a lot clearer let me turn up the gain on this thing okay could I add some volume all right I'll do that all right my mic is working that's good and I'll turn up my gain and I'll also talk from a little bit closer okay clear okay beautiful now I'm okay on Instagram it's clear that's good Instagram volume is coming out of my phone and then we're basically figuring out right now how to set up Facebook that's taking a while and we're just gonna make sure that that's good to go in a second so sorry still working on that guys and then we are I think should be better on YouTube how are we doing Tenzin give me a little thumbs up or something okay okay cool all right beautiful we have quite a few people on our YouTube and we have a few people on our can you frame it right okay awesome like and then just make it a little bit taller just just here just like right to there and then you know just cool alright need to be doing more of these all right now I should be going live and I should be live on Facebook hello Facebook how's it going Facebook Instagram YouTube all right we are live everywhere again this is your number one secret okay then I'm gonna be sharing today to profit with Python okay this is your workshop that we're gonna be going through today and why it's critical that you must start on this right now all right uhhuh and I'm gonna be sharing those things as we go along so first of all let's talk about the job opportunity for software developers and how this market is growing and what your future can be looking like okay what the job opportunities are so right now okay even according to Forbes Python is the number one language of 2017 okay so this is a good year for us and by 2020 it's actually going even higher all right it's going to be staying at the top and beating out all other languages so I am kind of excited about that some other amazing things about this language programming language is like think about all of the things that are made with this okay so this is something I've mentioned before but I'm gonna mention it again for everybody maybe you missed it alright so again platforms big huge platforms are built with this language okay so Instagram where you are on right now is built with Python okay YouTube where you are right now is built with Python and I don't think there's a lot of Python used in Facebook right tenzin that's not true in facebook right okay so there are a lot of languages and even in Facebook there's a little bit of Python Spotify is built off of Python reddit is built off of Python Hipmunk is built off of Python okay events Brite is built off of Python so think about all the things that are built with Python do you guys know what Google is built with Python all right and Sergey grinned the CEO of Google said Python where we can see where we must alright so with all these big platforms and these platforms that are only growing all right we all have like billions of users using Instagram Facebook YouTube Google reddit Spotify and with these platforms only growing what this means is that there is simply more room alright there's simply more room for more programmers more Python developers to have those jobs ok and again why I emphasize Python so much is because it's at the perfect intersection essentially of being the easiest programming language all right being the most growing and trending programming languages and being one of the most paid programming languages ok average Python developer makes anywhere from ninety to a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year even more okay and it even and it depends where you live okay so if you're living in places like California in the heart of where the technologies that you can be even making more money okay and if you're living somewhere we're like Kazi I'm not getting and if you're living in a place where it's like Kazi there isn't much going on here we can't network with people for programming we can't find jobs for programming we can't find where we can get independent contractor work for programming you know what you should do you know what you should do obviously one stop making excuses and two you know what you should do leave that place relocate okay if that is the case like just the other day this reminds me I was on sorry I'm just gonna check if the audio is coming off well on YouTube coming off good audio yeah all right so we got good audio going awesome alright so if you're gonna leave and also sometimes like I'm talking take where I'm at because sometimes I forget so I just remind me thank you okay so basically when you're what so we either relocate right but don't make excuses and the reason why I'm kind of going off on this tangent is yesterday I shared one of my youtube videos which is what would I do if I were 18 again and you know it's I called it like your explosive four four secrets to your explosive career growth you know which is true and in that video I mentioned you should be doing things like creating content and sharing with the world and contributing to the world instead of just thinking procrastinating and lingering and then I had somebody who said cause II I'm 40 years old maybe this is something that works for a 22 year old but I don't think this works for a 40 year old and so I saw that message and I'm like okay this is pretty interesting and also he complained that he was 40 so he said he was too old to get started and it'll take too long but then I told him look my story maybe should even motivate you because most of the results clever programmer went from having nobody zero subscribers right to having hundred thousand subscribers followers I got value out of it right if you're here you probably at some point got value out of it and so I told him that and I said look it means it possible for you to get these results in one year and you know what he told me back he replied and he goes well may I could get this in one year but he goes I'm living in places like New York San Fran and Washington DC he goes if you're forty or too old so you can't get that and then at that point I'm like if you're gonna just victimize yourself and look I'm on your side I'm trying to help him trying to motivate you and I'm trying to tell you it's possible I'm not just motivating you for the sake of motivating you I don't like doing that right if I but it's possible and it's not even that hard to do so why are you just putting these limits and restrictions on your own mind and stopping yourself from achieving these goals it's just kind of toxic and so I said like look you're just kind of putting limiting beliefs but then again he just kept going and arguing and at that point I was like okay you argue as to why you will never ever ever ever succeed you know I'm on your side but you're gonna argue that you're not gonna succeed so at that point I can't help you so if you're watching this remember that a lot of it has to do with your mindset okay where is your mind at if you don't think you deserve a lot of money or you don't think you deserve that Python development job you then won't get it okay you don't actually then deserve it so you have to change a lot of how you rewire your brain okay you have to kind of rewire that thing all right so we've hit on why Python is beating all other big programming languages and why it's so so so so so good okay it starts from if you're in a complete beginner you can learn super fast but if you're not just a beginner you know another benefit of it is companies like Instagram YouTube Google reddit spot if I built off with it so it means that there are just tons and tons of jobs the jobs are never going away it's only increasing at an exponential rate okay as long as platforms like Google reddit YouTube Spotify Hipmunk Eventbrite dadadadada as long as they keep growing the number of job opportunities for Python developers will only keep growing right and even when you get into artificial intelligence software developers are the ones that are running it I mean look at scan and go at Walmart all right it's replacing the people there guess whose scan and go is programmed by by programmers okay it's something that's actually programmed look at Google car selfdriving cars programmers have to actually program that to work Tesla all right your phones your iPhone your snapchat like every single thing there's code running it every online platform that you're using so to think that it's something that's gonna die off in a few years or it's a dying career it's just a complete fallacy like a logical fallacy all right so now I kind of want to share with you guys my you know my story of how I went from getting that negotiating that $50 to $100 deal okay I literally went from making $50 an hour to $100 an hour with one phone call all right and I want to share that story with you and you're gonna learn a ton from it you can literally take this and apply to exactly what you're doing right now whatever company you're working in right now this has the potential to give you that race raise race give you that boost in your salary or maybe you're a freelancer and it can give you the boost in the money you're making and how comfortable you're living right now because because again the reason why we want to be earning more and getting paid over just what we deserve is not just for the sake of money itself right we want to take care of those around us we want to take care of our families we want to be able to support not only ourselves but the other people that we have in our lives because I think personally that it's selfish to only make enough to keep yourself happy okay I think that we should be focusing on making enough to kind of have everybody live that comfortable lifestyle around us so we can kind of help them if they need okay so this is why I think it's really important that you get actually paid what you deserve and that you're not overworked and underpaid okay that's my number one thing even if you leave this and you're like I'm never gonna touch Python or I'm never gonna touch programming I want you to be a I want you to be able to apply this in your life so tell me right now Instagram Facebook YouTube are you ready to hear the story are you ready to hear the story where I went from fifty to a hundred dollars an hour where I literally saved half of my life where I saved half of the years of my life you know kind of doing that because if you think about it normally you would go fifty debt it up and go all the way up and you would be spending twice as long and again this was when I was a beginner this was when I was just starting out okay this was when I didn't even have the programming skills that I do today I'm still not an expert okay I'm still not an expert having worked at a big company went to Community College 2.5 GPA bad student but here's what I have been doing I have been making over a hundred and four thousand dollars starting at sophomore year at Oakton Community College okay so I'm not a good student but I do know how to provide value to people in the world and I do know how to get other people results okay and I want to share that with you so again are you ready if you are I want to be hearing a hell yeah all right we're getting some hell yes let's put this Facebook one just a little bit higher cuz it's like my hair's cutting off and my hair just looks so good today I want to make sure that it's seen all right just like you know just taller like okay there we go cool cuckooland you know dishes okay all right so here's the story okay buckle and buttercups let's go all right so here here it is let me let me grab some coffee in the meantime all you guys just you know wait for the story everybody's hooked man okay so here we go I had just gotten back from my Community College okay my Oakton Community College not exactly Harvard and I was wearing my like backpack and I got in i kind of got done doing homework sat down was just kind of relaxing and I'm gonna tell you guys about how I landed the client okay that paid me 20k in one month and then also the 1500 they're connected so and what I had done a few days before was I was posting on Craigslist okay of being a Python developer all right and check this out I was posting about some random stuff like I'm gonna tutor people in Python I didn't even know what I was doing but three few months into my just learning programming I was posting about tutoring and teaching people coaching people and what it ended up happening was somebody reached out to me that day called me and I picked up the phone and I was like who's this and then they said we're calling from da data company and they're like we need help building a customer relationship management system and at that time they didn't even actually know what they needed they didn't even call it a customer relationship management system like he was on the phone with me and he's like yeah we need a portal for our clients so they can log in and so also the employees can log in I'm like okay this said we need something that can hold the invoices so basically the client can see the invoices and then the company can also see them invoices and the client can kind of log into their own account to see and I was like okay cool and at this point literally the only few things I could do but code is like I built some Coursera projects okay like I had built take Tac Toe and rock paper scissors like some simple games I hadn't literally done any practical things yet and they're like also it should be able to handle accounting so basically as we go through this it should do the automatic and accounting automatically because what that will do for us to save us like 10 to 50 hours a week for our our employees doing it manually and I said and I was on the phone at this point I was like okay like that's a lot of stuff man like I can barely do anything I never even made something with I cannot forget accounting I hadn't even made something that could let you log in I don't know how was gonna store that information what happens if they log out how does everybody how can everybody go to this one website but then have their own account and see their own information and not anybody else's information how do I make it secure like what's the security issues that was going on so literally I was so lost I was like okay so this is not gonna be happening like I'm done I should just end the call and the joke and this funky joke and just get off the phone and say hey I can't do it okay but I kind of just amused that idea and I was like okay cool I can do that and then he said we'll also need a way where it can use react so that's a like a JavaScript framework it's a little complicated but basically what he said that that when we're sending emails it should look and feel really highquality and essentially we should be able to write emails from within the software and we should be able to edit emails from within the software and so when we send emails and messages they can reply back to them and we can also see if they've opened the email if they've not opened the email if they've reviewed the proposal or if they've not reviewed the proposal have this signed it like so many things and if wants to sign it it's automatically connected with their accounting thing and when their employees get there it automatically checks them and all the information is searchable so for example if any of their employees have went to the clients home and have done whatever needs to be done and came back that information should be searchable okay so there are just so many moving parts right there's so many things going on and I'm like I was laughing I'm like there is no way that I'll be able to do this okay so but I was on the phone I was like yeah okay I can do it I can do it and they're like okay cool and they're like we saw your rate and that time a tutoring rate or my coaching rate that I put up was like fifty dollars an hour and I had coached a few students at that point and and I was like okay yet so he's like we've seen your coaching rate and so are we good to go can we get started this week and I was like yeah sure let's get started this week like let's do it and as soon as the call ended I remember calling my friends and I was like oh my god I'm like I just got this offer this Python like you know they didn't say a specific language they just said like they need a solution to a problem and I'm like okay I'm gonna use Python I'm gonna learn Django I don't know how to store information but I've heard that there's something to do with databases databases allow you to store information so then you can create your own account you can log in you can like do all this cool and it's not just a boring website that has contact pages and resumes this has a lot of things and I remember telling that to my friend my friends like he's like dude are you sure you're gonna be able to do this this sounds so crazy and I said yeah maybe I'll give it a try but what I want you to keep in your mind right now as you're listening to this is notice that I didn't say that I can't do this okay I didn't just selfsabotage myself even though I that time I couldn't do it I wanted to give it a try and I wanted to just say yes even though it sounded insane then what I did is I started going and like learning about these courses taking these courses and learning about something like sequel but basically what I've started doing was learning about how databases and things like that worked and I finally figured that and when I walked into the office the first day I actually had something put together and let me remind just a little bit before I got to the office the first time I remember it was 200 a.m. and I just learned about how I can hold a database with all the information of stuff so even if you leave this website and come back all the data all the new data that you added is there and if you log out and log back in everybody sees something different so I had just got that feature implemented at 3m and I remember I was so excited that I texted the person who was trying to hire me the recruiter or whatever like at that company I texted him 3m and I'm like sent him the video I took like a snapchat video and I sent him the video of like done you know the first part is already done and at this point they hadn't even told me to do and get started they said we're gonna get started the first time you see us but I was so excited I got it I got some basic parts of the app done and I then sent it out to them at 3 a.m. okay so think about how crazy that is all normal beliefs should tell you that I shouldn't be getting this job that they would think I'm too crazy that would they would think like this kid is insane you know sending stuff at like 300 a.m. but it was quite the opposite actually what they loved at that point was that he's literally not caring about the time and whatever and he's just putting in work and actually giving value without just necessarily being like this needy dude who's looking for something back all the time for anything that he or she does in return and so I send them this and at 300 400 a.m. he responded to me and he was super excited he's like this looks amazing he's like this is great he goes can't wait to see you on Monday and I was like all right cool and basically I ended up going I ended up meeting them and they just loved me and they loved the fact that I was already I got started and got things done and they even paid me for the time I mean also I brought it up I was like hey guys I've already worked for five or ten hours and that's my rate so this is you know what the bill would be for all the stuff that's already completed so again I also know to charge what I'm worth and not just wait on other people to tell me so if you're listening to this have a pen and paper with you because this is so important this can literally be saving you years of your life alright this could be saving years of your life right yes so this could be again saving you years of your life I'm gonna get to that and what you want to do is be taking these notes down and telling yourself one don't have these limiting beliefs okay don't selfsabotage yourself to provide value without always asking for something in return three charge what you're worth and kind of be firm about it okay so know what you should be charging don't just let people walk all over you super super important I've had so many friends you know who don't charge what they should be charging even though they're more talented and when we tell them we can help them and help them increase that rate instead they fight us and tell us why they don't deserve to have a higher rate or they don't deserve to have that better job and how this is actually helping them but being at this lower level job so again guys a lot of mental stuff that's gonna be stopping you alright so write these down as you're listening to this okay so now I've already got this it's done they're already paying me fifty dollars an hour everything is going good but then I talked to my mentor okay at that time my mentor was Nick okay and Nick is awesome his name is Nick drain if you find him on github or something like that I don't know you'll probably find him he currently is working at full stack Academy coding boot camp and I just gave all his information away enjoy Nick and basically he was my ultimate mentor he helped me accelerate my progress by literally years I swear to God if I didn't have him mentoring me I would be years and years behind like all this content that you guys see now and all this programming stuff that you guys get now from clever programmer there's no way you would be seeing this in like five to ten years from now so basically what I want you guys to be doing is you know as you're listening again be following along so my mentor Nick he was teaching me all these things and helping me and at that point I'm like okay I could rely and rely on him for help because what he was for me was a trusted adviser okay he wasn't just like this needy freelancer or just somebody who's trying to help me forgetting something in return and I was doing the same thing I was like this hungry hungry student and I would do anything he wants but in return as long as he could help me learn coding and that's the kind of the same way I went in when I was working with this company I went in as a trusted adviser and you know instead of this needy weird freelancer thing going on okay so that's another thing you should write down and I always brought them more value without even thinking about what I'm always getting back in return so going back I called Nick and I was like this is so exciting I got a fulltime position for something that I would do for free and not only would I do it for free and enjoy building that software okay like out of my mind enjoy building a software I would literally pay money out of my pocket to get to work on such an awesome project okay so think about that for a second I would pay money out of my pocket to work on a project like that and here I was not only getting to work here where I'm paying to do this not getting to work here as an intern where I'm doing this for free but getting to work here where I'm paid so I was literally going crazy and I would always be doing math I'm like oh my god fifty dollars an hour and five hours that's like this much money and in ten hours it's like five hundred dollars in like two days I make like a thousand dollars this is insane like I go for a lunch break and I come back and I've made like 100 bucks I'm like this is just unreal I don't know what how this is happening and I called my mentor and I was like I'm making $50 an hour I got this job this is so cool right and he goes how much are they paying you and I'm like fifty bucks and he goes for somebody who's he goes granted you're new and you don't have any experience and you're starting out he goes still he goes if you're doing work as an independent contractor he goes you should be charging twice or three times as much and I'm like what he's like especially for software developers and he said specially for Python developers and I was listening to this and I was like are you serious $100 $100 me an hour like this is a fulltime thing or at least I was getting 20 to 30 hours of work from them and he goes yeah you should do it and I'm like just call them like right now and he goes yeah and I remember getting off the call at that time okay I got off the call and hung up and I was like freaking out because at this point I'm supposed to be calling Nick and talking with him and I remember literally like my hands were shaking you know I was shaking because think about this I'm getting this amazing opportunity somebody's paying me what I want it's way better than anybody dreams of when I told this to my friends at that time in college who are making $8 an hour $10 an hour I mean to them is just on freaking real and they're like you must be greedy as hell to be wanting more when I told this to my parents they're like be thankful for what you're getting when I told this to my brothers and ask them for adviser like be happy with what you're making and then you know making more comes with experience and a lot of years and years and years and a lot of education you haven't even graduated yet and you're at a community college just be thankful thankful and so there were all these people telling me not to go for more money and then I had Nick telling me of course $100 not even a question done and so you can imagine at the age of like what 2021 sitting here to some an opportunity really thinking what I should do but here's something that helped me in my decision I already had a bunch of clients that I was coaching okay and making good money from that so I wasn't so dependent on how this went and even if I was I would still do this the same exact way shaking kind of getting worried of scared and then I got upstairs took out my phone and then I'm like God on this call okay and they didn't pick up I called again the second time always call twice that's another thing write it down okay if you're listening to just write it down always call twice anybody are calling curiosity is a people want to know what you're talking about and some most of the times when people ignore it's not because they're not there but it's because they just sometimes ignore it okay because they're talking to somebody they don't think it's that important so call twice call twice he picks up on the other end and I'm like hey so the $50 an hour rate is actually my coaching rate and my tutoring rate but my consulting rate to work with the client is actually $100 an hour and then on the other end it was kind of just like this what you feel right now just and literally look my hands were kind of shaking and I just heard nothing from the other end and I'm sitting there I'm like oh oh like what's going on I'm like really scared at this point and then he responds and he says okay sounds good let us get back to you on this hung up and then I didn't hear for full 24 hours later and so at this point I'm freaking out but I'm trying to keep calm just going about my day and I'm like this doesn't happen that's okay learning experience okay this is like a reference so I'll learn it and I'll keep this in my mental note and move on from there as I have to learn how to negotiate if I can negotiate literally if I'm going from fifty to hundred dollars an hour don't just think of it as one job going from 50 to 100 an hour what this means it is I'm saving half of my life for fifty dollars an hour let's just say in a year I'm just throwing out round numbers that like just to simplify it but let's say you make fifty thousand dollars in one year but if you can just get on one uncomfortable phone call and make hundred dollars an hour and let's say now at the end of the year somehow you're making 100k a year you've doubled your time the same amount you've doubled the money you make and the same amount of time the work that would take you two years now takes you one year the work that would take you ten years now takes you five years all right so not only is this gonna be giving you the lifestyle that you want okay not only is it going to be adding that side income that you want or whatever this is also gonna be helping you spend time with your friends and family that you love okay so keep in mind why more money is important okay it's not just we're gonna be sitting on this pile of cash okay the main goal is that you go out you have fun you buy your friend bunch of things you buy gifts for your mom your girlfriend whoever without having to have that guilt of like I really need to check my bank account but I shouldn't write that guilt but instead in this case you're more like I'm not gonna check my bank account because I don't have to okay I know I'm good so that peace of mind is really the most important thing so anyways they got back to me 24 hours later and I just see this long text from my preview of the phone so I'm like walking in coming back again from Oakland Community College and in in this time between in this 24 hours I've gotten so much heat from my family I've gotten so much heat from my friends and they're just like you don't deserve this you just looked a gift horse in the mouth you had this amazing opportunity and you just ruined it you always want more all this crazy nonsense okay got home saw this big preview kinda had a feeling what was going on but wasn't sure and then ultimately realize who I'm talking is YouTube so I'm on Instagram Facebook there and I'm talking to YouTube right now and I see this message I go through it and basically long story short the message was pretty much congratulations all right those congratulations you got it okay and I remember reading that I just like literally skim through all the text didn't even read what the text was about just read the part that said like congratulations we'll start this Wednesday I'm like oh oh my god what the hell just happened like what just happened I literally half to my life like half the lifetime of work that I need to do negotiated something absolutely insane sat through this I just couldn't believe it and I didn't tell anybody for a while for that day for a few hours people were just like why are you sitting like this why are you so shocked why do you look traumatized cause II like I would just go I hung out with my friends and I was just shocked or lookin at them not even speaking and now finally you know I let the cat out of the bag or cat out of the hat I don't know what the expression is but um I told them that this was the case and every single person who had told me don't do it and had given me for it was just kind of looking at me incredibly shocked but I'm not the person to tell you I told you so or whatever I don't even make a few people feel guilty so I'm just like yeah I got it you know just like you said I would and they're like yeah yeah you know I believed in you yeah of course like we knew you could do it I mean don't you think we knew you could do it and then they're like yeah of course we knew but even though that didn't say that at all when I was going through that and Nick was like of course why wouldn't they pay you hundred dollars an hour he's like of course so unbelievable situation for me okay again remember where I'm coming from for those of you who are just tuning in you know Oakland Community College student 2.5 GPA 19 a CT out of 36 19 is so bad you're borderline really dumb okay and now I'm learning Python development I find that I'm actually good at something even though I wasn't good at math I spent a lot of time figuring out coding and I'm like I'm good at this and then getting paid what I deserve maybe at that time maybe even slightly more than a dessert but I don't know cuz now that I look back at it how hard I work and how diligently I worked and how much value I provided around the clock without thinking even about time I think I deserved that Pape and another thing I want you guys note down is think about what having a mentor can do for you okay so having that mentor versus everybody else literally changed my life increased me two times the speed of what my life would normally go at okay with just one word that he told me and also how he taught me software development so if you don't have a mentor in your life you know look around and see if you can find one okay try to find one you don't always have to pay them but if you even go to meetup groups and even go to local events and just hang around likeminded people you can be learning a lot a lot a lot from them so make sure that you write all of this stuff down okay cool how was that did you guys like hearing that was that valuable for you guys valuable let me know huh exactly part says here I am with a 3.5 GPA going to college worried who else feels like that you know who else feels like they're busting their ass at school or whatever it is you know maybe a job but just either aren't getting paid what you deserve right or you feel like you need years of experience and you just need to spend five to ten years and you need to at least have a point port 4.0 GPA you need to at least go to Harvard before you even start thinking about getting paid what you deserve yeah I mean if for me it was like one of the most powerful lessons of my entire life of my entire life and you know that's really the main one of the main things I wanted to share with you and how that just changes everything and then when I was making this much money and imagine imagine like I'm again at this time I don't really have any time because I'm going fulltime to college I was also coaching students for chess and coding and then I'm also doing this big freelancing thing okay now imagine I am young I'm doing all these other things that I'm doing only have a few hours to work on coding on building software and it's so much fun that I would pay to do it here I was getting paid to do it add age of 20 or 21 I get to travel and I'm going to places like when it was my nephew's birthday and it was actually like literally birthday like as in my nephew was born all right he's adorable he's like two now he's gonna be to actually November 23rd and I'm gonna fly out again right when he was born I got to fly out I didn't have to rely on my family I'd have to rely on my friends as a 21 year old you got to leave just fly out pay for my own self not have my brother or family to pay for me not have my friends pay for me and go visit my brother see my little nephew okay at the hospital and that was just an unbelievable experience I have photos of everything and I'll show you guys where it's a lot easier because right now it's hard for me to excrete share or whatever but uh literally you know got to play with them and as I was doing that I would just be sneaking in some work I'm sitting at the hospital okay and while the nurses are talking or whatever and everybody else is busy I'm literally sitting in the waiting room and talking with my family I have my laptop open I have my feet kicked up on the table and I'm getting to work on something that's so fun and mentally stimulating and I'm getting paid for it I put in two hours right before getting into the room boom like 200 bucks okay and again at that time that was so much to me and as a college student you can imagine that that's a lot and I could work from the hospital I could go and be at an amazing place like we were at so Golden Gate Bridge and we parked our car and we walked out and we're talking having a good time we spent many hours there and then I would sneak in just a few times here and there and just code and work on the project because I don't have to actually be there to be working on this and then BOOM put my computer away while traveling and having the time of my life and even the work that I was doing was so fun that sometimes my family and my friends would have to actually stop me from saying and from doing coding all the time from building things all the time and all this right and I got paid twenty thousand dollars in one month okay to be specific I think it was something like 20 or $21,000 and seven or twentyone thousand seven or sixtyfive dollars yeah something whatever twenty one seven three whatever but it was like a very specific number and I remembered it I forgot now but you know imagine one month and college student you have your state doing all these other things like you don't have time you're not smart you don't feel like you're good enough and then you can really be making a difference in the world providing value I was saving this company hundreds of hours of their time by the way and all this code I was writing was something I had learned in like three months so clearly I'm not a very good coder at this point because you need to really be spending a lot more time to be learning this stuff and it's still possible to putting these things together and this is when I was realizing like you can have an amazing life solid me traveling can be making money can be getting paid what you deserve but the big thing I started realizing was I have so many of so many people who are either graduating college or people who are 40 or 50 years old and either one they're just making excuses about their age or that they're not smart enough or the other people are graduate with colic from college accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars of loans and then when they go to the job market whether they're young or old whether they've gone to college or not gone to college you know when they they don't have the actual skills nobody ever taught them the actual skills to land a job nobody ever taught them how to negotiate with a client nobody how to nobody taught them how to build that relationship and these fundamental skills were just missing from college for missing from the world of academia are not taught online anywhere I couldn't find this on udemy Coursera Udacity EDX and I've gone through so many of those courses literally thousands of dollars worth of courses and that's where I you know I learned from because I didn't have any better resources so just think about how many wrong things are taught and like popularized and like you have to be good at math to become a programmer and you have to be this go to this college to become a programmer and you have to have this and that it's just you know those were the things that caused me so much pain and I was like I want to build this channel literally for my younger self if there's somebody who is out there that could use this help you know and it could help them I don't care whether they're 60 years old or 10 years old this could help them that's all I needed and I wanted to show people like there's a there's a route of just theory and experience and that traditional route like you go to college you go to high school you go to college you graduate you get a job you get another job and then what happens you die okay there's that route and then there's another route where you can be very practical learn negotiation skills learn how to be likable not to work with the team and then 10 or 15% of your skills are made up of coding okay and then you're getting paid more you're landing jobs you're not accumulating loans so just think of it like the practical guy and the theoretical guy the fury guy so if you're not watching this right now write this down do you want to be the fury I or do you want to be the practical guy and if there are girls in here do you want to be the fury girl or the practical girl okay do you want to just learn all this weird esoteric stuff or do you want to figure out how can you give value to the client you're working with and how can you help them solve a problem save them time and save them money I was saving them fifty to hundred thousand dollars a year okay because of how many hours my software was saving them so was it easy for them to pay me fifty to twenty thousand dollars yes okay and I identified how much money I would be saving them and I told them I'd be saving them this much money and when I sent them the proposal and I said I'm gonna be saving you 50 to $100,000 and I think I should be paid a hundred dollars an hour to work on this and over the next that next month I had an invoice of twenty thousand dollars okay so also know what budget your client is working with okay like Bo where if you're working with the client who's building that next face book but he also he only wants to hire you as a you know freebie intern guy he has no budget and then you try to you start working with him and you spend all this time and then later you're like but put what am I gonna start getting paid I'm overworked and underpaid there's no money there he doesn't have money she doesn't have money okay they hired you on some weird promise and there's nothing there I work with a company that I knew had a budget I knew exactly what their budget was I knew exactly how much money I'd be making them and I knew exactly where my money that they're gonna be paying me is coming from so you see that's why the business skills are really important and if you miss out on them you're just gonna spend so many more years getting what you want because let's be realistic we want coding skills you want to be good programmers but I mean come on do we really really just want to do it to become a good programmer we want to do it so we can do something we love we want to do it so we can make an impact in the world solve people's problems okay and we want to do it so we can get paid what we deserve not only can we take care of ourselves but we can take care of those around us that we care for right damn cool so now what I want to tell you guys about is we're 54 minutes in and before we end this in you know I want to end this at one hour I want to give you guys something very special ok this is something I was saving for you guys and I'm gonna put this up right now but here's what I'm gonna be giving you guys ok I have a free master class coming up ok and I want you to get on this free master class is called your

you the directions on how you can get it go alright what are we getting yes cool we're getting a lot of yeses so here's what we need to do Facebook there's a link in the description there's a link in the description okay you can click on this link put in your email done okay done that's it Instagram bio okay go to the bio on Instagram YouTube link in the description okay it says get my new free profitable programmer masterclass alright mmm right here none of this shows on you Instagram and Facebook so they think we're crazy but there's actually a graphic I have on YouTube and my beautiful course is supposed to be showing up here so don't think I'm crazy alright maybe I am a little bit so here it is this beautiful course okay it's coming up it's gonna blow your mind go sign up for the VIP waitlist okay for my flagship Python course it's called create apps and land your first client with Python in less than 90 days I'm gonna be showing you how to profit with Python I'm gonna be showing you how you can put money into your pocket with Python not just another course of let's learn some technical skills and today we're gonna learn about objects and object oriented programming and let's instantiate a class but whoa whoa whoa let's not talk about how you can actually do something practical with it how you can actually provide value to people and how you could actually make a living off of it so you could share that with your friends your family and not feel like you're stupid okay not none of those classes exist okay so that's why I want to put this together for you so again highly practical I wanted to put this together for people who are not only you know yes there are people who don't have a job right now we're doing nothing and have hundreds of hours great you can put that in get the results faster but I wanted to make this for people who are also busy doing jobs have to spend time with family maybe have a family maybe have kids okay maybe our older okay yeah I don't even care 460 or seven years old I wanted to put this together for somebody who has all these other obligations has limited time maybe even two to three hours a week okay and so I want to make sure that you're getting everything that you need even if you're spending as little as two to three hours a week okay again you're gonna find out a lot more about this for now click that link and sign up for the free master class your profitable programmer master class okay and this we're gonna go through everything so the instagrams the stream has ended this course we're gonna be talking about web apps I'm not gonna go into what this course is about yet okay not gonna be doing it again take that free master class and you're gonna get just tremendous amount of value and everything in that master class is something you could take and apply right now if you're a guitar instructor or a shark hunter or I don't care what it is that you do right now everything that I always try to give in my videos is something you could take and apply even if you never become a Python developer okay again my goal is to help you become that Python developer but I want to give you value so you can apply this right off the bat okay awesome link is in the description so anybody who's asking me on facebook links in the description if you're on youtube link is in the description the link is called data the first client with python go to that link put in your email done there's no age restriction so to sign up for it there's no age restriction if you're young you can sign up for it if you're all you can sign up for it okay again if you have listened to my story today you know that those are just limiting beliefs okay that's like self sabotaging yourself if you listen to my story you've learned that I believed in myself even though I didn't have those skills at that point and I believed in myself even when my whole family and all my friends were against what I was doing which was negotiating a higher Gallery or doing work outside of just school or you know learning how I was learning okay so again don't take that traditional path because that only tells you you have to spend six years learning you have to spend the next ten years getting experience and then you can maybe charge $30 an hour believe it or not there are a lot of like just look online okay go to places like upward comm code mentor and just look at how many talented talented programmers there are 30 40 years of experience I'm talking okay there are legendary programmers way better than I'll ever be okay again and I'm not an expert and these guys are charging 20 to 30 bucks an hour and I don't think I'm not saying that that's a little money I'm just saying that that's not what they deserve they deserve a lot more so why just miss out on it and why not be able to have the lifestyle you want and why not be able to provide that lifestyle to the people around you why not why not alright so this stuff people are saying it's mindblowing they're loving it people are excited let me just go read and what's going on on YouTube see what's going on people are sending me their phone numbers I mean what the hell is going on people are making groups what is happening on YouTube oh maybe well one day well we'll do is livestream and then make a group for everybody and then like add everybody in that group that would be cool I'm just looking at some questions to sign up for the free master class guys it's absolutely free to sign up to get on the VIP waitlist for the course absolutely free so yes to answer you guys questions it's free when you go click on that link and you get my free master class again this stuff is absolutely mindblowing eyeopening and it will reveal secrets to you that are just not known to even professional software developers with 50 30 40 years of experience ok so again this is not a master class you want to sleep on this is not what you want to miss and how Python is trending right now you want to jump on this wave right this second and you'll make them most amount of profit and it's a lucrative field okay if you don't take any action you'll stay exactly where you are okay if you take action Bitcoin what happened for example for those of you don't know it's a crypto currency was $300 there were people that were sleeping on Bitcoin okay now it's at six thousand dollars so think about what not taking action causes you and there's so many people are like I was gonna buy it I didn't well sucks to suck right like I don't know what else to say there so just remember take action when you think you like something or you have that instinct trust your instincts take action so again if please if you came to this live stream you want to improve your life you don't want to procrastinate you don't want to linger right you want to make the lives of other people better you want to have a job which you love waking up to not because you work not because you have to but because you want to you want to have that lifestyle where you can travel you want to be able to have that mutual respect with your clients where you can not only hire them but also fire them okay and you guys are working together and they're also paying you at the same time while giving you respect I mean did we talk about respect I mean there's so many jobs where when they work doing they pay you they don't treat you the right way but imagine having your own clients where these guys respect you you know or even if you want to go to fulltime route I can show you how to position yourself in a way where you're that trusted adviser and you stand out from everybody else and these people respect you okay instead of oh we're paying him so we're paying him or her and we can treat hurt him or her however we want okay so think about those things all right sign up for that free masterclass links below I'm wrapping it up I'm gonna just answer maybe some questions or see
