With timestamps:

00:00 - we're going to be watching a clip from
00:01 - the head of AWS and how he thinks the
00:05 - future of programming will be natural
00:08 - language so let's go listen from the man
00:13 - himself the programming language of the
00:16 - next decade is not going to be the
00:18 - traditional way that we've been writing
00:20 - code it's just going to be natural
00:22 - language you're just going to describe
00:24 - what it is that you want the system to
00:25 - do and it will interpret it
00:27 - automatically and that's an incredibly
00:29 - democratizing an incredibly exciting
00:31 - opportunity to reinvent every product
00:33 - and process incredibly scary for most
00:36 - developers because I know it freaks them
00:38 - out which is why I get hate comments on
00:41 - this topic all the time but I don't give
00:43 - a because I don't it doesn't matter
00:45 - to me what matters to me is the truth
00:46 - and what's going to be happening moving
00:48 - forward so it's a very scary time for
00:51 - people who are set in their ways have
00:54 - been Developers for decades and are now
00:57 - basically going to get dethroned because
00:59 - somebody else can can do their job but
01:01 - for people who are excited about this
01:04 - opportunity I'm a developer I'm excited
01:06 - cuz I'm like oh oh my God I can build 10
01:08 - times faster that is absolutely
01:09 - incredible and people who are 99% of the
01:12 - people who don't know how to code in the
01:13 - world 99.9% of the world doesn't know
01:15 - how to code that part of the world can
01:17 - now come in and build things so if
01:19 - you're a nurse and you've been wanting
01:20 - to switch into programming this is the
01:23 - best time if you're a truck driver you
01:27 - drive Uber or you're you do whatever
01:29 - right you you do you instacart for
01:31 - people uh you Uber Eats for people you
01:34 - are it tech support
01:36 - you're a product manager you're you're a
01:39 - UI U ux
01:41 - designer if you're any of these people
01:44 - this is the most fascinating and
01:45 - interesting time to get into programming
01:47 - because you can write natural language
01:49 - meaning English or language of your
01:51 - choice and you can build things fast
01:54 - let's keep
01:56 - going cool so watch out mandix local
01:59 - platform form supercharged with AWS Ai
02:03 - and China AI awesome Matt thank you so
02:05 - much thank you very much thank
02:07 - [Applause]
02:11 - you mendex AI that sounds interesting
02:14 - let's take a look okay mendex dcom
02:19 - platform build AI augmented Solutions
02:22 - with AI assisted development so this is
02:26 - a
02:27 - enterprise software
02:30 - they're saying they're going to release
02:31 - it to the whole world so we'll see H try
02:33 - mendex for free
02:37 - interesting so we'll try this as well in
02:40 - a
02:41 - second but let's keep
02:43 - going harness low code and AI to elevate
02:46 - efficiency bu application smarter build
02:49 - smarter
02:51 - applications
02:53 - interesting okay AI assisted application
02:55 - modeling and
02:58 - logic ah show ser once and then do
03:01 - something okay so workflow it's almost
03:02 - like how some of these tools are like
03:04 - bot press where you
03:06 - can build a workflow in your Bot with
03:09 - kind of a point uh point and click UI
03:13 - interface that's nice I think it's going
03:15 - to make coding a lot faster because yeah
03:17 - when I'm coding on like low code
03:18 - platforms they make this so much faster
03:20 - for you A lot of these things so much
03:23 - faster AI automated validation logic
03:27 - okay validation Bots tap into pre
03:29 - configured Expressions to automate the
03:31 - otherwise manual and repetitive
03:33 - repetitive task of setting up data
03:35 - validations interesting that's great
03:37 - generate validation
03:38 - microflow okay now the only thing is is
03:41 - like AWS so I'm not that excited about
03:43 - it honestly because AWS I just hate
03:45 - their platform and everything just feels
03:48 - so like the The Experience just feels
03:52 - filled with
03:54 - friction when you're trying to build
03:56 - something AWS at least that's been my
03:58 - experience I just avoid it to me it
04:00 - feels like a night nightmare like if I'm
04:01 - trying to do something I got to set up
04:03 - like a server then I got to know like if
04:05 - it's going to be in the Ohio region or
04:07 - where am I going to put it and then I
04:09 - got to start coding it up so whenever
04:11 - I'm trying to come up with a new idea of
04:12 - something that's is the last place AWS
04:14 - is the last place I will ever go just
04:16 - because they give you too much control
04:17 - and I don't want that I just want to
04:19 - like write code and build stuff and so
04:21 - personally I will go with um fire
04:25 - Firebase or super base or anything that
04:28 - makes my life a lot easier to get
04:30 - started with and uh you know Google
04:33 - Cloud also is to me feels way easier
04:37 - achieve AI driven operational excellence
04:40 - okay so what's happening here mendex is
04:43 - the only low code platform I like that
04:45 - they're making it low code I like the
04:47 - direction they're moving with the
04:48 - versatility to facilitate AI ml
04:50 - integration with both external cognitive
04:52 - services and embedded ml models
04:56 - okay cognitive Services what do they
04:59 - mean by this
05:00 - easily connects to any third party
05:02 - services to interact with models okay oh
05:05 - nice Okay cool so seamlessly integrate
05:07 - with chat GPT Google bard and Amazon
05:09 - Bedrock which I've never heard of what
05:11 - the heck is Amazon Bedrock let's check
05:12 - it
05:14 - out
05:17 - interesting the easiest way to build and
05:19 - scale a generative a applications
05:21 - Foundation models uhuh
05:26 - [Music]
05:28 - interesting
05:30 - [Music]
05:34 - generative AI is delivering entirely new
05:37 - experiences and driving ler levels of
05:40 - prod I hate these corporate
05:42 - videos man oh my God productivity
05:44 - unlocking more potential for Innovation
05:47 - transformation efficiency and
05:49 - productivity than we have seen since the
05:51 - earliest days of the internet
05:52 - organizations of all sizes are already
05:55 - building with generative Ai and seeing
05:57 - the excitement of shit's so cringey way
06:01 - to build and scale generative AI
06:03 - applications Amazon Bedrock is a fully
06:06 - managed service that offers leading
06:08 - Foundation models along with a broad
06:11 - just show me how it
06:14 - works
06:17 - holy
06:20 - okay so they're clearly not going to
06:22 - show us anything right choice of models
06:25 - okay Amazon Titan that seems
06:28 - interesting
06:30 - okay so it does something we don't know
06:32 - what the it does because they just
06:33 - won't show it to us and uh yeah but it
06:37 - clearly does some type of generative AI
06:40 - probably similar topt and Google bard
06:42 - okay or use additional AI services from
06:45 - okay
06:46 - awesome so yeah so basically CH GPT
06:49 - would become like this integrated thing
06:52 - into AWS which is
06:54 - cool all right great so this is what
06:58 - mendex is and that's the the future of
07:00 - you know of what they're talking about
07:02 - but overall I think I just wanted to
07:05 - share that clip with you guys right
07:06 - where it's about natural language where
07:09 - programming is heading to where you're
07:11 - writing in English or you're writing in
07:14 - Spanish whatever your tongue is and then
07:17 - it's doing all the magic and building
07:19 - out the application for you and so this
07:23 - is where I believe the future is headed
07:25 - this is
07:26 - where I believe all of PR programming is
07:29 - going to be headed and whether that
07:31 - happens in the next year or 5 years or
07:33 - 10 years it will be happening and so if
07:35 - you want to be a part of the future and
07:36 - you want to do this and you want to be
07:38 - able to make an income from doing this
07:40 - and you want to be somebody who is
07:41 - irreplaceable then what I recommend is
07:44 - check out a free training that I've put
07:46 - together on this and that free training
07:49 - covers how do you use chat GPT and AI to
07:52 - build these
07:54 - apps and how do you build apps quickly
07:57 - okay and in that free training that I've
08:00 - put together for you I also give you
08:01 - three SAS ideas that you can use and
08:05 - build right after you're done watching
08:07 - that video to actually monetize and even
08:09 - make money with coding and AI so if that
08:12 - sounds interesting or exciting click the
08:14 - link below and watch that free training
08:17 - and I'll see you inside peace
