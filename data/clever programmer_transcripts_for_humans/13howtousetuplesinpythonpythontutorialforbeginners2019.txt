00:00 - hey what's up you guys aaron here from
00:03 - clever programmer today and today we are
00:06 - just going to be talking about tuples in
00:08 - python you don't know what that is yet
00:10 - but you're about to find out let's get
00:11 - started alright so a tuple is a first of
00:22 - all it's a weird word I don't know what
00:23 - the heck it means but that's how you
00:25 - spell it tu piel e and I'm all a tuple
00:28 - really is it's a list with constraints
00:32 - so I'm in a previous video I think we
00:36 - all went over lists so a list a list
00:39 - just looks like like this write with
00:42 - brackets you have something like that
00:44 - all a tuple is gonna be is gonna be the
00:47 - exact same thing but with parentheses
00:49 - okay like that so now L is actually a
00:52 - tuple so I'm gonna change this to a t so
00:54 - a tuple is just it looks like just like
00:56 - a list but it has parentheses instead of
00:58 - brackets um that's not the only thing
01:03 - that differentiates them um that's just
01:05 - what it looks like on on the screen when
01:07 - you're coding that's what a tuple will
01:08 - look like but the difference is list
01:13 - could could have anything in there and
01:15 - so can a tuple they are similar in that
01:17 - sense you can index into them using that
01:19 - bracket notation so let me just show you
01:21 - that real quick actually print T at 0 as
01:27 - you can see the 1 prints out cuz that's
01:28 - the first one so you can do that just
01:30 - like a list you can read from it but
01:34 - that's pretty much it
01:35 - the thing the thing about tuples is you
01:37 - can't actually change it you can't you
01:42 - can't add elements to it you can't
01:44 - remove elements to it and I think that's
01:48 - about it you can't add and you can't
01:49 - remove and you can't change things
01:52 - within it if they're immutable if they
01:54 - are also unchangeable so that's that's
01:58 - kind of a little bit a little bit weird
02:00 - to to explain but basically you can't
02:03 - add or change you can't add or remove
02:04 - elements to it it's a very it's a very
02:07 - stable structured kind of data type so
02:11 - you can overwrite the entire thing
02:13 - so if I had tea here and then I and I
02:15 - overrode tea by setting equal to five
02:17 - then yes its entire tube will be deleted
02:19 - but I'm not actually changing things to
02:21 - it so what is this good for you might be
02:23 - asking okay so what's the point of
02:24 - having a to pool if I can just use a
02:26 - list well there are some times you want
02:29 - to be more secure with your data so
02:31 - let's say you had a a credit card okay
02:35 - credit card I just call it credit card
02:38 - like that and you have multiple things
02:40 - on a credit card so this is what I was
02:42 - talking about structured data so a
02:43 - credit card has a credit card number
02:48 - right so let's put that in first I think
02:51 - it's like 16 digits I'll just put want
02:53 - it before like that a bunch you'd have
02:55 - your the credit card number you might
02:58 - have a name on there so let's just say
03:00 - first name or oh no oh let's put a Joe
03:06 - Rogan's because why not and then you
03:08 - would have an expiration date which
03:10 - could be like December 31st 2019 or
03:15 - something like that or on credit cards I
03:16 - think it's just like 11/19 or 20 there
03:23 - we go November November of 2020 and then
03:26 - on a security code usually have like a
03:28 - three digit or four digit security code
03:30 - that you also need in addition to the
03:32 - number right let's just put it in like
03:34 - that so you have a credit card here as a
03:36 - tuple the reason we would have used and
03:38 - it used a tuple here is because every
03:40 - element of the tuple has a consistent
03:43 - meaning okay so none that none of this
03:46 - can be changed I cannot go in and change
03:48 - this number I cannot go in here and
03:49 - change this I cannot go in here and
03:50 - change this but it's all together as a
03:56 - whole them together so it usually you'd
04:01 - be using it for things like this um one
04:03 - thing that is that it's very useful for
04:05 - is actually having a list of tuples
04:07 - so let's you let's say you had multiple
04:08 - credit cards then you could create a
04:10 - second credit card let's just create a
04:12 - second one like this okay and then let's
04:17 - just change or whatever screw it we can
04:20 - just leave it like that so credit card
04:22 - one and credit card two
04:24 - and then let's just say we wanted to
04:27 - have a list credit cards with an S and
04:31 - then you could just create a list with
04:34 - credit card one and credit card to okay
04:38 - and then we could print out all of our
04:41 - credit cards just like that so you got
04:44 - are you guys following well we created
04:46 - two tuples here two separate tuples
04:48 - using the parentheses and then we stuck
04:52 - them in a list and we're gonna print it
04:53 - out so this is handy because let's run
04:56 - this again so it looks nicer this is
04:57 - handy because as you can see we have a
05:00 - bunch of credit cards here that are um
05:02 - structured there it's a structured kind
05:04 - of idea and then you can just put a
05:06 - bunch of these together so you can
05:07 - actually change this list this
05:08 - overarching this wrapping list on the
05:10 - outside you can always add more credit
05:11 - cards to it because it's a list but
05:13 - within each of these little credit card
05:15 - tuples you can't actually change or add
05:17 - anything to it because we don't want it
05:18 - to it's a very stable structuring kind
05:21 - of data type alright so that's pretty
05:23 - much tuples one thing one cool thing I
05:26 - wanna mention about tuples is because
05:28 - they're so structured you can actually
05:29 - do this cool thing called unpacking a
05:31 - tuple okay so let's get rid of these
05:37 - here let's just get rid of everything
05:40 - let's say we have a person okay a
05:43 - variable called person and we're gonna
05:46 - make it a tuple and we'll say that every
05:48 - person has a name right we're not gonna
05:50 - call a name we're gonna call it Nancy
05:52 - okay Nancy pants cuz I like that
05:55 - Nancy pants and then uhm age let's put
06:01 - 25 okay so Nancy Pat's is 25 years old
06:04 - and uh let's also put favorite food okay
06:11 - pizza like that so we have a person here
06:14 - okay as a tuple and because the tuple is
06:17 - structured a cool thing we can actually
06:19 - do in Python is actually just go like
06:22 - this we can create three new variables
06:24 - so name comma age comma fav food
06:30 - favorite food okay we're gonna put this
06:34 - here like this and then we can actually
06:36 - say this is equal to
06:38 - person so what's happening here is we
06:42 - are unpacking this tuple or are we we're
06:44 - unpacking this person tuple so this
06:46 - person tuple has three aspects to it has
06:49 - a name it has an age and it has a
06:50 - favorite food so that's what we're what
06:52 - we're specifying here we're specifying
06:54 - three new variables called name age and
06:56 - favorite food and then we're setting it
06:58 - equal to this tuple the cool thing that
07:00 - happens here though is now I can
07:01 - actually print out each of these things
07:04 - individually completely individually so
07:09 - pretty sure you guys see where I'm going
07:11 - here now we have these three variables
07:14 - separately so instead of going like okay
07:17 - person at 0 and person at one person at
07:21 - 2 etc we can actually just unpack it
07:23 - this way and use more descriptive names
07:25 - instead of person at 0 and person at 1
07:27 - and whatever so when I run this as you
07:30 - can see all three pop out because we
07:32 - unpacked this tuple one other cool thing
07:34 - is you actually don't even need these
07:36 - parentheses here it's something really
07:37 - cool you can do so you can say okay name
07:39 - name age and fat food you're actually
07:42 - setting three variables completely in
07:45 - one line you're setting it equal to this
07:47 - tuple which is going to correspond in
07:49 - order because the tuple is ordered just
07:51 - like a list but it's structured so that
07:53 - you can actually unpack it this way very
07:56 - very useful thing especially if you are
07:58 - iterating over a bunch of tuples okay
08:00 - let's say you have like I said you could
08:02 - iterate over a list you can also edit
08:04 - over a a list of tuples and then in each
08:08 - iteration you actually unpack the V
08:12 - tuple in the loop itself so let's let's
08:14 - see what that would look like so let's
08:16 - say for name age five food in um oh this
08:24 - would have to be a list let's just
08:27 - create two people so you can see how
08:28 - this works very useful thing with tuples
08:31 - called tuple unpacking Nancy
08:37 - Joe shirt I was not as funny but
08:41 - whatever age 20 and favorite food is
08:43 - pasta
08:44 - okay so we have person 1 and person 2
08:47 - and then we are just going to create a
08:50 - people list equals person 1 and person 2
08:57 - oh I I could have just stuck these
08:59 - tuples directly in here but it's just
09:01 - better to use variables like this and
09:03 - I'm putting the variables here it's more
09:04 - clear okay I'm just creating a list here
09:08 - of a list of two people and each person
09:11 - is a tuple so now we can say okay let's
09:13 - iterate over people and since we are
09:16 - unpacking this it's going to iterate
09:19 - this this loop is going to iterate over
09:20 - this entire list and each time it goes
09:23 - through it's actually going to unpack
09:24 - these tuples so that in the iteration I
09:26 - can actually print out everything in
09:31 - here so I can put just like print name
09:33 - actually issues the same is here let me
09:35 - just copy and paste this boom-boom-boom
09:40 - yup just like that so what and then
09:42 - we'll put a space an empty an empty
09:44 - print statement we'll just print nothing
09:46 - okay so we have everything here for two
09:49 - iterations and when we run this what is
09:55 - wrong in people person is not defined oh
10:01 - okay well let's just get rid of this we
10:04 - don't need this here and yeah screw rid
10:09 - of all this oops
10:13 - yeah because that was giving us a
10:15 - problem because I changed this up from
10:16 - person to person one this is I wasn't
10:18 - working anymore so let's hit run and as
10:20 - you can see this loop ran twice and it
10:23 - unpacked both of these tuples okay so
10:25 - you can hold you can hold data structure
10:28 - data and tuples and then you have very
10:30 - easy structured access to them via
10:32 - unpacking so a very useful thing in
10:34 - Python I like using them a lot
10:37 - especially in loops like this down here
10:39 - in the for loop ah but that's pretty
10:42 - much it for this um this video guys
10:44 - thank you very much for watching and
10:45 - I'll see you guys next time
10:47 - [Music]

this what is wrong in people person is not defined oh okay well let's just get rid of this we don't need this here and yeah screw rid of all this oops yeah because that was giving us a problem because I changed this up from person to person one this is I wasn't working anymore so let's hit run and as you can see this loop ran twice and it unpacked both of these tuples okay so you can hold you can

in the for loop ah but that's pretty much it for this um this video guys thank you very much for watching and I'll see you guys next time
