00:00 - talking about how to build a youtube
00:02 - thumbnail app
00:03 - in react.js now if you guys aren't sure
00:06 - what we mean here
00:07 - let me give you a quick rundown of what
00:08 - we're going to be doing today so
00:10 - on youtube you have all of these nice
00:12 - beautiful thumbnails that pop up every
00:13 - time you go over there right
00:15 - we needed an internal tool inside of
00:18 - um in inside the clever programmer team
00:21 - where we could basically
00:22 - go in and add our thumbnail to see what
00:25 - it looks like so that way
00:26 - we can see if you guys are click are
00:27 - going to click it or not and it helps us
00:29 - you know
00:30 - get the video out to more people so what
00:32 - we thought is right
00:33 - i had to build this as a side project
00:35 - right so i thought hang on hang on every
00:38 - single app that i've released
00:39 - out there and every single app that i
00:40 - put out there what i've ended up doing
00:42 - is i prepare it beforehand
00:44 - and then we pretty much go ahead and
00:47 - show you guys and demonstrate everything
00:48 - on a live stream right but today
00:51 - something something it's going to be
00:52 - very cool guys
00:53 - today i have not prepared anything so
00:56 - this is a entire sort of uh
00:59 - stream where pretty much you guys can
01:01 - code alongside me
01:03 - and we can go ahead and build this thing
01:06 - together so
01:06 - who is pumped let me know in the
01:08 - comments guys i can see a few people
01:10 - coming in this is awesome
01:12 - i see iosh i see i am one z pidgin
01:14 - what's up guys
01:16 - cena sure at z of z bridge and nice
01:18 - decide to come in now christian maher
01:20 - warden what's up guys good to see you
01:23 - all again
01:24 - if you guys are pumped and you guys are
01:26 - ready for this let's
01:27 - drop some fire in the comments and let's
01:29 - get everyone warmed up
01:30 - so we can um get started soon guys
01:33 - just to reassure you guys um for you who
01:36 - are new
01:37 - and who are joining in we are going to
01:39 - be building a
01:40 - react thumbnail app so essentially it's
01:43 - going to be a case of so what do we want
01:45 - to build today guys
01:46 - we basically want to have like a sort of
01:48 - lightweight react clone right but i
01:50 - would basically want to have it so that
01:52 - i can go ahead and add a thumbnail over
01:55 - here
01:56 - so right now we have garyvee's thumbnail
01:58 - i can go ahead and add a thumbnail so
01:59 - that way we can see
02:00 - how it looks inside of the app and we
02:03 - can basically test
02:04 - what different thumbnails look like
02:06 - before we actually put a video live
02:08 - so and guys if you guys find this super
02:10 - exciting and you guys find this useful
02:12 - we actually might go ahead and drop a
02:14 - full youtube clone so if that's
02:16 - something that you guys are interested
02:17 - in
02:18 - please let me know and we can go ahead
02:20 - and do that
02:21 - i see a few people in the comments right
02:23 - now so we have karen
02:24 - teodoro let's go ahead and let's get
02:26 - let's go and read some of your comments

02:52 - actually let me go ahead oh we got some
02:54 - comments firing in
02:55 - so will you send us the download link
02:57 - guys actually you know what let's let's
02:59 - do that as well you know once we build
03:00 - this app let's go ahead and deploy it
03:02 - and then that way you guys can go ahead
03:03 - and check it out and play with the app
03:05 - and stuff like that
03:06 - right that'll be fun i think that'll be
03:07 - pretty fun we can go ahead and see how
03:09 - it goes
03:10 - we have let's see our pete singh says he
03:13 - cannot wait
03:14 - awesome dude i like your enthusiasm guys
03:16 - if you're excited right
03:17 - now and you guys like these tutorials
03:20 - smash the thumbs up button because this
03:22 - helps it get out to more people
03:23 - and you know like we want we want as
03:25 - many people to see this stuff as we
03:26 - possibly can
03:28 - right now for you guys who have coded in
03:30 - react before
03:31 - let's go ahead and drop some fire in the
03:33 - comments because i love to see who's
03:35 - coding him react before
03:36 - and um panjie gautam says please build a
03:40 - youtube channel awesome okay
03:42 - milland says uh lovely sunny it's fun to
03:45 - make this type of project
03:46 - exactly dude that's exactly so let me go
03:49 - ahead and pin that one here
03:50 - yeah you know what i do like this kind
03:51 - of stuff guys this is like a side
03:53 - project right like
03:54 - we can code for like big stuff we can go
03:56 - for it for like
03:57 - you know production sort of level apps
03:59 - but sometimes
04:01 - we just need apps that help us out
04:03 - sometimes we just need
04:05 - to use react and have a bit of fun with
04:07 - react you know so we can basically build
04:08 - stuff
04:09 - that will basically make our life a
04:10 - little bit easier you know
04:12 - so today again guys what are we going to
04:14 - be doing we are going to be building a
04:16 - react thumbnail tester okay so this is
04:19 - essentially going to be
04:20 - we're not this is not an app to create a
04:22 - thumbnail this is basically going to be
04:24 - we're going to build a react app which
04:25 - looks pretty similar to this
04:26 - it's going to be responsive and the aim
04:28 - of this app is to test
04:30 - thumbnails out so so that way we can see
04:32 - what our thumbnail looks like here
04:34 - so whatever and also guys i also want to
04:37 - be able to test it so that whenever we
04:39 - pretty much go ahead
04:40 - and type in for example clever
04:41 - programmer here you see like these ones
04:43 - come up right here it would be cool
04:45 - right if we can go ahead and click this
04:46 - and actually upload our thumbnail right
04:48 - here
04:49 - enter the text and things like that so
04:51 - guys i have not built this and if you're
04:52 - wondering what this stuff is this is
04:54 - just a plug-in that we use to sort of
04:55 - check out the stats on videos but
04:57 - guys i haven't built this yet so this is
04:59 - going to be a complete
05:01 - beginner build and this is going to be
05:03 - something where i have no idea how to
05:04 - build this
05:05 - so we're going to go ahead and build
05:06 - this together because i know a lot of
05:08 - you guys said that you noticed that a
05:10 - lot of it was sort of prepared
05:11 - beforehand you're right like we do a bit
05:13 - of
05:13 - preparation because obviously it's a lot
05:15 - of work that we end up going into these
05:16 - videos but
05:17 - i listened to you guys i answered you
05:19 - guys and we are gonna go ahead and
05:21 - build this thing for the first time i've
05:24 - never done this
05:25 - we're gonna go ahead and build this
05:26 - thing for the first time and we are
05:28 - gonna go ahead and get it
05:30 - working okay so let's go ahead and see
05:33 - how this goes guys
05:34 - i can see somebody said oh no oh god
05:37 - okay i think the
05:38 - wi-fi might be acting up um let's go
05:41 - ahead and see hopefully guys we have not
05:43 - got an issue with the stream
05:45 - here today because it's been quite an
05:47 - issue
05:48 - with the streams lately but hopefully
05:51 - it's all good so
05:52 - if you guys can see this stream clearly
05:54 - please let me know in the comments
05:55 - down below so nico nicosi nicosi says so
05:59 - this is like a youtube clone
06:00 - yeah it's pretty much gonna be like a
06:02 - simple version of a youtube clone
06:04 - um but we're gonna basically the purpose
06:06 - of this is so that you guys can go ahead
06:09 - and actually uh and it's really fast
06:12 - it's not me it's him yeah guys
06:14 - if it is lagging i apologize like i said
06:16 - we are working on that
06:18 - it's really tough to get internet speed
06:20 - where i'm at right now i am in london
06:22 - you'd be surprised it's annoying but
06:24 - yeah i mean we're gonna go ahead and
06:25 - make
06:26 - the best of what we have right here okay
06:28 - and let's go ahead and see
06:29 - how that goes okay so let's get started
06:33 - guys
06:33 - so before oh no we got more more lag
06:37 - let's go ahead he gets carbs so okay
06:40 - guys let me go ahead and check the
06:41 - stream out let me go ahead and see
06:42 - what's going on with this
06:45 - so we have
06:50 - well guys we actually have 150 people
06:53 - live right now this is insane
06:57 - okay so the stream looks good on my oh
06:59 - no okay it does lag a little bit guys
07:01 - but this whole video will be back online
07:05 - afterwards okay
07:05 - so what i'd recommend is guys maybe
07:08 - what i would recommend for all of you
07:10 - guys is to essentially go ahead
07:12 - and let the video buffer for about five
07:14 - minutes and then hit play
07:16 - and then that will actually allow you to
07:17 - sort of keep track and you won't have
07:19 - that sort of buffering annoying lag
07:21 - so that's my advice to you guys to get
07:23 - over this sort of annoying internet
07:24 - issue okay
07:25 - and like i said this whole video is
07:26 - going to be uploaded afterwards so don't
07:28 - stress out guys
07:29 - it's completely fine and we're gonna
07:31 - keep keep rolling with this we're gonna
07:32 - keep going okay
07:33 - so without further ado let's jump
07:36 - straight in
07:37 - okay so guys the first step that we want
07:39 - to do is actually go ahead
07:41 - and get this thing up and running so
07:45 - what we're going to do is i'm going to
07:46 - go and show you guys so we've in
07:47 - previous tutorials we've used a bunch
07:49 - of different things um but the number
07:52 - one tool that i love to talk about is
07:53 - create
07:54 - react app so let's go ahead guys and use
07:57 - create
07:58 - react app so let's go ahead and create
08:00 - react app so create react app is how we
08:02 - set up apps guys
08:03 - so in order to get this up and running
08:05 - all you need to do is run this command
08:07 - right here so mpx create react app okay
08:10 - so somebody says will the source code be
08:12 - available i can go ahead and make the
08:14 - source code available if you guys
08:16 - like okay so we can go ahead and do that
08:18 - um if you guys find this valuable
08:20 - okay so let's go ahead and check this
08:23 - out guys
08:24 - so i see a few people asking what is he
08:27 - going to work on guys
08:28 - so i'm just going to give one more round
08:30 - up of what we're actually going to be
08:31 - building today so remember it's a
08:33 - youtube
08:33 - thumbnail testing app guys so
08:35 - essentially it's a youtube sort of
08:37 - it's going to look like this we're going
08:38 - to have an app which looks like this
08:40 - and we're basically going to be able to
08:42 - click this but add
08:44 - our own thumbnail and test what the
08:45 - thumbnail looks like so it's an internal
08:47 - tool
08:48 - and i was going to build this by myself
08:50 - but
08:51 - i was actually thinking that instead of
08:53 - building it by myself i'll just go ahead
08:55 - and build it with you guys because
08:56 - that's fun
08:57 - right like we all like to sort of see
08:58 - like things for the first time
09:00 - and also i've noticed that all of the
09:02 - times i get a lot of questions
09:03 - as to like these things are really
09:05 - preparated uh prepared like
09:06 - and things like that but guys i want you
09:08 - guys to actually follow me along and we
09:10 - can build this whole thing
09:12 - together yo nas is in the house what's
09:14 - up nars
09:15 - we can see let's go ahead and tag in
09:17 - there what's going on bro
09:19 - so everyone who loves nars let's go
09:22 - ahead and drop him some fire in the
09:24 - comments and if you guys want to see
09:25 - nars back on a live stream
09:27 - let us know because i love doing
09:29 - sessions with nars his energy is insane
09:31 - we built a crazy cover 19 tracker that
09:34 - everyone seemed to
09:35 - love and we were happy to keep that
09:37 - stuff coming we
09:38 - just hit over 200 um viewers right now
09:42 - so that's amazing guys
09:43 - that is amazing right what's up guys
09:46 - nice let's go ahead and jump straight in
09:48 - guys so to get started what we are going
09:51 - to do
09:51 - is we are essentially going to go ahead
09:52 - and here i have the youtube covet
09:55 - code that we actually got running last
09:56 - time so actually what i want to go and
09:58 - do here is i want to open up a terminal
09:59 - so item
10:01 - let's go ahead and actually just but uh
10:04 - let's go ahead and pop this to the side
10:06 - let's go ahead and use
10:07 - this right now so you're gonna open up a
10:10 - clear terminal guys and let me just make
10:11 - this a bit bigger for you guys so you
10:13 - guys can go ahead and see that real
10:14 - clear
10:15 - so what you want to do here is run mpx
10:17 - right so you're gonna go into your
10:18 - correct folder so in this case i'm gonna
10:20 - go into my desktop
10:21 - um let's go ahead and somebody says can
10:23 - we make this with angular
10:25 - no guys we are learning react and we're
10:27 - gonna stick with react because i love
10:28 - react
10:29 - so we're gonna go ahead and do mpx
10:30 - create react
10:32 - app right create react app and then we
10:35 - basically need to give it a name so in
10:36 - this case i'm going to say
10:37 - youtube youtube thumbnail
10:41 - creator right youtube thumbnail creator
10:44 - awesome
10:45 - and then what this is going to do guys
10:46 - this is going to go ahead and set up the
10:48 - app
10:48 - i love nars dude like his energy is
10:51 - insane hey
10:52 - we got we got kazzy in the house let's
10:54 - go let's go guys
10:55 - drop some fire if you guys are excited
10:57 - and if you guys are like if you guys
10:58 - like these kind of videos where i'm
11:00 - going to go ahead and build things live
11:01 - with you guys
11:02 - then go ahead and smash the thumbs up
11:05 - button because it lets
11:06 - us know what kind of videos you like to
11:07 - do you know what kind of
11:09 - videos you guys like to see so i can see
11:12 - oh
11:13 - nice we've got uh we've got kazzy saying
11:15 - let's bring nars on this live stream
11:18 - if we can get nars on this live stream
11:20 - um then yeah like we can pretty much
11:22 - we can get ours on this live stream
11:23 - let's ask nars let's get in our zone on
11:26 - this
11:28 - because he said the resolution is wood
11:30 - and potato i know
11:31 - guys i know the resolution is horrible
11:34 - right now
11:35 - but let's just keep going and just make
11:37 - the best of it so
11:39 - guys what you're going to be doing is
11:40 - pretty much installing the
11:42 - react app like this but what we're going
11:44 - to do is we're actually going to plan
11:45 - out our app a little bit right so
11:47 - at this point guys remember like i said
11:49 - i haven't built this up before
11:50 - so this is going to be a first time for
11:52 - me so i'm going to have some kind of
11:53 - drag and drop functionality but
11:55 - we kind of need to build this out so i
11:57 - guess the let's just go ahead and draw
11:58 - on this
11:59 - and let's see what we can do so i need
12:00 - to open up screen brush because i've got
12:02 - a nice little tool here that i like to
12:04 - use
12:04 - and let's go ahead and do this so i'm
12:06 - going to put on freeze so
12:08 - i'm going to basically split this up
12:09 - into different components so the first
12:10 - thing i'm going to focus on building
12:12 - is this and nav bar right here right so
12:15 - we're going to build this nav bar very
12:16 - quickly
12:17 - and then i'm going to build out like
12:18 - this rough sort of sidebar so we have a
12:20 - rough
12:21 - idea of it and then i'm going to go
12:22 - ahead and build each of these little
12:24 - card components
12:25 - and we're basically just going to get a
12:26 - rough layout here guys so we can see a
12:28 - rough
12:28 - quick description and basically what i'm
12:30 - going to do is i'm just going to try and
12:31 - get to this point as fast as we can
12:33 - okay and then what we're going to do is
12:35 - we're going to start implementing some
12:36 - custom functionality so that
12:38 - we can actually go ahead and basically
12:41 - go here
12:42 - click it and then a little thumbnail or
12:44 - some kind of modal will pop
12:45 - up and then we can pretty much upload
12:47 - our own thumbnail or something along
12:49 - those lines okay
12:51 - so if you guys are excited for that
12:52 - smash the thumbs up and let me know
12:54 - and let's go guys let's go so right now
12:58 - um and also guys yeah like i said so
13:00 - remember i did mention
13:01 - that we actually want i can get on let's
13:03 - go nars wants to jump on as well let's
13:05 - go let me grab ours let me grab nars
13:07 - let me go ahead and one second oops what
13:10 - is
13:10 - going on here oops let me go ahead and
13:12 - unlock this
13:15 - let me go ahead and corners guys let's
13:17 - see if we can get another one
13:20 - oh i'm cool in nas guys we'll see if he
13:25 - can get on
13:32 - jump on all right once
13:35 - nasa replies we can actually get him on
13:37 - board and we can see
13:39 - that's insane guys if you guys love that
13:41 - see that's what it's all about
13:43 - uh clever programmer this spontaneous
13:45 - nature right so like even today
13:46 - was a spontaneous video and that's it
13:49 - like
13:50 - uh i can see loads of questions coming
13:51 - in let's go okay
13:53 - so what we oops not that one
13:57 - so let's go ahead and go back to what we
13:59 - were doing guys
14:00 - so nars will give us a call in a sec but
14:02 - guys what you want to do is once you get
14:04 - to this point right so once you get to
14:06 - this point um what you want to
14:08 - essentially do is let me just pull this
14:10 - up so you guys can see
14:12 - um let me minimize this one let's go
14:14 - ahead here so
14:15 - once you get to this point guys what you
14:16 - want to do is you essentially just want
14:18 - to go ahead and do
14:20 - cd into that youtube thumbnail creator
14:22 - okay so you're gonna go into that folder
14:24 - and then you basically i've set up a
14:25 - shortcut here so i just type in code
14:27 - dot and it will actually open up the
14:28 - code editor that you're that you're
14:30 - using so right now we use vs code
14:32 - over at clever programmer and if you
14:33 - want to install that sort of shortcut
14:36 - what you need to do is hold on bro we
14:39 - can't breathe so you probably reacted
14:41 - like i see those nice uh this is a
14:45 - that's a cool comment um so guys what
14:46 - you want to do is to get this actually
14:48 - up and running with that shortcut you're
14:49 - gonna help
14:50 - press command shift p command shift p
14:53 - and then you'll see this pop up right
14:55 - and you can go ahead and install i think
14:57 - it's if you type in yeah here you go
14:58 - install
14:59 - so you do install code command in uh
15:02 - code inside is command and pass so you
15:04 - guys can see that right
15:05 - and then basically yours will say
15:07 - install code command impart
15:09 - and that will actually go ahead and work
15:11 - for you and it works the way you need it
15:12 - to work
15:14 - so um that will actually go ahead and
15:15 - give you that sort of code dot

15:17 - so i'm going to go ahead and make this
15:19 - huge for you guys
15:21 - so you guys can see this real nice so
15:22 - what we want to do is once you have your
15:24 - app
15:24 - up here guys what you want to do is go
15:26 - ahead and do mpm start
15:27 - and that will spin up your react app
15:29 - okay so once you have your react app
15:31 - running
15:32 - then you can pretty much go ahead okay
15:35 - so nars is ready guys so once it we're
15:37 - gonna get the app up and running so we
15:38 - just
15:39 - actually spun it up right now so we have
15:41 - this up and running
15:42 - right here so um this isn't showing the
15:45 - full app but let's go ahead and bring

16:42 - well nice have you heard what we're
16:44 - building on monday
16:45 - what are we building what are we
16:46 - building we're burning a tinder clone on
16:48 - monday
16:49 - oh a tinder clown yeah oh man a lot of
16:52 - people will
16:53 - be able to use that let's go they'll be
16:55 - jokes right
16:59 - we've got tick tock we've got a few
17:00 - things coming up this week
17:02 - spotify cologne i think as well right
17:04 - mm-hmm
17:05 - we've got a spot of fireclone we've got
17:07 - tiktok and we've got
17:09 - uh a youtube full clone so today we're
17:11 - going ahead and building
17:13 - so we we needed an internal uh an
17:15 - internal tool to basically go ahead and
17:17 - see
17:18 - you know like the thumbnails what they
17:20 - look like and stuff right so
17:23 - pretty much like these thumbnails over
17:25 - here instead of actually going ahead and
17:27 - what we used to do is we used to
17:28 - actually go and inspect it guys
17:29 - and we would basically go ahead and swap
17:31 - the picture but it's kind of annoying to
17:32 - do that every time
17:34 - and then right our own little thumbnail
17:35 - in there so instead we thought let's
17:36 - just build an app where it basically
17:37 - does that for us
17:39 - okay it's kind of overkill but it's kind
17:41 - of fun you know
17:43 - hey you know what sometimes you gotta do
17:44 - overkill man exactly
17:47 - so let's go ahead i just got the app
17:50 - started up
17:51 - so here you go we've got the app up and
17:52 - running here i don't know why it's not
17:54 - showing the entire oh there we go let me
17:55 - go ahead and make that
17:56 - there we go can you still see me by the
17:58 - way you can see you can still see me
18:00 - right
18:00 - oh yeah yeah i still got you in the
18:02 - corner let me go ahead and actually fix
18:04 - that one second

18:07 - so let me go ahead and bring both of us
18:08 - on
18:09 - um how do i do that
18:13 - so i go to oh god this is where
18:16 - this is like it's messy okay
18:19 - that's it and then this is very like
18:21 - live where you're basically where you
18:22 - are live
18:23 - and and you're trying to basically it's
18:25 - like you're producing your show alive

19:57 - okay there's two people down there
19:59 - hey there we go and then lock that there
20:02 - we go
20:03 - get out of pip mode we're not in pit
20:04 - mode are we i think we're good
20:07 - yeah what is pimp mode i think oh i
20:09 - think it was a little bit delayed you
20:11 - know with the live stream
20:12 - oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i think
20:15 - we're good to go now
20:16 - let's do it let's keep going let's do it
20:17 - right yeah okay so guys
20:20 - when you get your app up and running
20:21 - you'll basically start it off and then
20:23 - you'll
20:23 - you'll get this screen all right so once
20:25 - you're at this screen it's a good
20:26 - starting point
20:26 - so now what you want to go ahead and do
20:28 - and that we call this like the cleanup
20:30 - process right
20:31 - so you want to go ahead and delete this
20:32 - file so go ahead and get rid of this one
20:35 - go ahead and get rid of the test files
20:36 - because we don't need those
20:37 - and the logo the svg which is that
20:39 - little spinning react icon that you guys
20:41 - saw
20:41 - and then it's going to start freaking
20:43 - out because it's like oh my god that you
20:44 - you got rid of files that shouldn't be
20:46 - gotten rid of so i'm going to go ahead
20:47 - and hide the terminal
20:49 - for now but we basically just need to
20:50 - clean this up we go ahead
20:52 - delete that and then here i just get rid
20:54 - of this entire block
20:55 - right so this entire block and then
20:57 - let's just go ahead and say like uh
20:59 - let's just call it youtube let's just
21:01 - say hello
21:03 - clever programmers
21:07 - nice all right so hello programs and
21:10 - then we save it
21:11 - and then guys you'll get this you'll get
21:13 - to this screen right
21:14 - so once you're on this screen what i see
21:16 - so you can see the text is still
21:18 - centered right so we still have some css
21:20 - in play
21:21 - so what you want to go ahead and do is
21:22 - go to app.css go ahead and just get rid
21:24 - of everything there and then once you
21:26 - save that
21:27 - you'll see it actually snapped over so
21:28 - if i go ahead and undo that and click
21:30 - save
21:30 - you see that like that's with this sort
21:32 - of css is automatically there
21:34 - but once we go ahead and delete that and
21:36 - i save it
21:37 - you can see it automatically gets rid of
21:39 - a lot of the code that was um
21:41 - the sort of that's when you when you
21:42 - remove css when you add css
21:44 - when i remove their css oh okay okay
21:47 - yeah because they kind of add some css
21:49 - we don't we don't want any rules
21:51 - so we just have a blank canvas to work
21:52 - from gotcha
21:54 - yeah and then what i like to do is add
21:56 - one more rule so guys can you see
21:58 - like over here right we get this like
22:00 - kind of empty space like up here so you
22:02 - see this like we get this empty margin
22:04 - and it's always annoying right like we
22:05 - don't want this empty margin here
22:07 - so what we need to do to get rid of that
22:09 - is guys how do you think how do you
22:10 - think
22:10 - we could get rid of that drop down in
22:11 - the comments yeah let us know
22:13 - literally yeah exactly that's a really
22:15 - good point so we can go ahead and let uh
22:16 - let us know in the comments
22:18 - we also have guys just in case you're
22:19 - wondering we do have a bunch of styling
22:21 - in here right
22:22 - uh and you can see they actually do
22:23 - apply the sort of magic rule up here but
22:25 - that doesn't always work
22:27 - i like to actually we can add it in this
22:29 - level but you see like they've done it
22:30 - here margin zero
22:32 - but the actual thing is and we'll see if
22:34 - it comes through i think it's a little
22:35 - bit delayed on the comments
22:37 - um but what i would say here guys is the
22:39 - magic rule that we're looking for
22:41 - is basically we want to say to
22:42 - everything go ahead
22:44 - and give everything a margin of zero and
22:46 - look this is what the app looks like
22:48 - before right and as soon as i hit save
22:50 - so i'm about to hit save on this right
22:51 - now so as soon as i hit save
22:53 - boom watch what happens yeah you see
22:55 - that there we go
22:57 - nice yeah so it kind of snapped to the
22:59 - top left corner
23:00 - and that is basically like going to be
23:02 - that's like quite important step because
23:04 - yeah there we go everyone got it right
23:06 - nice
23:06 - and look at that elon eon stories
23:09 - because that margin zero
23:10 - looks like gold margin zero dang a lot
23:12 - you guys are killing it
23:13 - yeah look we got everyone here we got
23:15 - margin padding oh someone said padding
23:17 - as well okay interesting
23:18 - interesting yeah two padding as as well
23:21 - yeah
23:22 - so the the point is that that way at
23:23 - least you've got a blank canvas that you
23:25 - can kind of work from right
23:27 - um so now what we're going to do is so
23:29 - now
23:30 - this is actually the first time we've
23:31 - gone into a build we're pretty much
23:34 - nothing's prepared oh seriously yes so
23:37 - nothing's bad right
23:38 - yeah this is entirely like we just have
23:40 - to build this out like
23:42 - all right let's do it actually hold on
23:44 - bro bro since they brought someone
23:46 - like this can you do can you do vs code
23:49 - share can you
23:50 - yeah let's do it let's do it let's do it
23:52 - let's do it guys so
23:53 - vs code this setup live show right now
23:55 - so
23:56 - uh start collaboration session there we
23:59 - go
24:01 - yeah just send me slack as well and send
24:03 - me slack yeah
24:05 - there you go guys by the way by the way
24:08 - guys who was able to finish the color
24:10 - tracker i know a lot of you guys
24:11 - probably
24:11 - have saw us on this who's able to finish
24:13 - the cover track let us know in the
24:14 - comments below that was an epic
24:16 - video yeah like everyone seemed to love
24:19 - that video dude
24:20 - yeah that one took off like crazy yeah
24:23 - yeah
24:24 - and uh that was actually pretty cool
24:26 - that was showing you guys how to use an
24:27 - api with react
24:29 - and uh and it looks beautiful at the end
24:31 - guys so definitely worth going
24:33 - and checking that one out if you're
24:34 - interested um
24:36 - let's go and see so now this will be
24:39 - more you can
24:39 - share your logos as well oh yeah okay so
24:42 - guys yeah when you're sharing right you
24:44 - see nars just joined in right so you can
24:45 - see over here
24:46 - it says no it's just joined your
24:48 - collaboration session so that's the
24:50 - first thing you want to do and then that
24:51 - basically you guys can see that nars is
24:52 - in here right now
24:53 - which is so dope that means we can code
24:55 - together right now you see when we have
24:57 - an
24:57 - app running at localhost 3000 so this is
25:00 - the app running at low cost 3000.
25:02 - basically what you guys want to go ahead
25:03 - and do is share that port so now if i go
25:06 - if i go and show you so
25:07 - um i think i am sharing 3000. oh you are
25:09 - okay yes if you click
25:11 - on this one right here it looks like you
25:14 - yeah if you click on that right there
25:15 - then it means basically nars can access
25:17 - my local
25:18 - which is insane that means we can code
25:19 - together we can do everything sort of
25:21 - together
25:22 - um nice okay there you go and guys it's
25:24 - like google docs
25:28 - this is epic man holy yeah it's
25:31 - crazy right
25:33 - yeah so now guys what we're going to do
25:35 - now is because we pretty much are like
25:37 - in a very experimental phase this one's
25:39 - kind of more to show them like
25:41 - pretty much like you know how we go from
25:43 - like building the app out
25:45 - and like how we go from styling it all
25:46 - and we can kind of ask questions while
25:48 - we
25:48 - answer questions while we do it but it's
25:50 - sort of like showing them that like if
25:51 - we were like it's natural to run into
25:53 - those debugging problems
25:54 - and it's to sort of face those issues
25:56 - that you face like
25:57 - um so yeah the first thing that we were
26:00 - going to do
26:00 - guys is go ahead and actually sort of
26:02 - break this down so i showed everyone
26:03 - earlier that like
26:04 - you were basically going to go ahead and
26:06 - like this is a component the header
26:07 - component
26:08 - we're going to go ahead and roughly
26:09 - build this out and then go ahead and
26:12 - sort of build like this little sidebar
26:14 - and we're going to get it roughly sort
26:15 - of looking like not not exactly at this
26:18 - point we just kind of want to outline it
26:19 - first
26:20 - right and even these little cards you
26:22 - see like just get them to a point where
26:23 - we can pretty much get them in place
26:25 - and then we'll sort of style it and get
26:26 - it tweaked right
26:28 - right and so and and so the goal is
26:30 - pretty much the goal is pretty much to
26:31 - create like a
26:32 - a almost like a youtube clone right like
26:34 - youtube clone but a way to
26:36 - test thumbnails is that what you're
26:37 - saying exactly exactly that
26:39 - yeah so it's a youtube clone to test out
26:42 - thumbnails
26:42 - so in this case and we're also going to
26:44 - have support for this screen so you see
26:45 - on this screen so
26:46 - when you click on the search bar we're
26:48 - going to basically have it so it goes to
26:49 - forward slash search
26:51 - just as a sort of test and then this
26:52 - will render like this kind of view
26:55 - and we'll basically show what it looks
26:56 - like on this screen
26:58 - which would be nice it would be kind of
26:59 - cool right obviously guys all of this
27:01 - stuff is like extra we don't
27:03 - this is all the sort of extra plugin
27:04 - this isn't here on the actual youtube
27:06 - so you won't see your stuff okay so
27:09 - so let's get started so what should we
27:11 - so should we should we like write down
27:13 - some of the steps i could think of like
27:14 - a to-do like steps in terms of like
27:16 - so we have them kind of have them kind
27:18 - of like in a process base what do you
27:19 - think
27:20 - yeah let's do it so that means some kind
27:22 - of notes right or we could do that one
27:24 - i think we can do it on code right you
27:26 - can do it yeah yeah like what i like to
27:28 - like i like to create like a readme file
27:29 - like md file like a readme file
27:31 - nice name it like a to do dot
27:34 - md or whatever whatever it is you want
27:36 - to name it and then yeah
27:37 - beautiful there we go and you can hit
27:39 - that little thing right here and it
27:40 - shows you a really nice little
27:41 - preview you see that yeah yeah yeah yeah
27:44 - oh
27:45 - oh yeah that's cool that's really cool
27:48 - so let's do this all right so steps yeah
27:51 - let's go ahead and do steps so the steps
27:53 - that we're going to basically
27:54 - have guys to get going oh nice smart
27:57 - hey look at that so you can see there we
28:00 - go
28:02 - i don't know how do you do like one oh
28:04 - there you go nice yeah yeah
28:07 - the first step guys is let's go ahead
28:08 - and maybe like let's go and build the
28:10 - header maybe
28:12 - yeah so the header component um step two
28:16 - should we maybe do the sidebar yeah it's
28:18 - just a sidebar
28:19 - that's the sidebar and then uh yeah the
28:22 - solid and then i would see and then the
28:23 - main the main component
28:25 - yes main body component i would say
28:28 - right
28:28 - yeah so build body and card component
28:31 - right
28:31 - yeah yeah yeah and then
28:34 - there we go yeah and then we're
28:37 - basically
28:38 - we can go ahead and say so i think once
28:40 - we get this page going
28:42 - maybe it'll be a good idea to sort of
28:43 - figure out you know like that sort of
28:45 - how we're gonna solve that problem of
28:48 - where we click on a thumbnail so when we
28:50 - go ahead and we click on like a
28:51 - thumbnail over here
28:52 - and like so i was thinking maybe like
28:54 - some kind of pop-up which opens like a
28:56 - drag and drop sort of thing
28:58 - so you drag and drop a file and it saves
29:01 - it to state
29:02 - and it basically you know like it will
29:03 - render it here so
29:05 - when we will you have any default will
29:07 - we have any default images
29:09 - in there that's that's question one
29:10 - right will there be any default images
29:12 - yeah so good question so i think maybe
29:14 - like what we could do it actually is
29:16 - maybe have like
29:17 - this one and this one to be like
29:19 - placeholders and everything else would
29:21 - have like a default image
29:22 - yeah yeah okay let's yeah let's do that
29:25 - let's have like a
29:26 - like if you see that image right that
29:27 - could be basically like um
29:30 - you can almost have i mean i'm not sure
29:31 - like what's easier if a drag and drop
29:33 - is easier or what is easier um but we
29:36 - could probably have to
29:36 - have that box just be a drag and drop
29:39 - and then you know and that's it pretty
29:40 - much right
29:41 - yeah i mean something like that right
29:43 - like or some kind of like upload
29:44 - a file button or something yeah you're
29:47 - like you're like like you get that
29:48 - little like a little upload file button
29:50 - on there
29:51 - yeah yeah oh like when you hover over
29:52 - right like when you hover over it yeah
29:54 - like we could do that
29:55 - like a hover over thing or like even
29:57 - like because we basically want to be
29:58 - able to
29:59 - even customize this stuff you know
30:03 - there's some kind of a modal maybe like
30:05 - that pops up when we click on the
30:06 - thumbnail
30:07 - that could be cool yeah so yeah i'll
30:09 - actually i like the idea i actually
30:10 - that's probably a better and easier idea
30:12 - so when you click because a model is
30:13 - easy to bring up right
30:14 - yeah you can always very easy so you
30:16 - basically click on the thumbnail
30:17 - when you click on the thumbnail it
30:19 - brings up a model you choose an image
30:21 - you choose the title you know you choose
30:23 - anything you want to change and that's
30:25 - it and it saves it
30:26 - yeah let's go yeah exactly let's do that
30:27 - and then we can put the title the
30:29 - description the sort of
30:30 - and stuff like that right yeah yeah
30:32 - there we go let's go ahead and do that
30:33 - so yeah if you guys find this exciting
30:36 - because this is like literally me and
30:37 - nars are building this
30:38 - we've never done this right so it's like
30:41 - we're live as well doing this
30:42 - for you guys as well this is going to be
30:44 - really interesting i will say
30:46 - yeah so we're going to run into issues
30:48 - hopefully it will go smooth
30:50 - nice okay awesome um
30:54 - let's go oh i i don't i don't think it
30:55 - will go smooth i'll be honest with you
30:57 - that's for sure
30:58 - but but we're gonna finish it that's the
31:00 - most important we are gonna finish it
31:01 - exactly
31:03 - so we're gonna build the helicopter
31:04 - build the sidebar component build the
31:06 - body and card and then let's go ahead
31:08 - and maybe
31:08 - get that modal build modal component
31:12 - right um and uh and i guess like
31:15 - something like unsolve
31:17 - the thumbnail some of the thumbnails
31:19 - stuff
31:23 - so we'll go ahead and we'll just attack
31:26 - with this when we get
31:26 - let's just let's just make this let's
31:28 - just make point five or just like
31:30 - imagine like one but just build some
31:31 - stuff you know yeah like point by just
31:33 - build some stuff that's point five you
31:34 - know
31:34 - exactly like build build
31:40 - guys drop in the comments below if you
31:42 - just want to build if you just want
31:43 - to build just drop that in the
31:44 - comment below you know
31:48 - okay nice all right i think we should
31:51 - jump in so step one
31:52 - building the header component so this is
31:54 - the step that we are on right now oh god
31:56 - what happened
31:56 - okay we are on this step right here so
31:59 - building the header component
32:01 - so the youtube header what i tend to do
32:03 - is whenever i do a clone or something
32:04 - right
32:05 - i just go ahead over to the app and i'll
32:07 - basically go ahead and inspect it
32:09 - and i kind of just like grab everything
32:11 - from it so i kind of grab the sort of
32:13 - rough dimensions that we've got a
32:14 - youtube logo over here
32:16 - um and then you sort of like just sort
32:18 - of piece it together like that i guess
32:21 - like even this right here because we're
32:22 - not going to be implementing the full
32:24 - sort of functionality this is just to
32:25 - get a rough sort of
32:26 - look and feel of the youtube app right
32:29 - right right right right like a youtube
32:32 - sort of logo on the top left the search
32:34 - box which would be cool and then sort of
32:35 - like this stuff is all extra
32:37 - but even like these three icons or four
32:39 - icons on the right
32:40 - so good demonstration of flexbox here
32:43 - right
32:44 - so are we gonna use any grid are we just
32:46 - using flexbox or are you gonna use
32:47 - any like row column grid or no or just
32:49 - material ui right
32:50 - um so actually good point let's use
32:52 - material ui yeah let's use material ui
32:54 - so
32:54 - guys if you guys don't know what
32:55 - material ui is is we've used it in a
32:58 - bunch of projects before
32:59 - oh oops material ui it's
33:02 - material yeah there we go
33:06 - it's a popular react ui framework by
33:08 - google and it basically gives you all of
33:10 - the google looking stuff like you're
33:12 - basically going to get yeah
33:13 - it's a lot like google like stuff like
33:14 - apps so you need to run this command
33:16 - which is an npm install material ui
33:18 - core so you need to go ahead and open up
33:21 - your code
33:22 - and basically do this command so it's
33:24 - going to be
33:25 - i like to go ahead and open up a second
33:27 - terminal so you have the left one
33:28 - running the app the right one running
33:30 - um the other stuff so let's go ahead and
33:32 - make this one much smaller
33:33 - there we go and we do npm install
33:35 - material ui core
33:37 - and nice did you know you don't actually
33:38 - have to do save
33:41 - what do you oh when you do npm install
33:43 - yeah why
33:45 - really yeah i don't know because he told
33:47 - me this and then i read up on it
33:48 - apparently nowadays like with the new
33:50 - version by default it saves to the
33:52 - package dependencies
33:54 - oh dang kazi you fancy man you
33:57 - fancy that's cool right yeah
34:00 - you don't have to do that anymore like
34:02 - saves that headache okay
34:04 - i didn't know that honestly dang all
34:05 - right cool yeah
34:07 - so guys that successfully installed so
34:09 - you can see there like everything's sort
34:11 - of done it says added your packages
34:13 - and that is all done so now we can go
34:14 - ahead and drop that down
34:16 - um but like what we're gonna do first
34:18 - guys is go ahead and sort of introduce
34:20 - a component here so some kind of header
34:23 - right
34:23 - so like this right obviously this
34:25 - doesn't exist right now so i would go
34:27 - ahead and do
34:28 - is go ahead and create a file called
34:30 - header
34:31 - oops header dot like this
34:34 - and then guys really really cool
34:36 - extension that we talk about a lot is
34:38 - something called
34:39 - it's called um react oh no is it
34:43 - snippets
34:44 - which snippets um
34:48 - es7 there you go es7 snippets so this
34:51 - one right here so this top one right
34:52 - here guys
34:53 - go ahead and install this like this is
34:55 - such a good uh uh
34:56 - such a good extension and what you do is
34:58 - he does it gives you like these snippets
34:59 - so
35:00 - for example where we have a header right
35:02 - here what we can do is we can do rfce
35:05 - and basically boom it gives you the
35:06 - whole react sort of code
35:08 - for that and it even inputs the file
35:10 - name which is dope
35:13 - yeah yeah that saves you a bunch of
35:15 - headache so so
35:16 - actually i'm actually because guys who
35:18 - knows who knows what like this is right
35:19 - here like this
35:20 - function header like if you know i'm
35:22 - really curious because i always say this
35:23 - is you know what you're learning kind of
35:25 - react at the same time
35:26 - yeah like who knows like what is
35:29 - this like what is this like what kind of
35:32 - a component is this
35:34 - you know if you do know drop that in the
35:36 - comments below and we'll see if you guys
35:38 - are right but yeah let's continue on
35:39 - exactly and like guys i always see
35:41 - comments about like uh class space first
35:43 - functional and those sort of style
35:45 - things right like what we're doing here
35:47 - is we're basically writing something
35:48 - called a functional component so this is
35:50 - a functional component
35:52 - right and basically the purpose of this
35:54 - is it's just like it's just a function
35:56 - it's literally a javascript function
35:58 - which returns some jsx and jsx is
36:00 - basically javascript where you can
36:02 - basically have some javascript code
36:03 - inside of it
36:04 - so you can say like abc and obviously
36:06 - this isn't going to do much but like you
36:07 - can actually go ahead
36:08 - and like you could do something like
36:09 - this return abc or like something
36:12 - similar like that but you could
36:13 - basically do a bunch of stuff in here
36:15 - and or run javascript code inside and it
36:17 - will just return a block of html
36:19 - and the purpose of this guys is because
36:22 - what you want to do then is go back into
36:24 - your app and just pull in
36:25 - that header right and you can reuse
36:27 - stuff like that so in this case
36:29 - what we're going to go ahead and do is i
36:30 - like to basically press
36:32 - so if you actually go to the end of the
36:34 - line and you press
36:35 - ctrl spacebar it pops up like this and
36:37 - it says autoimport from header
36:40 - so you can do that it pops it in click
36:41 - save go to
36:43 - nice click save and then you actually go
36:45 - ahead and say like i
36:46 - am a header right right
36:50 - and what we can do now is what i like to
36:52 - do is i split these two files
36:53 - so you drag that over then you've got
36:55 - your your function
36:56 - or your app over here and then you've
36:58 - got your header component over here and
36:59 - this gives you like a very nice overview
37:02 - of the two things right so what we can
37:03 - go ahead and do is we can go ahead and
37:05 - check our app
37:05 - so you can see over here now you've got
37:08 - like i'm a header
37:09 - so at the very top it shows you i am a
37:12 - header so i'm going to go and zoom in
37:13 - here
37:14 - you can see i am header there we go okay
37:17 - so that's nice so now what we're going
37:19 - to do is we need to actually go ahead
37:21 - and make it look like this header
37:23 - right so there's a bunch of things that
37:25 - we need to do to get it to this point
37:28 - so the first one does material i have
37:30 - have a header like that
37:32 - that may be at this point uh we can
37:33 - check we can definitely check so let's
37:35 - go ahead and
37:36 - check um materials
37:39 - like a nav like material ui nav or
37:40 - something let's go ahead and have a look
37:43 - so you've got
37:44 - let's search so nav i think they've got
37:47 - they've got like a bottom navigation
37:49 - so bottom navigation like this kind of
37:51 - thing you see
37:52 - [Music]
37:54 - but then we need like a top navigation
37:56 - so
37:57 - they have i don't think they do
38:00 - i think but what we could do here is to
38:02 - be honest it's literally just a case of
38:04 - it's a white
38:05 - background so it's okay and then we can
38:08 - use flexbox to get this styling and
38:10 - basically what we can do is we can say
38:12 - that the search so this field right here
38:14 - takes up most of the
38:16 - most of the space so you see like it
38:18 - takes up pretty much all of the middle
38:20 - and then this gets pushed to the left
38:22 - and this stuff gets pushed to the right
38:24 - so um those of you who are comfortable
38:26 - with flexbox or you've used flexbox
38:28 - before
38:29 - definitely let us know in the comments
38:31 - because we love flexbox and we
38:33 - we use it all the time on the channel um
38:36 - yeah that'd be
38:37 - i think we should definitely drop a
38:38 - maybe a like a flexbox foggy kind of
38:40 - video
38:40 - you know that would be cool that'd be
38:42 - cool if you guys want to see a flashback
38:43 - from
38:44 - a flexbox tutorial with a fun game let
38:47 - us know in the comments
38:48 - in the comments below and we'll do a
38:49 - live call like that as well exactly guys
38:51 - yeah
38:51 - just let us know no we don't right so
38:55 - jumping back in guys we have the header
38:57 - and then we have this right here so
38:59 - what i might actually get go ahead and
39:00 - do is actually to make it very quick to
39:02 - show them the app
39:03 - let me go ahead and pull the app in here
39:05 - as well
39:07 - and then that way we can go ahead and do
39:08 - this we can show like this is what the
39:10 - app looks like
39:11 - oh yes oops that's actually not using up
39:13 - the full space i hate it when chrome
39:15 - goes you know full screen by default
39:17 - yeah oh i know yeah yeah yeah it's so
39:19 - annoying like what you need to do is
39:21 - just do this
39:22 - do this boom and there we go
39:26 - that's well nice nice
39:29 - there we go
39:32 - so guys we have the app here so we have
39:35 - with the the header and the snare and
39:37 - the the goal is to get to this point
39:39 - right
39:40 - so the first thing that we can notice is
39:42 - that um
39:43 - oops and this is now too low i need to
39:46 - get this there we go
39:47 - yep so the first thing is a white
39:50 - background guys we want to get a white
39:51 - background here
39:52 - so let's go ahead and get that done
39:56 - so in the the code basically imagine
39:59 - this is our container so this is gonna
40:00 - be the thing surrounding it so
40:02 - i like to just draft it out so we have
40:03 - like the youtube logo
40:05 - on the left we have the search box in
40:08 - the middle
40:09 - and then we have the sort of the
40:11 - remainder so let's just call them the
40:12 - right side logos
40:13 - right so the right side logos and
40:16 - basically you can see here
40:18 - we have pretty much like a rough sort of
40:20 - scale or outline of what we're going to
40:22 - do now
40:23 - so under on the top left we'll have the
40:25 - youtube logo middle we'll have a search
40:26 - box and then right side logos and then
40:28 - what i like to use is something called
40:29 - bem
40:30 - so here everything should follow like a
40:32 - convention where
40:33 - it's the component and then it's like
40:35 - the element that you're talking about so
40:37 - in this case
40:38 - that the parent component usually has
40:40 - the component's name
40:42 - as your class name for your outside
40:43 - container so
40:45 - we have header here and then what we
40:47 - need to do is make a header.css file
40:50 - to include some css here so let's go
40:52 - ahead and do that
40:53 - and to use this so i'll make this a bit
40:55 - easier for you guys to see
40:57 - so to use this now we need to import it
40:59 - so let's go ahead and import
41:01 - let's do header dot css
41:05 - there we go and now oh so you input the
41:08 - css into individual files right
41:11 - not not like into a batch index file
41:13 - right exactly
41:14 - and then that means that your styling is
41:16 - basically component specific
41:18 - so gotcha gotcha what i like to do
41:20 - sometimes is pull over the
41:22 - the css file on the left and the code on
41:24 - the right and then this is a really nice
41:26 - way of seeing like your your stuff like
41:27 - left
41:28 - you know like left to right yeah yeah so
41:31 - here what we can do is just to get a
41:32 - rough
41:33 - sort of demonstration we can do like h1
41:35 - logo
41:36 - h2 like h1 search box
41:40 - and then here h1 um
41:44 - let's just say write logos okay so what
41:47 - i like to do is just sort of get a rough
41:49 - thing so right now you can see that
41:50 - there's these three things and they're
41:51 - just stacked on top of each other right
41:53 - yeah which is obviously like not what we
41:55 - want so guys
41:56 - what we can do here is we can actually
41:57 - apply flexbox so imagine what we've
41:59 - actually done right now is this is the
42:01 - header that we've just
42:02 - created to this right here but by
42:05 - default
42:06 - what happens is the display type is
42:08 - something called block
42:09 - and block just naturally puts one
42:11 - element it gives one element full width
42:14 - and it basically takes up
42:15 - an entire row and then it basically just
42:16 - stacks them like this right
42:18 - yeah so how do we fix that guys like how
42:21 - if you know that how do we
42:22 - fix that that issue i'm sure you guys
42:25 - know that drop down in the comments
42:26 - below if you do
42:27 - we'll give you some extra points exactly
42:30 - are you coming through right now one
42:31 - second is this
42:32 - is coming through right yeah yeah yeah
42:34 - should be able to
42:35 - yeah yeah because it says yeah it's
42:38 - coming through yeah
42:43 - i hope so you guys hear me
42:46 - like if you guys hear me let us know let
42:48 - me know in the comments let us know in
42:49 - the comments like can you hear me like
42:50 - yo yo yo what's up what's up what's up
42:52 - you know
42:52 - yeah are you not have you got the
42:54 - comments open right now
42:56 - yeah i do yeah nice okay dope
42:59 - um let's go so right now what we are
43:02 - going to do
43:03 - is actually yeah so guys what we need to
43:05 - do now is we need to change this display
43:07 - type so
43:07 - it goes and uses the flexbox rules right
43:10 - um so now what we're going to go ahead
43:12 - and do is
43:13 - we have the header right so we're going
43:15 - to do is we're going to target the
43:16 - header
43:17 - and we're going to say display so by
43:19 - default it gives it this
43:20 - it gives it display block right which is
43:22 - where it stacks them on top of each
43:23 - other
43:24 - it's actually the children element so
43:26 - this is our parent
43:27 - this one right here and then these are
43:29 - all children inside of it
43:30 - right so now we're gonna do is we're
43:32 - gonna go ahead and basically
43:34 - do display flex now before i click save
43:37 - guys
43:37 - i'm gonna click save on this but watch
43:39 - what happens here right
43:40 - so as soon as i click save look at the
43:42 - difference it makes so i'm going to go
43:43 - ahead and actually open this on two
43:45 - screens so we can do
43:47 - a cool little demo whenever i do stuff
43:48 - like that so
43:51 - let me go ahead and do this so
43:55 - yeah so as soon as i hit save guys look
43:57 - what happens so
43:59 - watch it so as soon as i hit save it
44:00 - goes display flex but it goes into a row
44:03 - do you see that so everything kind of
44:04 - stacked on top like next to each other
44:08 - beautiful beautiful just so easy just
44:10 - display flex guys seriously
44:11 - um display flex by default is going to
44:14 - actually just
44:15 - go ahead and put everything in a row and
44:17 - it will only use up the space it needs
44:18 - to use
44:19 - so now what we can go ahead and do is
44:21 - actually go and basically do this
44:23 - the following so we can say right now
44:24 - they're all next to each other and it
44:26 - hasn't got any rules so we can say
44:27 - justify content
44:29 - space between and what this will do is
44:31 - as soon as i save this so that
44:33 - before i hit save so right now this is
44:35 - without and if i click
44:36 - save what i can do is yeah you see that
44:39 - there we go
44:40 - nice nice so if i undo that um there we
44:43 - go it has this and if i
44:45 - redo it space between goes ahead and
44:47 - does that i mean
44:48 - and we can even do like the space evenly
44:50 - which will make it like even like put
44:51 - some patty on the right hand side as
44:52 - well so if you do like for example if
44:54 - you try like space evenly for example
44:55 - yeah so as soon as i hit save
44:59 - check that out nice
45:02 - might not be the best yeah yeah yeah
45:04 - let's put it back to space between
45:06 - but that's a cool use case yeah so like
45:08 - in some situations you might want space
45:09 - evenly but in our case
45:11 - we want space between so it will push it
45:13 - like everything
45:14 - to its appropriate space right yeah
45:17 - and that's nice okay so that's pretty
45:19 - much we're getting there
45:21 - um so the next part is what i like to do
45:23 - now is actually sort of
45:25 - put containers around these different
45:27 - areas because right now
45:29 - we have these single elements which are
45:30 - basically is not very useful for us
45:32 - right like the logo yeah sure could be
45:34 - the first child
45:34 - but i like to go ahead and do the
45:35 - following i use emmet which is like the
45:37 - shortcut for writing class names
45:39 - so i do div dot and then here we can say
45:41 - header let's just say logo
45:43 - and you see that it pops in and actually
45:45 - gives us a container
45:46 - with a little stuff you're too fancy
45:49 - sonny
45:49 - i know dude
45:51 - [Laughter]
45:53 - british shortcut you know
45:57 - so what we could do there is we can go
45:59 - ahead and do the same for the search box
46:00 - so div
46:01 - dot uh header search
46:05 - and we can go ahead and copy that in
46:07 - there and we can do the same
46:08 - for this one so we can say div header
46:10 - and while he's doing this guys
46:12 - just like keep in mind like you know the
46:13 - way we build this stuff and you know
46:15 - sunny i
46:16 - anybody else um you know you can see how
46:19 - we like to just right away you know put
46:21 - down the html
46:22 - put down the structure and then with the
46:24 - css we basically we figure that out
46:26 - later
46:26 - right sunny right now he put down the
46:28 - logo the search box the right logo is
46:29 - right
46:30 - he put the html structure down right
46:32 - away then right away and then after that
46:34 - we go
46:34 - we go ahead and we play with css to see
46:37 - how we want we want to make it look like
46:39 - so let's just keep that in mind
46:40 - it's always a really good process to go
46:43 - through
46:43 - as you're building you know anything
46:45 - pretty much you know anything else
46:47 - exactly um i just wondering so
46:51 - you went live on the wrong one oh snap
46:56 - i actually didn't change the i didn't
46:59 - change the restroom oh damn it okay it's
47:03 - i i think i over it a live stream
47:07 - wait what yeah oh man
47:10 - well i think i i done i didn't change
47:12 - the event oh damn it i changed
47:14 - everything
47:15 - no it will create it will create a new
47:16 - one all right will it i think yeah
47:19 - it will just create a new one because
47:19 - that event is already has already
47:21 - expired
47:22 - okay okay nice all right yeah yeah so
47:32 - christ is divided right nice
47:38 - but now guys we can see like we've got
47:40 - it sort of near enough like we just need
47:42 - this sort of input and like a logo here
47:44 - so we're going to quickly tackle that um
47:47 - so let's go ahead and do that so here we
47:49 - have
47:50 - so we have a search bar so instead we
47:52 - just want to input and we need a
47:55 - a button so like this so it's just the
47:57 - button would have an icon inside of it
47:59 - so just type in icon for now
48:01 - and here we should have something like
48:02 - this so
48:04 - um wait a minute this isn't right
48:06 - where's the input oh oh my
48:08 - oh that's very large this is because
48:10 - yeah wait this is strange
48:13 - where's the input though still uh let me
48:16 - show you on the screen because this is
48:17 - actually the correct screen so there we
48:20 - go
48:20 - okay so it's very tight there we go okay
48:23 - okay okay
48:24 - super small over here guys um but what
48:26 - we want to do is basically you see that
48:28 - input is
48:28 - tiny so right now that's really hard to
48:31 - see i don't know why it doesn't come up
48:32 - on this screen for some reason um
48:34 - really yeah that's being strange oh yeah
48:36 - there we go yeah nice
48:38 - yeah so guys you see like this right
48:40 - here so it's very hard to see but like
48:42 - this right here is the search bar
48:44 - okay and right now we want this to take
48:46 - up the majority of the space
48:48 - here right right the way we fix that is
48:51 - we say we need to say
48:52 - that this child should use um
48:56 - so flex yeah i should use flex one
49:00 - exactly
49:01 - yeah which which guys which what that
49:02 - does is that gives a basically like a
49:04 - weight
49:05 - i think if you think of a trade like a
49:06 - hierarchy right i think it like
49:08 - hierarchy what's more important
49:10 - it's going to give that input box a
49:13 - much higher importance value and a
49:15 - hierarchy value which will allow it to
49:17 - kind of grow
49:18 - and uh you know take up as much space as
49:20 - i can
49:21 - exactly yeah yeah uh yeah exactly so
49:24 - think of it as weights guys yeah so
49:26 - initially everything has like an equal
49:27 - weight but now if we say that the header
49:29 - search
49:30 - should have like more weight so let's
49:32 - say it's got flex
49:33 - one what this will do is like before i
49:35 - hit save on this
49:37 - notice how right now it's very difficult
49:38 - to see this but you see like
49:40 - um let me go ahead and point to it so
49:42 - you see like this right here
49:44 - like as soon as i hit save look what
49:45 - happens so i hit
49:47 - save and then i think we oh no oops i
49:49 - need to hit save properly one sec let's
49:51 - hit save
49:52 - and then you see like what actually
49:54 - happened was it did
49:55 - move over right because yes what has
49:57 - actually happened is
49:58 - right now there's like an invisible sort
50:01 - of like it's saying take up
50:02 - all of this space right now but it's
50:04 - just left the line because there's two
50:06 - children which is the input and this
50:09 - button
50:10 - right right right right right okay yeah
50:12 - yeah okay so we got the input we got the
50:15 - logos
50:15 - sure okay so we got that should we put
50:18 - in like a logo like a youtube logo to
50:19 - see how that's gonna start to look like
50:21 - yeah cause right now this looks horrible
50:24 - yeah
50:26 - images down yet yeah this is horrible
50:28 - right
50:29 - so guys what we can use is we can go
50:31 - ahead and use something called material
50:32 - ui
50:33 - icons right which is really cool so
50:34 - material ui icons
50:36 - um if we go here to icons and what we
50:39 - can do is to install it
50:40 - this is actually a really handy thing
50:42 - right so you can see they've got this
50:44 - search full list of icons if we go ahead
50:46 - and click that
50:47 - it will pull up the material ui icons
50:49 - like a little search panel what we can
50:50 - do is
50:51 - in the youtube search you see they've
50:52 - got this little uh
50:54 - nice sort of search hourglass right
50:57 - so if we go into material ui and we type
51:00 - in search
51:02 - there you go there we have it right
51:03 - there damn
51:05 - okay i like that okay let's do it if we
51:07 - click that it actually goes ahead and
51:08 - give us
51:09 - even gives us the code that we need
51:11 - which is dope i like that
51:12 - yeah so in order to get that usable what
51:15 - we need to do is we need to do npm
51:17 - install
51:17 - material ui icons like right here and
51:20 - then we go
51:20 - back to our code pull up the terminal
51:23 - and then we just need to run
51:24 - the following so i'm just trying to see
51:27 - because i don't think they can actually
51:28 - see the
51:29 - there we go so if i bring that tightly
51:31 - higher yeah
51:32 - there you go so now if i go ahead and do
51:34 - an installment to your ui icons
51:38 - that will actually go ahead and pull in
51:39 - the icons that we need
51:41 - um so that will actually go ahead and do
51:42 - what we want so you can see
51:44 - right now it's actually installing
51:46 - everything down here
51:48 - right there's not an
51:49 - [Laughter]
51:59 - right so i think at this point um while
52:02 - that's doing that uh let's go ahead and
52:04 - just carry on with the build so
52:06 - right now the header let's leave it
52:08 - there for a sec
52:10 - leave it there for a sec because this is
52:13 - more of a
52:14 - one second let's go ahead
52:17 - all right so we've got the header right
52:18 - and then we were saying the next step
52:20 - was to do
52:21 - oops the youtube logo is that we said
52:23 - youtube logo
52:24 - wait or are we finished
52:27 - like complete the header finishing up
52:29 - the complete header or what no no we can
52:30 - carry on yeah we can carry around yeah i
52:32 - was gonna roughly sort of draft it out
52:34 - you know like kind of have
52:35 - the sidebar in place and then okay let's
52:38 - do i actually i like that way better i
52:39 - like to basically just have a structure
52:41 - down and then we can put all the other
52:43 - all the other things down so yeah let's
52:44 - do that
52:45 - so we have the header and then we said
52:47 - next on the list was the to do so let's
52:49 - go ahead and check out
52:50 - it was the sidebar right so in order to
52:53 - get the sidebar
52:54 - up and going so what we now need to do
52:55 - is do this so let's go ahead and do
52:58 - so sidebar so this would be a sidebar
53:01 - component and now
53:02 - what we need to do in order to get a
53:03 - sidebar up is we go ahead create a new
53:06 - file
53:07 - and we call it sidebar.js
53:10 - nice rfce goes ahead and pulls
53:13 - everything in right so that's that
53:15 - little shortcut that we said
53:16 - and just to get just to prove that
53:18 - everything's nice
53:20 - um we need to go ahead and type in i um
53:23 - a sidebar like this
53:26 - like that right and then what we need to
53:27 - do is do if you remember click on the
53:30 - end of this
53:30 - do control spacebar and it says all i'll
53:33 - import from sidebar
53:34 - and you can actually sort of little
53:36 - trick there to sort everything going
53:39 - and now what you can see is you see like
53:41 - this is where we had everything before
53:42 - so you had the top part and then it just
53:44 - rendered in the sidebar right yeah yeah
53:47 - oops let's go ahead and yeah so rendered
53:48 - in the sidebar here
53:50 - nice so now what we want to do
53:53 - is i think sunny with the sidebar so if
53:56 - you have the sidebar so if you're
53:57 - looking at this right here you see
53:58 - you see what i'm doing here yeah right
54:00 - so if we have for example
54:01 - because since we're doing since we're
54:02 - doing the structure if we have a sidebar
54:04 - and let's say and i just kind of put
54:06 - this down
54:06 - uh and then we have the main right what
54:08 - do we want the
54:10 - main thing that's going to have the the
54:11 - actual youtube
54:13 - logos or youtube um thumbnails what
54:15 - should we call that
54:16 - um so you're talking about this part
54:19 - right
54:20 - let's go over back to the main part so
54:24 - all of this right yeah yeah like that
54:26 - yeah exactly
54:27 - what shall we call that for example
54:29 - let's call this
54:30 - um let's just call it the sort of
54:34 - should we call it videos container or
54:36 - something like that or video um
54:38 - um yeah i mean we can yeah we can call
54:40 - it like
54:41 - we can call like a video container
54:43 - sidebar or we can call like main
54:45 - container as well let's just call it
54:46 - main container for now so
54:47 - when we refer to the main container guys
54:49 - we're talking about this right here
54:51 - so this entire sort of container right
54:54 - yeah
54:54 - yeah yeah but yeah yeah exactly but the
54:57 - reason why like
54:58 - i was i kind of break this down so if
54:59 - you go back to the code for example
55:01 - right if you go back um so with this
55:04 - right i feel like i
55:06 - think what's going to happen is because
55:07 - we have the sidebar on the left
55:09 - and the main container on the right you
55:11 - almost have to wrap these in the div
55:12 - right
55:13 - almost kind of like in a div right
55:14 - because then well let me remove that
55:17 - because that is what will allow us to
55:19 - have like a sidebar
55:20 - yeah right and a main container be next
55:24 - to each other right
55:25 - yeah correct okay okay exactly yeah so
55:28 - it's a really good point that now i said
55:29 - guys
55:30 - when you want to have this remember by
55:32 - default this is going to have um
55:34 - this is going to have display type block
55:36 - which means it's going to basically put
55:37 - things
55:38 - on top of each other but what we
55:40 - actually need
55:41 - is we need it to look like we need the
55:43 - logo on the sort of side
55:44 - the the header at the top but then we
55:46 - need the sidebar on the left
55:48 - and then the main container on the right
55:50 - right right
55:51 - just how they have it in youtube so
55:53 - right now like you can see the header is
55:54 - always at the top
55:55 - and then you have this sidebar on the
55:57 - left and then you have everything
55:59 - on the right so if nars is right um yeah
56:02 - so we need to wrap that
56:04 - so it's really good point there um okay
56:06 - so what we can do is we can go ahead and
56:08 - apply some bem here so we can say app
56:09 - oops class name
56:11 - and we can say class name equals app
56:14 - underscore the scopes
56:16 - and here let's just call this one um
56:19 - [Music]
56:21 - naming is always the hardest thing in
56:22 - development yeah and this is what i mean
56:24 - like this is where
56:25 - they see the actual live you know
56:30 - yeah so we've got app and then we've got
56:32 - app but let's just call it let's just
56:33 - say
56:33 - the um page so the rest of the page
56:36 - right
56:37 - this will be the header and this will be
56:38 - the rest of the page like you can you
56:40 - can say like home page because we'll
56:41 - have like a different page later on
56:43 - right which is going to have like um
56:44 - right you could save the whole page like
56:45 - for example yeah yeah yeah
56:48 - oh yeah but uh we'll introduce react
56:50 - router to get that done
56:52 - oh okay okay okay i gotcha gotcha okay
56:54 - nice and we'll see how we'll see how
56:56 - the build goes up to the first page
56:58 - point and if it's enough
56:59 - like for like you know like we'll see
57:00 - how we go on with that yeah yeah
57:02 - yeah sure that so now we've got the app
57:05 - page
57:06 - here and basically to so like what nas
57:09 - mentioned earlier so it says main
57:10 - container is not defined oh yeah
57:12 - this one here so for now i'm just going
57:14 - to go ahead and
57:15 - point out so like right now you can see
57:17 - like um actually
57:18 - let's go ahead and build that container
57:19 - because we're actually going to need
57:20 - that right
57:21 - yeah yep so let's go ahead and add that
57:23 - so go here
57:24 - close this file oops you can save that
57:28 - we need to go ahead and let me make this
57:30 - visible need to go ahead and create a
57:32 - file and call it the main
57:34 - container yes and we do a little trick
57:38 - rfce boom and then here guys remember
57:41 - like just say like h1
57:43 - here is where the videos goes here's
57:45 - where videos go
57:47 - nice something like that right yeah and
57:51 - inside of the apps let's go open up our
57:54 - app
57:55 - so now you can see like we have the main
57:57 - container remember we need to pull that
57:58 - in otherwise it's going to freak out so
57:59 - if you open up your
58:01 - uh terminals let me go ahead and close
58:03 - this one so you can see like even your
58:04 - terminal is going to give you all of
58:06 - this stuff so like if you're if you're
58:07 - not
58:07 - always like say you've got a small
58:09 - screen and you don't want to keep doing
58:10 - back and forth
58:11 - you can actually use your terminals
58:12 - you're sort of like place of uh sort of
58:14 - knowing where an error is and things
58:16 - like that so we do this
58:18 - and sometimes it doesn't work that trick
58:20 - you need to do something like import
58:22 - main container from main container
58:27 - and then that works and now
58:30 - let's see there we go so i'm a sidebar
58:32 - here's where the side videos go
58:34 - so let's make it easier so let's go
58:35 - ahead and get rid of the that so it's
58:37 - not as confusing
58:39 - and now you can see guys we've got the
58:40 - header at the top right
58:42 - and then we have i am a sidebar and we
58:44 - have this is where
58:46 - uh let me bring that in a bit yeah here
58:48 - is where the videos go right
58:50 - so now is what what's the next step
58:52 - right now so like right now these are
58:54 - block
58:54 - how do we get yeah to look the way we
58:56 - need it
58:58 - so so guys so if we have down you can
59:00 - see that i'm a sidebar and then here's
59:02 - where the videos go right
59:04 - they are kind of on top of each other so
59:06 - what we want to do
59:07 - is we want to bring into to the left and
59:09 - to the right hand of each other so
59:10 - we want them to be basically next to
59:13 - each other just like how we have it on
59:14 - the youtube page right
59:16 - sidebar on the left you know the main
59:17 - pages on the right so
59:19 - what we the next step is to convert that
59:22 - from where being on top of each other to
59:24 - be into the left and to the right hand
59:26 - side of each other
59:27 - and what we can use for that as i'm sure
59:29 - you guys you all know what can we use
59:31 - for that drop that in the comments below
59:33 - but we can use for that something called
59:35 - display flex
59:36 - and if we try that out that should be
59:38 - the thing to fix it
59:39 - awesome exactly that so flex is your
59:42 - best friend guys
59:44 - like here what we can do is we can go
59:45 - ahead and target it and we can say that
59:47 - container
59:48 - should have display flex ben deloila
59:51 - ben de loyola says flex again yep we're
59:54 - going to see a lot of flex
59:56 - so display flex and as soon as what i'm
59:58 - going to do here is i'm going to do that
59:59 - little neat trick so we can see it in
60:00 - action before i save it
60:02 - so just as i save it now what we should
60:05 - see is it goes from a display block so
60:07 - this and this
60:08 - it should snap to the side of each other
60:10 - right so as soon as i hit save
60:12 - there you go nice nice nice nice nice
60:15 - nice
60:16 - awesome and what we can do here is what
60:18 - i like to do here is actually like
60:20 - whenever you have like a sidebar or
60:22 - something like that let's just go back
60:23 - to the code
60:24 - so whenever you have like a sidebar or
60:26 - something so
60:28 - like firstly let's create the
60:29 - corresponding sort of css files
60:31 - because we want our sidebar to have some
60:33 - styling so let's go ahead and do
60:35 - sidebar.css
60:36 - and let's go ahead and do
60:40 - maincontainer.css
60:42 - and remember you need to import these
60:43 - into the components guys so i see a lot
60:45 - of people actually make that mistake
60:46 - when they're learning that why is my css
60:48 - not being applied
60:49 - it's because you're most likely not
60:51 - pulling it in at this point
60:53 - i made this mistake a bunch when i was
60:55 - learning so i wouldn't actually i'd
60:56 - forget to write this
60:57 - and um yeah and then you you're writing
61:00 - all sorts of css rules in here and then
61:01 - you're freaking out as to why
61:03 - they're not being used uh that's most
61:05 - likely the reason
61:08 - nice can you believe it my command key
61:10 - is actually chipping away now
61:12 - but i mean chipping away like you can't
61:14 - use it anymore no no then the actual
61:16 - text on my command key is actually
61:17 - slowly chipping away
61:18 - oh man it's aggressive coding right
61:22 - why you so being being so aggressive
61:24 - with it huh i know right it's like
61:25 - slowly dripping away so sad
61:28 - come on come on come on need to get
61:31 - there man do it
61:33 - right so we have the sidebar there you
61:35 - go we have the sidebar and now what we
61:37 - can do is
61:38 - and if you guys are wondering how i keep
61:39 - pulling up this shortcut right here it's
61:41 - just command p
61:42 - and you can actually go ahead and type
61:43 - in stuff and then you bring up your file
61:45 - really nice way of like speeding up your
61:46 - workflow yeah it's nice we have the sort
61:49 - of main container and we have the
61:50 - sidebar and this is where you want to
61:51 - get to like a high level overview
61:53 - of everything yeah um so now what i like
61:56 - to do
61:56 - usually is actually sort of draw like an
61:58 - imaginary border around everything
62:00 - so you can kind of see like from the
62:02 - get-go what it all looks like right
62:04 - so the sidebar what we got what we can
62:07 - go ahead and do is we can go ahead and
62:08 - say
62:09 - um so this div we need to say class name
62:12 - is
62:13 - sidebar and we also want the main
62:16 - container
62:17 - to have its own class name of main
62:20 - container
62:21 - like that and then what we can say is
62:24 - main container
62:27 - can have a border of one pixel solid
62:30 - black
62:31 - right and what i'm going to do is i'm
62:33 - going to click save and you should see
62:35 - it pop in here so now you see that it
62:38 - just popped in there
62:38 - it's black border right okay okay so
62:40 - we're going to do is we're going to go
62:41 - to sidebar.css and do the same thing
62:43 - we'll say sidebar
62:45 - i'm going to say one pixel oops border
62:48 - one pixel solid black and then as soon
62:51 - as i hit
62:52 - save we'll see that there we go
62:55 - nice nice it's always a nice way to do
62:58 - that because then what you can actually
62:59 - go ahead and do now is actually do
63:00 - what nars talked about earlier which is
63:02 - that sort of weighing you know that
63:03 - where you have determined the weights of
63:05 - things
63:06 - right yeah so like if we look at the
63:08 - actual youtube app we can notice that
63:10 - like the sort of split here
63:12 - is like what would you say the split is
63:13 - here like between the sidebar
63:16 - as opposed to the rest of the app so
63:18 - like i would say
63:20 - it's like 20 yeah it's like 20 right and
63:22 - then all of that stuff
63:24 - kind of gets like about 80
63:27 - right yeah we want this side to have
63:29 - like 80
63:31 - and this side to have 20 so the sidebar
63:34 - should have 20 percent
63:35 - and the uh and and the main content
63:38 - should have
63:39 - 80 percent right but in order to get to
63:42 - that point what we want to do
63:44 - is go ahead and do what we talked about
63:46 - earlier which is in the weighings
63:48 - so would that be hinos
63:53 - so to weigh it yeah yeah uh well
63:56 - actually
63:56 - what guys would it be here would we
63:58 - would we set the weight
64:00 - inside the class name app page or where
64:02 - we do that
64:03 - yeah five seconds five four three two
64:06 - one
64:07 - [Laughter]
64:10 - well yeah this will be and on the
64:12 - sidebar and the main container so if we
64:13 - go ahead
64:14 - if we actually go to the sidebar um and
64:17 - we will go to the sidebar css right
64:19 - um yeah the sidebar one right
64:23 - right is this oh yeah yeah of course
64:25 - you're right yeah it'll be on the side
64:26 - but it'll be in the child guys
64:28 - exactly exactly so if you go to the
64:30 - sidebar css
64:31 - then what we need to do is we just set
64:34 - the flex for the side
64:35 - sidebar we need to set the flex for that
64:36 - to be what yep so here
64:39 - remember we previously gave the search
64:41 - bar one because we said take up as much
64:43 - room as you want yeah but in this case
64:45 - and guys just so you know the value here
64:47 - is between zero
64:48 - and one so like you choose a value
64:49 - between zero and one
64:51 - so uh in this case we said 20 right
64:54 - which is
64:55 - 0.2 0.2 okay beautiful
64:58 - and as soon as we hit save on that we
65:00 - should see i'm not sure if we'll see
65:01 - actually much
65:02 - difference here but we can actually go
65:04 - ahead and try so if i do 0.2 now
65:06 - you can here okay yeah so you used up
65:08 - 20. so nice
65:10 - right yeah and then and then the other
65:12 - one which is the where the videos go
65:13 - the other one which is the main
65:14 - container right that one
65:17 - is going to be zero point guys what zero
65:20 - point eight i mean you
65:20 - you should know that oh wait actually i
65:21 - just told you the answer never mind
65:25 - i'm like wait hold on i just tell you
65:27 - the answer
65:29 - 0.8 exactly so
65:32 - before i hit save so let's go and have a
65:34 - look and as soon as i hit save
65:36 - boom nice nice beautiful
65:39 - and what we can actually do guys is what
65:41 - can we do now what do you think
65:42 - because what can we do so because we can
65:45 - kind of have it right now where it's
65:46 - like
65:47 - in a very like you know roll cut type
65:49 - level
65:50 - how can we make the sidebar and then
65:52 - where the videos go actually be a full
65:54 - screen almost
65:55 - like what can we do about that what do
65:56 - you think sunny so i think we can use
65:59 - um we can set the height of it right we
66:02 - can set that okay
66:03 - to be using i actually always run into
66:05 - this issue i mean i always do this so i
66:07 - would say like something like
66:08 - height um and then i'll do i think it's
66:11 - like a hundred
66:11 - is it view height or is it a hundred
66:13 - percent you can do vh you can do vh but
66:16 - that's gonna basically that's gonna
66:17 - actually
66:18 - create because it's below the navigation
66:21 - bar
66:21 - that that is going to create basically
66:23 - like um a scrollable so actually do vh
66:26 - right now do vh and you'll see what i
66:27 - mean
66:27 - do vh as soon as i hit save watch what
66:29 - happens guys
66:30 - so there you go but you see it scrolls
66:32 - down because that we're not accounting
66:34 - for
66:35 - this topic so we're saying 100 of the
66:37 - view height but then
66:38 - the view height is actually there you
66:39 - see that so it goes over
66:41 - right yeah so the only way the only way
66:43 - for us to fix that the only way for us
66:45 - to fix that so check this out can i can
66:46 - i take i'm gonna take over here so
66:48 - some uh coding here for a second okay go
66:50 - for it um so if we go ahead and if we go
66:52 - to app.js right which are you on
66:54 - the gs yeah let me yeah so app suggests
66:59 - yeah so follow follow me here for a
67:01 - second okay
67:03 - if you can yep i'm following you now
67:06 - beautiful so for an app.js right in
67:09 - order for us to basically have a where
67:11 - you know
67:12 - where the whole thing is vertical you
67:14 - know 100 percent
67:15 - we have to go all the way to the parent
67:17 - container which is what which is
67:19 - the app right so if we go to our app the
67:21 - css and we set the app
67:23 - we're going to say hey hey the app right
67:25 - that's going to be our
67:27 - app yep the app hey the app let's make
67:30 - that
67:31 - to be a height of you know 100 vh
67:34 - okay 100 vh okay right so that's going
67:37 - to be a
67:38 - height of 100 vh that's going to make
67:39 - the whole app
67:43 - and so then at that point what's going
67:44 - to happen so that's going to now
67:46 - make the whole app vertical height 100
67:47 - which is good all right
67:49 - and then yeah yeah yeah dude
67:53 - yeah yeah so now you make some now the
67:55 - header okay that's going to be your flex
67:57 - item
67:57 - and then this item is also going to be
67:59 - your also flex item
68:00 - so if we have the headers just and
68:02 - that's just being at the top you know
68:04 - that's just at the top
68:05 - okay what can we do to this to take up
68:08 - the rest of the space
68:12 - what can we do here so
68:15 - the header and the header is at the top
68:17 - correct yep right that's going to take
68:18 - up as much space as it wants to
68:20 - this other container though we want this
68:22 - to take up the the rest of the space so
68:24 - what do we do
68:25 - we could do a height of a hundred
68:26 - percent
68:28 - well no but we're using flex remember
68:31 - we're using flex
68:32 - okay so here app yeah
68:35 - i'm gonna say display next i'm gonna say
68:37 - display flags here on the app okay
68:38 - so let's play flex okay yeah right and
68:41 - i'm gonna say what i'm gonna say flex
68:42 - direction
68:43 - and then we can reaction column right
68:46 - because that's gonna be stacked column
68:47 - now okay
68:48 - yeah good so i'm gonna save that i'm
68:50 - gonna save that now i'll go back to
68:52 - app.js
68:53 - now the header this is fine div class
68:55 - app this is fine let's actually go back
68:57 - to um the main container and remove that
68:59 - 100 vh
69:00 - for a second here okay let's go to main
69:01 - computer css
69:03 - yup actually where did you put the 100
69:05 - vh on which side was it
69:09 - app sidebar we put a sidebar height of
69:12 - 100 v8 yeah
69:14 - right there right there so let's run it
69:15 - for here for a second just just for a
69:16 - second here okay
69:17 - okay i'm gonna save that here and then
69:20 - let's go back to
69:21 - um app.js okay okay
69:26 - and what we're gonna do now is we're
69:27 - gonna set this app page
69:29 - this app page to be a to be what to be
69:32 - what flex what
69:34 - we'll set out to be uh so what do we say
69:38 - to
69:38 - one to use up the rest of the space
69:40 - right exactly exactly to
69:42 - one right okay so flex
69:46 - one nice okay now check this out so
69:49 - let's go ahead and save this
69:50 - let's go take let's go ahead and take a
69:52 - look at what we actually get cool man i
69:54 - didn't oh
69:55 - because i always run into this issue as
69:56 - well refresh it did it yes or no
69:59 - refresh it on my main screen is actually
70:01 - taking effect but on this screen it's
70:03 - not so
70:04 - on my big screen is this so you see we
70:06 - can't actually scroll
70:07 - right yeah there you go and so now it's
70:08 - fully 100 100 vertical height and you
70:11 - know and it's going to take as much
70:12 - space as it wants to and it's going to
70:13 - be very dynamic
70:14 - that's the really cool part about it
70:16 - nice okay i mean on the smaller screen
70:18 - i'm not sure maybe this one's not
70:19 - caching or something but if you can just
70:22 - refresh it
70:23 - yeah if you check on your oh there we go
70:25 - yeah so it was caching there you go
70:26 - yeah there you go you see that guys like
70:28 - it's actually now no longer scrolling
70:30 - because
70:31 - we said the entire container has a view
70:34 - that's so cool nice i didn't actually
70:35 - know that
70:36 - i actually yeah yeah yeah like um i
70:38 - actually end up like doing sort of a
70:39 - flex sort of hacky way of doing that but
70:41 - that's that's a really clean way of
70:42 - doing that yeah
70:44 - yeah you you have to start flex from all
70:46 - the way to the top of the page
70:48 - when you do that when you start with
70:49 - losing flash from top of the page then
70:51 - everything can trickle down very easily
70:53 - oh nice that's actually saved me a bunch
70:55 - of headaches guys if you found that
70:57 - useful as well smash
70:58 - the thumbs up button because that was
70:59 - actually new for me as well that was
71:01 - nice okay awesome so now we have a very
71:04 - nice sort of layout so this is looking
71:05 - sort of much more
71:07 - um closer to sort of the youtube like
71:10 - obviously the design's a bit different
71:14 - but it looks like it's getting there you
71:15 - know it's somewhat getting there
71:17 - right so now let's go ahead and create
71:20 - the cards
71:20 - i guess right
71:24 - okay we can create the card yeah we can
71:25 - get the cards here that's fine
71:27 - but okay okay yeah i should like yeah
71:29 - let's do that i agree with you there
71:30 - yeah i'll do that
71:31 - so some kind of caught outline at least
71:34 - oh god awesome no don't go into that
71:38 - yeah
71:40 - thank god it popped up on a different
71:41 - screen right
71:43 - right so now what we're going to do is
71:45 - we are going to go ahead and
71:46 - do um right so the cards right so the
71:50 - cards are in the main container
71:51 - so we go inside here this is where the
71:53 - videos go so basically what we want to
71:55 - do is
71:56 - um can you notice how inside of this
71:59 - right here so i mean we could do this
72:01 - two ways right we can actually have it
72:02 - so it could be like flex
72:03 - wrap and it would kind of just like the
72:05 - card components would get stacked up so
72:07 - imagine we
72:08 - what we want to do here guys is kind of
72:09 - draw so i'll just draw it out so like
72:11 - imagine we had one of those cards here
72:13 - another card here
72:14 - another card here and basically what we
72:17 - could do here is we could basically have
72:18 - it so that if there's enough room for
72:19 - another one
72:20 - it would just show it here or we could
72:22 - do it as fixed what do you think knows
72:24 - i would say i would say let's keep it to
72:26 - like three like or how much does youtube
72:28 - have in terms of like uh
72:30 - so usually i mean so let's do four let's
72:33 - just keep it at four
72:34 - let's just keep it so we won't okay
72:37 - let's do four yep
72:38 - so let's do that so so now what we can
72:41 - go ahead and do
72:42 - is let's go ahead and actually make a
72:44 - component for this we could say
72:46 - should we call it like the so this is
72:48 - actually sort of is it's a sort of
72:50 - thumbnail
72:51 - i guess but it's not just a thumbnail
72:52 - it's the entire sort of card should we
72:55 - call it like a video card
72:56 - maybe yeah let's do that i like that i
72:58 - like that i like that let's do a video
72:59 - card yeah
73:00 - video card something like this right so
73:02 - video card
73:04 - yeah we go inside of our files and we
73:06 - can go ahead and do something like this
73:07 - video
73:08 - card.js and remember guys what you want
73:10 - to do is i'll just make this a bit
73:12 - clearer so we do rfce
73:14 - and then boom we get the video card and
73:16 - then remember guys so
73:18 - i like to sort of like roughly
73:21 - address sort of like what it would look
73:23 - like inside of the code here so
73:25 - if we look at the youtube app we have a
73:27 - thumbnail so we have the sort of the
73:29 - image itself so we have this
73:31 - right here the image then we have like a
73:33 - title
73:34 - then we have the sort of um the channel
73:37 - name
73:38 - and then we have how many people are
73:39 - watching and then we have we can ignore
73:41 - the live now because
73:42 - this isn't on every single one so we
73:44 - just kind of want to want this as the
73:45 - bare minimum and we also got on the left
73:47 - side
73:48 - you see we've also got an image here
73:50 - [Music]
73:51 - right so we've also got images so
73:53 - there's a bunch of things there's a one
73:54 - two three four
73:55 - five different things right right so if
73:58 - we want to go ahead and put this inside
73:59 - of our
74:00 - app what we can kind of do is we can we
74:02 - can think of this as being the props
74:03 - because we're going to pass these in as
74:04 - props so we can destructure at that
74:07 - point
74:08 - and we can say right it's going to have
74:09 - a thumbnail
74:11 - url right
74:15 - is for the picture it's going to have a
74:16 - title it's going to have
74:18 - a channel name so like a channel name
74:22 - a number of views so like number of
74:25 - views
74:27 - and then what else hold on let me see
74:29 - and we also had like the i guess it was
74:31 - like the
74:32 - the the the channel your that channel
74:35 - image url
74:36 - or something
74:39 - you see yeah yeah channel you could just
74:41 - say channel image
74:42 - right yeah channel imagery that makes
74:44 - sense and then and then
74:46 - another thing is like i know if we want
74:47 - to put that in but i was gonna say
74:50 - it's gonna be like when it was actually
74:52 - posted
74:54 - uh like four years ago two years ago
74:58 - yeah yeah so in this case should we do
75:00 - it as a string maybe
75:02 - yeah yeah uh well it's probably just
75:04 - gonna honestly it's probably going to be
75:05 - a date the way i see it might just be
75:07 - um for easier for easiest use
75:11 - for easiest use it might just yeah let's
75:13 - just keep it as a string for easiest
75:14 - using
75:15 - yeah yeah when we do the full youtube
75:17 - clone what we'll do is we'll actually go
75:18 - ahead and do it as a date and then it
75:20 - will actually determine yeah based on
75:21 - that date
75:22 - how many months back and we can have a
75:24 - database and stuff behind it
75:25 - but for now what we can say is maybe
75:27 - like posted
75:29 - uh yeah posted date
75:32 - yeah just put yeah like date and we'll
75:34 - just keep it as a string for now
75:35 - yeah so today right so then that's cool
75:38 - and now what we can do is guys what i
75:40 - actually like to do here is you can
75:42 - actually go ahead and give it like some
75:43 - uh actually
75:44 - we won't do that i mean you could give
75:45 - it some default
75:47 - no let's not do that because it might
75:48 - confuse people okay so we've got the
75:50 - video card here and let's go ahead and
75:52 - give it a class name for the parent so
75:55 - this one could be called just video card
75:57 - to go with bam and guys if you're
75:59 - wondering what i'm doing the bem is the
76:00 - naming convention
76:02 - that we're following for css right so
76:04 - just in case you're wondering
76:06 - it's something which i recommend
76:07 - everyone sort of learns because it's
76:08 - really handy especially when you're
76:09 - doing sort of component based work
76:11 - um nice but then what we need to do is
76:13 - go ahead and create the video card
76:15 - video card mm-hmm video card dot css
76:19 - like this right mm-hmm that nice
76:22 - and now what we can do is let's go ahead
76:26 - and go to uh we need to import this file
76:30 - so
76:32 - import
76:36 - video card dot css like that
76:40 - right nice um
76:43 - okay cool so with that done what we can
76:46 - now
76:46 - go ahead and say is remember guys that
76:49 - what we were doing before
76:51 - was just kind of drawing like these
76:52 - imaginary borders around everything and
76:54 - it kind of makes life a bit easier when
76:55 - you're sort of
76:56 - figuring out what everything looks like
76:58 - so in this case i'll do the same i'll
76:59 - say video card
77:01 - should have a border of a one pixel
77:03 - solid black
77:06 - all right nice okay and then like
77:08 - obviously nothing's rendering here
77:09 - because we actually have we're not
77:10 - actually pulling it in so if we go to
77:12 - our main container
77:14 - we actually sort of import the video
77:16 - card so you see like
77:17 - actually if i do that control spacebar
77:19 - trick it just auto imports which is
77:20 - really nice
77:22 - save it and now if we go back
77:25 - you can see okay so there is a con there
77:27 - is something there with a border black
77:29 - but it's just
77:30 - like oh it's just really small
77:33 - yeah so right now if we actually go to
77:34 - the video card there's it's just an
77:36 - empty div which is why it looks like a
77:38 - line
77:38 - mm-hmm right but what we could do is we
77:40 - could hit we could go ahead and say like
77:42 - give it give it like give it like a
77:44 - height maybe no just give like or any
77:45 - height or okay
77:46 - if you put something in you could just
77:47 - say like uh yeah yeah a video card
77:51 - i um a video card like this
77:55 - so i'm a video card right this is the
77:58 - beauty of sort of the using components
77:59 - guys it's like now like if you just do
78:01 - like
78:02 - a bunch of video cards you can see like
78:04 - i'm a video card i'm a video i'm pretty
78:06 - good
78:06 - right so now we're gonna get this to
78:09 - look
78:10 - something like this right
78:13 - there's something along that so
78:14 - obviously it looks like a long way off
78:16 - but we'll get there
78:20 - very long way off yeah it looks it looks
78:23 - really far away but we'll get that
78:25 - the reason why i was thinking maybe do a
78:26 - flex wrap is because when we do
78:28 - um but then i guess we want it to look
78:31 - like the youtube app
78:32 - right so yeah i mean i mean look i mean
78:34 - i i think when we get to like using that
78:36 - yeah
78:36 - we can do like flagstrap that's fine
78:37 - like when we get to actually yeah that
78:39 - should be fine yeah
78:40 - yeah yeah so now we can say is
78:44 - um okay so we've got this is where the
78:47 - videos go
78:48 - video card okay well first of all so we
78:50 - got the video card right so
78:52 - we got the video card but it's currently
78:54 - like in a column fashion should we
78:55 - change that to go back to like a roll
78:57 - fashion
78:58 - yeah so that it's like one after the one
78:59 - one to the other let's do that
79:01 - yeah let's do that um so i guess like in
79:04 - this case
79:05 - are we gonna manually just say that
79:07 - there's going to be a
79:08 - row and then we'll say a second row a
79:10 - third row or how should we do that
79:12 - um so okay so this is this is actually
79:14 - interesting so actually i've kind of
79:15 - done that
79:16 - so okay so this can be a little bit like
79:19 - you do not have to specify a row yeah
79:23 - you just simply specify you spin simply
79:25 - specify
79:26 - um the flex number like zero for example
79:29 - if you want
79:30 - four items right and four items in one
79:34 - row you say you set a flex
79:36 - um you said a flex of wait what is one
79:39 - divided by four
79:40 - 100 divided by four that's 25 right yes
79:44 - yeah so you you said flex 9.25 to every
79:46 - single item
79:48 - nice yes okay and then you can change it
79:51 - actually and you can change that
79:52 - uh and then what you can actually see
79:54 - there's another thing you can use but
79:56 - there's nothing you can use to actually
79:57 - very nicely evenly space them but we'll
79:59 - talk about that later
80:00 - later in a second here oh okay i see
80:02 - what you're doing here yeah
80:04 - yeah nice so what we do is we're going
80:05 - to main container guys and we basically
80:07 - want to make this main container
80:09 - have that display flex right so
80:13 - that's going to have display flex and as
80:14 - soon as i hit save
80:16 - notice what happens so let's go over to
80:17 - this screen and we do this and as soon
80:19 - as i hit save
80:20 - it's going to go all into a row oh oops
80:22 - hit save on that one
80:24 - nope yeah and you see it goes into a row
80:27 - right nice
80:28 - nice so the first thing i want to do is
80:29 - actually go ahead and get rid of the
80:31 - this h1 because that's a bit confusing
80:34 - so
80:34 - now we actually have i'm a video card
80:36 - i'm a video kind of a video card
80:38 - now yeah as you mentioned like each of
80:40 - the children right so each of those
80:41 - video cards
80:42 - if we gave them 0.25 then it should
80:46 - thicken up like 25 of that main
80:48 - container right
80:49 - exactly exactly exactly so if we go over
80:51 - to that video kind of we say flex
80:53 - of 0.25 and guys this is insane because
80:57 - like once you get used to flexbox like
80:59 - one rule
81:00 - actually does all the layout for you
81:02 - know it solves all the
81:03 - headache of getting everything so i can
81:04 - see some people saying use calculate
81:07 - size and number of elements don't do any
81:09 - of that that's like an old-school way of
81:10 - doing it
81:11 - flex handles all this for you so like if
81:14 - i as soon as i hit save watch what
81:15 - happens so
81:16 - this is applying the flex 0.25 so as
81:19 - soon as i hit save
81:21 - nice right nice nice nice 9.25
81:24 - and then and then we can average and now
81:26 - let's say we can make this
81:28 - um i don't know i forgot what it is but
81:30 - what i think so we got the 9.25 now we
81:33 - want to do is
81:34 - you see how the height of it is like a
81:35 - hundred percent yeah we want to
81:37 - we want to stop it from we want to stop
81:40 - that from
81:42 - um basically you know extending all the
81:44 - way to the bottom
81:45 - yeah we want to just keep it to it it's
81:48 - normal height
81:49 - yeah so how do we do that so you can do
81:52 - a
81:52 - max height right you can do a max height
81:56 - yeah you can do a max fight
81:57 - true wha what other way were you
81:59 - thinking maybe
82:00 - uh well i mean i was thinking max i was
82:03 - asking you oh okay
82:06 - so you see here guys the way i like to
82:08 - sort of roughly figure it out right
82:10 - is i'll go here and inspect it and i can
82:12 - see like there's got a height of i think
82:14 - that's
82:14 - i can't is it a height in width or is it
82:16 - width tonight i think but it's roughly
82:17 - around 260 right
82:19 - so 260 is roughly sort of the height
82:21 - there so what we could do is we can
82:23 - go ahead and actually say like a max
82:24 - height of 260. um and what
82:27 - we can do is we get a rough sort of idea
82:29 - of the video card so if we go into the
82:30 - video column we say
82:31 - set a max height of like 250 pixels
82:35 - and then i hit save let's go back to the
82:38 - you can see as soon as i hit save boom
82:41 - there you go
82:42 - nice nice nice nice nice and okay
82:45 - okay great so actually actually another
82:47 - way you can actually do that
82:49 - um to prevent the height if you actually
82:51 - even remove the height
82:52 - if you set at the parent to be a line
82:55 - item for example like center like if you
82:57 - do a line item center on the parent
83:00 - it should not basically like the height
83:02 - would like
83:03 - basically the high would would stay to
83:06 - its normal position
83:07 - to to fit the content so you mean
83:11 - okay so what we're saying is apparent so
83:13 - here main container
83:15 - okay yeah yeah if you go to make it if
83:17 - you said for example align
83:19 - items right and you set that to be for
83:20 - example like center right
83:22 - yeah so as soon as i hit or let's yeah
83:25 - or let's say align items um
83:27 - top flex start right
83:31 - flex start yeah so as soon as i do yeah
83:34 - okay okay okay you see
83:37 - so now the height of those cards are
83:40 - only the height of the actual content
83:42 - i did not know that as well okay nice
83:46 - i'm learning
83:49 - it's actually good stuff like it's a
83:51 - flex master class
83:53 - all right nice
83:54 - [Laughter]
83:58 - so here we go this is the best part guys
84:00 - like about like learning together
84:02 - is i get to learn a lot of stuff from
84:03 - sunny sunny gets to learn from me
84:05 - like it's like this is the like when you
84:07 - have such amazing team guys
84:09 - of you know people are just doing things
84:12 - people creating
84:12 - things you just get to learn a lot from
84:14 - each other you get each other's energy
84:16 - it is
84:17 - beyond epic like i'd say i just want to
84:19 - mention that it's just it's so awesome
84:21 - exactly guys like it's all about like
84:23 - finding like amazing team and like even
84:25 - pair programming like what we're doing
84:26 - right now
84:27 - like that's the way you really learn and
84:29 - like you kind of accelerate your growth
84:31 - as a developer
84:31 - so definitely worth doing and definitely
84:34 - use vs code live share like me and us
84:35 - doing right now
84:36 - yeah yeah yeah so now let's go ahead and
84:40 - let's go ahead and actually sort of put
84:42 - in like a dummy i guess right so we'll
84:44 - have something like
84:45 - it's like an image here and then the
84:47 - image source would be the thumbnail url
84:50 - right so let's go ahead and put the
84:51 - thumbnail url and then we'll have a
84:54 - um so remember guys like the actual
84:56 - layout of everything so in this case you
84:58 - had like the
85:00 - the uh image at the top and then you had
85:02 - like everything so imagine this is kind
85:04 - of like two containers right
85:05 - mm-hmm we have one here and then we have
85:08 - this one underneath it
85:09 - right right containers so we can go
85:11 - ahead and separate that
85:13 - now at this point so we can go ahead and
85:14 - say um
85:16 - we could say video card so div i mean
85:19 - like we could just have the image as the
85:21 - top element
85:22 - and then the bottom one inside of its
85:24 - own containers we could say
85:26 - video card info something or video card
85:29 - yeah video just say like video card info
85:30 - yeah that's
85:31 - that's fine yeah yeah and then that way
85:33 - guys everything underneath there
85:35 - so this is actually sort of two children
85:37 - now so if we actually minimize this you
85:39 - can see like it's actually
85:40 - two children so like this is the parent
85:42 - and then we've got one
85:43 - child two child and then video card we
85:46 - can give it a type
85:48 - of um display flex
85:51 - and what i like to do here is to make
85:52 - sure that it uses up the correct sort of
85:54 - spacing as a flex direction column
85:57 - and then i think it will give it if you
85:58 - gave flex direction column
86:00 - you can go ahead and do 50 0.5 0.5 in it
86:03 - because you see
86:05 - should we do it that way or should we
86:06 - just do it as we need it
86:09 - um let's do it as we need it because
86:11 - yeah yeah let's do it as we need it
86:13 - because that might be
86:13 - unnecessary right now so yeah go back
86:16 - here and you can see okay it's a video
86:17 - card info
86:18 - right okay so and now we have the image
86:21 - there and then
86:22 - in here in the video called info so now
86:24 - guys this is another question so
86:26 - you can see now over here we actually
86:29 - have sort of all of this information so
86:31 - all of this information
86:33 - in one sort of container and then we
86:35 - have this thumbnail
86:36 - on the left or like this sort of icon
86:38 - over there on the left
86:39 - yeah right yeah and the reason guys the
86:42 - reason the reason why we see that right
86:44 - is because
86:44 - you know we see things in rows and
86:46 - columns right if you look at for example
86:48 - you know
86:49 - if you look at for example the the
86:51 - thumbnail that is a column
86:53 - to the right of the thumbnail right
86:54 - where all the text is that's another
86:56 - column
86:57 - right so you'll be but that's how you
86:59 - know as kind of sunny is highlighting
87:01 - it's two different columns
87:02 - and then within those columns you have
87:05 - different rows and then more columns
87:07 - right but the way that the way that we
87:09 - see when when we look at these things in
87:11 - terms of structure
87:12 - we always like to see them in terms of
87:13 - rows and columns because that is how the
87:14 - web is built guys okay
87:16 - exactly the web is just a bunch of
87:17 - rectangles that's all i can say
87:19 - literally that
87:19 - exactly that yeah like and then if you
87:22 - give it the correct flex rules it kind
87:24 - of figures out all the spacing itself
87:26 - yeah exactly exactly yeah so here what
87:29 - we can do is so you can see it's like a
87:31 - container with two sides so we're going
87:32 - to have like the icon and then
87:33 - here's going to be like the info sort of
87:35 - text i guess
87:37 - so yeah you know as we go back to our
87:39 - code and now we can see like we've got
87:41 - here oops
87:42 - we're doing that so i can say here we
87:44 - can say let's create a div
87:46 - and let's have let's have on the left
87:47 - side we can have an image
87:49 - so this image would be the sort of
87:51 - channel
87:53 - image url
87:56 - and on the right side we say div video
87:58 - card so video card and then bem
88:00 - so the element we're talking about is
88:01 - info text so that'll be all the other
88:03 - stuff
88:05 - right yeah yeah well the other text so
88:06 - you see that now we've got another two
88:07 - children inside of video called info
88:10 - right so in here we would have the title
88:13 - of the video so we'd have
88:15 - let's just call it let's just say a p
88:17 - let's just say the title
88:18 - so we'll have the title okay um then
88:21 - we'll have the
88:23 - so let's go back and check so we've got
88:24 - the title then we've got
88:26 - the number of chat no channel name sorry
88:30 - yeah you're right
88:31 - channel name yeah
88:34 - so here will be a channel name next
88:38 - and then here we can say p and then
88:41 - the number i think it's used number of
88:44 - views yeah yeah
88:46 - yeah number of views and then we've got
88:48 - the posted date
88:50 - so we can do this again boom boom
88:55 - nice nice nice nice nice beautiful guys
88:58 - beautiful and now you can see right now
89:00 - it's sort of like obviously it's going
89:01 - to be empty because
89:03 - we've sort of changed everything to
89:04 - actually take the props that we pass in
89:06 - but the actual when we render the
89:09 - components we don't actually
89:11 - say what the props are right so exactly
89:13 - let's go ahead and actually get some
89:15 - sort of dummy data now so
89:16 - for the first one what we can do is we
89:18 - can kind of just go ahead and grab like
89:20 - let's go ahead and grab a dummy
89:21 - thumbnail or something so let's just say
89:23 - thumbnail
89:24 - uh youtube oh
89:27 - oh man be careful the images yeah
89:32 - there we go we got lucky there so
89:36 - copy the image
89:44 - yeah yeah yeah i'm just gonna pass that
89:47 - in as one
89:48 - so we can do that and then we can see
89:49 - immediately look that's it like a
89:50 - thumbnail i mean it's huge but we can
89:52 - resize all this stuff
89:54 - um then we can go ahead and say the
89:56 - title of this video
89:57 - could be something like uh test video
90:01 - something like that or just like
90:05 - yeah let's just call it test video um
90:07 - and then you've got the
90:08 - also you've got the channel name so
90:10 - channel name
90:12 - we can call this one clever programmer
90:14 - mm-hmm
90:15 - yeah and then we also have let's say um
90:20 - he posted oh no number of views
90:24 - yeah a number of views and all of views
90:27 - yeah
90:28 - yep and here we could say five million
90:31 - yeah yeah we can say
90:36 - let's say like 5.2 million
90:39 - views there you go nice and then we can
90:42 - say
90:43 - um the posted
90:48 - number eight oh sorry so so number of
90:50 - views would actually just be a number i
90:52 - guess right and then we would render it
90:53 - with
90:54 - i mean you could do it either way yeah
90:56 - it could do it yeah for now let's just
90:57 - keep it simple man
90:58 - we'll just keep it yeah where's that
91:00 - here we could go ahead and do something
91:02 - like
91:03 - um so oops what was the posted date it
91:07 - was just something like
91:08 - close today let's do like three days ago
91:10 - yeah
91:11 - three space days slash ago yeah
91:15 - beautiful yeah and now guys you can see
91:18 - there we go
91:18 - we have like a very small sort of like
91:21 - test video clever programmer 5.2 million
91:23 - views
91:24 - and three days ago and that thumbnail is
91:26 - doing really well right now
91:29 - apparently yeah nice
91:32 - guys give us a thumbs up for the
91:34 - thumbnail guys who likes that thumbnail
91:36 - you know
91:36 - yes it took 5.2 million views
91:40 - nice so we've already created a video
91:42 - called css so here we can see a video
91:44 - called css
91:45 - and then like for this image right so
91:47 - what we can go ahead and do is give this
91:48 - one a class name
91:50 - a class name and then we'll just close
91:51 - one video card
91:53 - thumbnail like that thumbnail
91:56 - um and then we can style this one
91:59 - because right now that thumbnail is huge
92:01 - right so what we can do i think we can
92:03 - actually say if we do width 100
92:06 - is it gonna it should fit inside of its
92:07 - container there we go
92:09 - yeah yeah the parent had a 0.25
92:14 - sort of rule being applied and then we
92:16 - said yeah to the image
92:18 - only use up 100 of what you're allowed
92:20 - to basically so
92:21 - it's only yeah what it should be that's
92:23 - the correct way of doing it guys like if
92:25 - you do it any other way
92:26 - you kind of you're going to run into a
92:27 - corner case where it's going to be like
92:29 - some headache or something you've got to
92:30 - deal with
92:31 - and it's also yeah like if you resize it
92:33 - you see that you kind of solve that
92:35 - issue
92:35 - so ignore that border problem we'll fix
92:37 - that in this afterwards
92:38 - yeah yeah but for now okay
92:42 - so yeah cool um i think i think that's
92:45 - maybe
92:45 - um so so go with that okay we're good
92:49 - with that pretty much
92:50 - yeah so now let's go ahead and add the
92:53 - image so the sort of thumbnail um as in
92:56 - the channel image
92:57 - url so i think okay using avatar or
93:00 - something like avatar
93:02 - so well i think do we not have a clever
93:04 - pokemon hold on let me see
93:06 - oh yeah i might have i think i just i
93:08 - can just give you a clever programmer
93:09 - one hold on copy image
93:11 - copy image and then oh there we go yeah
93:14 - just copy yeah just download on those
93:16 - yeah and grab this one yeah nice
93:20 - okay so so we can go ahead and we want
93:22 - this one to go like somewhere
93:24 - um like here so we wanted to kind of go
93:27 - on this left side
93:28 - right yeah what we can do is we can go
93:30 - into our video card.js
93:33 - and we can basically say so that's this
93:36 - one here so we need to go back into
93:40 - and drag that here let's go back here
93:42 - and we can basically say that the
93:45 - channel image url
93:48 - should be this one
93:53 - i don't know if that's a correct oh wow
93:54 - that's not that's a holly doesn't it
93:56 - holy molly oh right man he is
93:59 - oh yeah okay there you go okay
94:04 - and you see like right now i mean like
94:06 - it doesn't look like it guys but if we
94:07 - inspect this
94:09 - it actually has got like a sort of round
94:11 - sort of border so you see that border
94:13 - now do you know a shortcut for getting
94:14 - it to sort of make a circle out of that
94:17 - oh yeah i do yeah so oh yeah what we can
94:20 - do here
94:21 - is let's go ahead and target that so
94:24 - uh i'll show you i'll show you guys a
94:26 - different way of targeting so
94:28 - you either can do this right we can give
94:29 - it a class name or you can actually go
94:31 - ahead and say like for example in this
94:33 - case
94:33 - we're going to go inside the video card
94:35 - info so video card info
94:36 - here and then we can say target the the
94:40 - direct
94:40 - child which is an image yeah so are we
94:44 - are we trying to get a border around
94:45 - that image we're trying to get a border
94:47 - or we're trying to have it where it's
94:48 - just a circle
94:49 - um so you know how they have it here so
94:52 - in youtube yeah oh it's like a little
94:54 - circle right
94:56 - yeah so right now i mean the only reason
94:59 - ours looks like a circle is because it
95:00 - is actually a picture of a circle a
95:02 - circle
95:03 - but it feels like a square image we kind
95:05 - of want to crop out the circle right
95:07 - yeah so how do we go ahead and do that
95:11 - so what we would do and okay so i'll
95:13 - take over here for a second here so
95:14 - what we would do is if we go to
95:18 - our our what what is it called not the
95:20 - sidebar
95:21 - the main container is in the main
95:22 - container yeah there we go
95:25 - if you are in the main container right
95:27 - right here
95:28 - okay and if we look at our video card so
95:30 - let's go to our video card here for a
95:31 - second here
95:33 - um actually oh did you save the video
95:36 - card
95:36 - yep my name okay okay so the em
95:40 - so this image right in order for us is
95:41 - to basically to have this image kind of
95:43 - like
95:44 - um be you know the full the full width
95:47 - and just be in a circle
95:48 - one way to which you can do that is if
95:51 - you actually have a parent div
95:53 - so if you have a parent div here's why
95:56 - here's why
95:56 - because you can have the parent div
95:58 - control the circle
96:00 - right the parent div is going to control
96:02 - how it looks like
96:04 - right the parent div is going to be
96:06 - border radius
96:07 - the parent dave is going to create the
96:09 - curvature okay and then anything that's
96:11 - within it
96:11 - is just going to fit that curvature nice
96:13 - so check this out
96:15 - so if i go in here for example right and
96:17 - i say
96:18 - and i and i put this in right just like
96:21 - that
96:21 - and then for this div let's just say the
96:23 - class name and
96:24 - we're going to follow i'm going to
96:26 - follow try the bamboo so this is what
96:28 - it's called video card right video is
96:29 - that right yep so
96:31 - video card underscore underscore
96:35 - info right yep underscore underscore
96:38 - um uh channel
96:43 - image uh container oh okay so this is a
96:47 - good rule sorry guys about
96:49 - them so the reason why you use members
96:51 - so you don't get this nesting because in
96:52 - sas
96:53 - you get this like nested nested nested
96:55 - approach right
96:56 - so here yeah because it's already inside
96:58 - of this child
96:59 - what you would do instead is you would
97:00 - actually go ahead and say um
97:02 - so in this case something like channel
97:04 - image container so you could say
97:07 - you could say channel image so you'd say
97:11 - here you would just do this you'd do
97:12 - something like this because these are
97:13 - meant for villains
97:15 - uh-huh and then basically based on its
97:17 - position would be the sort of
97:19 - i know i know your point for this but
97:20 - you could do like if you want to do it
97:22 - you could do it something like this info
97:23 - channel image container
97:25 - oh really okay gotcha gotcha gotcha okay
97:28 - okay okay
97:28 - really long nest in sas used to get this
97:31 - yeah yeah yeah
97:32 - yeah uh-huh so we just keep it as that
97:34 - like video video card channel image
97:36 - container like that
97:37 - yeah with the camera casing there you go
97:39 - beautiful okay
97:40 - so so if i go ahead and do that and then
97:42 - and now i'm going to go ahead and copy
97:43 - this specific div
97:44 - right okay and then i go to video card
97:46 - as css and then if i
97:48 - target that specific div now so let's go
97:51 - ahead and do
97:52 - um dot video card image container right
97:55 - yeah
97:55 - all i have to do is i do so so i'm gonna
97:58 - let's go ahead like what height and
97:59 - width do we want to like set for that
98:01 - like what is the height of like a
98:02 - thumbnail that we want to use
98:03 - like go ahead and inspect so this double
98:05 - check so we can go ahead and do this
98:07 - we can say inspect and the way i would
98:09 - check that height is i would click this
98:10 - little inspector tool
98:12 - and then go here and you see when it
98:13 - hovers over it says it's 36 by 36
98:17 - okay so let's do so okay so we're gonna
98:19 - we're gonna do
98:20 - height height is 36 pixels
98:24 - 36 pixels and then the width is also
98:27 - going to be
98:28 - 36 pixels right okay right so we're
98:31 - gonna we're gonna we're gonna keep it uh
98:32 - basically a square
98:33 - okay and then what's going to happen
98:34 - guys now how do we so if this is a
98:36 - screen
98:36 - let's just say i'm gonna set a border
98:38 - for now i'm gonna say border
98:39 - and i'm gonna say one pixel right solid
98:42 - and i'm
98:43 - to say this is going to be orange
98:44 - because why not
98:48 - because orange okay and if we save that
98:50 - and we can go back to go
98:52 - can we go back to what the output yep so
98:55 - we can go and check
98:56 - out
99:00 - okay so you can see you can see that you
99:02 - see that the orange and
99:03 - in that thumbnail it does not really
99:05 - it's not really fitting that specific
99:07 - border right it's just it's outside of
99:08 - that right
99:09 - so what we will do what we will do is
99:13 - we will do for this specific one for
99:15 - this image we will say
99:17 - uh we actually we don't want to use uh
99:20 - that what we will do instead is we'll do
99:22 - it like
99:23 - hold on we'll do a video image container
99:26 - okay
99:27 - right inside here and then we'll target
99:30 - the image just like you did before right
99:32 - because now
99:32 - because the image why because the image
99:35 - is within this
99:36 - video card channel image container so on
99:39 - this side we will now set the width to
99:41 - be a hundred percent
99:42 - yep a hundred percent
99:46 - and that's pretty much it right so with
99:47 - a hundred percent okay
99:49 - okay okay so yeah so now we have in a
99:53 - circle right
99:54 - but look but you see the border the
99:56 - border is the bounding box so it's not a
99:58 - circle
99:58 - yet because if we put something that's
100:00 - not a circle it's just gonna take up the
100:01 - whole space
100:02 - nice so what do you think we should do
100:04 - guys in order to
100:06 - be to have it be like a circle like what
100:08 - do you think we should do
100:10 - drop it in the comments below well check
100:12 - this out
100:13 - check this out here's what we'll do if
100:15 - we go back to the code
100:17 - we want to create that curvature that
100:19 - full curve that's a circle
100:20 - the only way for us to create a circle
100:22 - with a a
100:23 - deal is we by simply setting the border
100:26 - radius
100:27 - okay oh fifty percent okay
100:31 - and that is it so save that now go back
100:34 - to that
100:35 - nice you see now it's a circle
100:38 - right so then and then so okay now check
100:41 - this out you see how sometimes the
100:42 - orange thing is like shows up and
100:43 - doesn't
100:44 - so here's what we do the reason why the
100:46 - reason why why do you guys think that
100:47 - the orange shows up on the top and left
100:49 - and right but does not show up you know
100:50 - on the curvature
100:51 - why pretty happy i think i feel like i
100:53 - know this one
100:56 - so so now okay so what we want to do now
100:59 - is we actually go let's go back to the
101:00 - code here for a second
101:01 - okay but you actually want to go ahead
101:03 - and we do want to do overflow
101:05 - hidden okay so save that
101:10 - nice so what's going to happen so check
101:12 - this out so
101:13 - what this what this does now basically
101:14 - is anything the image the image
101:16 - if the image tries to go uh you know
101:18 - above above that specific thing
101:20 - um you know above that container it's
101:24 - it oh yeah overflow any overflow hidden
101:26 - it's it's going to basically hide it
101:28 - so yeah that and that's pretty much it
101:30 - man that's awesome dude that was nice
101:32 - and look guys
101:33 - you can see like if we just exaggerate
101:35 - the background here see red
101:37 - like you can see like it's actually the
101:39 - bounding sort of container here actually
101:41 - has like a red outline so
101:42 - that's just showing you that the
101:43 - container is actually sort of cropping
101:46 - the image inside of it right so like is
101:47 - that yeah yeah and then we're saying
101:49 - anything that kind of goes over or
101:50 - spills over it
101:51 - don't show it that's what overflow
101:52 - hidden exactly exactly it's like a it's
101:54 - like a css crop automatically
101:56 - exactly so when you're actually doing
101:58 - that i'd really recommend this line
102:00 - right here but then once you're done
102:02 - you can actually go ahead and comment
102:03 - this out and then you get this sort of
102:05 - container and then what you can do is
102:06 - just to double check that everything's
102:07 - still good
102:08 - if you go ahead and do this but you
102:10 - actually inspect
102:11 - the channel um i know i won't actually
102:14 - show you okay so yeah when you're when
102:15 - you're developing it i would definitely
102:17 - recommend you keep this
102:19 - right yeah yeah and then yeah because in
102:22 - in youtube they don't actually have like
102:23 - a a sort of border around it so use this
102:26 - to make sure that you've set it up right
102:28 - and then afterwards then you can sort of
102:29 - comment this out i'll just actually keep
102:31 - this maybe comment it out
102:32 - and you can kind of just come back and
102:33 - test it out that's nice
102:35 - yeah so that's pretty much how any any
102:38 - circle is like built right now
102:39 - any any circle you guys see on the
102:41 - internet that's that's how it's built
102:43 - just through that that's actually really
102:45 - cool and honestly guys
102:46 - these are things which are like i i
102:49 - honestly like
102:50 - no it's like on off the top of your head
102:52 - how many times do you sort of
102:54 - remember these things do you ever find
102:55 - that you have to like go back and check
102:58 - up on it or like you know
102:59 - google it or yeah i mean after you do it
103:02 - like 50 times
103:04 - then no right after you do like 50 times
103:07 - because you have to like
103:08 - you know repeat repeat repeat repeat
103:10 - then you kind of know the process
103:12 - yeah right but but yeah obviously i
103:14 - still have to go back sometimes you know
103:15 - we all still i mean sonny you as well
103:17 - right you have to go back and i
103:18 - you know i i always have to go back and
103:20 - google and search some things up you
103:22 - know
103:22 - you know like for example like you know
103:24 - how to set a border
103:26 - like how to set a border sometimes the
103:28 - most basic the basic stuff we forget but
103:31 - you know
103:31 - like i've literally had points where i'm
103:33 - like oh how do i get a circle like how
103:35 - do i do this like so guys if you do run
103:36 - into that issue
103:37 - it's completely normal like it's
103:39 - completely idea so now we have another
103:41 - issue right so we
103:42 - obviously have like the sort of
103:44 - everything we've built here but
103:45 - remember guys everything that we sort of
103:47 - look at is like right now it's display
103:49 - block
103:49 - right now to fix this very easily nozzle
103:52 - what could we do here
103:55 - oh no uh well guys what do you think
103:57 - what do you guys think we can do
103:58 - yeah what are you guys thinking about
103:59 - comment let us know what you guys are
104:00 - thinking
104:01 - yeah how can we get this looking like
104:04 - like pretty much how youtube have it
104:06 - in this scenario so how can we get it
104:08 - something like this so instead of like
104:10 - how we had it
104:11 - we we want it essentially in this way
104:13 - but in our app
104:14 - right now it's completely the opposite
104:16 - is a columnar
104:17 - sort of view yeah yeah and look i think
104:20 - i think you guys got enough time to
104:21 - answer so
104:22 - hopefully you got that right but what is
104:24 - the answer sonny so what we can use is
104:26 - flexbox
104:27 - we can go ahead yeah baby exactly so
104:30 - here we have the video card info so we
104:32 - can go ahead go back here
104:34 - drop in a rule we say apply
104:38 - display flex display flex and then what
104:41 - we can do is
104:42 - before i save that we can go ahead and
104:44 - show the actual output so we can say
104:46 - this
104:46 - and i'll notice guys what happens over
104:48 - here so if i zoom in
104:50 - we can show this and now i'm going to do
104:52 - is go ahead and save
104:54 - so i'm applying this rule so display
104:56 - flex
104:57 - and look what happens there you go nice
105:00 - boom right there guys
105:02 - and what we want is we want the sort of
105:04 - this container right here
105:06 - to actually go ahead and use up as much
105:07 - room as it kind of needs i think
105:09 - at this point right now because then
105:10 - yeah we can see like it takes up pretty
105:12 - much the rest of the container
105:14 - right so what we can do is we can go
105:16 - ahead and give that thing so in this
105:18 - case let's go back to the code
105:20 - we can go ahead and give that container
105:22 - so in this case the video card info text
105:24 - gives flex one exactly nice
105:28 - nice nice nice nice and that will go
105:30 - ahead and now it's actually got this
105:31 - sort of imaginary
105:32 - sort of that you won't be able to see it
105:34 - but if we went ahead and sort of demoed
105:35 - it as quickly like border one big saw
105:38 - pixel solid yeah and then you guys will
105:40 - see that it's actually using up the rest
105:42 - of it
105:42 - right nice yeah yeah yeah beautiful
105:45 - pretty much why we want to do that so
105:46 - now we can actually go ahead and sort of
105:48 - get the styling it to the point where we
105:50 - want it so uh
105:51 - so guys this is your this is your
105:53 - youtube clone now
105:56 - this is it exactly we're done now we've
105:58 - got the image we've got the navigation
106:00 - bar i gotta say what else do you need
106:02 - i think at this point everyone's being a
106:04 - bit fussy
106:08 - it's already there you know i'm pretty
106:11 - much done
106:13 - so this one we what i like to do is to
106:16 - sort of like show you guys in a quick
106:18 - way like i just go here i pretty much
106:20 - grab this
106:20 - and then here you can actually go ahead
106:22 - and inspect the sort of styling that
106:23 - they've used
106:24 - sometimes it is nested sometimes you
106:26 - have to sort of dive deep
106:27 - but in this case you can see like they
106:29 - have 1.4 ram um
106:31 - okay so it's being a bit slow but 1.4
106:33 - ram line height so we don't really care
106:34 - about all this
106:35 - too much but why basically do is we can
106:38 - kind of just mock it and we can kind of
106:39 - get a bit closer in this case
106:41 - let's go back to our app and we can see
106:43 - here we want to kind of get this one so
106:45 - this is 1.4 ram so let's go ahead and do
106:47 - this so
106:48 - what we can do to make life a bit simple
106:50 - we can do
106:51 - class name video card and here we can
106:54 - say
106:55 - let's just call the info title
106:59 - last name and let's just copy this
107:02 - and we can rename them in a sec groups
107:06 - and then this one would be channel name
107:08 - so
107:10 - channel name this one would be number of
107:13 - views
107:16 - and the final one will be posted date
107:19 - posted date there we go nice
107:22 - all right so we have those right and
107:24 - basically firstly let's go ahead and
107:25 - install
107:26 - the uh title so the title in this case
107:29 - would be something along the lines of
107:31 - let's do this oops
107:33 - okay that's not what we want it
107:36 - okay oops i've copied the wrong thing
107:38 - i'll copy the entire line
107:42 - card title there we go and we can say
107:44 - the font size we saw was 1.4 ram so font
107:48 - size
107:49 - was 1.4 ram and if we go ahead and save
107:52 - that you see like it's a little bit
107:53 - bigger
107:54 - nice nice nice uh you could probably
107:57 - make it like a font-weight bold like
107:59 - maybe maybe make it a little bit more
108:00 - bolder
108:01 - yep so you can say font way
108:04 - uh it's just too bold let's have a seat
108:06 - let's see what that looks like okay
108:08 - nice yeah okay yeah so then what we can
108:10 - do is
108:11 - guys you can constantly go back and
108:12 - forth and you basically just want to
108:13 - keep doing it until
108:14 - you get like a perfect sort of middle
108:16 - ground because sometimes
108:18 - like you see like if we zoom out yeah
108:20 - right like and then we actually go back
108:21 - like you see like it it's it all depends
108:23 - on how far you're zooming in as well
108:25 - like
108:26 - it changes the sort of look of it you
108:27 - see that like it does change
108:29 - and rem is also taking into account the
108:32 - parent container right
108:33 - yeah so in this case what we could do
108:35 - instead is maybe find a fixed
108:38 - sort of middle ground just for now or
108:39 - something like that we could do
108:40 - something like
108:43 - what do you think or would you should we
108:44 - stick yeah
108:47 - do 20 pixels do that do that because
108:48 - then like yeah i'm not really sure
108:50 - and they might they might be confused by
108:52 - what rem is yeah exactly so in this case
108:54 - 20 pixels looks
108:55 - pretty much like along the white lines
108:57 - like yeah okay so yes we're getting sort
108:59 - of somewhat close
109:00 - okay yeah so then the next one so the
109:03 - rest of it kind of has like a very
109:04 - similar sort of color so it's like a
109:06 - gray
109:06 - and it's a bit smaller so no actually is
109:08 - it the same it's the same size really
109:10 - i think it's the same size uh it's just
109:12 - gray right so it's gray
109:13 - yeah and then we sort of it's great it's
109:15 - a bit smaller i would say it's like 16
109:17 - pixels maybe
109:18 - yeah so yeah
109:21 - maybe i don't know yeah okay yeah let's
109:25 - try it we'll see
109:25 - let's try it so in this case what we can
109:27 - go ahead and do is a
109:29 - video so let's go ahead and do channel
109:30 - name so here
109:32 - here called channel name and here we can
109:34 - say font size
109:37 - uh let's do 16 pixels and let's do color
109:41 - and when you're sort of testing out guys
109:43 - you can just did you go ahead and do
109:44 - that i just test that with the default
109:45 - naming one so like light gray
109:47 - sort of restaurant you see like it's a
109:49 - bit too light so we can go ahead yeah
109:51 - great but actually no i'll show you
109:53 - something really cool here so
109:55 - i use a color picker tool so nice um
109:58 - really handy one that i use um
110:02 - uh so like let me go ahead and bring it
110:05 - or we can even do expect element inspect
110:07 - them on the actual on the actual text
110:09 - and then get the actual color that's in
110:11 - the styles no all right there you go
110:13 - let you see it sir so it says 60 60 60.
110:17 - oh dang i love that last night
110:21 - what was that huh that's just by
110:24 - clicking the inspect so you see this if
110:25 - i click the
110:26 - uh select a target to inspect and then
110:29 - you hover over and it actually should i
110:30 - didn't know that
110:31 - oh my god 14 pixels look 14 pixels and
110:33 - this one is 14 pixels as well
110:36 - no way i did not know that this whole
110:39 - time as well i'm like look it even tells
110:40 - you like
110:41 - accessibility it tells you man that's
110:44 - cool
110:45 - this it's the little things that excite
110:46 - us man you know exactly
110:49 - that's cool so right now we can go ahead
110:52 - and that's
110:52 - that's so handy wow like i mean yeah
110:56 - tick tock clone so in this case we could
110:59 - say
110:59 - this one is um 60 60
111:03 - 60 and you see that's like a perfect
111:05 - gray the one that we saw
111:06 - and the font size was uh was it 14
111:08 - pixels right
111:10 - yeah and this one was also 14 pixels
111:13 - um if we save it now and look at that
111:15 - you can see it's actually a lot more
111:17 - it's actually quite close to like what
111:18 - we were seeing before so now
111:20 - you see the colors they're actually
111:21 - pretty close like the colors are
111:22 - actually pretty close
111:24 - yeah yeah right so now we've also got
111:26 - the watching
111:27 - and the sort of views so oh no sorry
111:30 - we're not using watching here we're
111:31 - using it like this so say something like
111:33 - uh two million views and it's got this
111:35 - little dot and then it's got this
111:37 - sort of three weeks ago sort of text so
111:39 - um i just want to grab that dot
111:41 - i mean i can't be bothered to find out
111:43 - where that is so how do we get that
111:45 - little dot
111:45 - oh man they've used it it's actually
111:48 - just
111:48 - text yeah so it's just a little text
111:51 - right or they use that they use it after
111:52 - but you don't need to use an after guys
111:54 - for that i'd say in this case you could
111:57 - do something like this so
111:58 - they you can actually put that inside of
112:00 - i mean we could just do it in one line
112:02 - really
112:04 - yeah i mean we could i mean if you want
112:06 - to put the dot in if you want to put the
112:07 - dot in
112:08 - sunny just cut literally copy the dot
112:10 - like highlight the dot and then copy
112:12 - from
112:12 - from from youtube
112:16 - like highlight it highlight the dot and
112:17 - literally just copy it no because it's
112:19 - an after tag you can't copy after tags
112:22 - no no okay all right yeah so if we could
112:25 - literally go into
112:26 - google and just type in dot i think yeah
112:29 - give us a dot um
112:33 - okay
112:37 - symbol oh yeah oh
112:40 - oh oh
112:45 - whoa where is this coming from
112:48 - what's going on
112:52 - oh man
112:54 - [Laughter]
113:07 - a lot of things happening all at the
113:08 - same time so you could do this you can
113:10 - add it in there there we go
113:12 - nice you can see a number of views and
113:15 - then it's posted date right and we can
113:16 - just change our sort of css around that
113:18 - so we can say this
113:19 - is going to be number of views and post
113:22 - let's just do this for now posted it
113:25 - all right so here we have the number of
113:27 - views and
113:28 - yeah so number of views was when we
113:30 - passed in
113:31 - so it would say something like 5.2
113:33 - million views and three days ago
113:35 - so if we go back right thing there we go
113:37 - nice
113:38 - hey look at that damn right so now what
113:42 - we can go ahead and do is we can go and
113:43 - style that a little bit so let's go to
113:45 - video card and we say number of views
113:47 - and posting date
113:48 - and here we can say color um yeah we
113:52 - just use the same color
113:53 - yep so this one and even the font size
113:55 - we could do this
113:57 - yeah and now nice okay so we've got this
114:01 - dope nice nice nice um and getting it to
114:04 - look
114:06 - as much as we okay so right so
114:09 - i think at that point oh man youtube's
114:11 - taking ages to load up
114:13 - uh because i have refreshed it and some
114:14 - reason the internet's i think they are
114:16 - oh yeah there we go
114:17 - all right so there is a little gap still
114:19 - guys that we want to account for so we
114:21 - can handle that gap in a few ways so you
114:23 - can see over here
114:25 - we've got like a little gap underneath
114:26 - the first bit of text so we can add a
114:28 - margin bottom to fix that
114:30 - right so here what we can do is we can
114:32 - actually go ahead and add a margin bomb
114:34 - um to our thing so we can go ahead and
114:36 - say title
114:38 - and we can give it oops and this should
114:39 - be not be pixel pixel
114:41 - here we can say margin bottom probably
114:44 - like eight pixels or something
114:45 - probably eight so as soon as i save that
114:48 - now we can actually go ahead and see
114:50 - um react up there we go so as soon as i
114:53 - save look what happens it
114:55 - it will push it down a little bit there
114:57 - we go there we go
114:59 - all right nice uh maybe a bit too much
115:01 - maybe it's like maybe it's like six
115:02 - i don't know yeah so six nice and then
115:06 - let's do a quick comparison
115:07 - so okay i think that's
115:11 - yeah i like that i like that it's pretty
115:14 - close
115:14 - and to be fair what we could do is we
115:15 - can actually go ahead and check so we
115:17 - can actually click this
115:18 - and all right now so they've spaced it
115:21 - out differently so you can actually see
115:22 - the spacing
115:23 - yeah okay so in this case we're just
115:25 - going to roughly sort of figure it
115:26 - there's that's pretty cool yeah
115:28 - and then we've got a gap here so we also
115:31 - want to account for that so now
115:32 - what we're going to target is actually
115:34 - the video card info
115:36 - container so the actual container itself
115:39 - right
115:40 - and what we can say is we can give that
115:41 - one i think we can give this actually um
115:44 - let's go ahead and do this here so we
115:46 - can say
115:47 - we do margin top of like 20
115:50 - i don't know 10 pixels and let's go
115:52 - ahead and show
115:53 - before we save it so let's go ahead so
115:55 - right now you can see there's no gap
115:57 - it's just sort of
115:58 - touching nearly pretty much so as soon
116:00 - as i hit save
116:02 - there we go we get like a little gap
116:03 - right nice
116:05 - so that's pretty much it i think it's a
116:06 - bit larger they got
116:08 - maybe like 15 pixels no i think
116:11 - yeah yeah i think it should be fine i
116:13 - actually looked at their css they
116:14 - actually have a margin top of like
116:16 - 12 only so yeah yeah let's go ahead and
116:19 - give it 12.
116:21 - okay nice so 12. um and then you see
116:24 - here guys like this has got so this is
116:26 - going to touch the left side so this is
116:28 - good
116:28 - but here this inner text right so we can
116:31 - either apply some
116:32 - padding to this and it's all margin left
116:35 - to this text
116:36 - so sort of this container or we can give
116:39 - a margin right to this
116:40 - image but i think in this case it'll be
116:42 - simpler just to add uh margin left to
116:44 - this stuff right here
116:46 - so yeah in our code it's called info
116:49 - text
116:50 - so sort of the one that we're looking at
116:51 - is info text
116:53 - which is wrapping all of that stuff and
116:55 - if we go here to info text and we say
116:57 - margin left i think it's 12 pixels
117:01 - 12 pixels nice so we save that and you
117:04 - can see now it's no longer touching
117:06 - right so yeah there you go if i undo
117:08 - that and i show you guys
117:10 - so if i undo that so go back to the code
117:13 - and i save it you can see it textures
117:16 - and then if we
117:17 - redo it we can see it's a margin of 12
117:20 - pixels
117:21 - boom yeah yeah no not touching nice
117:26 - we're not going to worry about this eps
117:28 - uh where you basically have a
117:29 - continuation
117:30 - uh that's just like an extra thing even
117:31 - the three dots because that's sort of a
117:34 - perfect um but like you guys can take it
117:37 - further and you guys can
117:38 - mess around this is sort of an internal
117:40 - tool so we're just kind of getting it
117:42 - yeah
117:42 - to roughly look like the sort of youtube
117:44 - thing right
117:45 - so yeah now what we're gonna do is also
117:48 - can you notice how guys like it has this
117:50 - little spacing between
117:52 - the components right so to basically to
117:55 - be able to test this out
117:56 - what we're going to do is we're going to
117:57 - go ahead and render two of these
118:00 - so let's go ahead and render two so
118:02 - let's go ahead
118:03 - and go to main container and rather than
118:05 - rendering empty stuff i'm going to go
118:07 - ahead
118:08 - and render two video cards well so let's
118:11 - just say like
118:12 - four or four of the same video yeah yeah
118:14 - yeah
118:15 - and now you see there we go right my
118:18 - zoom is actually messed up in this one i
118:20 - think
118:20 - so if we go ahead and go to 100
118:26 - i think you have the you see the border
118:28 - you could probably just remove the max
118:29 - high border on there in the
118:31 - uh the border around that that thing
118:33 - which is creating that
118:35 - in inside of the video card
118:38 - yeah i'm very curious what's going on
118:39 - with that border yeah because even the
118:42 - the width is broken right now you see
118:43 - that
118:46 - for whatever see the width is being
118:49 - weird right now so like you see like
118:50 - what here
118:51 - like if i do your localhost 3000 oh no
118:53 - no so okay i don't know why that's
118:55 - happening i think it's because i'm
118:56 - zooming in so much
118:57 - right there we go so that looks really
118:59 - nice and that looks pretty
119:00 - like we're getting there now so yeah
119:03 - we're again there yeah that's going to
119:04 - look a lot more like the actual sort of
119:06 - app that we're going for so like if you
119:08 - and then even even like for example
119:09 - sunday if you had like a fifth one
119:11 - that should go to the bottom like if you
119:14 - had a fifth video card let's try that
119:15 - right now
119:16 - yeah so let's go ahead and try that so
119:19 - go to
119:20 - uh main container so main container.js
119:23 - and let's go add in a fifth
119:27 - and we just hit save so i'm going to hit
119:30 - save on that
119:31 - and we can see right
119:34 - so it's squeezed in right yeah but what
119:37 - we could do here
119:38 - is we could do a wrap i think rap would
119:40 - fix it
119:41 - yep that should fix it honestly yeah so
119:43 - main container
119:45 - is what we need to target so we've got
119:47 - display flex flex start
119:49 - um we could do here uh flex wrap and we
119:52 - can say yeah
119:53 - right as soon as i hit save now i think
119:56 - is this because maybe we're doing the um
119:59 - i think is it a line items flex start
120:01 - maybe
120:02 - no
120:07 - flex wrap flag zero zero point what's
120:10 - what's the individual flex
120:12 - okay so the individual video card
120:16 - how many do they have about flex 0.25
120:18 - yeah
120:20 - okay um i think i think that we also
120:24 - have to
120:24 - add a flex bases as well on on the video
120:27 - cards as well
120:28 - right space yeah
120:31 - okay so flex basis and then
120:38 - i never usually add a flex basis
120:42 - um kind of like so let's go ahead and
120:46 - inspect let's see what's going on here
120:47 - so
120:48 - it's going to inspect this
120:51 - so here we have the video card main
120:53 - container
120:54 - and we're saying the main container has
120:56 - a flex of 0.8
120:58 - okay it has display type flex so that's
121:00 - working
121:02 - a line items doesn't do much flex wrap
121:04 - doesn't do much
121:05 - but we're saying the video cards here
121:07 - should take 0.25 okay
121:10 - so what we could do here is rather than
121:12 - doing
121:14 - the sh there i remember this it's like
121:20 - um
121:23 - what did we do what did i do before i'm
121:25 - trying to remember
121:26 - so yeah if you have a main container so
121:28 - can you hover over the main container
121:30 - the main container div yeah okay okay
121:33 - and then the video card
121:34 - is like that can you i'm actually really
121:36 - curious can you try align content
121:38 - uh can you try adding a align content to
121:40 - the parent
121:42 - okay and try a line content
121:45 - with a value off a line count it a flex
121:49 - start
121:53 - so if that's gonna do the vertical
121:55 - alignment
121:56 - okay a line kind of like start
122:01 - just googling it as well so let's go
122:03 - ahead and check like flex
122:04 - let's just say limit
122:08 - thanks i do use this quite a lot as well
122:11 - some
122:12 - strange houses and so let's do this and
122:14 - let's just do like something i just want
122:16 - to check signs let's do a max
122:17 - width of each one so max width should be
122:19 - something like i don't know 30
122:21 - 300 pixels that yeah so if we use a max
122:23 - width can you see how like it does sort
122:25 - of like it will wrap
122:27 - yeah yeah right so that's like that's
122:30 - the sort of not so we can see our main
122:31 - container
122:32 - behavior is actually working in the way
122:33 - we want but the flex sort of 0.25
122:37 - isn't doing exact thing that we kind of
122:39 - want it to here so it's not actually
122:41 - so we're saying that each one should be
122:43 - using up 0.25
122:45 - but i think there's something about flex
122:48 - effects oh that's it we set maybe a min
122:50 - width
122:54 - yeah yeah min width is something like 25
122:58 - yeah there we go we could do a min width
123:01 - of 25
123:02 - because you're saying that otherwise
123:04 - they're saying that every child should
123:05 - get
123:06 - yeah it's still strange though i mean
123:08 - i'm sure there's like a flex
123:10 - grow or something here we should be
123:11 - using yeah
123:14 - but to fix it for now we could do that
123:15 - we can go ahead and do that and that
123:17 - will actually sort
123:17 - out in line with our rule so we're
123:19 - saying the video card here
123:22 - should actually have something like a um
123:25 - say a min with of 25
123:29 - and if you guys have any sort of ideas
123:31 - around that would love to hear it
123:33 - because
123:33 - it's always interesting seeing how
123:35 - people use flexbox and sort of get
123:36 - this going you know yeah um so see so
123:40 - now okay that's good
123:41 - so we have that all right um
123:44 - so now i'm gonna go and do is i don't
123:47 - know why it comes up weird on there
123:49 - okay so let me go ahead and actually i'm
123:51 - just sorting out the screen so that way
123:53 - oh somebody mentioned flex shrink okay
123:56 - you move if you do flex strength zero
123:59 - actually
124:00 - so actually try that i'm just really
124:01 - curious like if you on the video card
124:03 - um if you remove the max width and you
124:05 - just do a flex
124:07 - shrink of zero okay
124:11 - so video card flex shrink of zero so
124:13 - flex
124:14 - shrink but that'll have to be on every
124:17 - single item
124:18 - in the video card okay so let's go to
124:21 - video card and then say flex
124:23 - shrink my uh my work might not work i'm
124:27 - not sure
124:30 - okay did it no no did not never mind
124:35 - interesting though i mean i feel like
124:36 - there is some kind of you know there
124:38 - there will be some kind of flex grow 25
124:42 - flex shrink one
124:44 - yeah i think let's keep it a minute
124:46 - width for now like we'll we can always
124:48 - we can always make it better
124:49 - yeah but that's an interesting sort of
124:51 - care sort of case that you might run
124:53 - into so
124:53 - 25 yeah and that's sort of like a hack
124:55 - around fixing that so
124:57 - here the reason why i sort of doing this
124:59 - as well is because
125:00 - of um why is it spacing out weird why
125:03 - have we got this
125:06 - video card video card main container
125:09 - main container we've got effects effects
125:11 - line items
125:12 - effects wrap what the hell
125:16 - why is it coming out i have some weird
125:18 - like
125:19 - caching going on you see like if i do
125:21 - this now
125:22 - what the hell okay that's even more
125:24 - weird
125:26 - is yours coming up on localhost let's
125:28 - see hold on because i'm looking at yours
125:30 - right now hold on
125:32 - oh this is interesting
125:36 - so we have video card oh okay video card
125:38 - has a mate uh
125:40 - a max height say if we get rid of that
125:42 - max height
125:47 - no that's just a max height though yeah
125:49 - that shouldn't do it
125:50 - min width of 25 pixels
125:55 - okay so main container go go to main
125:58 - container hold on
125:59 - go to main container
126:03 - border flex align item center
126:06 - align items right now okay do a l do
126:09 - align content do a line content
126:11 - hold on okay so a line item should be
126:13 - flexed let's start
126:14 - select start and then do align content
126:16 - also do the flex turn that as well
126:18 - okay here here we go yeah did that work
126:21 - yeah so flex start align items
126:23 - uh i like content yeah so nice okay cool
126:26 - of course
126:27 - so uh main container
126:30 - i would say some somebody said space
126:33 - between and a minimum then get rid of
126:34 - effects and 1.25 okay
126:36 - so you can do that oh i think you know
126:40 - if we
126:40 - oh no no we do want it to be because if
126:42 - it's not if it's smaller you want it to
126:43 - grow
126:44 - okay perfect yeah so so now we have that
126:46 - okay so now what we could do is
126:47 - basically we need to handle the sort of
126:50 - margins
126:50 - now as well like so in this case how do
126:54 - we apply
126:54 - a margin to and without breaking that
126:57 - side you see what i mean
126:58 - we're gonna have yeah yeah so so that
127:00 - way so if we actually the way like
127:02 - so if we actually because we set the min
127:05 - width of like
127:06 - point 25 percent right yeah um if you
127:09 - had a margin it's going to push it down
127:10 - now
127:11 - because because so what we have to do i
127:13 - think is like
127:14 - actually initially let's go just let's
127:15 - just add a margin let's go ahead and
127:17 - just add a margin to individual video
127:18 - card and see what happens
127:19 - so margin right yeah yeah
127:23 - let's just say 20 pixels
127:27 - oh yeah oh
127:31 - yeah yeah okay
127:35 - oh wait a minute a line content flex
127:37 - start yeah where does that happen again
127:39 - so if we save this oh god okay so main
127:42 - container
127:43 - all right sorry i accidentally i put
127:45 - this in the wrong one so this should be
127:47 - i did yeah this should be a lion content
127:50 - should be here there we go oh yeah yeah
127:51 - yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah
127:53 - it's pushed over all right nice nice
127:55 - nice
127:56 - okay so what what do we what do we do in
127:58 - this case
127:59 - is because you guys see because we added
128:02 - a margin
128:03 - the menu with 25 right means that
128:06 - every single item is 25 but the problem
128:10 - now becomes
128:11 - the fact that um not everything will we
128:14 - won't be able to fit
128:16 - four items which we're supposed to right
128:18 - because the margin
128:19 - you know basically removes some of the
128:20 - space right so
128:23 - the only way for us to pretty much do
128:24 - this is just to actually do like a
128:25 - minute width like 22 percent
128:27 - yeah no you're right because otherwise
128:29 - you're going to get into this weird
128:30 - situation
128:31 - where yeah so if you try like maybe with
128:33 - like 22 or something something like that
128:35 - like 22 percent or
128:37 - um there you go so like that
128:40 - but you see like then the right i am so
128:43 - in this case
128:45 - um i think okay for now i think that's
128:47 - fine we could go with that
128:48 - yeah yeah we can approve that because
128:51 - what we can do
128:52 - yeah because then you could go further
128:54 - and do like rows and stuff like that but
128:56 - for this tutorial i think it's going to
128:58 - be good because this is just to get a
128:59 - rough demonstration of what it's going
129:01 - to look like
129:01 - so yeah it's a min width of 22 hits the
129:04 - sweet spot so
129:06 - 22 nice okay now also
129:10 - notice how in the youtube app they're
129:11 - not touching right so they're not
129:13 - touching they have that little gap
129:15 - here right so what we can do now is we
129:18 - can actually add a margin underneath
129:19 - each video card which would
129:21 - sort of fix us you can say margin bottom
129:24 - and we can add like a slightly
129:25 - bigger one so 30 pixels or something you
129:28 - see like there
129:29 - so if we go ahead and save that now nice
129:33 - we get like a little gap there nice
129:34 - that's good that's good they like that
129:37 - so that's pretty cool
129:38 - so we have that up and running in the
129:40 - way we want it
129:41 - um okay that's that's really nice
129:44 - um okay what we can do now is
129:48 - the entire thing so the entire thing has
129:50 - like a slight
129:51 - gray color behind it right so you see
129:54 - here it has like
129:55 - a slight sort of gray background mm-hmm
129:58 - what we can do is we go ahead and
129:59 - inspect
130:00 - that gray background so we can go ahead
130:02 - and see like
130:03 - what i would do so i'll show you guys
130:05 - the tool that i use so i use this little
130:06 - pipette thing
130:07 - okay called colorzilla and you click it
130:10 - and you click pick
130:11 - color from the page that sounds so that
130:14 - sounds so epic color zillow you know
130:15 - like godzilla
130:16 - yeah you know yeah exactly then you get
130:19 - this sort of weird sort of like little
130:20 - thing pop up this little sort of
130:22 - and then basically you just go ahead and
130:24 - you see it pops up at the top
130:25 - and you just find it and you click it
130:27 - and then what you'll do is it'll color
130:29 - the actual hexadecimal code so
130:31 - now if i go back to my thing and we go
130:34 - to the main container
130:36 - the background color and we set that to
130:41 - what i just copied that's just the white
130:43 - color though
130:44 - um oh god that's white yeah
130:50 - but you see there's a gray right yeah
130:52 - it's a great yeah
130:55 - bell so so my my color picker failed me
130:58 - guys
130:59 - let's try again your color your color
131:02 - picker is color blind you know
131:03 - i know i like it's like this is trying
131:05 - to figure out what the hell is going on
131:06 - like
131:09 - okay so i'm not even popping up at this
131:10 - point okay wait so we have
131:12 - okay so there you go that's like a yeah
131:15 - yeah that that's better that's better
131:17 - if i go over here okay it's freaking out
131:19 - guys
131:20 - give us some applause for the color
131:21 - picker yeah
131:27 - this is hilarious let me go ahead and we
131:29 - go
131:30 - oh i haven't looked oh my god oh i did
131:32 - an applause but because you're on the
131:33 - wrong screen it didn't do it it was
131:35 - muted
131:36 - oh really yeah wait wait round the boat
131:42 - [Applause]
131:43 - good job
131:48 - so now let me go back and see hey
131:53 - did that apply uh yep yeah looks like
131:56 - it's there right
131:56 - is there yeah it's just yeah i think
131:58 - very light yeah
132:00 - and guys just to exaggerate what we've
132:01 - just changed there so
132:03 - if i go ahead and change it to red you
132:06 - see that that's what we were sort of
132:07 - going for like that background
132:08 - we're just giving it like that looks
132:10 - horrible okay so back to
132:14 - very subtle gray behind it right yeah
132:17 - okay nice um and now what we're going to
132:19 - do is i actually have some
132:21 - let me turn off my flux so this is like
132:24 - it saves your eyes when you're working
132:25 - late
132:26 - oh yeah okay so now what we're going to
132:29 - go ahead and do
132:30 - is actually add some padding to this but
132:33 - you see like in their section they have
132:35 - something like recommended right it says
132:36 - recommended at the top
132:40 - so you see it says yeah we could do that
132:42 - could you recommend it yeah that's fine
132:44 - so we could go ahead and like add
132:46 - something like that but in this case i
132:47 - guess like where we have it here main
132:49 - container
132:49 - so this is actually sort of the main
132:51 - container is actually sort of
132:52 - responsible for
132:53 - everything so what we could do here is
132:55 - we could kind of rename
132:57 - main container to oh no not rename so we
133:00 - could we can
133:01 - what do you mean no if you wanna if you
133:02 - actually are you talking about like um
133:04 - are you talking about like uh you wanna
133:06 - add a recommended text is that what you
133:08 - wanna add
133:09 - yeah i mean just add it add it to the
133:12 - parents no
133:13 - add it to where you have the them
133:17 - so here right so yeah yeah so it's like
133:19 - here so sidebar
133:21 - ah actually this is how this does have
133:23 - to be inside the main container my bed
133:24 - you're right you're right you're right
133:25 - yeah you're right maybe do something
133:26 - like um just click into this we could do
133:29 - something like
133:30 - every rule we've it's only this one so
133:32 - that's fine we could do this we could
133:33 - say main container
133:34 - um let's create a div so we can say div
133:37 - and this is going to be this is going to
133:38 - be the actual main container
133:40 - and that's going to have everything here
133:42 - copy that paste it inside there
133:44 - and this one we can say main container
133:46 - videos
133:48 - and then we could rename that to videos
133:50 - and then the main container
133:52 - would basically so now you see the app
133:54 - hasn't actually changed but the height
133:55 - would have changed yeah in a sec
133:59 - main container here we can say is um
134:04 - oh right is that because of the flex 0.8
134:06 - and everything yeah yes
134:07 - so now you have to keep yeah now you
134:09 - have to keep doing flex grow and all
134:11 - this stuff yeah now
134:13 - all right so we can do effects
134:17 - so main container okay
134:22 - sweet
134:23 - [Music]
134:25 - so hold on save that but if i want to
134:28 - make like oh right if i need to save
134:29 - this one as well
134:31 - yeah let's go back
134:34 - this let's just add a h1 saying
134:36 - recommended for now that just yeah
134:37 - recommended and then we can see so
134:42 - okay that's fine
134:45 - we can we can keep it as this this is
134:46 - fine because you'll remove the border
134:48 - and
134:48 - all because the gray color right is the
134:50 - gray color not in there
134:52 - oh right yeah so here so right now what
134:54 - we could do is we could just add this
134:55 - here and that would that should that
134:58 - should give everything agree
134:59 - right let's see it does it yeah we gave
135:02 - it
135:03 - yeah perfect perfect perfect it does
135:04 - right yeah yep yeah yeah it does
135:06 - yeah nice so now what we can do is we
135:08 - can go ahead and get rid of that border
135:09 - so that because we can see that it's all
135:11 - good
135:12 - um and then we can actually go ahead and
135:14 - sort of style it to
135:16 - start looking a bit more like this so at
135:19 - the top we have like a bit of a gap
135:21 - at the top so that so so firstly the
135:23 - size of this is
135:24 - really wrong so we can do is we can go
135:26 - ahead and inspect this
135:27 - you can see this one is 20 pixels and it
135:30 - has like a slightly gray color we can
135:31 - ignore the color for now
135:32 - just to get the first bit right so we
135:35 - can say
135:36 - firstly let's do a h2 because it
135:38 - shouldn't be a
135:39 - it shouldn't be that then we can say h2
135:42 - um and
135:44 - let's just call it class name because we
135:46 - can say main container
135:49 - let's just call it main container title
135:51 - so that main container title
135:54 - font size is
135:57 - 20 pixels not kidding me i sometimes
136:00 - have to
136:01 - go to google to figure out how to do
136:02 - font size what's that
136:05 - i sometimes have to google to pick a
136:06 - font size i don't know why yeah
136:09 - oh guys just also notice how the sidebar
136:11 - got scrunched
136:12 - right yeah yeah you have to put flex on
136:16 - the out the actual connection yep yep
136:18 - beautiful yeah
136:18 - nice nice nice yeah good catch man good
136:21 - catch
136:21 - yeah because otherwise it doesn't tell
136:23 - it to correctly use that spacing yeah
136:25 - let's put a little bit like a margin
136:27 - padding into that h1
136:29 - yeah so the first thing you guys notice
136:31 - how like
136:32 - so before we do the padding to the h1
136:34 - let's add a padding to the overall
136:35 - container
136:36 - so you see like oh yeah like this one so
136:39 - let's add maybe like a 20
136:41 - sort of oh should we just add a margin
136:42 - left i guess right
136:48 - yeah let's do here here let's do let's
136:51 - do a
136:52 - for now let's do a margin left and
136:54 - there's actually going to be
136:55 - and oh you see it look actually yeah
136:58 - well
136:59 - because here's the thing their margin
137:00 - changes so you basically they keep four
137:03 - tabs they keep four things
137:04 - open right but basically it gets
137:06 - scrunched up so basically
137:08 - the margin changes it's just that the
137:10 - content stays the same you know what i
137:12 - mean
137:12 - yeah but for now for now
137:16 - i think it'll be fine just to add some
137:17 - margin to the left just for now
137:19 - yeah so here basically we could
137:21 - essentially do something like
137:23 - spring container margin left
137:26 - yeah many pixels you can do like margin
137:28 - top as well
137:30 - yeah uh yeah legend top
137:37 - nice uh i know it's how guys so
137:40 - this is this is something you don't want
137:42 - to happen now so margin adds a spacing
137:44 - around it right
137:45 - which means that you lose the background
137:47 - color so in this case
137:48 - instead of a margin we can use padding
137:51 - yep we keep
137:52 - that background color nice nice nice and
137:55 - then what we do is we space out that
137:57 - that sort of uh the text as we want it
137:59 - now so
138:00 - the container title can have a margin
138:02 - beneath it so that way we can kind of
138:03 - space it out to look a bit like this
138:06 - so you can say margin bottom
138:09 - pixels dude i love stream deck it's so
138:11 - crazy
138:16 - wait what are you using to stream like
138:18 - for you like to switch windows or what
138:20 - no because i'm using streamlight to do
138:21 - all this stuff like you see like this
138:23 - to show oh yeah yeah
138:26 - yeah yeah yeah nice nice you know
138:30 - um so we've got this margin top of like
138:32 - let's just say
138:34 - another 10 pixels nice okay
138:37 - so you can see like that's actually
138:38 - starting to sort of take shape to that
138:41 - yeah yeah we're starting to get somewhat
138:42 - of a shape here like to looking like
138:44 - that right
138:45 - nice uh at this point i think literally
138:48 - once we get the sort of implementation
138:50 - for this page patient i think we'll save
138:52 - maybe
138:52 - the rest of the build for the youtube
138:54 - clone right what do you think
138:56 - yeah i would yeah i would say yeah
138:58 - because it will probably yeah
139:00 - so you're saying basically let's go
139:02 - ahead and set up the actual um
139:04 - let's go ahead and set up the actual
139:06 - uploading of the thumbnail and then the
139:07 - youtube club will be later that we is
139:08 - though you're talking about
139:09 - yeah so we'll we'll get the sort of
139:10 - sidebar start the top bit start and
139:12 - we'll get the thumbnail implemented
139:14 - and yeah at that point i think we should
139:16 - leave it there
139:17 - and we should maybe save the rest of it
139:19 - so even like you know we can extend it
139:21 - maybe or we can maybe like create a
139:23 - complete youtube clone tutorial
139:25 - yeah guys what do you think what do you
139:26 - think we should do should we go ahead
139:28 - and create a completely
139:29 - like a youtube clone tutorial uh later
139:32 - on
139:33 - right and just gonna finish what we have
139:35 - right now or what do you think what just
139:37 - let us know in the comments below
139:38 - yeah um but i but i think yeah let's
139:41 - like
139:41 - i think um i think we could just finish
139:45 - up but we kind of have finished up some
139:47 - of the things we have right now
139:48 - i was i was initially thinking of doing
139:50 - like a two-part series video since we're
139:51 - doing this stuff right now
139:52 - super serious videos but uh we could
139:55 - probably do a youtube clone as well so
139:57 - but let's finish up let's finish up what
139:59 - we have right now just gonna finish
140:00 - those things up
140:01 - in terms of sidebar the navigation i
140:03 - think we should be good then let's do it
140:05 - yeah so now what we'll do is we can
140:08 - actually go ahead and
140:11 - um so we can do it so the sidebar i
140:14 - guess right so we should carry on
140:15 - signing the rest of the app so it looks
140:16 - somewhat
140:17 - in line maybe you want to do the nav
140:20 - let's do that first
140:21 - the sidebar just kind of side let's do a
140:23 - nap yeah you know
140:24 - so the logo right now looks disgusting
140:26 - so we have this yeah
140:30 - that is an a plus logo right there yeah
140:35 - nice so header right here
140:38 - but we also have to we also have to add
140:40 - remember we have to add a logo
140:42 - and we also have to add a uh um what's
140:45 - it called the
140:46 - those three three three icon thing oh
140:48 - yeah the the
140:50 - burger menu right yeah yeah yeah yeah
140:51 - burger menu so here we can add
140:54 - a image so that one image for the thing
140:57 - and then we could say another
140:58 - image uh no so this wouldn't be an image
141:00 - what we can actually go ahead and use is
141:01 - the material ui
141:03 - icon yeah yeah so you can go ahead and
141:05 - check this out and
141:06 - so we will get we'll use the search one
141:08 - afterwards but i think here we can
141:09 - actually say menu i think it is or not
141:11 - menu
141:12 - sounds like burger burger hey that might
141:15 - be i think i'm just wondering if it is
141:17 - it if it does come up on the burger
141:18 - oh it does yeah it's a menu nice oh wow
141:21 - yeah
141:23 - because i was wondering that's what i
141:24 - look at is old yeah so
141:27 - perfect uh what we can do now is we can
141:29 - actually pull that in so
141:30 - using these icons is super simple guys
141:32 - we can actually go ahead and do this
141:34 - um and if you guys are liking this smash
141:36 - the thumbs up by the way because it's
141:37 - like
141:38 - it's pretty cool i think like a way of
141:40 - doing this stuff you know like
141:42 - we can see how this goes and we can see
141:43 - like maybe we'll make more of these if
141:45 - it takes off or if not we can carry
141:47 - bones oh yeah oh guys there's so much
141:50 - coming oh you have no idea
141:52 - yeah dude we have so much planned for
141:54 - you guys
141:55 - dude wait till you come to a late sunny
141:58 - no
141:58 - dude oh man i think i feel like we're
142:02 - just getting
142:03 - i feel like then it's gonna go to a
142:04 - whole different level of content
142:06 - creation we're gonna have
142:08 - like think about like this right a video
142:10 - camera following us like
142:12 - so frankie's gonna have a video camera
142:13 - following us that's basically that's
142:14 - that's going to record as we're typing
142:16 - as we're kind of typing all on the same
142:18 - place
142:18 - yeah right oh holy can you imagine
142:22 - that like we'll be coding and then
142:23 - you've got like a dynamic
142:27 - dude the most epic coding ever that's
142:31 - what it's gonna be like literally
142:32 - you'll probably never see anybody called
142:34 - like that like like
142:36 - your camera panning around showing the
142:38 - coding you know of developers you know
142:42 - live on youtube and then literally i
142:44 - reckon we even have like we'll get all
142:46 - sorts of footage behind the scenes like
142:48 - vlog
142:55 - near the pool there's a pool there too
142:57 - uh yeah
142:58 - that's it oh man
143:01 - nice so guys we want to get the
143:04 - youtube logo right so that yeah
143:08 - where it says like let's go ahead and
143:09 - find youtube
143:11 - logo when i inspected they didn't
143:14 - actually pull in they pulled a weird
143:15 - sort of
143:16 - different one so we're going to go ahead
143:17 - and grab one from here
143:19 - and let's go ahead and let's see what's
143:21 - similar sort of closest to this let's
143:23 - maybe go ahead and grab
143:25 - this one oh dude on the right you see
143:26 - that on the one the right oh no that's
143:27 - it that's a full image never mind
143:29 - this one's a transparent so yeah let's
143:31 - use that let's use that
143:32 - let's grab that and then we go back to
143:34 - our code and you can see here image
143:36 - source
143:37 - boom there we go png nice so save that
143:41 - and then if you go back now you can see
143:42 - okay so this is good it comes up
143:46 - like the burger menu icon over here
143:48 - right
143:51 - nice and now big boy james says sonny
143:54 - where do you work
143:55 - clever programmer dude
144:02 - no he i think he meant like what country
144:03 - maybe like he's like in london oh okay
144:05 - yeah london
144:06 - yeah london yeah yeah
144:09 - we work from london nars where are you
144:11 - based i'm in detroit guys
144:14 - in detroit city that's it detroit
144:17 - city all right so the top okay so now
144:19 - we've got it named as
144:22 - the header so we've got the header so
144:25 - header logo doesn't make sense for the
144:26 - container we should say header left side
144:28 - maybe
144:29 - and header right yeah or header yeah
144:31 - yeah let the left side and header right
144:33 - side
144:34 - let's just call it like that for now
144:35 - header left side header right side
144:37 - and then the left side we have logo
144:40 - so now we're targeting that logo which
144:42 - is the image right
144:44 - so now if we go here and we say hello
144:46 - logo uh
144:48 - let's just nittan titan says thanks for
144:50 - the awesome videos you're welcome dude
144:53 - and even for him dinesh says love you
144:55 - guys with the plans you have for us
144:57 - uh it's always nice getting a little you
144:59 - know like
145:01 - like halfway through yeah nice yeah so
145:03 - header logo so now guys
145:05 - there's a nice trick here right so you
145:06 - see it's huge right
145:08 - so yeah the first thing i'll do is i'll
145:09 - actually get the rough sizing of the
145:11 - sort of one that they have so
145:13 - up here what i do is i would inspect
145:15 - that one
145:16 - and i would actually go ahead and toggle
145:18 - this sort of you know inspect icon thing
145:20 - and you can see that roughly the size is
145:22 - like
145:23 - let's just say 24 24 pixels yes oh
145:26 - height height is 24.
145:27 - so it's like high yeah so height by so
145:30 - 280 by 24
145:31 - right yeah yeah 80 by 24 so what we
145:34 - could do is we can go back to our code
145:36 - and we can it like something like this
145:38 - we could say height
145:40 - is 24 pixels width is 80 pixels but
145:43 - notice how it's probably going to mess
145:45 - up the aspect ratio
145:46 - yeah yeah it gets all stretched right uh
145:49 - yeah yeah
145:50 - so a trick so guys guys actually guys
145:53 - um who knows who knows that guys how do
145:55 - you
145:56 - not make it be like that stretch like
145:58 - what what what would you do
146:00 - to keep it the same aspect ratio but yet
146:03 - still
146:03 - have the same height like what would you
146:05 - do let us know in the comments below
146:07 - exactly like how do you fix that issue
146:09 - yeah
146:10 - because yeah like it's quite an annoying
146:12 - issue as well like is in
146:14 - until i figured this one out it was
146:15 - really really sort of like
146:17 - painstaking to get that working yeah
146:20 - well like i would sort of mess around
146:21 - with these numbers until i had it
146:22 - perfect and then
146:24 - i think they'll drop it in the comments
146:26 - okay
146:28 - i think we can just give the answer yeah
146:30 - object
146:31 - contained that is the magic rule guys
146:34 - you see like
146:35 - it goes ahead and right now i mean that
146:36 - looks wait what
146:38 - i didn't even know that hold on what you
146:40 - can do that yeah i did
146:42 - object container i didn't know that i i
146:45 - thought i thought you just put the
146:46 - height and remove the width that that
146:47 - that was my that was my thing
146:49 - if i just object fit containers this
146:51 - magical rule dude
146:53 - like bro crazy right
146:57 - and like now obviously oh this why
146:59 - didn't they realize this picture
147:00 - probably has
147:01 - like some kind of no padding yeah maybe
147:04 - something has a lot of padding
147:05 - if we say like 30 pixels height
147:09 - uh or maybe let's just go away bro
147:12 - crazy right so you see that if i do 50
147:14 - pixels higher you see it just kept it
147:16 - keeps the aspect ratio
147:18 - wow which is nice right
147:22 - very nice i didn't know that yeah still
147:25 - okay all right okay to fix this actually
147:28 - what we'll do is we'll set the
147:30 - header height so the header height on
147:32 - youtube is
147:33 - talking about this height is about maybe
147:35 - 50 pixels
147:37 - so like let's go ahead and check so
147:39 - let's do a height of like 50 pixels
147:42 - so the header so you see that now it's
147:44 - got like a height of like roughly the
147:45 - same as this
147:48 - and then what we can do is because right
147:49 - now we're doing a display flex inside of
147:51 - there we can say align
147:53 - items center and as soon as we save that
147:56 - you see like everything sort of like
147:58 - flex start now it's sort of centered at
148:00 - all right so it's nice
148:02 - which is much nicer and then what we can
148:04 - do is we can actually go ahead and make
148:05 - this one
148:06 - a little bit bigger now so we could say
148:08 - 50 or something and you see that
148:10 - then it sort of just fills it a bit more
148:12 - nice nice nice
148:13 - yeah so that works i don't know why the
148:16 - burger menu actually dropped
148:18 - below wait wait wait wait wait no
148:21 - refresh it you're cashed
148:23 - this is not right
148:26 - i don't know why my yeah it's like i
148:27 - think but i think that happened
148:29 - when i did this right because i think i
148:31 - actually messed i broke it
148:32 - when i do this you see that look then it
148:34 - because it's kind of pushing over into
148:36 - that
148:36 - element what this makes no sense
148:41 - so what we could do is firstly let's
148:43 - sort out the spacing
148:45 - and then we'll then we'll address yeah
148:47 - yeah let's
148:48 - yeah i think i think the next thing is
148:49 - like we need to figure out so for
148:50 - example like
148:51 - that so for example that input that
148:53 - search box for one is like i think
148:54 - that's that's in the center right that's
148:56 - search box
148:57 - and i think what we can do sunny as well
148:59 - is like material ui
149:01 - actually has a really nice search bar
149:02 - that we can just simply copy and
149:03 - actually use
149:04 - okay not let's just use that one because
149:06 - that one's much nicer than this so
149:08 - that one is actually let's go ahead and
149:10 - zoom out
149:11 - that one is this one here so i think
149:13 - it's input
149:14 - yes yeah it's like input
149:18 - now just css input based in just yeah
149:20 - like input that
149:35 - and it takes all the gameplay props uh
149:37 - as a normal does it really oh okay
149:39 - all right it just takes all the same
149:40 - improps and then see it just changes it
149:42 - to theirs
149:43 - but you see that the default variant
149:45 - looks a bit different
149:46 - so the variant we want so they accept
149:49 - a prop called variant and i think it's
149:51 - outlined is the one that we want so
149:53 - is it okay so now if you see
149:57 - is that sure it was outline varian
150:01 - i think if you do control space
150:04 - okay no it's not um input
150:07 - okay that's really not gonna help me and
150:10 - but
150:12 - go to the top so you've got all of the
150:13 - stuff here you've got color
150:15 - and they usually have one called
150:18 - varian i think it's called i think it's
150:21 - called
150:23 - hold on maybe it's called yeah it could
150:25 - be outline yeah outline should be the
150:27 - one
150:28 - yeah it's not usually something but i
150:30 - think it's called a text field i think
150:32 - it's not input it's called a text field
150:33 - no sunny yeah
150:34 - yeah yeah that's it you're right you're
150:36 - right you're right yeah text field api
150:37 - yeah this one right
150:41 - yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly and then
150:43 - you've got a
150:44 - variant
150:47 - yeah varian a outlined there you go
150:50 - there you go there you go yeah
150:51 - there's input yeah all right so let's go
150:53 - ahead back to the code
150:55 - and change input to this text field
150:59 - go back here to this one get rid of this
151:02 - and we can say
151:03 - variant see now it's coming up there we
151:05 - go
151:06 - equals and you see then it pops up with
151:08 - autofill and you can say outlined
151:10 - and then now we check that out
151:14 - so let's see refresh there we go
151:18 - come on let's go oh man okay it's just
151:21 - huge
151:22 - this is way too big right now uh and
151:24 - also the pen solder should say
151:25 - such just like google doc yeah so here
151:28 - let's go ahead and just add that in so
151:29 - we can say
151:30 - oops so place
151:33 - holder equals search
151:38 - and now if we do this and we refresh
151:41 - there we go okay so
151:42 - all my already when you add the search
151:43 - it kind of it makes you feel a bit more
151:45 - sane like it's not
151:46 - so ugly yeah um yeah even the icon
151:49 - button this
151:50 - let's fix that first and then we can
151:52 - determine that the header search size
151:53 - because right now it's flex one um so i
151:56 - think no no it's not fixed one but we
151:57 - can determine that in a sec so
151:59 - the button here um what we can actually
152:02 - do is set that to that icon
152:04 - right the hourglass icon so if we go to
152:06 - material ui
152:11 - we're doing yeah yeah material ui so we
152:13 - can go here we can go to
152:14 - search so here
152:18 - import search icon go back to our code
152:21 - and now we can do this
152:23 - oops import there you go search icon
152:28 - yeah boom
152:32 - now if we go back you can see that so
152:36 - it's got it right there right
152:38 - so what i like to do here to fix this
152:41 - sort of issue is this is all inside of
152:44 - header search right
152:45 - so header search what we could do is we
152:47 - can say instead of giving it
152:49 - so flex one is to give up all the space
152:51 - because it's got display flex
152:52 - so that way the two children including
152:54 - the things inside of it
152:56 - are going to be inside so they're going
152:58 - to be like sort of
152:59 - expect surrounding and we can say align
153:01 - items
153:02 - center yeah and then you can see it does
153:05 - that
153:06 - and then what we want to do is basically
153:08 - get back to this point so we want that
153:10 - button to have the width of
153:12 - see that button roughly but it's not
153:15 - even a button
153:16 - do we do we just use a button we need to
153:18 - create a button right
153:20 - oh yeah yeah yeah we need to create a
153:22 - button first yeah
153:24 - within that button right yeah yeah i
153:26 - completely missed that yeah so
153:27 - here we do to import this easier you can
153:30 - just do this
153:36 - [Music]
153:41 - okay and then here what we can do is we
153:44 - can actually go ahead and make it so
153:46 - we can just enroll this sunday sunday
153:48 - you're not showing the code or you're
153:49 - not sure what you're doing
153:50 - oops yeah yeah so guys what i was doing
153:53 - here is is i've done button
153:55 - from uh core so i've imported it from
153:58 - the core
153:59 - material ui library so you've got this
154:01 - we import it here
154:02 - go down here what i did is so get rid of
154:04 - this we had the search icon before
154:06 - what i'm doing now is instead i'm just
154:08 - going to do button
154:10 - so material ui button and then as the
154:12 - text will have the search icon
154:17 - nice nice now this would actually be a
154:19 - button
154:20 - there we go hey look at that here's a
154:23 - nice sort of
154:24 - you know outfill and then we can
154:25 - actually go ahead and actually make that
154:27 - variant an
154:27 - outline i think aaron is
154:31 - online i think maybe that would look
154:33 - like i would say just keep it normal
154:34 - i think it looks good like that no
154:36 - without without the outlet
154:39 - i mean if we get yeah i know you mean
154:42 - you know so
154:46 - let's leave it as let's give it a
154:48 - background gray you see like it's got
154:50 - that
154:50 - that's called gray color right because
154:52 - then if we check out that one it's got
154:54 - like a gray sort of tone to it
154:57 - yeah so let's go ahead and check that
155:00 - out and see so you got
155:02 - search um
155:06 - somewhere object fit contains and then
155:08 - there are emoji wash your hands
155:25 - what's up oh no we don't want to do that
155:27 - so let's just do class now
155:31 - and let's just do header search
155:40 - and here because we're actually applying
155:42 - a style to a
155:43 - material ui button we might actually
155:44 - have to do a special thing and in this
155:46 - case let's just do
155:47 - like gray but you have to do dash uh um
155:50 - exclamation mark important to override
155:53 - the rules
155:54 - so you see that then we get that yeah so
155:57 - light gray it's a bit too light but i
155:59 - mean at this point let's just get it
156:01 - started a bit more so it sort of looks
156:03 - along the right track yeah yeah yeah
156:05 - yeah so here we need to fix that height
156:07 - issue so the height issue here is
156:09 - because the outside container
156:11 - let's just say so right now the one that
156:14 - we're trying to get to
156:15 - is this right here right
156:18 - yeah which is the height of this one
156:20 - specifically is about like if you look
156:22 - at that
156:26 - maybe like 30 pixels well no no 20
156:29 - that's 25 30 30 that looks like it's 32
156:33 - pixels
156:34 - yeah so it's 30 pixels but then the
156:36 - border is pixel so yeah it's it's 30
156:38 - pixels height
156:39 - yeah so if we save that now you can see
156:44 - will it change i'm curious actually i'm
156:46 - i also have a
156:47 - i almost feel like it won't change yeah
156:50 - because i feel like
156:51 - the text filled right so this is
156:54 - interesting actually
156:55 - let's just double check
156:59 - because i think materiali has like a
157:01 - default height no
157:03 - yeah i think you're right yeah it's got
157:05 - some default stuff you see that like
157:07 - inside of it yeah it's got a lot of
157:09 - padding holy it's a lot of petting
157:11 - yeah you see that so we did apply the
157:13 - right and that looks like the right
157:14 - height right
157:15 - but what we can do now actually go in
157:16 - and inside here so we can get say class
157:18 - name
157:20 - class name of header and let's just call
157:22 - this one the header
157:24 - input
157:28 - and you can see why bem comes in handy
157:30 - here as well like
157:31 - you say padding of zero pixels important
157:38 - [Music]
157:44 - hmm
157:46 - i'm trying to figure out how to set the
157:47 - height of a text field
157:50 - i don't remember let's just mess around
157:51 - with it here so you see they've got
157:53 - display input min width vertical align
157:56 - flex direction
158:01 - so padding is zero you can say
158:05 - margin of zero maybe no well let's just
158:08 - say
158:08 - height of 30 pixels
158:14 - no i mean if you
158:17 - if you i think it's i think it's all
158:19 - from the padding if you remove so if you
158:21 - i think the reason why
158:22 - it's all from the padding that's coming
158:24 - oh right oh it's the actual
158:26 - input inside of it you see that yeah
158:28 - yeah yeah yeah yeah
158:29 - so i think we actually have to target
158:31 - the input so i think what we could do
158:32 - maybe
158:33 - actually i try no no no no go back go
158:35 - back go back sonny go back
158:37 - go back you see that you see you see has
158:41 - padding 18.5 pixels
158:44 - yeah so yeah see that it gets rid of it
158:48 - yeah but what we can do is yeah this is
158:50 - nested inside of material ui's classes
158:52 - we can target our header input and we
158:55 - can say
158:56 - i think you can do this right
158:59 - yeah yes you can yes you can and then oh
159:02 - god that's horrible
159:03 - um
159:08 - not i would say just put padding uh for
159:10 - like um
159:12 - like um top is like
159:16 - i've got 20 pixels oh that's huge um a
159:19 - lot yeah
159:20 - do like 10 or five
159:23 - oh no okay so it's good okay it's not
159:26 - bad
159:27 - it's not bad it's kind of there eight
159:30 - okay seven there you go keep it there
159:33 - i'm good with that yeah yeah okay so
159:37 - so we've got that roughly the button is
159:39 - needs to get like the right height as
159:40 - well
159:41 - so you can say here yeah the height here
159:43 - is a hundred so it's 33
159:45 - so we can just give the button a height
159:46 - of 33 sort of go perfectly now
159:48 - and i would say we also need to have
159:50 - like i have like a margin like like i
159:51 - might have margin right as well
159:53 - for the input because yeah looks like
159:56 - that input is not is not going to look
159:57 - exactly the same
159:59 - as that as the one that we have you mean
160:02 - yeah it's not gonna look exactly the
160:03 - same as that you know
160:05 - yeah we can make it look like the same
160:09 - but that's gonna that's gonna require
160:10 - custom css
160:12 - yeah i think for that we'll do we'll
160:13 - save it for the youtube clone where we
160:15 - go like
160:15 - yeah depth right like yeah let's just
160:18 - say 30 pixels or something like this
160:20 - oops no so it's not that wants to sit
160:22 - there here
160:26 - okay it's going to take a while so this
160:28 - is it for you
160:30 - okay there we go something like that for
160:31 - now nice
160:33 - yeah um for the right logos for now
160:36 - should we maybe go ahead and put
160:38 - something like
160:40 - um just the avatar
160:45 - on the right yeah but okay i mean you
160:48 - for example
160:49 - you can put you can put so hold on so on
160:51 - the right hand side
160:52 - you can just copy copy notifications
160:55 - logo put it in there
160:56 - copy a um what's it called you know and
160:59 - icon logo put it there and then put an
161:01 - avatar we could just use material ui
161:03 - right yes that's what i'm saying exactly
161:05 - oh yeah yeah yeah good good cool yeah so
161:07 - here we'll just do something like a
161:09 - an alert sort of bell or like a is it
161:11 - yes like something like this
161:14 - yeah no notification yeah there we go
161:16 - exactly that something like this
161:18 - like yeah exactly what i use
161:23 - so notifications icon and that can go
161:25 - here in the right side
161:28 - oops
161:32 - like that uh and then you can see in the
161:35 - right now we'll have the little bell
161:37 - um and then we can also have the sort of
161:41 - so let's go ahead and check so we've got
161:42 - the notification bell
161:44 - we've got the grid and we've got like a
161:46 - live right
161:47 - yeah so the grid can be like here we can
161:50 - say grid
161:52 - oh no oh okay you're nice yeah
161:55 - there you go the apps grid yeah so guys
161:58 - you can tell like because it's google
161:59 - you're going to get the exact icon set
162:01 - as well which is really nice yeah
162:03 - so that one came before that so we had
162:05 - this apps icon and then we also had
162:08 - oh oops i didn't show my code there guys
162:09 - i just added this apps icon
162:12 - to the the right side so we've got the
162:14 - apps icon and we've got the notification
162:16 - icon
162:17 - and then we also had the
162:20 - let's go ahead and check we've got the
162:22 - live icon right so
162:24 - i'm kind of live i i think it's okay
162:26 - that's actually like a video ad by the
162:28 - icons like a video but i think it's like
162:30 - a video icon
162:31 - there we go yeah nice
162:35 - so i got video call
162:38 - video call
162:44 - okay so we've got a video call oops
162:50 - nice so now we can see we should have
162:54 - all the icons okay but the video call
162:56 - came before and then we had an avatar at
162:58 - the end
162:58 - so that's pretty cool so we almost got
163:01 - there so
163:02 - now if we check out the youtube one so i
163:04 - mean
163:05 - at this point should we yeah okay so
163:07 - that's good yeah
163:11 - so i think this actually maybe focus on
163:13 - the functionality
163:15 - of so let's get rid of obviously the
163:16 - right logo that looks horrible
163:18 - so let's get rid of this big text here
163:22 - yep yep
163:25 - there we go nice nice nice nice
163:28 - yeah and i mean if they even have an
163:30 - avatar we could maybe just chuck that in
163:32 - there as a placeholder for now
163:35 - yeah i mean so hold on so if we if
163:37 - here's how we think about it so
163:39 - um how do we do this do we do we want to
163:42 - put now functionality into this were you
163:43 - actually clicking that that displays a
163:45 - model
163:46 - why do we want to do this or should we
163:47 - do this into like a part two what do you
163:48 - think
163:49 - i think maybe for this tutorial i mean
163:52 - uh
163:53 - maybe we should do so we should maybe we
163:55 - could maybe leave the sidebar as a
163:56 - sidebar or a placeholder yeah
163:58 - and we can maybe implement the modal
164:00 - functionality so that way we could
164:01 - demonstrate how you could have that
164:03 - inside so it's a thumbnail testing app
164:05 - so it's going to show roughly what it's
164:06 - going to look like
164:08 - and then we can put basically put in the
164:09 - dummy data but i think the actual
164:11 - the rest of the sort of you know like
164:12 - getting it to look exactly like youtube
164:14 - we can yeah
164:17 - yeah yeah so i would say let's focus on
164:19 - oh let's focus on the functionality
164:21 - or actually like bring up bringing up
164:23 - just a model you know
164:24 - and then uh is this going to work with
164:27 - firebase and actually saving this data
164:28 - or what
164:29 - no no so right now this is going to be
164:31 - all local just to sort of test what
164:32 - something would look like
164:34 - gotcha gotcha gotcha and then what we
164:36 - could do is actually so
164:37 - this is all sort of to show you guys
164:39 - sort of like you know like getting it
164:40 - set up getting everything sort of like
164:42 - up to this point and this and that like
164:43 - and there's sort of this sort of
164:45 - things that we experienced like when we
164:47 - ran into it
164:48 - and then what we can we could possibly
164:50 - like sort of finish it off and like this
164:51 - and
164:52 - then share the end result with you guys
164:53 - as well you know like it's sort of
164:55 - yeah and then the youtube clone would be
164:57 - like a complete build
164:58 - that we kind of go through yeah but but
165:00 - but i'm curious honey like if we if
165:02 - we're going to do like um
165:03 - um if we're going to do actual
165:06 - functionality of uploading like a
165:08 - thumbnail
165:09 - don't we still have to use like a
165:10 - firebase i know to upload to a
165:12 - like a a database so that we have a url
165:15 - to display an image
165:16 - no so i was thinking maybe literally we
165:18 - just had some kind of um
165:20 - uh buttons so literally like if you had
165:23 - imagine like a button here which says so
165:25 - imagine like
165:25 - on the third one right so like on say
165:28 - this let's say like here we said
165:30 - this one was is custom yeah
165:33 - so like this one is custom and then
165:36 - let's just go to video
165:37 - card and this accepts a is custom
165:41 - right okay and then what happens is if
165:44 - it's custom
165:44 - so let's go here and let's just show um
165:47 - so where we would normally have the
165:49 - thumbnail
165:51 - right here we can say if it's custom
165:55 - then have some stuff otherwise have
166:01 - oh so like just have a a basically a
166:04 - thumbnail a url that's like
166:06 - that's like different your that's a we
166:09 - we just give it a
166:10 - give a url image ourselves yeah like
166:13 - in this case you could we could maybe
166:14 - have like a but we will implement some
166:16 - functionality here but it'll be
166:17 - something like this it'll be like
166:19 - upload um thumbnail
166:22 - something along this line so something
166:24 - along this line of like
166:26 - so you see like it will say something
166:27 - like this upload thumbnail or like we'll
166:29 - be like a big square button or whatever
166:30 - and then it'll say like we click it
166:32 - it would open a file picker okay oh we
166:35 - could actually just do it as simple as
166:37 - that it would open a file
166:38 - picker and then that would give you the
166:39 - arrow
166:41 - oh and that will give us the url to your
166:43 - local machine
166:44 - yeah so this would be a local image that
166:47 - you can use to test out
166:49 - the um the thing right
166:53 - oh yeah i mean that go ahead well i
166:56 - think
166:56 - we could actually have it so that it
166:58 - pops up a a model saying enter a url
167:02 - yeah and then we could just maybe go
167:05 - then you can basically
167:06 - put any url in so you know like
167:09 - what do you think oh like any other
167:12 - image
167:13 - let's actually do that that would be
167:14 - easier yeah that's basically where it's
167:16 - like if it's a model you give it a url
167:19 - let's do that i think that'll be easier
167:20 - for now yeah what do you think yeah i
167:22 - think so too i think that'd be a nice
167:23 - and that will actually work quite nicely
167:25 - here
167:26 - yeah okay so in that case what we could
167:29 - do is
167:29 - um so
167:32 - that so basically what now only is a
167:34 - model right just a model
167:36 - yeah right uh and then a click of that
167:39 - model
167:40 - basically and then that model will need
167:42 - to pass
167:43 - back the url the url from the text field
167:46 - exactly and or url field exactly and
167:49 - luckily
167:50 - material ui has really nice modules so
167:53 - pretty much go ahead and copy
167:56 - this model right here so
167:59 - this needs state and a bunch of things
168:01 - so like here what we can do is i've used
168:03 - this model before
168:04 - uh to get it up and running nicely what
168:07 - we can just do is we can copy this bit
168:09 - so we just have a model so let's go back
168:10 - to our code
168:12 - so let's go into our video card so let's
168:15 - make this a bit clean
168:16 - and let's just have a bunch of save save
168:20 - save says oh my god so many cards okay
168:23 - so here so now what we can do is under
168:26 - before we actually have let's get rid of
168:27 - this comment so
168:29 - we can say const modal equals
168:32 - boom and this would be our model so like
168:35 - in a jss
168:36 - jsx or fragment yeah right
168:39 - and then guys we need a piece of state
168:40 - which is going to keep track of
168:42 - you know like if it's open or not so in
168:44 - react we have
168:45 - um sort of the react way of writing
168:49 - variables is through
168:50 - sort of uh through state so this is how
168:53 - you use the use state hook
168:55 - so you see here we can actually auto
168:57 - import it and basically this is how you
168:59 - set up a variable in react in like the
169:01 - react way
169:01 - we can say that okay right so we're
169:03 - saying we're actually creating a
169:04 - variable called open
169:06 - this is the the sort of function we call
169:08 - whenever we want to change what open is
169:11 - right so if you want to take the value
169:12 - of it we call this function and then it
169:14 - basically
169:15 - changes the value of it but then it
169:17 - re-renders everything in react
169:18 - way right yeah yeah and the initial
169:21 - value of that variable is false
169:23 - so that way we're telling it's billion
169:25 - as well nice nice nice
169:27 - and then that gets assigned here so that
169:29 - so the model will be open
169:30 - if this is true and then here
169:34 - on close what we can do is we need to
169:36 - write a function
169:37 - so const on close and this is a function
169:41 - which is basically just going to
169:43 - essentially just say
169:44 - it's like when you close we basically
169:46 - just want to set set open to false
169:50 - but that's where also we will save the
169:52 - url as well but that's going to be for
169:54 - later
169:55 - yes save url logic will go here yeah
169:58 - yeah
169:58 - and then we don't need this stuff right
170:01 - now the body
170:02 - of this stuff so if we go and check out
170:04 - what they have so
170:05 - in their demo they actually had
170:07 - something like this
170:09 - so they actually had some like sort of
170:11 - styling and this that but i think i mean
170:13 - we could use their styling like
170:16 - but i mean in our case we did we just
170:17 - want i mean we just want an input field
170:19 - to kind of pop up
170:21 - in text field right so we just we still
170:23 - have to specify the body is but we just
170:24 - just put in that we have to put a text
170:26 - field in their body
170:27 - oh yeah let's just use a div in the text
170:29 - field yes
170:30 - i'm saying yeah exactly yeah so here we
170:32 - can just say a sort of uh text field
170:34 - so text filled and we used the text
170:37 - field and what other what file was it it
170:38 - was um
170:40 - video it wasn't
170:42 - [Music]
170:44 - was it in the uh no no we're in video
170:46 - card it was in there oh no the text
170:48 - was it was in the search the search one
170:51 - so
170:52 - header yeah so this one here so
170:56 - we can go ahead and import that here
170:59 - so import text field and let's go ahead
171:01 - and do it here so
171:05 - text field and if we go
171:09 - over here you can see handle close is
171:10 - not defined
171:12 - so handle close oh yeah oh yeah because
171:16 - you have
171:16 - yeah to the same yeah and now
171:20 - if we go oh and there's going to be
171:22 - nothing which actually opens the um
171:24 - the uh okay so i can access mode okay so
171:26 - we haven't even brought in the model
171:28 - yeah so here what we need to do is we
171:30 - need to go ahead and say
171:32 - import modal from
171:37 - something like this modal
171:43 - and this should fix i think that's how
171:46 - you import the model
171:49 - okay so i think now the computer's
171:51 - starting to slowly die
171:54 - yeah it's like come on i know it's like
171:58 - oh you can do it
171:59 - help out here
172:04 - that's why the command that's why the
172:05 - command key is trying to chip away you
172:06 - know
172:07 - i know right oh right we're not actually
172:10 - using the moto i don't think
172:12 - so open is so modal
172:15 - yeah you have to click well don't we
172:17 - have to set open on the click of a
172:18 - certain something
172:20 - we do but i mean like this should be
172:22 - like we basically just pop the model
172:25 - there
172:26 - and then it should cannot access modal
172:29 - before initialization
172:30 - but where are we accessing modal before
172:31 - initializing it
172:33 - here hold on
172:44 - all right so in the return block we have
172:46 - mode
172:48 - your import model yeah you are module
172:51 - okay
172:52 - of course yeah because i'm actually
172:53 - calling it modo here as well right
172:56 - oh yeah yeah sure let's actually just
172:58 - use the the thing over here rather than
173:00 - having that
173:00 - yeah i'll do that but there's only a few
173:02 - lines of code so here we can say module
173:04 - there we go nice and then handle closes
173:06 - that nice
173:07 - that should be all good now so yeah
173:10 - there we go
173:11 - so now we will have is we'll have it
173:13 - when we click upload thumbnail it will
173:14 - open up that model
173:16 - right mm-hmm so i'm gonna do it
173:20 - so on click here what we can do is we
173:22 - can say
173:23 - e we can do an inline function we can
173:25 - just say set open to be true
173:28 - [Music]
173:30 - and now what we can do is if i go ahead
173:33 - and do
173:33 - upload thumbnail so you see it opens up
173:37 - in that corner
173:38 - a little text all right so i mean that's
173:41 - not ideal
173:42 - right now um oh yeah so how do you
173:46 - open the center so what we can do is
173:48 - they actually pass in a bunch of things
173:50 - they pass in um
173:52 - so their documentation says
173:56 - so let me go ahead and switch it to that
173:58 - so it says
173:59 - like a div so what we can do is just
174:01 - quickly go ahead and we'll copy in there
174:03 - sort of style
174:03 - roughly into our app so we have div and
174:06 - then that was exclusive
174:08 - and this actually means that so what
174:10 - they actually do here is you see like
174:12 - they've got this right here but then
174:14 - they've also got the sort of like
174:16 - modal style here so and the classes so
174:18 - we need these two things
174:20 - so right now i'm just going in and i'm
174:22 - basically going ahead and copying that
174:23 - inside here
174:25 - gotcha of course use styles and we need
174:29 - to do some imports and stuff like that
174:32 - and then what we're going to go ahead
174:33 - and do is basically i'm just going to go
174:34 - ahead and
174:36 - copy this pretty much
174:40 - block here so i mean we can refactor
174:42 - this but the point is that
174:44 - we're just kind of getting past this
174:46 - issue right now right now but
174:48 - when we did the full build we can pretty
174:49 - much go ahead and right now they're
174:51 - doing a random
174:53 - left and right you see that so we just
174:54 - want to be centered
174:56 - every time so we don't need the random
174:59 - because what they were doing is every
175:00 - time they clicked open modal
175:02 - that's so interesting it was popping in
175:04 - different spots to show like on the sort
175:06 - of demo
175:07 - how it can pop up yeah different areas
175:10 - but here what we can say is if we save
175:12 - it and we go back
175:14 - make styles is not defined because
175:18 - make styles is not defined
175:22 - on line 17 so it makes sense yeah
175:25 - that is true whereas make styles so we
175:27 - can import
175:29 - from a material ui core
175:32 - nice and now
175:36 - let's see just refresh
175:42 - and we can see
175:49 - come on come on hey
175:52 - now we have the little url okay cool
175:55 - so now we have okay so we have a search
175:57 - box and the only thing we probably need
175:58 - is like just a submit button or a submit
176:00 - button here that search text field but
176:02 - text field right exactly so at this
176:04 - point we have
176:05 - a text field but we can actually make
176:08 - this a bit more nicer we can actually
176:09 - just do a little form
176:11 - put the textbook inside of it like this
176:14 - have a button so a material ui button so
176:16 - i'm going to go ahead and pull in
176:18 - um or import material ui
176:22 - do this and we can say submit or we can
176:24 - say set image
176:27 - url yeah and then when we click that
176:30 - button
176:31 - we can actually so firstly if we set the
176:33 - type of this to submit
176:34 - then it will submit the form right oh
176:37 - really
176:38 - yeah so if you set the type of submit it
176:39 - means that you get that enter key
176:41 - behavior so you know when you're typing
176:42 - into the input field
176:44 - yeah yeah because it's all inside of a
176:46 - form you'll get that behavior by default
176:48 - so
176:48 - remember when we type into this field
176:52 - so when we type into the upload uh when
176:54 - that field pops up we actually need to
176:55 - keep track of what we're typing
176:57 - so a quick way of doing that is we need
176:59 - to keep a piece of state to keep track
177:01 - of what's inside there so here we can
177:02 - say input text
177:05 - yeah or in this case it's actually the
177:06 - image url i guess
177:08 - yeah and then set set image url
177:11 - exactly set image url so here what we
177:13 - can do is and then by default
177:15 - it's i mean you could set a placeholder
177:17 - i mean now we leave it as blank for now
177:19 - image url um and then what we can do is
177:22 - we can go ahead and say here that the
177:24 - value
177:25 - is the image url and the on
177:28 - change so every time you sort of type in
177:30 - something we're going to say
177:32 - set image url to be e
177:38 - [Music]
177:39 - every time we type inside that text
177:41 - field it's going to update the our state
177:43 - the image url state
177:44 - oh okay see yeah and then on the on here
177:48 - we need to do is on click we need to do
177:50 - handle close
177:52 - right because when you click that button
177:55 - handle close and then
177:56 - that's also where we basically do our
177:58 - sort of um i mean actually at this point
178:00 - we don't even need the
178:02 - we actually are saving yeah yeah we're
178:05 - actually doing it as we do it there
178:07 - so um okay so at this point what we can
178:09 - do is
178:10 - upload thumbnail so we can actually go
178:13 - ahead and click on upload thumbnail
178:16 - and you can see like here so now let's
178:17 - just say we were to grab
178:19 - so let's just say abc and we set image
178:21 - url so now
178:22 - in our state it would actually be abc
178:25 - and actually it would be i know okay so
178:26 - this is actually something interesting
178:28 - now so
178:30 - when we do this right yeah we don't
178:33 - actually i think what we should do at
178:35 - this point is we should set we should
178:36 - have a piece of state for the input
178:39 - yeah so set input reason being is
178:41 - because if you do it like that
178:43 - then it's actually going to dynamically
178:45 - change the background before you've even
178:47 - clicked submit
178:49 - the way we're going to do it yeah yeah
178:51 - so yeah
178:52 - instead of unchanged you would do on
178:54 - input or like on submit right
178:57 - yeah so we actually need another piece
178:58 - of state for the image
179:00 - so we have one for the input and one for
179:02 - the image the reason being it makes
179:04 - sense in a second but like if we do it
179:06 - like
179:06 - this um so the input would be one
179:10 - but do you even need
179:15 - oh no you're right you're uh well i mean
179:17 - can you can you just
179:18 - simply just pass in uh can you just
179:20 - simply pass in a value from the text
179:22 - field
179:23 - into a function you
179:27 - like the e target the value right so
179:29 - look so let's check this out look if
179:31 - you're inside here look
179:32 - right you target the value basically
179:36 - oh you don't have that because you only
179:38 - can you can only do on submit
179:39 - you're right you're right yeah yeah
179:43 - yeah gotcha so from my understanding
179:45 - just just like if i understand
179:46 - like if if we go back to videocard.js my
179:49 - understanding what's going to happen is
179:50 - this so the text field right here
179:52 - as you type it's going to save the input
179:55 - text right
179:56 - yeah but the actual image url is going
179:58 - to be saved only
179:59 - once you hit the button exactly
180:03 - right so once you hit once you hit the
180:05 - button hey submit
180:06 - then the new url is going to be set as
180:08 - as sunny is typing right now
180:11 - and then we're going to use the image
180:12 - url to finally
180:14 - show um on the front page exactly
180:17 - yeah yeah and then what we also need to
180:19 - do is because we're using a form here
180:21 - we need to actually say that it gets an
180:23 - event when you submit and you need to
180:24 - say e dot prevent default
180:26 - otherwise it refreshes the page and then
180:28 - react we hate refreshes
180:30 - yeah right so we have to do that so now
180:33 - with this said
180:34 - what it should do is it will actually
180:35 - set it'll set the image url and then
180:37 - it'll set open to false but
180:38 - we're not actually using the image url
180:40 - anywhere so
180:41 - remember here we actually said if it's
180:43 - custom then this right so
180:45 - here what we could do is we could say if
180:46 - it's custom and there is no image url
180:50 - then show that upload thumbnail or like
180:53 - so let's just say a select thumbnail
180:54 - just say select thumbnail
180:56 - right and then what would happen is it
180:58 - would show this in the beginning so
181:00 - image url is not defined so
181:02 - image or interesting imagery is not
181:04 - defined
181:06 - image url okay image url did you
181:09 - spell it wrong yeah yeah it looks like
181:12 - yeah
181:13 - so now we need to do that and we can see
181:16 - okay so now if we do select
181:17 - in sec thumbnail let me do this and then
181:21 - here if i go
181:22 - to um oh oh my god was i not sharing the
181:24 - screen the entire time
181:27 - no you're you're just sharing you're
181:28 - sharing the code oh you're fine
181:30 - oh yeah i'm good yeah yeah okay yeah
181:32 - you're fine yeah so now
181:34 - let's go ahead and find like a um a
181:37 - thumbnail so let's go ahead and type in
181:40 - thumbnail i know
181:43 - i've been in situations too where like
181:45 - i'm showing something like i zoom
181:47 - i'm like and they're like what are you
181:48 - showing us i'm like oh
181:50 - yeah and then yeah oh damn it i don't
181:52 - know where that was yeah
181:53 - or some dodgy picture comes up
181:56 - so there's the copy image your address
181:58 - so now
181:59 - what we can do hopefully is if we go
182:01 - here and i do this
182:04 - so we do okay so actually this may not
182:05 - work so if i do set image url
182:07 - so you see that okay so that's right
182:09 - that is right but
182:10 - what it actually did there is it
182:13 - so it did render it because the
182:15 - condition was no longer true so it
182:16 - rendered this one
182:17 - but the source here right so what we
182:20 - actually changed
182:21 - yeah we need to say first check if the
182:23 - image url exists
182:25 - otherwise do we need to check check
182:29 - yeah because the reason why is because
182:32 - what's happening now is that it it
182:33 - it's basically it's saying it was custom
182:36 - so it showed the button
182:37 - and there was no image so it showed that
182:38 - oh that makes sense yeah
182:40 - and afterwards render out the firstly
182:42 - check if there is an imager which would
182:44 - only be present if it was custom
182:46 - uh otherwise just show a thumbnail url
182:49 - god just makes sense here yeah yeah yeah
182:52 - so now
182:53 - let's go ahead and click select let's
182:55 - try it
182:58 - whenever we do this and we do paste and
183:00 - we do set image url hey
183:02 - look at that hey would you look at that
183:06 - nice nice nice ratio and stuff like
183:10 - that's messed up but i think what we can
183:12 - do here is we can actually set the
183:14 - height of the you know that the
183:15 - height of it correctly yeah we can do
183:18 - yeah usually usually like what i would
183:21 - do is like i would have like a
183:22 - background image like i would set the
183:24 - div like a creative with a specific
183:26 - height and then you have like a
183:27 - background image
183:28 - yeah um which is like which is like what
183:31 - which will fit the
183:32 - the div right but but you know
183:35 - i think yeah i know i know in my case
183:38 - in this case like what we could do
183:40 - honestly honestly honestly though
183:42 - sunny this doesn't matter because here's
183:44 - the thing when you
183:45 - when you're going to test out a
183:46 - thumbnail your thumbnail image
183:48 - you are going to have the exact same
183:50 - aspect ratio yeah so you just have to
183:51 - yeah you have to make sure
183:53 - because you're not going to upload an
183:54 - image that's a different aspect ratio
183:56 - there we go like that right exactly yeah
183:58 - yeah yeah
184:00 - and then i guess like even for like the
184:01 - test video i mean like this stuff
184:03 - we could we we we could include in the
184:06 - module i guess
184:09 - um in oh like uh the the actual like
184:13 - submit stuff
184:14 - is in the text yeah
184:17 - yeah i mean we could just do like a
184:18 - title if you want to do a title really
184:20 - quickly
184:21 - just another just another use state
184:24 - another use state and uh uh and a title
184:28 - yeah so so we'll do text field so we
184:30 - could do is we could do const
184:32 - and here we could say uh time and this
184:34 - one can i
184:35 - can i actually try this one yeah go
184:37 - actually try this one you do it okay
184:38 - so okay so so we have so we're going to
184:41 - create a title basically right
184:42 - yeah and now we're going to have it
184:44 - you're going to use use state so that we
184:45 - can
184:45 - save that title yeah you stay and by
184:48 - default we're going to basically just
184:50 - be nothing right well can we actually
184:52 - have a
184:53 - can we actually have a default be like a
184:55 - test title
184:57 - um so remember this one isn't going to
184:59 - be shown
185:00 - because we're only going to check we're
185:02 - only going to we we need some kind of
185:04 - what if what what if we do show it
185:05 - though
185:07 - oh we because we're just gonna change
185:10 - all of the ones remember we need
185:11 - something oh yeah yeah that's true
185:13 - that's true so it's just gonna be an
185:14 - empty string got it got it got that's
185:15 - true
185:16 - got it so i'm gonna save that that's
185:17 - fine then i'm going to go to the text
185:19 - field and i'm going to
185:21 - oh are you following me yep oh no i'm
185:23 - not okay um okay
185:26 - let's go yeah yeah text field i'm going
185:29 - to copy this text field now
185:31 - and then i'm just going to create
185:32 - another one right
185:34 - except in this one the value of this one
185:37 - is going to be
185:38 - actually i need to create another one
185:40 - which is going to be in
185:41 - a title input right yeah to be fair i
185:44 - mean
185:45 - for the title yeah but you're right yeah
185:47 - oh input yeah
185:48 - let's keep it consistent yeah set title
185:53 - input right right equals
185:56 - use state yeah we're also going to set
185:59 - that to nothing
186:00 - okay so save that let's go ahead and do
186:03 - that let's go back to textview we're
186:04 - going to say the title input for this
186:06 - one right so title input because we want
186:08 - to
186:08 - keep track of the title as you are
186:11 - typing
186:12 - and then we will do set title input
186:15 - right
186:15 - set title input beautiful
186:19 - okay so that's going to be that that's
186:21 - going to be that uh
186:23 - let's go just say this and see how this
186:24 - how this how this looks like so if we
186:26 - save that
186:29 - yep so and save that and then yeah and
186:32 - open it inside identify title oh okay
186:35 - remember our prop was actually called
186:37 - title
186:38 - oh okay okay okay so hold on so we're
186:41 - gonna we're gonna say
186:42 - um uh thumb thumb
186:46 - title like this we could do thumbtail
186:48 - yeah
186:49 - yeah set
186:53 - thumb title
186:58 - i know i know it sounds weird i know i
187:00 - know man
187:03 - we'll just keep us that we'll keep it in
187:05 - the title input okay and then title
187:06 - input there we go and that's fine all
187:08 - right so save that
187:09 - yeah you need to refactor your your um
187:13 - your variables the ones that are using
187:15 - so yeah
187:17 - so oh this is the same that one's good
187:19 - yeah so but in the handle close you need
187:21 - to actually use your
187:23 - thumb title right yeah yeah yeah but not
187:25 - yet
187:26 - i just want to see how it looks like for
187:27 - now okay yeah yeah so now what we can do
187:29 - is we can save that
187:30 - and then we go back and here
187:36 - see nice okay so
187:39 - this is actually so that we've got two
187:41 - things here but because it's in it's
187:43 - like
187:43 - defaulting it to a row you see that so
187:45 - we should add like a placeholder right
187:47 - yeah like a placeholder exactly yeah so
187:50 - let's do that right now so i'm going to
187:51 - say
187:51 - text field placeholder yeah for this one
187:54 - and this is just going to be like um
187:58 - image url like this right
188:01 - and the placeholder for this one
188:05 - is going to be title exactly
188:08 - all right so save that okay yep so save
188:12 - that
188:12 - let's go over here and now refresh
188:18 - let's go select thumbnail and we should
188:23 - hey nice all right sweet sweet sweet so
188:26 - we kind of got it it's not it's not
188:27 - fancy but it's fine but it works
188:29 - yeah okay so then
188:32 - on clothes on a close all we have to do
188:34 - guys is simply
188:36 - we do set set um
188:39 - set title set title right now set thumb
188:42 - set set thumb title right yeah
188:47 - title and we will and guys in the
188:50 - comments below
188:51 - which one would we use in terms of the
188:52 - input which one would you use
188:54 - well we would use this one because
188:56 - that's the one that is being changed by
188:58 - the actual
188:59 - input right as you as you type you're
189:01 - going to say title input
189:04 - right there right there boom
189:07 - and so now we actually have to use that
189:09 - in our jsx
189:11 - okay exactly so here's our title so what
189:13 - do we do in this case
189:14 - so we'll so we will say basically it's
189:16 - either basically
189:18 - but we can do a few things either we do
189:20 - it like this so we say
189:21 - um thumb title what do i say
189:25 - can i get a suggestions thumb title yeah
189:28 - or
189:29 - oh wait wait no or title like this right
189:32 - yep
189:33 - we just do like that you do that yeah
189:35 - because by default it would be uh
189:37 - it'll be commas right it'll be like
189:38 - blank uh yeah
189:40 - yeah yeah so if we go now to
189:44 - we now take a look at what's going on
189:48 - so let's try it again so it's like demo
189:51 - image
189:51 - [Music]
189:53 - this one let's just do yo
189:55 - [Music]
189:57 - set image hey there we go hey would you
190:00 - look at that
190:01 - nice oh dang that's it and that's nice
190:04 - and like wait
190:05 - that would basically be repeated for the
190:08 - rest of it so we would repeat that here
190:10 - we'd repeat that here we'd repeat that
190:12 - for this right
190:13 - yeah and then we'd essentially get like
190:16 - and that's actually pretty cool that's
190:17 - actually really handy
190:18 - like uh yeah and then like
190:22 - when we actually make a full youtube
190:24 - clone we can implement the functionality
190:26 - of this
190:27 - into the youtube clone right and so now
190:29 - you have a full youtube code that looks
190:30 - exactly like youtube
190:32 - yeah by not but you add the
190:33 - functionality of selecting a thumbnail
190:35 - to it
190:35 - voila that would be dope
190:39 - right really nice yeah that'd be super
190:41 - cool man and then that would mean that
190:42 - like we'd literally have the actual
190:44 - youtube clone
190:45 - with the thumbnail and now we've already
190:47 - figured out how to do the thumbnail
190:49 - stuff so yeah now like just to show you
190:50 - guys again because that's really cool
190:52 - that's really really nice like here like
190:54 - if we do this and then we say like let's
190:56 - just say like
190:57 - uh let's build oops yeah so in this case
190:59 - we'd style this bit but it'll say let's
191:01 - build an app
191:03 - and then we do this and you see that
191:04 - let's build an app nice
191:07 - nice okay nice and then in that case
191:09 - what we would end up having guys
191:11 - is literally a case of we would go ahead
191:14 - and build out the rest of this stuff
191:16 - so imagine like we would have the rest
191:19 - of this so you can actually see like
191:20 - look at the transition there like we're
191:22 - actually getting there like you see that
191:23 - we saw yeah
191:24 - it was pretty we're not far guys give us
191:26 - some fire for this like sir guys give us
191:28 - some fire in the comments below because
191:30 - look at this i mean it's pretty i mean
191:31 - okay i know it's not perfect
191:32 - yeah we
191:36 - still got some good styling to do but
191:37 - it's almost there exactly and guys
191:40 - the one thing i will say is that usually
191:42 - it's like it's very well put like
191:43 - pre-prepared but this was like
191:45 - completely from scratch so this was like
191:48 - a complete from scratch that we just was
191:50 - running through this and we were showing
191:51 - you like
191:52 - as we were comparing against youtube so
191:55 - a lot of the other sort of videos we
191:56 - have like sort of prepared things
191:57 - beforehand and we sort of run through
191:58 - code and this and that boys
192:00 - in this case it was a real demonstration
192:01 - of actually like running through it with
192:04 - us as we built something so it kind of
192:06 - gives you guys some reality
192:07 - as to how actually how real builds go
192:10 - when you actually do this stuff
192:11 - and you can see like in terms of
192:13 - actually similarities
192:14 - like it's very very it's getting there
192:16 - in terms of like obviously it's not bad
192:18 - at all
192:18 - imagine the sidebar was sort of uh
192:20 - pushed into it as well like you'd have
192:22 - quite a lot
192:23 - already here that's looking similar
192:24 - right yeah
192:26 - that's always like literally like
192:27 - literally we're not we're not far off i
192:29 - mean yeah
192:30 - i mean there's there's some styling you
192:31 - have to do and stuff like that but
192:33 - once we get that we're good man nice i
192:36 - said should we maybe take questions now
192:38 - what do you think knows
192:39 - yeah let's take some questions if you
192:40 - guys have any questions let us know if
192:42 - you got any questions you know
192:44 - development related uh you know life
192:46 - related and just nothing personal life
192:48 - related maybe well we'll see
192:49 - yeah i haven't uh let me get your
192:53 - uh instagram handle on us so that way
192:55 - like maybe we can
192:56 - we can just end it off with a nice
192:58 - little you know finisher
193:00 - yeah because let me get your insta up
193:01 - here so nice
193:04 - so guys yes shoot us your questions down
193:07 - below
193:08 - and we can pretty much answer anything
193:10 - that you guys want to ask yeah
193:11 - and if you guys get any ideas for what
193:13 - you guys want us to build
193:14 - next let us know in the comments below
193:17 - as well
193:18 - and like obviously we want to obviously
193:20 - we're here to build we're here to teach
193:21 - and we're here to build with you guys so
193:24 - you know just let us know we'll try to
193:26 - figure it out you know
193:27 - maybe you want to build a machine
193:28 - learning system who knows exactly yeah
193:30 - you guys might want to build that like
193:32 - i see a lot of people actually asking
193:34 - for like machine learning stuff so no
193:36 - literally sunny we should do it
193:37 - we should use tensorflow js honestly
193:40 - yeah
193:41 - like we we could do that yeah we should
193:43 - that'd be dope like
193:44 - and i think you can actually use uh
193:48 - tensorflow models uh with firebase
193:51 - yeah and then there's really cool thing
193:53 - actually maybe i can send you this video
193:55 - this guy and maybe you can probably
193:56 - maybe you can you can show this actually
193:58 - hold on
193:59 - where is this there's a really cool
194:00 - video showing tensorflow how you can
194:02 - crop a person out you can build a using
194:04 - javascript you can build
194:06 - you can build this cool thing yeah it
194:09 - will call a person now and put them in a
194:10 - different setting
194:11 - oh nice really yeah yeah hold on maybe i
194:14 - can show it to you for everybody to see
194:15 - as well
194:16 - while everybody's typing any questions
194:18 - it's just so cool man
194:20 - oh that's somebody just dropped slack
194:22 - clone
194:24 - oh that's i never thought of a slack
194:27 - clone yeah so steve mccarthy said a
194:29 - second that's a
194:30 - that's a really nice idea like didn't
194:32 - even look at that that would be
194:33 - and that would be really cool to build
194:34 - with firebase actually um
194:38 - so radam says i am late for the live
194:41 - session mayor come in
194:42 - [Laughter]
194:46 - yes okay don you may come in yeah
194:52 - that is hilarious yeah so as few people
194:54 - say it's huge use tensorflow so
194:56 - um guys in case you're wondering what
194:58 - tensorflow is while nars is finding his
195:00 - video so
195:01 - tensorflow is like a it's a here is a
195:03 - website it's an end-to-end open source
195:04 - machine learning platform
195:06 - it's very popular and essentially like
195:08 - it's a way so
195:09 - machine learning works in a way
195:11 - basically you train models right you
195:13 - train models and basically
195:15 - what happens is you have some input that
195:17 - goes into the model
195:18 - like imagine like a box in the middle
195:20 - right that's the model that takes the
195:22 - input
195:22 - basically determines so i'm not going to
195:24 - go into how machine learning
195:26 - really works down to like a nearby level
195:29 - but like it basically take that input
195:31 - and it will give you some kind of output
195:32 - which you can use
195:33 - and in in some cases it'll be like is
195:35 - this a face
195:36 - or is this not a face right yeah is this
195:39 - is this sort of a person or is this not
195:41 - a person
195:42 - and those models the way you train them
195:44 - and the way it sort of works like
195:46 - platforms like tensorflow are sort of
195:49 - very reusable sort of
195:50 - uh sort of platforms to use and they're
195:52 - very good when it comes to sort of like
195:54 - a lot of production companies use things
195:56 - like tensorflow and um i think firebase
195:58 - use them as well
196:00 - yeah yeah a lot i think i can find it
196:04 - i think you can find it
196:07 - a lot of people think yes machine
196:09 - learning
196:10 - definitely that's not really learning
196:12 - yes so
196:14 - facebook clone somebody said we actually
196:16 - went ahead and built um
196:18 - not a facebook clone as such but we
196:20 - built a uh facebook messenger app so if
196:22 - you guys are interested in that
196:23 - definitely go check that out
196:24 - it's a real-time facebook messenger app
196:26 - which is really really nice
196:28 - um so so evil namekian says why
196:32 - why do you need css when you have a web
196:34 - design in web development
196:36 - so css is everything underneath
196:40 - what git what allows you to have some
196:42 - kind of design in web development
196:44 - um so yeah so you you need
196:47 - css is so web dev consists of three
196:50 - things html css javascript
196:52 - css is what makes it look pretty that's
196:54 - why it's why we got the app looking the
196:55 - way it looked
196:57 - um even though it wasn't the most
196:58 - previous
197:01 - we tried our best for the time we had
197:03 - exactly like in terms of like yeah guys
197:05 - like we
197:05 - built that from scratch from the get-go
197:07 - um yeah yeah and at the same point like
197:10 - when you're
197:10 - so this is one thing i do want to sort
197:12 - of stress like no do you find that like
197:14 - so a lot of people talk about flow state
197:17 - right
197:18 - like when you're sort of coding and
197:20 - you're going to flow i definitely go
197:21 - into a sort of flow state when i'm sort
197:22 - of coding i'm like
197:23 - if if i'm sort of like even when i'm
197:25 - pair programming or doing something
197:27 - you your speed like there's this
197:29 - trade-offs guys because like pair
197:31 - programming like you're going to learn
197:32 - new things right you're going to learn
197:33 - things and shortcuts and things like
197:35 - that you didn't know but when you sort
197:36 - of code
197:37 - a lot and you get used to like sort of
197:39 - cutting yourself you can actually do a
197:40 - lot by yourself in some areas and like
197:42 - when you sort of
197:43 - tend to sort of like a lot of people
197:44 - would just chuck on some music and start
197:46 - coding
197:47 - then like you'll sort of get into a flow
197:48 - state and like you could actually sort
197:50 - of go crazy and like
197:51 - i actually built the netflix app really
197:54 - fast like i was shocked like the netflix
197:55 - app the sort of youtube clone
197:57 - i know youtube cloned them the instagram
197:59 - phone like you can go into those sort of
198:01 - like very focused states so
198:02 - but when we're sort of live streaming
198:04 - and we're talking and we're explaining
198:06 - it yeah it will take a longer time yeah
198:08 - yeah but guys yeah
198:10 - freaking sunny build an amazing netflix
198:12 - school so just i just want to say like
198:14 - give sonny a round of applause in the
198:15 - comments because he just killed it
198:18 - it's just so good and it looks good and
198:21 - literally you cannot even compare it
198:22 - like i mean
198:23 - you can barely tell the difference
198:24 - between like netflix clown you know and
198:26 - the real netflix so
198:27 - yeah but awesome what about that man
198:30 - this one right here netflix clown so
198:33 - this was a
198:33 - fun project dude like i remember like i
198:36 - literally just like
198:37 - cause he was like yo like maybe we
198:38 - should build netflix gun and i was like
198:40 - okay
198:41 - like and then i was like okay let me see
198:42 - if there's like a a movie api library
198:44 - and i just sort of like
198:46 - threw on some music and before you know
198:47 - it this thing
198:57 - oh man and you guys love him
199:00 - maybe we should just make him netflix
199:01 - competitor you know yeah exactly yeah
199:04 - maybe i should just do that
199:06 - by the way sonny i sent you a video
199:08 - stupid video of the tensorflow thing
199:09 - take a look at it
199:10 - and slack check it out so real time
199:14 - uh teleportation in so let me see if i
199:16 - can get this up
199:17 - it might not be the smoothest for
199:18 - everyone but let's go ahead and see like
199:22 - okay so you see that so like so look
199:25 - he's a so he's so checked out he's
199:27 - actually in his room right there right
199:29 - he's in his room
199:30 - the is cutting him out and
199:34 - putting him on a different phone look at
199:36 - that oh
199:37 - damn so he's so the the camera is
199:40 - actually in his room and it's just him
199:41 - dancing
199:42 - but it's putting him in a different
199:44 - location it will where he's just simply
199:46 - using his uh his phone
199:48 - that's insane so that guys can you see
199:50 - yeah like literally this is the video
199:51 - feed right
199:52 - it gets fed into like a tensorflow model
199:55 - like so and then they basically crop out
199:57 - this image
199:58 - and then it's rendering him or it's like
200:00 - projecting him
200:02 - onto a different camera right or
200:04 - something or like
200:05 - i went to reality yeah i went to the
200:07 - reality yeah damn that's insane
200:09 - guys who wants us to build that let us
200:12 - know in the comments below that would i
200:14 - think that would be cool man that would
200:16 - be cool yeah
200:17 - oh yeah let's do that freaking building
200:19 - august in reality
200:21 - yeah and this guy built it pretty pretty
200:23 - recently this was in april 20th oh damn
200:26 - yep yep yep awesome so we have a few
200:29 - yeah
200:30 - a lot of fun nice you guys are awesome
200:33 - can't wait to finish coding them all oh
200:35 - thank you very much
200:37 - yeah and guys if you enjoyed this like
200:39 - shoot an instagram story post it for us
200:41 - we love to have conversations with you
200:43 - guys
200:43 - yeah instagram tags are over here and
200:46 - nazis is over there
200:49 - it's always such a hard like i'm always
200:50 - pointing at my mic and i'm like it's
200:53 - that one right there there you go
200:56 - okay maybe you're right measures go like
200:58 - this yeah oh actually i think honestly
201:00 - that's the easiest way just to point to
201:01 - your mic
201:02 - you know what no i feel like i've got my
201:04 - stream deck in the perfect position if i
201:06 - point at it
201:07 - it just looks like it
201:16 - that's hilarious man so yeah guys tag us
201:18 - on your instagram you know let us know
201:19 - what else you want to see from us
201:20 - and you know we'll be happy to build
201:22 - some more stuff this is what we're here
201:24 - to do
201:25 - hola kunlei says you guys are amazing we
201:28 - appreciate you guys
201:29 - we love you guys and the support you
201:31 - guys give us
201:32 - um steve mccarthy says you'll spend
201:34 - you'll spend weeks training the model
201:36 - so you know like this is the thing guys
201:39 - like a lot of tensorflow and like
201:41 - and even firebase actually they have
201:43 - models
201:44 - that you can go and just use right they
201:46 - have more years which have been
201:47 - pre-trained on like
201:48 - on god knows how much they are um
201:51 - they're probably
201:52 - constantly improving as well because
201:53 - models do require
201:55 - huge amounts of data um and then yeah
201:58 - like it
201:59 - you can pretty much use stuff on
202:00 - tensorflow you use stuff on firebase and
202:02 - they save you that hassle so
202:04 - yeah so sunny some somebody asked a
202:07 - question here do you play chess
202:09 - oh okay this one's on first so evil
202:11 - namekian says do you play
202:13 - i do play chess probably not do you play
202:15 - chess
202:16 - wait what wait you play chess i mean i
202:18 - i'm not a professional i mean i wouldn't

203:14 - were you guys doing it i think i was
203:15 - like i just saw a chessboard and you had
203:17 - nars i was like
203:17 - what the hell is happening
203:21 - yeah yeah so that was really funny
203:25 - troy mitchell dropped a nice comment he
203:26 - says you guys blew the doors off all
203:28 - learning platforms great
203:30 - jobs love that thank you troy are you
203:33 - are you in profit javascript by the way
203:35 - oh yeah troy yeah oh we should mention
203:37 - have we mentioned that at all here

203:40 - mentioned it but guys if you find
203:42 - if you find any of the live streams uh
203:44 - useful or like literally like
203:47 - any of the content that we talk about
203:48 - useful like
203:50 - for example troy in this case like then
203:52 - definitely
203:53 - is worth going and checking out the
203:55 - course that we offer so you you're
203:56 - pretty much going to get the following
203:58 - so let's go ahead and show them what
203:59 - profit javascript's all about
204:02 - yeah guys it's beginner friendly so you
204:04 - guys don't need any experience
204:06 - if you've never coded before it's
204:07 - completely fine um
204:09 - nero i think yeah nero is actually
204:11 - inside the course herself
204:12 - so yeah nars and some amazing coaches in
204:15 - pwj
204:16 - lucky to learn from them thank you very
204:17 - much guys and like we have
204:19 - 15 like javascript modules which take
204:21 - you completely from beginner
204:22 - to a very sort of like a comfortable
204:24 - level at the point which you can pretty
204:25 - much go from landing your first clients
204:27 - and jobs
204:28 - um talk about the sort of the the
204:30 - additional stuff we offer
204:33 - yeah i mean guys i mean but i mean guys
204:35 - it's pretty simple guys
204:36 - you know this is not something here that
204:39 - you're going to be
204:39 - simply just watching videos right you've
204:41 - got the support of you know a community
204:43 - of 1500 members so for example we have a
204:45 - slack community
204:46 - with 1500 members where all the students
204:48 - kind of come in
204:49 - right at this point it's 15. it's not
204:51 - 13.52 it's basically it's 1500 students
204:53 - guys really
204:55 - 1500 students seriously everybody's in
204:58 - there everybody's helping each other out
205:00 - right answering questions anything on
205:03 - top of that what do you got you got a
205:04 - weekly coaching course but you know
205:06 - sunny amazing sunny and nas like me

205:13 - us right and we basically we teach you
205:16 - guys every single week we teach you you
205:17 - know
205:18 - the bare bones of of of coding we teach

205:23 - we teach you how to go ahead and
205:25 - actually do your resume
205:26 - we teach you you know all the skills

205:34 - first
205:35 - job as a developer right so if that's
205:37 - something you're interested in what
205:38 - if you're actually interested in being
205:40 - coached by people who've been
205:42 - in your you know who've been developers

207:41 - like it's very simple exactly we're
207:42 - always jumping on com like calls with
207:44 - whether somebody's got an interview they
207:45 - need help preparing with
207:47 - uh whenever somebody's got a client and
207:49 - they don't know how to handle a
207:50 - situation
207:51 - it's so one to one it's ridiculous like
207:54 - we also have um
207:55 - evil namekian says profitable javascript
207:57 - helps computer science students too
207:59 - so does it yes yeah i mean i mean i was
208:02 - a computer science student guys
208:03 - right of course if you could be a
208:05 - science student what's what's your goal
208:07 - like
208:08 - evil evil i feel i'm gonna say i'm gonna
208:11 - say evil
208:12 - if your goal is to become a developer
208:14 - right you know the main thing the main
208:16 - thing that would you that you will
208:17 - probably don't have you probably don't
208:19 - have
208:19 - in college right now is you probably and
208:22 - you know let me know if you're if i'm
208:23 - writing this
208:24 - is you probably don't have the actual
208:26 - real world experience that you need
208:28 - you're probably learning a lot of theory
208:30 - you're probably you know
208:31 - learning a lot from a lot of theater
208:33 - from all your professors right but
208:34 - you're not actually building projects
208:36 - you're not actually doing a lot of real
208:37 - world
208:38 - yeah so what we do is if we flip it
208:40 - around in that course
208:41 - we flip it around to a point where all
208:43 - your dual not all but most of what
208:45 - you're doing
208:46 - is real world you're building projects
208:48 - every single module
208:50 - well building projects from scratch
208:51 - where we are teaching you how to do
208:53 - something
208:53 - from the beginning from just an idea and
208:56 - how to build it out
208:57 - to a reality exactly because that is
208:59 - something that a lot of students don't
209:00 - know what to do because they're confused
209:01 - about that
209:02 - and that is what we do with every single
209:04 - project from exactly idea
209:06 - to reality exactly and guys and you will
209:09 - not have better energy like nasa's
209:11 - coaching course
209:12 - are just now how do your coaching goals
209:14 - end every time like the energy every
209:16 - time guys
209:16 - the coaching calls and with a dance
209:18 - party exactly
209:20 - it's insane i've never even my coaching
209:22 - course like everyone's like yo
209:24 - can we have a dance session i'm like oh
209:25 - my god i don't know how noise gets this
209:27 - energy
209:28 - but like that's the kind of energy that
209:30 - is in pwj guys like that kind of like
209:32 - you know love and and sort of like
209:34 - growth with the community like
209:35 - steve mccarty says sunny i'll join your
209:37 - slack to help out answering questions
209:39 - as a cto for a med tech company in 35
209:42 - years and steve
209:43 - actually is always on the live course so
209:45 - uh yeah we could we could probably bring
209:47 - him in yeah definitely
209:48 - that we'll be yeah yeah we'll talk we'll
209:49 - talk with kazi yeah we'll talk with kazi
209:51 - yeah that'd be awesome cool uh we've got
209:54 - near okay says success coaches are
209:56 - preparing content for beginners
209:58 - you have an amazing community to help
209:59 - you out they make you feel like don't
210:00 - worry we got you
210:02 - that's something i love i love that
210:03 - comment yeah thank you nero
210:05 - yeah it's really really nice um yeah so
210:09 - we have a few
210:10 - some of the guys how do you handle seo
210:12 - issues on computer science
210:13 - troy troy i see you in the comments i
210:15 - want to see you in pwj come on let's go
210:18 - let's do it what are you waiting for
210:19 - troy
210:19 - i see you exactly i see you jump in dude
210:23 - jump in i'm currently in that
210:24 - say like yeah so troy that's actually a
210:26 - really interesting so he's currently a
210:27 - net developer at work
210:29 - and now yeah so troy did you know that
210:32 - react is the most
210:33 - number one most wanted uh library or
210:35 - like literally language right now like
210:37 - i was in like in terms of javascript
210:38 - like and yeah in comparison to like java
210:41 - and all of those things and python
210:42 - everything
210:43 - literally reacted sitting at the top on
210:45 - stack overflow
210:46 - yeah like because then like so net was
210:49 - huge before but remember like
210:51 - all programming is also it's constantly
210:53 - evolving it's constantly changing right
210:55 - now reacts on fire
210:56 - um javascript skills like literally
210:59 - you've got angular you've got react
211:00 - you've got view you've got all of these
211:01 - different
211:01 - things like i don't know who knows what
211:03 - it's going to be in two years but like
211:05 - all i know is that javascript is
211:06 - literally
211:07 - on it's fire right now it's on fire and
211:09 - it's definitely something which
211:12 - i think troy troy should be in this
211:13 - course dude like i don't know
211:15 - what are you waiting for honestly i
211:16 - don't know what are you what are you
211:17 - still doing i don't know what are you
211:18 - still waiting for honestly
211:20 - yeah it's really like and to be honest
211:21 - like dude like you get a 30 30 day money
211:23 - back guarantee so
211:25 - yeah give it a try risk free for that
211:28 - you're joined right now
211:30 - you me me sonny and you
211:33 - we all getting a call how about that how
211:35 - about that you join right now
211:36 - you're doing right now we'll get a slack
211:38 - call yeah link in the description bro
211:40 - and literally we'll jump on a call right
211:41 - now and we can have a chat
211:43 - that would be awesome yeah yeah nice
211:46 - choice like i try other red courses but
211:48 - you your teaching methods are really
211:50 - making a click yeah
211:52 - there we go sonny's killing it
211:56 - logan says i am a computer science grad
211:58 - and the projects inside the course are
211:59 - worth their weight in gold it's
212:00 - it's all the employers want to see
212:02 - that's amazing yeah there you go
212:04 - so so that was one that was by the way
212:06 - but that was by the way the goal
212:08 - of this this course this is when we when
212:09 - we first built this
212:11 - the goal was like what do the employers
212:13 - want to see like
212:14 - what type of projects do the employers
212:16 - want to see when they actually go to
212:17 - them right
212:18 - because as long as you just build some
212:19 - you know some some stuff that you don't
212:21 - even want to show
212:22 - like you're not proud to show but you
212:24 - want to build things that you're proud
212:26 - to show and you're like yo
212:27 - check my project out and they're gonna
212:30 - be like
212:31 - whoa that looks good exactly yeah
212:36 - 100 dude like is it everyone in the
212:38 - course like they have
212:39 - these like the sickest like the best
212:41 - sort of like portfolios they have
212:43 - everything sort of ready like
212:45 - if you go through the course and you
212:46 - literally do put in the work and you
212:48 - attend the coaching course
212:49 - literally like i think we have like four
212:51 - coaching calls every week now
212:52 - consistently
212:53 - yeah as well as we're dropping daily
212:54 - lives like we're doing so much on this
212:56 - on
212:57 - like i there's nothing like this at the
212:59 - moment in the programming community i
213:00 - don't think like
213:01 - i don't think so either and then the
213:03 - difference between us and
213:04 - any other course out there is that we
213:06 - don't just teach you how to code we
213:08 - teach you how to actually go ahead and
213:09 - make a killing with it like how to make
213:10 - some money
213:11 - from your coding like yeah whether
213:13 - you're a weekend so like i always sort
213:15 - of teach you in the coaching call like
213:16 - if you're a weekend you're at that point
213:18 - where you're you can teach somebody
213:20 - who's never coded
213:21 - a day in their life like you're a week
213:22 - ahead of them so you can start coaching
213:24 - you can start doing things there's
213:25 - always a way
213:27 - and we we go through all of that in the
213:28 - course
213:30 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh man
213:34 - nero says niro says do what you love and
213:36 - live what you do
213:37 - i love that that is that is a good motto
213:40 - yeah and she goes
213:41 - we get the work done and then we die
213:45 - of course we get to work on the first we
213:46 - do is we get the work done and then we
213:48 - just relax
213:48 - exactly yeah hassan goes it's past 3 30

Cleaned transcript:

talking about how to build a youtube thumbnail app in react.js now if you guys aren't sure what we mean here let me give you a quick rundown of what we're going to be doing today so on youtube you have all of these nice beautiful thumbnails that pop up every time you go over there right we needed an internal tool inside of um in inside the clever programmer team where we could basically go in and add our thumbnail to see what it looks like so that way we can see if you guys are click are going to click it or not and it helps us you know get the video out to more people so what we thought is right i had to build this as a side project right so i thought hang on hang on every single app that i've released out there and every single app that i put out there what i've ended up doing is i prepare it beforehand and then we pretty much go ahead and show you guys and demonstrate everything on a live stream right but today something something it's going to be very cool guys today i have not prepared anything so this is a entire sort of uh stream where pretty much you guys can code alongside me and we can go ahead and build this thing together so who is pumped let me know in the comments guys i can see a few people coming in this is awesome i see iosh i see i am one z pidgin what's up guys cena sure at z of z bridge and nice decide to come in now christian maher warden what's up guys good to see you all again if you guys are pumped and you guys are ready for this let's drop some fire in the comments and let's get everyone warmed up so we can um get started soon guys just to reassure you guys um for you who are new and who are joining in we are going to be building a react thumbnail app so essentially it's going to be a case of so what do we want to build today guys we basically want to have like a sort of lightweight react clone right but i would basically want to have it so that i can go ahead and add a thumbnail over here so right now we have garyvee's thumbnail i can go ahead and add a thumbnail so that way we can see how it looks inside of the app and we can basically test what different thumbnails look like before we actually put a video live so and guys if you guys find this super exciting and you guys find this useful we actually might go ahead and drop a full youtube clone so if that's something that you guys are interested in please let me know and we can go ahead and do that i see a few people in the comments right now so we have karen teodoro let's go ahead and let's get let's go and read some of your comments guys so we have teodoro saying it is a pleasure to see you it is a pleasure to see you guys and i love the support that you guys come and drop and honestly everything's blowing up guys and i can see some people uh returning i've seen uh familiar faces and it's always awesome to see you guys um so let's go ahead and carry on having a look so we have uh will you send us the download link right so this is a good question actually let me go ahead oh we got some comments firing in so will you send us the download link guys actually you know what let's let's do that as well you know once we build this app let's go ahead and deploy it and then that way you guys can go ahead and check it out and play with the app and stuff like that right that'll be fun i think that'll be pretty fun we can go ahead and see how it goes we have let's see our pete singh says he cannot wait awesome dude i like your enthusiasm guys if you're excited right now and you guys like these tutorials smash the thumbs up button because this helps it get out to more people and you know like we want we want as many people to see this stuff as we possibly can right now for you guys who have coded in react before let's go ahead and drop some fire in the comments because i love to see who's coding him react before and um panjie gautam says please build a youtube channel awesome okay milland says uh lovely sunny it's fun to make this type of project exactly dude that's exactly so let me go ahead and pin that one here yeah you know what i do like this kind of stuff guys this is like a side project right like we can code for like big stuff we can go for it for like you know production sort of level apps but sometimes we just need apps that help us out sometimes we just need to use react and have a bit of fun with react you know so we can basically build stuff that will basically make our life a little bit easier you know so today again guys what are we going to be doing we are going to be building a react thumbnail tester okay so this is essentially going to be we're not this is not an app to create a thumbnail this is basically going to be we're going to build a react app which looks pretty similar to this it's going to be responsive and the aim of this app is to test thumbnails out so so that way we can see what our thumbnail looks like here so whatever and also guys i also want to be able to test it so that whenever we pretty much go ahead and type in for example clever programmer here you see like these ones come up right here it would be cool right if we can go ahead and click this and actually upload our thumbnail right here enter the text and things like that so guys i have not built this and if you're wondering what this stuff is this is just a plugin that we use to sort of check out the stats on videos but guys i haven't built this yet so this is going to be a complete beginner build and this is going to be something where i have no idea how to build this so we're going to go ahead and build this together because i know a lot of you guys said that you noticed that a lot of it was sort of prepared beforehand you're right like we do a bit of preparation because obviously it's a lot of work that we end up going into these videos but i listened to you guys i answered you guys and we are gonna go ahead and build this thing for the first time i've never done this we're gonna go ahead and build this thing for the first time and we are gonna go ahead and get it working okay so let's go ahead and see how this goes guys i can see somebody said oh no oh god okay i think the wifi might be acting up um let's go ahead and see hopefully guys we have not got an issue with the stream here today because it's been quite an issue with the streams lately but hopefully it's all good so if you guys can see this stream clearly please let me know in the comments down below so nico nicosi nicosi says so this is like a youtube clone yeah it's pretty much gonna be like a simple version of a youtube clone um but we're gonna basically the purpose of this is so that you guys can go ahead and actually uh and it's really fast it's not me it's him yeah guys if it is lagging i apologize like i said we are working on that it's really tough to get internet speed where i'm at right now i am in london you'd be surprised it's annoying but yeah i mean we're gonna go ahead and make the best of what we have right here okay and let's go ahead and see how that goes okay so let's get started guys so before oh no we got more more lag let's go ahead he gets carbs so okay guys let me go ahead and check the stream out let me go ahead and see what's going on with this so we have well guys we actually have 150 people live right now this is insane okay so the stream looks good on my oh no okay it does lag a little bit guys but this whole video will be back online afterwards okay so what i'd recommend is guys maybe what i would recommend for all of you guys is to essentially go ahead and let the video buffer for about five minutes and then hit play and then that will actually allow you to sort of keep track and you won't have that sort of buffering annoying lag so that's my advice to you guys to get over this sort of annoying internet issue okay and like i said this whole video is going to be uploaded afterwards so don't stress out guys it's completely fine and we're gonna keep keep rolling with this we're gonna keep going okay so without further ado let's jump straight in okay so guys the first step that we want to do is actually go ahead and get this thing up and running so what we're going to do is i'm going to go and show you guys so we've in previous tutorials we've used a bunch of different things um but the number one tool that i love to talk about is create react app so let's go ahead guys and use create react app so let's go ahead and create react app so create react app is how we set up apps guys so in order to get this up and running all you need to do is run this command right here so mpx create react app okay so somebody says will the source code be available i can go ahead and make the source code available if you guys like okay so we can go ahead and do that um if you guys find this valuable okay so let's go ahead and check this out guys so i see a few people asking what is he going to work on guys so i'm just going to give one more round up of what we're actually going to be building today so remember it's a youtube thumbnail testing app guys so essentially it's a youtube sort of it's going to look like this we're going to have an app which looks like this and we're basically going to be able to click this but add our own thumbnail and test what the thumbnail looks like so it's an internal tool and i was going to build this by myself but i was actually thinking that instead of building it by myself i'll just go ahead and build it with you guys because that's fun right like we all like to sort of see like things for the first time and also i've noticed that all of the times i get a lot of questions as to like these things are really preparated uh prepared like and things like that but guys i want you guys to actually follow me along and we can build this whole thing together yo nas is in the house what's up nars we can see let's go ahead and tag in there what's going on bro so everyone who loves nars let's go ahead and drop him some fire in the comments and if you guys want to see nars back on a live stream let us know because i love doing sessions with nars his energy is insane we built a crazy cover 19 tracker that everyone seemed to love and we were happy to keep that stuff coming we just hit over 200 um viewers right now so that's amazing guys that is amazing right what's up guys nice let's go ahead and jump straight in guys so to get started what we are going to do is we are essentially going to go ahead and here i have the youtube covet code that we actually got running last time so actually what i want to go and do here is i want to open up a terminal so item let's go ahead and actually just but uh let's go ahead and pop this to the side let's go ahead and use this right now so you're gonna open up a clear terminal guys and let me just make this a bit bigger for you guys so you guys can go ahead and see that real clear so what you want to do here is run mpx right so you're gonna go into your correct folder so in this case i'm gonna go into my desktop um let's go ahead and somebody says can we make this with angular no guys we are learning react and we're gonna stick with react because i love react so we're gonna go ahead and do mpx create react app right create react app and then we basically need to give it a name so in this case i'm going to say youtube youtube thumbnail creator right youtube thumbnail creator awesome and then what this is going to do guys this is going to go ahead and set up the app i love nars dude like his energy is insane hey we got we got kazzy in the house let's go let's go guys drop some fire if you guys are excited and if you guys are like if you guys like these kind of videos where i'm going to go ahead and build things live with you guys then go ahead and smash the thumbs up button because it lets us know what kind of videos you like to do you know what kind of videos you guys like to see so i can see oh nice we've got uh we've got kazzy saying let's bring nars on this live stream if we can get nars on this live stream um then yeah like we can pretty much we can get ours on this live stream let's ask nars let's get in our zone on this because he said the resolution is wood and potato i know guys i know the resolution is horrible right now but let's just keep going and just make the best of it so guys what you're going to be doing is pretty much installing the react app like this but what we're going to do is we're actually going to plan out our app a little bit right so at this point guys remember like i said i haven't built this up before so this is going to be a first time for me so i'm going to have some kind of drag and drop functionality but we kind of need to build this out so i guess the let's just go ahead and draw on this and let's see what we can do so i need to open up screen brush because i've got a nice little tool here that i like to use and let's go ahead and do this so i'm going to put on freeze so i'm going to basically split this up into different components so the first thing i'm going to focus on building is this and nav bar right here right so we're going to build this nav bar very quickly and then i'm going to build out like this rough sort of sidebar so we have a rough idea of it and then i'm going to go ahead and build each of these little card components and we're basically just going to get a rough layout here guys so we can see a rough quick description and basically what i'm going to do is i'm just going to try and get to this point as fast as we can okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to start implementing some custom functionality so that we can actually go ahead and basically go here click it and then a little thumbnail or some kind of modal will pop up and then we can pretty much upload our own thumbnail or something along those lines okay so if you guys are excited for that smash the thumbs up and let me know and let's go guys let's go so right now um and also guys yeah like i said so remember i did mention that we actually want i can get on let's go nars wants to jump on as well let's go let me grab ours let me grab nars let me go ahead and one second oops what is going on here oops let me go ahead and unlock this let me go ahead and corners guys let's see if we can get another one oh i'm cool in nas guys we'll see if he can get on jump on all right once nasa replies we can actually get him on board and we can see that's insane guys if you guys love that see that's what it's all about uh clever programmer this spontaneous nature right so like even today was a spontaneous video and that's it like uh i can see loads of questions coming in let's go okay so what we oops not that one so let's go ahead and go back to what we were doing guys so nars will give us a call in a sec but guys what you want to do is once you get to this point right so once you get to this point um what you want to essentially do is let me just pull this up so you guys can see um let me minimize this one let's go ahead here so once you get to this point guys what you want to do is you essentially just want to go ahead and do cd into that youtube thumbnail creator okay so you're gonna go into that folder and then you basically i've set up a shortcut here so i just type in code dot and it will actually open up the code editor that you're that you're using so right now we use vs code over at clever programmer and if you want to install that sort of shortcut what you need to do is hold on bro we can't breathe so you probably reacted like i see those nice uh this is a that's a cool comment um so guys what you want to do is to get this actually up and running with that shortcut you're gonna help press command shift p command shift p and then you'll see this pop up right and you can go ahead and install i think it's if you type in yeah here you go install so you do install code command in uh code inside is command and pass so you guys can see that right and then basically yours will say install code command impart and that will actually go ahead and work for you and it works the way you need it to work so um that will actually go ahead and give you that sort of code dot functionality so i'm going to go ahead and make this huge for you guys so you guys can see this real nice so what we want to do is once you have your app up here guys what you want to do is go ahead and do mpm start and that will spin up your react app okay so once you have your react app running then you can pretty much go ahead okay so nars is ready guys so once it we're gonna get the app up and running so we just actually spun it up right now so we have this up and running right here so um this isn't showing the full app but let's go ahead and bring nars on guys let's bring those on let's let's get this thing a little bit let's get this thing excited let's go ahead and let me call nars one second guys let's see if he picks that up over it clever man if you want hello yo what's up nuts what's up man how are you doing this is dope man hold on hold on hold on let me put on the camera here hold on a second one second bro hey let me bring you on one second let me how do i okay there we go all right guys are you ready are you ready to bring nas on let's go three are we live are we all okay there we go we're live we are live what's up everybody hope you guys are doing amazing how's it going hope all is great welcome i don't know amazing dude let me go ahead and i'll share my ecam live with you there you go and then you can see nice dude yo that's so insane man well nice have you heard what we're building on monday what are we building what are we building we're burning a tinder clone on monday oh a tinder clown yeah oh man a lot of people will be able to use that let's go they'll be jokes right we've got tick tock we've got a few things coming up this week spotify cologne i think as well right mmhmm we've got a spot of fireclone we've got tiktok and we've got uh a youtube full clone so today we're going ahead and building so we we needed an internal uh an internal tool to basically go ahead and see you know like the thumbnails what they look like and stuff right so pretty much like these thumbnails over here instead of actually going ahead and what we used to do is we used to actually go and inspect it guys and we would basically go ahead and swap the picture but it's kind of annoying to do that every time and then right our own little thumbnail in there so instead we thought let's just build an app where it basically does that for us okay it's kind of overkill but it's kind of fun you know hey you know what sometimes you gotta do overkill man exactly so let's go ahead i just got the app started up so here you go we've got the app up and running here i don't know why it's not showing the entire oh there we go let me go ahead and make that there we go can you still see me by the way you can see you can still see me right oh yeah yeah i still got you in the corner let me go ahead and actually fix that one second because i've got that locked right now so let me go ahead and bring both of us on um how do i do that so i go to oh god this is where this is like it's messy okay that's it and then this is very like live where you're basically where you are live and and you're trying to basically it's like you're producing your show alive man seriously this is all right right honestly i've got you up wait okay okay we've swapped positions but let me go ahead then hey there we go there you go literally guys this is so funny literally i was really literally eating i know hold on let i was literally eating like you're so sunny sunny like okay okay let's go now i had no shirt on i was just eating outside and then so then guys like yeah let's bring nozzle holy hold on hold on give me a second give me a second let me put let me at least put a shirt on you know you see because he's come and hit us wait really let's give bro i'm down to come daily i'm so down to come to l.a in september oh guys who's ready to have the whole cp team live in person like in person oh the energy is just going to be epic drop some fire in the comments because that's so crazy right literally we'll have like the whole team in the cp mansion oh man too good oh sorry i made my day man that's so fun right me and kazi were talking before and we are so pumped uh okay so send me an ecam when you start sharing your screen add nars and sunny both in there okay so i've done that for all right okay so i've done it here but i need to do it here as well let me quickly let me go ahead and fix that um see guys this is called live debugging right here there you go wait hey oh there's there's me there's there you go there's nice okay there's two people down there hey there we go and then lock that there we go get out of pip mode we're not in pit mode are we i think we're good yeah what is pimp mode i think oh i think it was a little bit delayed you know with the live stream oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i think we're good to go now let's do it let's keep going let's do it right yeah okay so guys when you get your app up and running you'll basically start it off and then you'll you'll get this screen all right so once you're at this screen it's a good starting point so now what you want to go ahead and do and that we call this like the cleanup process right so you want to go ahead and delete this file so go ahead and get rid of this one go ahead and get rid of the test files because we don't need those and the logo the svg which is that little spinning react icon that you guys saw and then it's going to start freaking out because it's like oh my god that you you got rid of files that shouldn't be gotten rid of so i'm going to go ahead and hide the terminal for now but we basically just need to clean this up we go ahead delete that and then here i just get rid of this entire block right so this entire block and then let's just go ahead and say like uh let's just call it youtube let's just say hello clever programmers nice all right so hello programs and then we save it and then guys you'll get this you'll get to this screen right so once you're on this screen what i see so you can see the text is still centered right so we still have some css in play so what you want to go ahead and do is go to app.css go ahead and just get rid of everything there and then once you save that you'll see it actually snapped over so if i go ahead and undo that and click save you see that like that's with this sort of css is automatically there but once we go ahead and delete that and i save it you can see it automatically gets rid of a lot of the code that was um the sort of that's when you when you remove css when you add css when i remove their css oh okay okay yeah because they kind of add some css we don't we don't want any rules so we just have a blank canvas to work from gotcha yeah and then what i like to do is add one more rule so guys can you see like over here right we get this like kind of empty space like up here so you see this like we get this empty margin and it's always annoying right like we don't want this empty margin here so what we need to do to get rid of that is guys how do you think how do you think we could get rid of that drop down in the comments yeah let us know literally yeah exactly that's a really good point so we can go ahead and let uh let us know in the comments we also have guys just in case you're wondering we do have a bunch of styling in here right uh and you can see they actually do apply the sort of magic rule up here but that doesn't always work i like to actually we can add it in this level but you see like they've done it here margin zero but the actual thing is and we'll see if it comes through i think it's a little bit delayed on the comments um but what i would say here guys is the magic rule that we're looking for is basically we want to say to everything go ahead and give everything a margin of zero and look this is what the app looks like before right and as soon as i hit save so i'm about to hit save on this right now so as soon as i hit save boom watch what happens yeah you see that there we go nice yeah so it kind of snapped to the top left corner and that is basically like going to be that's like quite important step because yeah there we go everyone got it right nice and look at that elon eon stories because that margin zero looks like gold margin zero dang a lot you guys are killing it yeah look we got everyone here we got margin padding oh someone said padding as well okay interesting interesting yeah two padding as as well yeah so the the point is that that way at least you've got a blank canvas that you can kind of work from right um so now what we're going to do is so now this is actually the first time we've gone into a build we're pretty much nothing's prepared oh seriously yes so nothing's bad right yeah this is entirely like we just have to build this out like all right let's do it actually hold on bro bro since they brought someone like this can you do can you do vs code share can you yeah let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it guys so vs code this setup live show right now so uh start collaboration session there we go yeah just send me slack as well and send me slack yeah there you go guys by the way by the way guys who was able to finish the color tracker i know a lot of you guys probably have saw us on this who's able to finish the cover track let us know in the comments below that was an epic video yeah like everyone seemed to love that video dude yeah that one took off like crazy yeah yeah and uh that was actually pretty cool that was showing you guys how to use an api with react and uh and it looks beautiful at the end guys so definitely worth going and checking that one out if you're interested um let's go and see so now this will be more you can share your logos as well oh yeah okay so guys yeah when you're sharing right you see nars just joined in right so you can see over here it says no it's just joined your collaboration session so that's the first thing you want to do and then that basically you guys can see that nars is in here right now which is so dope that means we can code together right now you see when we have an app running at localhost 3000 so this is the app running at low cost 3000. basically what you guys want to go ahead and do is share that port so now if i go if i go and show you so um i think i am sharing 3000. oh you are okay yes if you click on this one right here it looks like you yeah if you click on that right there then it means basically nars can access my local which is insane that means we can code together we can do everything sort of together um nice okay there you go and guys it's like google docs this is epic man holy yeah it's crazy right yeah so now guys what we're going to do now is because we pretty much are like in a very experimental phase this one's kind of more to show them like pretty much like you know how we go from like building the app out and like how we go from styling it all and we can kind of ask questions while we answer questions while we do it but it's sort of like showing them that like if we were like it's natural to run into those debugging problems and it's to sort of face those issues that you face like um so yeah the first thing that we were going to do guys is go ahead and actually sort of break this down so i showed everyone earlier that like you were basically going to go ahead and like this is a component the header component we're going to go ahead and roughly build this out and then go ahead and sort of build like this little sidebar and we're going to get it roughly sort of looking like not not exactly at this point we just kind of want to outline it first right and even these little cards you see like just get them to a point where we can pretty much get them in place and then we'll sort of style it and get it tweaked right right and so and and so the goal is pretty much the goal is pretty much to create like a a almost like a youtube clone right like youtube clone but a way to test thumbnails is that what you're saying exactly exactly that yeah so it's a youtube clone to test out thumbnails so in this case and we're also going to have support for this screen so you see on this screen so when you click on the search bar we're going to basically have it so it goes to forward slash search just as a sort of test and then this will render like this kind of view and we'll basically show what it looks like on this screen which would be nice it would be kind of cool right obviously guys all of this stuff is like extra we don't this is all the sort of extra plugin this isn't here on the actual youtube so you won't see your stuff okay so so let's get started so what should we so should we should we like write down some of the steps i could think of like a todo like steps in terms of like so we have them kind of have them kind of like in a process base what do you think yeah let's do it so that means some kind of notes right or we could do that one i think we can do it on code right you can do it yeah yeah like what i like to like i like to create like a readme file like md file like a readme file nice name it like a to do dot md or whatever whatever it is you want to name it and then yeah beautiful there we go and you can hit that little thing right here and it shows you a really nice little preview you see that yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh yeah that's cool that's really cool so let's do this all right so steps yeah let's go ahead and do steps so the steps that we're going to basically have guys to get going oh nice smart hey look at that so you can see there we go i don't know how do you do like one oh there you go nice yeah yeah the first step guys is let's go ahead and maybe like let's go and build the header maybe yeah so the header component um step two should we maybe do the sidebar yeah it's just a sidebar that's the sidebar and then uh yeah the solid and then i would see and then the main the main component yes main body component i would say right yeah so build body and card component right yeah yeah yeah and then there we go yeah and then we're basically we can go ahead and say so i think once we get this page going maybe it'll be a good idea to sort of figure out you know like that sort of how we're gonna solve that problem of where we click on a thumbnail so when we go ahead and we click on like a thumbnail over here and like so i was thinking maybe like some kind of popup which opens like a drag and drop sort of thing so you drag and drop a file and it saves it to state and it basically you know like it will render it here so when we will you have any default will we have any default images in there that's that's question one right will there be any default images yeah so good question so i think maybe like what we could do it actually is maybe have like this one and this one to be like placeholders and everything else would have like a default image yeah yeah okay let's yeah let's do that let's have like a like if you see that image right that could be basically like um you can almost have i mean i'm not sure like what's easier if a drag and drop is easier or what is easier um but we could probably have to have that box just be a drag and drop and then you know and that's it pretty much right yeah i mean something like that right like or some kind of like upload a file button or something yeah you're like you're like like you get that little like a little upload file button on there yeah yeah oh like when you hover over right like when you hover over it yeah like we could do that like a hover over thing or like even like because we basically want to be able to even customize this stuff you know there's some kind of a modal maybe like that pops up when we click on the thumbnail that could be cool yeah so yeah i'll actually i like the idea i actually that's probably a better and easier idea so when you click because a model is easy to bring up right yeah you can always very easy so you basically click on the thumbnail when you click on the thumbnail it brings up a model you choose an image you choose the title you know you choose anything you want to change and that's it and it saves it yeah let's go yeah exactly let's do that and then we can put the title the description the sort of and stuff like that right yeah yeah there we go let's go ahead and do that so yeah if you guys find this exciting because this is like literally me and nars are building this we've never done this right so it's like we're live as well doing this for you guys as well this is going to be really interesting i will say yeah so we're going to run into issues hopefully it will go smooth nice okay awesome um let's go oh i i don't i don't think it will go smooth i'll be honest with you that's for sure but but we're gonna finish it that's the most important we are gonna finish it exactly so we're gonna build the helicopter build the sidebar component build the body and card and then let's go ahead and maybe get that modal build modal component right um and uh and i guess like something like unsolve the thumbnail some of the thumbnails stuff so we'll go ahead and we'll just attack with this when we get let's just let's just make this let's just make point five or just like imagine like one but just build some stuff you know yeah like point by just build some stuff that's point five you know exactly like build build guys drop in the comments below if you just want to build if you just want to build just drop that in the comment below you know okay nice all right i think we should jump in so step one building the header component so this is the step that we are on right now oh god what happened okay we are on this step right here so building the header component so the youtube header what i tend to do is whenever i do a clone or something right i just go ahead over to the app and i'll basically go ahead and inspect it and i kind of just like grab everything from it so i kind of grab the sort of rough dimensions that we've got a youtube logo over here um and then you sort of like just sort of piece it together like that i guess like even this right here because we're not going to be implementing the full sort of functionality this is just to get a rough sort of look and feel of the youtube app right right right right right like a youtube sort of logo on the top left the search box which would be cool and then sort of like this stuff is all extra but even like these three icons or four icons on the right so good demonstration of flexbox here right so are we gonna use any grid are we just using flexbox or are you gonna use any like row column grid or no or just material ui right um so actually good point let's use material ui yeah let's use material ui so guys if you guys don't know what material ui is is we've used it in a bunch of projects before oh oops material ui it's material yeah there we go it's a popular react ui framework by google and it basically gives you all of the google looking stuff like you're basically going to get yeah it's a lot like google like stuff like apps so you need to run this command which is an npm install material ui core so you need to go ahead and open up your code and basically do this command so it's going to be i like to go ahead and open up a second terminal so you have the left one running the app the right one running um the other stuff so let's go ahead and make this one much smaller there we go and we do npm install material ui core and nice did you know you don't actually have to do save what do you oh when you do npm install yeah why really yeah i don't know because he told me this and then i read up on it apparently nowadays like with the new version by default it saves to the package dependencies oh dang kazi you fancy man you fancy that's cool right yeah you don't have to do that anymore like saves that headache okay i didn't know that honestly dang all right cool yeah so guys that successfully installed so you can see there like everything's sort of done it says added your packages and that is all done so now we can go ahead and drop that down um but like what we're gonna do first guys is go ahead and sort of introduce a component here so some kind of header right so like this right obviously this doesn't exist right now so i would go ahead and do is go ahead and create a file called header oops header dot like this and then guys really really cool extension that we talk about a lot is something called it's called um react oh no is it snippets which snippets um es7 there you go es7 snippets so this one right here so this top one right here guys go ahead and install this like this is such a good uh uh such a good extension and what you do is he does it gives you like these snippets so for example where we have a header right here what we can do is we can do rfce and basically boom it gives you the whole react sort of code for that and it even inputs the file name which is dope yeah yeah that saves you a bunch of headache so so actually i'm actually because guys who knows who knows what like this is right here like this function header like if you know i'm really curious because i always say this is you know what you're learning kind of react at the same time yeah like who knows like what is this like what is this like what kind of a component is this you know if you do know drop that in the comments below and we'll see if you guys are right but yeah let's continue on exactly and like guys i always see comments about like uh class space first functional and those sort of style things right like what we're doing here is we're basically writing something called a functional component so this is a functional component right and basically the purpose of this is it's just like it's just a function it's literally a javascript function which returns some jsx and jsx is basically javascript where you can basically have some javascript code inside of it so you can say like abc and obviously this isn't going to do much but like you can actually go ahead and like you could do something like this return abc or like something similar like that but you could basically do a bunch of stuff in here and or run javascript code inside and it will just return a block of html and the purpose of this guys is because what you want to do then is go back into your app and just pull in that header right and you can reuse stuff like that so in this case what we're going to go ahead and do is i like to basically press so if you actually go to the end of the line and you press ctrl spacebar it pops up like this and it says autoimport from header so you can do that it pops it in click save go to nice click save and then you actually go ahead and say like i am a header right right and what we can do now is what i like to do is i split these two files so you drag that over then you've got your your function or your app over here and then you've got your header component over here and this gives you like a very nice overview of the two things right so what we can go ahead and do is we can go ahead and check our app so you can see over here now you've got like i'm a header so at the very top it shows you i am a header so i'm going to go and zoom in here you can see i am header there we go okay so that's nice so now what we're going to do is we need to actually go ahead and make it look like this header right so there's a bunch of things that we need to do to get it to this point so the first one does material i have have a header like that that may be at this point uh we can check we can definitely check so let's go ahead and check um materials like a nav like material ui nav or something let's go ahead and have a look so you've got let's search so nav i think they've got they've got like a bottom navigation so bottom navigation like this kind of thing you see but then we need like a top navigation so they have i don't think they do i think but what we could do here is to be honest it's literally just a case of it's a white background so it's okay and then we can use flexbox to get this styling and basically what we can do is we can say that the search so this field right here takes up most of the most of the space so you see like it takes up pretty much all of the middle and then this gets pushed to the left and this stuff gets pushed to the right so um those of you who are comfortable with flexbox or you've used flexbox before definitely let us know in the comments because we love flexbox and we we use it all the time on the channel um yeah that'd be i think we should definitely drop a maybe a like a flexbox foggy kind of video you know that would be cool that'd be cool if you guys want to see a flashback from a flexbox tutorial with a fun game let us know in the comments in the comments below and we'll do a live call like that as well exactly guys yeah just let us know no we don't right so jumping back in guys we have the header and then we have this right here so what i might actually get go ahead and do is actually to make it very quick to show them the app let me go ahead and pull the app in here as well and then that way we can go ahead and do this we can show like this is what the app looks like oh yes oops that's actually not using up the full space i hate it when chrome goes you know full screen by default yeah oh i know yeah yeah yeah it's so annoying like what you need to do is just do this do this boom and there we go that's well nice nice there we go so guys we have the app here so we have with the the header and the snare and the the goal is to get to this point right so the first thing that we can notice is that um oops and this is now too low i need to get this there we go yep so the first thing is a white background guys we want to get a white background here so let's go ahead and get that done so in the the code basically imagine this is our container so this is gonna be the thing surrounding it so i like to just draft it out so we have like the youtube logo on the left we have the search box in the middle and then we have the sort of the remainder so let's just call them the right side logos right so the right side logos and basically you can see here we have pretty much like a rough sort of scale or outline of what we're going to do now so under on the top left we'll have the youtube logo middle we'll have a search box and then right side logos and then what i like to use is something called bem so here everything should follow like a convention where it's the component and then it's like the element that you're talking about so in this case that the parent component usually has the component's name as your class name for your outside container so we have header here and then what we need to do is make a header.css file to include some css here so let's go ahead and do that and to use this so i'll make this a bit easier for you guys to see so to use this now we need to import it so let's go ahead and import let's do header dot css there we go and now oh so you input the css into individual files right not not like into a batch index file right exactly and then that means that your styling is basically component specific so gotcha gotcha what i like to do sometimes is pull over the the css file on the left and the code on the right and then this is a really nice way of seeing like your your stuff like left you know like left to right yeah yeah so here what we can do is just to get a rough sort of demonstration we can do like h1 logo h2 like h1 search box and then here h1 um let's just say write logos okay so what i like to do is just sort of get a rough thing so right now you can see that there's these three things and they're just stacked on top of each other right yeah which is obviously like not what we want so guys what we can do here is we can actually apply flexbox so imagine what we've actually done right now is this is the header that we've just created to this right here but by default what happens is the display type is something called block and block just naturally puts one element it gives one element full width and it basically takes up an entire row and then it basically just stacks them like this right yeah so how do we fix that guys like how if you know that how do we fix that that issue i'm sure you guys know that drop down in the comments below if you do we'll give you some extra points exactly are you coming through right now one second is this is coming through right yeah yeah yeah should be able to yeah yeah because it says yeah it's coming through yeah i hope so you guys hear me like if you guys hear me let us know let me know in the comments let us know in the comments like can you hear me like yo yo yo what's up what's up what's up you know yeah are you not have you got the comments open right now yeah i do yeah nice okay dope um let's go so right now what we are going to do is actually yeah so guys what we need to do now is we need to change this display type so it goes and uses the flexbox rules right um so now what we're going to go ahead and do is we have the header right so we're going to do is we're going to target the header and we're going to say display so by default it gives it this it gives it display block right which is where it stacks them on top of each other it's actually the children element so this is our parent this one right here and then these are all children inside of it right so now we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and basically do display flex now before i click save guys i'm gonna click save on this but watch what happens here right so as soon as i click save look at the difference it makes so i'm going to go ahead and actually open this on two screens so we can do a cool little demo whenever i do stuff like that so let me go ahead and do this so yeah so as soon as i hit save guys look what happens so watch it so as soon as i hit save it goes display flex but it goes into a row do you see that so everything kind of stacked on top like next to each other beautiful beautiful just so easy just display flex guys seriously um display flex by default is going to actually just go ahead and put everything in a row and it will only use up the space it needs to use so now what we can go ahead and do is actually go and basically do this the following so we can say right now they're all next to each other and it hasn't got any rules so we can say justify content space between and what this will do is as soon as i save this so that before i hit save so right now this is without and if i click save what i can do is yeah you see that there we go nice nice so if i undo that um there we go it has this and if i redo it space between goes ahead and does that i mean and we can even do like the space evenly which will make it like even like put some patty on the right hand side as well so if you do like for example if you try like space evenly for example yeah so as soon as i hit save check that out nice might not be the best yeah yeah yeah let's put it back to space between but that's a cool use case yeah so like in some situations you might want space evenly but in our case we want space between so it will push it like everything to its appropriate space right yeah and that's nice okay so that's pretty much we're getting there um so the next part is what i like to do now is actually sort of put containers around these different areas because right now we have these single elements which are basically is not very useful for us right like the logo yeah sure could be the first child but i like to go ahead and do the following i use emmet which is like the shortcut for writing class names so i do div dot and then here we can say header let's just say logo and you see that it pops in and actually gives us a container with a little stuff you're too fancy sonny i know dude [Laughter] british shortcut you know so what we could do there is we can go ahead and do the same for the search box so div dot uh header search and we can go ahead and copy that in there and we can do the same for this one so we can say div header and while he's doing this guys just like keep in mind like you know the way we build this stuff and you know sunny i anybody else um you know you can see how we like to just right away you know put down the html put down the structure and then with the css we basically we figure that out later right sunny right now he put down the logo the search box the right logo is right he put the html structure down right away then right away and then after that we go we go ahead and we play with css to see how we want we want to make it look like so let's just keep that in mind it's always a really good process to go through as you're building you know anything pretty much you know anything else exactly um i just wondering so you went live on the wrong one oh snap i actually didn't change the i didn't change the restroom oh damn it okay it's i i think i over it a live stream wait what yeah oh man well i think i i done i didn't change the event oh damn it i changed everything no it will create it will create a new one all right will it i think yeah it will just create a new one because that event is already has already expired okay okay nice all right yeah yeah so christ is divided right nice but now guys we can see like we've got it sort of near enough like we just need this sort of input and like a logo here so we're going to quickly tackle that um so let's go ahead and do that so here we have so we have a search bar so instead we just want to input and we need a a button so like this so it's just the button would have an icon inside of it so just type in icon for now and here we should have something like this so um wait a minute this isn't right where's the input oh oh my oh that's very large this is because yeah wait this is strange where's the input though still uh let me show you on the screen because this is actually the correct screen so there we go okay so it's very tight there we go okay okay okay super small over here guys um but what we want to do is basically you see that input is tiny so right now that's really hard to see i don't know why it doesn't come up on this screen for some reason um really yeah that's being strange oh yeah there we go yeah nice yeah so guys you see like this right here so it's very hard to see but like this right here is the search bar okay and right now we want this to take up the majority of the space here right right the way we fix that is we say we need to say that this child should use um so flex yeah i should use flex one exactly yeah which which guys which what that does is that gives a basically like a weight i think if you think of a trade like a hierarchy right i think it like hierarchy what's more important it's going to give that input box a much higher importance value and a hierarchy value which will allow it to kind of grow and uh you know take up as much space as i can exactly yeah yeah uh yeah exactly so think of it as weights guys yeah so initially everything has like an equal weight but now if we say that the header search should have like more weight so let's say it's got flex one what this will do is like before i hit save on this notice how right now it's very difficult to see this but you see like um let me go ahead and point to it so you see like this right here like as soon as i hit save look what happens so i hit save and then i think we oh no oops i need to hit save properly one sec let's hit save and then you see like what actually happened was it did move over right because yes what has actually happened is right now there's like an invisible sort of like it's saying take up all of this space right now but it's just left the line because there's two children which is the input and this button right right right right right okay yeah yeah okay so we got the input we got the logos sure okay so we got that should we put in like a logo like a youtube logo to see how that's gonna start to look like yeah cause right now this looks horrible yeah images down yet yeah this is horrible right so guys what we can use is we can go ahead and use something called material ui icons right which is really cool so material ui icons um if we go here to icons and what we can do is to install it this is actually a really handy thing right so you can see they've got this search full list of icons if we go ahead and click that it will pull up the material ui icons like a little search panel what we can do is in the youtube search you see they've got this little uh nice sort of search hourglass right so if we go into material ui and we type in search there you go there we have it right there damn okay i like that okay let's do it if we click that it actually goes ahead and give us even gives us the code that we need which is dope i like that yeah so in order to get that usable what we need to do is we need to do npm install material ui icons like right here and then we go back to our code pull up the terminal and then we just need to run the following so i'm just trying to see because i don't think they can actually see the there we go so if i bring that tightly higher yeah there you go so now if i go ahead and do an installment to your ui icons that will actually go ahead and pull in the icons that we need um so that will actually go ahead and do what we want so you can see right now it's actually installing everything down here right there's not an [Laughter] right so i think at this point um while that's doing that uh let's go ahead and just carry on with the build so right now the header let's leave it there for a sec leave it there for a sec because this is more of a one second let's go ahead all right so we've got the header right and then we were saying the next step was to do oops the youtube logo is that we said youtube logo wait or are we finished like complete the header finishing up the complete header or what no no we can carry on yeah we can carry around yeah i was gonna roughly sort of draft it out you know like kind of have the sidebar in place and then okay let's do i actually i like that way better i like to basically just have a structure down and then we can put all the other all the other things down so yeah let's do that so we have the header and then we said next on the list was the to do so let's go ahead and check out it was the sidebar right so in order to get the sidebar up and going so what we now need to do is do this so let's go ahead and do so sidebar so this would be a sidebar component and now what we need to do in order to get a sidebar up is we go ahead create a new file and we call it sidebar.js nice rfce goes ahead and pulls everything in right so that's that little shortcut that we said and just to get just to prove that everything's nice um we need to go ahead and type in i um a sidebar like this like that right and then what we need to do is do if you remember click on the end of this do control spacebar and it says all i'll import from sidebar and you can actually sort of little trick there to sort everything going and now what you can see is you see like this is where we had everything before so you had the top part and then it just rendered in the sidebar right yeah yeah oops let's go ahead and yeah so rendered in the sidebar here nice so now what we want to do is i think sunny with the sidebar so if you have the sidebar so if you're looking at this right here you see you see what i'm doing here yeah right so if we have for example because since we're doing since we're doing the structure if we have a sidebar and let's say and i just kind of put this down uh and then we have the main right what do we want the main thing that's going to have the the actual youtube logos or youtube um thumbnails what should we call that um so you're talking about this part right let's go over back to the main part so all of this right yeah yeah like that yeah exactly what shall we call that for example let's call this um let's just call it the sort of should we call it videos container or something like that or video um um yeah i mean we can yeah we can call it like we can call like a video container sidebar or we can call like main container as well let's just call it main container for now so when we refer to the main container guys we're talking about this right here so this entire sort of container right yeah yeah yeah but yeah yeah exactly but the reason why like i was i kind of break this down so if you go back to the code for example right if you go back um so with this right i feel like i think what's going to happen is because we have the sidebar on the left and the main container on the right you almost have to wrap these in the div right almost kind of like in a div right because then well let me remove that because that is what will allow us to have like a sidebar yeah right and a main container be next to each other right yeah correct okay okay exactly yeah so it's a really good point that now i said guys when you want to have this remember by default this is going to have um this is going to have display type block which means it's going to basically put things on top of each other but what we actually need is we need it to look like we need the logo on the sort of side the the header at the top but then we need the sidebar on the left and then the main container on the right right right just how they have it in youtube so right now like you can see the header is always at the top and then you have this sidebar on the left and then you have everything on the right so if nars is right um yeah so we need to wrap that so it's really good point there um okay so what we can do is we can go ahead and apply some bem here so we can say app oops class name and we can say class name equals app underscore the scopes and here let's just call this one um naming is always the hardest thing in development yeah and this is what i mean like this is where they see the actual live you know yeah so we've got app and then we've got app but let's just call it let's just say the um page so the rest of the page right this will be the header and this will be the rest of the page like you can you can say like home page because we'll have like a different page later on right which is going to have like um right you could save the whole page like for example yeah yeah yeah oh yeah but uh we'll introduce react router to get that done oh okay okay okay i gotcha gotcha okay nice and we'll see how we'll see how the build goes up to the first page point and if it's enough like for like you know like we'll see how we go on with that yeah yeah yeah sure that so now we've got the app page here and basically to so like what nas mentioned earlier so it says main container is not defined oh yeah this one here so for now i'm just going to go ahead and point out so like right now you can see like um actually let's go ahead and build that container because we're actually going to need that right yeah yep so let's go ahead and add that so go here close this file oops you can save that we need to go ahead and let me make this visible need to go ahead and create a file and call it the main container yes and we do a little trick rfce boom and then here guys remember like just say like h1 here is where the videos goes here's where videos go nice something like that right yeah and inside of the apps let's go open up our app so now you can see like we have the main container remember we need to pull that in otherwise it's going to freak out so if you open up your uh terminals let me go ahead and close this one so you can see like even your terminal is going to give you all of this stuff so like if you're if you're not always like say you've got a small screen and you don't want to keep doing back and forth you can actually use your terminals you're sort of like place of uh sort of knowing where an error is and things like that so we do this and sometimes it doesn't work that trick you need to do something like import main container from main container and then that works and now let's see there we go so i'm a sidebar here's where the side videos go so let's make it easier so let's go ahead and get rid of the that so it's not as confusing and now you can see guys we've got the header at the top right and then we have i am a sidebar and we have this is where uh let me bring that in a bit yeah here is where the videos go right so now is what what's the next step right now so like right now these are block how do we get yeah to look the way we need it so so guys so if we have down you can see that i'm a sidebar and then here's where the videos go right they are kind of on top of each other so what we want to do is we want to bring into to the left and to the right hand of each other so we want them to be basically next to each other just like how we have it on the youtube page right sidebar on the left you know the main pages on the right so what we the next step is to convert that from where being on top of each other to be into the left and to the right hand side of each other and what we can use for that as i'm sure you guys you all know what can we use for that drop that in the comments below but we can use for that something called display flex and if we try that out that should be the thing to fix it awesome exactly that so flex is your best friend guys like here what we can do is we can go ahead and target it and we can say that container should have display flex ben deloila ben de loyola says flex again yep we're going to see a lot of flex so display flex and as soon as what i'm going to do here is i'm going to do that little neat trick so we can see it in action before i save it so just as i save it now what we should see is it goes from a display block so this and this it should snap to the side of each other right so as soon as i hit save there you go nice nice nice nice nice nice awesome and what we can do here is what i like to do here is actually like whenever you have like a sidebar or something like that let's just go back to the code so whenever you have like a sidebar or something so like firstly let's create the corresponding sort of css files because we want our sidebar to have some styling so let's go ahead and do sidebar.css and let's go ahead and do maincontainer.css and remember you need to import these into the components guys so i see a lot of people actually make that mistake when they're learning that why is my css not being applied it's because you're most likely not pulling it in at this point i made this mistake a bunch when i was learning so i wouldn't actually i'd forget to write this and um yeah and then you you're writing all sorts of css rules in here and then you're freaking out as to why they're not being used uh that's most likely the reason nice can you believe it my command key is actually chipping away now but i mean chipping away like you can't use it anymore no no then the actual text on my command key is actually slowly chipping away oh man it's aggressive coding right why you so being being so aggressive with it huh i know right it's like slowly dripping away so sad come on come on come on need to get there man do it right so we have the sidebar there you go we have the sidebar and now what we can do is and if you guys are wondering how i keep pulling up this shortcut right here it's just command p and you can actually go ahead and type in stuff and then you bring up your file really nice way of like speeding up your workflow yeah it's nice we have the sort of main container and we have the sidebar and this is where you want to get to like a high level overview of everything yeah um so now what i like to do usually is actually sort of draw like an imaginary border around everything so you can kind of see like from the getgo what it all looks like right so the sidebar what we got what we can go ahead and do is we can go ahead and say um so this div we need to say class name is sidebar and we also want the main container to have its own class name of main container like that and then what we can say is main container can have a border of one pixel solid black right and what i'm going to do is i'm going to click save and you should see it pop in here so now you see that it just popped in there it's black border right okay okay so we're going to do is we're going to go to sidebar.css and do the same thing we'll say sidebar i'm going to say one pixel oops border one pixel solid black and then as soon as i hit save we'll see that there we go nice nice it's always a nice way to do that because then what you can actually go ahead and do now is actually do what nars talked about earlier which is that sort of weighing you know that where you have determined the weights of things right yeah so like if we look at the actual youtube app we can notice that like the sort of split here is like what would you say the split is here like between the sidebar as opposed to the rest of the app so like i would say it's like 20 yeah it's like 20 right and then all of that stuff kind of gets like about 80 right yeah we want this side to have like 80 and this side to have 20 so the sidebar should have 20 percent and the uh and and the main content should have 80 percent right but in order to get to that point what we want to do is go ahead and do what we talked about earlier which is in the weighings so would that be hinos so to weigh it yeah yeah uh well actually what guys would it be here would we would we set the weight inside the class name app page or where we do that yeah five seconds five four three two one [Laughter] well yeah this will be and on the sidebar and the main container so if we go ahead if we actually go to the sidebar um and we will go to the sidebar css right um yeah the sidebar one right right is this oh yeah yeah of course you're right yeah it'll be on the side but it'll be in the child guys exactly exactly so if you go to the sidebar css then what we need to do is we just set the flex for the side sidebar we need to set the flex for that to be what yep so here remember we previously gave the search bar one because we said take up as much room as you want yeah but in this case and guys just so you know the value here is between zero and one so like you choose a value between zero and one so uh in this case we said 20 right which is 0.2 0.2 okay beautiful and as soon as we hit save on that we should see i'm not sure if we'll see actually much difference here but we can actually go ahead and try so if i do 0.2 now you can here okay yeah so you used up 20. so nice right yeah and then and then the other one which is the where the videos go the other one which is the main container right that one is going to be zero point guys what zero point eight i mean you you should know that oh wait actually i just told you the answer never mind i'm like wait hold on i just tell you the answer 0.8 exactly so before i hit save so let's go and have a look and as soon as i hit save boom nice nice beautiful and what we can actually do guys is what can we do now what do you think because what can we do so because we can kind of have it right now where it's like in a very like you know roll cut type level how can we make the sidebar and then where the videos go actually be a full screen almost like what can we do about that what do you think sunny so i think we can use um we can set the height of it right we can set that okay to be using i actually always run into this issue i mean i always do this so i would say like something like height um and then i'll do i think it's like a hundred is it view height or is it a hundred percent you can do vh you can do vh but that's gonna basically that's gonna actually create because it's below the navigation bar that that is going to create basically like um a scrollable so actually do vh right now do vh and you'll see what i mean do vh as soon as i hit save watch what happens guys so there you go but you see it scrolls down because that we're not accounting for this topic so we're saying 100 of the view height but then the view height is actually there you see that so it goes over right yeah so the only way the only way for us to fix that the only way for us to fix that so check this out can i can i take i'm gonna take over here so some uh coding here for a second okay go for it um so if we go ahead and if we go to app.js right which are you on the gs yeah let me yeah so app suggests yeah so follow follow me here for a second okay if you can yep i'm following you now beautiful so for an app.js right in order for us to basically have a where you know where the whole thing is vertical you know 100 percent we have to go all the way to the parent container which is what which is the app right so if we go to our app the css and we set the app we're going to say hey hey the app right that's going to be our app yep the app hey the app let's make that to be a height of you know 100 vh okay 100 vh okay right so that's going to be a height of 100 vh that's going to make the whole app and so then at that point what's going to happen so that's going to now make the whole app vertical height 100 which is good all right and then yeah yeah yeah dude yeah yeah so now you make some now the header okay that's going to be your flex item and then this item is also going to be your also flex item so if we have the headers just and that's just being at the top you know that's just at the top okay what can we do to this to take up the rest of the space what can we do here so the header and the header is at the top correct yep right that's going to take up as much space as it wants to this other container though we want this to take up the the rest of the space so what do we do we could do a height of a hundred percent well no but we're using flex remember we're using flex okay so here app yeah i'm gonna say display next i'm gonna say display flags here on the app okay so let's play flex okay yeah right and i'm gonna say what i'm gonna say flex direction and then we can reaction column right because that's gonna be stacked column now okay yeah good so i'm gonna save that i'm gonna save that now i'll go back to app.js now the header this is fine div class app this is fine let's actually go back to um the main container and remove that 100 vh for a second here okay let's go to main computer css yup actually where did you put the 100 vh on which side was it app sidebar we put a sidebar height of 100 v8 yeah right there right there so let's run it for here for a second just just for a second here okay okay i'm gonna save that here and then let's go back to um app.js okay okay and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna set this app page this app page to be a to be what to be what flex what we'll set out to be uh so what do we say to one to use up the rest of the space right exactly exactly to one right okay so flex one nice okay now check this out so let's go ahead and save this let's go take let's go ahead and take a look at what we actually get cool man i didn't oh because i always run into this issue as well refresh it did it yes or no refresh it on my main screen is actually taking effect but on this screen it's not so on my big screen is this so you see we can't actually scroll right yeah there you go and so now it's fully 100 100 vertical height and you know and it's going to take as much space as it wants to and it's going to be very dynamic that's the really cool part about it nice okay i mean on the smaller screen i'm not sure maybe this one's not caching or something but if you can just refresh it yeah if you check on your oh there we go yeah so it was caching there you go yeah there you go you see that guys like it's actually now no longer scrolling because we said the entire container has a view that's so cool nice i didn't actually know that i actually yeah yeah yeah like um i actually end up like doing sort of a flex sort of hacky way of doing that but that's that's a really clean way of doing that yeah yeah you you have to start flex from all the way to the top of the page when you do that when you start with losing flash from top of the page then everything can trickle down very easily oh nice that's actually saved me a bunch of headaches guys if you found that useful as well smash the thumbs up button because that was actually new for me as well that was nice okay awesome so now we have a very nice sort of layout so this is looking sort of much more um closer to sort of the youtube like obviously the design's a bit different but it looks like it's getting there you know it's somewhat getting there right so now let's go ahead and create the cards i guess right okay we can create the card yeah we can get the cards here that's fine but okay okay yeah i should like yeah let's do that i agree with you there yeah i'll do that so some kind of caught outline at least oh god awesome no don't go into that yeah thank god it popped up on a different screen right right so now what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and do um right so the cards right so the cards are in the main container so we go inside here this is where the videos go so basically what we want to do is um can you notice how inside of this right here so i mean we could do this two ways right we can actually have it so it could be like flex wrap and it would kind of just like the card components would get stacked up so imagine we what we want to do here guys is kind of draw so i'll just draw it out so like imagine we had one of those cards here another card here another card here and basically what we could do here is we could basically have it so that if there's enough room for another one it would just show it here or we could do it as fixed what do you think knows i would say i would say let's keep it to like three like or how much does youtube have in terms of like uh so usually i mean so let's do four let's just keep it at four let's just keep it so we won't okay let's do four yep so let's do that so so now what we can go ahead and do is let's go ahead and actually make a component for this we could say should we call it like the so this is actually sort of is it's a sort of thumbnail i guess but it's not just a thumbnail it's the entire sort of card should we call it like a video card maybe yeah let's do that i like that i like that i like that let's do a video card yeah video card something like this right so video card yeah we go inside of our files and we can go ahead and do something like this video card.js and remember guys what you want to do is i'll just make this a bit clearer so we do rfce and then boom we get the video card and then remember guys so i like to sort of like roughly address sort of like what it would look like inside of the code here so if we look at the youtube app we have a thumbnail so we have the sort of the image itself so we have this right here the image then we have like a title then we have the sort of um the channel name and then we have how many people are watching and then we have we can ignore the live now because this isn't on every single one so we just kind of want to want this as the bare minimum and we also got on the left side you see we've also got an image here right so we've also got images so there's a bunch of things there's a one two three four five different things right right so if we want to go ahead and put this inside of our app what we can kind of do is we can we can think of this as being the props because we're going to pass these in as props so we can destructure at that point and we can say right it's going to have a thumbnail url right is for the picture it's going to have a title it's going to have a channel name so like a channel name a number of views so like number of views and then what else hold on let me see and we also had like the i guess it was like the the the the channel your that channel image url or something you see yeah yeah channel you could just say channel image right yeah channel imagery that makes sense and then and then another thing is like i know if we want to put that in but i was gonna say it's gonna be like when it was actually posted uh like four years ago two years ago yeah yeah so in this case should we do it as a string maybe yeah yeah uh well it's probably just gonna honestly it's probably going to be a date the way i see it might just be um for easier for easiest use for easiest use it might just yeah let's just keep it as a string for easiest using yeah yeah when we do the full youtube clone what we'll do is we'll actually go ahead and do it as a date and then it will actually determine yeah based on that date how many months back and we can have a database and stuff behind it but for now what we can say is maybe like posted uh yeah posted date yeah just put yeah like date and we'll just keep it as a string for now yeah so today right so then that's cool and now what we can do is guys what i actually like to do here is you can actually go ahead and give it like some uh actually we won't do that i mean you could give it some default no let's not do that because it might confuse people okay so we've got the video card here and let's go ahead and give it a class name for the parent so this one could be called just video card to go with bam and guys if you're wondering what i'm doing the bem is the naming convention that we're following for css right so just in case you're wondering it's something which i recommend everyone sort of learns because it's really handy especially when you're doing sort of component based work um nice but then what we need to do is go ahead and create the video card video card mmhmm video card dot css like this right mmhmm that nice and now what we can do is let's go ahead and go to uh we need to import this file so import video card dot css like that right nice um okay cool so with that done what we can now go ahead and say is remember guys that what we were doing before was just kind of drawing like these imaginary borders around everything and it kind of makes life a bit easier when you're sort of figuring out what everything looks like so in this case i'll do the same i'll say video card should have a border of a one pixel solid black all right nice okay and then like obviously nothing's rendering here because we actually have we're not actually pulling it in so if we go to our main container we actually sort of import the video card so you see like actually if i do that control spacebar trick it just auto imports which is really nice save it and now if we go back you can see okay so there is a con there is something there with a border black but it's just like oh it's just really small yeah so right now if we actually go to the video card there's it's just an empty div which is why it looks like a line mmhmm right but what we could do is we could hit we could go ahead and say like give it give it like give it like a height maybe no just give like or any height or okay if you put something in you could just say like uh yeah yeah a video card i um a video card like this so i'm a video card right this is the beauty of sort of the using components guys it's like now like if you just do like a bunch of video cards you can see like i'm a video card i'm a video i'm pretty good right so now we're gonna get this to look something like this right there's something along that so obviously it looks like a long way off but we'll get there very long way off yeah it looks it looks really far away but we'll get that the reason why i was thinking maybe do a flex wrap is because when we do um but then i guess we want it to look like the youtube app right so yeah i mean i mean look i mean i i think when we get to like using that yeah we can do like flagstrap that's fine like when we get to actually yeah that should be fine yeah yeah yeah so now we can say is um okay so we've got this is where the videos go video card okay well first of all so we got the video card right so we got the video card but it's currently like in a column fashion should we change that to go back to like a roll fashion yeah so that it's like one after the one one to the other let's do that yeah let's do that um so i guess like in this case are we gonna manually just say that there's going to be a row and then we'll say a second row a third row or how should we do that um so okay so this is this is actually interesting so actually i've kind of done that so okay so this can be a little bit like you do not have to specify a row yeah you just simply specify you spin simply specify um the flex number like zero for example if you want four items right and four items in one row you say you set a flex um you said a flex of wait what is one divided by four 100 divided by four that's 25 right yes yeah so you you said flex 9.25 to every single item nice yes okay and then you can change it actually and you can change that uh and then what you can actually see there's another thing you can use but there's nothing you can use to actually very nicely evenly space them but we'll talk about that later later in a second here oh okay i see what you're doing here yeah yeah nice so what we do is we're going to main container guys and we basically want to make this main container have that display flex right so that's going to have display flex and as soon as i hit save notice what happens so let's go over to this screen and we do this and as soon as i hit save it's going to go all into a row oh oops hit save on that one nope yeah and you see it goes into a row right nice nice so the first thing i want to do is actually go ahead and get rid of the this h1 because that's a bit confusing so now we actually have i'm a video card i'm a video kind of a video card now yeah as you mentioned like each of the children right so each of those video cards if we gave them 0.25 then it should thicken up like 25 of that main container right exactly exactly exactly so if we go over to that video kind of we say flex of 0.25 and guys this is insane because like once you get used to flexbox like one rule actually does all the layout for you know it solves all the headache of getting everything so i can see some people saying use calculate size and number of elements don't do any of that that's like an oldschool way of doing it flex handles all this for you so like if i as soon as i hit save watch what happens so this is applying the flex 0.25 so as soon as i hit save nice right nice nice nice 9.25 and then and then we can average and now let's say we can make this um i don't know i forgot what it is but what i think so we got the 9.25 now we want to do is you see how the height of it is like a hundred percent yeah we want to we want to stop it from we want to stop that from um basically you know extending all the way to the bottom yeah we want to just keep it to it it's normal height yeah so how do we do that so you can do a max height right you can do a max height yeah you can do a max fight true wha what other way were you thinking maybe uh well i mean i was thinking max i was asking you oh okay so you see here guys the way i like to sort of roughly figure it out right is i'll go here and inspect it and i can see like there's got a height of i think that's i can't is it a height in width or is it width tonight i think but it's roughly around 260 right so 260 is roughly sort of the height there so what we could do is we can go ahead and actually say like a max height of 260. um and what we can do is we get a rough sort of idea of the video card so if we go into the video column we say set a max height of like 250 pixels and then i hit save let's go back to the you can see as soon as i hit save boom there you go nice nice nice nice nice and okay okay great so actually actually another way you can actually do that um to prevent the height if you actually even remove the height if you set at the parent to be a line item for example like center like if you do a line item center on the parent it should not basically like the height would like basically the high would would stay to its normal position to to fit the content so you mean okay so what we're saying is apparent so here main container okay yeah yeah if you go to make it if you said for example align items right and you set that to be for example like center right yeah so as soon as i hit or let's yeah or let's say align items um top flex start right flex start yeah so as soon as i do yeah okay okay okay you see so now the height of those cards are only the height of the actual content i did not know that as well okay nice i'm learning it's actually good stuff like it's a flex master class all right nice [Laughter] so here we go this is the best part guys like about like learning together is i get to learn a lot of stuff from sunny sunny gets to learn from me like it's like this is the like when you have such amazing team guys of you know people are just doing things people creating things you just get to learn a lot from each other you get each other's energy it is beyond epic like i'd say i just want to mention that it's just it's so awesome exactly guys like it's all about like finding like amazing team and like even pair programming like what we're doing right now like that's the way you really learn and like you kind of accelerate your growth as a developer so definitely worth doing and definitely use vs code live share like me and us doing right now yeah yeah yeah so now let's go ahead and let's go ahead and actually sort of put in like a dummy i guess right so we'll have something like it's like an image here and then the image source would be the thumbnail url right so let's go ahead and put the thumbnail url and then we'll have a um so remember guys like the actual layout of everything so in this case you had like the the uh image at the top and then you had like everything so imagine this is kind of like two containers right mmhmm we have one here and then we have this one underneath it right right containers so we can go ahead and separate that now at this point so we can go ahead and say um we could say video card so div i mean like we could just have the image as the top element and then the bottom one inside of its own containers we could say video card info something or video card yeah video just say like video card info yeah that's that's fine yeah yeah and then that way guys everything underneath there so this is actually sort of two children now so if we actually minimize this you can see like it's actually two children so like this is the parent and then we've got one child two child and then video card we can give it a type of um display flex and what i like to do here is to make sure that it uses up the correct sort of spacing as a flex direction column and then i think it will give it if you gave flex direction column you can go ahead and do 50 0.5 0.5 in it because you see should we do it that way or should we just do it as we need it um let's do it as we need it because yeah yeah let's do it as we need it because that might be unnecessary right now so yeah go back here and you can see okay it's a video card info right okay so and now we have the image there and then in here in the video called info so now guys this is another question so you can see now over here we actually have sort of all of this information so all of this information in one sort of container and then we have this thumbnail on the left or like this sort of icon over there on the left yeah right yeah and the reason guys the reason the reason why we see that right is because you know we see things in rows and columns right if you look at for example you know if you look at for example the the thumbnail that is a column to the right of the thumbnail right where all the text is that's another column right so you'll be but that's how you know as kind of sunny is highlighting it's two different columns and then within those columns you have different rows and then more columns right but the way that the way that we see when when we look at these things in terms of structure we always like to see them in terms of rows and columns because that is how the web is built guys okay exactly the web is just a bunch of rectangles that's all i can say literally that exactly that yeah like and then if you give it the correct flex rules it kind of figures out all the spacing itself yeah exactly exactly yeah so here what we can do is so you can see it's like a container with two sides so we're going to have like the icon and then here's going to be like the info sort of text i guess so yeah you know as we go back to our code and now we can see like we've got here oops we're doing that so i can say here we can say let's create a div and let's have let's have on the left side we can have an image so this image would be the sort of channel image url and on the right side we say div video card so video card and then bem so the element we're talking about is info text so that'll be all the other stuff right yeah yeah well the other text so you see that now we've got another two children inside of video called info right so in here we would have the title of the video so we'd have let's just call it let's just say a p let's just say the title so we'll have the title okay um then we'll have the so let's go back and check so we've got the title then we've got the number of chat no channel name sorry yeah you're right channel name yeah so here will be a channel name next and then here we can say p and then the number i think it's used number of views yeah yeah yeah number of views and then we've got the posted date so we can do this again boom boom nice nice nice nice nice beautiful guys beautiful and now you can see right now it's sort of like obviously it's going to be empty because we've sort of changed everything to actually take the props that we pass in but the actual when we render the components we don't actually say what the props are right so exactly let's go ahead and actually get some sort of dummy data now so for the first one what we can do is we can kind of just go ahead and grab like let's go ahead and grab a dummy thumbnail or something so let's just say thumbnail uh youtube oh oh man be careful the images yeah there we go we got lucky there so copy the image yeah yeah yeah i'm just gonna pass that in as one so we can do that and then we can see immediately look that's it like a thumbnail i mean it's huge but we can resize all this stuff um then we can go ahead and say the title of this video could be something like uh test video something like that or just like yeah let's just call it test video um and then you've got the also you've got the channel name so channel name we can call this one clever programmer mmhmm yeah and then we also have let's say um he posted oh no number of views yeah a number of views and all of views yeah yep and here we could say five million yeah yeah we can say let's say like 5.2 million views there you go nice and then we can say um the posted number eight oh sorry so so number of views would actually just be a number i guess right and then we would render it with i mean you could do it either way yeah it could do it yeah for now let's just keep it simple man we'll just keep it yeah where's that here we could go ahead and do something like um so oops what was the posted date it was just something like close today let's do like three days ago yeah three space days slash ago yeah beautiful yeah and now guys you can see there we go we have like a very small sort of like test video clever programmer 5.2 million views and three days ago and that thumbnail is doing really well right now apparently yeah nice guys give us a thumbs up for the thumbnail guys who likes that thumbnail you know yes it took 5.2 million views nice so we've already created a video called css so here we can see a video called css and then like for this image right so what we can go ahead and do is give this one a class name a class name and then we'll just close one video card thumbnail like that thumbnail um and then we can style this one because right now that thumbnail is huge right so what we can do i think we can actually say if we do width 100 is it gonna it should fit inside of its container there we go yeah yeah the parent had a 0.25 sort of rule being applied and then we said yeah to the image only use up 100 of what you're allowed to basically so it's only yeah what it should be that's the correct way of doing it guys like if you do it any other way you kind of you're going to run into a corner case where it's going to be like some headache or something you've got to deal with and it's also yeah like if you resize it you see that you kind of solve that issue so ignore that border problem we'll fix that in this afterwards yeah yeah but for now okay so yeah cool um i think i think that's maybe um so so go with that okay we're good with that pretty much yeah so now let's go ahead and add the image so the sort of thumbnail um as in the channel image url so i think okay using avatar or something like avatar so well i think do we not have a clever pokemon hold on let me see oh yeah i might have i think i just i can just give you a clever programmer one hold on copy image copy image and then oh there we go yeah just copy yeah just download on those yeah and grab this one yeah nice okay so so we can go ahead and we want this one to go like somewhere um like here so we wanted to kind of go on this left side right yeah what we can do is we can go into our video card.js and we can basically say so that's this one here so we need to go back into and drag that here let's go back here and we can basically say that the channel image url should be this one i don't know if that's a correct oh wow that's not that's a holly doesn't it holy molly oh right man he is oh yeah okay there you go okay and you see like right now i mean like it doesn't look like it guys but if we inspect this it actually has got like a sort of round sort of border so you see that border now do you know a shortcut for getting it to sort of make a circle out of that oh yeah i do yeah so oh yeah what we can do here is let's go ahead and target that so uh i'll show you i'll show you guys a different way of targeting so you either can do this right we can give it a class name or you can actually go ahead and say like for example in this case we're going to go inside the video card info so video card info here and then we can say target the the direct child which is an image yeah so are we are we trying to get a border around that image we're trying to get a border or we're trying to have it where it's just a circle um so you know how they have it here so in youtube yeah oh it's like a little circle right yeah so right now i mean the only reason ours looks like a circle is because it is actually a picture of a circle a circle but it feels like a square image we kind of want to crop out the circle right yeah so how do we go ahead and do that so what we would do and okay so i'll take over here for a second here so what we would do is if we go to our our what what is it called not the sidebar the main container is in the main container yeah there we go if you are in the main container right right here okay and if we look at our video card so let's go to our video card here for a second here um actually oh did you save the video card yep my name okay okay so the em so this image right in order for us is to basically to have this image kind of like um be you know the full the full width and just be in a circle one way to which you can do that is if you actually have a parent div so if you have a parent div here's why here's why because you can have the parent div control the circle right the parent div is going to control how it looks like right the parent div is going to be border radius the parent dave is going to create the curvature okay and then anything that's within it is just going to fit that curvature nice so check this out so if i go in here for example right and i say and i and i put this in right just like that and then for this div let's just say the class name and we're going to follow i'm going to follow try the bamboo so this is what it's called video card right video is that right yep so video card underscore underscore info right yep underscore underscore um uh channel image uh container oh okay so this is a good rule sorry guys about them so the reason why you use members so you don't get this nesting because in sas you get this like nested nested nested approach right so here yeah because it's already inside of this child what you would do instead is you would actually go ahead and say um so in this case something like channel image container so you could say you could say channel image so you'd say here you would just do this you'd do something like this because these are meant for villains uhhuh and then basically based on its position would be the sort of i know i know your point for this but you could do like if you want to do it you could do it something like this info channel image container oh really okay gotcha gotcha gotcha okay okay okay really long nest in sas used to get this yeah yeah yeah yeah uhhuh so we just keep it as that like video video card channel image container like that yeah with the camera casing there you go beautiful okay so so if i go ahead and do that and then and now i'm going to go ahead and copy this specific div right okay and then i go to video card as css and then if i target that specific div now so let's go ahead and do um dot video card image container right yeah all i have to do is i do so so i'm gonna let's go ahead like what height and width do we want to like set for that like what is the height of like a thumbnail that we want to use like go ahead and inspect so this double check so we can go ahead and do this we can say inspect and the way i would check that height is i would click this little inspector tool and then go here and you see when it hovers over it says it's 36 by 36 okay so let's do so okay so we're gonna we're gonna do height height is 36 pixels 36 pixels and then the width is also going to be 36 pixels right okay right so we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna keep it uh basically a square okay and then what's going to happen guys now how do we so if this is a screen let's just say i'm gonna set a border for now i'm gonna say border and i'm gonna say one pixel right solid and i'm to say this is going to be orange because why not because orange okay and if we save that and we can go back to go can we go back to what the output yep so we can go and check out okay so you can see you can see that you see that the orange and in that thumbnail it does not really it's not really fitting that specific border right it's just it's outside of that right so what we will do what we will do is we will do for this specific one for this image we will say uh we actually we don't want to use uh that what we will do instead is we'll do it like hold on we'll do a video image container okay right inside here and then we'll target the image just like you did before right because now because the image why because the image is within this video card channel image container so on this side we will now set the width to be a hundred percent yep a hundred percent and that's pretty much it right so with a hundred percent okay okay okay so yeah so now we have in a circle right but look but you see the border the border is the bounding box so it's not a circle yet because if we put something that's not a circle it's just gonna take up the whole space nice so what do you think we should do guys in order to be to have it be like a circle like what do you think we should do drop it in the comments below well check this out check this out here's what we'll do if we go back to the code we want to create that curvature that full curve that's a circle the only way for us to create a circle with a a deal is we by simply setting the border radius okay oh fifty percent okay and that is it so save that now go back to that nice you see now it's a circle right so then and then so okay now check this out you see how sometimes the orange thing is like shows up and doesn't so here's what we do the reason why the reason why why do you guys think that the orange shows up on the top and left and right but does not show up you know on the curvature why pretty happy i think i feel like i know this one so so now okay so what we want to do now is we actually go let's go back to the code here for a second okay but you actually want to go ahead and we do want to do overflow hidden okay so save that nice so what's going to happen so check this out so what this what this does now basically is anything the image the image if the image tries to go uh you know above above that specific thing um you know above that container it's it oh yeah overflow any overflow hidden it's it's going to basically hide it so yeah that and that's pretty much it man that's awesome dude that was nice and look guys you can see like if we just exaggerate the background here see red like you can see like it's actually the bounding sort of container here actually has like a red outline so that's just showing you that the container is actually sort of cropping the image inside of it right so like is that yeah yeah and then we're saying anything that kind of goes over or spills over it don't show it that's what overflow hidden exactly exactly it's like a it's like a css crop automatically exactly so when you're actually doing that i'd really recommend this line right here but then once you're done you can actually go ahead and comment this out and then you get this sort of container and then what you can do is just to double check that everything's still good if you go ahead and do this but you actually inspect the channel um i know i won't actually show you okay so yeah when you're when you're developing it i would definitely recommend you keep this right yeah yeah and then yeah because in in youtube they don't actually have like a a sort of border around it so use this to make sure that you've set it up right and then afterwards then you can sort of comment this out i'll just actually keep this maybe comment it out and you can kind of just come back and test it out that's nice yeah so that's pretty much how any any circle is like built right now any any circle you guys see on the internet that's that's how it's built just through that that's actually really cool and honestly guys these are things which are like i i honestly like no it's like on off the top of your head how many times do you sort of remember these things do you ever find that you have to like go back and check up on it or like you know google it or yeah i mean after you do it like 50 times then no right after you do like 50 times because you have to like you know repeat repeat repeat repeat then you kind of know the process yeah right but but yeah obviously i still have to go back sometimes you know we all still i mean sonny you as well right you have to go back and i you know i i always have to go back and google and search some things up you know you know like for example like you know how to set a border like how to set a border sometimes the most basic the basic stuff we forget but you know like i've literally had points where i'm like oh how do i get a circle like how do i do this like so guys if you do run into that issue it's completely normal like it's completely idea so now we have another issue right so we obviously have like the sort of everything we've built here but remember guys everything that we sort of look at is like right now it's display block right now to fix this very easily nozzle what could we do here oh no uh well guys what do you think what do you guys think we can do yeah what are you guys thinking about comment let us know what you guys are thinking yeah how can we get this looking like like pretty much how youtube have it in this scenario so how can we get it something like this so instead of like how we had it we we want it essentially in this way but in our app right now it's completely the opposite is a columnar sort of view yeah yeah and look i think i think you guys got enough time to answer so hopefully you got that right but what is the answer sonny so what we can use is flexbox we can go ahead yeah baby exactly so here we have the video card info so we can go ahead go back here drop in a rule we say apply display flex display flex and then what we can do is before i save that we can go ahead and show the actual output so we can say this and i'll notice guys what happens over here so if i zoom in we can show this and now i'm going to do is go ahead and save so i'm applying this rule so display flex and look what happens there you go nice boom right there guys and what we want is we want the sort of this container right here to actually go ahead and use up as much room as it kind of needs i think at this point right now because then yeah we can see like it takes up pretty much the rest of the container right so what we can do is we can go ahead and give that thing so in this case let's go back to the code we can go ahead and give that container so in this case the video card info text gives flex one exactly nice nice nice nice nice and that will go ahead and now it's actually got this sort of imaginary sort of that you won't be able to see it but if we went ahead and sort of demoed it as quickly like border one big saw pixel solid yeah and then you guys will see that it's actually using up the rest of it right nice yeah yeah yeah beautiful pretty much why we want to do that so now we can actually go ahead and sort of get the styling it to the point where we want it so uh so guys this is your this is your youtube clone now this is it exactly we're done now we've got the image we've got the navigation bar i gotta say what else do you need i think at this point everyone's being a bit fussy it's already there you know i'm pretty much done so this one we what i like to do is to sort of like show you guys in a quick way like i just go here i pretty much grab this and then here you can actually go ahead and inspect the sort of styling that they've used sometimes it is nested sometimes you have to sort of dive deep but in this case you can see like they have 1.4 ram um okay so it's being a bit slow but 1.4 ram line height so we don't really care about all this too much but why basically do is we can kind of just mock it and we can kind of get a bit closer in this case let's go back to our app and we can see here we want to kind of get this one so this is 1.4 ram so let's go ahead and do this so what we can do to make life a bit simple we can do class name video card and here we can say let's just call the info title last name and let's just copy this and we can rename them in a sec groups and then this one would be channel name so channel name this one would be number of views and the final one will be posted date posted date there we go nice all right so we have those right and basically firstly let's go ahead and install the uh title so the title in this case would be something along the lines of let's do this oops okay that's not what we want it okay oops i've copied the wrong thing i'll copy the entire line card title there we go and we can say the font size we saw was 1.4 ram so font size was 1.4 ram and if we go ahead and save that you see like it's a little bit bigger nice nice nice uh you could probably make it like a fontweight bold like maybe maybe make it a little bit more bolder yep so you can say font way uh it's just too bold let's have a seat let's see what that looks like okay nice yeah okay yeah so then what we can do is guys you can constantly go back and forth and you basically just want to keep doing it until you get like a perfect sort of middle ground because sometimes like you see like if we zoom out yeah right like and then we actually go back like you see like it it's it all depends on how far you're zooming in as well like it changes the sort of look of it you see that like it does change and rem is also taking into account the parent container right yeah so in this case what we could do instead is maybe find a fixed sort of middle ground just for now or something like that we could do something like what do you think or would you should we stick yeah do 20 pixels do that do that because then like yeah i'm not really sure and they might they might be confused by what rem is yeah exactly so in this case 20 pixels looks pretty much like along the white lines like yeah okay so yes we're getting sort of somewhat close okay yeah so then the next one so the rest of it kind of has like a very similar sort of color so it's like a gray and it's a bit smaller so no actually is it the same it's the same size really i think it's the same size uh it's just gray right so it's gray yeah and then we sort of it's great it's a bit smaller i would say it's like 16 pixels maybe yeah so yeah maybe i don't know yeah okay yeah let's try it we'll see let's try it so in this case what we can go ahead and do is a video so let's go ahead and do channel name so here here called channel name and here we can say font size uh let's do 16 pixels and let's do color and when you're sort of testing out guys you can just did you go ahead and do that i just test that with the default naming one so like light gray sort of restaurant you see like it's a bit too light so we can go ahead yeah great but actually no i'll show you something really cool here so i use a color picker tool so nice um really handy one that i use um uh so like let me go ahead and bring it or we can even do expect element inspect them on the actual on the actual text and then get the actual color that's in the styles no all right there you go let you see it sir so it says 60 60 60. oh dang i love that last night what was that huh that's just by clicking the inspect so you see this if i click the uh select a target to inspect and then you hover over and it actually should i didn't know that oh my god 14 pixels look 14 pixels and this one is 14 pixels as well no way i did not know that this whole time as well i'm like look it even tells you like accessibility it tells you man that's cool this it's the little things that excite us man you know exactly that's cool so right now we can go ahead and that's that's so handy wow like i mean yeah tick tock clone so in this case we could say this one is um 60 60 60 and you see that's like a perfect gray the one that we saw and the font size was uh was it 14 pixels right yeah and this one was also 14 pixels um if we save it now and look at that you can see it's actually a lot more it's actually quite close to like what we were seeing before so now you see the colors they're actually pretty close like the colors are actually pretty close yeah yeah right so now we've also got the watching and the sort of views so oh no sorry we're not using watching here we're using it like this so say something like uh two million views and it's got this little dot and then it's got this sort of three weeks ago sort of text so um i just want to grab that dot i mean i can't be bothered to find out where that is so how do we get that little dot oh man they've used it it's actually just text yeah so it's just a little text right or they use that they use it after but you don't need to use an after guys for that i'd say in this case you could do something like this so they you can actually put that inside of i mean we could just do it in one line really yeah i mean we could i mean if you want to put the dot in if you want to put the dot in sunny just cut literally copy the dot like highlight the dot and then copy from from from youtube like highlight it highlight the dot and literally just copy it no because it's an after tag you can't copy after tags no no okay all right yeah so if we could literally go into google and just type in dot i think yeah give us a dot um okay symbol oh yeah oh oh oh whoa where is this coming from what's going on oh man [Laughter] a lot of things happening all at the same time so you could do this you can add it in there there we go nice you can see a number of views and then it's posted date right and we can just change our sort of css around that so we can say this is going to be number of views and post let's just do this for now posted it all right so here we have the number of views and yeah so number of views was when we passed in so it would say something like 5.2 million views and three days ago so if we go back right thing there we go nice hey look at that damn right so now what we can go ahead and do is we can go and style that a little bit so let's go to video card and we say number of views and posting date and here we can say color um yeah we just use the same color yep so this one and even the font size we could do this yeah and now nice okay so we've got this dope nice nice nice um and getting it to look as much as we okay so right so i think at that point oh man youtube's taking ages to load up uh because i have refreshed it and some reason the internet's i think they are oh yeah there we go all right so there is a little gap still guys that we want to account for so we can handle that gap in a few ways so you can see over here we've got like a little gap underneath the first bit of text so we can add a margin bottom to fix that right so here what we can do is we can actually go ahead and add a margin bomb um to our thing so we can go ahead and say title and we can give it oops and this should be not be pixel pixel here we can say margin bottom probably like eight pixels or something probably eight so as soon as i save that now we can actually go ahead and see um react up there we go so as soon as i save look what happens it it will push it down a little bit there we go there we go all right nice uh maybe a bit too much maybe it's like maybe it's like six i don't know yeah so six nice and then let's do a quick comparison so okay i think that's yeah i like that i like that it's pretty close and to be fair what we could do is we can actually go ahead and check so we can actually click this and all right now so they've spaced it out differently so you can actually see the spacing yeah okay so in this case we're just going to roughly sort of figure it there's that's pretty cool yeah and then we've got a gap here so we also want to account for that so now what we're going to target is actually the video card info container so the actual container itself right and what we can say is we can give that one i think we can give this actually um let's go ahead and do this here so we can say we do margin top of like 20 i don't know 10 pixels and let's go ahead and show before we save it so let's go ahead so right now you can see there's no gap it's just sort of touching nearly pretty much so as soon as i hit save there we go we get like a little gap right nice so that's pretty much it i think it's a bit larger they got maybe like 15 pixels no i think yeah yeah i think it should be fine i actually looked at their css they actually have a margin top of like 12 only so yeah yeah let's go ahead and give it 12. okay nice so 12. um and then you see here guys like this has got so this is going to touch the left side so this is good but here this inner text right so we can either apply some padding to this and it's all margin left to this text so sort of this container or we can give a margin right to this image but i think in this case it'll be simpler just to add uh margin left to this stuff right here so yeah in our code it's called info text so sort of the one that we're looking at is info text which is wrapping all of that stuff and if we go here to info text and we say margin left i think it's 12 pixels 12 pixels nice so we save that and you can see now it's no longer touching right so yeah there you go if i undo that and i show you guys so if i undo that so go back to the code and i save it you can see it textures and then if we redo it we can see it's a margin of 12 pixels boom yeah yeah no not touching nice we're not going to worry about this eps uh where you basically have a continuation uh that's just like an extra thing even the three dots because that's sort of a perfect um but like you guys can take it further and you guys can mess around this is sort of an internal tool so we're just kind of getting it yeah to roughly look like the sort of youtube thing right so yeah now what we're gonna do is also can you notice how guys like it has this little spacing between the components right so to basically to be able to test this out what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and render two of these so let's go ahead and render two so let's go ahead and go to main container and rather than rendering empty stuff i'm going to go ahead and render two video cards well so let's just say like four or four of the same video yeah yeah yeah and now you see there we go right my zoom is actually messed up in this one i think so if we go ahead and go to 100 i think you have the you see the border you could probably just remove the max high border on there in the uh the border around that that thing which is creating that in inside of the video card yeah i'm very curious what's going on with that border yeah because even the the width is broken right now you see that for whatever see the width is being weird right now so like you see like what here like if i do your localhost 3000 oh no no so okay i don't know why that's happening i think it's because i'm zooming in so much right there we go so that looks really nice and that looks pretty like we're getting there now so yeah we're again there yeah that's going to look a lot more like the actual sort of app that we're going for so like if you and then even even like for example sunday if you had like a fifth one that should go to the bottom like if you had a fifth video card let's try that right now yeah so let's go ahead and try that so go to uh main container so main container.js and let's go add in a fifth and we just hit save so i'm going to hit save on that and we can see right so it's squeezed in right yeah but what we could do here is we could do a wrap i think rap would fix it yep that should fix it honestly yeah so main container is what we need to target so we've got display flex flex start um we could do here uh flex wrap and we can say yeah right as soon as i hit save now i think is this because maybe we're doing the um i think is it a line items flex start maybe no flex wrap flag zero zero point what's what's the individual flex okay so the individual video card how many do they have about flex 0.25 yeah okay um i think i think that we also have to add a flex bases as well on on the video cards as well right space yeah okay so flex basis and then i never usually add a flex basis um kind of like so let's go ahead and inspect let's see what's going on here so it's going to inspect this so here we have the video card main container and we're saying the main container has a flex of 0.8 okay it has display type flex so that's working a line items doesn't do much flex wrap doesn't do much but we're saying the video cards here should take 0.25 okay so what we could do here is rather than doing the sh there i remember this it's like um what did we do what did i do before i'm trying to remember so yeah if you have a main container so can you hover over the main container the main container div yeah okay okay and then the video card is like that can you i'm actually really curious can you try align content uh can you try adding a align content to the parent okay and try a line content with a value off a line count it a flex start so if that's gonna do the vertical alignment okay a line kind of like start just googling it as well so let's go ahead and check like flex let's just say limit thanks i do use this quite a lot as well some strange houses and so let's do this and let's just do like something i just want to check signs let's do a max width of each one so max width should be something like i don't know 30 300 pixels that yeah so if we use a max width can you see how like it does sort of like it will wrap yeah yeah right so that's like that's the sort of not so we can see our main container behavior is actually working in the way we want but the flex sort of 0.25 isn't doing exact thing that we kind of want it to here so it's not actually so we're saying that each one should be using up 0.25 but i think there's something about flex effects oh that's it we set maybe a min width yeah yeah min width is something like 25 yeah there we go we could do a min width of 25 because you're saying that otherwise they're saying that every child should get yeah it's still strange though i mean i'm sure there's like a flex grow or something here we should be using yeah but to fix it for now we could do that we can go ahead and do that and that will actually sort out in line with our rule so we're saying the video card here should actually have something like a um say a min with of 25 and if you guys have any sort of ideas around that would love to hear it because it's always interesting seeing how people use flexbox and sort of get this going you know yeah um so see so now okay that's good so we have that all right um so now i'm gonna go and do is i don't know why it comes up weird on there okay so let me go ahead and actually i'm just sorting out the screen so that way oh somebody mentioned flex shrink okay you move if you do flex strength zero actually so actually try that i'm just really curious like if you on the video card um if you remove the max width and you just do a flex shrink of zero okay so video card flex shrink of zero so flex shrink but that'll have to be on every single item in the video card okay so let's go to video card and then say flex shrink my uh my work might not work i'm not sure okay did it no no did not never mind interesting though i mean i feel like there is some kind of you know there there will be some kind of flex grow 25 flex shrink one yeah i think let's keep it a minute width for now like we'll we can always we can always make it better yeah but that's an interesting sort of care sort of case that you might run into so 25 yeah and that's sort of like a hack around fixing that so here the reason why i sort of doing this as well is because of um why is it spacing out weird why have we got this video card video card main container main container we've got effects effects line items effects wrap what the hell why is it coming out i have some weird like caching going on you see like if i do this now what the hell okay that's even more weird is yours coming up on localhost let's see hold on because i'm looking at yours right now hold on oh this is interesting so we have video card oh okay video card has a mate uh a max height say if we get rid of that max height no that's just a max height though yeah that shouldn't do it min width of 25 pixels okay so main container go go to main container hold on go to main container border flex align item center align items right now okay do a l do align content do a line content hold on okay so a line item should be flexed let's start select start and then do align content also do the flex turn that as well okay here here we go yeah did that work yeah so flex start align items uh i like content yeah so nice okay cool of course so uh main container i would say some somebody said space between and a minimum then get rid of effects and 1.25 okay so you can do that oh i think you know if we oh no no we do want it to be because if it's not if it's smaller you want it to grow okay perfect yeah so so now we have that okay so now what we could do is basically we need to handle the sort of margins now as well like so in this case how do we apply a margin to and without breaking that side you see what i mean we're gonna have yeah yeah so so that way so if we actually the way like so if we actually because we set the min width of like point 25 percent right yeah um if you had a margin it's going to push it down now because because so what we have to do i think is like actually initially let's go just let's just add a margin let's go ahead and just add a margin to individual video card and see what happens so margin right yeah yeah let's just say 20 pixels oh yeah oh yeah yeah okay oh wait a minute a line content flex start yeah where does that happen again so if we save this oh god okay so main container all right sorry i accidentally i put this in the wrong one so this should be i did yeah this should be a lion content should be here there we go oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah it's pushed over all right nice nice nice okay so what what do we what do we do in this case is because you guys see because we added a margin the menu with 25 right means that every single item is 25 but the problem now becomes the fact that um not everything will we won't be able to fit four items which we're supposed to right because the margin you know basically removes some of the space right so the only way for us to pretty much do this is just to actually do like a minute width like 22 percent yeah no you're right because otherwise you're going to get into this weird situation where yeah so if you try like maybe with like 22 or something something like that like 22 percent or um there you go so like that but you see like then the right i am so in this case um i think okay for now i think that's fine we could go with that yeah yeah we can approve that because what we can do yeah because then you could go further and do like rows and stuff like that but for this tutorial i think it's going to be good because this is just to get a rough demonstration of what it's going to look like so yeah it's a min width of 22 hits the sweet spot so 22 nice okay now also notice how in the youtube app they're not touching right so they're not touching they have that little gap here right so what we can do now is we can actually add a margin underneath each video card which would sort of fix us you can say margin bottom and we can add like a slightly bigger one so 30 pixels or something you see like there so if we go ahead and save that now nice we get like a little gap there nice that's good that's good they like that so that's pretty cool so we have that up and running in the way we want it um okay that's that's really nice um okay what we can do now is the entire thing so the entire thing has like a slight gray color behind it right so you see here it has like a slight sort of gray background mmhmm what we can do is we go ahead and inspect that gray background so we can go ahead and see like what i would do so i'll show you guys the tool that i use so i use this little pipette thing okay called colorzilla and you click it and you click pick color from the page that sounds so that sounds so epic color zillow you know like godzilla yeah you know yeah exactly then you get this sort of weird sort of like little thing pop up this little sort of and then basically you just go ahead and you see it pops up at the top and you just find it and you click it and then what you'll do is it'll color the actual hexadecimal code so now if i go back to my thing and we go to the main container the background color and we set that to what i just copied that's just the white color though um oh god that's white yeah but you see there's a gray right yeah it's a great yeah bell so so my my color picker failed me guys let's try again your color your color picker is color blind you know i know i like it's like this is trying to figure out what the hell is going on like okay so i'm not even popping up at this point okay wait so we have okay so there you go that's like a yeah yeah that that's better that's better if i go over here okay it's freaking out guys give us some applause for the color picker yeah this is hilarious let me go ahead and we go oh i haven't looked oh my god oh i did an applause but because you're on the wrong screen it didn't do it it was muted oh really yeah wait wait round the boat good job so now let me go back and see hey did that apply uh yep yeah looks like it's there right is there yeah it's just yeah i think very light yeah and guys just to exaggerate what we've just changed there so if i go ahead and change it to red you see that that's what we were sort of going for like that background we're just giving it like that looks horrible okay so back to very subtle gray behind it right yeah okay nice um and now what we're going to do is i actually have some let me turn off my flux so this is like it saves your eyes when you're working late oh yeah okay so now what we're going to go ahead and do is actually add some padding to this but you see like in their section they have something like recommended right it says recommended at the top so you see it says yeah we could do that could you recommend it yeah that's fine so we could go ahead and like add something like that but in this case i guess like where we have it here main container so this is actually sort of the main container is actually sort of responsible for everything so what we could do here is we could kind of rename main container to oh no not rename so we could we can what do you mean no if you wanna if you actually are you talking about like um are you talking about like uh you wanna add a recommended text is that what you wanna add yeah i mean just add it add it to the parents no add it to where you have the them so here right so yeah yeah so it's like here so sidebar ah actually this is how this does have to be inside the main container my bed you're right you're right you're right yeah you're right maybe do something like um just click into this we could do something like every rule we've it's only this one so that's fine we could do this we could say main container um let's create a div so we can say div and this is going to be this is going to be the actual main container and that's going to have everything here copy that paste it inside there and this one we can say main container videos and then we could rename that to videos and then the main container would basically so now you see the app hasn't actually changed but the height would have changed yeah in a sec main container here we can say is um oh right is that because of the flex 0.8 and everything yeah yes so now you have to keep yeah now you have to keep doing flex grow and all this stuff yeah now all right so we can do effects so main container okay sweet so hold on save that but if i want to make like oh right if i need to save this one as well yeah let's go back this let's just add a h1 saying recommended for now that just yeah recommended and then we can see so okay that's fine we can we can keep it as this this is fine because you'll remove the border and all because the gray color right is the gray color not in there oh right yeah so here so right now what we could do is we could just add this here and that would that should that should give everything agree right let's see it does it yeah we gave it yeah perfect perfect perfect it does right yeah yep yeah yeah it does yeah nice so now what we can do is we can go ahead and get rid of that border so that because we can see that it's all good um and then we can actually go ahead and sort of style it to start looking a bit more like this so at the top we have like a bit of a gap at the top so that so so firstly the size of this is really wrong so we can do is we can go ahead and inspect this you can see this one is 20 pixels and it has like a slightly gray color we can ignore the color for now just to get the first bit right so we can say firstly let's do a h2 because it shouldn't be a it shouldn't be that then we can say h2 um and let's just call it class name because we can say main container let's just call it main container title so that main container title font size is 20 pixels not kidding me i sometimes have to go to google to figure out how to do font size what's that i sometimes have to google to pick a font size i don't know why yeah oh guys just also notice how the sidebar got scrunched right yeah yeah you have to put flex on the out the actual connection yep yep beautiful yeah nice nice nice yeah good catch man good catch yeah because otherwise it doesn't tell it to correctly use that spacing yeah let's put a little bit like a margin padding into that h1 yeah so the first thing you guys notice how like so before we do the padding to the h1 let's add a padding to the overall container so you see like oh yeah like this one so let's add maybe like a 20 sort of oh should we just add a margin left i guess right yeah let's do here here let's do let's do a for now let's do a margin left and there's actually going to be and oh you see it look actually yeah well because here's the thing their margin changes so you basically they keep four tabs they keep four things open right but basically it gets scrunched up so basically the margin changes it's just that the content stays the same you know what i mean yeah but for now for now i think it'll be fine just to add some margin to the left just for now yeah so here basically we could essentially do something like spring container margin left yeah many pixels you can do like margin top as well yeah uh yeah legend top nice uh i know it's how guys so this is this is something you don't want to happen now so margin adds a spacing around it right which means that you lose the background color so in this case instead of a margin we can use padding yep we keep that background color nice nice nice and then what we do is we space out that that sort of uh the text as we want it now so the container title can have a margin beneath it so that way we can kind of space it out to look a bit like this so you can say margin bottom pixels dude i love stream deck it's so crazy wait what are you using to stream like for you like to switch windows or what no because i'm using streamlight to do all this stuff like you see like this to show oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nice nice you know um so we've got this margin top of like let's just say another 10 pixels nice okay so you can see like that's actually starting to sort of take shape to that yeah yeah we're starting to get somewhat of a shape here like to looking like that right nice uh at this point i think literally once we get the sort of implementation for this page patient i think we'll save maybe the rest of the build for the youtube clone right what do you think yeah i would yeah i would say yeah because it will probably yeah so you're saying basically let's go ahead and set up the actual um let's go ahead and set up the actual uploading of the thumbnail and then the youtube club will be later that we is though you're talking about yeah so we'll we'll get the sort of sidebar start the top bit start and we'll get the thumbnail implemented and yeah at that point i think we should leave it there and we should maybe save the rest of it so even like you know we can extend it maybe or we can maybe like create a complete youtube clone tutorial yeah guys what do you think what do you think we should do should we go ahead and create a completely like a youtube clone tutorial uh later on right and just gonna finish what we have right now or what do you think what just let us know in the comments below yeah um but i but i think yeah let's like i think um i think we could just finish up but we kind of have finished up some of the things we have right now i was i was initially thinking of doing like a twopart series video since we're doing this stuff right now super serious videos but uh we could probably do a youtube clone as well so but let's finish up let's finish up what we have right now just gonna finish those things up in terms of sidebar the navigation i think we should be good then let's do it yeah so now what we'll do is we can actually go ahead and um so we can do it so the sidebar i guess right so we should carry on signing the rest of the app so it looks somewhat in line maybe you want to do the nav let's do that first the sidebar just kind of side let's do a nap yeah you know so the logo right now looks disgusting so we have this yeah that is an a plus logo right there yeah nice so header right here but we also have to we also have to add remember we have to add a logo and we also have to add a uh um what's it called the those three three three icon thing oh yeah the the burger menu right yeah yeah yeah yeah burger menu so here we can add a image so that one image for the thing and then we could say another image uh no so this wouldn't be an image what we can actually go ahead and use is the material ui icon yeah yeah so you can go ahead and check this out and so we will get we'll use the search one afterwards but i think here we can actually say menu i think it is or not menu sounds like burger burger hey that might be i think i'm just wondering if it is it if it does come up on the burger oh it does yeah it's a menu nice oh wow yeah because i was wondering that's what i look at is old yeah so perfect uh what we can do now is we can actually pull that in so using these icons is super simple guys we can actually go ahead and do this um and if you guys are liking this smash the thumbs up by the way because it's like it's pretty cool i think like a way of doing this stuff you know like we can see how this goes and we can see like maybe we'll make more of these if it takes off or if not we can carry bones oh yeah oh guys there's so much coming oh you have no idea yeah dude we have so much planned for you guys dude wait till you come to a late sunny no dude oh man i think i feel like we're just getting i feel like then it's gonna go to a whole different level of content creation we're gonna have like think about like this right a video camera following us like so frankie's gonna have a video camera following us that's basically that's that's going to record as we're typing as we're kind of typing all on the same place yeah right oh holy can you imagine that like we'll be coding and then you've got like a dynamic dude the most epic coding ever that's what it's gonna be like literally you'll probably never see anybody called like that like like your camera panning around showing the coding you know of developers you know live on youtube and then literally i reckon we even have like we'll get all sorts of footage behind the scenes like vlog near the pool there's a pool there too uh yeah that's it oh man nice so guys we want to get the youtube logo right so that yeah where it says like let's go ahead and find youtube logo when i inspected they didn't actually pull in they pulled a weird sort of different one so we're going to go ahead and grab one from here and let's go ahead and let's see what's similar sort of closest to this let's maybe go ahead and grab this one oh dude on the right you see that on the one the right oh no that's it that's a full image never mind this one's a transparent so yeah let's use that let's use that let's grab that and then we go back to our code and you can see here image source boom there we go png nice so save that and then if you go back now you can see okay so this is good it comes up like the burger menu icon over here right nice and now big boy james says sonny where do you work clever programmer dude no he i think he meant like what country maybe like he's like in london oh okay yeah london yeah london yeah yeah we work from london nars where are you based i'm in detroit guys in detroit city that's it detroit city all right so the top okay so now we've got it named as the header so we've got the header so header logo doesn't make sense for the container we should say header left side maybe and header right yeah or header yeah yeah let the left side and header right side let's just call it like that for now header left side header right side and then the left side we have logo so now we're targeting that logo which is the image right so now if we go here and we say hello logo uh let's just nittan titan says thanks for the awesome videos you're welcome dude and even for him dinesh says love you guys with the plans you have for us uh it's always nice getting a little you know like like halfway through yeah nice yeah so header logo so now guys there's a nice trick here right so you see it's huge right so yeah the first thing i'll do is i'll actually get the rough sizing of the sort of one that they have so up here what i do is i would inspect that one and i would actually go ahead and toggle this sort of you know inspect icon thing and you can see that roughly the size is like let's just say 24 24 pixels yes oh height height is 24. so it's like high yeah so height by so 280 by 24 right yeah yeah 80 by 24 so what we could do is we can go back to our code and we can it like something like this we could say height is 24 pixels width is 80 pixels but notice how it's probably going to mess up the aspect ratio yeah yeah it gets all stretched right uh yeah yeah so a trick so guys guys actually guys um who knows who knows that guys how do you not make it be like that stretch like what what what would you do to keep it the same aspect ratio but yet still have the same height like what would you do let us know in the comments below exactly like how do you fix that issue yeah because yeah like it's quite an annoying issue as well like is in until i figured this one out it was really really sort of like painstaking to get that working yeah well like i would sort of mess around with these numbers until i had it perfect and then i think they'll drop it in the comments okay i think we can just give the answer yeah object contained that is the magic rule guys you see like it goes ahead and right now i mean that looks wait what i didn't even know that hold on what you can do that yeah i did object container i didn't know that i i thought i thought you just put the height and remove the width that that that was my that was my thing if i just object fit containers this magical rule dude like bro crazy right and like now obviously oh this why didn't they realize this picture probably has like some kind of no padding yeah maybe something has a lot of padding if we say like 30 pixels height uh or maybe let's just go away bro crazy right so you see that if i do 50 pixels higher you see it just kept it keeps the aspect ratio wow which is nice right very nice i didn't know that yeah still okay all right okay to fix this actually what we'll do is we'll set the header height so the header height on youtube is talking about this height is about maybe 50 pixels so like let's go ahead and check so let's do a height of like 50 pixels so the header so you see that now it's got like a height of like roughly the same as this and then what we can do is because right now we're doing a display flex inside of there we can say align items center and as soon as we save that you see like everything sort of like flex start now it's sort of centered at all right so it's nice which is much nicer and then what we can do is we can actually go ahead and make this one a little bit bigger now so we could say 50 or something and you see that then it sort of just fills it a bit more nice nice nice yeah so that works i don't know why the burger menu actually dropped below wait wait wait wait wait no refresh it you're cashed this is not right i don't know why my yeah it's like i think but i think that happened when i did this right because i think i actually messed i broke it when i do this you see that look then it because it's kind of pushing over into that element what this makes no sense so what we could do is firstly let's sort out the spacing and then we'll then we'll address yeah yeah let's yeah i think i think the next thing is like we need to figure out so for example like that so for example that input that search box for one is like i think that's that's in the center right that's search box and i think what we can do sunny as well is like material ui actually has a really nice search bar that we can just simply copy and actually use okay not let's just use that one because that one's much nicer than this so that one is actually let's go ahead and zoom out that one is this one here so i think it's input yes yeah it's like input now just css input based in just yeah like input that and it takes all the gameplay props uh as a normal does it really oh okay all right it just takes all the same improps and then see it just changes it to theirs but you see that the default variant looks a bit different so the variant we want so they accept a prop called variant and i think it's outlined is the one that we want so is it okay so now if you see is that sure it was outline varian i think if you do control space okay no it's not um input okay that's really not gonna help me and but go to the top so you've got all of the stuff here you've got color and they usually have one called varian i think it's called i think it's called hold on maybe it's called yeah it could be outline yeah outline should be the one yeah it's not usually something but i think it's called a text field i think it's not input it's called a text field no sunny yeah yeah yeah that's it you're right you're right you're right yeah text field api yeah this one right yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly and then you've got a variant yeah varian a outlined there you go there you go there you go yeah there's input yeah all right so let's go ahead back to the code and change input to this text field go back here to this one get rid of this and we can say variant see now it's coming up there we go equals and you see then it pops up with autofill and you can say outlined and then now we check that out so let's see refresh there we go come on let's go oh man okay it's just huge this is way too big right now uh and also the pen solder should say such just like google doc yeah so here let's go ahead and just add that in so we can say oops so place holder equals search and now if we do this and we refresh there we go okay so all my already when you add the search it kind of it makes you feel a bit more sane like it's not so ugly yeah um yeah even the icon button this let's fix that first and then we can determine that the header search size because right now it's flex one um so i think no no it's not fixed one but we can determine that in a sec so the button here um what we can actually do is set that to that icon right the hourglass icon so if we go to material ui we're doing yeah yeah material ui so we can go here we can go to search so here import search icon go back to our code and now we can do this oops import there you go search icon yeah boom now if we go back you can see that so it's got it right there right so what i like to do here to fix this sort of issue is this is all inside of header search right so header search what we could do is we can say instead of giving it so flex one is to give up all the space because it's got display flex so that way the two children including the things inside of it are going to be inside so they're going to be like sort of expect surrounding and we can say align items center yeah and then you can see it does that and then what we want to do is basically get back to this point so we want that button to have the width of see that button roughly but it's not even a button do we do we just use a button we need to create a button right oh yeah yeah yeah we need to create a button first yeah within that button right yeah yeah i completely missed that yeah so here we do to import this easier you can just do this okay and then here what we can do is we can actually go ahead and make it so we can just enroll this sunday sunday you're not showing the code or you're not sure what you're doing oops yeah yeah so guys what i was doing here is is i've done button from uh core so i've imported it from the core material ui library so you've got this we import it here go down here what i did is so get rid of this we had the search icon before what i'm doing now is instead i'm just going to do button so material ui button and then as the text will have the search icon nice nice now this would actually be a button there we go hey look at that here's a nice sort of you know outfill and then we can actually go ahead and actually make that variant an outline i think aaron is online i think maybe that would look like i would say just keep it normal i think it looks good like that no without without the outlet i mean if we get yeah i know you mean you know so let's leave it as let's give it a background gray you see like it's got that that's called gray color right because then if we check out that one it's got like a gray sort of tone to it yeah so let's go ahead and check that out and see so you got search um somewhere object fit contains and then there are emoji wash your hands what's up oh no we don't want to do that so let's just do class now and let's just do header search and here because we're actually applying a style to a material ui button we might actually have to do a special thing and in this case let's just do like gray but you have to do dash uh um exclamation mark important to override the rules so you see that then we get that yeah so light gray it's a bit too light but i mean at this point let's just get it started a bit more so it sort of looks along the right track yeah yeah yeah yeah so here we need to fix that height issue so the height issue here is because the outside container let's just say so right now the one that we're trying to get to is this right here right yeah which is the height of this one specifically is about like if you look at that maybe like 30 pixels well no no 20 that's 25 30 30 that looks like it's 32 pixels yeah so it's 30 pixels but then the border is pixel so yeah it's it's 30 pixels height yeah so if we save that now you can see will it change i'm curious actually i'm i also have a i almost feel like it won't change yeah because i feel like the text filled right so this is interesting actually let's just double check because i think materiali has like a default height no yeah i think you're right yeah it's got some default stuff you see that like inside of it yeah it's got a lot of padding holy it's a lot of petting yeah you see that so we did apply the right and that looks like the right height right but what we can do now actually go in and inside here so we can get say class name class name of header and let's just call this one the header input and you can see why bem comes in handy here as well like you say padding of zero pixels important hmm i'm trying to figure out how to set the height of a text field i don't remember let's just mess around with it here so you see they've got display input min width vertical align flex direction so padding is zero you can say margin of zero maybe no well let's just say height of 30 pixels no i mean if you if you i think it's i think it's all from the padding if you remove so if you i think the reason why it's all from the padding that's coming oh right oh it's the actual input inside of it you see that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so i think we actually have to target the input so i think what we could do maybe actually i try no no no no go back go back go back sonny go back go back you see that you see you see has padding 18.5 pixels yeah so yeah see that it gets rid of it yeah but what we can do is yeah this is nested inside of material ui's classes we can target our header input and we can say i think you can do this right yeah yes you can yes you can and then oh god that's horrible um not i would say just put padding uh for like um like um top is like i've got 20 pixels oh that's huge um a lot yeah do like 10 or five oh no okay so it's good okay it's not bad it's not bad it's kind of there eight okay seven there you go keep it there i'm good with that yeah yeah okay so so we've got that roughly the button is needs to get like the right height as well so you can say here yeah the height here is a hundred so it's 33 so we can just give the button a height of 33 sort of go perfectly now and i would say we also need to have like i have like a margin like like i might have margin right as well for the input because yeah looks like that input is not is not going to look exactly the same as that as the one that we have you mean yeah it's not gonna look exactly the same as that you know yeah we can make it look like the same but that's gonna that's gonna require custom css yeah i think for that we'll do we'll save it for the youtube clone where we go like yeah depth right like yeah let's just say 30 pixels or something like this oops no so it's not that wants to sit there here okay it's going to take a while so this is it for you okay there we go something like that for now nice yeah um for the right logos for now should we maybe go ahead and put something like um just the avatar on the right yeah but okay i mean you for example you can put you can put so hold on so on the right hand side you can just copy copy notifications logo put it in there copy a um what's it called you know and icon logo put it there and then put an avatar we could just use material ui right yes that's what i'm saying exactly oh yeah yeah yeah good good cool yeah so here we'll just do something like a an alert sort of bell or like a is it yes like something like this yeah no notification yeah there we go exactly that something like this like yeah exactly what i use so notifications icon and that can go here in the right side oops like that uh and then you can see in the right now we'll have the little bell um and then we can also have the sort of so let's go ahead and check so we've got the notification bell we've got the grid and we've got like a live right yeah so the grid can be like here we can say grid oh no oh okay you're nice yeah there you go the apps grid yeah so guys you can tell like because it's google you're going to get the exact icon set as well which is really nice yeah so that one came before that so we had this apps icon and then we also had oh oops i didn't show my code there guys i just added this apps icon to the the right side so we've got the apps icon and we've got the notification icon and then we also had the let's go ahead and check we've got the live icon right so i'm kind of live i i think it's okay that's actually like a video ad by the icons like a video but i think it's like a video icon there we go yeah nice so i got video call video call okay so we've got a video call oops nice so now we can see we should have all the icons okay but the video call came before and then we had an avatar at the end so that's pretty cool so we almost got there so now if we check out the youtube one so i mean at this point should we yeah okay so that's good yeah so i think this actually maybe focus on the functionality of so let's get rid of obviously the right logo that looks horrible so let's get rid of this big text here yep yep there we go nice nice nice nice yeah and i mean if they even have an avatar we could maybe just chuck that in there as a placeholder for now yeah i mean so hold on so if we if here's how we think about it so um how do we do this do we do we want to put now functionality into this were you actually clicking that that displays a model why do we want to do this or should we do this into like a part two what do you think i think maybe for this tutorial i mean uh maybe we should do so we should maybe we could maybe leave the sidebar as a sidebar or a placeholder yeah and we can maybe implement the modal functionality so that way we could demonstrate how you could have that inside so it's a thumbnail testing app so it's going to show roughly what it's going to look like and then we can put basically put in the dummy data but i think the actual the rest of the sort of you know like getting it to look exactly like youtube we can yeah yeah yeah so i would say let's focus on oh let's focus on the functionality or actually like bring up bringing up just a model you know and then uh is this going to work with firebase and actually saving this data or what no no so right now this is going to be all local just to sort of test what something would look like gotcha gotcha gotcha and then what we could do is actually so this is all sort of to show you guys sort of like you know like getting it set up getting everything sort of like up to this point and this and that like and there's sort of this sort of things that we experienced like when we ran into it and then what we can we could possibly like sort of finish it off and like this and then share the end result with you guys as well you know like it's sort of yeah and then the youtube clone would be like a complete build that we kind of go through yeah but but but i'm curious honey like if we if we're going to do like um um if we're going to do actual functionality of uploading like a thumbnail don't we still have to use like a firebase i know to upload to a like a a database so that we have a url to display an image no so i was thinking maybe literally we just had some kind of um uh buttons so literally like if you had imagine like a button here which says so imagine like on the third one right so like on say this let's say like here we said this one was is custom yeah so like this one is custom and then let's just go to video card and this accepts a is custom right okay and then what happens is if it's custom so let's go here and let's just show um so where we would normally have the thumbnail right here we can say if it's custom then have some stuff otherwise have oh so like just have a a basically a thumbnail a url that's like that's like different your that's a we we just give it a give a url image ourselves yeah like in this case you could we could maybe have like a but we will implement some functionality here but it'll be something like this it'll be like upload um thumbnail something along this line so something along this line of like so you see like it will say something like this upload thumbnail or like we'll be like a big square button or whatever and then it'll say like we click it it would open a file picker okay oh we could actually just do it as simple as that it would open a file picker and then that would give you the arrow oh and that will give us the url to your local machine yeah so this would be a local image that you can use to test out the um the thing right oh yeah i mean that go ahead well i think we could actually have it so that it pops up a a model saying enter a url yeah and then we could just maybe go then you can basically put any url in so you know like what do you think oh like any other image let's actually do that that would be easier yeah that's basically where it's like if it's a model you give it a url let's do that i think that'll be easier for now yeah what do you think yeah i think so too i think that'd be a nice and that will actually work quite nicely here yeah okay so in that case what we could do is um so that so basically what now only is a model right just a model yeah right uh and then a click of that model basically and then that model will need to pass back the url the url from the text field exactly and or url field exactly and luckily material ui has really nice modules so pretty much go ahead and copy this model right here so this needs state and a bunch of things so like here what we can do is i've used this model before uh to get it up and running nicely what we can just do is we can copy this bit so we just have a model so let's go back to our code so let's go into our video card so let's make this a bit clean and let's just have a bunch of save save save says oh my god so many cards okay so here so now what we can do is under before we actually have let's get rid of this comment so we can say const modal equals boom and this would be our model so like in a jss jsx or fragment yeah right and then guys we need a piece of state which is going to keep track of you know like if it's open or not so in react we have um sort of the react way of writing variables is through sort of uh through state so this is how you use the use state hook so you see here we can actually auto import it and basically this is how you set up a variable in react in like the react way we can say that okay right so we're saying we're actually creating a variable called open this is the the sort of function we call whenever we want to change what open is right so if you want to take the value of it we call this function and then it basically changes the value of it but then it rerenders everything in react way right yeah yeah and the initial value of that variable is false so that way we're telling it's billion as well nice nice nice and then that gets assigned here so that so the model will be open if this is true and then here on close what we can do is we need to write a function so const on close and this is a function which is basically just going to essentially just say it's like when you close we basically just want to set set open to false but that's where also we will save the url as well but that's going to be for later yes save url logic will go here yeah yeah and then we don't need this stuff right now the body of this stuff so if we go and check out what they have so in their demo they actually had something like this so they actually had some like sort of styling and this that but i think i mean we could use their styling like but i mean in our case we did we just want i mean we just want an input field to kind of pop up in text field right so we just we still have to specify the body is but we just just put in that we have to put a text field in their body oh yeah let's just use a div in the text field yes i'm saying yeah exactly yeah so here we can just say a sort of uh text field so text filled and we used the text field and what other what file was it it was um video it wasn't was it in the uh no no we're in video card it was in there oh no the text was it was in the search the search one so header yeah so this one here so we can go ahead and import that here so import text field and let's go ahead and do it here so text field and if we go over here you can see handle close is not defined so handle close oh yeah oh yeah because you have yeah to the same yeah and now if we go oh and there's going to be nothing which actually opens the um the uh okay so i can access mode okay so we haven't even brought in the model yeah so here what we need to do is we need to go ahead and say import modal from something like this modal and this should fix i think that's how you import the model okay so i think now the computer's starting to slowly die yeah it's like come on i know it's like oh you can do it help out here that's why the command that's why the command key is trying to chip away you know i know right oh right we're not actually using the moto i don't think so open is so modal yeah you have to click well don't we have to set open on the click of a certain something we do but i mean like this should be like we basically just pop the model there and then it should cannot access modal before initialization but where are we accessing modal before initializing it here hold on all right so in the return block we have mode your import model yeah you are module okay of course yeah because i'm actually calling it modo here as well right oh yeah yeah sure let's actually just use the the thing over here rather than having that yeah i'll do that but there's only a few lines of code so here we can say module there we go nice and then handle closes that nice that should be all good now so yeah there we go so now we will have is we'll have it when we click upload thumbnail it will open up that model right mmhmm so i'm gonna do it so on click here what we can do is we can say e we can do an inline function we can just say set open to be true and now what we can do is if i go ahead and do upload thumbnail so you see it opens up in that corner a little text all right so i mean that's not ideal right now um oh yeah so how do you open the center so what we can do is they actually pass in a bunch of things they pass in um so their documentation says so let me go ahead and switch it to that so it says like a div so what we can do is just quickly go ahead and we'll copy in there sort of style roughly into our app so we have div and then that was exclusive and this actually means that so what they actually do here is you see like they've got this right here but then they've also got the sort of like modal style here so and the classes so we need these two things so right now i'm just going in and i'm basically going ahead and copying that inside here gotcha of course use styles and we need to do some imports and stuff like that and then what we're going to go ahead and do is basically i'm just going to go ahead and copy this pretty much block here so i mean we can refactor this but the point is that we're just kind of getting past this issue right now right now but when we did the full build we can pretty much go ahead and right now they're doing a random left and right you see that so we just want to be centered every time so we don't need the random because what they were doing is every time they clicked open modal that's so interesting it was popping in different spots to show like on the sort of demo how it can pop up yeah different areas but here what we can say is if we save it and we go back make styles is not defined because make styles is not defined on line 17 so it makes sense yeah that is true whereas make styles so we can import from a material ui core nice and now let's see just refresh and we can see come on come on hey now we have the little url okay cool so now we have okay so we have a search box and the only thing we probably need is like just a submit button or a submit button here that search text field but text field right exactly so at this point we have a text field but we can actually make this a bit more nicer we can actually just do a little form put the textbook inside of it like this have a button so a material ui button so i'm going to go ahead and pull in um or import material ui do this and we can say submit or we can say set image url yeah and then when we click that button we can actually so firstly if we set the type of this to submit then it will submit the form right oh really yeah so if you set the type of submit it means that you get that enter key behavior so you know when you're typing into the input field yeah yeah because it's all inside of a form you'll get that behavior by default so remember when we type into this field so when we type into the upload uh when that field pops up we actually need to keep track of what we're typing so a quick way of doing that is we need to keep a piece of state to keep track of what's inside there so here we can say input text yeah or in this case it's actually the image url i guess yeah and then set set image url exactly set image url so here what we can do is and then by default it's i mean you could set a placeholder i mean now we leave it as blank for now image url um and then what we can do is we can go ahead and say here that the value is the image url and the on change so every time you sort of type in something we're going to say set image url to be e every time we type inside that text field it's going to update the our state the image url state oh okay see yeah and then on the on here we need to do is on click we need to do handle close right because when you click that button handle close and then that's also where we basically do our sort of um i mean actually at this point we don't even need the we actually are saving yeah yeah we're actually doing it as we do it there so um okay so at this point what we can do is upload thumbnail so we can actually go ahead and click on upload thumbnail and you can see like here so now let's just say we were to grab so let's just say abc and we set image url so now in our state it would actually be abc and actually it would be i know okay so this is actually something interesting now so when we do this right yeah we don't actually i think what we should do at this point is we should set we should have a piece of state for the input yeah so set input reason being is because if you do it like that then it's actually going to dynamically change the background before you've even clicked submit the way we're going to do it yeah yeah so yeah instead of unchanged you would do on input or like on submit right yeah so we actually need another piece of state for the image so we have one for the input and one for the image the reason being it makes sense in a second but like if we do it like this um so the input would be one but do you even need oh no you're right you're uh well i mean can you can you just simply just pass in uh can you just simply pass in a value from the text field into a function you like the e target the value right so look so let's check this out look if you're inside here look right you target the value basically oh you don't have that because you only can you can only do on submit you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah gotcha so from my understanding just just like if i understand like if if we go back to videocard.js my understanding what's going to happen is this so the text field right here as you type it's going to save the input text right yeah but the actual image url is going to be saved only once you hit the button exactly right so once you hit once you hit the button hey submit then the new url is going to be set as as sunny is typing right now and then we're going to use the image url to finally show um on the front page exactly yeah yeah and then what we also need to do is because we're using a form here we need to actually say that it gets an event when you submit and you need to say e dot prevent default otherwise it refreshes the page and then react we hate refreshes yeah right so we have to do that so now with this said what it should do is it will actually set it'll set the image url and then it'll set open to false but we're not actually using the image url anywhere so remember here we actually said if it's custom then this right so here what we could do is we could say if it's custom and there is no image url then show that upload thumbnail or like so let's just say a select thumbnail just say select thumbnail right and then what would happen is it would show this in the beginning so image url is not defined so image or interesting imagery is not defined image url okay image url did you spell it wrong yeah yeah it looks like yeah so now we need to do that and we can see okay so now if we do select in sec thumbnail let me do this and then here if i go to um oh oh my god was i not sharing the screen the entire time no you're you're just sharing you're sharing the code oh you're fine oh yeah i'm good yeah yeah okay yeah you're fine yeah so now let's go ahead and find like a um a thumbnail so let's go ahead and type in thumbnail i know i've been in situations too where like i'm showing something like i zoom i'm like and they're like what are you showing us i'm like oh yeah and then yeah oh damn it i don't know where that was yeah or some dodgy picture comes up so there's the copy image your address so now what we can do hopefully is if we go here and i do this so we do okay so actually this may not work so if i do set image url so you see that okay so that's right that is right but what it actually did there is it so it did render it because the condition was no longer true so it rendered this one but the source here right so what we actually changed yeah we need to say first check if the image url exists otherwise do we need to check check yeah because the reason why is because what's happening now is that it it it's basically it's saying it was custom so it showed the button and there was no image so it showed that oh that makes sense yeah and afterwards render out the firstly check if there is an imager which would only be present if it was custom uh otherwise just show a thumbnail url god just makes sense here yeah yeah yeah so now let's go ahead and click select let's try it whenever we do this and we do paste and we do set image url hey look at that hey would you look at that nice nice nice ratio and stuff like that's messed up but i think what we can do here is we can actually set the height of the you know that the height of it correctly yeah we can do yeah usually usually like what i would do is like i would have like a background image like i would set the div like a creative with a specific height and then you have like a background image yeah um which is like which is like what which will fit the the div right but but you know i think yeah i know i know in my case in this case like what we could do honestly honestly honestly though sunny this doesn't matter because here's the thing when you when you're going to test out a thumbnail your thumbnail image you are going to have the exact same aspect ratio yeah so you just have to yeah you have to make sure because you're not going to upload an image that's a different aspect ratio there we go like that right exactly yeah yeah yeah and then i guess like even for like the test video i mean like this stuff we could we we we could include in the module i guess um in oh like uh the the actual like submit stuff is in the text yeah yeah i mean we could just do like a title if you want to do a title really quickly just another just another use state another use state and uh uh and a title yeah so so we'll do text field so we could do is we could do const and here we could say uh time and this one can i can i actually try this one yeah go actually try this one you do it okay so okay so so we have so we're going to create a title basically right yeah and now we're going to have it you're going to use use state so that we can save that title yeah you stay and by default we're going to basically just be nothing right well can we actually have a can we actually have a default be like a test title um so remember this one isn't going to be shown because we're only going to check we're only going to we we need some kind of what if what what if we do show it though oh we because we're just gonna change all of the ones remember we need something oh yeah yeah that's true that's true so it's just gonna be an empty string got it got it got that's true got it so i'm gonna save that that's fine then i'm going to go to the text field and i'm going to oh are you following me yep oh no i'm not okay um okay let's go yeah yeah text field i'm going to copy this text field now and then i'm just going to create another one right except in this one the value of this one is going to be actually i need to create another one which is going to be in a title input right yeah to be fair i mean for the title yeah but you're right yeah oh input yeah let's keep it consistent yeah set title input right right equals use state yeah we're also going to set that to nothing okay so save that let's go ahead and do that let's go back to textview we're going to say the title input for this one right so title input because we want to keep track of the title as you are typing and then we will do set title input right set title input beautiful okay so that's going to be that that's going to be that uh let's go just say this and see how this how this how this looks like so if we save that yep so and save that and then yeah and open it inside identify title oh okay remember our prop was actually called title oh okay okay okay so hold on so we're gonna we're gonna say um uh thumb thumb title like this we could do thumbtail yeah yeah set thumb title i know i know it sounds weird i know i know man we'll just keep us that we'll keep it in the title input okay and then title input there we go and that's fine all right so save that yeah you need to refactor your your um your variables the ones that are using so yeah so oh this is the same that one's good yeah so but in the handle close you need to actually use your thumb title right yeah yeah yeah but not yet i just want to see how it looks like for now okay yeah yeah so now what we can do is we can save that and then we go back and here see nice okay so this is actually so that we've got two things here but because it's in it's like defaulting it to a row you see that so we should add like a placeholder right yeah like a placeholder exactly yeah so let's do that right now so i'm going to say text field placeholder yeah for this one and this is just going to be like um image url like this right and the placeholder for this one is going to be title exactly all right so save that okay yep so save that let's go over here and now refresh let's go select thumbnail and we should hey nice all right sweet sweet sweet so we kind of got it it's not it's not fancy but it's fine but it works yeah okay so then on clothes on a close all we have to do guys is simply we do set set um set title set title right now set thumb set set thumb title right yeah title and we will and guys in the comments below which one would we use in terms of the input which one would you use well we would use this one because that's the one that is being changed by the actual input right as you as you type you're going to say title input right there right there boom and so now we actually have to use that in our jsx okay exactly so here's our title so what do we do in this case so we'll so we will say basically it's either basically but we can do a few things either we do it like this so we say um thumb title what do i say can i get a suggestions thumb title yeah or oh wait wait no or title like this right yep we just do like that you do that yeah because by default it would be uh it'll be commas right it'll be like blank uh yeah yeah yeah so if we go now to we now take a look at what's going on so let's try it again so it's like demo image this one let's just do yo set image hey there we go hey would you look at that nice oh dang that's it and that's nice and like wait that would basically be repeated for the rest of it so we would repeat that here we'd repeat that here we'd repeat that for this right yeah and then we'd essentially get like and that's actually pretty cool that's actually really handy like uh yeah and then like when we actually make a full youtube clone we can implement the functionality of this into the youtube clone right and so now you have a full youtube code that looks exactly like youtube yeah by not but you add the functionality of selecting a thumbnail to it voila that would be dope right really nice yeah that'd be super cool man and then that would mean that like we'd literally have the actual youtube clone with the thumbnail and now we've already figured out how to do the thumbnail stuff so yeah now like just to show you guys again because that's really cool that's really really nice like here like if we do this and then we say like let's just say like uh let's build oops yeah so in this case we'd style this bit but it'll say let's build an app and then we do this and you see that let's build an app nice nice okay nice and then in that case what we would end up having guys is literally a case of we would go ahead and build out the rest of this stuff so imagine like we would have the rest of this so you can actually see like look at the transition there like we're actually getting there like you see that we saw yeah it was pretty we're not far guys give us some fire for this like sir guys give us some fire in the comments below because look at this i mean it's pretty i mean okay i know it's not perfect yeah we still got some good styling to do but it's almost there exactly and guys the one thing i will say is that usually it's like it's very well put like preprepared but this was like completely from scratch so this was like a complete from scratch that we just was running through this and we were showing you like as we were comparing against youtube so a lot of the other sort of videos we have like sort of prepared things beforehand and we sort of run through code and this and that boys in this case it was a real demonstration of actually like running through it with us as we built something so it kind of gives you guys some reality as to how actually how real builds go when you actually do this stuff and you can see like in terms of actually similarities like it's very very it's getting there in terms of like obviously it's not bad at all imagine the sidebar was sort of uh pushed into it as well like you'd have quite a lot already here that's looking similar right yeah that's always like literally like literally we're not we're not far off i mean yeah i mean there's there's some styling you have to do and stuff like that but once we get that we're good man nice i said should we maybe take questions now what do you think knows yeah let's take some questions if you guys have any questions let us know if you got any questions you know development related uh you know life related and just nothing personal life related maybe well we'll see yeah i haven't uh let me get your uh instagram handle on us so that way like maybe we can we can just end it off with a nice little you know finisher yeah because let me get your insta up here so nice so guys yes shoot us your questions down below and we can pretty much answer anything that you guys want to ask yeah and if you guys get any ideas for what you guys want us to build next let us know in the comments below as well and like obviously we want to obviously we're here to build we're here to teach and we're here to build with you guys so you know just let us know we'll try to figure it out you know maybe you want to build a machine learning system who knows exactly yeah you guys might want to build that like i see a lot of people actually asking for like machine learning stuff so no literally sunny we should do it we should use tensorflow js honestly yeah like we we could do that yeah we should that'd be dope like and i think you can actually use uh tensorflow models uh with firebase yeah and then there's really cool thing actually maybe i can send you this video this guy and maybe you can probably maybe you can you can show this actually hold on where is this there's a really cool video showing tensorflow how you can crop a person out you can build a using javascript you can build you can build this cool thing yeah it will call a person now and put them in a different setting oh nice really yeah yeah hold on maybe i can show it to you for everybody to see as well while everybody's typing any questions it's just so cool man oh that's somebody just dropped slack clone oh that's i never thought of a slack clone yeah so steve mccarthy said a second that's a that's a really nice idea like didn't even look at that that would be and that would be really cool to build with firebase actually um so radam says i am late for the live session mayor come in [Laughter] yes okay don you may come in yeah that is hilarious yeah so as few people say it's huge use tensorflow so um guys in case you're wondering what tensorflow is while nars is finding his video so tensorflow is like a it's a here is a website it's an endtoend open source machine learning platform it's very popular and essentially like it's a way so machine learning works in a way basically you train models right you train models and basically what happens is you have some input that goes into the model like imagine like a box in the middle right that's the model that takes the input basically determines so i'm not going to go into how machine learning really works down to like a nearby level but like it basically take that input and it will give you some kind of output which you can use and in in some cases it'll be like is this a face or is this not a face right yeah is this is this sort of a person or is this not a person and those models the way you train them and the way it sort of works like platforms like tensorflow are sort of very reusable sort of uh sort of platforms to use and they're very good when it comes to sort of like a lot of production companies use things like tensorflow and um i think firebase use them as well yeah yeah a lot i think i can find it i think you can find it a lot of people think yes machine learning definitely that's not really learning yes so facebook clone somebody said we actually went ahead and built um not a facebook clone as such but we built a uh facebook messenger app so if you guys are interested in that definitely go check that out it's a realtime facebook messenger app which is really really nice um so so evil namekian says why why do you need css when you have a web design in web development so css is everything underneath what git what allows you to have some kind of design in web development um so yeah so you you need css is so web dev consists of three things html css javascript css is what makes it look pretty that's why it's why we got the app looking the way it looked um even though it wasn't the most previous we tried our best for the time we had exactly like in terms of like yeah guys like we built that from scratch from the getgo um yeah yeah and at the same point like when you're so this is one thing i do want to sort of stress like no do you find that like so a lot of people talk about flow state right like when you're sort of coding and you're going to flow i definitely go into a sort of flow state when i'm sort of coding i'm like if if i'm sort of like even when i'm pair programming or doing something you your speed like there's this tradeoffs guys because like pair programming like you're going to learn new things right you're going to learn things and shortcuts and things like that you didn't know but when you sort of code a lot and you get used to like sort of cutting yourself you can actually do a lot by yourself in some areas and like when you sort of tend to sort of like a lot of people would just chuck on some music and start coding then like you'll sort of get into a flow state and like you could actually sort of go crazy and like i actually built the netflix app really fast like i was shocked like the netflix app the sort of youtube clone i know youtube cloned them the instagram phone like you can go into those sort of like very focused states so but when we're sort of live streaming and we're talking and we're explaining it yeah it will take a longer time yeah yeah but guys yeah freaking sunny build an amazing netflix school so just i just want to say like give sonny a round of applause in the comments because he just killed it it's just so good and it looks good and literally you cannot even compare it like i mean you can barely tell the difference between like netflix clown you know and the real netflix so yeah but awesome what about that man this one right here netflix clown so this was a fun project dude like i remember like i literally just like cause he was like yo like maybe we should build netflix gun and i was like okay like and then i was like okay let me see if there's like a a movie api library and i just sort of like threw on some music and before you know it this thing oh man and you guys love him maybe we should just make him netflix competitor you know yeah exactly yeah maybe i should just do that by the way sonny i sent you a video stupid video of the tensorflow thing take a look at it and slack check it out so real time uh teleportation in so let me see if i can get this up it might not be the smoothest for everyone but let's go ahead and see like okay so you see that so like so look he's a so he's so checked out he's actually in his room right there right he's in his room the is cutting him out and putting him on a different phone look at that oh damn so he's so the the camera is actually in his room and it's just him dancing but it's putting him in a different location it will where he's just simply using his uh his phone that's insane so that guys can you see yeah like literally this is the video feed right it gets fed into like a tensorflow model like so and then they basically crop out this image and then it's rendering him or it's like projecting him onto a different camera right or something or like i went to reality yeah i went to the reality yeah damn that's insane guys who wants us to build that let us know in the comments below that would i think that would be cool man that would be cool yeah oh yeah let's do that freaking building august in reality yeah and this guy built it pretty pretty recently this was in april 20th oh damn yep yep yep awesome so we have a few yeah a lot of fun nice you guys are awesome can't wait to finish coding them all oh thank you very much yeah and guys if you enjoyed this like shoot an instagram story post it for us we love to have conversations with you guys yeah instagram tags are over here and nazis is over there it's always such a hard like i'm always pointing at my mic and i'm like it's that one right there there you go okay maybe you're right measures go like this yeah oh actually i think honestly that's the easiest way just to point to your mic you know what no i feel like i've got my stream deck in the perfect position if i point at it it just looks like it that's hilarious man so yeah guys tag us on your instagram you know let us know what else you want to see from us and you know we'll be happy to build some more stuff this is what we're here to do hola kunlei says you guys are amazing we appreciate you guys we love you guys and the support you guys give us um steve mccarthy says you'll spend you'll spend weeks training the model so you know like this is the thing guys like a lot of tensorflow and like and even firebase actually they have models that you can go and just use right they have more years which have been pretrained on like on god knows how much they are um they're probably constantly improving as well because models do require huge amounts of data um and then yeah like it you can pretty much use stuff on tensorflow you use stuff on firebase and they save you that hassle so yeah so sunny some somebody asked a question here do you play chess oh okay this one's on first so evil namekian says do you play i do play chess probably not do you play chess wait what wait you play chess i mean i i'm not a professional i mean i wouldn't say i'm pro i can serve a rubik's cube okay oh okay all right all right [Laughter] have you ever played quasi uh i haven't no i'd like to play cozy oh man you have to play cozy man yeah he's uh he competed didn't he he played like this this guy is a beast of chess i mean i mean i mean that's what he does it's like it just i just literally come in like it was one time one time just a funny story quick little story yeah one time i was going live i was going live this was during the challenge like the javascript challenge yeah and i was like i was like 20 minutes from going live and kaiser sends me hey bro let's just play some chess you know to play chess i'm like bro i'm in 20 minutes i'm going live what the what the hell are you talking about you know he's like yeah let's just play some chess so we end up playing some chess i remember i think i jumped on i was like yo guys were you guys doing it i think i was like i just saw a chessboard and you had nars i was like what the hell is happening yeah yeah so that was really funny troy mitchell dropped a nice comment he says you guys blew the doors off all learning platforms great jobs love that thank you troy are you are you in profit javascript by the way oh yeah troy yeah oh we should mention have we mentioned that at all here no i don't think we have yeah i haven't mentioned it but guys if you find if you find any of the live streams uh useful or like literally like any of the content that we talk about useful like for example troy in this case like then definitely is worth going and checking out the course that we offer so you you're pretty much going to get the following so let's go ahead and show them what profit javascript's all about yeah guys it's beginner friendly so you guys don't need any experience if you've never coded before it's completely fine um nero i think yeah nero is actually inside the course herself so yeah nars and some amazing coaches in pwj lucky to learn from them thank you very much guys and like we have 15 like javascript modules which take you completely from beginner to a very sort of like a comfortable level at the point which you can pretty much go from landing your first clients and jobs um talk about the sort of the the additional stuff we offer yeah i mean guys i mean but i mean guys it's pretty simple guys you know this is not something here that you're going to be simply just watching videos right you've got the support of you know a community of 1500 members so for example we have a slack community with 1500 members where all the students kind of come in right at this point it's 15. it's not 13.52 it's basically it's 1500 students guys really 1500 students seriously everybody's in there everybody's helping each other out right answering questions anything on top of that what do you got you got a weekly coaching course but you know sunny amazing sunny and nas like me right like and us right and we basically we teach you guys every single week we teach you you know the bare bones of of of coding we teach you how to how to do interviews we teach you how to go ahead and actually do your resume we teach you you know all the skills that's related to coin that you need to know to go out there into the job market you know get clients and actually get your first job as a developer right so if that's something you're interested in what if you're actually interested in being coached by people who've been in your you know who've been developers for a lot of years now right and know what to teach you then you gotta join there's not even a question guys exactly right we're there we have an exclusive uh slack community guys and guys just to like show you how proactive the community so logan actually just jumped into the comments right now logan's on the course guys and he goes i personally answered three questions in there in the last 24 hours it's like honestly like it's so on fire like it's like literally like if you guys ask a question in stack overflow how many of you guys have run into that problem where you're like ah nobody's asking or like you just feel terrified to ask in case they make you feel like a dumb ass like that's the truth and we also have some amazing stuff so troy mitchell says i'm not part of the course yet it sounds like i should 100 percent dude not even a question troy troy if you ever want to become a developer in any of your thought if you find you know the possibilities out that opportunities out there with developer amazing the ability for you to work remotely like to work remotely i mean guys we're working from anywhere pretty much right you know freelancers or anything like that you can work from anywhere and so if that is something that interests you guys we literally have you know the link it's actually it was just dropped in the comments or we also have a link in the description right there yeah link just down below literally link in the description guys leave the description check it out guys you will not be disappointed guys exactly no we would not yeah go ahead i was just gonna say troy like if you jump in literally like what is love about like pwj and so proper javascript is that like we it's not just like this sort of community where like in most udemy courses out there right they're very much in case of like you'll you'll get the course but say you wanted to contact the person teaching the course it's just impossible like you're not going to ever get through to that person right as soon as you join if you want to jump on a call with me if you don't jump on a call with nars or anything you literally just send a slack message and we'll hop on a call like it's very simple exactly we're always jumping on com like calls with whether somebody's got an interview they need help preparing with uh whenever somebody's got a client and they don't know how to handle a situation it's so one to one it's ridiculous like we also have um evil namekian says profitable javascript helps computer science students too so does it yes yeah i mean i mean i was a computer science student guys right of course if you could be a science student what's what's your goal like evil evil i feel i'm gonna say i'm gonna say evil if your goal is to become a developer right you know the main thing the main thing that would you that you will probably don't have you probably don't have in college right now is you probably and you know let me know if you're if i'm writing this is you probably don't have the actual real world experience that you need you're probably learning a lot of theory you're probably you know learning a lot from a lot of theater from all your professors right but you're not actually building projects you're not actually doing a lot of real world yeah so what we do is if we flip it around in that course we flip it around to a point where all your dual not all but most of what you're doing is real world you're building projects every single module well building projects from scratch where we are teaching you how to do something from the beginning from just an idea and how to build it out to a reality exactly because that is something that a lot of students don't know what to do because they're confused about that and that is what we do with every single project from exactly idea to reality exactly and guys and you will not have better energy like nasa's coaching course are just now how do your coaching goals end every time like the energy every time guys the coaching calls and with a dance party exactly it's insane i've never even my coaching course like everyone's like yo can we have a dance session i'm like oh my god i don't know how noise gets this energy but like that's the kind of energy that is in pwj guys like that kind of like you know love and and sort of like growth with the community like steve mccarty says sunny i'll join your slack to help out answering questions as a cto for a med tech company in 35 years and steve actually is always on the live course so uh yeah we could we could probably bring him in yeah definitely that we'll be yeah yeah we'll talk we'll talk with kazi yeah we'll talk with kazi yeah that'd be awesome cool uh we've got near okay says success coaches are preparing content for beginners you have an amazing community to help you out they make you feel like don't worry we got you that's something i love i love that comment yeah thank you nero yeah it's really really nice um yeah so we have a few some of the guys how do you handle seo issues on computer science troy troy i see you in the comments i want to see you in pwj come on let's go let's do it what are you waiting for troy i see you exactly i see you jump in dude jump in i'm currently in that say like yeah so troy that's actually a really interesting so he's currently a net developer at work and now yeah so troy did you know that react is the most number one most wanted uh library or like literally language right now like i was in like in terms of javascript like and yeah in comparison to like java and all of those things and python everything literally reacted sitting at the top on stack overflow yeah like because then like so net was huge before but remember like all programming is also it's constantly evolving it's constantly changing right now reacts on fire um javascript skills like literally you've got angular you've got react you've got view you've got all of these different things like i don't know who knows what it's going to be in two years but like all i know is that javascript is literally on it's fire right now it's on fire and it's definitely something which i think troy troy should be in this course dude like i don't know what are you waiting for honestly i don't know what are you what are you still doing i don't know what are you still waiting for honestly yeah it's really like and to be honest like dude like you get a 30 30 day money back guarantee so yeah give it a try risk free for that you're joined right now you me me sonny and you we all getting a call how about that how about that you join right now you're doing right now we'll get a slack call yeah link in the description bro and literally we'll jump on a call right now and we can have a chat that would be awesome yeah yeah nice choice like i try other red courses but you your teaching methods are really making a click yeah there we go sonny's killing it logan says i am a computer science grad and the projects inside the course are worth their weight in gold it's it's all the employers want to see that's amazing yeah there you go so so that was one that was by the way but that was by the way the goal of this this course this is when we when we first built this the goal was like what do the employers want to see like what type of projects do the employers want to see when they actually go to them right because as long as you just build some you know some some stuff that you don't even want to show like you're not proud to show but you want to build things that you're proud to show and you're like yo check my project out and they're gonna be like whoa that looks good exactly yeah 100 dude like is it everyone in the course like they have these like the sickest like the best sort of like portfolios they have everything sort of ready like if you go through the course and you literally do put in the work and you attend the coaching course literally like i think we have like four coaching calls every week now consistently yeah as well as we're dropping daily lives like we're doing so much on this on like i there's nothing like this at the moment in the programming community i don't think like i don't think so either and then the difference between us and any other course out there is that we don't just teach you how to code we teach you how to actually go ahead and make a killing with it like how to make some money from your coding like yeah whether you're a weekend so like i always sort of teach you in the coaching call like if you're a weekend you're at that point where you're you can teach somebody who's never coded a day in their life like you're a week ahead of them so you can start coaching you can start doing things there's always a way and we we go through all of that in the course yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh man nero says niro says do what you love and live what you do i love that that is that is a good motto yeah and she goes we get the work done and then we die of course we get to work on the first we do is we get the work done and then we just relax exactly yeah hassan goes it's past 3 30 and not a wink of sleep with these two online hey i love it i think hassan is also in the course actually yeah i think so yeah yeah yeah nice yeah amazing and it's so cool that's so cool that you just know people at this point like it's so cool like everybody who comes in the course you just know like niro hassan you know you know for example you know amanda comes in right you just know people at this point like yeah like it's that's and guys like that says something with 1500 students inside the course and we know exactly who's here inside that course like it's this is such a wicked community like it really does like yeah it really is like something that's just never been seen like and guys that we have so much coming like there's just like no there's so much craziness coming like if you guys are excited and you enjoyed all of this like smash the thumbs up because it just helps us out it helps grow the channel like it helps more people find this and sort of see it and like if it helped you out it can help them out um yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like oh my god man this is yeah i just oh i just since you told me you're coming to l.a i just can't wait to see you in l.a man yeah dude i'll be there soon man i said uh probably early september i'm gonna try and get out there that that's what i'll be there i'll be there early september may potentially earlier yeah yeah that'd be awesome you know oh man wait for how long you think you're coming for it like i'm curious or do you not know so probably like a week a week and a half maybe two weeks max yeah like at a time yeah man that would be good oh oh this stuff will create crazy right so fun man literally all of us in one place will be oh some crazy i don't know how that's gonna work out that that's gonna be like this can be just fire all the time yeah just imagine do i just imagine us loving fire emojis it's gonna be fire just like fire fire fire fire fire fire the whole the blood is gonna be on fire [Laughter] exactly should we wrap this up let's do it bro right so i hope you guys enjoyed that if you did smash the like button and share it with your friends and and there's any sort of anything last you want to add there that's it guys thank you guys so much for watching it was very awesome for me to to kind of join thank you for letting me join just kind of on the whim that was fun that was so so it literally changed the whole livestream yeah thanks so much and have a great day everybody all right and then the name and in the words of nas we will see you in the next one peace guys exactly peace out
