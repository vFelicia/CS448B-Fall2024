00:00 - what's up youtube firebase version nine
00:04 - things you must know okay because if you
00:06 - don't know them you're gonna be in
00:07 - trouble you're probably thinking hey
00:09 - what's up with the stash cause why am i
00:12 - learning today from ron jeremy well
00:13 - that's not what i'm here to answer all
00:15 - right what i'm here to answer is how can
00:17 - i help you become a really awesome
00:20 - developer okay so a couple of things
00:22 - that i want to talk to you about okay so
00:25 - welcome welcome everybody who's live if
00:26 - you're not live i love you anyway smash
00:28 - that like button let's freaking get
00:29 - right into it okay so hopefully my face
00:33 - is gonna be in
00:35 - there we go okay now we got some action
00:37 - going on so i want to just give you a
00:39 - micro lesson it's not prepared this is
00:41 - completely live and we're just to play
00:43 - you know and go off the seat of our
00:45 - pants here so a couple of things i want
00:47 - to share with you right so if you were
00:49 - using react before i want to show you
00:51 - what's the difference between
00:53 - version 8 and version 9 of firebase so
00:56 - how you've been using firebase your
00:58 - whole life things have just changed
01:00 - permanently and
01:02 - you better start using this new way
01:04 - because it's going to make your app so
01:05 - much freaking better all right so if
01:07 - there's any time to learn it that time
01:09 - is now and that's what i'm here to share
01:11 - with you now there are a lot of nerdy
01:13 - reasons for why you should use firebase
01:15 - version nine like there's uh it's tree
01:17 - shakeable and your code is gonna be
01:19 - smaller and faster i wanna just show you
01:21 - all the stuff you need to know so here
01:23 - we go
01:24 - so remember we used to have our uh
01:26 - config files right so let's go to our
01:28 - config files and our config files you're
01:31 - used to seeing something like this right
01:33 - boom you have a firebase config now you
01:36 - can have initialize app at the top like
01:37 - this but this is the new way of doing it
01:39 - right before if you've ever seen our
01:41 - tutorials you might have seen us doing
01:44 - import firebase from firebase right and
01:47 - then we just export that export firebase
01:51 - um export default firebase
01:54 - right and then you would see us using
01:56 - that in firebase thing around everywhere
01:59 - in all of our other files right like for
02:01 - example we'd import it here and we'll be
02:03 - like cos db is equal to
02:04 - firebase.firestore
02:06 - right and we'd be using that thing
02:08 - everywhere we'd be using it for auth
02:10 - this is me showing you what it used to
02:12 - look like version eight okay it's me
02:14 - showing you version eight right now
02:17 - and you would import it right you would
02:19 - import it you would go import blah blah
02:21 - blah from firebase right and you would
02:23 - just keep calling it like this and that
02:25 - used to be like the way to do things and
02:27 - that was normal right and if you wanted
02:30 - to make a query you would do like
02:31 - db.collection
02:33 - get me all the games
02:35 - dot doc if you wanted to get a specific
02:37 - game or you would do something like
02:39 - where
02:40 - right or if you wanted to add a
02:42 - collection to the games you would do dot
02:44 - add or you would do dot update or dot
02:46 - set
02:47 - well this used to be the old way
02:50 - all right so this is the old way the new
02:53 - way we don't do that anymore
02:56 - all right that's the old way that way
02:59 - now unless you're using the old firebase
03:01 - you won't be able to do that way we want
03:03 - to move over to the new way okay so i
03:05 - want to show you what the new way looks
03:06 - like so it's pretty simple okay i'm just
03:08 - going to give you a fast run down here
03:11 - so in the new way what you want to do is
03:13 - instead of doing all of that what we
03:14 - want to do is
03:16 - we want to import okay and you can just
03:19 - get the specific things you're looking
03:21 - for so what we can actually do is we can
03:24 - just say hey get firestore
03:27 - from
03:28 - and now you can save from firebase
03:31 - firestore okay and i believe if you want
03:33 - to reduce your file size by like 80 and
03:36 - you don't need to use the on snapshot
03:37 - listener you know the on snapshot
03:39 - listener that makes your app live the
03:41 - whole time if you don't need that then i
03:44 - believe
03:45 - don't quote me on this look this up but
03:46 - i think you should be able to do
03:48 - something like slash light
03:50 - right and then that should give you a
03:52 - much more reduced file size okay i'm
03:55 - just gonna look that up just so i don't
03:57 - i don't screw you uh with you guys and
03:59 - give you some wrong information but
04:00 - let's just take a look at this import
04:03 - yes firebase firestore lite right and
04:06 - now reduce it but for those of you who
04:08 - need real-time apps like you're trying
04:10 - to build a real-time chat application or
04:12 - you're trying to build a real-time chess
04:13 - application which i'm working on right
04:15 - now then you don't want to use light all
04:18 - right you want to just do it like this
04:21 - but the so the nice thing about this new
04:23 - way of doing it is everything is a
04:25 - function the bad thing about it the new
04:28 - way is this tons of imports and exports
04:30 - now so for example if you want to be
04:32 - able to get a collection well you're
04:34 - going to have to import a collection at
04:36 - some point if you want to be able to um
04:38 - call your docs well you need to import
04:40 - get docs if you want to be able to read
04:42 - one specific doc you need to get doc if
04:45 - you want to be able to add a doc
04:47 - you need to get ad doc or set a doc
04:50 - set doc or update a doc you need to
04:52 - import update doc
04:55 - all right so your imports now look much
04:58 - bigger but again the benefit is the
05:00 - performance of your app is better
05:01 - because you're not using anything that
05:03 - you don't need now let me show you down
05:04 - here how your code will actually look
05:06 - right so if i go back to my app.js
05:09 - instead of using this object-oriented
05:11 - way of doing things what you will now
05:14 - instead do is you'll be able to do
05:16 - things like you'll be able to say set
05:18 - doc
05:19 - okay
05:20 - you'll be able to do set dock
05:23 - and you'll be able to call whatever
05:25 - ref you have right so for example i can
05:27 - actually say gamesref and i can say
05:29 - db.uh collection
05:32 - okay or what i can actually do is i can
05:34 - actually call the function collection
05:37 - right and
05:39 - now i can pass information
05:41 - over to that specific function so what
05:44 - does that look like well here's what it
05:46 - actually looks like right so let me show
05:47 - you
05:50 - so now i can take i can pass or i can
05:52 - even get like a specific doc okay so if
05:55 - i want to get a specific doc i pass it a
05:57 - database i pass it the collections i
05:59 - want to get it from and then i pass it
06:02 - the id
06:03 - of that specific document so let's just
06:05 - say id one two three okay
06:09 - this will get me now the specific
06:12 - uh the specific reference to one game
06:15 - that i want
06:16 - okay that's the new way of doing it now
06:20 - if i want to be able to get more
06:22 - information out of this right i can
06:24 - actually do game snap
06:26 - is equal to
06:28 - whatever game ref was right so let me
06:31 - actually show you here game snap
06:37 - okay and what i can do now is i can say
06:40 - await
06:41 - and i can say get doc and i can give it
06:43 - the game ref like this
06:46 - okay
06:47 - so this get dock the only again like i
06:49 - said the tricky thing is you could you
06:51 - want to import this get dock
06:54 - from your
06:55 - uh firebase
06:57 - okay that's the only thing that you want
06:59 - to do so what does that import look like
07:01 - it'll just look like this you'll import
07:03 - and you'll say get doc
07:05 - from your firebase file that you created
07:08 - okay just like that
07:10 - and now this will get you the specific
07:12 - doc now if you want to get the data
07:14 - that's really really simple at this
07:16 - point right so for example let's go here
07:18 - if i want to get the data i can actually
07:20 - just do this right game
07:22 - is gamesnap.data and this will return to
07:25 - me
07:26 - actually an array okay this will
07:29 - actually give me back something that is
07:32 - usable that i can actually do things
07:34 - with all right let me see if you guys
07:36 - got comments coming in
07:39 - uh
07:40 - yes sir kazi with that new look that's
07:42 - right
07:44 - welcome yeah nice nice having you guys
07:46 - on here by the way on the live
07:48 - so
07:49 - just remember everything now is a
07:52 - function so whatever things you want to
07:54 - do they are a function i want to show
07:56 - you another function that's also useful
07:58 - for you like if what if you want to
08:00 - update a document right so what you want
08:02 - to do for that is you want to do set
08:03 - dock you want to give it the reference
08:05 - of the game that you want to pass it
08:08 - okay then you can update your fields in
08:09 - the game so it's like game field
08:12 - one
08:14 - value one whatever right this is what
08:16 - you're just passing it and now you can
08:18 - pass whether you want merge to be true
08:21 - or false
08:22 - and
08:23 - this is how you would actually run that
08:25 - query
08:27 - okay and the last one i want to show you
08:29 - which is also really important is a lot
08:32 - of you guys want to use on snapshot
08:34 - listener so how you actually use the on
08:35 - snapshot listener with this is like this
08:37 - you'll call on snapshot
08:39 - then on snapshot now it's just a
08:41 - function you guys it's not like object
08:43 - oriented programming
08:45 - period period period you know none of
08:47 - that like chaining all the dots together
08:50 - it's not like that anymore on snapshot
08:52 - is just if uh it's just a function now
08:54 - okay so on snapshot might take a
08:56 - document or a collection for example
08:58 - that you want did you want to listen to
09:01 - and then it'll take a callback function
09:03 - all right so on snapshot is just that so
09:06 - how do we give it like a specific
09:08 - document right i can just do this i can
09:10 - do doc
09:12 - db
09:13 - right and then give like my id of one
09:16 - two three so this will give my on
09:19 - snapshot like a specific document to
09:21 - listen to right i can also just pass it
09:23 - that game ref that should be equivalent
09:26 - there's this game ref right here and
09:28 - then the callback function is like what
09:30 - do you now want to do with this
09:31 - information right so for example now
09:34 - what i can do
09:35 - is now i can actually call other things
09:38 - so i can do things like
09:40 - um this is a code this is some of the
09:42 - code that i already have written
09:44 - but um i'll try to like simplify it for
09:47 - you guys here
09:48 - right so now i'm getting the doc
09:51 - right and then i'm just reading from
09:53 - that
09:54 - from that doc that's it doc.data.data
09:56 - so this is how your new on snapshot
09:59 - listener would actually look
10:01 - we got people saying this is nice we got
10:04 - finn techery saying wow a lot of changes
10:06 - tree shaking uh yeah so the tree shaking
10:09 - is a real thing it makes your app a lot
10:11 - faster right i think
10:14 - god damn runs fast
10:16 - and this is a much more functional
10:18 - programming approach in the start if
10:21 - you've been using firebase the old way
10:23 - it will feel slightly weird but in the
10:25 - long run
10:26 - i feel i feel honestly more at home with
10:29 - this kind of already because those long
10:32 - weird chains they were always annoying
10:34 - to look at right like
10:36 - db.collections.where.something.something.then
10:41 - snapshot.com
10:42 - this looks a lot more normal readable
10:46 - also i like that on snapshot is just a
10:48 - function right yet doc is just a
10:51 - function
10:52 - um all of these are like functions but
10:55 - just one thing right is like now you
10:56 - have you do have to do set dock right
10:59 - and every function that i'm using here
11:00 - on snapshot right and if i go back to my
11:03 - firebase i now have to export all of
11:06 - these so that's something you do have to
11:08 - remember so like i have to do export i'm
11:11 - not going to do firebase but like set
11:12 - dock export update dock export
11:16 - collection
11:17 - get firestore add dock
11:19 - so
11:20 - a bunch of imports bunch of named
11:23 - exports
11:24 - then bunch of name imports in the files
11:26 - that you want to use it so yes i get
11:28 - that that is a little bit annoying but
11:31 - um
11:33 - but yeah like something you kind of got
11:35 - to get used to because i want you guys
11:36 - to be able to move on and start using
11:38 - version 9 of the firebase and not be
11:40 - stuck using version
11:42 - uh eight or seven because at some point
11:45 - it's gonna start to get deprecated
11:46 - you're gonna need to move on anyway and
11:48 - you're gonna regret that you didn't
11:49 - learn it now
11:51 - um you know or back then and you'll have
11:54 - to learn it at a much later point
11:56 - so i'd rather you have a competitive
11:59 - edge i'd rather you be ahead of the
12:02 - field and even if it seems a little
12:04 - intimidating or a little confusing right
12:06 - now
12:06 - i wanted to show this to you so that you
12:08 - could get ahead that you could actually
12:10 - get a head start and you could be ahead
12:12 - of where maybe some of your peers are so
12:14 - hopefully i thought you i hope you
12:16 - thought this was entertaining valuable
12:18 - tiny micro lesson decided to just do it
12:20 - live
12:21 - and uh just let me know did you enjoy
12:24 - this did you not enjoy this
12:26 - in either case hopefully you smash that
12:28 - like button
12:29 - and uh subscribe to the channel i love
12:31 - your beautiful face this is ron jeremy i
12:33 - mean rafikaze i'll see you in the next
12:36 - video

Cleaned transcript:

what's up youtube firebase version nine things you must know okay because if you don't know them you're gonna be in trouble you're probably thinking hey what's up with the stash cause why am i learning today from ron jeremy well that's not what i'm here to answer all right what i'm here to answer is how can i help you become a really awesome developer okay so a couple of things that i want to talk to you about okay so welcome welcome everybody who's live if you're not live i love you anyway smash that like button let's freaking get right into it okay so hopefully my face is gonna be in there we go okay now we got some action going on so i want to just give you a micro lesson it's not prepared this is completely live and we're just to play you know and go off the seat of our pants here so a couple of things i want to share with you right so if you were using react before i want to show you what's the difference between version 8 and version 9 of firebase so how you've been using firebase your whole life things have just changed permanently and you better start using this new way because it's going to make your app so much freaking better all right so if there's any time to learn it that time is now and that's what i'm here to share with you now there are a lot of nerdy reasons for why you should use firebase version nine like there's uh it's tree shakeable and your code is gonna be smaller and faster i wanna just show you all the stuff you need to know so here we go so remember we used to have our uh config files right so let's go to our config files and our config files you're used to seeing something like this right boom you have a firebase config now you can have initialize app at the top like this but this is the new way of doing it right before if you've ever seen our tutorials you might have seen us doing import firebase from firebase right and then we just export that export firebase um export default firebase right and then you would see us using that in firebase thing around everywhere in all of our other files right like for example we'd import it here and we'll be like cos db is equal to firebase.firestore right and we'd be using that

import it you would go import blah blah blah from firebase right and you would just keep calling it like this and that used to be like the way to do things and that was normal right and if you wanted to make a query you would do like db.collection get me all the games dot doc if you wanted to get a specific game or you would do something like where right or if you wanted to add a collection to the games you would do dot add or you would do dot update or dot set well this used to be the old way all right so this is the old way the new way we don't do that anymore all right that's the old way that way now unless you're using the old firebase you won't be able to do that way we want to move over to the new way okay so i want to show you what the new way looks like so it's pretty simple okay i'm just going to give you a fast run down here so in the new way what you want to do is instead of doing all of that what we want to do is we want to import okay and you can just get the specific things you're looking for so what we can actually do is we can just say hey get firestore from and now you can save from firebase firestore okay and i believe if you want to reduce your file size by like 80 and you don't need to use the on snapshot listener you know the on snapshot listener that makes your app live the whole time if you don't need that then i believe don't quote me on this look this up but i think you should be able to do something like slash light right and then that should give you a much more reduced file size okay i'm just gonna look that up just so i don't i don't screw you uh with you guys and give you some wrong information but let's just take a look at this import yes firebase firestore lite right and now reduce it but for those of you who need realtime apps like you're trying to build a realtime chat application or you're trying to build a realtime chess application which i'm working on right now then you don't want to use light all right you want to just do it like this but the so the nice thing about this new way of doing it is everything is a function the bad thing about it the new way is this tons of imports and exports now so for example if you want to be able to get a collection well you're going to have to import a collection at some point if you want to be able to um call your docs well you need to import get docs if you want to be able to read one specific doc you need to get doc if you want to be able to add a doc you need to get ad doc or set a doc set doc or update a doc you need to import update doc all right so your imports now look much bigger but again the benefit is the performance of your app is better because you're not using anything that you don't need now let me show you down here how your code will actually look

now you have you do have to do set dock right and every function that i'm using here on snapshot right and if i go back to my firebase i now have to export all of these so that's something you do have to remember so like i have to do export i'm not going to do firebase but like set dock export update dock export collection get firestore add dock so a bunch of imports bunch of named exports then bunch of name imports in the files that you want to use it so yes i get that that is a little bit annoying but um but yeah like something you kind of got to get used to because i want you guys to be able to move on and start using version 9 of the firebase and not be stuck using version uh eight or seven because at some point it's gonna start to get deprecated you're gonna need to move on anyway and you're gonna regret that you didn't learn it now um you know or back then and you'll have to learn it at a much later point so i'd rather you have a competitive edge i'd rather you be ahead of the field and even if it seems a little intimidating or a little confusing right now i wanted to show this to you so that you could get ahead that you could actually get a head start and you could be ahead of where maybe some of your peers are so hopefully i thought you i hope you thought this was entertaining valuable tiny micro lesson decided to just do it live and uh just let me know did you enjoy this did you not enjoy this in either case hopefully you smash that like button and uh subscribe to the channel i love your beautiful face this is ron jeremy i mean rafikaze i'll see you in the next video
