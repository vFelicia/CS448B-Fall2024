02:32 - about the new you just bad
02:35 - is so old it's not interesting no shush

02:43 - this is a language that all the other
02:45 - languages stem from
02:46 - if you know c plus you will pretty much

02:52 - now on top of that some of the top
02:54 - companies
02:55 - uber google amazon facebook they all
02:59 - use c plus plus gaming companies like ea
03:02 - nintendo
03:02 - sony blizzard are all using c plus plus
03:05 - for their gaming engine
03:07 - to build games so if you want to build
03:09 - games like star wars we're talking
03:10 - assassin's creed
03:11 - anything else related to games you need
03:14 - to know c plus plus if you're for
03:15 - example actually machine learning
03:16 - tesla's auto pilot system is actually
03:18 - built on c plus plus
03:20 - like what how crazy is that
03:23 - and according to indeed.com and the
03:26 - average c plus plus developer
03:28 - still makes a hundred and four thousand
03:30 - dollars this is a program language that
03:31 - is not
03:32 - going away anytime soon and is still
03:34 - going to be a very
03:35 - pinnacle of software development number
03:38 - four
03:39 - c sharp now it is a very useful laker
03:42 - that is easy to learn
03:43 - and it was built to compete with java
03:46 - and
03:46 - right now it is having a crazy comeback
03:50 - here's why right now windows
03:52 - applications
03:53 - like microsoft office microsoft excel
03:56 - we're talking photoshop
03:57 - we're talking internet explorer
04:00 - scratch that one though now on top of
04:02 - this right now
04:04 - vr development which is going really
04:06 - high
04:07 - is actually using t-sharp so if you are
04:10 - interested in building games
04:12 - with c-sharp okay this is the place
04:15 - to go over a few years coming it's going
04:18 - to skyrocket like crazy
04:20 - believe me there's an amazing community
04:22 - with c-sharp developers
04:24 - and you will not be left out another fun
04:28 - fact about c-sharp
04:29 - is it's actually used for building
04:33 - virtual reality games
04:35 - right we're talking oculus we're talking
04:37 - google the google virtual reality
04:39 - glasses i think right whatever it's
04:41 - called
04:42 - so as it's going up in ranks as more
04:45 - people use
04:46 - virtual reality c is going to be even
04:48 - more popular and more
04:49 - demanded now according to indeed.com c
04:52 - developers right now make
04:54 - over 98 000 on average
04:57 - but i really think it's gonna increase
04:59 - throughout the time
05:00 - with the whole virtual reality aspect
05:02 - number three
05:03 - java now java is a very popular language
05:07 - to learn
05:07 - so when you're talking about building
05:08 - android applications that is what it's
05:10 - used for
05:11 - also very much known in the enterprise
05:13 - software and actually
05:14 - listen this 97 of
05:17 - enterprise applications use java for
05:20 - developing
05:21 - large-scale software that means that if
05:24 - you want to work at companies
05:26 - like google like microsoft like
05:29 - uber they all use java for their large
05:32 - applications
05:33 - web applications enterprise software
05:35 - that
05:36 - is what they use now according to
05:38 - indeed.com
05:40 - java developers on average make a
05:42 - hundred and nineteen
05:44 - thousand dollars and in terms of demand
05:46 - at the time of
05:47 - filming there are over 33 000 jobs so
05:50 - the demand is there the necessity is
05:52 - there
05:53 - and based on that it is one of the most
05:55 - demanded programming languages
05:57 - out there now if we do take a look at
05:59 - google trends we can see that
06:01 - this programming language is declining
06:03 - just a little bit
06:04 - because all languages like kotlin which
06:07 - are trying to replace it
06:08 - but i personally think it's going to
06:10 - take a long time
06:12 - for these languages to replace something
06:14 - as big as java that is used by
06:16 - so many diverse applications i
06:18 - personally
06:19 - learned it when i was a beginner as well
06:21 - and so you should learn it
06:23 - too number two
06:26 - python oh you guys are gonna hate me for
06:30 - this
06:30 - aren't you what but python's number one
06:34 - no python is number one python is number
06:37 - one
06:44 - all right look python is a simple
06:46 - programming language
06:48 - it is one of the easiest ones to learn
06:50 - as personally
06:51 - don't worry still one of my favorites
06:54 - okay
06:55 - now this language is actually used by
06:57 - some of the biggest companies in the
06:58 - world we're talking google facebook
07:00 - to build back-end applications so for
07:03 - example
07:04 - when you're thinking of like of you
07:06 - clicking like on an instagram post right
07:08 - well check this out all the logic that
07:10 - happens and how you click on it how that
07:13 - data is saved
07:14 - later on that is happening through
07:16 - python
07:17 - with the help of a framework like django
07:20 - instagram
07:21 - yes instagram actually uses python
07:24 - for the whole backend application so if
07:27 - you're interested in
07:28 - building backend applications for
07:30 - companies like instagram
07:31 - and so forth this is going to be the
07:32 - place to do it on top of that
07:35 - it is probably one of the most the
07:36 - number one language that is used for
07:37 - machine learning
07:38 - so you're talking siri the voice
07:40 - assistant for machine
07:42 - me it was joining a learning which makes
07:45 - sense it loves to jam
07:47 - it does its best right self-driving cars
07:49 - machine learning and self-driving cars
07:51 - that is built on python and even like
07:53 - face detection right
07:55 - right the face id that is using python
07:59 - as well
07:59 - so listen python it is one of the top
08:02 - programming languages
08:03 - it is not going to go away anytime soon
08:06 - personally
08:06 - one of my favorite ones according to
08:08 - indeed.com on
08:09 - average python developers actually make
08:13 - 117
08:14 - 000 so if you're someone who is
08:17 - interested in building machine learning
08:18 - applications
08:19 - and building back-end applications but
08:21 - this is going to be the programming
08:22 - language for you
08:23 - on top of that it's probably one of the
08:25 - most easiest ones to learn
08:26 - also it's one of the most demanding ones
08:28 - with over 68
08:30 - 000 jobs according to stackoverflow
08:33 - survey
08:34 - python is one of the top languages out
08:37 - there too
08:37 - google trends is showing the fact that
08:40 - python is on the actual
08:42 - upscale and because of the amazing
08:45 - community for python
08:47 - because of the amazing libraries like
08:50 - psychic
08:51 - learn like django that allows people to
08:55 - build
08:55 - humongous applications right we're
08:57 - talking machine learning
08:58 - we're talking ai we're talking voice
09:01 - assistants like siri
09:02 - we're talking data science or
09:04 - accommodation engines
09:06 - like on amazon where you say hey you
09:08 - might also like this
09:10 - that is why python is so
09:14 - important number one
09:18 - drum roll please javascript
09:24 - now i know you're like nas but no hold
09:27 - on this is not javascript's number no
09:29 - hold on listen to this okay the
09:31 - javascript is
09:33 - it's a language i always recommend to
09:35 - any beginner
09:36 - not only because it's so easy to learn
09:39 - but also because it's visual
09:41 - okay but you write something and you
09:43 - right away
09:44 - see the results this was my first
09:47 - language
09:48 - this is how i got my career started now
09:50 - let's talk about some facts
09:52 - javascript has been the number one
09:54 - programming language on stack over for
09:56 - developer story for the past
09:58 - seven years applications like facebook
10:01 - front end
10:02 - like instagram anything you see on the
10:04 - website
10:06 - what do you think it's built with
10:08 - javascript
10:09 - because of its popularity right we have
10:13 - frameworks like react.js
10:15 - liveview.js like english and and many
10:18 - others
10:18 - to go ahead and come in use javascript
10:21 - to allow
10:22 - people to build more applications tesla
10:24 - for example
10:25 - right especially right now cross
10:28 - platform replication meaning
10:29 - applications for ios
10:31 - and for android are being built with
10:35 - technologies like react native which is
10:37 - using
10:38 - javascript for example tesla the tesla
10:41 - app that you see on the app store
10:43 - that is built using javascript that is
10:45 - built using react native
10:47 - netflix their whole system on the back
10:49 - end they are using node.js
10:51 - with javascript i can go one and
10:55 - on and on guys but all i will say
10:58 - is that it is my recommendation for you
11:02 - to learn if you're an absolute beginner

11:16 - thousand dollars

number five c plus plus now i know you're talking about the new you just bad is so old it's not interesting no shush listen to me c plus plus it is the first languages that came out not only that this is a language that all the other languages stem from if you know c plus you will pretty much be able to learn all the other languages now on top of that some of the top companies uber google amazon facebook they all use c plus plus gaming companies like ea nintendo sony blizzard are all using c plus plus for their gaming engine to build games so if you want to build games like star wars we're talking assassin's creed anything else related to games you need to know c plus plus if you're for example actually machine learning tesla's auto pilot system is actually built on c plus plus like what how crazy is that and according to indeed.com and the average c plus plus developer still makes a hundred and four thousand dollars this is a program language that is not going away anytime soon and is still going to be a very pinnacle of software development number four c sharp now it is a very useful laker that is easy to learn and it was built to compete with java and right now it is having a crazy comeback here's why right now windows applications like microsoft office microsoft excel we're talking photoshop we're talking internet explorer scratch that one though now on top of this right now vr development which is going really high is actually using tsharp so if you are interested in building games with csharp okay this is the place to go over a few years coming it's going to skyrocket like crazy believe me there's an amazing community with csharp developers and you will not be left out another fun fact about csharp is it's actually used for building virtual reality games right we're talking oculus we're talking google the google virtual reality glasses i think right whatever it's called so as it's going up in ranks as more people use virtual reality c is going to be even more popular and more demanded now according to indeed.com c developers right now make over 98 000 on average but i really think it's gonna increase throughout the time with the whole virtual reality aspect number three java now java is a very popular language to learn so when you're talking about building android applications that is what it's used for also very much known in the enterprise software and actually listen this 97 of enterprise applications use java for developing largescale software that means that if you want to work at companies like google like microsoft like uber they all use java for their large applications web applications enterprise software that is what they use now according to indeed.com java developers on average make a hundred and nineteen thousand dollars and in terms of demand at the time of filming there are over 33 000 jobs so the demand is there the necessity is there and based on that it is one of the most demanded programming
