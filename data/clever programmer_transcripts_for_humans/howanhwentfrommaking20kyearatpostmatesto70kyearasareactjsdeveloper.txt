00:00 - and after i told her i was about to cry
00:02 - so i
00:03 - ran grabbed my dogs ran to the car
00:06 - and i cried and i listened to
00:09 - the radio i just drove around because i
00:12 - couldn't really believe it it just drove
00:14 - around
00:15 - this is a interview with one of our
00:17 - students his name is
00:18 - on and how he went from making twenty
00:22 - thousand dollars a year
00:23 - doing postmates to making between
00:26 - seventy thousand two hundred and twenty
00:27 - eight thousand
00:28 - as a reaction developer yeah he enrolled
00:31 - in the full stack mastery boot camp
00:33 - and now we're gonna take it over to on
00:36 - and just so you guys know
00:37 - he started out with basically he went to
00:39 - a different boot camp
00:41 - really felt like he was not being he was
00:43 - not learning much
00:44 - really felt like he was about to just go
00:46 - back to a
00:48 - job that he didn't like like doing post
00:50 - post office or
00:51 - you know amazon flex but then he got
00:54 - into here and was able to learn much
00:56 - more
00:56 - and let it job so with that said let's
00:59 - roll the video let's do it everything
01:02 - was hard for me like
01:03 - i did html css in high school which like
01:06 - 10 plus years ago
01:07 - and we met with like clients and build
01:09 - basic apps basic
01:11 - i built a dog app before i even had a
01:13 - dog and
01:15 - uh and then uh the javascript camera i
01:18 - had a really hard time
01:19 - learning javascript just because i still
01:21 - i don't understand like
01:23 - the language behind the language like
01:25 - deconstruct or string or array like it's
01:27 - still
01:28 - it wasn't clicking for me but when i
01:29 - asked for help the instructor would take
01:31 - two to three weeks
01:32 - maybe even more to even get back to me
01:35 - and if he gets back to me he's like you
01:37 - can figure it out just google it
01:44 - 18k for this like 18k i expect to be a
01:47 - developer by
01:48 - the third or fourth month about putting
01:50 - that amount of money in
01:51 - to this investment so going forward we
01:54 - learned express handlebar which i found
01:56 - out from nasa no one does anymore
01:58 - and then we didn't learn to react until
02:00 - like the fourth or fifth month
02:02 - which was cool weekend i react i'm
02:04 - getting something that i'm used to
02:06 - but their way of teaching it was like
02:10 - once we once we passed this topic
02:13 - there's no going back you're not going
02:14 - to get help from this unless you do it
02:16 - on your own
02:16 - there's no like if we're going to react
02:18 - and i had a question about node
02:20 - we're not going to go back like from it
02:23 - there's nothing
02:24 - like everyone else was i'm not saying
02:26 - everyone else but there's a few of us
02:27 - like i don't know what's going on so we
02:30 - formed like study groups we had projects
02:32 - that we work in groups that we get to
02:33 - choose the people that we need to work
02:35 - with
02:35 - thank god i was with someone that did
02:37 - she's she sar
02:39 - and he was like amazing at coding so at
02:41 - the time he was trying to teach us react
02:43 - and try to teach himself react and and
02:46 - at the very end
02:48 - he decided to do a we just sized the
02:50 - group to make a movie app and we cannot
02:52 - figure out how to do firebase we
02:53 - couldn't figure out how to like
02:55 - link firebase to the app and then i came
02:58 - across
02:58 - clever programmer when you and kazi and
03:01 - i think his name is sunny
03:03 - was doing a clone for spotify
03:06 - so the part that we couldn't figure out
03:08 - was how to get the music to pop up with
03:10 - react when using the api
03:12 - so i took some of the codes i learned
03:14 - from the spotify clone and i added to
03:16 - our project and we're able to pass the
03:18 - project
03:18 - let's go so so yeah yeah that's awesome
03:21 - that's amazing
03:22 - tell me like right you told me when i
03:24 - got a call with you you told me that uh
03:26 - you know
03:27 - after the boot camp that you went to
03:28 - before
03:30 - you were in a very bad spot you were in
03:32 - a very bad place like you wanted to go
03:34 - back to like
03:35 - to work it like a like as a post office
03:37 - man or something right so
03:39 - like why tell me why well
03:42 - well i had some very bad experience it's
03:44 - just like my grandma got cancer so i was
03:47 - focusing on like
03:48 - her more so that's one problem two is
03:51 - like
03:52 - just the experience of like the
03:55 - instructors like
03:56 - do you really like your in your motto of
03:58 - the school is we care about the students
04:00 - we want the students to succeed
04:02 - everything is about the student but once
04:05 - i got that certificate i don't even want
04:07 - to look at the certificate it's sitting
04:08 - right here next to me
04:10 - and every day i look at this and i was
04:12 - like i didn't learn anything
04:14 - i i can't i can't use this like i it can
04:17 - probably get me an interview but i can't
04:19 - get me a job
04:21 - so when i was sitting there i was i
04:23 - shoot
04:24 - at that time uh it was hard you know
04:27 - family problems stuff like that
04:28 - and then i was i to make my grandma
04:30 - proud she just
04:32 - all she ever wanted was just me have a
04:33 - job i'm not end up in jail i'm not
04:36 - she's very basic as long as i'm not in
04:38 - jail i can do whatever hell i want
04:39 - but she was like do something that makes
04:42 - you happy
04:42 - and i was like well at that time i'm
04:44 - gonna do something that makes you
04:45 - happier so i'm gonna
04:46 - apply for boeing i'm applying to be a i
04:49 - don't know work at
04:49 - postman i'm do i did amazon flex for a
04:52 - few months something just to get by pay
04:53 - bills
04:55 - i came across because of the stat
04:59 - the spotify clone i said that i'm gonna
05:02 - give
05:02 - clever programmer a try so i signed up
05:04 - for pwj
05:06 - and uh coffee called me that night night
05:08 - and i [ __ ] boy ever
05:10 - i was kind of embarrassing but the whole
05:12 - time he was talking about welcoming into
05:14 - pwg i was like i can't believe i'm
05:16 - talking to you right now i was just
05:17 - watching you
05:18 - eight hours a day just like last week
05:22 - and then you're actually calling my
05:23 - phone at 10 pm at night and the whole
05:25 - time he was like introducing pwg to me
05:26 - like
05:27 - we were happy to have you join a
05:29 - community this is a lifetime thing and i
05:31 - don't
05:32 - and the whole time i was just like i
05:33 - can't believe you're calling me
05:41 - he called i was like man this is
05:42 - probably something new but i was still
05:44 - in the mood of like i don't want to code
05:45 - no more
05:46 - like if if this is how coding is like if
05:49 - the school is like this
05:50 - imagine how the work is like like if i'm
05:53 - behind is everyone gonna be like
05:55 - nah he's done no we don't care we got
05:57 - his money already or we're only paying
05:59 - him let's turn them out let's just move
06:00 - on
06:00 - or find someone else to replace them so
06:02 - i just thought if it's doggy dog like
06:04 - that then i'd rather just work for a
06:06 - doggy dog company
06:07 - and just you know go on forward so uh
06:11 - and then you guys posted a reaction
06:16 - i said man i got a little bit money for
06:18 - amazon flex i'm just going to join
06:20 - it's it's what a weekend eight hours
06:23 - i'll just do amazon flex and like two or
06:25 - three o'clock in the morning
06:27 - i come home take a nap and i'll do this
06:29 - every single day and then
06:32 - introducing boot camp at the very end
06:35 - at first i was like man another boot
06:37 - camp do i when i want to get yelled
06:39 - at dude how how is this going to work i
06:43 - have no money
06:44 - i have like i thought i had yeah so this
06:48 - is definitely one of the things i'm
06:49 - interested in knowing it's like yeah
06:51 - you went to a boot camp already you
06:52 - invested in it you had a bad experience
06:55 - and you had very little money so what
06:57 - was going through your head
06:58 - when you decided to join this again
07:00 - another
07:01 - another yeah boot camp yeah so uh i had
07:05 - a phone call with daniel and daniel was
07:06 - like
07:06 - you sound like you really want to do
07:08 - this but i'm not gonna pass you on to
07:10 - frankie aka timmy
07:12 - until until uh you
07:15 - are dedicated to this and i really want
07:17 - to get good at coding i
07:18 - i liked it in high school no one really
07:21 - liked high school
07:22 - but then i wanted to do something
07:25 - different
07:25 - i wanted from further on i don't want to
07:28 - be like hey
07:29 - my kid's gonna be like oh he's just
07:30 - another mailman there's no no shout out
07:31 - to
07:32 - mailman's or people that work for boeing
07:33 - all this other stuff but i wanted to do
07:35 - something different where i can teach
07:36 - one day if i'm blessed to have a kid i
07:38 - can teach him how to program and learn
07:39 - the ins and out of
07:40 - the computers and stuff like that
07:42 - software because down the road
07:44 - tech is going to be the one biggest
07:45 - thing in the world
07:48 - so uh i had a talk with frankie
07:52 - i called him timmy at first because i
07:54 - thought that was
07:56 - hilarious
08:03 - you lied to me already and then uh
08:07 - right there and then there was that
08:09 - first obstacle is the money deposit down
08:11 - like
08:12 - for for you for a clever programmer to
08:14 - believe in you
08:15 - you also have to invest in yourself to
08:16 - become part of clever programmer
08:19 - so he gave me a week and uh i have a
08:22 - pride
08:22 - to not ask people for money because i
08:25 - don't know maybe that's just the asian
08:26 - thing but it shows
08:27 - kind of like weakness or something like
08:28 - that but uh i asked
08:30 - my sister and then i asked my brother my
08:32 - sister was like
08:34 - come on you just did a boot camp why are
08:35 - you doing another one like you know
08:37 - typical asian and then uh my brother
08:41 - didn't say anything at first he's a very
08:43 - to himself type of
08:45 - guy and then the next day let's say
08:48 - tuesday tuesday he was like hey
08:50 - do a down payment and pay the rest with
08:52 - amazon flex
08:58 - learn how to code do what you love and
09:00 - not have excuse that money is the reason
09:02 - why you couldn't do this
09:04 - so he works at construction sites so he
09:06 - makes a lot of money
09:07 - but he says that uh you're my brother
09:11 - so i have to take care of you regardless
09:13 - even if i hate you
09:14 - but but that's that's how brothers are
09:17 - he gave me
09:18 - and then uh the [ __ ]
09:22 - or timmy and then uh i said hey i have
09:24 - the money i'm ready to
09:26 - to uh 110 be in this boot camp
09:30 - join let's go and then you join the boot
09:32 - camp yeah yeah dude that is so amazing
09:35 - to have a brother like
09:36 - that because um but they're not like hey
09:39 - here's 5 000 bucks
09:41 - yeah to have somebody that believes so
09:43 - much in you you know to be able to give
09:44 - you the money or just
09:46 - just to have faith in you that is the
09:48 - biggest trust you know just like hey you
09:50 - know what you got this
09:51 - not a lot of people get that and so man
09:53 - you're lucky to have that and you know
09:54 - what and you took that
09:56 - and you were not afraid to ask and you
09:58 - actually invest in yourself
09:59 - and then that resulted in what you have
10:02 - right now and actually being able to pay
10:03 - back
10:04 - your your brother even more is that
10:06 - correct yeah yeah
10:07 - so now i'm curious right so you figured
10:10 - out a way to get into the boot camp
10:11 - figure out the payments you're like hey
10:13 - i'm gonna make it work i'm gonna invest
10:14 - in myself i'll join this
10:16 - but now i'm curious and people who are
10:18 - probably listening to this are curious
10:20 - how did you go from that to
10:23 - being able to get a job so like walk me
10:25 - through what happened you know kind of
10:26 - step by step
10:27 - yeah what made this different that
10:29 - allowed you to get there
10:34 - so at first i just thought hey i already
10:35 - did the boot camp this boot camp is just
10:37 - gonna be review of what i just missed
10:40 - i basically missed everything about
10:41 - javascript when i did this boot camp
10:44 - so uh they we miss what is that
10:46 - hexadecimal was the very first lesson i
10:48 - was like what is this
10:50 - what what do you mean zeros and ones i
10:52 - thought computers just you just type it
10:53 - in they know what the heck they're
10:54 - talking about
10:55 - i've been learning softwares of
10:56 - different companies so you just have to
10:58 - type in and then it saves itself
11:00 - i didn't know there's like a whole like
11:03 - different dimension basically to it
11:05 - so uh first week
11:08 - i hated it to be honest i hated it it
11:11 - was like
11:13 - nas i love you and everything you're the
11:16 - best i've ever had
11:18 - you put me in the hot seat every single
11:20 - single time
11:22 - and then that's what we do
11:29 - he's like you think you know what you're
11:31 - talking about okay
11:33 - so he picks on you and then it starts i
11:36 - wanted to test here right
11:37 - i'm here to test students right to make
11:39 - sure that you guys
11:40 - know what you're talking about because
11:41 - sometimes you don't know what you don't
11:42 - know
11:43 - yeah yeah and so that's when you realize
11:45 - what you don't know yeah so
11:47 - it was it was at the same time i was
11:48 - like man possibly different i'm just
11:50 - having cold sweat
11:51 - i'm like not really relaxed learning in
11:53 - class like this is different from any
11:55 - class i've ever been in
11:56 - so after a while it got fun and then it
12:00 - got really challenging but we were all
12:01 - excited
12:02 - and then i think i think that's part of
12:04 - this boot camp
12:05 - was how we all became like family within
12:09 - a week or two
12:10 - like there wasn't no you i'll be scared
12:12 - to message this person because i never
12:14 - met this person it was none of that
12:16 - my first thing when i first came in was
12:18 - my last boot camp every time i try to
12:19 - crack a joke i'm more like a class clown
12:21 - just to break the ice with like the
12:23 - group that i'm in
12:24 - just so it makes everyone welcome first
12:26 - because i'm i already feel like i'm okay
12:29 - but for other students or like people
12:31 - it's hard for them to break in and you
12:33 - know talk about themselves or like
12:34 - be comfortable talking to you vice versa
12:37 - so i made a joke about hexadecimals and
12:39 - it still lasts to
12:40 - this day and uh
12:44 - it i was afraid when i cracked that joke
12:45 - no one's going to laugh i was like oh
12:46 - it's going to be another boot camp
12:50 - but remember that we're gonna get
12:52 - t-shirts that says 15.
12:57 - study group that we have uh i feel like
13:00 - i can hit up
13:00 - anyone in the group and be like hey i
13:02 - need help with this code
13:04 - and they're like yeah you got time to
13:05 - zoom like you'll get that from
13:07 - instructors you don't really get that
13:08 - from students you usually get like if
13:10 - you hit up as
13:10 - an instructor they'd be like yeah just
13:12 - give me some time i'll make time for you
13:15 - not for my last boot camp but this boot
13:16 - camp and then if you hit up a student
13:18 - like hey you have time to study they're
13:20 - like yeah just give me 10 15 minutes
13:22 - i might have you know and we're all over
13:24 - the world this could be
13:26 - morning was what one am and i hit him up
13:29 - and he was like yeah i can help you
13:31 - understand some codes he sent me some
13:32 - links and stuff like that
13:34 - the links don't make sense because i
13:35 - don't know like you know
13:37 - but he's there they were there and then
13:40 - every time we meet
13:41 - every tuesday thursday saturday sunday
13:44 - no everyone's you have a bad day or have
13:47 - a good day
13:47 - knowledge comes and makes us stretch
13:49 - makes us feel comfortable and then
13:51 - he we relax for the first five ten
13:53 - minutes of class and we go right right
13:54 - dance too every call yeah yeah right
13:59 - he's like i don't care two-piece combo
14:00 - to the head of coding
14:02 - like he knows we have a headache from it
14:04 - we know we were confused
14:05 - but it slowly slowly like hits
14:09 - like a hacker rank he introduced the
14:11 - hacker rank leak code
14:12 - and at first i looked at so my last
14:15 - problem was
14:16 - i figured out was i can't problem solve
14:19 - i can problem solve in real life but
14:21 - when it comes down to coding
14:22 - it's a lot different like you're giving
14:25 - instructions of how to
14:27 - stuff out and then you're giving a
14:28 - process of how do you
14:30 - break this down to write out so you do
14:33 - pseudo code
14:34 - and then the next step after that is to
14:36 - write the code so
14:38 - nas will do like a bunch of examples it
14:40 - can be try
14:41 - binary search it can be stack queue
14:44 - all that but he would write us out in
14:47 - pseudocode basically writing us the code
14:49 - we just have to figure out
14:50 - what the code is in javascript and then
14:53 - it's
14:53 - at first i was like oh god damn it
14:55 - javascript data structures this is
14:57 - different
14:58 - i didn't learn this from the last
14:59 - bootcamp they just told us how to make a
15:01 - app
15:01 - and they gave us the bootstrap all we
15:03 - have to do is write in the thing to make
15:04 - the buttons work that's it
15:06 - but now now dude can i just say i'm so
15:09 - proud of you
15:10 - for even being able to know what those
15:12 - are like
15:13 - try right binary saying it up i'm like
15:16 - holy moly like 90 people don't even know
15:19 - that right
15:20 - so but you've been able to know that
15:22 - understand it
15:23 - right you already already understand
15:26 - problem solving you already understand
15:27 - data structures which is
15:28 - the foundational programming right so
15:30 - like man
15:31 - proud of you for even just knowing that
15:33 - you know yeah and it's a singular reason
15:34 - why most people don't get jobs
15:36 - yeah because their foundations are weak
15:39 - yeah yeah yeah
15:40 - it's not that that so so let's just say
15:43 - data structures in life he's teaching us
15:45 - how to break things down
15:47 - in code and then figure out how to solve
15:50 - them
15:50 - but i often use that in real life that
15:53 - you can break stuff down
15:54 - and solve it see there's always a
15:57 - solution to something you just have to
15:59 - figure out how to do
16:00 - step by step so
16:03 - at first i was it was very difficult i
16:06 - had a hard time with hacker rank because
16:07 - there's so
16:08 - much there's so much problems there's
16:09 - there's easy medium advance
16:12 - and then nas introduced us to try hybrid
16:14 - i hated that
16:15 - the most the most but it was what you
16:17 - just decided
16:20 - it's combined so my goal is always to
16:23 - have what you learn here and how to
16:25 - learn here
16:25 - and to combine it right because it's not
16:27 - just about knowing like stacks or cues
16:29 - it's about learning okay how do i use
16:31 - both of them right together how do i use
16:32 - a tree together with a linked list or
16:34 - something something like right so
16:36 - you've been able to use all the
16:37 - different tools in your tool belt
16:39 - together that's what makes you a
16:40 - powerful developer right and so my goal
16:42 - is always to kind of mix and match with
16:43 - that
16:44 - yeah so let's get to the fun part where
16:47 - i decided to do
16:48 - internship at this certain company i'm
16:50 - not gonna say the name
16:52 - i'm very uh super sisters so until i see
16:55 - that piece of paper with the offer sheet
16:56 - i'm not even gonna mention the name i
16:58 - just told you guys but i'm not gonna
17:00 - mention it again because i'm very
17:01 - superstitious until i get that first
17:02 - direct deposit
17:04 - and then i'll brag all the day all day i
17:05 - want so
17:07 - uh about a month ago i was really having
17:09 - a hard time keeping up with class
17:11 - and i got offers from different places
17:15 - and before we could use how long were
17:18 - you in the boot camp so far
17:20 - just so we're aware january yeah march
17:24 - march
17:25 - two months into the program
17:29 - got it continued and then uh
17:32 - so i i was i'm a type of person where
17:35 - i'm very
17:36 - i have to know the code i have to be
17:39 - ready for this interview i have to be
17:41 - you know a hundred percent before i get
17:44 - to this interview i'm not going to do
17:45 - the interview
17:46 - jesse one of the instructors let's say
17:48 - ta part of clever program was like
17:51 - just do it the if you get hired you just
17:54 - got hired two months in the boot camp
17:57 - why why are you not applying like
17:58 - there's a bunch of people that apply 100
18:01 - 200 applications they don't get it you
18:02 - guys know what i'm talking about
18:04 - but i'm just saying like we like the
18:07 - mindset of just like being nervous and
18:09 - being scared is not going to be good for
18:11 - you because you'll never want to do it
18:13 - like before this i used to sell vacuums
18:15 - and i did amazon flex was like
18:17 - jobs i hated but if i can do that why
18:20 - can't i just
18:21 - you know apply for a job and then let's
18:23 - see if they like me just as a person
18:26 - or if i'm just you know critical thinker
18:28 - if i'm just a problem solver and they
18:29 - just have to re-teach me
18:31 - how they code but as long as i get the
18:34 - foot in the door at least they're
18:35 - teaching they're like they're paying me
18:36 - to relearn how to code like them so i
18:40 - was like man
18:40 - forget it i'm just gonna apply 20 30
18:43 - jobs but
18:44 - my main goal is this certain job since
18:47 - 2019
18:48 - how the ceo is how the companies run
18:50 - it's in seattle
18:52 - i want to be part of this business i'll
18:54 - be intern i
18:55 - apply to be intern i'll do janitor work
18:58 - i'll bring people's coffee i'll get
18:59 - people's mail
19:00 - uh you want me clean your shoe i'll
19:02 - clean your shoe it's just
19:04 - i just want to be part of this company i
19:07 - don't care what i have to do
19:09 - i'll print paper all day if you want me
19:12 - to
19:12 - i'll walk around with you while you do
19:14 - sales or i'll grab
19:16 - hold your umbrella i don't care i just
19:18 - want to be part of this company
19:20 - so i i i've been to their meeting a lot
19:24 - of zoom calls
19:27 - i don't know what's going on in the
19:29 - business but it's because i'm a novice
19:30 - to
19:31 - the company so after a while they said
19:34 - hey you want to come in check out our
19:35 - facility
19:37 - as long as you get vaccines or stuff
19:38 - like that or you just come in with a
19:40 - covet
19:40 - negative results so i walked in for
19:45 - a few times and i i loved it
19:48 - their their their atmosphere is just
19:50 - like clever programmer they want you to
19:52 - learn
19:52 - they want they're all employees are
19:54 - treated equal there's
19:56 - just this mindset where it reminds me so
19:58 - much of clever program i was like this
19:59 - is even a plus
20:01 - i'm going to stay here for
20:05 - resolve stuff in seattle and then i
20:06 - decided to come down to california be
20:08 - part of clever programmer
20:10 - but that's the main goal and then um
20:13 - when i got the offer what was it
20:16 - yesterday
20:22 - um i got the offer yesterday i was
20:25 - sitting right here in the same exact
20:26 - spot and i looked at myself and i looked
20:28 - at
20:28 - uh the stack full mastery and i was like
20:30 - i want to tell people
20:31 - but the very first person i wanted to
20:33 - call was you nas but you never never
20:36 - went
20:37 - back i was busy man i'm sorry i was busy
20:41 - i called frankie didn't even pick up uh
20:45 - so at that time it was 11 a.m i joined
20:47 - jessie's
20:49 - uh react class that she hosted every
20:51 - tuesday
20:52 - and i told her and after i told her
20:55 - i was about to cry so i ran
20:58 - grabbed my dogs ran to the car and i
21:00 - cried
21:02 - and i listened to the radio i just drove
21:05 - around
21:05 - because i couldn't really believe it i
21:07 - just drove around
21:09 - for like 25 35 minutes
21:12 - qazi and uh and frankie called me around
21:15 - like
21:16 - two three o'clock pst time and they're
21:19 - like we heard we heard
21:20 - you got the job i was like yeah but
21:22 - there's something else that happened
21:24 - and i've been very quiet about this
21:25 - because nas taught us
21:28 - don't say it until you get it just get
21:30 - it first and then you can brag all you
21:31 - want
21:32 - so another position came up not really a
21:35 - position but my brother-in-law runs a
21:36 - real estate and
21:37 - uh remodel houses and he resells the
21:40 - house and stuff like that
21:41 - but the thing for his clients is he
21:43 - doesn't have like
21:44 - he doesn't want to do a form to write
21:46 - out the parts he needs to remodel
21:49 - how much the price is so he decided to
21:52 - hire me
21:53 - to run to make his website with a
21:56 - database where he can see the
21:58 - pricing for each place that you pick up
22:00 - the like wood or like
22:02 - how many nails you need and stuff like
22:03 - that or if you want a new bathtub or
22:05 - like stuff like that
22:06 - so he said that he'll pay me two
22:08 - thousand dollars every two weeks
22:14 - are you sure you won't pay me that much
22:16 - like i'll take i'll do for free
22:18 - for what is he what is he going to be
22:19 - paying you for he's he's
22:22 - just outside trouble and not basically
22:24 - his assistant
22:25 - of like hey what did they buy put it
22:28 - together
22:28 - go get the parts and then i have a van
22:31 - or truck and i just have to drop off the
22:33 - part he's paying me two thousand dollars
22:35 - just to do a little bit of
22:36 - uh heavy lifting but control like
22:39 - maintenance of his uh website
22:41 - i am thinking i might not be able to do
22:43 - it myself so i am going to partner up
22:45 - with one of my
22:46 - old teammates have somebody else do the
22:50 - physical work you do the web development
22:52 - work
22:53 - but i'm fine it's a family business so i
22:55 - can do anything to help his business
22:56 - grow
22:57 - and uh so this is what does that mean
23:00 - for a year if it's like a year long
23:03 - that's like what 4 000 a month yeah
23:08 - it was 52 i think me just one second
23:16 - okay so 4 000
23:20 - times 12 is forty eight thousand
23:22 - thousand dollars forty eight thousand
23:24 - so that's outside of so that's forty
23:26 - eight thousand a year
23:27 - doing this outside of your current
23:30 - seventy thousand dollar a year
23:31 - job that you're hoping you're gonna get
23:34 - right knock on wood
23:35 - yes but we're pretty sure that you're
23:37 - going to get it so that would if you had
23:38 - both of them
23:40 - that would be 70 000 a year plus
23:44 - the 48 000. so that's about 120
23:48 - something thousand which is fantastic
23:49 - dude and that's your
23:50 - first job as a developer i mean that's
23:52 - freaking amazing
23:54 - yeah i didn't believe it when uh you
23:55 - guys couple months ago said
23:57 - stay with us there's a chance it's true
23:59 - initiative work hard
24:01 - learn how to code we know our [ __ ] baby
24:04 - we know our [ __ ] let's go
24:06 - yeah when we first came it was like
24:09 - everyone that did the boot camp or
24:10 - they're like a retreat that has 101
24:13 - guidance from you guys as mentors
24:15 - minimum 52.
24:16 - i would never imagine my side would be
24:19 - times two of that
24:20 - i would never imagine out i'm happy with
24:22 - just the 70
24:24 - but then when my brother-in-law was like
24:25 - hey i see that you're doing good in this
24:28 - boot camp
24:29 - and you're always going to school like
24:30 - i'm always like
24:32 - i'm always texting like hey i'll be late
24:34 - i gotta finish this class i don't care
24:35 - if it's eight o'clock i'll go to home
24:37 - depot at nine o'clock i don't care but i
24:38 - have to do this now and then i can leave
24:42 - so he just showed like i'll be i'll be
24:43 - working to like with him
24:45 - you know 11 to midnight some sometimes
24:48 - he just sees like hey
24:49 - he this kid is doing school
24:52 - trying to get a full-time job plus
24:55 - helping me on the side
24:56 - because you know he owes so he can't
24:58 - really lift that much and then
25:00 - he's just like instead of just now
25:03 - i said i'll do it for free just to show
25:06 - that hey it's a family business i'll
25:07 - take care of things we're doing this
25:08 - together it's family
25:10 - but the fact that he's he's like hey
25:12 - i'll pay you
25:13 - from just the property make some selling
25:15 - houses he'll just pay me
25:16 - every two weeks or just pay me once a
25:18 - month i don't mind my fourth house
25:21 - i don't i don't mind on top of it you
25:22 - get to learn right so it's always
25:24 - always a learning opportunity at the
25:26 - same time you get bbs can be paid to
25:28 - learn
25:29 - it doesn't get better but i want to ask
25:32 - you a question okay so
25:33 - what did you like you told me one thing
25:35 - it's one thing when i got on a call with
25:36 - you and i
25:37 - was like holy [ __ ] it's amazing and i
25:39 - was so happy for you right
25:41 - you tell me one thing in terms of what
25:43 - you learned from this bootcamp that
25:45 - really kind of
25:46 - really transformed your mindset when you
25:47 - went into the interview
25:49 - like what was it tell me dude this just
25:52 - just happened
25:53 - tuesday right just it just happened no
25:55 - last sunday sunday
25:56 - not bad i'm losing track of days now so
25:59 - sunday
26:00 - uh we had a student i'm not gonna say
26:01 - his name that was uh working at
26:04 - internship and then he was just
26:05 - describing how his internship was going
26:07 - nas was like be the ceo
26:11 - of wherever the hell you want to work
26:13 - you have to go in this show initiative
26:15 - you have to show that you can make more
26:17 - money for this company
26:19 - let's just say you're irreplaceable
26:20 - basically like you got to know what
26:22 - you're talking about you can show
26:24 - it's the action that matters you can
26:26 - show that you can actually do this
26:28 - so i walked into that interview i was
26:30 - like i'm not going to be nervous i'm not
26:31 - going to cross my legs i'm not going to
26:32 - show hand
26:33 - motion even though i had a button up and
26:35 - i had like boxers on but they couldn't
26:37 - really see the
26:38 - bottom of much they just have to see
26:40 - that
26:42 - professional and then like home body at
26:44 - the bottom
26:49 - very i was very outgoing i made a lot of
26:51 - jokes they see that i'm very outgoing
26:52 - person
26:53 - i made the room kind of like la it's
26:55 - it's always fun
26:56 - like we're here to have fun you're here
26:58 - to see how i am as a person this is how
26:59 - i am as a person
27:00 - i'll get stuff done i'm not going to
27:03 - complain or make excuses
27:04 - there's no excuses it's either you do it
27:07 - you don't do it there's there's no like
27:09 - i don't know what happened it's either
27:11 - you didn't do it or you didn't do it or
27:13 - you did it so the fact that nods just
27:15 - changed the mindset of just like
27:17 - making excuses blaming other people like
27:20 - you didn't do this
27:21 - the fact that i used to blame my old
27:23 - boot camp for how
27:24 - i didn't like coding was completely
27:26 - wrong it was wrong
27:29 - there's a bunch of developers that came
27:31 - out that boot camp it's just my
27:32 - experience
27:33 - was bad that's one out of like you know
27:35 - hundreds of kids that did that boot camp
27:37 - but instead of making that excuse i
27:39 - decided to join this boot camp
27:41 - and listen to what nas had to say liam
27:43 - had to say jesse had to say daniel every
27:44 - time he popped in
27:45 - here and there khazi coming up with like
27:47 - exercise throughout the class just do it
27:50 - and then the outcome would be dependent
27:52 - all the outcome will depend on you
27:54 - is you you do it or not if you don't
27:56 - don't do it
27:58 - developers let me let me okay like
28:01 - another
28:02 - interesting thing i want to ask you is
28:04 - in this boot camp
28:06 - what were some of the hardest moments
28:08 - for you oh that's interesting
28:12 - i bet there are a lot okay
28:16 - so uh this this this part um i thought
28:19 - it was pretty funny
28:20 - so we just got done with data structures
28:22 - right and uh
28:24 - liam kind of gave us a hint that we're
28:25 - gonna go to front end
28:27 - and i was like oh friend ends easy all i
28:29 - have to do is display flex that's all i
28:31 - have to do
28:32 - easy and then he gave us this
28:36 - porno dora app of like a timer
28:41 - yeah and i'm just sitting there i was
28:42 - like how are you supposed to make
28:46 - the timer go with the orange
28:49 - circular to like match up and then i was
28:52 - like not the front end was easy
28:54 - that is a lie so the fact that i
28:57 - underestimate front end front end is
28:59 - just as hard as back-end
29:00 - because you have to be it's just as hard
29:03 - so
29:03 - i was like okay no more data structures
29:05 - thank god
29:07 - but there's no way this bootcamp is
29:08 - going to be easy i already knew that
29:10 - it's going to be my like there's no way
29:11 - that he takes a relaxing two weeks
29:13 - there's never a time that he takes
29:14 - like the easy two weeks so we decided to
29:17 - go back inside front end and then we did
29:18 - a couple of apps and front ends from
29:21 - uh what is that a front-end mentor
29:24 - and i was like oh he's just gonna try to
29:25 - get us back in front and learn a bit you
29:27 - know before we get inside react
29:30 - and the most challenging was switching
29:33 - from
29:34 - data structures where i thought i had a
29:36 - grasp on and then he decided to do
29:39 - a front-end uh spotify
29:43 - search bar with instead of using
29:46 - javascript he wants you to use link lin
29:49 - link
29:49 - bliss and then auto completely
30:01 - we did do that but he started out with
30:02 - api async away
30:04 - functions first and then he goes there's
30:07 - a better way to do with react
30:09 - so we bumped into react and i'm just
30:11 - like sitting back i sat back in class
30:13 - one time it's like
30:15 - this project isn't done this project
30:17 - isn't done that project isn't done
30:19 - but nas is number one thing is just do
30:22 - it
30:23 - you have to do it if you do it you get
30:26 - it
30:27 - you turn it in you get to look back once
30:30 - you add that to your portfolios you
30:31 - did this app but
30:38 - it's very very challenging very
30:40 - challenging it's very hard
30:42 - i'm not going to say you should think of
30:44 - this as boot camp where he's
30:45 - where nas is going to show you the
30:47 - demonstrations and then give you
30:49 - activities and then like
30:50 - tutor you how to code and then move on
30:52 - hell no
30:53 - he would legitimately call like he would
30:55 - finish her code
30:56 - and then he'd be like hmm who who do i
30:59 - think not paying attention or who's
31:01 - pretending to pay attention
31:02 - he calls us out on it which at first i
31:04 - was like oh this is fun but then he
31:06 - starts calling me
31:07 - out only sometimes i'm just like i got
31:10 - this i'm not nervous no more
31:13 - but then
31:23 - but here's the thing by calling you out
31:24 - right that made you more vigilant but
31:26 - also
31:26 - calling you out it made you more
31:29 - confident
31:29 - to go into the interview right yeah
31:33 - and i want to ask you a question for you
31:35 - what was it that they
31:37 - hired you for right like i didn't get
31:39 - that part from you like what
31:40 - was it only the behavioral questions
31:42 - like was it you cracking jokes and them
31:44 - just loving your vibe and they
31:47 - thought hey let's just bring this person
31:48 - on or
31:50 - what what made them say yes to bringing
31:54 - you on into their company and giving you
31:56 - a job offer well
31:57 - they gave me like different um let's say
31:59 - situations of how i would deal with
32:01 - you know problem solving so let's say
32:04 - for example
32:05 - if a software is messing up how would i
32:08 - go to solve it with no help
32:10 - let's say it's that you're basically i t
32:12 - but let's say no one's there to help you
32:14 - how would you solve this how would you
32:16 - go about it
32:18 - well one thing i learned from ingrid one
32:19 - of your past students is she wrote out a
32:21 - list of how she solved things is
32:24 - output input complexity pseudo code
32:28 - and then code so when you break that
32:31 - down into bits and pieces as you know
32:33 - how the software works
32:35 - you know how to debug it because once
32:37 - you learn how to debug it you should
32:39 - know how that software works
32:41 - figure out like what's the problem the
32:43 - first complexity is like what is wrong
32:45 - with it
32:46 - is there different ways to solve it and
32:47 - let's say pseudo code
32:49 - what are the steps of making this let's
32:52 - say
32:52 - problem solving of how did that error
32:54 - come up in the first place
32:56 - for let's say step one step two would be
32:58 - trying to figure out how to solve that
33:00 - problem
33:01 - and step three just solve it and there's
33:04 - a lot of stuff
33:05 - with they asked me how would i deal with
33:09 - like
33:09 - if i was stuck on something if i
33:12 - couldn't
33:12 - like if i was i couldn't learn it or
33:14 - something like that like a learning
33:15 - situation where everyone goes to
33:17 - i just told them hey i'm gonna take a
33:20 - walk with my dogs
33:21 - or when i get if i can't solve it that
33:23 - day i'm gonna i'm gonna
33:24 - take a break come back but i'm gonna
33:27 - think about it all
33:28 - all night that's all we think about is
33:30 - how to solve that problem all night
33:32 - and when i get back inside the next day
33:35 - i'm going to solve that
33:36 - or ask you any technical questions as
33:39 - well or no
33:41 - they asked me it was uh
33:45 - it was uh i think they asked me linked
33:47 - lists
33:49 - how to make a linked list how to catch
33:50 - api or how to fetch api
33:53 - um
33:56 - i think there's one more but i couldn't
33:58 - really did you solve any of them or did
34:00 - you fail
34:01 - in those questions when you were
34:02 - answering i know i
34:04 - failed um the second technical question
34:07 - because uh
34:08 - i was at that time it was an hour and a
34:10 - half in they asked me at the very end so
34:12 - i was like
34:13 - my energy is basically kind of gone i
34:15 - was just kind of like just
34:17 - thinking of ways of how to solve the
34:18 - problem and i wasn't like quiet about it
34:21 - i was like
34:22 - scratching my head or i was like rubbing
34:24 - my chin is winning or usually when i
34:25 - think
34:26 - but one thing about me is when i get
34:28 - nervous i make jokes by that time i knew
34:30 - it was not time to make junk this is
34:31 - serious
34:32 - so i was like at this time i'm just
34:34 - going to be like hey this is how i would
34:35 - solve it
34:37 - step by step by step but if something
34:39 - error pops up
34:40 - my resources would be books for google
34:42 - and at that time i'll use that to solve
34:44 - this problem
34:45 - going forward if there's people around
34:46 - me then i'll ask for
34:48 - help but this these are the first steps
34:50 - that i would do so go back to output
34:52 - input complexity
34:54 - pseudo code code and that's actually
34:57 - very important is like right when you go
34:58 - ahead and
34:59 - when you go to the interview it's not
35:00 - just that you've been able to solve the
35:01 - problem
35:02 - it's you being able to talk through it
35:05 - yeah right because that's what they're
35:07 - looking for is they're looking for
35:08 - people who can
35:09 - communicate who can talk through a
35:11 - problem even even for example if they
35:12 - can't fully write it or maybe they get
35:14 - it wrong
35:15 - but most importantly hey can you talk
35:17 - with someone can you work with a team
35:19 - to solve it yeah because you're going to
35:21 - be working with the team and they want
35:22 - to see how would this person communicate
35:25 - their lack of understanding or or
35:29 - their actual understanding to other
35:31 - people on the team
35:32 - and if they screw up will they take
35:34 - ownership or will they lie
35:35 - and make up [ __ ] and not take
35:37 - ownership over this so all of those
35:39 - things come into play so even when
35:40 - you're on zoom calls and now it's
35:41 - calling you out
35:42 - you working under that pressure
35:44 - answering him explaining
35:46 - is really helping you even for those
35:47 - interviews so
35:49 - yeah i love that like how your journey
35:51 - went
35:52 - it had you know it's like you have to
35:54 - learn coding and master that
35:56 - but on top of it you have to actually be
35:58 - confident take a chance in yourself
36:00 - right and actually apply for that
36:03 - internship even though mentally you were
36:04 - like hey i'm not going to apply
36:06 - so like jesse and nas pushed you to
36:09 - apply
36:10 - right so it's a lot of it is mindset
36:12 - work as well
36:14 - so that's incredible i mean you have
36:17 - this amazing job offer
36:18 - so tell me what does your life look like
36:21 - after
36:22 - going from this boot camp like what is
36:23 - it going to be looking like for you now
36:25 - what are you excited about
36:30 - i know the first few months is a lot of
36:32 - adjusting but
36:34 - i'm very lenient i'm i'm ready to learn
36:37 - as much as i can
36:38 - i'm at age where i i don't want to stop
36:40 - learning because
36:42 - we're like i already invested so much
36:44 - money on coding
36:45 - so there's there's more steps i want to
36:47 - learn how to play guitar i want to learn
36:48 - like a bunch of stuff more
36:50 - and stuff like that i don't want to
36:52 - learn how to dance from nas but that can
36:53 - wait down the road
36:55 - but it's just at this moment in time i
36:58 - wanted to i wanted to
36:59 - from all my past things is i always
37:02 - wanted a stable job
37:03 - i always wanted a job where they care
37:05 - about the employees
37:07 - the ceo is inspirational to me like i
37:10 - even messaged him
37:11 - right when i got the show like you're
37:12 - still inspiration to me i still want to
37:14 - clean your shoes but i'm just saying
37:15 - you know you just you gotta stay humble
37:17 - and hungry at the same time
37:19 - it's just the mindset of nah i don't
37:21 - know how it is going to be in the future
37:23 - because
37:24 - i haven't thought that far but the fact
37:27 - that
37:27 - i'm not nervous no more or the fact that
37:31 - i'm not like scared of like what what am
37:33 - i going to do
37:34 - in five ten years like am i gonna
37:37 - deliver
37:38 - mail am i gonna do amazon flex am i
37:40 - gonna
37:41 - learn how to become electrician so i can
37:43 - work for boeing for
37:45 - an airplane company like i don't have to
37:47 - do that no more the plan that i set out
37:49 - from 2009 to basically yesterday
37:53 - knock on wood is accomplished my now my
37:56 - next goal
37:57 - is to work at this place first no until
37:59 - i feel comfortable enough about my
38:01 - skills
38:02 - where maybe one day i'll go down to
38:04 - california and work with you guys
38:06 - and maybe maybe that's fantastic
38:11 - and we decided to open up like a school
38:12 - or something down there who knows no we
38:14 - are planning to do that that'll be
38:15 - amazing
38:17 - and we would love to talk about that so
38:19 - dude i'm so excited you're
38:20 - like just to flashback right you
38:24 - come into this program you're doing
38:26 - postmates making 20 000
38:28 - a year you go through this now you're
38:30 - potentially looking at making between 70
38:32 - 000 to 128 000
38:34 - a year that is absolutely freaking
38:37 - fantastic dude you should be really
38:38 - proud of yourself
38:39 - for putting in the work taking the
38:41 - chance on yourself
38:43 - being humble having that humility you
38:45 - know deflecting with humor but i think
38:47 - that helps
38:48 - you know people like you yeah for that
38:50 - right
38:53 - so
38:57 - yeah but it's okay i love that
38:59 - light-heartedness is freaking awesome
39:00 - dude
39:01 - so now this is amazing i'm excited would
39:04 - you recommend
39:06 - somebody who's thinking about joining
39:08 - full stack mastery boot camp and wants
39:10 - to be a part of it and they're thinking
39:12 - about it they're on the fence
39:13 - would you recommend this program to them
39:16 - no i have no hesitation
39:18 - and why tell them why
39:21 - man you just have to come in for me come
39:24 - on i just almost gave up coding
39:26 - the fact that the instructors care even
39:28 - if you go
39:30 - even they don't even you don't ever have
39:32 - to hit them up they hit you up through
39:34 - messages like hey how are you doing with
39:35 - this code
39:36 - like the effort that you guys put in to
39:38 - actually care about the students is
39:40 - number one
39:40 - the fact that if the students know that
39:42 - the instructors care
39:43 - they give their effort even more and the
39:46 - fact that you hear rumors about
39:48 - other boot camps like how come they
39:50 - never succeed
39:51 - like they probably do succeed just
39:53 - depending on the person
39:54 - but the fact that the rumors of like
39:57 - school were like
39:58 - gap and stuff like that and now if you
40:01 - just
40:02 - join this force mastery boot camp
40:05 - there's a better chance of you actually
40:07 - getting a job and they're gonna help you
40:09 - until you get a job they're going to
40:11 - help you with databases
40:13 - front-end back-end mock interviews you
40:16 - can practice doing a capstone
40:19 - capstone basically there's some there's
40:20 - people coming in they want you to build
40:22 - their website you work as a team
40:24 - you talk to the client to build them a
40:26 - website
40:27 - and in the end or other what other
40:29 - places can you get all that within the
40:32 - time
40:32 - frame of you being part of the boot camp
40:34 - and it's very it's the only thing
40:36 - difficult i see
40:36 - is the time of how you how we are
40:40 - not so for bootcamp is usually like
40:42 - states or
40:43 - us but you guys are global
40:47 - global like you can help people from
40:49 - india vietnam
40:51 - russia as long as you're a part of this
40:53 - they they're they're able to get in
40:55 - without being
40:56 - 10 15 20 000 in depth and you guys have
41:00 - a payment plan that works out
41:02 - you guys have a team that'll communicate
41:05 - with us
41:06 - let's say you can afford it they'll work
41:08 - out a plan for you to even attend as
41:09 - long as you're committed
41:11 - as long as you put in time class is
41:13 - going to be fun
41:14 - it's going to be challenging it's going
41:16 - to be there's probably going to be some
41:18 - days where you don't want to go to class
41:19 - but the fact that if you feel like
41:22 - coding is hard once you join the
41:24 - coaching call every tuesday thursday
41:26 - saturday sunday you want to continue
41:27 - coding that's so great about nas
41:30 - is you feel so much of a headache
41:33 - you don't want to code no more and then
41:35 - when you get inside coaching call it
41:36 - just clicks
41:38 - instantly so where can you get that
41:39 - anywhere else school you like i don't
41:40 - want to go
41:41 - class i'll just skip class forget class
41:43 - even though i paid 20
41:44 - 000 for class sometimes you don't want
41:46 - to go for class right
41:48 - even if just this you want to be
41:51 - in class yeah that's absolutely amazing

45:24 - have any questions we can definitely
45:26 - answer them for you
45:27 - and if this is if you're a good fit yeah
45:30 - and it makes sense we can let you know
45:31 - how it works okay
45:32 - just to let you know not everybody does
45:34 - get in depends on how committed you are

45:44 - yeah we have application process and
45:46 - everything that we can tell you about
45:47 - but
45:47 - you know 76 to 78 percent people we
45:51 - unfortunately do not accept them because
45:53 - we want to make sure we're taking the
45:55 - people that
45:55 - are like on that can actually put in
45:57 - that work and
45:59 - succeed and bring that and bring good
46:02 - energy that's the most important thing

46:12 - ahead and do that with that said this is
46:14 - your boy kazi
46:16 - and nas we will see you in the next
46:20 - video

Cleaned transcript:

and after i told her i was about to cry so i ran grabbed my dogs ran to the car and i cried and i listened to the radio i just drove around because i couldn't really believe it it just drove around this is a interview with one of our students his name is on and how he went from making twenty thousand dollars a year doing postmates to making between seventy thousand two hundred and twenty eight thousand as a reaction developer yeah he enrolled in the full stack mastery boot camp and now we're gonna take it over to on and just so you guys know he started out with basically he went to a different boot camp really felt like he was not being he was not learning much really felt like he was about to just go back to a job that he didn't like like doing post post office or you know amazon flex but then he got into here and was able to learn much more and let it job so with that said let's roll the video let's do it everything was hard for me like i did html css in high school which like 10 plus years ago and we met with like clients and build basic apps basic i built a dog app before i even had a dog and uh and then uh the javascript camera i had a really hard time learning javascript just because i still i don't understand like the language behind the language like deconstruct or string or array like it's still it wasn't clicking for me but when i asked for help the instructor would take two to three weeks maybe even more to even get back to me and if he gets back to me he's like you can figure it out just google it 18k for this like 18k i expect to be a developer by the third or fourth month about putting that amount of money in to this investment so going forward we learned express handlebar which i found out from nasa no one does anymore and then we didn't learn to react until like the fourth or fifth month which was cool weekend i react i'm getting something that i'm used to but their way of teaching it was like once we once we passed this topic there's no going back you're not going to get help from this unless you do it on your own there's no like if we're going to react and i had a question about node we're not going to go back like from it there's nothing like everyone else was i'm not saying everyone else but there's a few of us like i don't know what's going on so we formed like study groups we had projects that we work in groups that we get to choose the people that we need to work with thank god i was with someone that did she's she sar and he was like amazing at coding so at the time he was trying to teach us react and try to teach himself react and and at the very end he decided to do a we just sized the group to make a movie app and we cannot figure out how to do firebase we couldn't figure out how to like link firebase to the app and then i came across clever programmer when you and kazi and i think his name is sunny was doing a clone for spotify so the part that we couldn't figure out was how to get the music to pop up with react when using the api so i took some of the codes i learned from the spotify clone and i added to our project and we're able to pass the project let's go so so yeah yeah that's awesome that's amazing tell me like right you told me when i got a call with you you told me that uh you know after the boot camp that you went to before you were in a very bad spot you were in a very bad place like you wanted to go back to like to work it like a like as a post office man or something right so like why tell me why well well i had some very bad experience it's just like my grandma got cancer so i was focusing on like her more so that's one problem two is like just the experience of like the instructors like do you really like your in your motto of the school is we care about the students we want the students to succeed everything is about the student but once i got that certificate i don't even want to look at the certificate it's sitting right here next to me and every day i look at this and i was like i didn't learn anything i i can't i can't use this like i it can probably get me an interview but i can't get me a job so when i was sitting there i was i shoot at that time uh it was hard you know family problems stuff like that and then i was i to make my grandma proud she just all she ever wanted was just me have a job i'm not end up in jail i'm not she's very basic as long as i'm not in jail i can do whatever hell i want but she was like do something that makes you happy and i was like well at that time i'm gonna do something that makes you happier so i'm gonna apply for boeing i'm applying to be a i don't know work at postman i'm do i did amazon flex for a few months something just to get by pay bills i came across because of the stat the spotify clone i said that i'm gonna give clever programmer a try so i signed up for pwj and uh coffee called me that night night and i [ __ ] boy ever i was kind of embarrassing but the whole time he was talking about welcoming into pwg i was like i can't believe i'm talking to you right now i was just watching you eight hours a day just like last week and then you're actually calling my phone at 10 pm at night and the whole time he was like introducing pwg to me like we were happy to have you join a community this is a lifetime thing and i don't and the whole time i was just like i can't believe you're calling me he called i was like man this is probably something new but i was still in the mood of like i don't want to code no more like if if this is how coding is like if the school is like this imagine how the work is like like if i'm behind is everyone gonna be like nah he's done no we don't care we got his money already or we're only paying him let's turn them out let's just move on or find someone else to replace them so i just thought if it's doggy dog like that then i'd rather just work for a doggy dog company and just you know go on forward so uh and then you guys posted a reaction i said man i got a little bit money for amazon flex i'm just going to join it's it's what a weekend eight hours i'll just do amazon flex and like two or three o'clock in the morning i come home take a nap and i'll do this every single day and then introducing boot camp at the very end at first i was like man another boot camp do i when i want to get yelled at dude how how is this going to work i have no money i have like i thought i had yeah so this is definitely one of the things i'm interested in knowing it's like yeah you went to a boot camp already you invested in it you had a bad experience and you had very little money so what was going through your head when you decided to join this again another another yeah boot camp yeah so uh i had a phone call with daniel and daniel was like you sound like you really want to do this but i'm not gonna pass you on to frankie aka timmy until until uh you are dedicated to this and i really want to get good at coding i i liked it in high school no one really liked high school but then i wanted to do something different i wanted from further on i don't want to be like hey my kid's gonna be like oh he's just another mailman there's no no shout out to mailman's or people that work for boeing all this other stuff but i wanted to do something different where i can teach one day if i'm blessed to have a kid i can teach him how to program and learn the ins and out of the computers and stuff like that software because down the road tech is going to be the one biggest thing in the world so uh i had a talk with frankie i called him timmy at first because i thought that was hilarious you lied to me already and then uh right there and then there was that first obstacle is the money deposit down like for for you for a clever programmer to believe in you you also have to invest in yourself to become part of clever programmer so he gave me a week and uh i have a pride to not ask people for money because i don't know maybe that's just the asian thing but it shows kind of like weakness or something like that but uh i asked my sister and then i asked my brother my sister was like come on you just did a boot camp why are you doing another one like you know typical asian and then uh my brother didn't say anything at first he's a very to himself type of guy and then the next day let's say tuesday tuesday he was like hey do a down payment and pay the rest with amazon flex learn how to code do what you love and not have excuse that money is the reason why you couldn't do this so he works at construction sites so he makes a lot of money but he says that uh you're my brother so i have to take care of you regardless even if i hate you but but that's that's how brothers are he gave me and then uh the [ __ ] or timmy and then uh i said hey i have the money i'm ready to to uh 110 be in this boot camp join let's go and then you join the boot camp yeah yeah dude that is so amazing to have a brother like that because um but they're not like hey here's 5 000 bucks yeah to have somebody that believes so much in you you know to be able to give you the money or just just to have faith in you that is the biggest trust you know just like hey you know what you got this not a lot of people get that and so man you're lucky to have that and you know what and you took that and you were not afraid to ask and you actually invest in yourself and then that resulted in what you have right now and actually being able to pay back your your brother even more is that correct yeah yeah so now i'm curious right so you figured out a way to get into the boot camp figure out the payments you're like hey i'm gonna make it work i'm gonna invest in myself i'll join this but now i'm curious and people who are probably listening to this are curious how did you go from that to being able to get a job so like walk me through what happened you know kind of step by step yeah what made this different that allowed you to get there so at first i just thought hey i already did the boot camp this boot camp is just gonna be review of what i just missed i basically missed everything about javascript when i did this boot camp so uh they we miss what is that hexadecimal was the very first lesson i was like what is this what what do you mean zeros and ones i thought computers just you just type it in they know what the heck they're talking about i've been learning softwares of different companies so you just have to type in and then it saves itself i didn't know there's like a whole like different dimension basically to it so uh first week i hated it to be honest i hated it it was like nas i love you and everything you're the best i've ever had you put me in the hot seat every single single time and then that's what we do he's like you think you know what you're talking about okay so he picks on you and then it starts i wanted to test here right i'm here to test students right to make sure that you guys know what you're talking about because sometimes you don't know what you don't know yeah yeah and so that's when you realize what you don't know yeah so it was it was at the same time i was like man possibly different i'm just having cold sweat i'm like not really relaxed learning in class like this is different from any class i've ever been in so after a while it got fun and then it got really challenging but we were all excited and then i think i think that's part of this boot camp was how we all became like family within a week or two like there wasn't no you i'll be scared to message this person because i never met this person it was none of that my first thing when i first came in was my last boot camp every time i try to crack a joke i'm more like a class clown just to break the ice with like the group that i'm in just so it makes everyone welcome first because i'm i already feel like i'm okay but for other students or like people it's hard for them to break in and you know talk about themselves or like be comfortable talking to you vice versa so i made a joke about hexadecimals and it still lasts to this day and uh it i was afraid when i cracked that joke no one's going to laugh i was like oh it's going to be another boot camp but remember that we're gonna get tshirts that says 15. study group that we have uh i feel like i can hit up anyone in the group and be like hey i need help with this code and they're like yeah you got time to zoom like you'll get that from instructors you don't really get that from students you usually get like if you hit up as an instructor they'd be like yeah just give me some time i'll make time for you not for my last boot camp but this boot camp and then if you hit up a student like hey you have time to study they're like yeah just give me 10 15 minutes i might have you know and we're all over the world this could be morning was what one am and i hit him up and he was like yeah i can help you understand some codes he sent me some links and stuff like that the links don't make sense because i don't know like you know but he's there they were there and then every time we meet every tuesday thursday saturday sunday no everyone's you have a bad day or have a good day knowledge comes and makes us stretch makes us feel comfortable and then he we relax for the first five ten minutes of class and we go right right dance too every call yeah yeah right he's like i don't care twopiece combo to the head of coding like he knows we have a headache from it we know we were confused but it slowly slowly like hits like a hacker rank he introduced the hacker rank leak code and at first i looked at so my last problem was i figured out was i can't problem solve i can problem solve in real life but when it comes down to coding it's a lot different like you're giving instructions of how to stuff out and then you're giving a process of how do you break this down to write out so you do pseudo code and then the next step after that is to write the code so nas will do like a bunch of examples it can be try binary search it can be stack queue all that but he would write us out in pseudocode basically writing us the code we just have to figure out what the code is in javascript and then it's at first i was like oh god damn it javascript data structures this is different i didn't learn this from the last bootcamp they just told us how to make a app and they gave us the bootstrap all we have to do is write in the thing to make the buttons work that's it but now now dude can i just say i'm so proud of you for even being able to know what those are like try right binary saying it up i'm like holy moly like 90 people don't even know that right so but you've been able to know that understand it right you already already understand problem solving you already understand data structures which is the foundational programming right so like man proud of you for even just knowing that you know yeah and it's a singular reason why most people don't get jobs yeah because their foundations are weak yeah yeah yeah it's not that that so so let's just say data structures in life he's teaching us how to break things down in code and then figure out how to solve them but i often use that in real life that you can break stuff down and solve it see there's always a solution to something you just have to figure out how to do step by step so at first i was it was very difficult i had a hard time with hacker rank because there's so much there's so much problems there's there's easy medium advance and then nas introduced us to try hybrid i hated that the most the most but it was what you just decided it's combined so my goal is always to have what you learn here and how to learn here and to combine it right because it's not just about knowing like stacks or cues it's about learning okay how do i use both of them right together how do i use a tree together with a linked list or something something like right so you've been able to use all the different tools in your tool belt together that's what makes you a powerful developer right and so my goal is always to kind of mix and match with that yeah so let's get to the fun part where i decided to do internship at this certain company i'm not gonna say the name i'm very uh super sisters so until i see that piece of paper with the offer sheet i'm not even gonna mention the name i just told you guys but i'm not gonna mention it again because i'm very superstitious until i get that first direct deposit and then i'll brag all the day all day i want so uh about a month ago i was really having a hard time keeping up with class and i got offers from different places and before we could use how long were you in the boot camp so far just so we're aware january yeah march march two months into the program got it continued and then uh so i i was i'm a type of person where i'm very i have to know the code i have to be ready for this interview i have to be you know a hundred percent before i get to this interview i'm not going to do the interview jesse one of the instructors let's say ta part of clever program was like just do it the if you get hired you just got hired two months in the boot camp why why are you not applying like there's a bunch of people that apply 100 200 applications they don't get it you guys know what i'm talking about but i'm just saying like we like the mindset of just like being nervous and being scared is not going to be good for you because you'll never want to do it like before this i used to sell vacuums and i did amazon flex was like jobs i hated but if i can do that why can't i just you know apply for a job and then let's see if they like me just as a person or if i'm just you know critical thinker if i'm just a problem solver and they just have to reteach me how they code but as long as i get the foot in the door at least they're teaching they're like they're paying me to relearn how to code like them so i was like man forget it i'm just gonna apply 20 30 jobs but my main goal is this certain job since 2019 how the ceo is how the companies run it's in seattle i want to be part of this business i'll be intern i apply to be intern i'll do janitor work i'll bring people's coffee i'll get people's mail uh you want me clean your shoe i'll clean your shoe it's just i just want to be part of this company i don't care what i have to do i'll print paper all day if you want me to i'll walk around with you while you do sales or i'll grab hold your umbrella i don't care i just want to be part of this company so i i i've been to their meeting a lot of zoom calls i don't know what's going on in the business but it's because i'm a novice to the company so after a while they said hey you want to come in check out our facility as long as you get vaccines or stuff like that or you just come in with a covet negative results so i walked in for a few times and i i loved it their their their atmosphere is just like clever programmer they want you to learn they want they're all employees are treated equal there's just this mindset where it reminds me so much of clever program i was like this is even a plus i'm going to stay here for resolve stuff in seattle and then i decided to come down to california be part of clever programmer but that's the main goal and then um when i got the offer what was it yesterday um i got the offer yesterday i was sitting right here in the same exact spot and i looked at myself and i looked at uh the stack full mastery and i was like i want to tell people but the very first person i wanted to call was you nas but you never never went back i was busy man i'm sorry i was busy i called frankie didn't even pick up uh so at that time it was 11 a.m i joined jessie's uh react class that she hosted every tuesday and i told her and after i told her i was about to cry so i ran grabbed my dogs ran to the car and i cried and i listened to the radio i just drove around because i couldn't really believe it i just drove around for like 25 35 minutes qazi and uh and frankie called me around like two three o'clock pst time and they're like we heard we heard you got the job i was like yeah but there's something else that happened and i've been very quiet about this because nas taught us don't say it until you get it just get it first and then you can brag all you want so another position came up not really a position but my brotherinlaw runs a real estate and uh remodel houses and he resells the house and stuff like that but the thing for his clients is he doesn't have like he doesn't want to do a form to write out the parts he needs to remodel how much the price is so he decided to hire me to run to make his website with a database where he can see the pricing for each place that you pick up the like wood or like how many nails you need and stuff like that or if you want a new bathtub or like stuff like that so he said that he'll pay me two thousand dollars every two weeks are you sure you won't pay me that much like i'll take i'll do for free for what is he what is he going to be paying you for he's he's just outside trouble and not basically his assistant of like hey what did they buy put it together go get the parts and then i have a van or truck and i just have to drop off the part he's paying me two thousand dollars just to do a little bit of uh heavy lifting but control like maintenance of his uh website i am thinking i might not be able to do it myself so i am going to partner up with one of my old teammates have somebody else do the physical work you do the web development work but i'm fine it's a family business so i can do anything to help his business grow and uh so this is what does that mean for a year if it's like a year long that's like what 4 000 a month yeah it was 52 i think me just one second okay so 4 000 times 12 is forty eight thousand thousand dollars forty eight thousand so that's outside of so that's forty eight thousand a year doing this outside of your current seventy thousand dollar a year job that you're hoping you're gonna get right knock on wood yes but we're pretty sure that you're going to get it so that would if you had both of them that would be 70 000 a year plus the 48 000. so that's about 120 something thousand which is fantastic dude and that's your first job as a developer i mean that's freaking amazing yeah i didn't believe it when uh you guys couple months ago said stay with us there's a chance it's true initiative work hard learn how to code we know our [ __ ] baby we know our [ __ ] let's go yeah when we first came it was like everyone that did the boot camp or they're like a retreat that has 101 guidance from you guys as mentors minimum 52. i would never imagine my side would be times two of that i would never imagine out i'm happy with just the 70 but then when my brotherinlaw was like hey i see that you're doing good in this boot camp and you're always going to school like i'm always like i'm always texting like hey i'll be late i gotta finish this class i don't care if it's eight o'clock i'll go to home depot at nine o'clock i don't care but i have to do this now and then i can leave so he just showed like i'll be i'll be working to like with him you know 11 to midnight some sometimes he just sees like hey he this kid is doing school trying to get a fulltime job plus helping me on the side because you know he owes so he can't really lift that much and then he's just like instead of just now i said i'll do it for free just to show that hey it's a family business i'll take care of things we're doing this together it's family but the fact that he's he's like hey i'll pay you from just the property make some selling houses he'll just pay me every two weeks or just pay me once a month i don't mind my fourth house i don't i don't mind on top of it you get to learn right so it's always always a learning opportunity at the same time you get bbs can be paid to learn it doesn't get better but i want to ask you a question okay so what did you like you told me one thing it's one thing when i got on a call with you and i was like holy [ __ ] it's amazing and i was so happy for you right you tell me one thing in terms of what you learned from this bootcamp that really kind of really transformed your mindset when you went into the interview like what was it tell me dude this just just happened tuesday right just it just happened no last sunday sunday not bad i'm losing track of days now so sunday uh we had a student i'm not gonna say his name that was uh working at internship and then he was just describing how his internship was going nas was like be the ceo of wherever the hell you want to work you have to go in this show initiative you have to show that you can make more money for this company let's just say you're irreplaceable basically like you got to know what you're talking about you can show it's the action that matters you can show that you can actually do this so i walked into that interview i was like i'm not going to be nervous i'm not going to cross my legs i'm not going to show hand motion even though i had a button up and i had like boxers on but they couldn't really see the bottom of much they just have to see that professional and then like home body at the bottom very i was very outgoing i made a lot of jokes they see that i'm very outgoing person i made the room kind of like la it's it's always fun like we're here to have fun you're here to see how i am as a person this is how i am as a person i'll get stuff done i'm not going to complain or make excuses there's no excuses it's either you do it you don't do it there's there's no like i don't know what happened it's either you didn't do it or you didn't do it or you did it so the fact that nods just changed the mindset of just like making excuses blaming other people like you didn't do this the fact that i used to blame my old boot camp for how i didn't like coding was completely wrong it was wrong there's a bunch of developers that came out that boot camp it's just my experience was bad that's one out of like you know hundreds of kids that did that boot camp but instead of making that excuse i decided to join this boot camp and listen to what nas had to say liam had to say jesse had to say daniel every time he popped in here and there khazi coming up with like exercise throughout the class just do it and then the outcome would be dependent all the outcome will depend on you is you you do it or not if you don't don't do it developers let me let me okay like another interesting thing i want to ask you is in this boot camp what were some of the hardest moments for you oh that's interesting i bet there are a lot okay so uh this this this part um i thought it was pretty funny so we just got done with data structures right and uh liam kind of gave us a hint that we're gonna go to front end and i was like oh friend ends easy all i have to do is display flex that's all i have to do easy and then he gave us this porno dora app of like a timer yeah and i'm just sitting there i was like how are you supposed to make the timer go with the orange circular to like match up and then i was like not the front end was easy that is a lie so the fact that i underestimate front end front end is just as hard as backend because you have to be it's just as hard so i was like okay no more data structures thank god but there's no way this bootcamp is going to be easy i already knew that it's going to be my like there's no way that he takes a relaxing two weeks there's never a time that he takes like the easy two weeks so we decided to go back inside front end and then we did a couple of apps and front ends from uh what is that a frontend mentor and i was like oh he's just gonna try to get us back in front and learn a bit you know before we get inside react and the most challenging was switching from data structures where i thought i had a grasp on and then he decided to do a frontend uh spotify search bar with instead of using javascript he wants you to use link lin link bliss and then auto completely we did do that but he started out with api async away functions first and then he goes there's a better way to do with react so we bumped into react and i'm just like sitting back i sat back in class one time it's like this project isn't done this project isn't done that project isn't done but nas is number one thing is just do it you have to do it if you do it you get it you turn it in you get to look back once you add that to your portfolios you did this app but it's very very challenging very challenging it's very hard i'm not going to say you should think of this as boot camp where he's where nas is going to show you the demonstrations and then give you activities and then like tutor you how to code and then move on hell no he would legitimately call like he would finish her code and then he'd be like hmm who who do i think not paying attention or who's pretending to pay attention he calls us out on it which at first i was like oh this is fun but then he starts calling me out only sometimes i'm just like i got this i'm not nervous no more but then but here's the thing by calling you out right that made you more vigilant but also calling you out it made you more confident to go into the interview right yeah and i want to ask you a question for you what was it that they hired you for right like i didn't get that part from you like what was it only the behavioral questions like was it you cracking jokes and them just loving your vibe and they thought hey let's just bring this person on or what what made them say yes to bringing you on into their company and giving you a job offer well they gave me like different um let's say situations of how i would deal with you know problem solving so let's say for example if a software is messing up how would i go to solve it with no help let's say it's that you're basically i t but let's say no one's there to help you how would you solve this how would you go about it well one thing i learned from ingrid one of your past students is she wrote out a list of how she solved things is output input complexity pseudo code and then code so when you break that down into bits and pieces as you know how the software works you know how to debug it because once you learn how to debug it you should know how that software works figure out like what's the problem the first complexity is like what is wrong with it is there different ways to solve it and let's say pseudo code what are the steps of making this let's say problem solving of how did that error come up in the first place for let's say step one step two would be trying to figure out how to solve that problem and step three just solve it and there's a lot of stuff with they asked me how would i deal with like if i was stuck on something if i couldn't like if i was i couldn't learn it or something like that like a learning situation where everyone goes to i just told them hey i'm gonna take a walk with my dogs or when i get if i can't solve it that day i'm gonna i'm gonna take a break come back but i'm gonna think about it all all night that's all we think about is how to solve that problem all night and when i get back inside the next day i'm going to solve that or ask you any technical questions as well or no they asked me it was uh it was uh i think they asked me linked lists how to make a linked list how to catch api or how to fetch api um i think there's one more but i couldn't really did you solve any of them or did you fail in those questions when you were answering i know i failed um the second technical question because uh i was at that time it was an hour and a half in they asked me at the very end so i was like my energy is basically kind of gone i was just kind of like just thinking of ways of how to solve the problem and i wasn't like quiet about it i was like scratching my head or i was like rubbing my chin is winning or usually when i think but one thing about me is when i get nervous i make jokes by that time i knew it was not time to make junk this is serious so i was like at this time i'm just going to be like hey this is how i would solve it step by step by step but if something error pops up my resources would be books for google and at that time i'll use that to solve this problem going forward if there's people around me then i'll ask for help but this these are the first steps that i would do so go back to output input complexity pseudo code code and that's actually very important is like right when you go ahead and when you go to the interview it's not just that you've been able to solve the problem it's you being able to talk through it yeah right because that's what they're looking for is they're looking for people who can communicate who can talk through a problem even even for example if they can't fully write it or maybe they get it wrong but most importantly hey can you talk with someone can you work with a team to solve it yeah because you're going to be working with the team and they want to see how would this person communicate their lack of understanding or or their actual understanding to other people on the team and if they screw up will they take ownership or will they lie and make up [ __ ] and not take ownership over this so all of those things come into play so even when you're on zoom calls and now it's calling you out you working under that pressure answering him explaining is really helping you even for those interviews so yeah i love that like how your journey went it had you know it's like you have to learn coding and master that but on top of it you have to actually be confident take a chance in yourself right and actually apply for that internship even though mentally you were like hey i'm not going to apply so like jesse and nas pushed you to apply right so it's a lot of it is mindset work as well so that's incredible i mean you have this amazing job offer so tell me what does your life look like after going from this boot camp like what is it going to be looking like for you now what are you excited about i know the first few months is a lot of adjusting but i'm very lenient i'm i'm ready to learn as much as i can i'm at age where i i don't want to stop learning because we're like i already invested so much money on coding so there's there's more steps i want to learn how to play guitar i want to learn like a bunch of stuff more and stuff like that i don't want to learn how to dance from nas but that can wait down the road but it's just at this moment in time i wanted to i wanted to from all my past things is i always wanted a stable job i always wanted a job where they care about the employees the ceo is inspirational to me like i even messaged him right when i got the show like you're still inspiration to me i still want to clean your shoes but i'm just saying you know you just you gotta stay humble and hungry at the same time it's just the mindset of nah i don't know how it is going to be in the future because i haven't thought that far but the fact that i'm not nervous no more or the fact that i'm not like scared of like what what am i going to do in five ten years like am i gonna deliver mail am i gonna do amazon flex am i gonna learn how to become electrician so i can work for boeing for an airplane company like i don't have to do that no more the plan that i set out from 2009 to basically yesterday knock on wood is accomplished my now my next goal is to work at this place first no until i feel comfortable enough about my skills where maybe one day i'll go down to california and work with you guys and maybe maybe that's fantastic and we decided to open up like a school or something down there who knows no we are planning to do that that'll be amazing and we would love to talk about that so dude i'm so excited you're like just to flashback right you come into this program you're doing postmates making 20 000 a year you go through this now you're potentially looking at making between 70 000 to 128 000 a year that is absolutely freaking fantastic dude you should be really proud of yourself for putting in the work taking the chance on yourself being humble having that humility you know deflecting with humor but i think that helps you know people like you yeah for that right so yeah but it's okay i love that lightheartedness is freaking awesome dude so now this is amazing i'm excited would you recommend somebody who's thinking about joining full stack mastery boot camp and wants to be a part of it and they're thinking about it they're on the fence would you recommend this program to them no i have no hesitation and why tell them why man you just have to come in for me come on i just almost gave up coding the fact that the instructors care even if you go even they don't even you don't ever have to hit them up they hit you up through messages like hey how are you doing with this code like the effort that you guys put in to actually care about the students is number one the fact that if the students know that the instructors care they give their effort even more and the fact that you hear rumors about other boot camps like how come they never succeed like they probably do succeed just depending on the person but the fact that the rumors of like school were like gap and stuff like that and now if you just join this force mastery boot camp there's a better chance of you actually getting a job and they're gonna help you until you get a job they're going to help you with databases frontend backend mock interviews you can practice doing a capstone capstone basically there's some there's people coming in they want you to build their website you work as a team you talk to the client to build them a website and in the end or other what other places can you get all that within the time frame of you being part of the boot camp and it's very it's the only thing difficult i see is the time of how you how we are not so for bootcamp is usually like states or us but you guys are global global like you can help people from india vietnam russia as long as you're a part of this they they're they're able to get in without being 10 15 20 000 in depth and you guys have a payment plan that works out you guys have a team that'll communicate with us let's say you can afford it they'll work out a plan for you to even attend as long as you're committed as long as you put in time class is going to be fun it's going to be challenging it's going to be there's probably going to be some days where you don't want to go to class but the fact that if you feel like coding is hard once you join the coaching call every tuesday thursday saturday sunday you want to continue coding that's so great about nas is you feel so much of a headache you don't want to code no more and then when you get inside coaching call it just clicks instantly so where can you get that anywhere else school you like i don't want to go class i'll just skip class forget class even though i paid 20 000 for class sometimes you don't want to go for class right even if just this you want to be in class yeah that's absolutely amazing bro thank you so much for jumping on here and like sharing this with us yeah i'm so happy for you like seriously this is absolutely crazy to be able to do that in three months timeline i know you had some previous experience i understand but still like it's something that is one for the books and we don't give you a certification we just give you a job that's our focus i think i think i think i think you're pretty happy with that huh awesome that could happen later for sure um absolutely amazing well on thank you for being on here brother appreciate it i appreciate you so much man i'll probably clean his shoes and his tesla rims i got him go all right like it's crazy the fact that three months ago i don't know if i'm about to cry but i'm saying three months ago i was about to be you know something i didn't want to be just to make my grandma happy but now i can become something that i'm happy in and my grandpa my grandma didn't really care she just
