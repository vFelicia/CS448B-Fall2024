00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - what's up you guys how's it going it's
00:07 - david here from cleverprogrammer.com
00:10 - and we are live
00:13 - one of the most requested videos out
00:16 - there
00:16 - ever uh and i personally got a ton
00:20 - of messages regarding this topic what am
00:23 - i using
00:24 - what are we using uh what sorts of tools
00:28 - uh are we actually building our stuff
00:31 - with what are we
00:33 - using inside of clever programmer
00:36 - so that is exactly what i am going to be
00:39 - talking about
00:40 - today so with that said let's drop a
00:44 - comment where are you coming in
00:46 - where are you checking in welcome
00:47 - everybody to the stream
00:50 - and once again this is one of the most
00:53 - requested topics
00:55 - what are we using how are we building
00:57 - our stuff
00:59 - what is the tools that you should be
01:01 - investing into
01:02 - and not spending your money on
01:06 - dumb stuff what's up hello everybody
01:09 - hey planet hey wonder code what's up
01:12 - lean blue
01:14 - happy birthday for you tomorrow amazing
01:17 - it's amazing we are 40 people strong in
01:20 - one and a half minutes
01:22 - that's good and we are getting started
01:26 - in just a second so are you guys excited
01:30 - about this
01:31 - who is excited let me know in the chat
01:34 - what's up live to code hashtag ltc
01:37 - how's it going bro
01:42 - all right so before we actually gonna
01:45 - get go ahead and get started i amazing i
01:48 - see those likes
01:50 - going up keep it that way because the
01:53 - best way
01:54 - that you can become a developer is that
01:57 - you go ahead and smash that like button
01:59 - without question
02:00 - amazing super pumped awesome
02:04 - hey what's up how you guys doing we are
02:08 - at 42 people are the tools going to be
02:10 - very expensive or
02:12 - like on a budget good question i forgot
02:13 - to say that so
02:16 - some of them are going to be expensive
02:19 - some of them are going to be free
02:21 - we kind of try to balance between these
02:24 - and
02:24 - just give you guys an idea of what to be
02:27 - expected
02:28 - um i just wanted to keep it super clear
02:31 - we are trying to keep things uh as
02:35 - free and as cheap as possible because
02:37 - nobody wants to break their bank
02:39 - just to become a developer right there
02:41 - are like smarter investments and there
02:43 - are on smart investments so first thing
02:45 - first i want to clear this
02:46 - up uh the tools
02:51 - don't matter as much as the skills
02:54 - if you were to invest in your skills or
02:57 - in your tools
02:58 - or buying your new computer or buying a
03:00 - course
03:01 - obviously go with the course the reason
03:03 - being
03:04 - is that if you go with the new computer
03:08 - that's not gonna make you money obvious
03:09 - ultimately you're gonna be coding on
03:11 - that
03:11 - but that's not gonna make you that much
03:13 - cash so you always want to
03:15 - invest in for growth right all right
03:18 - uh
03:22 - amazing firebase is one of them probably
03:24 - that's a good catch
03:25 - but actually we're we are talking about
03:28 - stuff that support
03:30 - you while programming so with that said
03:33 - let's jump into
03:34 - the presentation wrong screen haha
03:38 - so first up
03:39 - [Music]
03:42 - uh i just want to welcome everybody to
03:44 - the ultimate buyer guide 2021
03:47 - what tools and tech i need to invest or
03:50 - spend money on okay invest
03:53 - in all right let's take a look at those
03:56 - comments okay
03:57 - amazing so yeah once again
04:00 - one of the most requested highest
04:02 - requested uh
04:03 - topics to talk about so yeah let's get
04:06 - started
04:08 - first thing first it is time to focus
04:12 - drop your phone aways it's going to be a
04:14 - fast short live
04:16 - amazing lean blue uh welcome to your
04:19 - first live
04:21 - and is learning ai easy it depends
04:24 - right we got uh content on that all
04:27 - right so time to focus
04:29 - put your phone away put the do not
04:30 - disturb on
04:32 - this is the time just give me these uh
04:35 - 30 minutes and we will be
04:36 - done with it all right so i'm gonna turn
04:40 - on my fancy pointer
04:42 - first thing that i get asked the most is
04:45 - a laptop
04:46 - or a desktop all right um
04:50 - this is kind of like how i think desktop
04:53 - is beating laptops by the way
04:56 - so my recommendation if you're going for
04:58 - a laptop you definitely want to check
05:01 - out
05:01 - the m1 macbook pro this is not sponsored
05:05 - by apple
05:05 - at all but i just kind of believe in
05:07 - their stuff
05:08 - especially with their new m1 chip it is
05:11 - the best that you can invest
05:13 - into and it's so so powerful
05:16 - obviously all our stuff we at cover
05:20 - programmer we use macbooks
05:21 - uh and imac so that's something to keep
05:25 - in mind
05:26 - this is an amazing stuff oh yeah
05:30 - yeah okay all right next up if you're
05:32 - buying
05:33 - a laptop be sure to invest in an
05:36 - external fan the reason being is that
05:38 - this these things are getting
05:40 - hot and you want to keep them cool
05:42 - otherwise they will throttle back on
05:44 - their performance
05:45 - this is probably one of the easiest one
05:47 - to get and the best one to get
05:49 - it has five different fans so yes that's
05:52 - uh
05:54 - that's something that you want to uh go
05:57 - for
05:58 - so you say but they're pretty expensive
06:00 - that is 100
06:01 - right however you are investing into it
06:04 - for the next
06:05 - five seven years and if you break it
06:07 - down
06:08 - it's it's not even that uh that
06:11 - expensive
06:12 - and because of macbooks uh apple's
06:15 - new stuff you will need a usb
06:18 - c doc bot then you can pretty much
06:20 - customize whatever you want to plug into
06:23 - your computer
06:24 - okay h prevents programming
06:27 - or sailor nope it doesn't at all we have
06:30 - students
06:31 - uh ranging from 11 years old all the way
06:35 - up to 50 plus all right let's go and
06:38 - let's jump back so my recommendation for
06:41 - a desktop uh is obviously going to be
06:45 - the
06:45 - m1 mac mini once again because of the
06:49 - amazing
06:50 - uh computer that they built together
06:54 - that
06:54 - powerhouse is just the best bang for
06:56 - your buck
06:57 - all right specifications you will need
07:00 - at least 16 gigs of ram
07:04 - if you are not buying an m1 mac
07:08 - uh in nowadays world for the m1 buyers
07:11 - eight gigabyte is going to be enough
07:13 - once you are firing up a react app is
07:15 - going to kill all your ram
07:17 - and going to use a ton of resources
07:19 - because you are
07:20 - doing some heavy coding stuff and all
07:23 - these
07:23 - development environments actually take
07:26 - up a ton of resource
07:28 - um take up a ton
07:31 - of your computer
07:35 - uh yeah okay
07:38 - next up you definitely want to protect
07:41 - your eyes i'm not wearing it at this
07:43 - moment but
07:44 - i have a blue light glass
07:47 - if you become a student of ours i may
07:50 - show it how i look like in glasses but
07:54 - you definitely want to invest in a blue
07:56 - light glass it just uh
07:58 - keeps the blue light uh out of your eyes
08:01 - and you will be able to
08:04 - sleep better at night and all these kind
08:05 - of stuff so make sure to protect your
08:07 - eyes
08:08 - you are working with screens all around
08:10 - the place so that's something to keep
08:12 - an eye on pun intended
08:15 - ultra wide monitor the ultrawide monitor
08:19 - is one of the best investments uh that
08:22 - you can
08:23 - probably make and one of the best
08:25 - inventions that people made
08:28 - because you can get so many things done
08:30 - just by having an ultra wide
08:32 - and even a second screen so if you're if
08:35 - you're lower on budget you definitely
08:36 - want to get
08:37 - at least two three monitors but if
08:40 - if you can go for a bigger ultrawide
08:43 - monitor go for it
08:44 - it pays for itself the amount of
08:47 - productivity that you will be able
08:49 - that you will be blessed with just by
08:51 - having so many stuff
08:52 - open and being able to
08:56 - go all around the place just with a
08:58 - click
08:59 - it's going to pay for itself in terms of
09:04 - price all right you don't want to
09:07 - jeep out on your back but your back is
09:10 - going to get
09:11 - go is the number one thing your spines
09:14 - need to be
09:15 - aligned in place what kazi uses in his
09:19 - studio is this
09:20 - gt or racing chair this is probably a
09:24 - higher end something
09:26 - uh you can get this for a few hundred
09:29 - dollars but
09:30 - this is the ultimate thing you should be
09:33 - doing if you are just
09:34 - starting out or you're kind of like at
09:37 - the beginning
09:38 - you probably want to go with something
09:39 - like this make sure to have
09:41 - a head rest like i do make sure to have
09:44 - proper
09:45 - backrest like i like this one has lumbar
09:48 - support
09:49 - is super important and you definitely
09:51 - want to have
09:52 - these arms over here all right
09:56 - armrests over here okay nice chair
09:59 - super important don't cheap out on that
10:02 - because you will be sitting in this
10:03 - thing
10:04 - a lot so that's something to keep an eye
10:07 - on
10:07 - all right next up standing desks
10:11 - it is uh a little less important than
10:14 - having a good chair
10:16 - but having a standing desk has changed
10:19 - my life and so many people out there
10:23 - so a standing desk is actually something
10:25 - that you can go ahead press the button
10:27 - and it's just gonna raise up
10:28 - that way you can be standing and working
10:31 - once again for your back for your legs
10:34 - and you can just move around
10:36 - have a uh little bit of movement all the
10:38 - way
10:39 - so that's something once again and you
10:42 - and even if you have an apple watch it
10:44 - will
10:44 - actually warn you every single hour
10:47 - that you should be jumping around a
10:49 - little just to get your bloodstream
10:52 - uh flowing around so that's once again
10:55 - important thing
10:55 - don't cheap out on that
10:59 - let's get to the softwares because
11:00 - that's literally the most requested
11:03 - stuff
11:04 - uh that you were asking me about so
11:07 - softwares that that will level
11:10 - up your game
11:13 - prototyping tools sketch this one
11:16 - is a paid software it's i think uh
11:20 - there is student pricing available it i
11:23 - think they
11:24 - drop it off 40 i got it with student
11:27 - pricing this is an amazing tool
11:30 - i'm literally not using anything else
11:31 - for prototyping
11:33 - whenever i build some custom stuff i
11:35 - always go
11:36 - into sketch first and then just sketch
11:38 - it out
11:39 - pun intended once again figma
11:42 - free version of sketch
11:46 - knows almost everything as sketch
11:49 - but it's free it's an amazing tool
11:53 - and you can you can pretty much do
11:56 - almost ever anything
11:57 - uh that you can do with sketch however
11:59 - sketch has a little more plugins and
12:02 - just
12:03 - those little details that make a
12:05 - software different
12:07 - all right and adobe xd once again a
12:12 - freemium software i think i honestly i
12:15 - hate adobe
12:16 - stuff but uh some people in the team and
12:19 - a lot of my developer
12:21 - uh peers that i know use
12:24 - adobe xd so that's once again that
12:26 - something you can
12:28 - use and actually the more of this you're
12:30 - familiar with
12:31 - the more kinds of software that you can
12:33 - build and and the more kinds of designs
12:36 - and prototypes that you can create
12:38 - and actually the more kinds of
12:41 - clients you are going to be compatible
12:43 - with because they might as well just
12:45 - send you a photoshop file and then
12:47 - you cannot open them in either sketch
12:49 - nor figma
12:50 - you will need to use adobe xd
12:54 - terminal this is the fanciest stuff
12:57 - uh you guys are interested in hold on a
13:00 - sec
13:02 - uh let me go ahead and open up my
13:04 - terminal
13:05 - real quick so this is the thing that i
13:08 - actually use
13:09 - and we here at clever programmer use if
13:12 - i i can just go into my local
13:14 - uh git version control and that that's
13:18 - actually
13:18 - where all my folders are and i can just
13:21 - list all these stuff and it looks super
13:23 - nice
13:24 - and if i were to go into uh the twitch
13:26 - clone say
13:28 - which we actually built on this channel
13:30 - and
13:31 - let's say what we have in here so once
13:33 - again twitch clone
13:35 - uh come on
13:39 - jesus okay i have some nested stuff in
13:43 - there
13:45 - bang it actually shows the git version
13:48 - control over here
13:50 - uh this was actually initialized before
13:52 - github
13:53 - uh and all these git version control
13:55 - software is refined that the
13:57 - uh the default branch is not going to be
14:00 - master anymore and
14:02 - calling it master is discontinued now we
14:04 - are calling it main but this was
14:06 - uh actually initialized before that time
14:09 - so
14:09 - yep and that's something to uh look out
14:12 - to plus
14:13 - it will make you super cool and just
14:16 - popping this up in a cafe will just make
14:19 - you look so much more professional
14:21 - and will honestly this was the software
14:24 - that weighed me made me want to use
14:26 - terminal
14:26 - all right next up i term 2. i personally
14:29 - don't use this
14:30 - but uh i i just use the built in
14:33 - uh mac software but i haven't
14:37 - uh actually tested this out yet but i am
14:40 - planning to transition over to item 2
14:42 - because it actually
14:44 - just takes everything to another level
14:46 - the oh my zsh
14:48 - is uh amazing by itself and it just can
14:50 - be put into whichever
14:53 - terminal you're already using
14:56 - but but item just takes everything to
14:58 - another level
15:00 - and git version control definitely
15:03 - something
15:04 - i'm not even sure why it's in the
15:05 - terminal whatever it's in
15:08 - it's over here anyways get version
15:10 - control you don't want to miss out on
15:12 - productivity apps notion of
15:15 - hold on notion notion is the
15:19 - number one productivity app that you
15:22 - will use
15:23 - this is literally my notion that i use
15:27 - and this is actually uh the youtube
15:30 - report this is pretty much
15:31 - those videos that i uh did
15:36 - yesterday and two days before that i
15:39 - think
15:40 - and those are given to our professional
15:43 - editor
15:44 - kyle who will actually just chop it up
15:46 - and i will be uploading them
15:48 - i think he even actually finished those
15:50 - so it's just me
15:51 - who needs to upload it anyways
15:55 - notion 100 recommended uh
15:58 - it is free once again it is free by the
16:01 - way all the terminal stuff
16:02 - is free free for free 3.99
16:06 - and you can actually go ahead grab them
16:09 - download them
16:10 - and just be more productive because at
16:12 - the end of the day you will save time
16:13 - and the more time you save the more time
16:16 - you will have to take on
16:17 - more projects which will ultimately make
16:19 - you more money
16:22 - again uh productivity app another one
16:26 - is alfred it is actually on my main
16:29 - screen now but
16:30 - if you know this thing
16:34 - this one on steroids i can search up my
16:37 - contacts i can search up
16:39 - files on my machine makes it so much
16:42 - faster
16:42 - and you can just build so uh workflows
16:45 - in there so i just
16:46 - type in a comment and it will just
16:48 - execute it so basically when i turn on
16:50 - my computer i just type in
16:52 - alfred started or something like that
16:54 - and it would just open up all my used
16:56 - application that i already use and
16:58 - integrated with
16:58 - a few more applications and everything
17:01 - is just going to be in place
17:02 - just how i left it the night before and
17:05 - i actually turned off my computer
17:08 - because of that
17:10 - dropler dropper is your number one
17:14 - uh screenshot application i wanted to
17:18 - say it so fast
17:19 - so if i hold down option shift and three
17:23 - and then just highlight this area it
17:25 - will open
17:27 - this window up i can mark up
17:30 - super fast i think it's actually uh
17:33 - paid by the way and i can point and
17:36 - click around this
17:37 - screenshot now why is this important you
17:39 - might be asking because it
17:41 - actually a screen shot up like who
17:42 - cannot annotate a screenshot right
17:45 - makes you fast and actually it will
17:48 - generate a link for you that you can
17:50 - share towards your clients this is
17:52 - something that we use inside of
17:54 - cleverprogrammer
17:55 - and makes us work 10x
17:58 - if not more faster 10x faster just
18:02 - because we
18:03 - take screenshots so much faster and we
18:05 - just point around and
18:06 - everybody knows where to look and even
18:09 - on a webpage or something that i have
18:12 - never ever
18:13 - seen before i can just look around just
18:16 - because i have the arrows and
18:18 - all those annotations in there
18:21 - all right loom same thing
18:25 - but with video uh only
18:28 - drawback you cannot annotate but anyways
18:32 - super fast and it will actually upload
18:34 - while you are recording it will record
18:36 - your screen
18:36 - yourself and you can by the way turn it
18:39 - off if you want don't want to record
18:40 - yourself
18:42 - but we'll make your life so much faster
18:44 - because while you're recording it is
18:46 - actually
18:46 - uploading so super fast again and it
18:49 - will just give you
18:50 - a link that you can share with your
18:52 - clients
18:54 - now coming back to the first topic that
18:56 - we had and this is the end
18:59 - do you actually need to upgrade if you
19:02 - are have a good enough stuff

Cleaned transcript:

what's up you guys how's it going it's david here from cleverprogrammer.com and we are live one of the most requested videos out there ever uh and i personally got a ton of messages regarding this topic what am i using what are we using uh what sorts of tools uh are we actually building our stuff with what are we using inside of clever programmer so that is exactly what i am going to be talking about today so with that said let's drop a comment where are you coming in where are you checking in welcome everybody to the stream and once again this is one of the most requested topics what are we using how are we building our stuff what is the tools that you should be investing into and not spending your money on dumb stuff what's up hello everybody hey planet hey wonder code what's up lean blue happy birthday for you tomorrow amazing it's amazing we are 40 people strong in one and a half minutes that's good and we are getting started in just a second so are you guys excited about this who is excited let me know in the chat what's up live to code hashtag ltc how's it going bro all right so before we actually gonna get go ahead and get started i amazing i see those likes going up keep it that way because the best way that you can become a developer is that you go ahead and smash that like button without question amazing super pumped awesome hey what's up how you guys doing we are at 42 people are the tools going to be very expensive or like on a budget good question i forgot to say that so some of them are going to be expensive some of them are going to be free we kind of try to balance between these and just give you guys an idea of what to be expected um i just wanted to keep it super clear we are trying to keep things uh as free and as cheap as possible because nobody wants to break their bank just to become a developer right there are like smarter investments and there are on smart investments so first thing first i want to clear this up uh the tools don't matter as much as the skills if you were to invest in your skills or in your tools or buying your new computer or buying a course obviously go with the course the reason being is that if you go with the new computer that's not gonna make you money obvious ultimately you're gonna be coding on that but that's not gonna make you that much cash so you always want to invest in for growth right all right uh amazing firebase is one of them probably that's a good catch but actually we're we are talking about stuff that support you while programming so with that said let's jump into the presentation wrong screen haha so first up uh i just want to welcome everybody to the ultimate buyer guide 2021 what tools and tech i need to invest or spend money on okay invest in all right let's take a look at those comments okay amazing so yeah once again one of the most requested highest requested uh topics to talk about so yeah let's get started first thing first it is time to focus drop your phone aways it's going to be a fast short live amazing lean blue uh welcome to your first live and is learning ai easy it depends right we got uh content on that all right so time to focus put your phone away put the do not disturb on this is the time just give me these uh 30 minutes and we will be done with it all right so i'm gonna turn on my fancy pointer first thing that i get asked the most is a laptop or a desktop all right um this is kind of like how i think desktop is beating laptops by the way so my recommendation if you're going for a laptop you definitely want to check out the m1 macbook pro this is not sponsored by apple at all but i just kind of believe in their stuff especially with their new m1 chip it is the best that you can invest into and it's so so powerful obviously all our stuff we at cover programmer we use macbooks uh and imac so that's something to keep in mind this is an amazing stuff oh yeah yeah okay all right next up if you're buying a laptop be sure to invest in an external fan the reason being is that this these things are getting hot and you want to keep them cool otherwise they will throttle back on their performance this is probably one of the easiest one to get and the best one to get it has five different fans so yes that's uh that's something that you want to uh go for so you say but they're pretty expensive that is 100 right however you are investing into it for the next five seven years and if you break it down it's it's not even that uh that expensive and because of macbooks uh apple's new stuff you will need a usb c doc bot then you can pretty much customize whatever you want to plug into your computer okay h prevents programming or sailor nope it doesn't at all we have students uh ranging from 11 years old all the way up to 50 plus all right let's go and let's jump back so my recommendation for a desktop uh is obviously going to be the m1 mac mini once again because of the amazing uh computer that they built together that powerhouse is just the best bang for your buck all right specifications you will need at least 16 gigs of ram if you are not buying an m1 mac uh in nowadays world for the m1 buyers eight gigabyte is going to be enough once you are firing up a react app is going to kill all your ram and going to use a ton of resources because you are doing some heavy coding stuff and all these development environments actually take up a ton of resource um take up a ton of your computer uh yeah okay next up you definitely want to protect your eyes i'm not wearing it at this moment but i have a blue light glass if you become a student of ours i may show it how i look like in glasses but you definitely want to invest in a blue light glass it just uh keeps the blue light uh out of your eyes and you will be able to sleep better at night and all these kind of stuff so make sure to protect your eyes you are working with screens all around the place so that's something to keep an eye on pun intended ultra wide monitor the ultrawide monitor is one of the best investments uh that you can probably make and one of the best inventions that people made because you can get so many things done just by having an ultra wide and even a second screen so if you're if you're lower on budget you definitely want to get at least two three monitors but if if you can go for a bigger ultrawide monitor go for it it pays for itself the amount of productivity that you will be able that you will be blessed with just by having so many stuff open and being able to go all around the place just with a click it's going to pay for itself in terms of price all right you don't want to jeep out on your back but your back is going to get go is the number one thing your spines need to be aligned in place what kazi uses in his studio is this gt or racing chair this is probably a higher end something uh you can get this for a few hundred dollars but this is the ultimate thing you should be doing if you are just starting out or you're kind of like at the beginning you probably want to go with something like this make sure to have a head rest like i do make sure to have proper backrest like i like this one has lumbar support is super important and you definitely want to have these arms over here all right armrests over here okay nice chair super important don't cheap out on that because you will be sitting in this thing a lot so that's something to keep an eye on all right next up standing desks it is uh a little less important than having a good chair but having a standing desk has changed my life and so many people out there so a standing desk is actually something that you can go ahead press the button and it's just gonna raise up that way you can be standing and working once again for your back for your legs and you can just move around have a uh little bit of movement all the way so that's something once again and you and even if you have an apple watch it will actually warn you every single hour that you should be jumping around a little just to get your bloodstream uh flowing around so that's once again important thing don't cheap out on that let's get to the softwares because that's literally the most requested stuff uh that you were asking me about so softwares that that will level up your game prototyping tools sketch this one is a paid software it's i think uh there is student pricing available it i think they drop it off 40 i got it with student pricing this is an amazing tool i'm literally not using anything else for prototyping whenever i build some custom stuff i always go into sketch first and then just sketch it out pun intended once again figma free version of sketch knows almost everything as sketch but it's free it's an amazing tool and you can you can pretty much do almost ever anything uh that you can do with sketch however sketch has a little more plugins and just those little details that make a software different all right and adobe xd once again a freemium software i think i honestly i hate adobe stuff but uh some people in the team and a lot of my developer uh peers that i know use adobe xd so that's once again that something you can use and actually the more of this you're familiar with the more kinds of software that you can build and and the more kinds of designs and prototypes that you can create and actually the more kinds of clients you are going to be compatible with because they might as well just send you a photoshop file and then you cannot open them in either sketch nor figma you will need to use adobe xd terminal this is the fanciest stuff uh you guys are interested in hold on a sec uh let me go ahead and open up my terminal real quick so this is the thing that i actually use and we here at clever programmer use if i i can just go into my local uh git version control and that that's actually where all my folders are and i can just list all these stuff and it looks super nice and if i were to go into uh the twitch clone say which we actually built on this channel and let's say what we have in here so once again twitch clone uh come on jesus okay i have some nested stuff in there bang it actually shows the git version control over here uh this was actually initialized before github uh and all these git version control software is refined that the uh the default branch is not going to be master anymore and calling it master is discontinued now we are calling it main but this was uh actually initialized before that time so yep and that's something to uh look out to plus it will make you super cool and just popping this up in a cafe will just make you look so much more professional and will honestly this was the software that weighed me made me want to use terminal all right next up i term 2. i personally don't use this but uh i i just use the built in uh mac software but i haven't uh actually tested this out yet but i am planning to transition over to item 2 because it actually just takes everything to another level the oh my zsh is uh amazing by itself and it just can be put into whichever terminal you're already using but but item just takes everything to another level and git version control definitely something i'm not even sure why it's in the terminal whatever it's in it's over here anyways get version control you don't want to miss out on productivity apps notion of hold on notion notion is the number one productivity app that you will use this is literally my notion that i use and this is actually uh the youtube report this is pretty much those videos that i uh did yesterday and two days before that i think and those are given to our professional editor kyle who will actually just chop it up and i will be uploading them i think he even actually finished those so it's just me who needs to upload it anyways notion 100 recommended uh it is free once again it is free by the way all the terminal stuff is free free for free 3.99 and you can actually go ahead grab them download them and just be more productive because at the end of the day you will save time and the more time you save the more time you will have to take on more projects which will ultimately make you more money again uh productivity app another one is alfred it is actually on my main screen now but if you know this thing this one on steroids i can search up my contacts i can search up files on my machine makes it so much faster and you can just build so uh workflows in there so i just type in a comment and it will just execute it so basically when i turn on my computer i just type in alfred started or something like that and it would just open up all my used application that i already use and integrated with a few more applications and everything is just going to be in place just how i left it the night before and i actually turned off my computer because of that dropler dropper is your number one uh screenshot application i wanted to say it so fast so if i hold down option shift and three and then just highlight this area it will open this window up i can mark up super fast i think it's actually uh paid by the way and i can point and click around this screenshot now why is this important you might be asking because it actually a screen shot up like who cannot annotate a screenshot right makes you fast and actually it will generate a link for you that you can share towards your clients this is something that we use inside of cleverprogrammer and makes us work 10x if not more faster 10x faster just because we take screenshots so much faster and we just point around and everybody knows where to look and even on a webpage or something that i have never ever seen before i can just look around just because i have the arrows and all those annotations in there all right loom same thing but with video uh only drawback you cannot annotate but anyways super fast and it will actually upload while you are recording it will record your screen yourself and you can by the way turn it off if you want don't want to record yourself but we'll make your life so much faster because while you're recording it is actually uploading so super fast again and it will just give you a link that you can share with your clients now coming back to the first topic that we had and this is the end do you actually need to upgrade if you are have a good enough stuff that is just working the answer is no where do you need to upgrade your skill set something that you can actually turn into money something that will give you the financial and if independence that you are entitled to and that you deserve that's why we built profit with javascript the number one course on the internet that will give give you the ability to become an amazing freelance or fulltime developer take our students who actually landed jobs this guy just landed their job at cars.com as a frontend developer today this message literally was sent to us today we have bradfield from south africa who is now working as a fulltime developer big thanks to ray and nas and kazi i mean it speaks for itself we have ingrid who has been tutoring on weizen for several months and is making good cash and we have calvin who is now uh he is actually living in nigeria when he is now as uh an anal a technology analyst intern programmer for the summer of 2021 in dublin ireland guys this works that's it that's what i'm gonna say if you want to upgrade upgrade your skill set upgrade the community that is surrounds you and yeah that's it that's the end thank you so much for joining uh i hope i could give you guys as much value as possible by the way if you're interested in joining profitable javascript link down below in the description make sure to drop whatever you are interested in because as you can see we deliver on what you guys ask link down below in the description everything is linked down we got a free training down there so make sure to check everything out and with that said thank you so much for joining this is david from cleverprogrammer.com and i'll see you in the next video
