01:35 - richie give him that disclaimer
01:39 - awesome so the disclaimer is this eight
01:42 - questions
01:42 - are for general interviews like you can
01:45 - use that for any interview
01:47 - but we have used example for the answers
01:49 - as uh for software developers
01:51 - because they are rockstars and dick to
01:54 - go through a lot of trouble what do you
01:55 - say daniel
01:56 - yeah no no this is great because the
01:58 - thing is there's always a lot of general
02:00 - questions that get repurposed for a lot
02:01 - of things because the interviewers might
02:03 - get a little lazy like hey what other
02:04 - type of interview questions are there
02:06 - so they will be very helpful in your
02:08 - interviews potentially
02:09 - potentially
02:12 - yep so first of all let's start with why
02:15 - answering interview questions properly
02:17 - is super important like so drop down in
02:20 - the comments guys
02:22 - that what do you think are the reasons
02:24 - that why answering the proper questions
02:26 - are
02:27 - necessary so go ahead and danielle just
02:30 - gave you a hint yeah yeah sorry
02:32 - i'll wait a little next time but go
02:34 - ahead drop the knowledge on them richie
02:38 - yeah so i think the first reason why do
02:41 - you want to answer proper questions
02:43 - is proper answers will increase your
02:46 - chance by 90
02:47 - and i think that is one of the most
02:49 - important thing
02:50 - that you guys want to do because uh you
02:53 - might apply for 300 400 jobs and you can
02:55 - definitely learn 10 uh definitely learn
02:58 - 10 interviews maybe
02:59 - but when you land those interviews what
03:01 - matters is that there are going to be
03:03 - competitors
03:04 - for you and to be that competitors
03:06 - answering proper
03:08 - uh answering that questions properly
03:10 - matters a lot and it will
03:11 - increase your chance 90 percent if you
03:13 - do that properly
03:15 - exactly so what happens is these
03:17 - companies have a job
03:19 - opening and they know the type of person
03:21 - that they want to work
03:22 - on that specific technology or with that
03:25 - specific team
03:26 - so they try to tailor those questions to
03:28 - see if you are
03:29 - that specific person so by properly
03:32 - positioning yourself
03:33 - and answering those questions correctly
03:35 - you can show whether you
03:37 - are that type of person but if you kind
03:38 - of just throw some weird answers and
03:40 - they're not the right answers
03:42 - then you might show that you're not a
03:43 - good fit which is why
03:45 - we want to show you these things so that
03:46 - you make sure we make sure
03:48 - you're giving the right answers so
03:50 - what's the second reason
03:53 - awesome and before we talk about the
03:55 - second reasons guy
03:56 - if you guys if you want to know about a
03:58 - real uh
04:01 - free training on how to build the whole
04:03 - netflix clone
04:04 - the link is in the description make sure
04:06 - to subscribe to that
04:07 - it's gonna be a very useful clone and
04:09 - you can put that project on your resume

04:19 - and get that free training for you and
04:21 - have that resume have that project on
04:23 - your resume
04:24 - awesome so let's talk about the number
04:27 - two
04:27 - reasons so second reason is proper
04:30 - answer will prove you have strong skills
04:32 - basically most important in north
04:34 - america probably all over the world
04:36 - but most important in north america
04:38 - people see
04:39 - people focuses a lot on soft skills as
04:41 - they focuses on technical skills
04:43 - because obviously they wants to know
04:45 - that if you are a good team member or
04:47 - not
04:47 - obviously they don't wanna they don't
04:49 - want someone who is not a good team
04:50 - player
04:51 - right daniel so i think that is one of
04:53 - the most important things soft skills
04:54 - are as much necessary as you
04:56 - as much as technical skills look put
04:59 - very simply
05:00 - put yourselves in their shoes if you're
05:02 - trying to hire someone for a position
05:04 - do you want it to be someone who's hard
05:06 - to work with do you want to be someone
05:08 - who doesn't communicate
05:09 - his ideas right do you want to be
05:11 - someone who gets angry
05:12 - if you don't understand what he's saying
05:14 - right it's like you don't want to be
05:16 - working with someone who's not fun to
05:18 - work with so by having these strong
05:20 - soft skills you become that person
05:22 - that's fun to work with easy to work
05:24 - with
05:24 - if anything people feel excited and
05:26 - energized you have a lot of
05:28 - positive energy and that all happens
05:30 - through your
05:31 - that your transfer and your development
05:33 - of soft skills
05:37 - amazing danielle very well said i think
05:40 - so let's go forward and let's move to
05:42 - what are the types of interviews so uh
05:45 - guys drop it in the comments
05:47 - what do you think that what are the
05:48 - types of interviews that uh
05:50 - hiring managers uh usually uh takes
05:54 - so uh i think let's uh talk about the
05:56 - first interview
06:00 - daniel oh yeah yep yeah so go ahead
06:03 - [Music]
06:04 - yeah so i think the first and i think uh
06:06 - the
06:07 - this this is gonna be the first
06:08 - interview and there are gonna be like
06:10 - some sets of interview but i think that
06:12 - this is gonna be the first interview
06:13 - that's gonna be a general and soft
06:15 - skills interview
06:16 - where their goal is to learn about your
06:18 - attitude and mindset before they go
06:20 - through the technical interview
06:22 - dave wants to know that if you are a
06:24 - good fit for the team as we said and the
06:26 - goal for that interview is going to be
06:28 - to learn about your attitude and mindset
06:29 - so they are going to be asking you a
06:30 - couple of questions in that way they can
06:32 - know about your mindset
06:34 - and the way you answer those questions
06:35 - matters a lot because that's going to
06:37 - prove that you are way more smarter than
06:40 - other 10 people
06:41 - who are who they are going to be
06:42 - interviewing right daniel so that is
06:44 - what a general and a soft skill
06:46 - interview is exactly and this is also
06:47 - sometimes called the behavioral
06:49 - interview and again they just want to
06:52 - see
06:52 - if you have the right mindset the right
06:54 - attitude if you're going to be fun to
06:56 - work with
06:57 - if you can connect with them on a human
06:59 - to human level
07:00 - and if you're able to do all those
07:02 - things then they're gonna be like man
07:03 - like
07:04 - now if he just has this second part
07:06 - which is gonna be the second
07:07 - part of the interview then he would be
07:09 - an awesome and amazing
07:11 - fit so what exactly is that second part
07:14 - richie
07:16 - so the second thing is the technical
07:18 - interview now the
07:19 - goal for that interview is to learn
07:21 - about your technical ability
07:24 - though if let's say like if you apply
07:25 - for a front-end position that requires a
07:27 - reac js developer
07:28 - the goal for this interview would be
07:30 - they are going to be asking you to show
07:31 - your code
07:32 - maybe they are just going to give you
07:33 - some example to solve this problem
07:34 - they're going to ask you questions like
07:36 - states and props and react so
07:38 - that's going to be a technical interview
07:39 - but today here
07:41 - we are going to be focusing on the soft
07:43 - skills into the general interview
07:45 - that's gonna be the first interview that
07:47 - you're gonna be getting when you apply
07:48 - for
07:49 - jobs exactly exactly so like how richie
07:52 - said it's
07:52 - if you get that first part which we'll
07:55 - be going over
07:56 - today then there you go okay he's
07:58 - awesome he's great to work with he or
07:59 - she is great to work with
08:01 - but now do they have the technical
08:03 - ability can they actually develop
08:05 - software and that's what this is but
08:07 - like how richie said today we're gonna
08:09 - dive
08:09 - deep into the first part which is the
08:11 - behavioral
08:12 - type interviews and we're going to give
08:14 - you every single tip that you need
08:16 - questions that you might get asked and
08:18 - how to answer them
08:19 - so what you want to make sure is that in
08:21 - this presentation
08:23 - you want to take screenshots and you
08:25 - want to take notes because richie laid
08:27 - out
08:27 - some amazing examples that if i were to
08:30 - go back to my interviews
08:32 - i would definitely take notes on these i
08:34 - would take screenshots i would probably
08:36 - just
08:36 - have those in my head so here's a little
08:38 - trick about behavioral interviews i know
08:40 - i'm talking for a long
08:41 - itchy but a little tip about behavioral
08:43 - interviews is
08:44 - they have patterns they have trends it's
08:47 - not like the technical interview where
08:48 - it's always gonna be a different
08:50 - question it's
08:50 - these might be the same question or the
08:52 - same type of question so
08:54 - if you prepare for these before the
08:56 - interview when they ask you a question
08:58 - you might already know exactly what you
09:01 - want to share with them
09:03 - what story what experience that shows a
09:05 - specific attribute about yourself
09:07 - so richie let's go ahead and dive deep
09:10 - into some of these what do you say yes
09:13 - yeah for sure and most important thing
09:15 - is that you guys
09:17 - take screenshot because we have laid out
09:19 - the exact
09:20 - answer format that you can use in your
09:23 - interview
09:23 - all you need to do is like include your
09:25 - roles and your positions and your note
09:28 - and your name and also make sure to take
09:30 - notes because
09:31 - being and being ready for an interview
09:33 - can get you a very good job
09:34 - so let's get started without wasting any
09:36 - time daniel so
09:38 - guys you have to ask him richie you
09:40 - think they're ready
09:42 - yeah guys so if you are ready drop down
09:44 - in the comments if you're already it's
09:46 - gonna be one of the more
09:47 - personally for me it's gonna be one of
09:49 - the most exciting live stream as a lot
09:50 - of people wants to know
09:52 - how they can answer those common
09:54 - questions and it's like the questions
09:55 - are going to be like
09:56 - tell us something about yourself and
09:58 - that's where a lot of people bluff
10:00 - they don't know what to tell right so
10:02 - that those kind of things
10:03 - that we are going to be talking about so
10:05 - question one is gonna be
10:07 - tell us something about yourself and
10:09 - this is where
10:10 - a lot of people tend to believe even me
10:12 - i have went through some interest and
10:13 - when
10:13 - in the beginning when they used to ask
10:15 - me like tell us something i'm like i
10:16 - used to bluff that oh okay i'm rishi and
10:18 - stuff like that
10:19 - but let's see that what most people
10:22 - answer is
10:23 - okay so what's the wrong answer then
10:26 - rich well richie would show up
10:27 - hey i'm richie i'm a full stack
10:29 - developer i live in canada i'm trying to
10:32 - imitate ritchie i was born in india and
10:34 - i love playing sports
10:35 - and reading books now richie why do we
10:38 - feel that this is the wrong
10:40 - type of answer exactly i think
10:43 - when i started i used to answer this
10:45 - question just like this
10:47 - but this is a wrong wrong question if
10:50 - you answer like this
10:51 - the chances are that you are not gonna
10:53 - get higher now the things
10:54 - that you could avoid in this question is
10:57 - do
10:58 - not ever interfere your personal life
11:00 - they don't want to know what you read
11:02 - at that point because uh they don't have
11:05 - that time
11:06 - they have to go through a lot of
11:08 - participants so do not include your
11:10 - personal life
11:11 - and do not include anything that is not
11:13 - related to that position that is not
11:15 - relevant only and so now uh go ahead
11:18 - daniel and go to the next screen and
11:20 - tell them what are the tips they can use
11:22 - to answer this question exactly so just
11:25 - to reemphasize on what richie said right
11:27 - here they're trying to see if you're a
11:29 - good fit for the position if you're just
11:30 - telling them about all these
11:32 - random things my personal life don't
11:33 - relate to the position it's not going to
11:35 - help so instead
11:36 - what you want to do is potentially tell
11:38 - a story because us human beings
11:40 - the way we relate is by telling a story
11:43 - and if you're able to include your
11:44 - achievements
11:45 - your work history things that you've
11:47 - done things that are related
11:49 - to that position then they're definitely
11:50 - going to relate to you that's how you
11:52 - build that soft skills you relate to
11:54 - that human
11:54 - but then you show how you're right for
11:57 - that position
11:58 - then what you also want to tell them is
11:59 - what you know about that role because
12:00 - you want to be able to show that
12:02 - you have been doing the research that
12:04 - you do understand what it is that you're
12:06 - playing for
12:07 - and you feel like you are qualified for
12:09 - that so richie
12:11 - let's give him what a great answer looks
12:13 - like go ahead and
12:14 - read it for me brother awesome
12:19 - let's so i think the proper way to
12:22 - answer this question would be something
12:24 - like that
12:25 - that okay uh if someone's asking you
12:28 - tell us something about yourself you can
12:29 - start like that
12:30 - uh i started off my career as a
12:32 - freelancer back in 2019 and i had the
12:35 - privilege to work it clear programmer
12:36 - since almost six months
12:38 - now which has been a great experience
12:40 - joining clear programmer was an
12:42 - excellent opportunity
12:43 - for me and there i'm in charge of
12:45 - focusing highly
12:46 - improving uh student success with a team
12:49 - moreover
12:50 - i know you are looking for someone who
12:52 - can lead a team
12:53 - and i think with my experience in
12:55 - finding gabs
12:56 - and developing a clean and easy process
12:58 - for improving student success i believe
13:00 - that i will succeed in the role
13:02 - you are hiring for and guys make sure to
13:05 - screenshot these answers
13:07 - now what i did in this answer is first i
13:09 - introduced that how i started my career
13:12 - how i got into coding and then i'm also
13:15 - showing them that what i
13:16 - did or what i'm doing right now or what
13:18 - i did in my past and in the end i'm also
13:20 - showing them
13:21 - that uh uh what they are looking for so
13:24 - i told them that i know you are looking
13:25 - for someone who can lead the team
13:27 - and then i'm telling them that why i'm a
13:30 - good fit for
13:30 - that role and that is how a good and
13:33 - there are different ways
13:34 - i'm 100 sure that there are different
13:36 - right ways to answer that as well but
13:38 - this is one of the ways that you can
13:40 - use to answer your question exactly and
13:43 - guys
13:43 - just like how we said in the other slide
13:45 - he's telling a story he's getting them
13:47 - engaged like oh my god this is so cool
13:49 - he was working for them and then he was
13:51 - able to learn all these different things
13:52 - and he fits the position
13:53 - he's the perfect match now let's see
13:56 - well hopefully that's what they say
13:58 - [Laughter]
14:00 - so what's the second type of question
14:01 - that they might get richie
14:04 - so i think the second type of questions
14:06 - they might get is like
14:07 - why do you want this job and when they
14:09 - ask these questions what they mean is
14:11 - that
14:11 - why do you want this specific job at
14:13 - this company why do you want this
14:15 - specific
14:16 - position at this company because they
14:18 - wants to know that what is the one
14:20 - reason that have pushed you
14:21 - to uh apply for this job right and that
14:24 - is the reason they might ask you this
14:26 - job
14:26 - exactly and specificity is key because
14:29 - you don't want to just give bad
14:32 - motivations you want to show that you
14:34 - have the right intrinsic
14:36 - internal motivations but that you're
14:38 - also
14:39 - you know doing things for the right
14:41 - reasons so richie what does a wrong
14:43 - answer look like
14:45 - so i think a lot of people and even me
14:47 - when i started as i said
14:49 - a lot of people would answer something
14:50 - like that that uh
14:52 - as i'm looking for a full-time job as a
14:55 - web developer
14:56 - i think i will be a right fit for this
14:58 - job based on my education and experience
15:00 - that is not a wrong answer that can be a
15:02 - good answer but this is not good enough
15:04 - to get your job
15:05 - just think about this like this way
15:07 - there are 10 people who are attending
15:09 - that interview who are they
15:10 - who are the hiring managers going to be
15:12 - entering 10 people and
15:13 - probably more than uh seven people are
15:16 - gonna be answering the question like
15:18 - this that i want this job
15:19 - because i feel that i'm the right fit
15:21 - based on my education and experience
15:23 - but they they hear this kind of answer
15:26 - a lot of times every single participants
15:28 - they go through they hear
15:29 - answer like this so there are a couple
15:32 - of things that you can avoid while
15:34 - answering uh
15:35 - this question so go ahead daniel and
15:37 - tell them what are the things they can
15:39 - avoid
15:40 - so the first one is you don't want to
15:42 - just
15:43 - show them that you're doing things maybe
15:44 - just for the monetary value
15:46 - the reason is because money is not a
15:48 - great incentive and it's not a great
15:50 - motivator
15:51 - over someone's long-term career span
15:53 - they want someone who's
15:55 - actually motivated by learning who's
15:57 - actually motivated
15:58 - by challenging themselves and developing
16:01 - code as a developer
16:02 - and as a programmer so look here's a
16:04 - reality maybe you do want a little more
16:06 - money maybe your financial situation
16:08 - isn't right and becoming a developer is
16:10 - going to help you there but here's what
16:12 - i
16:12 - challenge you if this is your case i
16:14 - challenge you to see
16:16 - if that's really the only reason that
16:18 - motivates you
16:19 - if it's not perfect because it probably
16:21 - isn't right like
16:22 - coding is too hard my opinion is
16:24 - programming is too hard
16:25 - for oh let me move programming is too
16:27 - hard
16:28 - for you to just slowly be motivated by
16:30 - money and go out there and crush it
16:32 - because you're going to be
16:33 - disappointed you're going to see that
16:35 - your code doesn't work because of some
16:36 - semicolon
16:37 - or some crazy they'd be like man it's
16:38 - not worth that money
16:40 - but if you like the challenge if you
16:42 - like challenging yourself and there's a
16:44 - lot of other things or you're doing it
16:46 - you have a bigger purpose then you want
16:48 - to talk about those things you don't
16:49 - want to talk about money because
16:50 - money is just like this thing that no
16:52 - one cares about right
16:54 - and what's the other one richie so
16:57 - and also i think very well said that and
16:59 - i think uh i think
17:00 - one thing to take away from that is that
17:02 - you should love the process of going
17:04 - through this interviews you should love
17:06 - the process of
17:07 - uh applying for this job because that is
17:09 - something that will
17:10 - let you grow a lot and that will help
17:12 - you to understand this process in a
17:14 - better way
17:14 - so that in next five years or maybe next
17:17 - in two years you will correct the
17:18 - formula to land those jobs
17:20 - so and the second point you might want
17:23 - to avoid is that
17:24 - never show them that you will leave that
17:26 - job for a better job
17:27 - you don't this is like so much crucial
17:29 - that you don't ever ever want to do that
17:31 - like don't show them that you're gonna
17:33 - leave that job if you get a better job
17:35 - next time
17:35 - show them that you're gonna stick to
17:37 - that job and uh i think let's talk about
17:40 - the tips that you can use
17:41 - to answer this question that why do you
17:44 - want to stop
17:45 - so that's gonna there's only gonna be
17:47 - one tip and i think this
17:48 - is like one of the most important thing
17:50 - that you want to use
17:51 - that show a direct connection between
17:54 - you and that specific job
17:56 - period that's it uh just show a direct
17:59 - connection
18:00 - that why do you want a job and i think
18:02 - uh that
18:03 - is one of the most important hiring
18:04 - managers want to know because they
18:06 - get all this kind of answers that i want
18:08 - this job because of my education
18:10 - and my work experience but no they are
18:13 - looking for a react js developer
18:15 - then why do you want this job you want
18:16 - to show them that okay i might have work
18:18 - on the projects they are working
18:20 - in their company right now and i can
18:22 - show them that okay
18:23 - i was working for this kind of project
18:26 - and i'm pretty much
18:26 - interested to work on those kind of
18:28 - projects with you so that i can bring
18:31 - amazing ideas on the table
18:32 - from my experience so let's see a
18:34 - perfect example
18:36 - uh go ahead how to answer
18:39 - why do you want this job exactly so look
18:43 - i realized that this company's name
18:45 - whatever company it is google
18:47 - microsoft whatever is working on
18:48 - building websites mobile applications
18:50 - for educational purposes
18:51 - and institutes that personally fascinate
18:54 - me you see there he's connecting it
18:56 - the motivations that that company has
18:58 - are the same motivations
18:59 - that i have right clever programmer uh
19:02 - where i always looked at uh
19:03 - was more of an online so now he's
19:05 - showing his experience of
19:06 - why right he's like i worked a clever
19:08 - programmer it was one of the online
19:10 - education schools we had different
19:11 - courses
19:12 - and my responsibility was working
19:14 - directly with students to improve
19:16 - their success so in this answer go ahead
19:19 - screenshot it but you'll see how rich is
19:21 - putting himself in the position
19:22 - where he understands the motivation of
19:24 - the company he understands the
19:26 - motivation of the person who needs to be
19:27 - in that position
19:28 - and he's literally just picking himself
19:30 - up and putting himself
19:31 - right there and just positioning himself
19:34 - as the person
19:35 - who needs to have that job what do you
19:37 - say rishi
19:39 - yes for sure uh i just want to read this
19:41 - to them
19:43 - because i think this is uh something
19:44 - important for them so i just want to
19:45 - read them
19:46 - read it to them so let's take an example
19:48 - so you would go like this that i've
19:49 - realized that
19:50 - if it's microsoft let's say i realize
19:52 - microsoft is working on building
19:54 - websites and mobile applications for
19:55 - educational purpose and institutes
19:57 - and that personally fascinates me a lot
19:59 - as my previous company
20:01 - clever programmer where i worked at was
20:03 - more of an online education school
20:05 - where my major responsibilities was to
20:07 - work directly with students to improve
20:10 - their success
20:11 - and i believe which gave me the skills
20:13 - to bring some of the most amazing ideas
20:15 - on the table at microsoft
20:17 - now what i did in this answer is that i
20:20 - figured out a correlation that okay
20:21 - clever programmer is more of an online
20:23 - education school and that company is
20:24 - working on an educational
20:26 - purposes stuff right so i would say that
20:28 - based because i have the experience in
20:30 - students
20:31 - i they know that i can bring some
20:33 - amazing ideas on the table
20:35 - of that company and that is how you can
20:37 - answer that question
20:39 - sorry about that a little technical
20:40 - difficulty here uh
20:42 - here we go what is the third one richie
20:46 - the third one is why do you want this
20:50 - job now how do you try to not want to
20:54 - answer that
20:55 - right go ahead richie show him what's up
20:57 - yeah
20:59 - so i think a lot of people when they are
21:02 - trying to answer that they are going to
21:03 - be like i'm a hard-working talented
21:05 - individual
21:06 - with strong interpersonal skills and i
21:08 - think i'm the perfect person for this
21:10 - role
21:11 - and i think that is not how you answer
21:13 - that a lot of people also
21:15 - i think the second question the third
21:16 - one is the same so i think a lot of
21:18 - people would answer like this as well
21:20 - and i do not think that this is the
21:22 - right way to answer that question
21:24 - so let's talk about the things that you
21:27 - yeah go ahead no go go ahead i'm just
21:28 - gonna
21:29 - lead on to the next one what do they
21:30 - want to avoid rishi
21:34 - so they just want to say you don't want
21:36 - to you never ever want to fake this
21:38 - answer you never want to show that you
21:40 - are perfect now there are two reasons
21:42 - like you don't want
21:43 - you don't want to show perfect because
21:45 - that no one is perfect in the world
21:47 - you can show them like if you are if you
21:48 - do if you like some skills just be
21:50 - honest to them that
21:51 - okay i might not know the skills but
21:53 - tell them that you are keen to learn
21:55 - and you will make sure to them that you
21:57 - are gonna be
21:58 - you're gonna be right fit because you're
22:00 - keen to learn and you will learn those
22:01 - technologies for them
22:03 - and uh and and i think when you lie that
22:05 - you are just perfect
22:06 - and when you fake this answer they're
22:08 - just gonna catch up like this what do
22:10 - you say then you know
22:10 - yeah i mean everyone knows that nobody
22:12 - is perfect right
22:13 - so if you start lying about you being
22:15 - perfect they're going to know you're
22:16 - lying
22:17 - and now they're going to ask themselves
22:18 - do we want to work with the liar
22:20 - and the answer is obviously no nobody
22:22 - wants to work with a liar nobody wants
22:24 - to work with someone with negative
22:25 - energy that has insecurities that they
22:26 - have to lie
22:27 - about their own things they love
22:28 - transparency they love honesty so make
22:31 - sure
22:31 - you do not try to fall into that frame
22:33 - of being perfect so richie
22:35 - what do they want to do
22:39 - yeah so the tip is gonna be that show
22:41 - them
22:42 - why you are unique like based on they
22:44 - are getting like thousands of introduced
22:46 - so you want to show them why you are
22:48 - specifically unique and why you would be
22:50 - a good fit for that job
22:51 - i think that is one of the most
22:52 - important thing you want to show them
22:54 - like why you are unique
22:55 - and the second thing that you can show
22:57 - you uh
22:58 - show you can help them solve their
23:00 - problems and i think this is one of the
23:02 - most important then you'll go ahead and
23:03 - explain why the second point is
23:04 - necessary
23:05 - exactly because the reality is everyone
23:07 - has problems each person has a problem
23:09 - each company has a problem right and the
23:12 - reason the company
23:13 - is opening up this position is because
23:14 - they need someone that's going to help
23:16 - them solve
23:17 - a specific problem maybe they don't have
23:19 - a website maybe they don't have a
23:20 - backend
23:21 - maybe they don't even know how to
23:22 - develop things maybe they just need more
23:24 - bandwidth so if you could show that you
23:26 - can help solve
23:27 - that problem then again you're just
23:29 - putting yourself in that position
23:31 - it's like with these soft skills with
23:33 - these answers you put yourself in the
23:34 - position
23:35 - that they want to hire you so richie
23:38 - what does that look like for them so i
23:41 - think uh
23:42 - just to add to some add something on the
23:44 - last point
23:45 - like as a developer they always see you
23:48 - as a problem solver
23:49 - right and i think that is the reason you
23:52 - want to show them that how you can
23:53 - because
23:53 - honestly just uh frankly speaking no one
23:56 - gives a like
23:57 - how many uh technologies you know and
23:59 - stuff like that they just want to know
24:01 - how you can answer that how you can
24:04 - solve their problem they're facing
24:06 - right now they're if they're lacking a
24:07 - react.js developer who can lead a team
24:09 - how you can show them show them like how
24:11 - you can solve that problem
24:12 - now maybe the right way to answer this
24:14 - question is that
24:15 - you can start by saying that i
24:17 - understand like now you're going to be
24:19 - showing that i also understand that what
24:21 - what is the requirement so you can say
24:23 - that i understand that one of the key
24:25 - requirement for this position
24:26 - is expertise in react.js you should hire
24:29 - me
24:30 - because i have a unique understanding of
24:32 - the latest
24:33 - uh latest concepts of re-exists such as
24:35 - redux and hooks
24:37 - i realized that knowing react native is
24:38 - an asset for this role and i have been
24:40 - working with react native since almost
24:42 - over a year
24:43 - one thing i do not have in my skill sets
24:45 - that you are looking for is
24:46 - react bootstrap but i'm eager to learn
24:49 - it from amazing people and i do not
24:51 - believe it will be hard for me
24:53 - to catch up uh and i also learned that
24:55 - your company values leadership and i
24:57 - know without a doubt
24:58 - i will sustain the company's standards
25:00 - and lead the team to a greater success
25:02 - now go ahead daniel why answering a
25:04 - question why answering this question
25:06 - this is important like what are the
25:08 - important things they can
25:10 - what are key takeaways from this answer
25:12 - again guys look
25:13 - richie puts himself in the position of i
25:15 - know react.js i know redux hooks you
25:17 - know i'm in the latest trend i know
25:18 - what's going on
25:19 - but look how he also shows the
25:21 - imperfection was like but i don't know
25:23 - react bootstrap which is something that
25:24 - was asked for with this project
25:26 - but then again look how he shows that
25:29 - he's open-minded he's willing to work
25:31 - he's willing to learn
25:33 - he says he would be willing to work
25:35 - harder and try to learn these new
25:37 - technologies to be able to do what he
25:38 - needs to be able to lead the team
25:40 - and solve the specific problems so i
25:43 - think this covers all the tips that you
25:45 - talked about richie there anything else
25:47 - you want to add to that
25:50 - no for sure i think uh that's it but
25:52 - make sure
25:53 - guys to subscribe screenshot this and if
25:56 - you want a free training on netflix
25:58 - clone
25:59 - the link is in the description go ahead
26:00 - and subscribe that it's a complete free
26:02 - training
26:03 - exactly now the reason why we're telling
26:05 - you to go get that free training is
26:06 - because
26:07 - it's hard to get this interview if you
26:08 - don't have awesome portfolio build up
26:11 - like the netflix clone like the amazon
26:13 - clone like all these other clones that
26:14 - we're building so guys
26:15 - go ahead go to that link if you want to
26:18 - get that first step into getting these
26:19 - interviews so with that being said
26:20 - richie
26:21 - what is the fourth common question
26:26 - the fourth common question is what is
26:28 - your greatest weakness
26:30 - and as you can see that meme at the
26:32 - bottom i would say
26:34 - nothing i wish it was nothing right
26:37 - what is your greatest weakness daniel
26:39 - what is your greatest weakness let's
26:40 - let's
26:40 - apart from the interview things like
26:42 - what is your christmas weakness
26:44 - exactly so the way that i like to
26:46 - approach this one
26:47 - is i like to very similar to the other
26:51 - ones
26:51 - is i might specifically talk about
26:54 - something
26:55 - that you know i'm transparent i'm open
26:58 - i'm not going to lie to them but it does
27:00 - take a lot of self-awareness right like
27:02 - maybe it's like oh man
27:03 - i'm a perfectionist or i do something
27:05 - like that right
27:06 - but you have to one note why that's a
27:09 - weakness like what are the downsides of
27:10 - that
27:11 - and then two or actually when i get into
27:13 - this but two
27:14 - i talk about how i'm improving that so
27:16 - richie go ahead and dive into some of
27:18 - these wrong
27:19 - answers and expand a little more
27:22 - [Music]
27:23 - a lot of people like when they're
27:25 - answering this question is that
27:27 - my greatest weakness is i work super
27:29 - hard and i guarantee you on that that
27:31 - there are like a bunch of lot of people
27:33 - who are answering like this
27:35 - and that makes like i i and it's
27:37 - completely okay like when you are when
27:38 - you are beginner
27:39 - you like i used to answer uh questions
27:42 - like this and that's completely okay but
27:43 - it makes me laugh that i used to answer
27:45 - like that that i work super hard and i
27:47 - think that's like a no no no
27:49 - if you're gonna go to an interviewer and
27:51 - let's uh and you're gonna say that my
27:52 - weaknesses i work super hard
27:54 - just kidding it makes me laugh right now
27:57 - so they're just gonna be laughing hard
27:59 - inside
27:59 - but they cannot definitely show you but
28:01 - yeah they are gonna be
28:02 - and uh maybe like there are different
28:04 - wrong answers for this that
28:06 - uh some people would say that nothing i
28:07 - do not have any weakness and when you
28:09 - say that
28:10 - what you're trying to do is that you're
28:11 - trying to prove them that you are
28:13 - perfect you do not have any weakness
28:15 - and i would say that there is not a
28:17 - single person on earth
28:18 - that would not have a single weakness in
28:21 - them because no one is perfect everyone
28:23 - is still learning
28:24 - and everyone wants to learn and you want
28:26 - to show that part
28:27 - instead of just showing them that uh you
28:30 - are perfect and you do not have any
28:32 - weakness what what's your take on that
28:34 - daniel like you have been
28:36 - uh working with uh blue origin which is
28:38 - a company from
28:39 - amazon and uh that's a great company
28:42 - guys um
28:43 - so what is your take on that why do you
28:45 - want to not show them that you are
28:47 - perfect
28:48 - look exactly the first one very like
28:50 - we're talking about soft skills with
28:51 - soft skills is how you communicate with
28:53 - people
28:53 - so the first one just shows you're
28:55 - completely arrogant right
28:57 - like if you're going to say that you
28:58 - work super hard as a weakness it's like
29:00 - no this guy's not like
29:01 - he's arrogant he thinks he's like that's
29:04 - not confidence that's being cocky
29:06 - right it's like nobody wants to work
29:07 - with someone like that the second one
29:09 - you just straight up blind again like we
29:11 - said we all know that nobody is perfect
29:13 - so if you don't talk about those things
29:15 - that make you imperfect
29:16 - they're going to realize that you're not
29:17 - open you're not honest and you're not
29:19 - transparent
29:20 - so what else do they want to avoid
29:24 - so uh they want to avoid never to fake
29:28 - this answer because like you should not
29:30 - fake this answer that doesn't mean that
29:32 - you should hide some stuff
29:33 - but you don't want to fake this answer
29:36 - at all because as daniel said you want
29:38 - to show them
29:38 - that you are perfect never ever do that
29:40 - because the hiring managers interview
29:42 - like thousands of people in a year and
29:44 - they would just catch up like this that
29:46 - you are faking this answer
29:47 - so do not fake this answer the next
29:49 - thing you want to avoid is never show a
29:51 - witness
29:52 - which is harder or impossible to change
29:54 - now i think this is one of the most
29:56 - important thing
29:56 - you don't want to show like also you at
29:58 - the same time when you're not faking
30:00 - this answer
30:01 - you don't want to show them a weakness
30:03 - which is harder impossible to change
30:05 - let's say that let's let's talk about
30:07 - that i'm a very bad temper person
30:09 - and i think in order to change that
30:12 - weakness of yourself
30:13 - uh it's gonna take years i mean it's
30:15 - probably
30:16 - you can change that definitely but it's
30:18 - gonna take years because you have been
30:19 - bad temper since maybe childhood
30:21 - then they're probably gonna feel that no
30:24 - no for this person
30:25 - because they have a weakness which is
30:28 - very hard
30:29 - or maybe impossible to change in real
30:31 - life so
30:32 - that is the reason you don't want to
30:34 - show them a weakness which is almost
30:36 - impossible to change you want to show
30:38 - them something that is possible
30:40 - and that can be changed right daniel so
30:42 - why don't you go ahead and talk about
30:44 - tips they can use to answer this
30:46 - question exactly so again
30:48 - if you show that realistic weakness
30:50 - you're not going to come out as cocky or
30:52 - arrogant
30:53 - you're going to come out as vulnerable
30:55 - open
30:56 - honest and they'll be like all right
30:57 - that's someone that i could connect with
30:58 - that's someone that i could talk to
31:00 - now if you show something you can change
31:02 - you could talk about how you're trying
31:04 - to change those things and what you're
31:05 - currently doing
31:06 - to try to improve those things because
31:08 - again we all have weaknesses just
31:10 - not everybody is trying to improve their
31:13 - weaknesses so richie let's go ahead and
31:16 - get into
31:17 - a right answer
31:20 - yep awesome let's go ahead and write
31:23 - read the right answer so i
31:25 - when you are answering this you want to
31:27 - make sure that you show them that there
31:28 - is a weakness in you
31:30 - but that can be changed so let's focus
31:32 - let's i'm gonna read out to you
31:33 - make sure to screenshot this that i'm
31:35 - gonna read out to you i
31:36 - realized with my experience that my
31:38 - greatest weakness is that i get
31:40 - overwhelmed when a deadline is near
31:43 - and then it is very hard for me to
31:45 - manage time and complete it before
31:47 - deadline
31:48 - now i'm gonna i'm showing them that
31:50 - there is a weakness in me
31:51 - that uh when there is a deadline i get
31:53 - overwhelmed now but i'm gonna also show
31:55 - them that
31:55 - but i have been working on them on that
31:58 - since
31:59 - last month and i'm even doing some
32:01 - courses on time management
32:02 - which has strongly helped me to improve
32:04 - my weakness and i believe with time
32:06 - i will be able to improve it completely
32:09 - so
32:10 - uh now i start by saying that okay i do
32:12 - have a weakness and i'm gonna i'm
32:14 - showing them that i have a weakness
32:16 - that can't be changed that uh that i get
32:18 - uh tends to i get overwhelmed i tend to
32:21 - freak out when there is deadline
32:22 - near uh but uh when there's a deadline
32:25 - near a job when i have to submit a
32:26 - project to the client
32:28 - but i have been working on that and i'm
32:30 - doing some courses on the time manager
32:32 - as well so they are like okay this guy
32:34 - is honest
32:34 - that he accepts he have this weakness
32:37 - now they're also thinking that okay at
32:38 - the same time
32:39 - he's when i'm showing them some proof
32:41 - i'm showing them them
32:42 - some social proof that okay since last
32:44 - month i'm even doing some courses on
32:46 - time management so that they know that
32:48 - this guy is very open-minded
32:50 - and he wants to work on those weakness
32:52 - that is the reason
32:53 - he's working on that and then he also
32:55 - says that i believe with time
32:57 - i will be able to improve it completely
32:59 - and when i say the last sentence i
33:00 - believe with time i will be able to
33:02 - improve it completely
33:03 - they would believe it because i i'm
33:05 - honest with them and when you're honest
33:07 - with them and
33:07 - then when you tell them that i'm also
33:09 - working on something there there are
33:10 - chances that 99 or 0.99
33:13 - they would believe you what what's your
33:14 - take you know because uh you have been
33:16 - working with
33:16 - a lot of amazing people and they have a
33:18 - lot of weaknesses right they have a lot
33:20 - of weakness and they would always be
33:21 - open mind to confess that with you right
33:23 - so have you been in a situation or
33:25 - something like that
33:26 - where you know that this guy has this
33:27 - weakness and he's very open-minded
33:29 - and he's eager to learn even you can
33:31 - talk about yourself right
33:32 - that some weakness you had yeah i mean
33:35 - this this is also just
33:36 - a the perfect answer if you're seeing
33:38 - this screenshot it
33:40 - write something like that but yeah when
33:41 - i've had conversations with co-workers
33:43 - it's just about being open it's just
33:45 - about being transparent and it's about
33:46 - being honest
33:47 - and trying to see how him or her or both
33:50 - of you guys
33:50 - could come to the right solution because
33:52 - in the end of the day you're problem
33:54 - solver that means technical skills
33:55 - that means people skills whatever that
33:58 - may be so
33:59 - guys take a screenshot of this picture
34:01 - and
34:02 - richie let's go ahead and get into the
34:05 - next one
34:06 - what type of question is that richie
34:07 - awesome
34:09 - that is what is your greatest strength
34:12 - obviously you are not a super
34:13 - man but then how do you answer this
34:16 - question
34:16 - what is your greatest strength what
34:18 - strength do you want to show them
34:20 - what strength do you want to hide from
34:22 - them and how do you answer that question
34:24 - now let's go ahead then you'll go ahead
34:26 - and tell them what is the wrong answer a
34:27 - lot of people would
34:29 - uh use well the wrong answer would be my
34:31 - greatest strength is that i am able to
34:34 - complete every task on time and i feel i
34:37 - am perfect
34:38 - at whatever i do because i'm superman
34:40 - right
34:41 - and that is the wrong answer again
34:43 - because
34:45 - you're expecting perfectionism from that
34:47 - person so what do they want to avoid
34:48 - when talking about these answers
34:51 - so i think you want to show a strength
34:54 - which is not a real no
34:56 - you don't want to show them a strength
34:58 - which is not a realistic again
35:00 - like just like weakness you wanna you
35:02 - you wanna show a strength
35:03 - which is completely realistic not
35:05 - something that no one can be perfect and
35:07 - i don't think that every
35:09 - no one can uh submit everything on time
35:11 - yeah there can be some people who would
35:13 - have done that
35:13 - but there is no one perfect so you don't
35:15 - want to show them a strength which is
35:17 - not realistic
35:18 - another thing that uh never shows
35:20 - strength which is not related to that
35:23 - to that role so maybe like if some
35:25 - person is asking the firing managers are
35:26 - going to be asking you that what's your
35:28 - strength and
35:28 - you started talking like my greatest
35:30 - strength is that
35:31 - uh i can't run like at uh
35:34 - 30 miles per hour yeah probably like
35:38 - i make some bomb ass hot chocolate so
35:41 - i'm not gonna be like
35:42 - hey uh what's your greatest
35:43 - strengthening because pregnant oh my hot
35:45 - chocolate
35:46 - you should see it i put the right amount
35:47 - of milk the right amount of cream
35:49 - the hot chocolate is amazing i mean it's
35:52 - strength right
35:53 - but it's not related to what they're
35:56 - looking for so what are the tips that we
35:57 - need to give them
35:59 - yeah it just makes me laugh that
36:02 - you're talking about how to make that
36:04 - hot chocolate
36:06 - you probably don't want to know that
36:08 - what kind of chocolates you make
36:10 - so you probably want to avoid that but
36:13 - one tip you want to take in consider is
36:16 - that show a strength
36:17 - which you have which matches the job
36:20 - description
36:20 - now what how you can do that is go
36:23 - through the job description
36:24 - read it carefully like even if it take
36:26 - one hour two hours
36:28 - doesn't matter you need that job if you
36:30 - have that interview go to that job
36:32 - description
36:32 - like and then read out all the things
36:35 - that they need
36:36 - from a person they want to be hiring and
36:38 - then you figure out that okay they need
36:40 - a react.js developer
36:41 - what are your strengths that you can
36:43 - show them because
36:45 - they just care how you can help them how
36:47 - you can solve their problem again back
36:49 - to the agenda that how you can solve the
36:50 - problem
36:50 - so you want to show them a strength
36:52 - which is going to be
36:54 - which is going to help them and not just
36:56 - help you to
36:57 - maybe just market yourself about your
36:59 - hot chocolate right
37:00 - so what does that answer look like
37:02 - richie
37:03 - okay so i'm going to read it for you
37:05 - make sure to screenshot this uh yeah
37:08 - so i that's how it starts i feel my
37:11 - greatest strength is knowing the latest
37:13 - react hooks and debugging the code when
37:16 - using react.js
37:17 - in my previous role i was responsible
37:19 - for highly using
37:21 - and teaching latest concepts of react
37:23 - like hooks and giving feedback to
37:24 - students on that code
37:26 - which helped me to have a better
37:27 - understanding of debugging the code with
37:30 - minimal errors moreover while studying
37:32 - mobile application development
37:34 - in my college i learned the importance
37:36 - of react hooks and had the opportunity
37:38 - to work on some real world projects
37:40 - now when i'm talking this uh when i'm
37:43 - answering discussion
37:44 - i suddenly start with my greatest
37:45 - strength is what are the greatest
37:47 - so i know that they are looking for
37:48 - someone who can work with rex and they
37:50 - also want someone who knows react hooks
37:52 - and who is good at debugging the code so
37:54 - that's how i start that okay i
37:56 - had this trend in me because even if
37:58 - they start asking me some questions
37:59 - about hooks and debugging i can answer
38:01 - that so that i have this strength in me
38:03 - which is directly correlated to the job
38:05 - description and that is what i have
38:06 - exactly shown here and then i'm also
38:08 - talking about that
38:09 - why i have this trend so most important
38:12 - thing while answering the question uh
38:13 - daniel
38:13 - is social proof i'm saying them that i
38:16 - was responsible for teaching
38:17 - the latest concept of react in my
38:19 - previous job and
38:21 - giving feedback on their code so that
38:22 - helped me to understand uh
38:24 - debugging the code with minimal errors
38:26 - right so this is the social proof that
38:28 - i'm providing
38:29 - so make sure when you answer every
38:30 - question you provide them a social proof
38:33 - that
38:33 - why you are good at this thing not just
38:35 - showing them that
38:36 - because it's it's important to answer
38:39 - that question in a proper way that
38:41 - you know we know that you know that you
38:43 - are you have this trend but the most
38:45 - important thing is
38:46 - why do you have discern how do you
38:48 - develop this trend so you want to show
38:49 - them that i developed this trend from
38:51 - your
38:51 - from my previous job or something like
38:52 - that and also just uh some extra bonus
38:55 - that
38:55 - uh while studying this uh in my college
38:58 - i also get to work on some real-world
38:59 - projects
39:00 - so what do you feel about this and said
39:03 - daniel what are the key take away from
39:05 - toys answer it's like i said great
39:07 - answer because you're showing the
39:09 - strength that is related to the position
39:10 - you're putting yourself
39:11 - and showing them that you fit this exact
39:14 - position right and then you're giving
39:16 - that social proof which just
39:18 - furthermore reinforces that they should
39:20 - hire you
39:21 - for that position so i would say
39:23 - screenshot it
39:24 - awesome answer and let's go on to number
39:27 - six which is
39:28 - what is your expected salary and we're
39:31 - gonna be there like danny devito
39:33 - throwing dollar bills at all of them
39:35 - ready to just make it rain cash so what
39:38 - does a bad answer look like richie
39:42 - uh probably when you're asked like what
39:44 - is your expected salary
39:46 - like a lot of people would answer
39:48 - something like i do not have any salary
39:50 - range
39:50 - because they don't have done their
39:52 - research uh they would be like i'm happy
39:54 - to work on
39:55 - work for whatever i get this get at this
39:57 - time as i'm starting my career and just
39:59 - want to learn
40:00 - okay that is okay that you are happy to
40:03 - work for whatever you get at this point
40:05 - of your career
40:06 - and because you are just starting out
40:08 - your career you just want to learn
40:10 - but that does not mean that does not
40:12 - mean that you don't provide them a
40:14 - salary range
40:15 - and for that you need to be prepared so
40:18 - so daniel uh you might have uh you might
40:21 - have got a question like this that or
40:22 - you might have even like
40:24 - hired someone uh with your job that uh
40:26 - and
40:27 - you guys might have asked questions like
40:28 - i do not have us uh
40:30 - what's your sell what's your expected
40:31 - salary so what do you think that there
40:33 - are other wrong ways to answer this
40:35 - question
40:35 - uh instead of just saying that i do not
40:36 - have a salary range what do you think
40:38 - about that there's multiple wrong ways
40:40 - but maybe what's important to
40:41 - start to go towards is the right answer
40:44 - and that's i mean you just want to at
40:45 - least have
40:46 - some knowledge some knowledge of how
40:49 - much you should be worth
40:50 - what people are paying for so you want
40:52 - to make sure you prepare for those
40:54 - things but
40:55 - what are the things that they do want to
40:56 - avoid when answering these questions
40:58 - richie
41:01 - so uh let's go ahead and talk about the
41:03 - thing so
41:04 - the first thing you want to avoid is
41:06 - that never show them you don't
41:08 - uh never show you don't care about money
41:10 - you want to show them yes you do care
41:12 - about the money
41:14 - uh of course you are not just there for
41:16 - money uh
41:17 - but yes you do care about money because
41:19 - those are your skills
41:20 - those are the things that uh you have
41:22 - worked on you have spent like hours and
41:24 - hours and years and years
41:26 - to learn those skills now you don't want
41:28 - to show them that you don't care about
41:29 - money
41:30 - of course you don't you of course you do
41:32 - care about the money but at the same
41:33 - time
41:34 - you don't want to make them feel that
41:35 - you only and only care about
41:37 - money and the second thing uh you don't
41:40 - want to show them
41:41 - is never sure you can also you can work
41:43 - you can also work
41:44 - for less money now these are the two
41:46 - most important thing i have realized
41:48 - because uh a lot of people uh they just
41:50 - uh
41:51 - when hiring managers are asking that
41:52 - what is your expected seller they always
41:54 - try to feel that
41:55 - okay like uh maybe they have a budget
41:57 - and what if like i answered that
41:59 - answer uh give them a salary range which
42:02 - is not into their budget and they're
42:03 - just not going to hire me that's not
42:04 - true
42:05 - you when you when you show that
42:08 - sometimes what happens is not sometime
42:09 - most of most of the time what happens is
42:11 - that
42:11 - if you have a good technical skills if
42:13 - you're a good soft skill what they're
42:14 - gonna do is that they're gonna make you
42:17 - do the same job for less money they
42:19 - might have a budget for like eighty
42:21 - thousand dollars
42:22 - for that job but if you show them that
42:23 - you don't care about money maybe they
42:25 - would just make you do that job for
42:26 - seventy thousand dollars or maybe even
42:28 - 65
42:29 - so you never ever want to show that that
42:32 - you don't care about money you want to
42:34 - show them
42:34 - of course you do care about the money
42:36 - but the same time you don't
42:37 - only care about the money so if you want
42:40 - if you want
42:41 - to like um if you if you want to know
42:44 - like how but you'll be like how do i
42:47 - figure out that
42:48 - uh how the hell like what's my salary
42:50 - like i don't know i never worked before
42:52 - like how do i know so daniel like
42:54 - why don't you tell them that how do they
42:55 - know that like
42:57 - they don't if they don't have a salary
42:59 - range what they can do
43:00 - i mean if you don't have a salary range
43:02 - you could easily just go to dr google
43:04 - and you go to dr google and you figure
43:07 - it out you put in
43:08 - what is the salary range that is
43:10 - expected because you need to know
43:12 - what you're worth what your skills are
43:14 - worth and what your value is worth
43:15 - so what are some of these tips that we
43:17 - should give them richie after they go to
43:19 - dr google and figure those things out
43:22 - actually that's one of the tips right
43:23 - yeah so as daniel
43:25 - yeah so as danielle said that you want
43:28 - to go to dr
43:28 - google you want to ask google that
43:32 - you want to go and just search for like
43:33 - if you're searching for a
43:35 - reac js developer in usa you want to go
43:38 - to that
43:39 - what is the annual salary uh fresh
43:41 - reactions developer would get
43:42 - and you will find tons of like a salary
43:45 - uh you will find a tons of website that
43:46 - shows a salary rate
43:47 - now if you are like if you have some
43:49 - experience and you want to go with an
43:51 - average salary with you just because you
43:53 - have like you got couple of three or
43:54 - four years of experience in reach chase
43:56 - and then uh you just go to google and
43:57 - you search like what is the average
43:59 - salary of react js
44:00 - and in united states and i think it's
44:02 - probably 120 k and it's a huge
44:05 - right daniel vhs is picking up guys by
44:08 - the way
44:08 - it's picking up super fast and that's
44:10 - why our papa reacts sunny
44:11 - aka sunny is uh making those amazing
44:14 - clones
44:14 - and just to make sure like we have also
44:17 - uh organized uh
44:19 - if you're watching this if you have
44:20 - joined this late we have organized a
44:22 - completely free training for you guys we
44:24 - are going to be building a netflix clone
44:27 - in that free training and uh as then
44:29 - you'll say
44:30 - that you if you're if you land those
44:32 - interview first of all you need those
44:34 - projects so
44:35 - go sign up the link is in the
44:37 - description go sign up
44:38 - for those projects uh and uh for those
44:41 - for that netflix clone completely free
44:44 - training
44:45 - and make sure to have that project on
44:47 - your resume
44:48 - now let's talk about the tips before you
44:51 - answer questions
44:52 - before you answer that question ask
44:54 - questions about the role because you
44:56 - just don't want to give
44:57 - you even if you know salaries you don't
44:59 - want to shoot a salary in air because
45:01 - you want to know like what is expected
45:03 - from that job maybe they're giving some
45:05 - bonuses maybe they're just giving
45:06 - because like most of the time in uh in
45:08 - canada like a lot of people
45:10 - a lot of jobs they provide you uh uh
45:13 - even if you're if you're not a permanent
45:15 - resident they provide you with a health
45:16 - benefit
45:17 - so you might pro when you provide a
45:18 - salary range that might be
45:20 - you might think that they were going to
45:21 - provide me a health benefit now
45:23 - if you if you you might want to ask
45:25 - questions about dead role right maybe
45:27 - like what if they are expecting someone
45:29 - who uh who can work overtime for them
45:31 - who can work
45:32 - in weekends for them so before you
45:34 - answer that question
45:35 - you want to make sure that you know
45:37 - almost every single thing about that
45:39 - role
45:40 - what do you think about it daniel
45:41 - because i think this is very important i
45:43 - think
45:43 - we should i it's really important to uh
45:46 - talk about this
45:47 - yeah for sure because if you don't
45:49 - understand
45:50 - what you're signing yourself up for then
45:53 - you
45:53 - you just can't be throwing random
45:55 - numbers right like if you're gonna be
45:56 - putting in
45:57 - a lot of hours over time working
45:59 - weekends then you might actually want to
46:01 - ask for even more than the regular
46:03 - salary range if you're gonna be working
46:04 - less
46:05 - there's already a lot of benefits
46:06 - included then it's not unfair for you to
46:08 - ask for like
46:09 - a lot more money than way more than the
46:11 - market average right so just
46:13 - understanding what's that position that
46:15 - is open for you
46:17 - so then the second tip again would be
46:20 - researching
46:20 - the current market for your specific
46:22 - position and again goes back to question
46:24 - one or the tip number one which is
46:26 - understanding what it is that they are
46:29 - looking for
46:29 - and that role specifically and what's
46:31 - that fifth tip richie
46:33 - or sorry third trip tip
46:38 - so the third tip would be always ask for
46:40 - five to ten k more because they will
46:42 - negotiate
46:43 - and that is something that you should
46:45 - always do like if you're in north
46:46 - america
46:47 - probably always go for five to ten
46:49 - thousand dollars more because they are
46:50 - always always going to be negotiating i
46:53 - swear to god that you're always gonna
46:54 - negotiate and he did don't
46:56 - good for you you got five to ten
46:58 - thousand more than you expected right
47:00 - so uh because that thing happens a lot
47:02 - because
47:03 - talk about something that daniel that
47:04 - how how do they negotiate like why do
47:06 - you want to tell them that
47:08 - uh if you if you are like if you if your
47:09 - expected salary is 60 000
47:11 - you always want to go with that i'm
47:13 - expecting something around
47:14 - uh 65 to 70k why do you want to why do
47:17 - you want to do that
47:18 - go ahead and explain them briefly like
47:20 - they want to do that because look
47:22 - best case scenario if you give you know
47:25 - a 10 case 5k more or whatever
47:27 - they say yes he's like all right cool
47:28 - now you have more salary for the year
47:30 - now if they say yes right away maybe
47:31 - they were already giving you a super low
47:33 - expected one regardless but regardless
47:35 - when you negotiate
47:36 - you always want to aim higher because
47:38 - they're the ones that are going to start
47:39 - lower
47:40 - and then you want to try to find each
47:42 - other in the middle if you go to your
47:43 - expected range
47:45 - or what you think you're going to get
47:46 - right away and they go lower it's always
47:48 - going to keep on going down
47:49 - so if you add that 5 to 10k cushion and
47:52 - it make
47:53 - it goes down to the middle it might go
47:54 - to that original salary you first
47:56 - expected
47:58 - yes for sure and one thing to note over
48:00 - uh one thing to note is that
48:02 - the first uh tip tip number one before
48:04 - answering and ask question about it
48:06 - that is important make sure because like
48:08 - once you give them a
48:10 - once you provide them a salary range
48:11 - there's no go back
48:13 - there is no go back like if you tell
48:15 - them that i'm expecting something around
48:16 - uh 60 000 and then they're gonna
48:19 - negotiate
48:20 - and you might settle for 55 and then you
48:22 - don't have health benefits you don't
48:24 - have a lot of stuff you have to work in
48:25 - the weekends you have to work overtime
48:27 - so then there's no go back so you want
48:30 - to ask them questions
48:32 - before before you are answering or
48:35 - the question uh how what is your
48:37 - expected salary
48:38 - now let's go ahead daniel and let's talk
48:41 - about
48:41 - what can be the perfect answer for them
48:44 - uh
48:44 - for to answer what is your expected
48:47 - salary
48:48 - so i'll just read it straight out and
48:51 - the first one is before i answer that
48:53 - question i would like to know more about
48:55 - what that job has to offer me
48:57 - including bonuses insurance and would
48:59 - like to know my responsibilities briefly
49:01 - again this is going back
49:02 - to tip number one so once they answer
49:05 - those things for you
49:06 - you now have a better understanding of
49:08 - the job you now have a better idea of
49:09 - the job
49:10 - so now you could relate how you would
49:12 - fit that and based on my experience
49:14 - current market and what the job has to
49:16 - offer me i would say i would like to go
49:17 - between 75
49:19 - to 80 000 and if this is the job that is
49:22 - offered to me i'm sure we can come up
49:24 - with an agreement
49:25 - on the salary so again you're saying
49:28 - you're open for negotiation
49:29 - you already did your mark your research
49:31 - the 75 to 80k might be an extra 5 to 10k
49:33 - from what you originally expected and
49:35 - you're saying you're open to negotiating
49:36 - so they're
49:37 - more than happy to work with you if they
49:38 - want you for that job
49:41 - yes and last sentence in this answer uh
49:44 - in the second answer is
49:46 - must must think that you you want to say
49:48 - that i'm sure we can come to an
49:49 - agreement on salary because when you're
49:51 - providing them similar range okay now
49:53 - you got your uh
49:54 - all you know all the responsibilities
49:55 - about your job briefly
49:57 - now you know that what salary range
49:58 - you're providing you're providing them a
50:00 - five to ten thousand dollar more salary
50:01 - rate
50:02 - but sometimes sometimes hiring managers
50:04 - uh they
50:05 - don't feel that they want to negotiate
50:06 - so if you provide them 75 to 80k they
50:09 - just have a budget for like 60k
50:10 - or 65k they'll uh they're going to be
50:12 - like no i don't want to hire this guy
50:14 - because he has more budget
50:15 - so at the end you want to add this line
50:18 - that i'm sure we can come to an
50:20 - agreement on
50:21 - salary if you can say something like if
50:23 - this job is offered to me
50:24 - i'm sure we can come to an agreement on
50:26 - salary and when you say that
50:28 - they they know that uh this person is
50:31 - ready for negotiation so that is the
50:33 - reason you guys want to say that
50:36 - awesome screenshot this don't forget to
50:38 - screenshot that guys screenshot it right
50:40 - now i'll give you a couple more seconds
50:42 - all right your couple seconds are over
50:43 - next one
50:44 - so like four i went fast i went fast man
50:47 - number seven they're gonna ask you
50:51 - what are your goals and you're gonna be
50:53 - like man i got
50:54 - lots of goals man what's the wrong
50:57 - answer that some people say richie
51:02 - uh a lot of people would answer
51:04 - something like i see myself in
51:06 - like i i think and it's it's not wrong
51:09 - like a lot of people would answer that
51:11 - i see myself in a managerial position or
51:14 - i dream to have my own company
51:15 - for what i learned from here in next few
51:17 - years boss
51:19 - the wrong thing over here is again you
51:22 - are showing them
51:22 - you're going to leave that job even
51:25 - though
51:26 - you want to own your company next few
51:28 - years even though
51:29 - you you see yourself in that manager
51:31 - position work hard
51:33 - but do not show them that you're going
51:35 - to be leaving that job
51:36 - what's your take on daniel i just want
51:37 - to talk more on that because like a lot
51:39 - of people when they ask about goals like
51:41 - they try to be smart but at the same
51:43 - time like they don't know that when
51:45 - trying to be smart
51:46 - they are making a mistake showing them
51:48 - that you will live you are going to be
51:50 - leaving the job
51:50 - so what are the things they can avoid
51:52 - for sure so like how we just said you
51:54 - don't want to show them that you're just
51:56 - trying to use them so that you could
51:57 - leave them
51:58 - right sometimes you're looking for
51:59 - someone who's going to stay there
52:01 - and who's going to have a lot of impact
52:03 - on the company
52:04 - so instead of trying to be like oh yeah
52:05 - i just i just want to use you guys for a
52:07 - couple years and then
52:08 - leave you guys i mean maybe that's the
52:10 - truth but that's not how you want to go
52:12 - about it
52:13 - so instead what are some things or
52:15 - what's this no they want to see you are
52:17 - in their company for long term
52:18 - and wants to hire someone for this job
52:21 - only so i'm not saying lie and say
52:23 - i want to stay with you guys for 50
52:26 - years if that's not the truth right
52:27 - that's not the truth don't lie about it
52:29 - but talk about your couple years that
52:31 - you plan on being with them which is
52:33 - you know in those three years those five
52:35 - years or whatever you don't have to
52:36 - specify but say
52:37 - with my time with you guys i want to be
52:40 - able to do
52:41 - all these different things so that is
52:42 - exactly what the tip will lead them to
52:45 - which is what richie
52:49 - yes so exactly uh just so the tip is
52:51 - that
52:52 - show them that you will improve this
52:54 - position and
52:55 - how you can improve this position and
52:58 - how you can improve
52:58 - so the thing is that the thing is that
53:01 - any hiring manager in the world you can
53:02 - pick up any hiding manager
53:04 - they want if they have posted a posting
53:06 - if they have posted a job
53:08 - uh on whatever platform they're posting
53:10 - they want someone for specific that job
53:12 - they don't want someone uh they don't
53:14 - want someone for the
53:15 - who's gonna be managing the next five
53:16 - years or next three years they don't
53:18 - want someone who wants to have their own
53:19 - company next three years
53:20 - they want someone for that specific job
53:23 - and that is the reason you just want to
53:26 - show them
53:26 - how you will improve this position and
53:29 - you want to show them that you will
53:31 - improve this position and how you will
53:33 - extend the capabilities of this project
53:35 - so daniel before we get to the right
53:37 - answer
53:37 - i want to ask something that because
53:39 - blue origin is hiring like a lot of
53:41 - amazing people
53:42 - like you so what do you think that uh
53:45 - do dick i mean uh probably i want your
53:48 - take on that
53:48 - so do take consider people who have
53:51 - dream who have bigger dreams like they
53:52 - want to have their open uh
53:54 - they want to open their own amazon in
53:57 - next few years or open their own blurry
53:59 - do they consider something like that or
54:00 - it's just a false thing that you want to
54:02 - avoid
54:03 - no i mean they in the end
54:06 - they would probably if it's a company
54:08 - that doesn't support your long-term
54:10 - goals it's probably not a company you
54:11 - want to work for plain and simple
54:13 - right it's probably toxic it's probably
54:15 - not the right environment
54:16 - there's probably people there who would
54:17 - hold you back as opposed to trying to
54:19 - help you propel forward
54:20 - so when i worked at blue origin it was
54:22 - completely different it was people who
54:23 - were encouraging
54:24 - it was people who wanted you to succeed
54:26 - whether it was with them
54:27 - or not now here's the thing when i
54:29 - showed up to the interview i wasn't
54:30 - talking about the things i was trying to
54:31 - do without them
54:32 - i was talking about the things that i
54:33 - was going to improve in there
54:35 - in that position and those kind of
54:37 - things but again if you if
54:39 - if it's a company where you talk about
54:40 - like oh yeah and i also want to have a
54:41 - business in 10 years
54:43 - and they're like oh we don't want you
54:44 - well good don't be with them they're
54:46 - probably very toxic
54:47 - environment to be with so what does a
54:50 - right answer look like richie
54:54 - awesome let's go ahead and uh let's read
54:56 - the right answer
54:57 - [Music]
54:59 - go ahead brother okay so
55:03 - when they're asking like what are your
55:04 - goals you want to show them that you're
55:06 - going to stay into that position you are
55:08 - perfect for that question you're going
55:10 - to expand the capabilities of the
55:11 - position so here we go
55:13 - make sure to screenshot that uh here we
55:15 - go in the next few years
55:16 - i see myself greatly improving my in my
55:19 - role
55:20 - and be an expert in developing websites
55:22 - in react with latest tech
55:24 - i plan to immerse and understand areas
55:27 - and
55:27 - gaps that can be improved in this
55:29 - position
55:30 - and expertise on how i can guide the new
55:33 - joiners in the right direction
55:34 - moreover i also look forward to utilize
55:37 - what i learned from here
55:38 - and help other department department as
55:41 - well
55:41 - now what i have done here is that i have
55:44 - shown them that
55:44 - okay they are looking for a react.js
55:46 - developer but they also want someone who
55:48 - can stay at the latest 10
55:49 - trend so i'm telling them that i see
55:51 - myself to be an expert in developing
55:53 - websites with react
55:55 - but with the latest stack now i'm also
55:57 - showing them that i plan to find the
55:59 - areas in the gaps
56:00 - that will be lacking uh what
56:02 - improvements that we're needing
56:03 - for this position where and that is how
56:05 - i can improve that position
56:06 - and be an expertise on how i can guide
56:08 - the new joiners in the right direction
56:10 - because i and i can also tell them that
56:12 - as i love teaching uh
56:14 - i have also been teaching educator
56:16 - programmer and as i love teaching
56:17 - i would be happy to to guide the new
56:20 - joiners in the right direction because
56:21 - that is something
56:22 - that i'm passionate about now that is
56:24 - again one social proof
56:26 - right and more then again in the end i
56:28 - say that moreover
56:29 - i look forward to utilize what i learned
56:30 - from here so now what i learned from you
56:32 - there they also they'll know that the
56:34 - things you're gonna be learning from
56:35 - here you're not gonna let it go in with
56:37 - so how are you gonna use them so you can
56:39 - say
56:39 - something like i i will from what i
56:41 - learned from here i i'll try to help
56:43 - other department as well
56:44 - maybe like something like marketing or
56:46 - something like that
56:47 - so then they're like okay this guy is a
56:49 - great team member
56:50 - he's ready he's open-minded to work with
56:52 - other department
56:53 - he's open-minded to uh also guide the
56:57 - new joiners and
56:58 - he specifically wants to improve his
57:01 - role
57:02 - not he wants to go for that managerial
57:04 - position or something like that and
57:05 - probably uh even if you're going for
57:07 - that
57:08 - hide that hide that so well that they
57:10 - don't know like just
57:11 - improve and i think most of the hiring
57:14 - managers would know that
57:15 - definitely did they know that you're not
57:17 - going to stay there for like 10 years
57:18 - for sure but you want to answer it well
57:21 - that they know that
57:22 - you have or you aim to extend the
57:25 - capabilities of that position
57:27 - and you also and how you can do that you
57:29 - can help other department you can help
57:31 - the new joiners
57:32 - and you also show them a social proof
57:34 - that okay i have been working with club
57:35 - program i have been teaching
57:37 - and i can also teach the new joiners
57:38 - once i'm comfortable
57:40 - with this job so daniel go ahead what's
57:43 - what's the key takeaway
57:44 - dude it's it's just a great answer
57:46 - overall like everything just talked on
57:48 - all i could say is screenshot this
57:51 -  slide because it's a great
57:54 - answer guys and i say we now go
57:57 - to the last question of the top eight
58:00 - questions which is the company asking do
58:04 - you have
58:05 - yeah go ahead go ahead do you have any
58:08 - questions
58:10 - for us and here we go what what movies i
58:13 - forgot what movie that's from
58:14 - but yeah they want to see what questions
58:17 - you have right and what is the wrong way
58:19 - to answer this richie
58:23 - most of people would be like i do not
58:25 - have any questions
58:26 - okay that is like that is a wrong wrong
58:29 - question and i think okay at certain
58:31 - level
58:31 - that is okay but that's probably a wrong
58:34 - question you want to avoid that
58:36 - you don't want to show them that you
58:37 - don't have any questions and something
58:39 - else that bothers me a lot
58:40 - is that sometime i'm not saying a lot of
58:42 - people but sometimes
58:44 - some people would be like i have a
58:45 - question what actually does the company
58:47 - do
58:48 - now here if you answer this question
58:50 - like this
58:51 - you are not going to get that job for
58:53 - sure 100
58:55 - because if you ask something like what
58:56 - does that what what actually does the
58:58 - company do they're like
58:59 - holy this guy like he went for it
59:03 - he came to an interview for this company
59:05 - and he did not even did
59:06 - his own research what the hell so you
59:10 - don't want to answer
59:11 - you don't want to ask questions like
59:12 - what the because if you if you are going
59:14 - to an interview probably you should be
59:15 - knowing
59:16 - that uh what does that company does
59:18 - right daniel because even if you're like
59:20 - daniel when you started with blow region
59:22 - you did all your
59:23 - own research right yeah yeah exactly
59:25 - like i knew exactly what the mission of
59:27 - the company was i knew what they were
59:28 - doing
59:29 - what they were hiring for those were the
59:31 - things that i was doing right so
59:33 - i wasn't when they asked me that what
59:36 - were the questions that i had
59:37 - i already had an idea of some questions
59:39 - showing up to the interview because they
59:40 - always ask you like do you have any
59:41 - questions for us
59:42 - so i wasn't afraid to start to ask them
59:45 - questions right
59:46 - and i it wasn't like what does it say no
59:49 - if you're running next to next with
59:50 - another candidate yes
59:51 - so i wasn't afraid to ask questions
59:52 - because i knew i was giving that
59:53 - advantage and knowing more about the
59:54 - position
59:55 - knowing about what they were looking for
59:57 - and positioning myself
59:58 - properly so again i was
60:02 - showing up asking the right questions
60:03 - and i was avoiding this big thing that
60:05 - you want to work which is
60:07 - don't be afraid to not even ask the
60:09 - right questions but don't be afraid to
60:10 - just ask
60:11 - questions in general oh yeah i see them
60:13 - not now she always say the right
60:14 - questions because
60:15 - obviously the other one was a bad
60:17 - question so
60:19 - what are some tips they could do to
60:20 - prepare to ask the right questions
60:22 - richie
60:24 - yeah before we go to the tips like just
60:26 - just to note to make sure
60:28 - that the reason why you want to ask the
60:30 - right questions is
60:31 - because that if you are running neck to
60:34 - neck with another candidate let's say
60:35 - that
60:36 - there is one other guy uh who is there
60:39 - for interview with you and
60:40 - you guys have like done a great job
60:42 - entering and you guys like
60:44 - you guys go like same similar points in
60:46 - that interview
60:47 - and if you ask the right question you
60:50 - will land that job for sure
60:51 - like i guarantee you that that asking
60:53 - the right question will lend you the job
60:55 - if you are running neck to neck with
60:57 - another candidate so so one thing that
60:59 - matters is
61:00 - you all you want to ask you don't want
61:01 - to you don't want to be afraid to write
61:03 - i need uh afraid to ask the question but
61:05 - at the same time
61:06 - you also want to ask the right questions
61:08 - not want to ask like what does company
61:10 - actually do
61:10 - right so that is how uh that that is
61:13 - something that will matter when
61:15 - you are running through a candidate
61:16 - which is like a proper
61:18 - competitor with you now let's talk about
61:21 - some tips
61:21 - how do you answer this question so
61:24 - before you answer that
61:25 - create a list of questions in advance do
61:28 - your own research
61:29 - go to that company's website get the
61:32 - hell out of that website
61:33 - whatever they are looking for go to the
61:35 - job description spend hours looking for
61:37 - the job description
61:38 - figure out what the what kind of person
61:40 - they wants to
61:42 - and go to that company's website figure
61:44 - out like everything
61:45 - that company is doing what are the types
61:47 - of project and based on that
61:49 - figure out like maybe two or three
61:52 - important questions or maybe four
61:54 - important questions that you want to ask
61:55 - them it doesn't matter even if you want
61:57 - to ask questions like that right now we
61:58 - were talking we were just talking with
61:59 - nas before the live stream
62:00 - and he we were talking about this
62:02 - question and he was like uh
62:04 - i think uh probably nas what he used to
62:06 - ask when he was interviewed with google
62:08 - uh twitter and companies like that he
62:10 - also asked questions like
62:12 - what's the team like right uh
62:15 - how does the team work what's the
62:16 - environment like so that kind of
62:18 - questions is necessary because that
62:20 - kind of questions you cannot find on
62:21 - website right but you can always find
62:23 - out like what does the company actually
62:25 - does on the website
62:26 - and that is the reason you don't want to
62:28 - ask questions like that what does the
62:30 - company do and they're like what the
62:31 - hell
62:32 - what does this guy do no no yeah so
62:36 - like you're like are you serious like i
62:38 - swear like people are gonna be like that
62:40 - that
62:40 - uh they're gonna freak out if you don't
62:42 - know about that company when you
62:43 - enter that
62:44 - interview so make sure to do that now so
62:47 - the tip is that create a list of
62:48 - questions in advance like when you go
62:50 - through that company when you go to the
62:51 - description
62:52 - maybe like if they are asking in
62:53 - description they're asking that uh you
62:55 - might also have to
62:56 - uh work on some other technologies so
62:58 - maybe you can have ask questions like
63:00 - what other technologies do i need to
63:02 - work on right so you want to ask that
63:03 - kind of question so but prepare
63:05 - a list in advance so that you don't
63:07 - bluff out at that point
63:09 - now why don't you talk about tip number
63:11 - two daniel go ahead
63:12 - yeah so tip number two is make them feel
63:15 - you want to make sure that you are the
63:17 - right
63:17 - fit again when it's an interview it's
63:20 - not just them seeing if you're right for
63:21 - the company
63:22 - but it's you seeing if you are right fit
63:26 - for that company or for that position
63:29 - so by asking these questions now you're
63:31 - flipping the tables around
63:33 - and you're saying huh okay well like
63:34 - obviously i'm answering these questions
63:36 - super well
63:37 - because i saw richie and daniel's
63:38 - powerpoint so i'm super prepared for
63:40 - these
63:40 - and potentially i'm killing the
63:42 - technical interview questions so
63:44 - obviously i'm a great fit
63:45 - but my question to you company is are
63:48 - you the right fit for me
63:50 - so you flip the tables around and now
63:52 - you're trying to ask those questions
63:54 - that they're gonna be like
63:55 - man we really want this guy and we're
63:56 - gonna try to answer the questions the
63:58 - best of our
63:59 - ability so what's the third tip and the
64:02 - reason
64:02 - why you add on to that yeah before we
64:04 - yeah before we go to the
64:06 - yeah before we go to the third tip the
64:08 - reason why you want to show them you
64:10 - want to make them feel that you
64:12 - also want to make sure you are the right
64:13 - fit because you want to show them that
64:15 - you do care about this job you want to
64:18 - make sure that you are the perfect faith
64:20 - you are not choosing the wrong job and
64:22 - you're just not here for the money
64:24 - even though if you are do not show them
64:26 - and probably i think you won't be but do
64:28 - not show them even if you
64:29 - are but when you when you do that when
64:31 - you ask questions and
64:32 - when you make sure that you are you're
64:34 - right fit from your
64:35 - end for that company they'll be like
64:38 - okay this guy
64:39 - does care about this job that he also
64:42 - wants to make sure
64:43 - he's the right fit and that will make
64:45 - you stand out so this kind of small
64:47 - things that we are gonna
64:48 - we are telling you this kind of small
64:49 - tips make sure you take
64:51 - those notes because that will make you
64:54 - stand out from a lot of candidates it
64:55 - seems that this kind of these are common
64:57 - things
64:57 - but we usually see that people making
64:59 - this common mistakes and
65:01 - uh and it's like it tends to get nervous
65:03 - and they bluff out and it's
65:04 - things get weird in an interview so make
65:07 - sure to
65:08 - take notes of this tip screenshot this
65:10 - and whatever you want
65:12 - but take these tips because it's i think
65:14 - it's pretty interesting and it is based
65:16 - on our experience
65:17 - because we have been interviewed with
65:18 - some companies and the third tip is that
65:21 - show them you are interested in drawing
65:23 - into the role and the company
65:25 - now you also when you're making sure
65:27 - that you're the right fit for the
65:29 - company you also
65:30 - want to show them that you are
65:31 - interested in the role and the company
65:32 - and how you can do that is that
65:34 - you also ask questions like uh maybe the
65:37 - values of the company shares and stuff
65:39 - like that and about even about the role
65:41 - be specific about it like
65:43 - even if you have like uh some questions
65:45 - about a role that okay like if it's
65:46 - reach js developer you're like
65:48 - okay i see that there's uh the role
65:50 - describes that
65:51 - uh if you know uh react native it's an
65:53 - asset so you wanna ask questions like
65:55 - are we gonna be working on mobile
65:57 - applications because it's just a web
65:58 - developer position and that is
66:00 - okay to ask questions like that because
66:03 - that shows you
66:04 - really care about that job you really
66:06 - care about your role and that company
66:08 - and that makes you stand out from a lot
66:10 - of people rather than just answering
66:12 - that
66:12 - no i don't i don't have any questions or
66:15 - uh it's
66:16 - just asking some basic question ask
66:18 - questions related to that role and the
66:20 - company
66:20 - so let's go ahead and daniel read out
66:22 - for them what a right answer
66:24 - looks like so example number one i was
66:27 - doing my own research and i realized
66:29 - that the company is highly focused
66:31 - on building websites and applications
66:34 - for the educational purpose but
66:36 - does the company aim to enhance on other
66:39 - categories
66:40 - as well so you're showing you're
66:43 - interested
66:44 - you're showing that you want to know
66:46 - more about the company
66:47 - and you're also trying to see if they
66:49 - would be that good
66:50 - fit for you what do you want to add to
66:54 - that richie
66:56 - yeah so okay so that is some tricky
66:59 - stuff that
66:59 - that's going on in this answer is that
67:01 - like when you're asking that
67:03 - now the hiring manager gets into mindset
67:05 - that okay this person cares about the
67:06 - role
67:07 - and he's making sure that does the
67:10 - company and hence is to
67:12 - sorry uh and hence to work on other
67:14 - categories as well
67:15 - because uh maybe like you you
67:19 - want to work on other categories as well
67:21 - instead of just educational purpose
67:22 - right so they will be like
67:24 - yeah this person cares about that so
67:26 - that when you ask questions like this
67:28 - that
67:28 - and the one thing that matters in this
67:31 - question
67:32 - in this answer is that they would
67:34 - definitely know that
67:35 - okay awesome this guy knows what the
67:38 - hell we are working right now
67:39 - this guy exactly knows what the hell we
67:41 - are working and he
67:43 - also wants to know what we will be
67:44 - working in future so
67:46 - now you that now the tables have turned
67:48 - they were asking you like what are your
67:49 - goals
67:50 - now you are asking them what are their
67:52 - goals but you're just being more
67:54 - specific
67:55 - and it's completely okay to ask them
67:56 - questions because they want to see how
67:59 - much you care about that job
68:00 - and they want to see you are just not
68:01 - another person who are just here for
68:04 - uh just you just don't want uh you're
68:07 - just a person who just want another job
68:09 - you they want to see that you want to
68:10 - help people you want to help people
68:13 - and you want to make their lives easier
68:16 - in a community who share the same
68:17 - passion for technology
68:19 - right daniel exactly exactly so
68:22 - let's go and head over to example number
68:24 - two and that would read something like
68:26 - apart from the skills listed on my uh
68:29 - cover le or cv
68:30 - curriculum item what other technologies
68:33 - and skills
68:35 - will i get to learn from this
68:38 - role so similar to what rich just talked
68:41 - about which is
68:42 - you're flipping the tables you're trying
68:44 - to see if you're going to be a good fit
68:45 - for them
68:46 - they're going to try to qualify
68:47 - themselves now they're going to try to
68:48 - answer
68:49 - those questions and they're seeing
68:50 - you're interested they're seeing that
68:52 - you're right
68:52 - for the position and they're just trying
68:54 - to see if now they are right for you
68:58 - anything else reaching for sure and when
69:00 - you yeah for sure 100
69:03 - and when you when you show something
69:04 - like this that yeah
69:06 - you are like now the way i think this is
69:09 - something that i think a lot of people
69:10 - should start asking and introduce to the
69:12 - hiring managers because
69:14 - this will this will show them that you
69:16 - are
69:17 - like eager and you are keen to learn new
69:20 - uh new technologies and new skills right
69:22 - so you're asking that apart from the
69:24 - skills listed on my cv so those are the
69:26 - skills that i know
69:27 - what other technologies and skills i
69:29 - will get to learn from this role
69:31 - so not just it's just not one way thing
69:34 - like you
69:34 - it's not just that you are providing
69:36 - them skills you're also asking them what
69:38 - what are the things that i will be
69:39 - learning
69:39 - and definitely it's very good question
69:41 - to ask because uh they will be like okay
69:43 - this guy
69:44 - is like so open-minded he is very smart
69:47 - that he wants to learn from this role as
69:50 - well and
69:50 - he is not he's now when you when you
69:53 - have answered the previous questions
69:54 - just like how we did
69:55 - they're like okay this guy is being
69:56 - honest the uh this guy's
69:58 - uh is not lying he is not proving that
70:00 - he's perfect he has shown his weaknesses
70:03 - and now he's also say he's also showing
70:05 - that he wants to learn
70:07 - now like i think probably no one would
70:09 - like ever
70:10 - wants to not hire this kind of person
70:12 - who is honest
70:13 - who accepts that that person is not
70:15 - perfect who shows the realistic witness
70:18 - who shows the realities realistic
70:20 - strength based on some social proofs and
70:22 - also shows that he wants to improve that
70:24 - weakness and he's working on that
70:26 - weakness
70:26 - and he also wants to learn from that
70:29 - role now i don't think
70:30 - that there will be uh people who would
70:33 - not want to hire this kind of people
70:34 - what's your take
70:36 - yeah no i i mean i completely agree
70:38 - because you're showing
70:40 - why again by asking them questions these
70:43 - type of right questions
70:44 - you're showing them why you are the
70:46 - right fit
70:47 - honestly because again you're putting
70:49 - yourself in that situation where
70:51 - they want you to work for them
70:55 - so richie that was eight
70:58 - of the most common questions right oh
71:00 - we're still on the question one
71:01 - so what else do you want to know richie
71:06 - yeah so uh so one thing to note from
71:09 - here
71:09 - is that don't ask too many questions
71:11 - obviously you want to ask them questions
71:13 - but you don't want to spend like half an
71:15 - hour or hour just asking them questions
71:17 - you want to ask them like three or four
71:19 - questions but just the most
71:20 - relevant questions that will make you
71:22 - stand out and that can
71:23 - that will for sure help you to land that
71:25 - job but do not ask like
71:27 - 15 or 20 questions or even 10 questions
71:30 - and i think that's important because
71:32 - like then hiring managers will be like
71:34 - what the hell is going on this guy is
71:36 - interviewing
71:37 - us yeah because it's not that interview
71:40 - it's your interview
71:44 - and i think uh something else that yeah
71:46 - and you don't want to ask questions like
71:48 - do you pay by check i mean you do care
71:51 - about that stuff i'm not saying that you
71:52 - don't care about that stuff
71:53 - at this point you don't want to ask
71:55 - questions like that do you pay by check
71:57 - are there possibilities of promotions
72:00 - would you would i have to work after
72:01 - hours
72:02 - now like don't ask questions like this
72:04 - at this point and even if you want to
72:06 - ask something like that
72:08 - make sure you phrase that in a more
72:10 - better way that they feel that okay this
72:12 - is relevant not just a random other
72:14 - question
72:15 - so you don't want to do that just don't
72:17 - keep on asking questions
72:19 - one thing i just like realized daniel
72:21 - was that
72:22 - me and daniel guys before we run into
72:24 - bonus me and daniel were like just
72:26 - preparing for this live stream we're
72:27 - doing just testing
72:28 - and then danielle was just doing some
72:30 - testing with nas and then you're like
72:32 - he was testing out the live stream and i
72:34 - was like what the did daniel just
72:36 - go
72:36 - live that was like the funniest thing
72:39 - that ever happened right daniel we're
72:40 - gonna have to show them the bloopers
72:42 - comment comment a thumbs up if you want
72:44 - to see the bloopers of richie panicking
72:46 - because he thought we were going live
72:49 - yeah so i was just like sitting over
72:50 - here and like daniel was just
72:53 - testing out the live stream with all his
72:55 - mic and camera and stuff lighting
72:57 - and he's like uh he's just checking that
72:58 - hey guys this is daniel
73:00 - and it's like uh we have here with us
73:03 - rishi and i'm like i was just sitting
73:04 - over here i'm like
73:05 - what the hell daniel are we alive i
73:07 - didn't even knew
73:09 - daddy i started laughing so hard because
73:11 - you you guys missed that face so comment
73:13 - down
73:14 - thumbs up in the in the chat if you want
73:16 - to see the fire
73:18 - yeah um it was it was like that that was
73:20 - some bad communication on my end because
73:22 - i didn't tell richie we were just
73:23 - testing and that's why communication is
73:25 - important you want to communicate well
73:27 - with the people's interviewing you want
73:28 - to communicate well with your team you
73:29 - want to communicate well
73:31 - with everybody so richie i think it is
73:33 - time for some bonuses
73:34 - so we can make it rain how this meme is
73:37 - making their brain on
73:38 - that i'm the guy in blue and the guy in
73:40 - green is richie
73:41 - [Laughter]
73:44 - so what are some frequently uh questions
73:47 - richie
73:49 - go ahead awesome so uh i think you just
73:52 - went to
73:53 - uh the second question can you just go
73:55 - back is it second order it's the first
73:57 - question
73:57 - well it says okay
74:03 - okay so uh the first question a lot of
74:05 - people would ask
74:07 - us is that should i work unpaid if i
74:09 - have no experience and we get a lot of
74:11 - this kind of question because we have
74:12 - this great community profit with
74:13 - javascript
74:14 - quick clarification richie so these are
74:16 - the frequent questions that people ask
74:18 - us about
74:19 - you know the interview process right not
74:21 - that we're like we're done
74:22 - talking about the interview questions so
74:24 - this is frequently questions of like
74:26 - someone's like hey all right i
74:27 - understand i saw these eight common
74:29 - questions
74:29 - and then they're gonna come with us to
74:31 - these questions so sorry go ahead richie
74:32 - start for interrupting
74:35 - no no no another problem so we get this
74:37 - kind of questions in our community we

75:22 - that on your resume put that project on
75:24 - your resume and go for that job
75:26 - now let's focus on the question we get
75:29 - a lot of should i work unpaid if i have
75:32 - no experience
75:33 - i think for it it completely depends
75:36 - like i
75:37 - i think i have seen a lot of people who
75:39 - says that no no no
75:40 - there's always a value for your skills
75:42 - in the market i think
75:43 - when you are starting out when you have
75:46 - zero experience
75:47 - and uh when you do not have uh when
75:49 - you're just starting out
75:50 - i would say work for free that doesn't
75:52 - matter because i think when even when i
75:53 - was talking with nas
75:55 - when he graduated from his high school
75:56 - he was working with a sarah for free and
75:58 - i think that's not a bad thing what's
76:00 - your take on that
76:01 - yeah i mean i worked a lot for free
76:03 - because in the beginning
76:04 - i didn't have the experience and i
76:06 - wanted to get the experience so i was
76:07 - willing to put in the time
76:08 - i was willing to put in the effort the
76:10 - blood the sweat the tears all of those
76:12 - things
76:13 - absolutely for free but that allowed me
76:14 - to start to build momentum that allowed
76:16 - me to start to build experience
76:17 - then once i actually had those skills i
76:19 - could charge people whether that was
76:21 - through job or freelancing
76:22 - or whatever that can be
76:26 - yes and so now if you're talking about
76:28 - this when you're working when you're a
76:30 - beginner when you're just starting out
76:31 - and the reason why i can be the perfect
76:33 - person to advise you because
76:34 - i started two years back and i know this
76:36 - even when you're a beginner and when
76:38 - you're starting out
76:39 - like you should work for free because at
76:42 - that point
76:42 - you don't want to work for money
76:46 - you want to work for knowledge in
76:48 - exchange of
76:49 - you want to work there in exchange of
76:50 - knowledge and skills
76:52 - now i think the one advice i would on my
76:55 - end
76:55 - and i have i have been a big fan of tom
76:57 - billow and uh
76:58 - i have this is something he says that
77:01 - like one advice he would
77:03 - or probably even i would give to someone
77:05 - who is just starting out is that
77:07 - like if you're starting out just find
77:09 - the find the
77:10 - find a person you aspire you you inspire
77:13 - you get inspired from that person
77:14 - and who is your idol like if you want to
77:16 - be like someone
77:17 - find it out whom you can contact go to
77:20 - that person
77:21 - tell them that i will work for you for
77:24 - three months or probably two months
77:26 - and i promise you that i will be the
77:28 -  best person that you will have
77:30 - ever came across
77:31 - even if i'm working for free and i
77:33 - promise that i will never let you down
77:35 - even if i'm working for free and at the
77:37 - end of that two or three months
77:39 - if you feel that if you want to pay me
77:41 - we are good i will be a team member and
77:42 - if you feel that if you
77:44 - if you don't want to pay me we shake
77:46 - hands but in exchange
77:47 - we share knowledge and connections right
77:50 - daniel and i think that is one of the
77:52 - most important thing and that is the
77:53 - reason
77:53 - you want to work for free for knowledge
77:55 - and connections and connections matters
77:57 - a lot
77:58 - right daniel exactly once you build that
78:00 - skill you could definitely
78:02 - say no and start charging and making
78:04 - sure that you're getting
78:06 - paid so with that being said let's go to
78:09 - the second question we get which is
78:11 - does reference matters what are your
78:14 - thoughts richie
78:17 - completely i think um 90 percent or
78:20 - maybe like not 90
78:22 - that's a huge skill that i just said
78:23 - maybe 70 to 80 percent of the job
78:26 - that people get it's because of the
78:27 - reference that's what i believe like
78:29 - even though they have the posting on
78:30 - those websites
78:32 - excuse me so the reference matters a lot
78:35 - because even when i'm trying out
78:37 - like if i have a friend if i know a
78:39 - person
78:41 - sorry who is working in that company i
78:43 - would just reach out to that person and
78:45 - i would be like
78:46 - hey bro like hey daniel i see that
78:48 - you're working in blue origin and
78:50 - i was wondering that i have i have been
78:52 - doing a couple of stuff in the past
78:54 - and i can send you my resume and i would
78:56 - be i would really appreciate if
78:57 - if you can get me an interview in blue
78:59 - origin and but at the same time you need
79:01 - to show danielle that why you are
79:02 - responsible because
79:03 - if daniel is taking the responsibility
79:05 - of mine to get me an interview he wants
79:07 - to make sure that i
79:08 - am a smart person so you want to show
79:10 - that person and i think
79:12 - and that is reference matters a lot and
79:14 - reference will
79:15 - will get you a lot of interest now one
79:17 - tip what you can do with reference like
79:20 - if you don't have reference
79:21 - if you want to build up like that is
79:22 - something i i learned from nas
79:24 - is that like uh if you are in that city
79:26 - like let's say
79:27 - that in usa you are in new york and you
79:30 - studied from uh
79:31 - uh the new york state university or
79:33 - whatever
79:34 - nyu uh so you want what you want to do
79:38 - is that you want to go to linkedin you
79:40 - you first of all you guys need to have a
79:41 - good linkedin profile
79:43 - strong linkedin profile so you want to
79:44 - go to linkedin and if you don't have
79:45 - connections
79:46 - just like if you and in new york if you
79:48 - have the headquarters let's say for
79:50 - example for a company and you want to
79:51 - apply to that company
79:52 - go to linkedin and there are filters so
79:54 - what you want to do is go to filter and
79:55 - select
79:56 - nyu and that company in that filter now
79:59 - linkedin is going to show you all the
80:00 - people
80:01 - from your college and from uh that come
80:04 - who are working in that company now what
80:06 - you can do is like
80:07 - reach out to at least five five people
80:09 - that hey bro uh i was in your comp uh i
80:11 - was in your college i we i graduated
80:14 - from uh
80:14 - the same college you graduated and i
80:16 - would really appreciate you if you can
80:17 - help me on few things that i'm looking
80:18 - for a job
80:19 - and i think out of five people at least
80:21 - two people would be happy to help you
80:23 - what's what's your take daniel
80:25 - yeah exactly and the reason uh richie's
80:27 - saying that is because
80:28 - in the end it's not about what you know
80:30 - it's about who you know when you start
80:31 - to network with people when you start to
80:32 - connect with the right people
80:34 - you are going to have the right
80:36 - references to land the right job so
80:39 - again it's not about what you know
80:41 - it's about who you know and maybe you're
80:42 - not happy with that but too bad that's
80:44 - the reality of life if there's two
80:46 - people that
80:47 - you know have the same skills but one of
80:49 - them has a reference in that company the
80:50 - other one doesn't
80:51 - honestly don't want the reference is
80:52 - going to get the job because they
80:54 - already understand or at least one
80:55 - person inside the company
80:56 - or understands how the other person
80:59 - works or they already have that
81:01 - like he said he takes that
81:02 - responsibility of taking it upon himself
81:03 - to help that person
81:05 - get that interview so it's absolutely
81:07 - important to understand
81:09 - who you know and references do matter is
81:11 - there anything else you want to add to
81:12 - this one yeah and when
81:14 - yes yes yes definitely and i think one
81:16 - thing that i would add is that
81:18 - when you are getting a job because of a
81:19 - reference let's say i get in get into
81:21 - blue origin
81:22 - uh because of daniel then if i if i get
81:25 - a job i don't want to let daniel down i
81:26 - don't want to quit the job in one week
81:28 - then it's going to create a very
81:29 - negative impression on daniel i don't
81:31 - want to be like a jerk who don't work
81:33 - who don't
81:33 - submit everything on deadline i because
81:35 - if i i have been referred by daniel
81:37 - it's his responsibility for probably not
81:40 - directly but indirectly it's his
81:41 - responsibility so when you join a job
81:43 - because of someone make sure you don't
81:44 - let them down
81:46 - exactly exactly so if you get the
81:49 - reference
81:50 - don't let them down now the next faq
81:53 - should i
81:53 - lie in my interview and here we got the
81:58 - classic friends joey saying
82:00 - don't you lie to me all right why should
82:02 - they not lie to me richie i think this
82:04 - is pretty obvious but go ahead and tell
82:06 - them why they should not lie
82:10 - because i uh hiding managers are trained
82:14 - of catching lives uh they see in your
82:17 - eyes they're gonna have like even when
82:19 - you're talking to hiding man just
82:20 - see them in in their eyes and they're
82:22 - like they're like so good at catching
82:24 - the lies like if you're gonna say that
82:25 - i'm perfect they'll just catch it and
82:26 - it's just basic questions that
82:28 - they'll like catch your lies in seconds
82:30 - i'm not saying that you should uh
82:32 - completely not lie you might want to
82:33 - hide few things that you don't want to
82:35 - show them
82:36 - that is not relevant but you should
82:38 - never lie in your interview if you don't
82:40 - know some skills
82:41 - like let's say if you don't know uh
82:43 - bootstrap and react
82:44 - just be honest that uh there is one
82:47 - thing that i do not know from the skills
82:48 - but i'm eager to learn
82:50 - because everyone knows over here that
82:52 - like probably if i own a company or
82:54 - probably if someone even just think
82:55 - about that
82:56 - if you own a company if you're looking
82:57 - for a job would you expect that person
82:59 - to be perfect
83:00 - no because no one can be perfect so do
83:03 - not ever lie
83:04 - in your interview never ever do that try
83:07 - to hide few things that are not relevant
83:09 - but that's not same thing as lying
83:11 - yeah it's not even hiding just just
83:12 - don't talk about what you do but no no
83:14 - it's
83:14 - it's all the clear don't lie be honest
83:16 - be transparent nobody likes liars if you
83:18 - lie get the out of here
83:20 - next question what if i mess up in my
83:22 - interview
83:24 - oh man richie i went to my interview i
83:26 - screwed it up
83:27 - i feel bad about myself blah blah blah
83:29 - blah blah
83:30 - poor me what are you gonna tell this
83:32 - person richie when they ask you this
83:33 - question
83:36 - i think uh it's it's this person was me
83:39 - when i started because like when i got
83:41 - when i said
83:41 - when i got some rejections from my
83:43 - interviews and i feel like
83:45 - what then they asked me like some
83:46 - questions and then i mess up and then i
83:48 - block out
83:49 - and then when i messed up i'm like when
83:50 - i closed when i'm done with it i'm like
83:52 - holy what the hell like what kind
83:54 - of person i am to answer a question like
83:57 - that that i'm perfect i don't have any
83:59 - weakness and it's like if you mess up in
84:01 - any
84:02 - in your interviews that is okay because
84:05 - you go through several interviews to
84:07 - land that one
84:08 - job it's okay like you but the key thing
84:11 - is that
84:12 - you learn from every single interview
84:14 - you learn from like if you if you make a
84:16 - mistake uh
84:17 - in that interview and if you keep on
84:19 - repeating that mistake
84:20 - then you are not growing then you should
84:23 - care then you should worry about that
84:25 - but if you just make a when you're a
84:26 - beginner and when you when you mess up
84:28 - in terms
84:29 - that's completely okay no one cares like
84:32 - okay what's the worst case scenario
84:34 - and uh they won't hire you that's okay
84:36 - like
84:37 - i mean still there are hundreds and
84:40 - thousands of jobs waiting for you so
84:42 - don't worry about that just keep your
84:44 - high hopes
84:45 - and but write it down from write it down
84:48 - in a piece of paper that
84:49 - what mistakes you made in that interview
84:51 - now
84:52 - once you have the list of the mistakes
84:54 - work on that mistakes
84:55 - and that's how you kill that next
84:57 - interview you go for in the first
84:59 - interview you make like four mistakes
85:01 - you write in a piece of paper
85:02 - and you try you try to improve that you
85:04 - go to the next interview
85:06 - out of four in the next interview make
85:07 - only two mistakes in the next winter you
85:09 - make one and there will be one interview
85:11 - that will be perfect and then you'll
85:13 - start just killing out
85:14 - so don't worry if you mess up in the
85:16 - interviews that's completely okay you're
85:18 - a human
85:20 - exactly exactly so if you ask us what if
85:22 - i mess up in my interviews i'm gonna say
85:25 - good learn from it don't do it again
85:28 - next question all right what is a super
85:31 - trick to write those
85:33 - big and impressive words on your resume
85:35 - so that
85:36 - when the person reviewing the resume the
85:38 - person
85:39 - interviewing you is going to have this
85:40 - exact same face of shock
85:42 - and amazement and they're going to want
85:44 - to hire you right on the spot
85:46 - richie what we got for them
85:50 - i think this is like a trick that i'm
85:52 - not sure i have seen this post i won't
85:54 - take the credit for this i have seen
85:56 - this post on uh
85:57 - instagram or linkedin by some guy and
85:59 - that guy has a very good trick because
86:01 - like when you're
86:02 - beginning like when i when i started my
86:04 - career like when i had to write that
86:06 - resume i was like
86:07 - holy like when i asked for people
86:08 - like nas and
86:10 - you and that can you guys send me a
86:11 - resume and when i see your resume like
86:14 - nasa's resume and i'm like holy
86:16 - how does this guy have this much of
86:17 - vocabulary like those words are amazing
86:20 - like
86:20 - reduce the productivity by 80 percent uh
86:24 - and reduce the errors and stuff like
86:27 - that like those big questions
86:28 - so how do you write those big impressive
86:31 - words in your resume when you're
86:32 - starting out it's so hard when you're
86:33 - beginning you don't know
86:34 - so go ahead daniel next to the next
86:36 - screen and i will explain them how they
86:38 - can do that
86:39 - go ahead richie so
86:42 - the first thing you want to do is like
86:44 - go to google go to dr google
86:46 - and search for the top 10 jobs from
86:50 - those big companies
86:51 - for the specific position you're looking
86:53 - for let's say you're looking for web
86:54 - developer or let's say you're looking
86:55 - for software developer
86:57 - position so go to google and search for
86:59 - software developer
87:00 - in facebook now you go to the facebook
87:03 - page you go through the descriptions
87:05 - and you figure out like don't just go to
87:08 - facebook go to tesla go to microsoft go
87:10 - to google
87:11 - different kinds of those big companies
87:13 - that have posting
87:14 - go to that join 10 jobs for software
87:16 - developer now
87:18 - read the description the second thing
87:19 - you want to do is first thing is search
87:21 - photos job second thing is read the
87:23 - descriptions and find out
87:25 - 15 to 20 impressive words from those
87:27 - description
87:28 - you can definitely find out more than
87:29 - that but i'm just going to say 15 to 20
87:32 - those have that impressive words because
87:34 - they always because this company
87:35 - always this kind of big companies they
87:37 - always focus on marketing good so they
87:39 - will always have that
87:40 - clean fancy words on their description
87:42 - so pick out 15 to 20 impressive words
87:45 - paste that in a google document and use
87:48 - now use those in your resume now when
87:50 - you're using that
87:51 - don't forcefully use that just try to
87:53 - figure out a sentence where you can use
87:55 - that just
87:56 - you don't want to use a word that's just
87:58 - um
88:00 - uh that's just not relevant
88:03 - at that time in your resume so make sure
88:05 - you also use third words which are
88:06 - relevant so out of 15 to 20 even if you
88:08 - use like five to ten
88:10 - that's okay so what's what's your take
88:12 - like what do you think about district
88:13 - daniel

88:16 - start to do and
88:17 - up your resume game basically right
88:19 - because you want to make sure that
88:20 - you know you're not just writing at a
88:22 - first grade level with like
88:24 - like talking like donald trump or
88:25 - whatever right you want to make sure
88:26 - that you can
88:28 - properly communicate your ideas through
88:30 - words through text and when they see the
88:32 - resume they can get an understanding so
88:34 - i think these are some
88:35 - amazing great tips so
88:39 - super trick to land jobs 10
88:42 - times faster is there anything you want
88:44 - to say before i go into the super trick
88:46 - richie in the next slide
88:49 - no no no no it's gonna be a very good
88:52 - day for you guys to make sure you
88:53 - take notes of this kind of tips but
88:56 - let's go to the next slide bro
88:58 - do it
89:01 - go ahead okay awesome so yep
89:04 - uh awesome it's just uh
89:08 - the last slide for me
89:11 - okay it's gonna be some lag because of
89:12 - youtube but sorry no no
89:14 - it's fine now i think it's just it might
89:16 - be the lag or something
89:18 - but uh yeah so uh first thing you wanna
89:21 - do
89:22 - is that read the description of that job
89:24 - 10 times
89:25 - now the reason why i'm saying this is
89:26 - this trick that
89:28 - uh i i was just uh i went to toronto to
89:31 - one of my relatives and
89:33 - he is a senior software developer and he
89:36 - also sits with a hiring manager when
89:37 - they're hiring developers
89:39 - when they're hiring junior developers
89:40 - because he also lead a team and he knows
89:42 - like what kind of developers they want
89:44 - so
89:44 - he told me this trick because he also
89:46 - sits with those hiring managers when
89:48 - they're entering people
89:48 - so this is the trick first of all read
89:51 - the description of that job
89:53 - ten times even if it takes four hours or
89:56 - even if it takes five hours
89:57 - that's okay it won't probably take four
89:59 - hours it would take probably one hour
90:01 - but read the description of that job ten
90:03 - times like
90:04 - figure out what kind of person they are
90:06 - looking for like what kind of exact
90:08 - person
90:09 - they are looking for second thing is
90:11 - figure out the code relation between
90:13 - you and that jobs responsibilities
90:16 - now you this is very important when you
90:19 - figure out a direct connection between
90:20 - you and that job
90:22 - then 90 chance that you will get the job
90:24 - for sure because
90:25 - you have a reason uh that they should
90:28 - hire
90:28 - you because you are directly connected
90:30 - to that job
90:31 - the third thing that is use those and
90:35 - make a resume and cv that has
90:38 - exactly all the qualities required for
90:40 - that job
90:41 - now the first thing is when you when you
90:43 - read the description you figure out that
90:45 - what kind of person what kind of
90:47 - uh what are the requirements of that job
90:50 - and then based on those recommend you
90:52 - make a resume
90:53 - which makes you an ideal candidate for
90:56 - that job
90:57 - like you have all the skills that are
90:59 - listed or probably if you know all the
91:00 - skills put down all the skills if you
91:02 - don't know all the skill
91:03 - uh maybe uh just don't put that skill
91:06 - but
91:06 - let's say let's say 90 of the skill and
91:08 - uh if they're looking for a web
91:10 - developer you have all the projects on
91:11 - your resume
91:12 - that consists of all the websites you
91:15 - made and
91:16 - and then apply for that job so then
91:19 - if you have a perfect resume and cv and
91:22 - that
91:23 - that and there's a human connection
91:25 - right they will feel that
91:26 - okay i see his description in his uh
91:29 - cover letter and i feel that this guy
91:31 - would be ideal candidate for this job so
91:33 - these are the four steps you want to do
91:35 - with the job description
91:36 - figure out the correlation between you
91:38 - and that uh that job
91:39 - use that to make a resume in cv and then
91:42 - apply for that job and i swear
91:44 - that this will help you to get that job
91:46 - like 10x faster than a normal
91:49 - uh normally because you just probably
91:51 - what all people would do is that they
91:52 - would just use the same resume and apply
91:54 - to like hundreds of jobs
91:55 - right daniel what's your take hold on
92:01 - bless you thank you yes i agree if you
92:04 - do these four steps you're gonna stand
92:05 - out because no one else is doing these
92:07 - things
92:08 - like if you are the one guy out of 100
92:10 - people who does this
92:11 - you're going to stand out you're going
92:13 - to get the job you're going to get the
92:14 - interview
92:15 - if you do these things that we talked
92:16 - about you're going to crush that
92:18 - interview
92:18 - and you're going to land your job as a
92:21 - developer freelancer or working in
92:23 - corporate america
92:24 - whatever that may be so do these four
92:26 - steps take another screenshot
92:27 - go you know go through this whole thing
92:29 - again to know exactly what
92:31 - you need to answer for every single
92:35 - thing so give them that tip
92:38 - in this last part richie
92:42 - yep awesome sorry
92:46 - so the tip is that uh this is a great
92:48 - tip that i realize
92:50 - so if you are all so always always have
92:53 - a local address
92:55 - if you are applying to a different city
92:57 - or province
92:58 - so let's say that uh i live in uh in
93:00 - canada i live in ottawa
93:02 - and i want to apply for a job in
93:04 - vancouver and
93:05 - so what happens is that uh when you send
93:09 - out their resume
93:10 - you probably have an address that you
93:12 - live right now so i would probably have
93:13 - an address that i live right now that is
93:14 - uh for ottawa
93:16 - and when i apply to that job they would
93:18 - first consider a person who is in
93:20 - vancouver so what you want to do is that
93:22 - figure out
93:22 - uh figure out if you have a connection
93:24 - in vancouver and
93:26 - uh tell them that hey bro i just want to
93:28 - use your address on my resume now this
93:30 - is not a bad thing that's completely
93:31 - okay because they personal
93:33 - most of the times they hire local people
93:34 - because that that has happened to me
93:36 - like applied to a job in category and
93:38 - then uh those people
93:40 - would really like my resume they had an
93:42 - injury but they told me that they are
93:43 - looking for someone
93:44 - who is local over here because then
93:47 - i also told them that i can move but
93:49 - still it's not gonna work out so
93:50 - they always gonna want someone who is
93:53 - local so this is a very good team
93:55 - always always always use the local
93:57 - address of that city or province you are
93:59 - applying for
94:00 - awesome so that's the tip and that's the
94:03 - last tip we wanted to give you
94:05 - and i think uh one note
94:08 - you can take from here yeah you can take
94:10 - from
94:11 - the here is that different job requires
94:14 - different resume and cv
94:16 - like you cannot just apply with the same
94:18 - resume in cv for every job
94:20 - if it's like a react job you can you
94:21 - would have to show some react skills and
94:23 - react project if it's a javascript then
94:25 - you would have to show javascript plain
94:27 - javascript
94:27 - but it requires different resume a
94:30 - different cv for every job don't use the
94:32 - same ones
94:32 - make some changes to that so i think uh
94:36 - that is all from me and daniel we
94:38 - created this presentation for you guys
94:40 - and i hope you guys enjoyed the top
94:42 - eight common questions and i i think
94:44 - now you guys have a better understanding
94:47 - of uh
94:48 - what uh understanding how you can answer
94:51 - those questions in a better way and it's
94:54 - okay if you have joined right now
94:55 - if you have missed it just go back and
94:57 - start screenshoting those answers
94:59 - write down in a piece of paper practice
95:01 - it but
95:02 - make sure that when you're answering
95:04 - those they should not feel that
95:06 - you are just like uh reading a written
95:08 - text
95:09 - be natural when you're answering that
95:11 - pre
95:12 - get prepared for that obviously uh uh
95:15 - but
95:15 - don't be 100 natural don't be uh
95:18 - someone who just read something that is
95:20 - written in a piece of paper so you also
95:22 - want to make sure about that
95:24 - so i hope you enjoyed that and i think
95:26 - uh if you uh we
95:28 - we would take some questions at this
95:30 - point so guys if you have like any
95:32 - questions
95:33 - uh please drop it in the comments and
95:35 - before you are dropping it
95:36 - uh i just want to say that the people
95:38 - who have joined right now
95:39 - um we have organized a free netflix
95:43 - clone training for you
95:44 - that's completely free go sign up the
95:48 - link is in the description
95:49 - and it's completely free get that
95:51 - project on your portfolio
95:52 - so i think one question daniel uh i got
95:55 - i i realized that
95:56 - uh that i we need to answer is that
95:59 - there was a guy who asked like it was
96:00 - couple of times back
96:01 - that a person asked that uh do you need
96:04 - a degree to
96:05 - get a job in web developer what's your
96:07 - take daniel
96:08 - you do not need a degree to get a job as
96:10 - a web developer
96:12 - what you need is experience so sometimes
96:14 - a degree can get you some experience
96:16 - but other times going to clever
96:18 - programmer and
96:19 - building a netflix clone could get you
96:21 - the experience you need
96:23 - to be able to land your first job so you
96:26 - do not need a degree
96:27 - a degree might help be helpful for some
96:29 - people depending on your situation if
96:31 - you're not
96:32 - one of those people that can go out
96:33 - there and learn by yourself or if you're
96:35 - not
96:35 - willing to you know put the time in with
96:37 - clever programmer to learn the right
96:38 - applications
96:39 - and it might be worth going to school so
96:41 - that someone could tell you how to do it
96:43 - and what to do but even then that's not
96:44 - guaranteed
96:45 - because in the end what's guaranteed is
96:46 - experience so even if you go to school
96:48 - and go get your degree
96:49 - make sure you're getting that experience
96:50 - make sure you're building out the
96:51 - portfolio make sure you're building out
96:53 - projects
96:54 - and getting your hands dirty so that you
96:55 - actually show your problem
96:57 - solver is there anything you want to add
96:58 - to that richie
97:01 - awesome so uh i think no that's a very
97:04 - good explanation i don't think that you
97:06 - need a degree to get a job in web
97:07 - developer because
97:08 - i think most of the successful
97:09 - developers are self-educated so i don't
97:11 - think you need
97:13 - that i think another question another
97:15 - important question we have from here is
97:16 - from nikhil
97:17 - nikhil satis he says that what is a role
97:21 - of a portfolio
97:22 - website for a developer i think it's
97:25 - mandatory nowadays uh i think even a lot
97:28 - of people have started asking like when
97:30 - you go and apply for a job
97:31 - for jobs in north america uh most of the
97:33 - companies have started asking for a link
97:35 - that is for about your portfolio because
97:38 - the reason why they ask this because
97:39 - you cannot show them everything on a
97:41 - resume you cannot have a 10 page resume
97:43 - explaining everything you do right you
97:45 - can have only one page resume
97:47 - and a cover letter and then you link
97:49 - them to portfolio
97:50 - that shows all your projects that you
97:52 - have done in previous that shows all
97:54 - other stuff like whatever you want to
97:55 - show them
97:56 - but i think it's very mandatory right
97:58 - now and uh
97:59 - that will also make you stand out from a
98:01 - lot of people so i think it's mandatory
98:03 - right now
98:06 - so yep uh i think uh if you guys have
98:09 - more questions uh so
98:10 - there is one guy who asked that is it
98:13 - important to have a degree of engineer
98:15 - uh for computer science so as as daniel
98:18 - said that
98:18 - it's not necessary it's all about
98:21 - experience so get your experience like
98:23 - start building those projects
98:24 - like my advice if you're a beginner my
98:26 - advice would be like if if you don't
98:28 - have a degree and if you're a beginner
98:29 - my advice would be like start investing
98:32 - in yourself with those ten dollars or
98:34 - fifteen dollars
98:35 - instead of going into that ten dollars
98:37 - or fifteen dollars courses start
98:38 - investing in yourself
98:40 - like if the more you invest like i
98:41 - understand like if you don't wanna go
98:43 - for that like
98:44 - even if it's like start hiring a mentor
98:46 - even if it's not me even if it's not
98:47 - anybody but not
98:48 - now start hiring mentors and if you have
98:50 - that budget go sign up for a profit with
98:52 - javascript course
98:53 - and and even if you don't want to buy
98:56 - that course
98:56 - there are going to be a lot of free
98:58 - resources like just stay tuned with
98:59 - clear programmer we are providing some
99:01 - value bombs we are building some amazing
99:03 - clones
99:04 - so uh you can definitely learn from that
99:06 - but the key point is
99:08 - keep on learning and keep on having that
99:10 - uh practical experience instead of just
99:12 - going to the theoretical experience and
99:14 - also work for free even if you have to
99:16 - like in the beginning
99:17 - exactly that's how you can get that
99:18 - experience see we have another question
99:20 - which is
99:20 - how to connect with people in linkedin
99:22 - out of 100 people only 10
99:24 - respond so richie gave a great tip which
99:27 - nas gave him
99:28 - which is find people who have gone to
99:30 - your university
99:32 - and then request friendship from them
99:35 - because usually because there's that
99:36 - connection of hey we went to the same
99:37 - school
99:38 - and they work at some spot that i want
99:40 - to work on they're more than
99:41 - likely to say yes but you can start to
99:44 - get creative don't just spam
99:46 - everyone be creative ask for people that
99:48 - happen to be
99:49 - in the company want to work at or ask
99:51 - for people that have that same
99:53 - common uh work experience or school
99:56 - experience or whatever that may be is
99:57 - there anything else you want to add to
99:58 - that richie
100:00 - no no for sure 100 so i think yeah yeah
100:03 - go for it
100:05 - awesome
100:09 - yeah so i think there is a guy who says
100:12 - that
100:13 - uh what projects do you recommend for a
100:15 - back-end developer
100:16 - i would say that for a weekend developer
100:18 - do projects that are
100:19 - that we are building right now with uh
100:22 - sunny we also built an amazon clone and
100:24 - we will be soon releasing an
100:26 - amazon clone whole big tutorial uh
100:29 - and there are a lot of things that you
100:30 - can do but even if you're a backend
100:32 - developer
100:32 - try to even if you're backing up front
100:35 - end doesn't matter
100:36 - when you when you applying for a job
100:38 - don't have that projects like
100:41 - uh calculator and a small website and
100:44 - stuff like that
100:44 - i think it's good i'm not saying that
100:46 - you should not build that it's good when
100:48 - you're learning
100:48 - but don't expect a job based on those
100:52 - projects
100:53 - how does real projects like
100:55 - amazon clone if it's spotify clone or
100:57 - something like that
100:58 - and even in amazon clone we have built
101:00 - the whole uh
101:01 - back end and front end where we had the
101:02 - challenge so build projects like that
101:04 - instead of just having those small
101:06 - projects it doesn't matter what projects
101:07 - you build
101:09 - exactly
101:14 - i'm just looking for another job so
101:15 - there's a guy uh atishai jane
101:18 - he says that from where can i start the
101:20 - freelancer job
101:22 - so there are different platforms that
101:23 - you can go to start your freelancer
101:25 - so i first thing i would recommend is
101:28 - that uh
101:29 - do not go to upwork because it is
101:31 - something that you want to transition
101:33 - after you are professional
101:35 - first go with freelancer.com and maybe
101:38 - if you
101:38 - if you want to go with fiverr fiverr is
101:40 - a great website as well it's picking up
101:42 - right now
101:42 - so uh you can go with fiverr as well and
101:45 - it's freelancer.com
101:47 - but even when you're when you're
101:48 - freelancing you need to learn a lot of
101:50 - stuff
101:51 - just make sure that the initial two or
101:53 - three months is gonna be hard
101:54 - because uh you don't know how to reach
101:56 - out to clients you don't know how to bid
101:58 - on
101:58 - projects so it's gonna be hard but make
102:01 - sure to invest and
102:02 - learn all those stuff once you learn it
102:03 - it's gonna be like this
102:13 - any other questions richie or is that it
102:16 - so uh yeah so nikhil has uh another
102:19 - question as well
102:20 - that uh you did talk about a local
102:22 - address now how do i actually
102:24 - show a local address like of course i'm
102:26 - gonna just relocate there based on
102:28 - getting the job or not
102:29 - how do i show a local address so
102:31 - probably and there was a guy even uh
102:33 - he said that you guys said that you
102:36 - should not lie in uh
102:37 - in your interview and uh you are saying
102:40 - that
102:40 - you should add a local address so that's
102:42 - that's probably like so it is not lying
102:45 - we did not say it is not like you're
102:47 - you're putting up a local address you
102:49 - it's not like you're probably gonna move
102:50 - there so it's not lying
102:52 - it's completely okay it's gonna increase
102:53 - your chances it's just that
102:55 - you're putting up address and then
102:57 - nickel answering your questions
102:59 - uh just find out someone who lives in
103:01 - that city
103:02 - probably you can definitely find out
103:03 - someone who can live who lives in that
103:05 - city
103:05 - so i think that's how you can do that uh
103:08 - yeah i don't think there's another way
103:09 - you can do it
103:10 - and honestly if you can't then there's
103:12 - no big deal just put your address and
103:13 - then
103:14 - you know i mean you just don't get that
103:15 - extra advantage of if that company
103:17 - happens to be looking for someone local
103:18 - but
103:19 - if you look if you try to apply for big
103:21 - tech they don't give a what city
103:22 - you live in right i mean that's only
103:24 - more like a local
103:25 - little company so don't even stress
103:27 - about it i mean if you can find someone
103:28 - and they're comfortable with it
103:30 - sure go ahead and do it if not then who
103:32 - cares like it's not a big issue it's
103:33 - just a little extra tip
103:35 - and then in terms of again the point
103:37 - about lang if
103:38 - i mean if you're not going to relocate
103:39 - then yeah that's i mean then don't do
103:42 - that
103:42 - right but if you're willing to relocate
103:45 - then you can just
103:46 - go ahead and do that like there's
103:47 - there's really no harm because
103:49 - you're just putting yourself that extra
103:50 - little advantage that
103:52 - that it's like if they search locally
103:54 - you get
103:55 - they're gonna look they're gonna find
103:56 - your portfolio
103:59 - yep yep and uh there is a guy priyanshu
104:02 - sheriff i believe he's uh he's in pwg as
104:05 - well
104:05 - and he says that he's asking that which
104:07 - is the best platform for tutoring
104:09 - so uh for i think i believe that what
104:12 - he's asking that what is the best
104:14 - platform from
104:15 - where he can start teaching people i
104:17 - think there are a lot of
104:18 - a lot of platforms where you can start
104:20 - tutoring
104:21 - but uh personally i think that
104:25 - uh there are a lot of website but
104:26 - personally what you can do is that
104:28 - you can reach out to people on facebook
104:30 - just go to just find in the search bar
104:32 - just go to like just type html css and
104:35 - javascript if that is what you want to
104:36 - teach
104:37 - go to those group those groups make sure
104:39 - those groups don't allow promotion
104:40 - so go to those groups figure out what
104:43 - people are
104:44 - looking for those tutors like they're
104:45 - not going to be direct that i'm looking
104:46 - for a tutor they're gonna be like
104:48 - uh i want to learn html css what are the
104:50 - best resources
104:51 - they might ask questions like this so
104:53 - reach out to them personally
104:55 - do not comment on that or something like
104:57 - that or maybe even if
104:58 - comment on that and help them out and
105:01 - then when you provide them on value
105:03 - reach out to them personally direct
105:05 - message them and
105:06 - have a marketing message something like
105:08 - hey if you are facing
105:10 - problems with building website with html
105:12 - css javascript i can help you
105:14 - but first like provide them a free call
105:17 - and if they feel that it's valuable then
105:19 - they would take
105:20 - uh uh call tutoring with you but i think
105:23 - that is something that i know and i have
105:24 - used in past
105:26 - but there are i believe there are a
105:27 - couple of websites that also does that
105:29 - so if you if you think that you want to
105:30 - do that on high scale
105:32 - go for it i think in the one video kazi
105:34 - also talks about those tutoring
105:36 - uh uh websites and i think it's it's
105:38 - with uh
105:39 - sunny that he talks about i'm not just
105:42 - sure what
105:43 - do is that cool
105:48 - i think so uh the last question we can
105:51 - answer is that asuria saxena
105:53 - she says that uh algorithm and data
105:56 - structures knowledge is necessary to
105:58 - correct coding interviews
105:59 - what what do you say daniel on that it
106:02 - depends on who you're interviewing with
106:03 - you're going to interview with big tech
106:05 - like google microsoft and all those
106:06 - things yes
106:07 - you do need to know the big technical
106:09 - algorithm type interviews because that's
106:11 - gonna be a big part
106:12 - but very often if you're just gonna
106:13 - interview at a local company sometimes
106:15 - they really don't even ask that they
106:16 - just care about the stuff that we talked
106:18 - about
106:18 - today which is showing your experience
106:21 - making sure that you're a nice person to
106:22 - talk with that you're gonna fight well
106:24 - with the team and they're gonna love
106:26 - working with you and they might not even
106:27 - ask you a single algorithm question so
106:30 - reality depends
106:31 - where you want to apply to and where
106:33 - you're trying to get some jobs
106:36 - yep and just to add to that i had one of
106:39 - my friends she was
106:40 - my classmate and one thing that
106:42 - fascinated me was she got a job as a
106:45 - web developer and in toronto and
106:48 - that person that company is a
106:50 - transportation company that company
106:51 - didn't even ask her
106:52 - a single technical question it was just
106:56 - a soft skill and
106:57 - at that point i was not able to believe
106:59 - i was like how the hell they like they
107:01 - don't even know their technical ability
107:03 - so sometimes like when you are starting
107:05 - out they don't care a lot about
107:06 - technical skills because
107:08 - you know that they know that if you're
107:09 - graduating uh if you graduated uh
107:11 - and if if you are here and if you have
107:13 - the skills listed you know a lot of
107:14 - stuff if you have that portfolio
107:16 - and if there if if you lack on some
107:18 - stuff they have the people to train you
107:20 - right
107:20 - so sometimes they would not even
107:22 - consider or bother having their
107:23 - technical
107:24 - interview if you are really good in
107:26 - those soft skills into you
107:28 - exactly exactly cool man so
107:32 - awesome so i think yeah i think it's a
107:35 - it's a very good session we had and i
107:37 - think we were able to help a lot of
107:38 - people
107:39 - and if you are watching this right now
107:42 - uh

Cleaned transcript:

what is up guys we are super excited for this topic especially personally me because i think a lot of people wants to know about this topic they wants to know uh that what we are going to be doing so daniel why don't you show them that what we are going to be doing today we are going to be talking about the top 10 or top eight interview questions plus going into an faqs along with you guys on what you have to do to get those interview questions just right so that you can ace that interview boss just like a boss just like a boss yes so guys drop down in the comments if you're like super excited for this live stream because we know we are so richie tom what's the agenda and what we're going to go over today yeah so today's live stream is highly focused on top eight common interview questions and we are going to be showing you the exact answer formats that you can use in your interview to kill that resum to kill that interview and to land that job and i think there are those these are the top eight common questions but a lot of time people uh usually make mistakes in this top eight questions and that is the reason we have came up with this topic so that we can help you land that job and plus if you stick to the end we have the bonus to land jobs 10x faster and i promise that this tricks are going to help you a lot guys please so let's get started yes and guys please stick to the end because richie did an awesome job putting this all together and we're going to deliver as much value to you as possible so go ahead richie give him that disclaimer awesome so the disclaimer is this eight questions are for general interviews like you can use that for any interview but we have used example for the answers as uh for software developers because they are rockstars and dick to go through a lot of trouble what do you say daniel yeah no no this is great because the thing is there's always a lot of general questions that get repurposed for a lot of things because the interviewers might get a little lazy like hey what other type of interview questions are there so they will be very helpful in your interviews potentially potentially yep so first of all let's start with why answering interview questions properly is super important like so drop down in the comments guys that what do you think are the reasons that why answering the proper questions are necessary so go ahead and danielle just gave you a hint yeah yeah sorry i'll wait a little next time but go ahead drop the knowledge on them richie yeah so i think the first reason why do you want to answer proper questions is proper answers will increase your chance by 90 and i think that is one of the most important thing that you guys want to do because uh you might apply for 300 400 jobs and you can definitely learn 10 uh definitely learn 10 interviews maybe but when you land those interviews what matters is that there are going to be competitors for you and to be that competitors answering proper uh answering that questions properly matters a lot and it will increase your chance 90 percent if you do that properly exactly so what happens is these companies have a job opening and they know the type of person that they want to work on that specific technology or with that specific team so they try to tailor those questions to see if you are that specific person so by properly positioning yourself and answering those questions correctly you can show whether you are that type of person but if you kind of just throw some weird answers and they're not the right answers then you might show that you're not a good fit which is why we want to show you these things so that you make sure we make sure you're giving the right answers so what's the second reason awesome and before we talk about the second reasons guy if you guys if you want to know about a real uh free training on how to build the whole netflix clone the link is in the description make sure to subscribe to that it's gonna be a very useful clone and you can put that project on your resume and you can land those jobs so make sure to subscribe for that uh free training it's completely free and you guys can subscribe to that and get that free training for you and have that resume have that project on your resume awesome so let's talk about the number two reasons so second reason is proper answer will prove you have strong skills basically most important in north america probably all over the world but most important in north america people see people focuses a lot on soft skills as they focuses on technical skills because obviously they wants to know that if you are a good team member or not obviously they don't wanna they don't want someone who is not a good team player right daniel so i think that is one of the most important things soft skills are as much necessary as you as much as technical skills look put very simply put yourselves in their shoes if you're trying to hire someone for a position do you want it to be someone who's hard to work with do you want to be someone who doesn't communicate his ideas right do you want to be someone who gets angry if you don't understand what he's saying right it's like you don't want to be working with someone who's not fun to work with so by having these strong soft skills you become that person that's fun to work with easy to work with if anything people feel excited and energized you have a lot of positive energy and that all happens through your that your transfer and your development of soft skills amazing danielle very well said i think so let's go forward and let's move to what are the types of interviews so uh guys drop it in the comments what do you think that what are the types of interviews that uh hiring managers uh usually uh takes so uh i think let's uh talk about the first interview daniel oh yeah yep yeah so go ahead yeah so i think the first and i think uh the this this is gonna be the first interview and there are gonna be like some sets of interview but i think that this is gonna be the first interview that's gonna be a general and soft skills interview where their goal is to learn about your attitude and mindset before they go through the technical interview dave wants to know that if you are a good fit for the team as we said and the goal for that interview is going to be to learn about your attitude and mindset so they are going to be asking you a couple of questions in that way they can know about your mindset and the way you answer those questions matters a lot because that's going to prove that you are way more smarter than other 10 people who are who they are going to be interviewing right daniel so that is what a general and a soft skill interview is exactly and this is also sometimes called the behavioral interview and again they just want to see if you have the right mindset the right attitude if you're going to be fun to work with if you can connect with them on a human to human level and if you're able to do all those things then they're gonna be like man like now if he just has this second part which is gonna be the second part of the interview then he would be an awesome and amazing fit so what exactly is that second part richie so the second thing is the technical interview now the goal for that interview is to learn about your technical ability though if let's say like if you apply for a frontend position that requires a reac js developer the goal for this interview would be they are going to be asking you to show your code maybe they are just going to give you some example to solve this problem they're going to ask you questions like states and props and react so that's going to be a technical interview but today here we are going to be focusing on the soft skills into the general interview that's gonna be the first interview that you're gonna be getting when you apply for jobs exactly exactly so like how richie said it's if you get that first part which we'll be going over today then there you go okay he's awesome he's great to work with he or she is great to work with but now do they have the technical ability can they actually develop software and that's what this is but like how richie said today we're gonna dive deep into the first part which is the behavioral type interviews and we're going to give you every single tip that you need questions that you might get asked and how to answer them so what you want to make sure is that in this presentation you want to take screenshots and you want to take notes because richie laid out some amazing examples that if i were to go back to my interviews i would definitely take notes on these i would take screenshots i would probably just have those in my head so here's a little trick about behavioral interviews i know i'm talking for a long itchy but a little tip about behavioral interviews is they have patterns they have trends it's not like the technical interview where it's always gonna be a different question it's these might be the same question or the same type of question so if you prepare for these before the interview when they ask you a question you might already know exactly what you want to share with them what story what experience that shows a specific attribute about yourself so richie let's go ahead and dive deep into some of these what do you say yes yeah for sure and most important thing is that you guys take screenshot because we have laid out the exact answer format that you can use in your interview all you need to do is like include your roles and your positions and your note and your name and also make sure to take notes because being and being ready for an interview can get you a very good job so let's get started without wasting any time daniel so guys you have to ask him richie you think they're ready yeah guys so if you are ready drop down in the comments if you're already it's gonna be one of the more personally for me it's gonna be one of the most exciting live stream as a lot of people wants to know how they can answer those common questions and it's like the questions are going to be like tell us something about yourself and that's where a lot of people bluff they don't know what to tell right so that those kind of things that we are going to be talking about so question one is gonna be tell us something about yourself and this is where a lot of people tend to believe even me i have went through some interest and when in the beginning when they used to ask me like tell us something i'm like i used to bluff that oh okay i'm rishi and stuff like that but let's see that what most people answer is okay so what's the wrong answer then rich well richie would show up hey i'm richie i'm a full stack developer i live in canada i'm trying to imitate ritchie i was born in india and i love playing sports and reading books now richie why do we feel that this is the wrong type of answer exactly i think when i started i used to answer this question just like this but this is a wrong wrong question if you answer like this the chances are that you are not gonna get higher now the things that you could avoid in this question is do not ever interfere your personal life they don't want to know what you read at that point because uh they don't have that time they have to go through a lot of participants so do not include your personal life and do not include anything that is not related to that position that is not relevant only and so now uh go ahead daniel and go to the next screen and tell them what are the tips they can use to answer this question exactly so just to reemphasize on what richie said right here they're trying to see if you're a good fit for the position if you're just telling them about all these random things my personal life don't relate to the position it's not going to help so instead what you want to do is potentially tell a story because us human beings the way we relate is by telling a story and if you're able to include your achievements your work history things that you've done things that are related to that position then they're definitely going to relate to you that's how you build that soft skills you relate to that human but then you show how you're right for that position then what you also want to tell them is what you know about that role because you want to be able to show that you have been doing the research that you do understand what it is that you're playing for and you feel like you are qualified for that so richie let's give him what a great answer looks like go ahead and read it for me brother awesome let's so i think the proper way to answer this question would be something like that that okay uh if someone's asking you tell us something about yourself you can start like that uh i started off my career as a freelancer back in 2019 and i had the privilege to work it clear programmer since almost six months now which has been a great experience joining clear programmer was an excellent opportunity for me and there i'm in charge of focusing highly improving uh student success with a team moreover i know you are looking for someone who can lead a team and i think with my experience in finding gabs and developing a clean and easy process for improving student success i believe that i will succeed in the role you are hiring for and guys make sure to screenshot these answers now what i did in this answer is first i introduced that how i started my career how i got into coding and then i'm also showing them that what i did or what i'm doing right now or what i did in my past and in the end i'm also showing them that uh uh what they are looking for so i told them that i know you are looking for someone who can lead the team and then i'm telling them that why i'm a good fit for that role and that is how a good and there are different ways i'm 100 sure that there are different right ways to answer that as well but this is one of the ways that you can use to answer your question exactly and guys just like how we said in the other slide he's telling a story he's getting them engaged like oh my god this is so cool he was working for them and then he was able to learn all these different things and he fits the position he's the perfect match now let's see well hopefully that's what they say [Laughter] so what's the second type of question that they might get richie so i think the second type of questions they might get is like why do you want this job and when they ask these questions what they mean is that why do you want this specific job at this company why do you want this specific position at this company because they wants to know that what is the one reason that have pushed you to uh apply for this job right and that is the reason they might ask you this job exactly and specificity is key because you don't want to just give bad motivations you want to show that you have the right intrinsic internal motivations but that you're also you know doing things for the right reasons so richie what does a wrong answer look like so i think a lot of people and even me when i started as i said a lot of people would answer something like that that uh as i'm looking for a fulltime job as a web developer i think i will be a right fit for this job based on my education and experience that is not a wrong answer that can be a good answer but this is not good enough to get your job just think about this like this way there are 10 people who are attending that interview who are they who are the hiring managers going to be entering 10 people and probably more than uh seven people are gonna be answering the question like this that i want this job because i feel that i'm the right fit based on my education and experience but they they hear this kind of answer a lot of times every single participants they go through they hear answer like this so there are a couple of things that you can avoid while answering uh this question so go ahead daniel and tell them what are the things they can avoid so the first one is you don't want to just show them that you're doing things maybe just for the monetary value the reason is because money is not a great incentive and it's not a great motivator over someone's longterm career span they want someone who's actually motivated by learning who's actually motivated by challenging themselves and developing code as a developer and as a programmer so look here's a reality maybe you do want a little more money maybe your financial situation isn't right and becoming a developer is going to help you there but here's what i challenge you if this is your case i challenge you to see if that's really the only reason that motivates you if it's not perfect because it probably isn't right like coding is too hard my opinion is programming is too hard for oh let me move programming is too hard for you to just slowly be motivated by money and go out there and crush it because you're going to be disappointed you're going to see that your code doesn't work because of some semicolon or some crazy they'd be like man it's not worth that money but if you like the challenge if you like challenging yourself and there's a lot of other things or you're doing it you have a bigger purpose then you want to talk about those things you don't want to talk about money because money is just like this thing that no one cares about right and what's the other one richie so and also i think very well said that and i think uh i think one thing to take away from that is that you should love the process of going through this interviews you should love the process of uh applying for this job because that is something that will let you grow a lot and that will help you to understand this process in a better way so that in next five years or maybe next in two years you will correct the formula to land those jobs so and the second point you might want to avoid is that never show them that you will leave that job for a better job you don't this is like so much crucial that you don't ever ever want to do that like don't show them that you're gonna leave that job if you get a better job next time show them that you're gonna stick to that job and uh i think let's talk about the tips that you can use to answer this question that why do you want to stop so that's gonna there's only gonna be one tip and i think this is like one of the most important thing that you want to use that show a direct connection between you and that specific job period that's it uh just show a direct connection that why do you want a job and i think uh that is one of the most important hiring managers want to know because they get all this kind of answers that i want this job because of my education and my work experience but no they are looking for a react js developer then why do you want this job you want to show them that okay i might have work on the projects they are working in their company right now and i can show them that okay i was working for this kind of project and i'm pretty much interested to work on those kind of projects with you so that i can bring amazing ideas on the table from my experience so let's see a perfect example uh go ahead how to answer why do you want this job exactly so look i realized that this company's name whatever company it is google microsoft whatever is working on building websites mobile applications for educational purposes and institutes that personally fascinate me you see there he's connecting it the motivations that that company has are the same motivations that i have right clever programmer uh where i always looked at uh was more of an online so now he's showing his experience of why right he's like i worked a clever programmer it was one of the online education schools we had different courses and my responsibility was working directly with students to improve their success so in this answer go ahead screenshot it but you'll see how rich is putting himself in the position where he understands the motivation of the company he understands the motivation of the person who needs to be in that position and he's literally just picking himself up and putting himself right there and just positioning himself as the person who needs to have that job what do you say rishi yes for sure uh i just want to read this to them because i think this is uh something important for them so i just want to read them read it to them so let's take an example so you would go like this that i've realized that if it's microsoft let's say i realize microsoft is working on building websites and mobile applications for educational purpose and institutes and that personally fascinates me a lot as my previous company clever programmer where i worked at was more of an online education school where my major responsibilities was to work directly with students to improve their success and i believe which gave me the skills to bring some of the most amazing ideas on the table at microsoft now what i did in this answer is that i figured out a correlation that okay clever programmer is more of an online education school and that company is working on an educational purposes stuff right so i would say that based because i have the experience in students i they know that i can bring some amazing ideas on the table of that company and that is how you can answer that question sorry about that a little technical difficulty here uh here we go what is the third one richie the third one is why do you want this job now how do you try to not want to answer that right go ahead richie show him what's up yeah so i think a lot of people when they are trying to answer that they are going to be like i'm a hardworking talented individual with strong interpersonal skills and i think i'm the perfect person for this role and i think that is not how you answer that a lot of people also i think the second question the third one is the same so i think a lot of people would answer like this as well and i do not think that this is the right way to answer that question so let's talk about the things that you yeah go ahead no go go ahead i'm just gonna lead on to the next one what do they want to avoid rishi so they just want to say you don't want to you never ever want to fake this answer you never want to show that you are perfect now there are two reasons like you don't want you don't want to show perfect because that no one is perfect in the world you can show them like if you are if you do if you like some skills just be honest to them that okay i might not know the skills but tell them that you are keen to learn and you will make sure to them that you are gonna be you're gonna be right fit because you're keen to learn and you will learn those technologies for them and uh and and i think when you lie that you are just perfect and when you fake this answer they're just gonna catch up like this what do you say then you know yeah i mean everyone knows that nobody is perfect right so if you start lying about you being perfect they're going to know you're lying and now they're going to ask themselves do we want to work with the liar and the answer is obviously no nobody wants to work with a liar nobody wants to work with someone with negative energy that has insecurities that they have to lie about their own things they love transparency they love honesty so make sure you do not try to fall into that frame of being perfect so richie what do they want to do yeah so the tip is gonna be that show them why you are unique like based on they are getting like thousands of introduced so you want to show them why you are specifically unique and why you would be a good fit for that job i think that is one of the most important thing you want to show them like why you are unique and the second thing that you can show you uh show you can help them solve their problems and i think this is one of the most important then you'll go ahead and explain why the second point is necessary exactly because the reality is everyone has problems each person has a problem each company has a problem right and the reason the company is opening up this position is because they need someone that's going to help them solve a specific problem maybe they don't have a website maybe they don't have a backend maybe they don't even know how to develop things maybe they just need more bandwidth so if you could show that you can help solve that problem then again you're just putting yourself in that position it's like with these soft skills with these answers you put yourself in the position that they want to hire you so richie what does that look like for them so i think uh just to add to some add something on the last point like as a developer they always see you as a problem solver right and i think that is the reason you want to show them that how you can because honestly just uh frankly speaking no one gives a like how many uh technologies you know and stuff like that they just want to know how you can answer that how you can solve their problem they're facing right now they're if they're lacking a react.js developer who can lead a team how you can show them show them like how you can solve that problem now maybe the right way to answer this question is that you can start by saying that i understand like now you're going to be showing that i also understand that what what is the requirement so you can say that i understand that one of the key requirement for this position is expertise in react.js you should hire me because i have a unique understanding of the latest uh latest concepts of reexists such as redux and hooks i realized that knowing react native is an asset for this role and i have been working with react native since almost over a year one thing i do not have in my skill sets that you are looking for is react bootstrap but i'm eager to learn it from amazing people and i do not believe it will be hard for me to catch up uh and i also learned that your company values leadership and i know without a doubt i will sustain the company's standards and lead the team to a greater success now go ahead daniel why answering a question why answering this question this is important like what are the important things they can what are key takeaways from this answer again guys look richie puts himself in the position of i know react.js i know redux hooks you know i'm in the latest trend i know what's going on but look how he also shows the imperfection was like but i don't know react bootstrap which is something that was asked for with this project but then again look how he shows that he's openminded he's willing to work he's willing to learn he says he would be willing to work harder and try to learn these new technologies to be able to do what he needs to be able to lead the team and solve the specific problems so i think this covers all the tips that you talked about richie there anything else you want to add to that no for sure i think uh that's it but make sure guys to subscribe screenshot this and if you want a free training on netflix clone the link is in the description go ahead and subscribe that it's a complete free training exactly now the reason why we're telling you to go get that free training is because it's hard to get this interview if you don't have awesome portfolio build up like the netflix clone like the amazon clone like all these other clones that we're building so guys go ahead go to that link if you want to get that first step into getting these interviews so with that being said richie what is the fourth common question the fourth common question is what is your greatest weakness and as you can see that meme at the bottom i would say nothing i wish it was nothing right what is your greatest weakness daniel what is your greatest weakness let's let's apart from the interview things like what is your christmas weakness exactly so the way that i like to approach this one is i like to very similar to the other ones is i might specifically talk about something that you know i'm transparent i'm open i'm not going to lie to them but it does take a lot of selfawareness right like maybe it's like oh man i'm a perfectionist or i do something like that right but you have to one note why that's a weakness like what are the downsides of that and then two or actually when i get into this but two i talk about how i'm improving that so richie go ahead and dive into some of these wrong answers and expand a little more a lot of people like when they're answering this question is that my greatest weakness is i work super hard and i guarantee you on that that there are like a bunch of lot of people who are answering like this and that makes like i i and it's completely okay like when you are when you are beginner you like i used to answer uh questions like this and that's completely okay but it makes me laugh that i used to answer like that that i work super hard and i think that's like a no no no if you're gonna go to an interviewer and let's uh and you're gonna say that my weaknesses i work super hard just kidding it makes me laugh right now so they're just gonna be laughing hard inside but they cannot definitely show you but yeah they are gonna be and uh maybe like there are different wrong answers for this that uh some people would say that nothing i do not have any weakness and when you say that what you're trying to do is that you're trying to prove them that you are perfect you do not have any weakness and i would say that there is not a single person on earth that would not have a single weakness in them because no one is perfect everyone is still learning and everyone wants to learn and you want to show that part instead of just showing them that uh you are perfect and you do not have any weakness what what's your take on that daniel like you have been uh working with uh blue origin which is a company from amazon and uh that's a great company guys um so what is your take on that why do you want to not show them that you are perfect look exactly the first one very like we're talking about soft skills with soft skills is how you communicate with people so the first one just shows you're completely arrogant right like if you're going to say that you work super hard as a weakness it's like no this guy's not like he's arrogant he thinks he's like that's not confidence that's being cocky right it's like nobody wants to work with someone like that the second one you just straight up blind again like we said we all know that nobody is perfect so if you don't talk about those things that make you imperfect they're going to realize that you're not open you're not honest and you're not transparent so what else do they want to avoid so uh they want to avoid never to fake this answer because like you should not fake this answer that doesn't mean that you should hide some stuff but you don't want to fake this answer at all because as daniel said you want to show them that you are perfect never ever do that because the hiring managers interview like thousands of people in a year and they would just catch up like this that you are faking this answer so do not fake this answer the next thing you want to avoid is never show a witness which is harder or impossible to change now i think this is one of the most important thing you don't want to show like also you at the same time when you're not faking this answer you don't want to show them a weakness which is harder impossible to change let's say that let's let's talk about that i'm a very bad temper person and i think in order to change that weakness of yourself uh it's gonna take years i mean it's probably you can change that definitely but it's gonna take years because you have been bad temper since maybe childhood then they're probably gonna feel that no no for this person because they have a weakness which is very hard or maybe impossible to change in real life so that is the reason you don't want to show them a weakness which is almost impossible to change you want to show them something that is possible and that can be changed right daniel so why don't you go ahead and talk about tips they can use to answer this question exactly so again if you show that realistic weakness you're not going to come out as cocky or arrogant you're going to come out as vulnerable open honest and they'll be like all right that's someone that i could connect with that's someone that i could talk to now if you show something you can change you could talk about how you're trying to change those things and what you're currently doing to try to improve those things because again we all have weaknesses just not everybody is trying to improve their weaknesses so richie let's go ahead and get into a right answer yep awesome let's go ahead and write read the right answer so i when you are answering this you want to make sure that you show them that there is a weakness in you but that can be changed so let's focus let's i'm gonna read out to you make sure to screenshot this that i'm gonna read out to you i realized with my experience that my greatest weakness is that i get overwhelmed when a deadline is near and then it is very hard for me to manage time and complete it before deadline now i'm gonna i'm showing them that there is a weakness in me that uh when there is a deadline i get overwhelmed now but i'm gonna also show them that but i have been working on them on that since last month and i'm even doing some courses on time management which has strongly helped me to improve my weakness and i believe with time i will be able to improve it completely so uh now i start by saying that okay i do have a weakness and i'm gonna i'm showing them that i have a weakness that can't be changed that uh that i get uh tends to i get overwhelmed i tend to freak out when there is deadline near uh but uh when there's a deadline near a job when i have to submit a project to the client but i have been working on that and i'm doing some courses on the time manager as well so they are like okay this guy is honest that he accepts he have this weakness now they're also thinking that okay at the same time he's when i'm showing them some proof i'm showing them them some social proof that okay since last month i'm even doing some courses on time management so that they know that this guy is very openminded and he wants to work on those weakness that is the reason he's working on that and then he also says that i believe with time i will be able to improve it completely and when i say the last sentence i believe with time i will be able to improve it completely they would believe it because i i'm honest with them and when you're honest with them and then when you tell them that i'm also working on something there there are chances that 99 or 0.99 they would believe you what what's your take you know because uh you have been working with a lot of amazing people and they have a lot of weaknesses right they have a lot of weakness and they would always be open mind to confess that with you right so have you been in a situation or something like that where you know that this guy has this weakness and he's very openminded and he's eager to learn even you can talk about yourself right that some weakness you had yeah i mean this this is also just a the perfect answer if you're seeing this screenshot it write something like that but yeah when i've had conversations with coworkers it's just about being open it's just about being transparent and it's about being honest and trying to see how him or her or both of you guys could come to the right solution because in the end of the day you're problem solver that means technical skills that means people skills whatever that may be so guys take a screenshot of this picture and richie let's go ahead and get into the next one what type of question is that richie awesome that is what is your greatest strength obviously you are not a super man but then how do you answer this question what is your greatest strength what strength do you want to show them what strength do you want to hide from them and how do you answer that question now let's go ahead then you'll go ahead and tell them what is the wrong answer a lot of people would uh use well the wrong answer would be my greatest strength is that i am able to complete every task on time and i feel i am perfect at whatever i do because i'm superman right and that is the wrong answer again because you're expecting perfectionism from that person so what do they want to avoid when talking about these answers so i think you want to show a strength which is not a real no you don't want to show them a strength which is not a realistic again like just like weakness you wanna you you wanna show a strength which is completely realistic not something that no one can be perfect and i don't think that every no one can uh submit everything on time yeah there can be some people who would have done that but there is no one perfect so you don't want to show them a strength which is not realistic another thing that uh never shows strength which is not related to that to that role so maybe like if some person is asking the firing managers are going to be asking you that what's your strength and you started talking like my greatest strength is that uh i can't run like at uh 30 miles per hour yeah probably like i make some bomb ass hot chocolate so i'm not gonna be like hey uh what's your greatest strengthening because pregnant oh my hot chocolate you should see it i put the right amount of milk the right amount of cream the hot chocolate is amazing i mean it's strength right but it's not related to what they're looking for so what are the tips that we need to give them yeah it just makes me laugh that you're talking about how to make that hot chocolate you probably don't want to know that what kind of chocolates you make so you probably want to avoid that but one tip you want to take in consider is that show a strength which you have which matches the job description now what how you can do that is go through the job description read it carefully like even if it take one hour two hours doesn't matter you need that job if you have that interview go to that job description like and then read out all the things that they need from a person they want to be hiring and then you figure out that okay they need a react.js developer what are your strengths that you can show them because they just care how you can help them how you can solve their problem again back to the agenda that how you can solve the problem so you want to show them a strength which is going to be which is going to help them and not just help you to maybe just market yourself about your hot chocolate right so what does that answer look like richie okay so i'm going to read it for you make sure to screenshot this uh yeah so i that's how it starts i feel my greatest strength is knowing the latest react hooks and debugging the code when using react.js in my previous role i was responsible for highly using and teaching latest concepts of react like hooks and giving feedback to students on that code which helped me to have a better understanding of debugging the code with minimal errors moreover while studying mobile application development in my college i learned the importance of react hooks and had the opportunity to work on some real world projects now when i'm talking this uh when i'm answering discussion i suddenly start with my greatest strength is what are the greatest so i know that they are looking for someone who can work with rex and they also want someone who knows react hooks and who is good at debugging the code so that's how i start that okay i had this trend in me because even if they start asking me some questions about hooks and debugging i can answer that so that i have this strength in me which is directly correlated to the job description and that is what i have exactly shown here and then i'm also talking about that why i have this trend so most important thing while answering the question uh daniel is social proof i'm saying them that i was responsible for teaching the latest concept of react in my previous job and giving feedback on their code so that helped me to understand uh debugging the code with minimal errors right so this is the social proof that i'm providing so make sure when you answer every question you provide them a social proof that why you are good at this thing not just showing them that because it's it's important to answer that question in a proper way that you know we know that you know that you are you have this trend but the most important thing is why do you have discern how do you develop this trend so you want to show them that i developed this trend from your from my previous job or something like that and also just uh some extra bonus that uh while studying this uh in my college i also get to work on some realworld projects so what do you feel about this and said daniel what are the key take away from toys answer it's like i said great answer because you're showing the strength that is related to the position you're putting yourself and showing them that you fit this exact position right and then you're giving that social proof which just furthermore reinforces that they should hire you for that position so i would say screenshot it awesome answer and let's go on to number six which is what is your expected salary and we're gonna be there like danny devito throwing dollar bills at all of them ready to just make it rain cash so what does a bad answer look like richie uh probably when you're asked like what is your expected salary like a lot of people would answer something like i do not have any salary range because they don't have done their research uh they would be like i'm happy to work on work for whatever i get this get at this time as i'm starting my career and just want to learn okay that is okay that you are happy to work for whatever you get at this point of your career and because you are just starting out your career you just want to learn but that does not mean that does not mean that you don't provide them a salary range and for that you need to be prepared so so daniel uh you might have uh you might have got a question like this that or you might have even like hired someone uh with your job that uh and you guys might have asked questions like i do not have us uh what's your sell what's your expected salary so what do you think that there are other wrong ways to answer this question uh instead of just saying that i do not have a salary range what do you think about that there's multiple wrong ways but maybe what's important to start to go towards is the right answer and that's i mean you just want to at least have some knowledge some knowledge of how much you should be worth what people are paying for so you want to make sure you prepare for those things but what are the things that they do want to avoid when answering these questions richie so uh let's go ahead and talk about the thing so the first thing you want to avoid is that never show them you don't uh never show you don't care about money you want to show them yes you do care about the money uh of course you are not just there for money uh but yes you do care about money because those are your skills those are the things that uh you have worked on you have spent like hours and hours and years and years to learn those skills now you don't want to show them that you don't care about money of course you don't you of course you do care about the money but at the same time you don't want to make them feel that you only and only care about money and the second thing uh you don't want to show them is never sure you can also you can work you can also work for less money now these are the two most important thing i have realized because uh a lot of people uh they just uh when hiring managers are asking that what is your expected seller they always try to feel that okay like uh maybe they have a budget and what if like i answered that answer uh give them a salary range which is not into their budget and they're just not going to hire me that's not true you when you when you show that sometimes what happens is not sometime most of most of the time what happens is that if you have a good technical skills if you're a good soft skill what they're gonna do is that they're gonna make you do the same job for less money they might have a budget for like eighty thousand dollars for that job but if you show them that you don't care about money maybe they would just make you do that job for seventy thousand dollars or maybe even 65 so you never ever want to show that that you don't care about money you want to show them of course you do care about the money but the same time you don't only care about the money so if you want if you want to like um if you if you want to know like how but you'll be like how do i figure out that uh how the hell like what's my salary like i don't know i never worked before like how do i know so daniel like why don't you tell them that how do they know that like they don't if they don't have a salary range what they can do i mean if you don't have a salary range you could easily just go to dr google and you go to dr google and you figure it out you put in what is the salary range that is expected because you need to know what you're worth what your skills are worth and what your value is worth so what are some of these tips that we should give them richie after they go to dr google and figure those things out actually that's one of the tips right yeah so as daniel yeah so as danielle said that you want to go to dr google you want to ask google that you want to go and just search for like if you're searching for a reac js developer in usa you want to go to that what is the annual salary uh fresh reactions developer would get and you will find tons of like a salary uh you will find a tons of website that shows a salary rate now if you are like if you have some experience and you want to go with an average salary with you just because you have like you got couple of three or four years of experience in reach chase and then uh you just go to google and you search like what is the average salary of react js and in united states and i think it's probably 120 k and it's a huge right daniel vhs is picking up guys by the way it's picking up super fast and that's why our papa reacts sunny aka sunny is uh making those amazing clones and just to make sure like we have also uh organized uh if you're watching this if you have joined this late we have organized a completely free training for you guys we are going to be building a netflix clone in that free training and uh as then you'll say that you if you're if you land those interview first of all you need those projects so go sign up the link is in the description go sign up for those projects uh and uh for those for that netflix clone completely free training and make sure to have that project on your resume now let's talk about the tips before you answer questions before you answer that question ask questions about the role because you just don't want to give you even if you know salaries you don't want to shoot a salary in air because you want to know like what is expected from that job maybe they're giving some bonuses maybe they're just giving because like most of the time in uh in canada like a lot of people a lot of jobs they provide you uh uh even if you're if you're not a permanent resident they provide you with a health benefit so you might pro when you provide a salary range that might be you might think that they were going to provide me a health benefit now if you if you you might want to ask questions about dead role right maybe like what if they are expecting someone who uh who can work overtime for them who can work in weekends for them so before you answer that question you want to make sure that you know almost every single thing about that role what do you think about it daniel because i think this is very important i think we should i it's really important to uh talk about this yeah for sure because if you don't understand what you're signing yourself up for then you you just can't be throwing random numbers right like if you're gonna be putting in a lot of hours over time working weekends then you might actually want to ask for even more than the regular salary range if you're gonna be working less there's already a lot of benefits included then it's not unfair for you to ask for like a lot more money than way more than the market average right so just understanding what's that position that is open for you so then the second tip again would be researching the current market for your specific position and again goes back to question one or the tip number one which is understanding what it is that they are looking for and that role specifically and what's that fifth tip richie or sorry third trip tip so the third tip would be always ask for five to ten k more because they will negotiate and that is something that you should always do like if you're in north america probably always go for five to ten thousand dollars more because they are always always going to be negotiating i swear to god that you're always gonna negotiate and he did don't good for you you got five to ten thousand more than you expected right so uh because that thing happens a lot because talk about something that daniel that how how do they negotiate like why do you want to tell them that uh if you if you are like if you if your expected salary is 60 000 you always want to go with that i'm expecting something around uh 65 to 70k why do you want to why do you want to do that go ahead and explain them briefly like they want to do that because look best case scenario if you give you know a 10 case 5k more or whatever they say yes he's like all right cool now you have more salary for the year now if they say yes right away maybe they were already giving you a super low expected one regardless but regardless when you negotiate you always want to aim higher because they're the ones that are going to start lower and then you want to try to find each other in the middle if you go to your expected range or what you think you're going to get right away and they go lower it's always going to keep on going down so if you add that 5 to 10k cushion and it make it goes down to the middle it might go to that original salary you first expected yes for sure and one thing to note over uh one thing to note is that the first uh tip tip number one before answering and ask question about it that is important make sure because like once you give them a once you provide them a salary range there's no go back there is no go back like if you tell them that i'm expecting something around uh 60 000 and then they're gonna negotiate and you might settle for 55 and then you don't have health benefits you don't have a lot of stuff you have to work in the weekends you have to work overtime so then there's no go back so you want to ask them questions before before you are answering or the question uh how what is your expected salary now let's go ahead daniel and let's talk about what can be the perfect answer for them uh for to answer what is your expected salary so i'll just read it straight out and the first one is before i answer that question i would like to know more about what that job has to offer me including bonuses insurance and would like to know my responsibilities briefly again this is going back to tip number one so once they answer those things for you you now have a better understanding of the job you now have a better idea of the job so now you could relate how you would fit that and based on my experience current market and what the job has to offer me i would say i would like to go between 75 to 80 000 and if this is the job that is offered to me i'm sure we can come up with an agreement on the salary so again you're saying you're open for negotiation you already did your mark your research the 75 to 80k might be an extra 5 to 10k from what you originally expected and you're saying you're open to negotiating so they're more than happy to work with you if they want you for that job yes and last sentence in this answer uh in the second answer is must must think that you you want to say that i'm sure we can come to an agreement on salary because when you're providing them similar range okay now you got your uh all you know all the responsibilities about your job briefly now you know that what salary range you're providing you're providing them a five to ten thousand dollar more salary rate but sometimes sometimes hiring managers uh they don't feel that they want to negotiate so if you provide them 75 to 80k they just have a budget for like 60k or 65k they'll uh they're going to be like no i don't want to hire this guy because he has more budget so at the end you want to add this line that i'm sure we can come to an agreement on salary if you can say something like if this job is offered to me i'm sure we can come to an agreement on salary and when you say that they they know that uh this person is ready for negotiation so that is the reason you guys want to say that awesome screenshot this don't forget to screenshot that guys screenshot it right now i'll give you a couple more seconds all right your couple seconds are over next one so like four i went fast i went fast man number seven they're gonna ask you what are your goals and you're gonna be like man i got lots of goals man what's the wrong answer that some people say richie uh a lot of people would answer something like i see myself in like i i think and it's it's not wrong like a lot of people would answer that i see myself in a managerial position or i dream to have my own company for what i learned from here in next few years boss the wrong thing over here is again you are showing them you're going to leave that job even though you want to own your company next few years even though you you see yourself in that manager position work hard but do not show them that you're going to be leaving that job what's your take on daniel i just want to talk more on that because like a lot of people when they ask about goals like they try to be smart but at the same time like they don't know that when trying to be smart they are making a mistake showing them that you will live you are going to be leaving the job so what are the things they can avoid for sure so like how we just said you don't want to show them that you're just trying to use them so that you could leave them right sometimes you're looking for someone who's going to stay there and who's going to have a lot of impact on the company so instead of trying to be like oh yeah i just i just want to use you guys for a couple years and then leave you guys i mean maybe that's the truth but that's not how you want to go about it so instead what are some things or what's this no they want to see you are in their company for long term and wants to hire someone for this job only so i'm not saying lie and say i want to stay with you guys for 50 years if that's not the truth right that's not the truth don't lie about it but talk about your couple years that you plan on being with them which is you know in those three years those five years or whatever you don't have to specify but say with my time with you guys i want to be able to do all these different things so that is exactly what the tip will lead them to which is what richie yes so exactly uh just so the tip is that show them that you will improve this position and how you can improve this position and how you can improve so the thing is that the thing is that any hiring manager in the world you can pick up any hiding manager they want if they have posted a posting if they have posted a job uh on whatever platform they're posting they want someone for specific that job they don't want someone uh they don't want someone for the who's gonna be managing the next five years or next three years they don't want someone who wants to have their own company next three years they want someone for that specific job and that is the reason you just want to show them how you will improve this position and you want to show them that you will improve this position and how you will extend the capabilities of this project so daniel before we get to the right answer i want to ask something that because blue origin is hiring like a lot of amazing people like you so what do you think that uh do dick i mean uh probably i want your take on that so do take consider people who have dream who have bigger dreams like they want to have their open uh they want to open their own amazon in next few years or open their own blurry do they consider something like that or it's just a false thing that you want to avoid no i mean they in the end they would probably if it's a company that doesn't support your longterm goals it's probably not a company you want to work for plain and simple right it's probably toxic it's probably not the right environment there's probably people there who would hold you back as opposed to trying to help you propel forward so when i worked at blue origin it was completely different it was people who were encouraging it was people who wanted you to succeed whether it was with them or not now here's the thing when i showed up to the interview i wasn't talking about the things i was trying to do without them i was talking about the things that i was going to improve in there in that position and those kind of things but again if you if if it's a company where you talk about like oh yeah and i also want to have a business in 10 years and they're like oh we don't want you well good don't be with them they're probably very toxic environment to be with so what does a right answer look like richie awesome let's go ahead and uh let's read the right answer go ahead brother okay so when they're asking like what are your goals you want to show them that you're going to stay into that position you are perfect for that question you're going to expand the capabilities of the position so here we go make sure to screenshot that uh here we go in the next few years i see myself greatly improving my in my role and be an expert in developing websites in react with latest tech i plan to immerse and understand areas and gaps that can be improved in this position and expertise on how i can guide the new joiners in the right direction moreover i also look forward to utilize what i learned from here and help other department department as well now what i have done here is that i have shown them that okay they are looking for a react.js developer but they also want someone who can stay at the latest 10 trend so i'm telling them that i see myself to be an expert in developing websites with react but with the latest stack now i'm also showing them that i plan to find the areas in the gaps that will be lacking uh what improvements that we're needing for this position where and that is how i can improve that position and be an expertise on how i can guide the new joiners in the right direction because i and i can also tell them that as i love teaching uh i have also been teaching educator programmer and as i love teaching i would be happy to to guide the new joiners in the right direction because that is something that i'm passionate about now that is again one social proof right and more then again in the end i say that moreover i look forward to utilize what i learned from here so now what i learned from you there they also they'll know that the things you're gonna be learning from here you're not gonna let it go in with so how are you gonna use them so you can say something like i i will from what i learned from here i i'll try to help other department as well maybe like something like marketing or something like that so then they're like okay this guy is a great team member he's ready he's openminded to work with other department he's openminded to uh also guide the new joiners and he specifically wants to improve his role not he wants to go for that managerial position or something like that and probably uh even if you're going for that hide that hide that so well that they don't know like just improve and i think most of the hiring managers would know that definitely did they know that you're not going to stay there for like 10 years for sure but you want to answer it well that they know that you have or you aim to extend the capabilities of that position and you also and how you can do that you can help other department you can help the new joiners and you also show them a social proof that okay i have been working with club program i have been teaching and i can also teach the new joiners once i'm comfortable with this job so daniel go ahead what's what's the key takeaway dude it's it's just a great answer overall like everything just talked on all i could say is screenshot this slide because it's a great answer guys and i say we now go to the last question of the top eight questions which is the company asking do you have yeah go ahead go ahead do you have any questions for us and here we go what what movies i forgot what movie that's from but yeah they want to see what questions you have right and what is the wrong way to answer this richie most of people would be like i do not have any questions okay that is like that is a wrong wrong question and i think okay at certain level that is okay but that's probably a wrong question you want to avoid that you don't want to show them that you don't have any questions and something else that bothers me a lot is that sometime i'm not saying a lot of people but sometimes some people would be like i have a question what actually does the company do now here if you answer this question like this you are not going to get that job for sure 100 because if you ask something like what does that what what actually does the company do they're like holy this guy like he went for it he came to an interview for this company and he did not even did his own research what the hell so you don't want to answer you don't want to ask questions like what the because if you if you are going to an interview probably you should be knowing that uh what does that company does right daniel because even if you're like daniel when you started with blow region you did all your own research right yeah yeah exactly like i knew exactly what the mission of the company was i knew what they were doing what they were hiring for those were the things that i was doing right so i wasn't when they asked me that what were the questions that i had i already had an idea of some questions showing up to the interview because they always ask you like do you have any questions for us so i wasn't afraid to start to ask them questions right and i it wasn't like what does it say no if you're running next to next with another candidate yes so i wasn't afraid to ask questions because i knew i was giving that advantage and knowing more about the position knowing about what they were looking for and positioning myself properly so again i was showing up asking the right questions and i was avoiding this big thing that you want to work which is don't be afraid to not even ask the right questions but don't be afraid to just ask questions in general oh yeah i see them not now she always say the right questions because obviously the other one was a bad question so what are some tips they could do to prepare to ask the right questions richie yeah before we go to the tips like just just to note to make sure that the reason why you want to ask the right questions is because that if you are running neck to neck with another candidate let's say that there is one other guy uh who is there for interview with you and you guys have like done a great job entering and you guys like you guys go like same similar points in that interview and if you ask the right question you will land that job for sure like i guarantee you that that asking the right question will lend you the job if you are running neck to neck with another candidate so so one thing that matters is you all you want to ask you don't want to you don't want to be afraid to write i need uh afraid to ask the question but at the same time you also want to ask the right questions not want to ask like what does company actually do right so that is how uh that that is something that will matter when you are running through a candidate which is like a proper competitor with you now let's talk about some tips how do you answer this question so before you answer that create a list of questions in advance do your own research go to that company's website get the hell out of that website whatever they are looking for go to the job description spend hours looking for the job description figure out what the what kind of person they wants to and go to that company's website figure out like everything that company is doing what are the types of project and based on that figure out like maybe two or three important questions or maybe four important questions that you want to ask them it doesn't matter even if you want to ask questions like that right now we were talking we were just talking with nas before the live stream and he we were talking about this question and he was like uh i think uh probably nas what he used to ask when he was interviewed with google uh twitter and companies like that he also asked questions like what's the team like right uh how does the team work what's the environment like so that kind of questions is necessary because that kind of questions you cannot find on website right but you can always find out like what does the company actually does on the website and that is the reason you don't want to ask questions like that what does the company do and they're like what the hell what does this guy do no no yeah so like you're like are you serious like i swear like people are gonna be like that that uh they're gonna freak out if you don't know about that company when you enter that interview so make sure to do that now so the tip is that create a list of questions in advance like when you go through that company when you go to the description maybe like if they are asking in description they're asking that uh you might also have to uh work on some other technologies so maybe you can have ask questions like what other technologies do i need to work on right so you want to ask that kind of question so but prepare a list in advance so that you don't bluff out at that point now why don't you talk about tip number two daniel go ahead yeah so tip number two is make them feel you want to make sure that you are the right fit again when it's an interview it's not just them seeing if you're right for the company but it's you seeing if you are right fit for that company or for that position so by asking these questions now you're flipping the tables around and you're saying huh okay well like obviously i'm answering these questions super well because i saw richie and daniel's powerpoint so i'm super prepared for these and potentially i'm killing the technical interview questions so obviously i'm a great fit but my question to you company is are you the right fit for me so you flip the tables around and now you're trying to ask those questions that they're gonna be like man we really want this guy and we're gonna try to answer the questions the best of our ability so what's the third tip and the reason why you add on to that yeah before we yeah before we go to the yeah before we go to the third tip the reason why you want to show them you want to make them feel that you also want to make sure you are the right fit because you want to show them that you do care about this job you want to make sure that you are the perfect faith you are not choosing the wrong job and you're just not here for the money even though if you are do not show them and probably i think you won't be but do not show them even if you are but when you when you do that when you ask questions and when you make sure that you are you're right fit from your end for that company they'll be like okay this guy does care about this job that he also wants to make sure he's the right fit and that will make you stand out so this kind of small things that we are gonna we are telling you this kind of small tips make sure you take those notes because that will make you stand out from a lot of candidates it seems that this kind of these are common things but we usually see that people making this common mistakes and uh and it's like it tends to get nervous and they bluff out and it's things get weird in an interview so make sure to take notes of this tip screenshot this and whatever you want but take these tips because it's i think it's pretty interesting and it is based on our experience because we have been interviewed with some companies and the third tip is that show them you are interested in drawing into the role and the company now you also when you're making sure that you're the right fit for the company you also want to show them that you are interested in the role and the company and how you can do that is that you also ask questions like uh maybe the values of the company shares and stuff like that and about even about the role be specific about it like even if you have like uh some questions about a role that okay like if it's reach js developer you're like okay i see that there's uh the role describes that uh if you know uh react native it's an asset so you wanna ask questions like are we gonna be working on mobile applications because it's just a web developer position and that is okay to ask questions like that because that shows you really care about that job you really care about your role and that company and that makes you stand out from a lot of people rather than just answering that no i don't i don't have any questions or uh it's just asking some basic question ask questions related to that role and the company so let's go ahead and daniel read out for them what a right answer looks like so example number one i was doing my own research and i realized that the company is highly focused on building websites and applications for the educational purpose but does the company aim to enhance on other categories as well so you're showing you're interested you're showing that you want to know more about the company and you're also trying to see if they would be that good fit for you what do you want to add to that richie yeah so okay so that is some tricky stuff that that's going on in this answer is that like when you're asking that now the hiring manager gets into mindset that okay this person cares about the role and he's making sure that does the company and hence is to sorry uh and hence to work on other categories as well because uh maybe like you you want to work on other categories as well instead of just educational purpose right so they will be like yeah this person cares about that so that when you ask questions like this that and the one thing that matters in this question in this answer is that they would definitely know that okay awesome this guy knows what the hell we are working right now this guy exactly knows what the hell we are working and he also wants to know what we will be working in future so now you that now the tables have turned they were asking you like what are your goals now you are asking them what are their goals but you're just being more specific and it's completely okay to ask them questions because they want to see how much you care about that job and they want to see you are just not another person who are just here for uh just you just don't want uh you're just a person who just want another job you they want to see that you want to help people you want to help people and you want to make their lives easier in a community who share the same passion for technology right daniel exactly exactly so let's go and head over to example number two and that would read something like apart from the skills listed on my uh cover le or cv curriculum item what other technologies and skills will i get to learn from this role so similar to what rich just talked about which is you're flipping the tables you're trying to see if you're going to be a good fit for them they're going to try to qualify themselves now they're going to try to answer those questions and they're seeing you're interested they're seeing that you're right for the position and they're just trying to see if now they are right for you anything else reaching for sure and when you yeah for sure 100 and when you when you show something like this that yeah you are like now the way i think this is something that i think a lot of people should start asking and introduce to the hiring managers because this will this will show them that you are like eager and you are keen to learn new uh new technologies and new skills right so you're asking that apart from the skills listed on my cv so those are the skills that i know what other technologies and skills i will get to learn from this role so not just it's just not one way thing like you it's not just that you are providing them skills you're also asking them what what are the things that i will be learning and definitely it's very good question to ask because uh they will be like okay this guy is like so openminded he is very smart that he wants to learn from this role as well and he is not he's now when you when you have answered the previous questions just like how we did they're like okay this guy is being honest the uh this guy's uh is not lying he is not proving that he's perfect he has shown his weaknesses and now he's also say he's also showing that he wants to learn now like i think probably no one would like ever wants to not hire this kind of person who is honest who accepts that that person is not perfect who shows the realistic witness who shows the realities realistic strength based on some social proofs and also shows that he wants to improve that weakness and he's working on that weakness and he also wants to learn from that role now i don't think that there will be uh people who would not want to hire this kind of people what's your take yeah no i i mean i completely agree because you're showing why again by asking them questions these type of right questions you're showing them why you are the right fit honestly because again you're putting yourself in that situation where they want you to work for them so richie that was eight of the most common questions right oh we're still on the question one so what else do you want to know richie yeah so uh so one thing to note from here is that don't ask too many questions obviously you want to ask them questions but you don't want to spend like half an hour or hour just asking them questions you want to ask them like three or four questions but just the most relevant questions that will make you stand out and that can that will for sure help you to land that job but do not ask like 15 or 20 questions or even 10 questions and i think that's important because like then hiring managers will be like what the hell is going on this guy is interviewing us yeah because it's not that interview it's your interview and i think uh something else that yeah and you don't want to ask questions like do you pay by check i mean you do care about that stuff i'm not saying that you don't care about that stuff at this point you don't want to ask questions like that do you pay by check are there possibilities of promotions would you would i have to work after hours now like don't ask questions like this at this point and even if you want to ask something like that make sure you phrase that in a more better way that they feel that okay this is relevant not just a random other question so you don't want to do that just don't keep on asking questions one thing i just like realized daniel was that me and daniel guys before we run into bonus me and daniel were like just preparing for this live stream we're doing just testing and then danielle was just doing some testing with nas and then you're like he was testing out the live stream and i was like what the did daniel just go live that was like the funniest thing that ever happened right daniel we're gonna have to show them the bloopers comment comment a thumbs up if you want to see the bloopers of richie panicking because he thought we were going live yeah so i was just like sitting over here and like daniel was just testing out the live stream with all his mic and camera and stuff lighting and he's like uh he's just checking that hey guys this is daniel and it's like uh we have here with us rishi and i'm like i was just sitting over here i'm like what the hell daniel are we alive i didn't even knew daddy i started laughing so hard because you you guys missed that face so comment down thumbs up in the in the chat if you want to see the fire yeah um it was it was like that that was some bad communication on my end because i didn't tell richie we were just testing and that's why communication is important you want to communicate well with the people's interviewing you want to communicate well with your team you want to communicate well with everybody so richie i think it is time for some bonuses so we can make it rain how this meme is making their brain on that i'm the guy in blue and the guy in green is richie [Laughter] so what are some frequently uh questions richie go ahead awesome so uh i think you just went to uh the second question can you just go back is it second order it's the first question well it says okay okay so uh the first question a lot of people would ask us is that should i work unpaid if i have no experience and we get a lot of this kind of question because we have this great community profit with javascript quick clarification richie so these are the frequent questions that people ask us about you know the interview process right not that we're like we're done talking about the interview questions so this is frequently questions of like someone's like hey all right i understand i saw these eight common questions and then they're gonna come with us to these questions so sorry go ahead richie start for interrupting no no no another problem so we get this kind of questions in our community we have profit with joshua we have more than two thousand plus students and it's an amazing course even if even if you are like even if you are if you don't want to buy that course just go and uh check out that course uh just go and search and google clear programmer profit javascript just check out that course uh you'll find a lot of value from that as well and if you are if you have just signed up for uh if you just joined the live stream we have an amazing netflix clone free uh building netflix clone completely free training for you guys so that sign up it's in the description go ahead and click the link in the description sign up for that get your free completely free netflix clone training and we'll be showing you exactly how you can build a netflix clone build that clone learn that skills put that on your resume put that project on your resume and go for that job now let's focus on the question we get a lot of should i work unpaid if i have no experience i think for it it completely depends like i i think i have seen a lot of people who says that no no no there's always a value for your skills in the market i think when you are starting out when you have zero experience and uh when you do not have uh when you're just starting out i would say work for free that doesn't matter because i think when even when i was talking with nas when he graduated from his high school he was working with a sarah for free and i think that's not a bad thing what's your take on that yeah i mean i worked a lot for free because in the beginning i didn't have the experience and i wanted to get the experience so i was willing to put in the time i was willing to put in the effort the blood the sweat the tears all of those things absolutely for free but that allowed me to start to build momentum that allowed me to start to build experience then once i actually had those skills i could charge people whether that was through job or freelancing or whatever that can be yes and so now if you're talking about this when you're working when you're a beginner when you're just starting out and the reason why i can be the perfect person to advise you because i started two years back and i know this even when you're a beginner and when you're starting out like you should work for free because at that point you don't want to work for money you want to work for knowledge in exchange of you want to work there in exchange of knowledge and skills now i think the one advice i would on my end and i have i have been a big fan of tom billow and uh i have this is something he says that like one advice he would or probably even i would give to someone who is just starting out is that like if you're starting out just find the find the find a person you aspire you you inspire you get inspired from that person and who is your idol like if you want to be like someone find it out whom you can contact go to that person tell them that i will work for you for three months or probably two months and i promise you that i will be the best person that you will have ever came across even if i'm working for free and i promise that i will never let you down even if i'm working for free and at the end of that two or three months if you feel that if you want to pay me we are good i will be a team member and if you feel that if you if you don't want to pay me we shake hands but in exchange we share knowledge and connections right daniel and i think that is one of the most important thing and that is the reason you want to work for free for knowledge and connections and connections matters a lot right daniel exactly once you build that skill you could definitely say no and start charging and making sure that you're getting paid so with that being said let's go to the second question we get which is does reference matters what are your thoughts richie completely i think um 90 percent or maybe like not 90 that's a huge skill that i just said maybe 70 to 80 percent of the job that people get it's because of the reference that's what i believe like even though they have the posting on those websites excuse me so the reference matters a lot because even when i'm trying out like if i have a friend if i know a person sorry who is working in that company i would just reach out to that person and i would be like hey bro like hey daniel i see that you're working in blue origin and i was wondering that i have i have been doing a couple of stuff in the past and i can send you my resume and i would be i would really appreciate if if you can get me an interview in blue origin and but at the same time you need to show danielle that why you are responsible because if daniel is taking the responsibility of mine to get me an interview he wants to make sure that i am a smart person so you want to show that person and i think and that is reference matters a lot and reference will will get you a lot of interest now one tip what you can do with reference like if you don't have reference if you want to build up like that is something i i learned from nas is that like uh if you are in that city like let's say that in usa you are in new york and you studied from uh uh the new york state university or whatever nyu uh so you want what you want to do is that you want to go to linkedin you you first of all you guys need to have a good linkedin profile strong linkedin profile so you want to go to linkedin and if you don't have connections just like if you and in new york if you have the headquarters let's say for example for a company and you want to apply to that company go to linkedin and there are filters so what you want to do is go to filter and select nyu and that company in that filter now linkedin is going to show you all the people from your college and from uh that come who are working in that company now what you can do is like reach out to at least five five people that hey bro uh i was in your comp uh i was in your college i we i graduated from uh the same college you graduated and i would really appreciate you if you can help me on few things that i'm looking for a job and i think out of five people at least two people would be happy to help you what's what's your take daniel yeah exactly and the reason uh richie's saying that is because in the end it's not about what you know it's about who you know when you start to network with people when you start to connect with the right people you are going to have the right references to land the right job so again it's not about what you know it's about who you know and maybe you're not happy with that but too bad that's the reality of life if there's two people that you know have the same skills but one of them has a reference in that company the other one doesn't honestly don't want the reference is going to get the job because they already understand or at least one person inside the company or understands how the other person works or they already have that like he said he takes that responsibility of taking it upon himself to help that person get that interview so it's absolutely important to understand who you know and references do matter is there anything else you want to add to this one yeah and when yes yes yes definitely and i think one thing that i would add is that when you are getting a job because of a reference let's say i get in get into blue origin uh because of daniel then if i if i get a job i don't want to let daniel down i don't want to quit the job in one week then it's going to create a very negative impression on daniel i don't want to be like a jerk who don't work who don't submit everything on deadline i because if i i have been referred by daniel it's his responsibility for probably not directly but indirectly it's his responsibility so when you join a job because of someone make sure you don't let them down exactly exactly so if you get the reference don't let them down now the next faq should i lie in my interview and here we got the classic friends joey saying don't you lie to me all right why should they not lie to me richie i think this is pretty obvious but go ahead and tell them why they should not lie because i uh hiding managers are trained of catching lives uh they see in your eyes they're gonna have like even when you're talking to hiding man just see them in in their eyes and they're like they're like so good at catching the lies like if you're gonna say that i'm perfect they'll just catch it and it's just basic questions that they'll like catch your lies in seconds i'm not saying that you should uh completely not lie you might want to hide few things that you don't want to show them that is not relevant but you should never lie in your interview if you don't know some skills like let's say if you don't know uh bootstrap and react just be honest that uh there is one thing that i do not know from the skills but i'm eager to learn because everyone knows over here that like probably if i own a company or probably if someone even just think about that if you own a company if you're looking for a job would you expect that person to be perfect no because no one can be perfect so do not ever lie in your interview never ever do that try to hide few things that are not relevant but that's not same thing as lying yeah it's not even hiding just just don't talk about what you do but no no it's it's all the clear don't lie be honest be transparent nobody likes liars if you lie get the out of here next question what if i mess up in my interview oh man richie i went to my interview i screwed it up i feel bad about myself blah blah blah blah blah poor me what are you gonna tell this person richie when they ask you this question i think uh it's it's this person was me when i started because like when i got when i said when i got some rejections from my interviews and i feel like what then they asked me like some questions and then i mess up and then i block out and then when i messed up i'm like when i closed when i'm done with it i'm like holy what the hell like what kind of person i am to answer a question like that that i'm perfect i don't have any weakness and it's like if you mess up in any in your interviews that is okay because you go through several interviews to land that one job it's okay like you but the key thing is that you learn from every single interview you learn from like if you if you make a mistake uh in that interview and if you keep on repeating that mistake then you are not growing then you should care then you should worry about that but if you just make a when you're a beginner and when you when you mess up in terms that's completely okay no one cares like okay what's the worst case scenario and uh they won't hire you that's okay like i mean still there are hundreds and thousands of jobs waiting for you so don't worry about that just keep your high hopes and but write it down from write it down in a piece of paper that what mistakes you made in that interview now once you have the list of the mistakes work on that mistakes and that's how you kill that next interview you go for in the first interview you make like four mistakes you write in a piece of paper and you try you try to improve that you go to the next interview out of four in the next interview make only two mistakes in the next winter you make one and there will be one interview that will be perfect and then you'll start just killing out so don't worry if you mess up in the interviews that's completely okay you're a human exactly exactly so if you ask us what if i mess up in my interviews i'm gonna say good learn from it don't do it again next question all right what is a super trick to write those big and impressive words on your resume so that when the person reviewing the resume the person interviewing you is going to have this exact same face of shock and amazement and they're going to want to hire you right on the spot richie what we got for them i think this is like a trick that i'm not sure i have seen this post i won't take the credit for this i have seen this post on uh instagram or linkedin by some guy and that guy has a very good trick because like when you're beginning like when i when i started my career like when i had to write that resume i was like holy like when i asked for people like nas and you and that can you guys send me a resume and when i see your resume like nasa's resume and i'm like holy how does this guy have this much of vocabulary like those words are amazing like reduce the productivity by 80 percent uh and reduce the errors and stuff like that like those big questions so how do you write those big impressive words in your resume when you're starting out it's so hard when you're beginning you don't know so go ahead daniel next to the next screen and i will explain them how they can do that go ahead richie so the first thing you want to do is like go to google go to dr google and search for the top 10 jobs from those big companies for the specific position you're looking for let's say you're looking for web developer or let's say you're looking for software developer position so go to google and search for software developer in facebook now you go to the facebook page you go through the descriptions and you figure out like don't just go to facebook go to tesla go to microsoft go to google different kinds of those big companies that have posting go to that join 10 jobs for software developer now read the description the second thing you want to do is first thing is search photos job second thing is read the descriptions and find out 15 to 20 impressive words from those description you can definitely find out more than that but i'm just going to say 15 to 20 those have that impressive words because they always because this company always this kind of big companies they always focus on marketing good so they will always have that clean fancy words on their description so pick out 15 to 20 impressive words paste that in a google document and use now use those in your resume now when you're using that don't forcefully use that just try to figure out a sentence where you can use that just you don't want to use a word that's just um uh that's just not relevant at that time in your resume so make sure you also use third words which are relevant so out of 15 to 20 even if you use like five to ten that's okay so what's what's your take like what do you think about district daniel yeah no that is an amazing thing to start to do and up your resume game basically right because you want to make sure that you know you're not just writing at a first grade level with like like talking like donald trump or whatever right you want to make sure that you can properly communicate your ideas through words through text and when they see the resume they can get an understanding so i think these are some amazing great tips so super trick to land jobs 10 times faster is there anything you want to say before i go into the super trick richie in the next slide no no no no it's gonna be a very good day for you guys to make sure you take notes of this kind of tips but let's go to the next slide bro do it go ahead okay awesome so yep uh awesome it's just uh the last slide for me okay it's gonna be some lag because of youtube but sorry no no it's fine now i think it's just it might be the lag or something but uh yeah so uh first thing you wanna do is that read the description of that job 10 times now the reason why i'm saying this is this trick that uh i i was just uh i went to toronto to one of my relatives and he is a senior software developer and he also sits with a hiring manager when they're hiring developers when they're hiring junior developers because he also lead a team and he knows like what kind of developers they want so he told me this trick because he also sits with those hiring managers when they're entering people so this is the trick first of all read the description of that job ten times even if it takes four hours or even if it takes five hours that's okay it won't probably take four hours it would take probably one hour but read the description of that job ten times like figure out what kind of person they are looking for like what kind of exact person they are looking for second thing is figure out the code relation between you and that jobs responsibilities now you this is very important when you figure out a direct connection between you and that job then 90 chance that you will get the job for sure because you have a reason uh that they should hire you because you are directly connected to that job the third thing that is use those and make a resume and cv that has exactly all the qualities required for that job now the first thing is when you when you read the description you figure out that what kind of person what kind of uh what are the requirements of that job and then based on those recommend you make a resume which makes you an ideal candidate for that job like you have all the skills that are listed or probably if you know all the skills put down all the skills if you don't know all the skill uh maybe uh just don't put that skill but let's say let's say 90 of the skill and uh if they're looking for a web developer you have all the projects on your resume that consists of all the websites you made and and then apply for that job so then if you have a perfect resume and cv and that that and there's a human connection right they will feel that okay i see his description in his uh cover letter and i feel that this guy would be ideal candidate for this job so these are the four steps you want to do with the job description figure out the correlation between you and that uh that job use that to make a resume in cv and then apply for that job and i swear that this will help you to get that job like 10x faster than a normal uh normally because you just probably what all people would do is that they would just use the same resume and apply to like hundreds of jobs right daniel what's your take hold on bless you thank you yes i agree if you do these four steps you're gonna stand out because no one else is doing these things like if you are the one guy out of 100 people who does this you're going to stand out you're going to get the job you're going to get the interview if you do these things that we talked about you're going to crush that interview and you're going to land your job as a developer freelancer or working in corporate america whatever that may be so do these four steps take another screenshot go you know go through this whole thing again to know exactly what you need to answer for every single thing so give them that tip in this last part richie yep awesome sorry so the tip is that uh this is a great tip that i realize so if you are all so always always have a local address if you are applying to a different city or province so let's say that uh i live in uh in canada i live in ottawa and i want to apply for a job in vancouver and so what happens is that uh when you send out their resume you probably have an address that you live right now so i would probably have an address that i live right now that is uh for ottawa and when i apply to that job they would first consider a person who is in vancouver so what you want to do is that figure out uh figure out if you have a connection in vancouver and uh tell them that hey bro i just want to use your address on my resume now this is not a bad thing that's completely okay because they personal most of the times they hire local people because that that has happened to me like applied to a job in category and then uh those people would really like my resume they had an injury but they told me that they are looking for someone who is local over here because then i also told them that i can move but still it's not gonna work out so they always gonna want someone who is local so this is a very good team always always always use the local address of that city or province you are applying for awesome so that's the tip and that's the last tip we wanted to give you and i think uh one note you can take from here yeah you can take from the here is that different job requires different resume and cv like you cannot just apply with the same resume in cv for every job if it's like a react job you can you would have to show some react skills and react project if it's a javascript then you would have to show javascript plain javascript but it requires different resume a different cv for every job don't use the same ones make some changes to that so i think uh that is all from me and daniel we created this presentation for you guys and i hope you guys enjoyed the top eight common questions and i i think now you guys have a better understanding of uh what uh understanding how you can answer those questions in a better way and it's okay if you have joined right now if you have missed it just go back and start screenshoting those answers write down in a piece of paper practice it but make sure that when you're answering those they should not feel that you are just like uh reading a written text be natural when you're answering that pre get prepared for that obviously uh uh but don't be 100 natural don't be uh someone who just read something that is written in a piece of paper so you also want to make sure about that so i hope you enjoyed that and i think uh if you uh we we would take some questions at this point so guys if you have like any questions uh please drop it in the comments and before you are dropping it uh i just want to say that the people who have joined right now um we have organized a free netflix clone training for you that's completely free go sign up the link is in the description and it's completely free get that project on your portfolio so i think one question daniel uh i got i i realized that uh that i we need to answer is that there was a guy who asked like it was couple of times back that a person asked that uh do you need a degree to get a job in web developer what's your take daniel you do not need a degree to get a job as a web developer what you need is experience so sometimes a degree can get you some experience but other times going to clever programmer and building a netflix clone could get you the experience you need to be able to land your first job so you do not need a degree a degree might help be helpful for some people depending on your situation if you're not one of those people that can go out there and learn by yourself or if you're not willing to you know put the time in with clever programmer to learn the right applications and it might be worth going to school so that someone could tell you how to do it and what to do but even then that's not guaranteed because in the end what's guaranteed is experience so even if you go to school and go get your degree make sure you're getting that experience make sure you're building out the portfolio make sure you're building out projects and getting your hands dirty so that you actually show your problem solver is there anything you want to add to that richie awesome so uh i think no that's a very good explanation i don't think that you need a degree to get a job in web developer because i think most of the successful developers are selfeducated so i don't think you need that i think another question another important question we have from here is from nikhil nikhil satis he says that what is a role of a portfolio website for a developer i think it's mandatory nowadays uh i think even a lot of people have started asking like when you go and apply for a job for jobs in north america uh most of the companies have started asking for a link that is for about your portfolio because the reason why they ask this because you cannot show them everything on a resume you cannot have a 10 page resume explaining everything you do right you can have only one page resume and a cover letter and then you link them to portfolio that shows all your projects that you have done in previous that shows all other stuff like whatever you want to show them but i think it's very mandatory right now and uh that will also make you stand out from a lot of people so i think it's mandatory right now so yep uh i think uh if you guys have more questions uh so there is one guy who asked that is it important to have a degree of engineer uh for computer science so as as daniel said that it's not necessary it's all about experience so get your experience like start building those projects like my advice if you're a beginner my advice would be like if if you don't have a degree and if you're a beginner my advice would be like start investing in yourself with those ten dollars or fifteen dollars instead of going into that ten dollars or fifteen dollars courses start investing in yourself like if the more you invest like i understand like if you don't wanna go for that like even if it's like start hiring a mentor even if it's not me even if it's not anybody but not now start hiring mentors and if you have that budget go sign up for a profit with javascript course and and even if you don't want to buy that course there are going to be a lot of free resources like just stay tuned with clear programmer we are providing some value bombs we are building some amazing clones so uh you can definitely learn from that but the key point is keep on learning and keep on having that uh practical experience instead of just going to the theoretical experience and also work for free even if you have to like in the beginning exactly that's how you can get that experience see we have another question which is how to connect with people in linkedin out of 100 people only 10 respond so richie gave a great tip which nas gave him which is find people who have gone to your university and then request friendship from them because usually because there's that connection of hey we went to the same school and they work at some spot that i want to work on they're more than likely to say yes but you can start to get creative don't just spam everyone be creative ask for people that happen to be in the company want to work at or ask for people that have that same common uh work experience or school experience or whatever that may be is there anything else you want to add to that richie no no for sure 100 so i think yeah yeah go for it awesome yeah so i think there is a guy who says that uh what projects do you recommend for a backend developer i would say that for a weekend developer do projects that are that we are building right now with uh sunny we also built an amazon clone and we will be soon releasing an amazon clone whole big tutorial uh and there are a lot of things that you can do but even if you're a backend developer try to even if you're backing up front end doesn't matter when you when you applying for a job don't have that projects like uh calculator and a small website and stuff like that i think it's good i'm not saying that you should not build that it's good when you're learning but don't expect a job based on those projects how does real projects like amazon clone if it's spotify clone or something like that and even in amazon clone we have built the whole uh back end and front end where we had the challenge so build projects like that instead of just having those small projects it doesn't matter what projects you build exactly i'm just looking for another job so there's a guy uh atishai jane he says that from where can i start the freelancer job so there are different platforms that you can go to start your freelancer so i first thing i would recommend is that uh do not go to upwork because it is something that you want to transition after you are professional first go with freelancer.com and maybe if you if you want to go with fiverr fiverr is a great website as well it's picking up right now so uh you can go with fiverr as well and it's freelancer.com but even when you're when you're freelancing you need to learn a lot of stuff just make sure that the initial two or three months is gonna be hard because uh you don't know how to reach out to clients you don't know how to bid on projects so it's gonna be hard but make sure to invest and learn all those stuff once you learn it it's gonna be like this any other questions richie or is that it so uh yeah so nikhil has uh another question as well that uh you did talk about a local address now how do i actually show a local address like of course i'm gonna just relocate there based on getting the job or not how do i show a local address so probably and there was a guy even uh he said that you guys said that you should not lie in uh in your interview and uh you are saying that you should add a local address so that's that's probably like so it is not lying we did not say it is not like you're you're putting up a local address you it's not like you're probably gonna move there so it's not lying it's completely okay it's gonna increase your chances it's just that you're putting up address and then nickel answering your questions uh just find out someone who lives in that city probably you can definitely find out someone who can live who lives in that city so i think that's how you can do that uh yeah i don't think there's another way you can do it and honestly if you can't then there's no big deal just put your address and then you know i mean you just don't get that extra advantage of if that company happens to be looking for someone local but if you look if you try to apply for big tech they don't give a what city you live in right i mean that's only more like a local little company so don't even stress about it i mean if you can find someone and they're comfortable with it sure go ahead and do it if not then who cares like it's not a big issue it's just a little extra tip and then in terms of again the point about lang if i mean if you're not going to relocate then yeah that's i mean then don't do that right but if you're willing to relocate then you can just go ahead and do that like there's there's really no harm because you're just putting yourself that extra little advantage that that it's like if they search locally you get they're gonna look they're gonna find your portfolio yep yep and uh there is a guy priyanshu sheriff i believe he's uh he's in pwg as well and he says that he's asking that which is the best platform for tutoring so uh for i think i believe that what he's asking that what is the best platform from where he can start teaching people i think there are a lot of a lot of platforms where you can start tutoring but uh personally i think that uh there are a lot of website but personally what you can do is that you can reach out to people on facebook just go to just find in the search bar just go to like just type html css and javascript if that is what you want to teach go to those group those groups make sure those groups don't allow promotion so go to those groups figure out what people are looking for those tutors like they're not going to be direct that i'm looking for a tutor they're gonna be like uh i want to learn html css what are the best resources they might ask questions like this so reach out to them personally do not comment on that or something like that or maybe even if comment on that and help them out and then when you provide them on value reach out to them personally direct message them and have a marketing message something like hey if you are facing problems with building website with html css javascript i can help you but first like provide them a free call and if they feel that it's valuable then they would take uh uh call tutoring with you but i think that is something that i know and i have used in past but there are i believe there are a couple of websites that also does that so if you if you think that you want to do that on high scale go for it i think in the one video kazi also talks about those tutoring uh uh websites and i think it's it's with uh sunny that he talks about i'm not just sure what do is that cool i think so uh the last question we can answer is that asuria saxena she says that uh algorithm and data structures knowledge is necessary to correct coding interviews what what do you say daniel on that it depends on who you're interviewing with you're going to interview with big tech like google microsoft and all those things yes you do need to know the big technical algorithm type interviews because that's gonna be a big part but very often if you're just gonna interview at a local company sometimes they really don't even ask that they just care about the stuff that we talked about today which is showing your experience making sure that you're a nice person to talk with that you're gonna fight well with the team and they're gonna love working with you and they might not even ask you a single algorithm question so reality depends where you want to apply to and where you're trying to get some jobs yep and just to add to that i had one of my friends she was my classmate and one thing that fascinated me was she got a job as a web developer and in toronto and that person that company is a transportation company that company didn't even ask her a single technical question it was just a soft skill and at that point i was not able to believe i was like how the hell they like they don't even know their technical ability so sometimes like when you are starting out they don't care a lot about technical skills because you know that they know that if you're graduating uh if you graduated uh and if if you are here and if you have the skills listed you know a lot of stuff if you have that portfolio and if there if if you lack on some stuff they have the people to train you right so sometimes they would not even consider or bother having their technical interview if you are really good in those soft skills into you exactly exactly cool man so awesome so i think yeah i
