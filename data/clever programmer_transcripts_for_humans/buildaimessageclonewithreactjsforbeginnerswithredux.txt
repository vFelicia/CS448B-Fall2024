00:59 - authentication
01:01 - everything is powered with redux so this
01:02 - is a for imessage clone
01:04 - and you can pretty much see it supports
01:06 - everything we want so let's go ahead and
01:08 - say
01:08 - yo this is insane
01:12 - and there you go and even has those nice
01:14 - little animations so if you guys
01:16 - want to see how to build that let me
01:18 - know right now
01:19 - get that energy up guys and we can go
01:22 - ahead and get this thing built
01:23 - uh for you guys so today's actually a
01:26 - pretty fun build
01:27 - we've got a lot going on here we have
01:30 - material ui
01:31 - we have all that fun stuff we have
01:33 - material ui we have firebase support in
01:36 - the back end so we have a real time
01:37 - back end right now here so let me go
01:40 - ahead and draw oh this is yesterday's
01:41 - session
01:42 - let's go ahead and show you guys so
01:43 - we've got a bit of material ui
01:45 - going on over here for these little
01:47 - icons the avatars
01:49 - being used over here we've got a really
01:51 - nice use case of flexbox
01:53 - in today's build and everything that you
01:56 - see here is powered
01:57 - by firebase so we're going to show you
02:00 - guys how to go ahead and
02:02 - power this up using firebase and then
02:04 - once that's done
02:06 - we're going to pretty much go ahead and
02:08 - completely get this thing built out with
02:10 - redux
02:11 - so redux is going to support everything
02:12 - it's pretty much how the user
02:14 - authentication is being stored at the
02:16 - moment
02:16 - so how we know which users logged in so
02:18 - right now obviously i'm the latest chat
02:19 - but let's go ahead and refresh this
02:21 - and you can see it signs me in
02:22 - automatically let's go ahead and sign
02:24 - out
02:24 - and sign back in as let's say i'm going
02:26 - to sign into cardi's account
02:28 - let's check this out um
02:31 - let's go ahead and check it out so now
02:33 - i'm in let's go ahead and see so now it
02:35 - says yellow
02:36 - and this one and here i'm going to say
02:38 - yo what's up sunny
02:39 - so i'm pretending to be kazzy right now
02:41 - and there you go comes up as kazi
02:43 - so it's kazzy's message right here and
02:45 - he says yo what's up sunny
02:47 - and what you can also do is you can
02:48 - actually create new channels so this
02:50 - button right here will actually go ahead
02:52 - and prompt out
02:53 - um i think it's hiding the prompt from
02:55 - me right now but this button right here
02:56 - basically when we click it
02:57 - yeah there we go uh and it's going to
02:59 - pop up saying enter our chat noise let's
03:00 - go ahead and type in youtube
03:02 - boom and we get a youtube channel and
03:05 - say
03:06 - let's go let's go guys let's
03:11 - go let me do a rocket emoji there we go
03:15 - and there we go guys so everything is up
03:16 - and running and it's all
03:18 - pretty good okay um let's go ahead and
03:22 - see
03:22 - i think everyone if you can see me right
03:24 - now in the build uh in the stream let me
03:26 - know in the comments i see some people
03:28 - freaking out about the glitching and
03:29 - stuff like that but it will be
03:30 - completely back up and running
03:32 - uh so don't worry about that if it's

05:05 - dude i agree so with that said guys
05:09 - let's go ahead and give you one more run
05:10 - through of the app so this is the app

05:16 - going to do at the end if you stick
05:17 - around to the end
05:18 - so for everyone who's going to stick
05:20 - around to the end you guys are actually
05:21 - going to go ahead and get a chance to
05:22 - play with the app right so it's going to
05:24 - be pretty much fully functional you guys
05:25 - can see it working
05:26 - you can see everything built out and how
05:29 - we deploy and how we do all those that
05:30 - fun stuff
05:31 - um and also we just hit 300 people
05:33 - watching right now so
05:34 - amazing stuff guys thank you for the
05:36 - positive energy the love and support you
05:39 - guys
05:39 - always dropping and if you're ready for
05:41 - this build guys
05:42 - smash the thumbs up button let me know
05:45 - let's get this video out to so many more
05:47 - people
05:48 - so that way we can get um yeah we can
05:50 - get as much value out there as possible
05:51 - we're at 300 viewers
05:53 - that's insane um okay so one more
05:56 - run through of the app here is the app
05:58 - guys supports all of the google login
06:00 - functionality so if i go ahead and click
06:01 - sign
06:02 - in we've got all of our google login so
06:04 - you can see here's google authentication
06:06 - powered by firebase and then you've got
06:07 - this lovely react flip move animation so
06:10 - you see that guys
06:11 - that's pretty dope that's pretty clean
06:13 - right
06:14 - so with that said um let me know guys as
06:18 - well if you have actually gone ahead and
06:19 - used
06:20 - um redux before so if anyone's used
06:23 - redux before
06:24 - let me know because redux is something
06:26 - which is you're all gonna find super
06:27 - super valuable
06:28 - inside of a commercial environment so
06:30 - all of that good stuff
06:32 - they ask for redux experience um oh nice
06:35 - johanna's
06:36 - johannes sorry if i pronounced that one
06:38 - let's go papa react johannes from
06:40 - live from south africa starting my
06:41 - internship on monday good stuff dude
06:44 - good luck for your internship and that's
06:46 - what we're talking about
06:47 - um somebody says what's the difference
06:49 - between react
06:50 - js and redux so react.js is the library
06:53 - that we use to build progressive web
06:54 - apps
06:54 - uh redux is how it's called a state
06:56 - management library so it's pretty much
06:58 - how we manage
06:59 - the flow of data inside of the app so
07:01 - how we pretty much store everything
07:03 - inside of our date and inside of our app
07:05 - and go through all that cool stuff so
07:07 - we're going to pretty much go ahead and
07:08 - do that
07:09 - um right so
07:12 - uh garveet says hey sony has used this
07:14 - yesterday to completely show my bills
07:16 - off to my father
07:17 - so dude honestly if he's uh not willing
07:19 - to spend it it's completely fine just
07:21 - carry on doing it man like you can
07:22 - pretty much go ahead and keep learning
07:24 - and you can pretty much go like as far
07:26 - as you can go like and there's no limit
07:28 - you don't need to have special
07:31 - special materials or anything like that
07:32 - you can pretty much go ahead and just
07:33 - practice
07:34 - coding abilities and you know keep
07:36 - pushing your skill set and
07:38 - keep it good vibes you know positive
07:39 - energy and that's what we want to do so

09:51 - lag issues that we're having right now
09:53 - um yeah everything will have a way of
09:55 - figuring itself out
09:56 - so we're going to go ahead and use this
09:58 - command so it's mpx create react app but
10:00 - we're using dash dash template
10:02 - and then redux right so let's go ahead
10:05 - and open up a terminal

10:16 - react app
10:18 - and then rather than so here you
10:21 - basically say npx create react app and
10:22 - then the message of your app so here i'm
10:24 - going to go ahead and say

10:48 - to the clever programmer team for
10:49 - helping upcoming and existing force in
10:51 - industry
10:52 - um you guys are about to shift the
10:53 - paradigm dude that's exactly what we're
10:55 - aiming for honestly i i
10:57 - went to university and i found that like
10:58 - it's completely outdated everything is
11:00 - completely like you know
11:01 - it's just not really like it's not what
11:04 - you really need in the industry
11:06 - so we're trying to shift all of that and

11:09 - like uh the most sort of critical pieces
11:12 - of content and
11:13 - critical value to you guys and provide
11:15 - you with all that value so that way when
11:16 - you get into that sort of
11:18 - workplace or commercial environment you
11:19 - guys can just thrive and you guys can
11:21 - kill it
11:21 - okay uh and i agree with this good to
11:23 - see so many young programmers in the
11:25 - chat

11:49 - and um we're gonna absolutely crush it
11:51 - today so jumping into the build
11:53 - we can see our terminal command just
11:55 - finished off so now we're going to go
11:57 - ahead and do cd imessage clone youtube
12:00 - and we're going to be inside of it and
12:01 - then i'm going to do code dash insiders
12:04 - for you guys it'll be the code dot but
12:07 - for me i've got the beta edition
12:09 - and then you want to go ahead and start
12:11 - up so this school should
12:12 - pop it up uh because

12:38 - in a while nice to see you back on the
12:39 - streams
12:40 - um okay so now what we're gonna do is

12:44 - um for some reason spectacle's not
12:46 - working
12:47 - oh man okay my keyboard shortcuts aren't
12:50 - working one sec
12:52 - bear with me guys it's always like when
12:55 - i'm on
12:55 - live streams there we go all right so

12:59 - is go ahead and some reason this doesn't
13:01 - want to behave
13:03 - um all right give me one sec let me go
13:06 - ahead and open up a new terminal
13:08 - like this uh
13:11 - i wish i could build a book one on one
13:13 - coaching with sonny you can book a
13:14 - one-on-one coaching with me
13:16 - um why is my god damn it um
13:20 - okay never mind we can pretty much do it
13:22 - this way so with that said guys
13:26 - i'm gonna okay i need this shortcut give
13:29 - me one sec

13:48 - now yay there we go guys so i use this
13:51 - i don't know if you guys know but i use
13:54 - this keyboard shortcut quite a lot
13:56 - and without it i think my build time
13:58 - would be extremely long
14:00 - so that's what i was trying to get to
14:02 - right now so i'm gonna close
14:03 - this one give me one sec guys one second
14:08 - there we go we're back we're back right

14:15 - about see
14:17 - it doesn't seem like much but trust me
14:20 - to be able to do that very quickly on a
14:22 - live stream it's very important so
14:24 - yeah and also guys yeah quick question
14:26 - who would buy some

14:47 - to go ahead and start up the app and
14:49 - while that's happening
14:50 - um it will actually go ahead and start
14:53 - up in localhost 3000
14:54 - so that's what we're going to do right
14:56 - here so this is our app

15:14 - redux so redox is a state management
15:15 - tool
15:16 - and that's going to help you guys go
15:18 - ahead and manage the data flow inside of
15:20 - an app so here if i go ahead and do 20
15:22 - add amount you see adds by 20s if i do
15:24 - add async it's a little delay and that's
15:26 - meant to mimic
15:27 - the sort of network request and things
15:29 - like that okay um
15:33 - uh paulo says why using code and sizes
15:36 - uh so i'm actually i just like i'm a big
15:37 - fan of like beta tools i kind of messed
15:39 - around with beta stuff so
15:40 - you know go ahead and check out gaming
15:42 - mat says hoodies would be cool i know
15:44 - dude that's what i'm thinking like a
15:45 - like you know black hoodie with upper
15:47 - reactor still
15:48 - um yeah well we'll go into that in a bit
15:50 - so right now what we're going to do is
15:52 - the cleanup process
15:53 - so we're gonna go ahead and delete the
15:55 - app.test.js logo
15:57 - and setup tests.js over here move that
16:00 - to the trash
16:01 - and then we're gonna get this the app's
16:03 - gonna start freaking out so
16:05 - a few more things we're gonna do we're
16:07 - going to go inside of app.js delete
16:08 - everything inside of the header okay so
16:10 - we're going to go ahead and remove all
16:11 - of that
16:12 - say h1 and we're going to go ahead and
16:15 - say
16:16 - um
16:19 - nice powder says you have changed my
16:21 - life uh so yeah that's awesome stuff
16:23 - dude
16:24 - good stuff right here i'm going to say
16:26 - let's build
16:27 - the i message clone
16:31 - dope all right so we're going to go
16:32 - ahead and do that and then in
16:34 - the top here i'm gonna get rid of lines
16:36 - three and two
16:37 - save it go into app.css command a delete
16:40 - everything you don't want any
16:42 - pre-styling before we start in index.css
16:45 - i'm gonna show you guys
16:46 - we get this annoying bit of spacing at
16:49 - the top right
16:50 - so you see over here there's this a
16:52 - normal sort of uh
16:54 - annoying little gap over here we're
16:56 - going to get rid of that right now by
16:57 - going to the top
16:58 - going ahead doing asterisks and then
17:01 - saying margin
17:02 - colon zero and this will go ahead and
17:04 - reset the margins and now
17:05 - we have a starting canvas okay so that's
17:08 - going to be really really
17:09 - uh nice to start with um so
17:12 - with that said guys stop freaking out i
17:14 - can hear i can see so many people saying
17:16 - like i can't hear you yes you can
17:17 - i mean i can see the levels you guys can
17:19 - definitely hear me um
17:21 - right so with that said i'm going to go
17:23 - back to aptos yes let's get rid of that
17:26 - and then now well you see this features
17:30 - on the left right so features on the
17:32 - left what i want you guys to go ahead
17:33 - and do
17:34 - is go ahead and you want to first get
17:37 - rid of counter
17:38 - dot js encounter module we're not going
17:40 - to need those and then
17:42 - pull count a slice outside the photo
17:45 - right then you're going to see counter
17:47 - right here i'm going to right click
17:48 - click on delete because we don't want
17:50 - that folder that's actually a folder
17:51 - inside of features
17:52 - then i'm going to grab counter size and
17:54 - put it back in features
17:55 - so now should have a folder with that
17:58 - counter slice inside of right
18:00 - um hey fujiko's in the house what's up

18:12 - we're going to do is don't worry about
18:14 - all the jargon inside of here just yet
18:16 - but you see right now it's freaking out
18:18 - so we need to go to app store.js
18:20 - uh and then here you're going to pretty
18:22 - much go ahead get rid of the counter
18:25 - save it and that will get us to our
18:27 - starting point okay
18:29 - um so loads of people are always asking
18:31 - about what that command was why
18:33 - i first used so it was like something
18:34 - like this where i did code insiders dash
18:37 - right um dot
18:38 - so what you want to do is command shift
18:40 - p inside of code inside or inside of
18:43 - your vs code
18:46 - oh man bless you again hey fever already
18:50 - um so what we're going to do and yeah i
18:52 - will slow down in a sec this is just
18:53 - because this is the starting point
18:55 - so here we're going to go ahead and do
18:57 - shell command
18:59 - and then we're going to say install code

20:00 - and this is for the bem naming
20:01 - convention okay
20:03 - so this is known as bem naming
20:04 - convention so this is how you name your
20:07 - classes
20:08 - and react to make it more sort of easier
20:10 - to work with easier to scale and that
20:12 - sort of stuff okay
20:13 - so with that said we're gonna go ahead
20:16 - and
20:17 - start the first part of the build so the
20:19 - first thing i want to do guys is

21:05 - sorry
21:06 - and the sidebar component so this thing
21:08 - over here right
21:09 - so we're going to go ahead and do that
21:10 - first so the first thing
21:13 - is um psycho coda says sonny do you
21:15 - remember the debate over bam comment in
21:17 - one

21:31 - otherwise you're gonna get blocked and
21:33 - you're not coming back all right
21:34 - so now we're gonna go ahead and create
21:37 - and what i'm gonna do today is i'm gonna
21:38 - show you why
21:39 - i'm gonna create an imessage component
21:41 - right so this is gonna have this entire
21:43 - app inside of it
21:45 - and this one i'm going to go ahead and
21:46 - create right now because it's going to
21:48 - freak out because there's no imessage
21:50 - component
21:52 - whoa check this out
21:56 - gabriel damn dude he goes
21:59 - come on everyone show your support this
22:01 - channel is cheaper than

22:05 - appreciate you gabriel that is
22:07 - insane uh huge 20 donation
22:10 - uh thank you so much and yeah that is
22:12 - that really really awesome stuff and
22:13 - that's the kind of energy that we want
22:15 - in this channel
22:16 - this is the kind of people we want in
22:17 - this channel thank you so much dude
22:18 - appreciate you
22:20 - uh somebody also says do you love yeah i
22:22 - mean i i'm interested in fly i know
22:24 - kelly hayden does a lot of flat stuff so
22:26 - i've been looking in that space as well
22:28 - um so i'm going to create
22:30 - i'm going to create a component called
22:33 - imessage.js
22:34 - right and then i'm going to use my
22:35 - beautiful rfce trick
22:37 - to go ahead and create the snippet and
22:40 - then i'm going to say import
22:42 - imessage imessage.css
22:46 - i'm going to create a corresponding css
22:48 - file so now we go back and it's going to
22:50 - freak out so we're going to create an
22:52 - imessage dss file so imessage.css
22:56 - and then you guys are going to go ahead
22:57 - and see that it's still freaking out and
22:58 - this is because inside of app.js we need
23:01 - to import
23:04 - so i'm going to say import imessage
23:07 - from imessage
23:12 - imessage there we go what's my thing
23:15 - acting all with okay
23:16 - yeah and now pretty much i'm going to
23:17 - render the entire app in here okay
23:19 - so this is going to be there is a
23:20 - purpose for this and it will show you
23:22 - exactly
23:22 - how we're going to do that soon um but
23:25 - for now
23:25 - i want you guys to do is go ahead and
23:27 - type in imessage here and
23:29 - then we're going to go to our code and
23:32 - this is not going to be camel case just
23:34 - for simplicity
23:35 - yeah because sometimes some people might
23:37 - do it you know capital m some people
23:39 - might not so we're going to keep it
23:40 - super simple
23:41 - going back we've got there are two
23:43 - things inside of here right
23:44 - we've got the sidebar and we've got the
23:46 - chat that's what i mentioned before so
23:48 - if we go back to our app before we had
23:50 - the sidebar and the chat
23:51 - so um where's my drawing tools
23:54 - my beautiful drawing tools all right so
23:56 - now we've got this sidebar element
23:59 - right and then we've got this chat
24:01 - element okay so i'm going to create
24:02 - those two here so that's what we've got
24:04 - over here
24:05 - so that's why i like to do this little
24:07 - commenting right here because it helps
24:08 - you sort of
24:09 - you know piece together what you're
24:11 - going to have inside of the app
24:12 - um so call mile says when would you do a
24:16 - class
24:16 - function verse functional i would say
24:18 - always triangle with functional
24:19 - functions more the modern approach and
24:21 - you should be able to go and check that
24:23 - instead um hey daniel says yo papa react
24:27 - what's up dude glad to see you in in in
24:30 - today's video so what we're going to do
24:32 - is we're going to first build the
24:33 - sidebar right
24:34 - so i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar
24:37 - go ahead create the file
24:39 - so sidebar dot js
24:42 - rfce i'm going to go ahead and shut that
24:45 - down and then here i'm gonna say
24:47 - this is the sort of you know the setup
24:48 - every time we create a new component
24:50 - we're gonna create the css file that
24:52 - goes along with it we go ahead and set
24:54 - up the div with the bem naming
24:55 - convention so here i'm gonna say
24:57 - sidebar boom done and i'm going to write
24:59 - h2 saying i
25:00 - am the sidebar there we go and then i'm
25:03 - going to go over here create the
25:05 - sidebar.css
25:07 - and there we go all right so we have
25:09 - that done go over to imessage and let's
25:11 - go ahead and pop an import on this
25:13 - so i'm going to actually make this a
25:14 - little bit bigger for you guys so that
25:16 - way you guys can see it there we go
25:18 - um and then here i'm going to say import
25:21 - why isn't my clever little trick working
25:23 - oh yeah there we go
25:25 - so control space by the end of the line
25:27 - here and it will go ahead and import it
25:28 - for you
25:29 - and then we can go ahead and do uh thank
25:32 - you so much to
25:33 - to fikou rahman's tommy

25:48 - thumbs up button because we hear a
25:49 - thousand likes to them yesterday and i
25:51 - think we can go ahead
25:53 - and um we can break a thousand today as
25:55 - well so if lucha code elizabeth says
25:56 - that trick is a game changer along with
25:58 - emmett
25:59 - 100 it makes you such a faster developer
26:02 - right so that's gonna be really really
26:04 - cool for you
26:05 - um oh why papa meron popper is not
26:08 - popping up today
26:09 - hey david will be back in the channel
26:11 - hey i'm gonna give i'm gonna let david
26:12 - know that he said that
26:13 - um so we've got the sidebar here right
26:16 - so what i'm gonna do
26:17 - is actually render it out so you see it
26:18 - says i am the sidebar so we know it's
26:20 - working
26:21 - um somebody says is it too late to start
26:23 - coding at 17 hell no dude
26:25 - start as soon as you want or later you
26:27 - want doesn't matter man
26:28 - just start all right the next thing i'm
26:30 - going to do is create the chat component
26:32 - so actually let's go ahead and build out
26:33 - the sidebar first
26:34 - all right so
26:38 - um ayush patel says it's 1.5 k now for
26:40 - yesterday damn
26:41 - yeah so like see we're making moves on
26:43 - that so sidebar
26:44 - let's go here and what i'm going to do
26:45 - is you guys like this when i did this
26:47 - yesterday
26:48 - i'm going to drop the sidebar underneath
26:51 - my code like this so you can see my css
26:53 - underneath and my code at the top
26:54 - that's a kind of easier way to visualize
26:56 - it as well so i think it might help you
26:58 - guys out
26:59 - now the first thing we're going to do is
27:00 - i'm going to have a header section so
27:01 - the header section
27:03 - is going to reference this bit over here
27:06 - okay so this is the
27:07 - the sidebar header so i'm going to go
27:09 - over here and create a div
27:11 - called sidebar i'm going to say header
27:13 - okay so over here we've got the div with
27:15 - the sidebar header
27:16 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
27:18 - going to create another one and this
27:19 - one's going to be called sidebar chat so
27:22 - div sidebar i'm just going to score
27:24 - chats
27:25 - and that's going to be responsible for
27:27 - you guessed it these
27:29 - this list of chats over here okay so
27:33 - we're going to go ahead and do that
27:34 - right now inside of sidebar header so
27:37 - you see we use
27:38 - we use material ui in a bunch of places
27:40 - right now we've got it for this icon
27:42 - right here
27:43 - we're going for this icon over here so
27:45 - the avatar being shown over here
27:47 - and we're going for this little pencil
27:48 - icon that we use to create a new channel
27:50 - so in order to do that we need to go
27:52 - ahead and install material ui
27:54 - right those people asking what's the
27:56 - best way to then react just watch this
27:57 - channel man
27:58 - watch this channel watch the builds go
28:00 - ahead and do that and that will be your
28:02 - quickest most effective way of doing it
28:04 - so we're going to go here i'm going to
28:05 - do material ui.com
28:08 - so you can just google it and it should
28:09 - pop up then you want to run this command
28:11 - npm install material ui
28:12 - call right so this command is very
28:14 - important right now
28:16 - so then what i'm going to do is go back
28:19 - to my terminal so i'm going to hit
28:20 - command j to bring up
28:22 - terminal right now we have it running
28:23 - here i'm going to hit this little plus
28:25 - icon
28:25 - and we should see a second terminal pop
28:27 - up and then i'm going to go ahead and do
28:28 - npm install material ui core
28:30 - right anthony what's up dude he says yo
28:33 - sonny
28:34 - uh that's awesome just dude oh sorry i
28:37 - was responding to another comment as i
28:38 - had that one pinned
28:39 - um right
28:44 - yeah still okay so with that done we're
28:46 - going to install that
28:47 - then we're going to go back here go to
28:48 - the top where it says search
28:50 - and then i'm going to say icons and
28:51 - thank you so much for charlie for
28:53 - putting a little code snippet in the
28:54 - chat that will help a lot of people out
28:56 - here with the installation i'm going to
28:58 - go ahead and do material ui icon so we
29:00 - need to install the core
29:02 - and the icon set okay so those are two
29:05 - things that we need to do
29:06 - to get started um if you guys are
29:08 - enjoying this by the way let me know
29:12 - we'll keep the builds coming
29:15 - all right so
29:19 - back to the build here now i'm going to
29:22 - hit command j to hide it
29:24 - and the first thing i'm going to do is
29:26 - at the top over here
29:27 - i'm going to have
29:30 - the so we have the avatar right
29:34 - so i'm going to go here and i'm going to
29:35 - say avatar
29:37 - and then here i'm going to say source
29:39 - right now the source at this point we
29:42 - don't have an image for it so i'm just
29:43 - going to leave this blank
29:44 - okay and this will go ahead and it'll
29:46 - pop like a dummy avatar in
29:48 - so it says avatar is not defined so here
29:49 - i'm going to hit control space at the
29:51 - end it says auto import from material ui
29:53 - gives me the import statement um
29:57 - i'm going to go ahead and save it
29:58 - refresh avatar is not defined
30:00 - should be defined now
30:04 - so let's go ahead and refresh we should
30:07 - see it there we go
30:08 - all right so it says i'm the sidebar and
30:09 - we've got the avatar popping up which is
30:11 - the little icon right here
30:12 - uh mando loves the emma emmett trick
30:14 - yeah obviously emmitt is insane man and
30:16 - it makes you such a fast decoder so
30:18 - make sure you take full advantage of
30:20 - that the next thing we're gonna do is
30:21 - create sidebar underscore underscore
30:23 - input
30:24 - boom i'm gonna do that oops input
30:28 - and then i'm gonna go ahead and inside
30:30 - of here i'm gonna have a few things i'm
30:32 - gonna have to search
30:33 - icon right so the search icon we can
30:36 - pull in from material ui so i've got the
30:38 - import up here
30:40 - so i'm going to go ahead and pull that
30:41 - in
30:43 - i'm going to close this to make it
30:44 - easier for you guys to see
30:47 - and then and then i'm going to go back
30:50 - down
30:51 - and create an input right so this is
30:53 - going to be an input
30:54 - the placeholder of search so you see
30:57 - right now we're starting to pop out some
30:58 - of the stuff
30:59 - now we don't need to say i am the
31:00 - sidebar we don't really care about that
31:02 - also where we say let's build the
31:03 - messenger clone imessage coming here and
31:05 - that
31:07 - so going back here we're going to go
31:09 - ahead and do
31:10 - so and david to work on that bro so
31:13 - loads of people are looking forward to
31:14 - the imessage
31:15 - uh to the react native stuff it's coming
31:18 - just bear with me okay
31:19 - it's coming guys it's coming it's a lot
31:21 - of work going on behind the scenes
31:22 - um yeah it's definitely on his way um
31:25 - then we're gonna go ahead and after this
31:27 - we're gonna have
31:29 - the another icon button right so we're
31:31 - gonna have
31:32 - that little icon over here you guys see
31:35 - i'm gonna go ahead and pull that in
31:37 - so the thing to go ahead and do that is
31:39 - it's actually called this
31:40 - right here so it's called rate review
31:43 - outlined icon
31:44 - so i'm to go ahead and import that from
31:46 - material ui so
31:47 - pull that in at the top and then
31:50 - save it and we should see that in just a
31:53 - second
31:53 - and what i can do is you see right now
31:55 - this is not clickable
31:57 - right so to make a but an icon clickable
31:59 - with material ui
32:01 - all you need to do is actually pretty
32:02 - simple you go ahead and you import
32:03 - something called icon button
32:05 - yeah so i didn't auto import and then
32:08 - basically
32:09 - this takes a child so pretty much you go
32:11 - ahead and expand it i'm going to pop the
32:12 - icon inside of it
32:14 - and that will actually make this
32:16 - clickable so you see now we get that
32:17 - beautiful ripple effect
32:18 - so if you didn't know that and you now
32:21 - know that so go ahead and
32:23 - um go ahead and
32:26 - and hit the thumbs up button also thank

32:52 - today which is why we're keeping the
32:53 - speed nice and high
32:55 - okay so next thing you know we've got
32:58 - the icon button right so i'm going to
32:59 - give the icon button a class
33:01 - so i'm going to here i'm going to say
33:02 - class name of sidebar chats
33:06 - sidebar chats like this save it and then
33:09 - i'm going to go
33:10 - no no sidebar chat sorry it should be
33:12 - sidebar
33:13 - uh input button we're going to go ahead
33:16 - and use that so we can reference this
33:17 - afterwards
33:18 - and then i'm going to make also i'm
33:19 - going to give this a variant okay so i'm
33:21 - going to say this is a variant
33:23 - and i'm going to go ahead and say
33:25 - outlined also guys if you're following
33:26 - along with it right
33:28 - try not to be following line by line and
33:30 - just copying things
33:31 - try and watch it and enjoy the content
33:33 - right and oh
33:34 - snap check this out so athaba is inside
33:37 - the course we work with him and he's a
33:38 - dope student um
33:40 - and he's actually gone ahead and he
33:42 - wrote a blog with us
33:44 - it's on medium right now on the clever
33:46 - program you guys can go ahead and check
33:47 - it out
33:48 - but we just oh that's so sick man we
33:50 - just dropped an amazon 50 page plus
33:53 - blog and it's now reached 3.3 k views
33:57 - uh well done nata that was insane dude i
33:59 - really really enjoyed
34:00 - that read as well so crazy stuff man and
34:03 - and well done
34:05 - right oh i pinned it here as well uh
34:08 - let's go back
34:09 - okay so now we're gonna we have the
34:12 - sidebar chat section underneath so i'm
34:13 - gonna go ahead and first start a bit at
34:15 - the top
34:15 - thank you rag vender for the super chat
34:18 - appreciate you dude um
34:21 - so i'm going to save that and now let's
34:22 - go ahead and style this so it looks a
34:24 - little bit more like the top right so
34:25 - i'm going to go ahead pull up the
34:26 - sidebar
34:27 - oops pull up the sidebar.css split that
34:31 - page over here
34:33 - and then we've got our stuff over there
34:34 - and we don't need as much room so i'm
34:36 - going to do that
34:37 - now here what i'm going to do
34:41 - is go ahead and for the sidebar i'm
34:43 - going to say dot sidebar
34:45 - and i'm going to apply the following
34:46 - thing so i want this to take up 35
34:48 - the screens if you notice here this is
34:50 - actually taking up only 35
34:52 - the screen and the remainder is 65 the
34:55 - screen
34:56 - okay so this is taking up 35 on the
34:59 - screen
35:00 - yep and this is taking up the chat is
35:02 - taking up 65
35:03 - of the screen so in order to do that
35:05 - what we do
35:06 - is we go ahead and say
35:11 - we go ahead and we say flex 0.35
35:15 - and then we can go ahead and save it
35:17 - let's go back here
35:18 - and you're not going to notice that
35:19 - right now because we haven't actually
35:20 - applied flex to our app so let's go back
35:22 - to app.css
35:24 - go ahead and do the following we just
35:25 - need to say display flex
35:28 - right and we can close that go back here
35:32 - and then i can say height of a hundred
35:34 - view height
35:35 - that's what we want to do and i'm going
35:36 - to say it should have display flex
35:38 - the flex direction of column because
35:40 - everything inside of it we want it to go
35:42 - down
35:42 - yo what's up david david's in the house
35:45 - guys
35:46 - let david know if you're excited for
35:47 - some more man builds
35:49 - and that's gonna be insane um so let him
35:51 - know right now he's in the chat have a
35:53 - chat with david
35:54 - and uh we love you david awesome stuff
35:57 - man all right
35:58 - so then i'm going to go ahead and create
35:59 - a give it a background color so i'm
36:01 - going to go ahead and give that a little
36:02 - background color so now you can see it's
36:03 - taking up 35
36:04 - the screen and it works as we want it
36:06 - right then i'm going to give it a border
36:08 - right
36:09 - so let's go ahead and give it a border
36:10 - right one pixel solid like gray
36:12 - you see it's very subtle but it kind of
36:14 - gives a nice little design
36:16 - trait right um okay
36:19 - so next thing is the header so i'm gonna
36:22 - go ahead and pop a snippet in over here
36:24 - so we're gonna go here
36:26 - i'm gonna go and say sidebar header
36:28 - should have display flex
36:30 - align the item centrally the padding
36:32 - should be
36:33 - um the padding should be 10 pixels and a
36:36 - height of 50 pixels okay
36:38 - and then for the avatar right i want to
36:41 - have this clickable so right now it
36:42 - doesn't like it's clickable
36:44 - so i'm going to go down here and i'm
36:45 - going to first i'm going to give this a
36:46 - class name
36:48 - so i can style it in an easier way i'm
36:49 - going to say sidebar underscore
36:51 - underscore avatar
36:53 - bam naming convention in for the win and
36:55 - then i'm going to go ahead and paste it
36:57 - here
36:57 - so it says sidebar avatar cursor pointer
37:00 - margin 10 pixels now you can see
37:02 - look at that gives me a nice little like
37:04 - the cursor changes to that finger
37:06 - right so that's going to be a lot more
37:08 - of a user a nicer user experience
37:11 - okay so that's looking good now what
37:14 - we're going to do is get this
37:16 - input looking nice right so the sidebar
37:19 - input let's go ahead and do that so i'm
37:20 - going to make this a bit easier
37:22 - for you guys to see um actually so this
37:24 - is the sidebar input
37:26 - then we're styling it down here so
37:29 - i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to
37:30 - say sidebar underscore underscore
37:32 - input and i'm going to say oops
37:36 - i'm going to say display flex boom and
37:39 - then you can see everything gets pulled
37:40 - in centrally i'm going to say align item
37:42 - center
37:43 - and then we'll say justify content
37:44 - center as well because i want my
37:46 - everything to kind of be centered
37:48 - equally as it gets bigger when i say
37:50 - flex one i want this to take up the most
37:52 - room
37:52 - in that container you might not tell now
37:54 - but if i make this bigger
37:56 - i mean it's limited to 35 but you always
37:59 - want to
37:59 - have it being responsive if something
38:01 - changes background color let's go ahead
38:03 - and give it a background color
38:04 - save that and you can see we're starting
38:06 - to get this little
38:08 - background color over here hadi says
38:10 - hello sunny what's up dude
38:11 - good to see you here and then we're
38:13 - going to go ahead and change the color
38:14 - of the text to gray so i'm going to go
38:16 - ahead and say color gray and
38:18 - then i'm going to say border radius of 5
38:20 - pixels
38:21 - all right you're probably wondering this
38:22 - don't look nothing like this
38:24 - right so how do we get it to finishing
38:27 - stage right now
38:28 - we're going to go ahead and target the
38:29 - inner input because right now we're
38:31 - targeting the div
38:32 - so here i'm going to say sidebar input
38:34 - and then target the inner input
38:37 - and we're going to go ahead and say
38:38 - border of none
38:40 - save it okay it's looking a little bit
38:42 - better
38:43 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
38:45 - background transparent
38:47 - okay okay that's looking clean
38:51 - and then the final thing is you see when
38:52 - i click it we don't we get this horrible
38:54 - blue outline
38:55 - so to get rid of that we go here and we
38:56 - say outline width and make it a zero
38:59 - save it and now boom we don't get the
39:02 - outline width
39:03 - all right so it's a neat little trick
39:04 - for you guys so we can go ahead and save
39:07 - it
39:08 - and then uh i'm gonna go ahead and check
39:11 - also the input button right so the input
39:15 - button
39:16 - everything's good now yeah so awesome
39:19 - so with that said now we're gonna go to
39:21 - the sidebar chats
39:22 - right so the sidebar chats so this
39:25 - section right here
39:26 - now in this section is where we have
39:28 - everything
39:29 - looking like this right so we have all
39:31 - these sort of sidebar chats individually

39:53 - you can pretty much go ahead and use
39:55 - firebase or you can use the man stack to

43:27 - really really amazing um there's also
43:31 - another one i saw
43:32 - uh i can't find it now but somebody else
43:34 - had another success story so
43:36 - live code says how many years of
43:37 - experience do you have with the react
43:39 - um at this point i'd say maybe
43:43 - maybe four three three or four four
43:46 - years maybe
43:47 - four years yeah potentially but doesn't
43:49 - matter once you even if you have one
43:51 - month
43:51 - you can make money with that right so
43:54 - you just need to
43:55 - keep the positive energy uh you don't
43:57 - need a huge amount of experience you
43:59 - just need to stop
44:00 - right next thing we're gonna do is
44:02 - create sidebar so i'm gonna say sidebar
44:05 - chat underscore underscore info
44:09 - right and inside of here we're gonna
44:10 - have a h3 with a channel name so it's
44:12 - gonna say channel name
44:13 - and this will obviously be like one of
44:15 - these like yo testing test while youtube
44:17 - and so forth and then i'm gonna have a p
44:20 - tag
44:21 - this is going to have the last message
44:22 - that was sent so imagine if i'm inside
44:24 - of this
44:25 - and we say abc you see it says abc
44:28 - because it's the last message that was
44:29 - sent
44:30 - so i'm going to say last message sent
44:33 - dot dot
44:34 - keep the suspense you know and then i'm
44:37 - going to go ahead and add a
44:38 - small tag so it's just a small piece of
44:40 - text and this is going to be a time
44:42 - stamp
44:43 - right so again it's going to be like a
44:45 - little timestamp in the corner
44:46 - i'm just going to add it in for now like
44:48 - this all right with that said
44:50 - we're going to go and style this to make
44:53 - it look
44:53 - a little bit more like this right now
44:55 - okay um
44:57 - thank you so much uh rosh kneebarad says
44:59 - love all your videos keep you up
45:01 - keep up the support dude really
45:02 - appreciate you um
45:05 - what happens after you log in refresh
45:07 - off the login jonathan jonathan jonathan
45:09 - check this out dude so i'm logged in
45:11 - right now
45:11 - for refresh boom logs me in
45:15 - we have persistence with redox and
45:17 - google authentication so
45:19 - it's uh it's really powerful okay
45:22 - um going back to the react redux
45:26 - so here what we're gonna do is we're
45:29 - gonna open up our sidebar chat
45:32 - dot css sidebar chat
45:35 - and then here i'm gonna start coding
45:38 - these styles first thing i wanna do is
45:40 - say dot sidebar
45:43 - chat and then open parentheses display
45:46 - flex and then i'm going to say align
45:49 - item centrally
45:50 - and then save it and you can see
45:51 - everything goes into a line right then
45:53 - i'm going to say padding
45:54 - i'm going to say 20 pixels because i
45:57 - want to give it a bit more spacing
45:58 - around it
45:59 - i'm gonna give it a border bottom of one
46:01 - pixel light gray solid
46:03 - do that boom gives that a nice thing and
46:05 - then i also want it to have a cursor
46:07 - when i hover over it
46:08 - right because we want that sort of nice
46:10 - uh user experience so cursor pointer
46:13 - and then there we go so somebody says
46:16 - how is this build different from
46:17 - whatsapp clone apart from the ui
46:19 - so firstly the whatsapp film wasn't
46:20 - built with redux whatsapp chrome was
46:22 - built with the react context api
46:24 - um so no it's going to be a little bit
46:26 - different to that
46:28 - secondly we have a few other elements so
46:31 - the build is slightly different to the
46:32 - whatsapp clone
46:33 - but yeah the main thing here is redux is
46:35 - powering it all so redux is the thing
46:37 - that's going to land you the job as as
46:39 - opposed to
46:40 - um as opposed to somebody who who won't
46:43 - get the job redux something which you're
46:45 - gonna need
46:45 - when you're applying for professional
46:47 - jobs and i really recommend you learn it
46:49 - right now
46:50 - so starting with this clone uh preshoon
46:53 - thank you so much dude he says donated
46:55 - 20 uh
46:56 - real things rupees in your imessage
46:58 - clone you guys are taking such great
46:59 - efforts to make these brilliant
47:00 - tutorials
47:01 - this is just a small token of
47:02 - appreciation dude for an 11 year old
47:04 - thank you
47:05 - so much man that is really really
47:07 - awesome
47:08 - thank you going back
47:11 - i'm going to make a hover effect i'm
47:13 - going to say when we hover over it
47:15 - i'm going to change the background color
47:16 - to blue and the color of the text to
47:18 - white
47:19 - let's go ahead and do that save it and
47:20 - now you can see we get this
47:23 - you see we're building this pretty fast
47:24 - man so now if i go ahead and hover over
47:27 - it
47:27 - looks really good okay we're almost at
47:30 - 500 likes as well guys
47:32 - at 402 so let's keep pushing that like
47:35 - count get this video out to as many
47:37 - people as possible oh nice many says
47:40 - maybe a suggestion for next video is to
47:42 - start components 100 style components
47:45 - react native ragna is something fun
47:48 - coming
47:49 - right next thing we're going to do is
47:51 - start the info section
47:52 - so here i'm going to go ahead and say
47:55 - sidebar info go ahead and hide the sign
47:58 - and then i'm going to go ahead and do a
48:00 - margin left
48:01 - because right now it's touching the
48:03 - avatar right here i don't want that i'm
48:05 - going to say margin
48:07 - left of 15 pixels
48:10 - okay save it it pushes it slightly away
48:13 - that's nice and then i'm going to go
48:14 - ahead and do position relative
48:16 - because i want that time stamp inside
48:18 - afterwards to be on the top right
48:20 - i'm also going to say width of 100
48:24 - okay now next thing i'm going to do is
48:26 - i'm going to target the small tag that
48:28 - we added in inside of this i'm going to
48:29 - say
48:30 - go inside the container the info
48:32 - container and the small tag
48:34 - and i'm going to say make it position
48:35 - absolute but because we made the parent
48:37 - relative it's actually not going to
48:39 - behave in a crazy way
48:41 - right if i do this and i say top 5
48:43 - pixels away from the top
48:45 - now you can see it sticks to the top if
48:47 - i say go to the right of zero
48:49 - and now you see the time stamps over
48:51 - there right
48:52 - so this is how we do these kind of
48:54 - things right and we get those little
48:56 - things
48:57 - uh in place so as a young person can i
48:59 - still make money programming
49:00 - dude 100 billion percent we have people
49:03 - inside of profit with javascript
49:04 - right now right let me let me just send
49:07 - the message out right now
49:08 - if you're young if you're old it doesn't
49:10 - matter what the case right whatever age
49:12 - you are
49:13 - yeah as if you're here right now so
49:15 - you're starting off that coding journey
49:16 - okay
49:17 - now it just followed up with another one
49:18 - so he's 11 years old
49:20 - and he says what do i need to to know to
49:22 - start coding
49:23 - to start learning react whoa dude
49:26 - damn that's a big donation that's uh i'm
49:29 - i'm not sure how much that is dude
49:31 - uh but thank you so much and i'll answer
49:33 - the other question afterwards but
49:34 - william wong says
49:36 - you are giving me clean and clear
49:38 - understanding from modern javascript
49:40 - development
49:40 - without tons of reading docs so thank
49:42 - you very much and the pwj community
49:44 - william wong thank you dude and we love
49:47 - the energy that people like you bring
49:49 - into the community so
49:50 - amazing amazing stuff really really
49:53 - appreciate that big donation dude
49:55 - now back to the question as to if you're
49:57 - young and you're in a code
49:58 - what i would say is look you're here
50:00 - right now you're in the right place
50:01 - right
50:02 - what i also want you to do right now and
50:03 - this is everyone watching right now
50:05 - go into the description sign up to the
50:07 - free training right the tree free
50:09 - webinar training the reason being
50:12 - because that is a
50:13 - free training guys and that's going to
50:15 - allow you to go ahead and get
50:16 - you know more free value so if you
50:18 - haven't already signed up to that make
50:20 - sure you go ahead and do it let me know
50:21 - in the comments after you've done that
50:23 - right and then go ahead and check it out
50:26 - um also somebody says hey sonny what do
50:29 - you think would be a great way
50:30 - to not lose touch with an old
50:32 - programming language you've learned for
50:34 - example you're learning javascript and
50:35 - you're forgetting python
50:36 - okay very good question but i'll quickly
50:38 - answer this one then we'll carry on with
50:39 - the build
50:39 - right what i would say to this question
50:41 - is you're never actually going to go
50:43 - ahead and learn
50:44 - you're never going to go ahead and
50:45 - forget sorry the languages before so
50:48 - for example i've coded in python plenty
50:49 - of times before but i haven't coded it
50:51 - in ages
50:52 - doesn't mean i forgot python but if you
50:54 - understand
50:55 - programming principles well for example
50:58 - data types
50:58 - like what is an array how what is a four
51:01 - loop what is a loop uh
51:02 - you know it was a four sorry um like
51:05 - was it if condition sorry and a for loop
51:07 - and things like that then as long as you
51:09 - know that
51:10 - right then those things are transferable
51:12 - doesn't matter what language you're
51:14 - coding in right they're just pretty much
51:15 - you can go ahead and hop between them
51:16 - and it really doesn't matter so if i
51:18 - need to code in python tomorrow
51:20 - you can pretty much use all the skills i
51:21 - have from today and pretty much go ahead
51:23 - and pick up python really quick so
51:25 - that's why
51:25 - i'm gonna go ahead and mess out with
51:27 - mess around with uh react native again
51:29 - react native is javascript so it's gonna
51:31 - be very easy to transition over to but
51:32 - also things like flutter
51:34 - flutter is something which i would
51:35 - recommend going and checking out gabriel
51:37 - graves says
51:38 - that big donation by william wong was
51:40 - 19.35 dude amazing thank you so much
51:44 - um and appreciate taruna coogan says
51:46 - thank you so much bro
51:47 - thank you dude for watching um yeah i
51:50 - love the energy today guys
51:51 - really really positive stuff right
51:55 - so this is looking good right so we can
51:57 - pretty much all of these avatars we can
51:59 - go ahead and
52:00 - customize it with a picture in a bit
52:03 - for now what i'm going to do is go back
52:05 - to this
52:06 - sidebar.js i'm going to go ahead and
52:09 - copy it and basically just paste it out
52:10 - to test it so imagine we had a bunch of
52:12 - channels
52:13 - there you go we can pretty much this is
52:14 - starting to look a lot like our build
52:16 - right
52:16 - now if i was to go ahead and spam this
52:21 - thing
52:22 - so that it goes a bit longer you see it
52:23 - we kind of broke the page
52:26 - right the page isn't really working in
52:27 - the way we expect it to
52:29 - so to fix this what we're going to do is
52:31 - we're going to go over to our sidebar.js
52:34 - sidebar.css sorry and what i'm going to
52:37 - do is target sidebar chats
52:39 - so sidebar.css i'm going to pull this
52:42 - underneath
52:43 - i'm going to target sidebar chats and
52:46 - inside of sidebar chats what i'm going
52:48 - to say is i'm going to say overflow
52:50 - scroll right so as soon as i do that now
52:53 - now it has a scrolling functionality
52:55 - right so that's a lot more cleaner
52:57 - and would be uh really really like much
53:01 - more of a nice user experience doesn't
53:02 - look broken anymore right
53:04 - um so and also i don't want this
53:07 - horrible scroll bar but i want to keep
53:08 - the scrolling functionality
53:10 - right uh right so sun kit dev says i've
53:14 - watched signed up for the webinars and
53:15 - one and it's important i'm now confused
53:16 - with to watch this or the webinar
53:18 - so honestly for the webinar we we show
53:20 - that quite a few times so don't worry
53:22 - watch this
53:23 - for now and then you can watch the
53:25 - webinar afterwards um so
53:26 - yeah that's a good way of doing it um
53:30 - a lot of people said can we expect react
53:33 - me it builds later on 100 dude
53:35 - react native is coming later on um
53:39 - somebody says do you need to learn
53:40 - vanilla javascript before learning react
53:42 - i would recommend learning the basics
53:44 - we do teach the basics inside a profit
53:46 - with javascript if you're interested in
53:47 - joining cleverprogrammer.com forward
53:49 - slash pwj
53:52 - right um okay so overflow scrub so
53:56 - there's a little trick that i want to
53:57 - show you guys and what you can do is
53:58 - this there's a snippet of code i'm gonna
54:00 - pop in here
54:01 - and this right here the top one hides
54:03 - the scroll bar for chrome safari and
54:05 - oprah
54:06 - the bottom one holds it for internet
54:07 - explorer edge and firefox once we don't
54:09 - really care about
54:10 - and let's start war with that but
54:13 - then what we're going to do is save it
54:15 - and you can see now we get all that
54:16 - space back
54:17 - right so that's a lot cleaner um but you
54:20 - still have that scrolling functionality
54:21 - right so that's a lot nicer way of doing
54:23 - it we're going to use props to basically
54:25 - customize these so that way they can
54:26 - have different values but that's a step
54:29 - for afterwards um for now what i'm going
54:32 - to do is i'm just going to go ahead and
54:34 - just
54:34 - uh just have like three so we don't
54:36 - overly overload this but right now there
54:38 - you go
54:39 - we've done the sidebar right so the
54:42 - sidebar is now done
54:43 - amazing stuff we're at 432 likes uh
54:46 - we're moving through this build pretty
54:48 - fast
54:48 - uh somebody says react hooks are
54:50 - confusing can you please explain it
54:51 - better
54:52 - i will explain it when we get to that
54:54 - point and yeah for sure dude
54:56 - so now we're going to create the chat
54:59 - component so this part right here on the
55:01 - on the right hand side so for the chat
55:03 - what we're going to do
55:04 - i'm going to go into imessage.js where
55:06 - we have the build going to get rid of my
55:08 - comment over here
55:09 - and i'm going to create the chat
55:11 - component
55:13 - so if i save it it goes ahead and it
55:15 - freaks out because we don't have chat so
55:17 - i'm going to go ahead and say chat.js
55:19 - do my neat little rfce trick
55:22 - go back and i'm gonna go to the top and
55:24 - say import
55:26 - uh chat.css
55:30 - go there create another file oh god
55:32 - create another file oh no no no
55:34 - no no don't do that go to source
55:37 - go back down here create another chat
55:40 - dot css
55:41 - there we go make sure you don't make a
55:43 - mistake like that okay um
55:45 - will all these videos be free on youtube
55:47 - forever
55:48 - yes dude they're going to be free
55:50 - forever right all of these videos are
55:52 - going to stay up on youtube free for you
55:54 - guys they're just pretty much to drop
55:55 - value for you guys so if you like that
55:58 - smash the thumbs up button that's it
56:00 - that's all we ask all right and that
56:02 - will help
56:03 - these three videos get out to as many
56:04 - people as possible so it can help
56:06 - our mission of 5 000 developers right
56:10 - um i appreciate you anupam uh so
56:13 - it says cersei really appreciate your
56:14 - work and god bless tmcp
56:16 - thank you dude so i'm going to go ahead
56:18 - and remove this comment and
56:21 - save it and then i'm going to import the
56:23 - chat component
56:24 - boom go to chat.js and here i'm going to
56:27 - go ahead and say class name
56:29 - uh chat okay now inside of here
56:33 - what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go
56:35 - ahead and
56:36 - where we have this right here um
56:40 - i'm gonna go ahead and do the following
56:43 - so
56:44 - we have inside of the chat we have the
56:47 - header
56:48 - right so the first thing we do is we
56:50 - have this header so the chat
56:52 - header and then we have the chat sort of
56:55 - body or the chat messages
56:57 - so this section right here and then we
56:58 - have the chat input it says three
57:00 - sections here
57:01 - okay so i'm gonna go ahead and you know
57:05 - how we do it we like to draft things
57:06 - out so i'm gonna go ahead and first do
57:09 - this i'm gonna say
57:09 - chat header then we have the chat
57:14 - messages and then we have
57:18 - the chat input okay
57:21 - uh awesome stuff thank you so much
57:23 - nathan for the positivity let's keep
57:25 - that energy higher we're holding on to
57:27 - 300 viewers this is insane
57:29 - uh victoria code says hi sonny you're
57:31 - one hell of an amazing teacher thanks
57:33 - for giving us such valuable content
57:35 - appreciate your victoria code and really
57:38 - nice to see you here thank you so much
57:40 - for the kind words so the top part chat
57:43 - header we're going to go ahead and use
57:44 - emmett so we're going to say chat
57:45 - underscore underscore header boom naming
57:47 - convention for the win
57:48 - and then you can see it pops up and then
57:50 - we're going to have a h4 inside
57:51 - and this is going to be responsible for
57:53 - this part right here
57:55 - how is the music making me making you
57:56 - tired dude this music should be
57:58 - awakening you
57:59 - up all right i mean if i if i up here
58:01 - right now that i think that i think i'll
58:04 - wake some people up you know but
58:07 - then we're gonna go ahead and do h4 and
58:10 - here i'm gonna say
58:11 - two and this would actually be the name
58:14 - of the room you're in so for example
58:15 - friends i have the youtube name it'll
58:17 - say to youtube but here i'm gonna say
58:19 - two
58:20 - and we're just gonna say channel name
58:21 - for now okay so these are all kind of
58:24 - placeholders for now
58:25 - all right um then i'm going to go
58:29 - ahead and render this on imessage so
58:32 - save it where is it oh yes you see right
58:35 - now it's underneath here
58:36 - so you guys can actually see us but it's
58:38 - actually popped underneath the reason
58:39 - why that's happened
58:41 - is because if we go to imessage we need
58:43 - to go ahead and go into our imessage.css
58:46 - and i need to do the following and say
58:47 - imessage display flex save it
58:50 - and boom that happens because it's flex
58:53 - so it's flex row
58:55 - um oh man oh man mohammed says sonny i
58:58 - can meet you in london i'm from
58:59 - tottenham hey
59:00 - let's go united kingdom crew muhammad
59:03 - shazad says hi sunny you're an amazing
59:05 - dude master and react appreciate the
59:06 - kind words thank you so much
59:08 - um so this is actually the music that
59:12 - i'm listening to right now is actually
59:13 - part of
59:14 - um i can't remember the
59:17 - comment for the service we use uh i will
59:19 - find that out though but i think it's
59:20 - it's basically the youtube copyright
59:22 - free music and that's the one that we
59:24 - use and i found a nice little
59:25 - rhythm that kind of goes with it um
59:28 - thank you so much adi meinstein goes hi
59:30 - it's my first time watching your stream
59:31 - in a while love brother keep smashing
59:33 - them thank you so much dude appreciate
59:34 - the positivity and guys we're almost at
59:37 - 500 likes
59:39 - this is insane let's keep going all
59:41 - right so imessage
59:43 - let's go ahead um
59:48 - oh dude this is for you amazing so i've
59:50 - been into reacting redox and often it
59:52 - seems like setting up redux to work is
59:53 - pretty annoying
59:54 - yes redux is annoying to set up go ahead
59:56 - and rewind this
59:57 - once this is finished i show you how to
59:59 - use create reactor with the redux
60:00 - template
60:01 - makes it so easy honestly it makes it so
60:03 - so easy
60:05 - um right so now we've got the channel
60:08 - name right here so i'm going to go back
60:09 - into
60:10 - the chat and then we're going to carry
60:11 - on so here we're also going to have a
60:13 - strong tag
60:15 - so strong tag the team are having a team
60:18 - meeting on a team lunch on
60:21 - zoom i feel left out right now damn it
60:24 - so we got details and then we can see
60:26 - here so two channel names
60:28 - details and then inside of here we're
60:30 - gonna go ahead and start this right now
60:32 - so i'm gonna get rid of this comment
60:34 - and i'm gonna also so where it says the
60:37 - channel name i'm gonna span
60:39 - a style here because i wanna style this
60:41 - up so i'm going to say span
60:43 - and i'm going to move channel name the
60:45 - contents of this
60:47 - to here and then i'm going to give this
60:49 - a class name
60:50 - so that i i love this comment dude
60:54 - sunkit dalvi says sunny is a treasure
60:56 - that we all must protect
60:58 - that's amazing thank you so much dude
61:01 - appreciate you
61:02 - uh so funny um
61:06 - all right nice
61:10 - um so now what we're going to do is
61:11 - we're going to go ahead and give this a
61:15 - chat underscore underscore name because
61:18 - it would be like the chat name channel
61:20 - name
61:20 - right so that looks good
61:24 - and i guess the next step naturally
61:27 - is to go ahead and start the top part so
61:30 - chat
61:31 - i've got a new mouse i'm getting used to
61:33 - it right and then we've got this i'm
61:35 - going to say
61:36 - for the chat what i want is i want to
61:39 - have display flex
61:42 - all right display flex direction is
61:44 - going to be column
61:45 - save it and flex
61:48 - is going to be 0.65 now why is it 0.65
61:51 - because remember
61:52 - this is 0.35 this is 0.65
61:56 - right because we want to take up the
61:57 - remainder of the room
62:00 - i'm going to say a height of 100 view
62:02 - height and i'm going to say background
62:03 - color of white
62:06 - all right save it boom right trust me
62:09 - it'll make sense in a bit why
62:10 - i set it to white now for the chat
62:12 - header what i'm going to do is i'm going
62:14 - to
62:14 - copy this paste and copy and paste this
62:17 - snippet in right here
62:18 - okay so saving this and you can see now
62:21 - it says having a 20 pixels display flex
62:23 - justify content space between
62:26 - bottom border and a background color
62:28 - right
62:29 - now let's debug it because something's
62:32 - gone
62:32 - wrong here so i don't actually know what
62:36 - went wrong here but you see we haven't
62:37 - actually got
62:39 - this right here yeah we haven't actually
62:41 - got this this
62:42 - like this should be filling out the the
62:44 - bit over here so
62:45 - something went wrong right so we're
62:47 - going to debug this
62:49 - scan to the debugging sort of mood right
62:51 - so i like to get a bit serious when we
62:53 - debug
62:54 - so now we're going to go ahead and find
62:57 - out why
62:58 - this why isn't this stretching all the
63:01 - way over here
63:02 - so i'm going to go ahead and find out
63:03 - why okay
63:05 - so it gets tense guys right because i'm
63:08 - not actually sure
63:09 - why that's not stretching over there so
63:10 - i'm going to refresh to make sure that
63:12 - i've
63:12 - exhausted everything okay and then what
63:15 - we're going to do is chat header
63:17 - right now should go ahead and let's see
63:23 - so the header right now it should be
63:26 - flex okay 0.65 save it oops no i don't
63:30 - want that what did i change
63:32 - all right so chat sits
63:36 - inside of imessage right imessage has
63:40 - sidebar and chat inside of it
63:41 - so let's open up our sidebar
63:45 - dot css and then here we've got 0.35
63:49 - right so display flex
63:52 - display flex okay
63:57 - what we could do is we could say at this
63:59 - point we could say width i don't really
64:00 - want to do width of 100
64:03 - i don't really like to do that approach
64:06 - right but
64:15 - why is that happening so we've got flex
64:17 - 0.65
64:18 - right it's even more stressful when
64:20 - you're live imagine how i feel guys
64:22 - i'm live and something don't work right
64:24 - i'm going to inspect it now so i'm going
64:26 - to show you guys how i do this
64:28 - so i'm going to go ahead pull this out
64:29 - because what we want
64:31 - is this where it takes up the entire
64:33 - space
64:34 - right and i'm not sure why it's not so
64:39 - maybe parent should be some people are
64:43 - saying should be 100 but you see the
64:44 - chat
64:45 - so this is actually flex 0.35 this is
64:49 - flex 0.65 the parent is display flex
64:55 - right but then the width of imessage ah
64:59 - no no width of imessage width of app.css
65:05 - oh
65:05 - i see why i see why all right
65:08 - so notice how app we've done display
65:10 - flex
65:12 - ah there it is all right i'm gonna move
65:16 - myself by the way
65:17 - app there it is guys that is why
65:21 - so we found the issue so you see that i
65:24 - didn't need display flex on the app
65:26 - it was because i then nested it inside
65:28 - of imessage where we had display flex so
65:30 - this was stopping me from using all of
65:31 - the space so we did it guys we fixed the
65:34 - bug
65:34 - hey go ahead and hit the thumbs up
65:37 - button if that was some fun
65:38 - i thought that was pretty cool honestly
65:39 - that was actually something unplanned
65:41 - for i didn't realize that was gonna
65:42 - happen but
65:43 - we did it so let's carry on right uh
65:46 - i'm gonna go ahead and fix that now so
65:50 - go back to our code go back to app.css
65:53 - i'm going to get rid of this we don't
65:55 - need this one right
65:56 - boom oh somebody said the air horn dude
65:59 - you're right man i haven't
66:00 - done the air horn in a while let's go
66:06 - why is that so quiet all right let me go
66:08 - ahead and let me let me do it one more
66:09 - time right
66:10 - three two one and
66:15 - that that that blew my head off but
66:18 - we're back all right uh carrying on
66:22 - right so honestly that was actually
66:26 - something pretty cool because that's not
66:28 - like a real life example of where i ran
66:30 - into a debugging issue and we kind of
66:32 - went through it and solved it together
66:33 - so
66:34 - hope you guys enjoyed that we're 15
66:36 - likes away from 500 uh
66:37 - 500 likes so smash the thumbs up button
66:39 - if you enjoyed that live debugging
66:41 - session
66:42 - a bit of fun as well with the music okay
66:44 - now
66:46 - back into coding right so now
66:49 - we have that done i'm going to go ahead
66:51 - and hide this
66:54 - him and she said yo that horn sound i
66:57 - know dude that woke me up
66:58 - so yeah i want my neighbors up right um
67:01 - so we've got that looking pretty good
67:03 - right now we're going to carry on
67:04 - styling it out so here i'm going to say
67:07 - we're inside of chat.css so right now
67:10 - i'm going to go ahead and start the chat
67:12 - header so i'm going to say chat header
67:15 - i'm going to target the h4 element
67:17 - inside so if we go into my chat you'll
67:18 - see i've got the h4 here
67:20 - so i'm going to go ahead and target the
67:21 - h4 and i'm going to say font weight of
67:23 - 500 so we want to reduce the weight
67:25 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
67:27 - color of gray
67:29 - boom right and then
67:33 - you can see it change the color a bit
67:34 - right but we spanned in this chat name
67:36 - right so chat name we're actually gonna
67:39 - go ahead and add a bit of styling to
67:41 - ourselves
67:41 - and we're gonna make this one um so if i
67:44 - go here and i say chat name
67:46 - and i say color black
67:47 - [Music]
67:49 - and now you should see the channel name
67:51 - is actually black right
67:53 - um you and the rest of the team are the
67:56 - best also what i need to know
67:58 - to start react just start dude honestly
68:00 - just start like learn the basics on the
68:02 - fly you can go ahead and do that
68:04 - um so yeah just go ahead and start um
68:08 - okay
68:10 - oh somebody says why do you use pixels
68:12 - versus ram
68:13 - very good question actually we'll touch
68:15 - on a different video but we should
68:17 - rem is a good unit to use actually but
68:19 - we're going to go ahead and do that
68:20 - another video okay so now we're going to
68:23 - go and build the
68:25 - um we're going to build the chat
68:28 - messages
68:29 - section right so i'm going to ign i'm
68:31 - actually going to leave this bit right
68:32 - here the middle section so where we
68:34 - actually have the messages i'm going to
68:35 - leave that to after
68:37 - but right now i'm going to build the
68:38 - input section at the bottom okay
68:40 - so i'm going to move myself a little bit
68:42 - and we're going to have the input
68:44 - section
68:45 - uh yeah this is a good point stop
68:47 - repeating and i'm
68:48 - i'm literally going to ignore you i can
68:50 - see when people constantly keep copying
68:51 - and pasting stuff right
68:53 - now i can see somebody spamming the chat
68:55 - you're getting blocked dude
68:56 - like don't do that stuff right
69:00 - uh yeah you're blocked so yeah sorry
69:03 - about that but
69:04 - you know you're asking for it when you
69:06 - when you play around like that so
69:07 - don't go ahead and do that because we
69:10 - want everyone to
69:11 - have you know we want everyone to to
69:14 - sort of be
69:15 - to get value from this uh as opposed to
69:18 - you know just messing around also
69:20 - elizabeth you just earned moderator
69:22 - rights
69:22 - so feel free to block people um
69:25 - right so now we're gonna go ahead and
69:27 - for the chat input
69:29 - i'm gonna first do chat input and then
69:31 - i'm gonna say div
69:32 - chat underscore underscore um
69:36 - [Music]
69:37 - input right and then here i'm going to
69:40 - have a form
69:42 - because we like to have the submit
69:43 - functionality where you basically hit
69:45 - the enter key
69:46 - inside the input field i'm going to have
69:47 - an input field and i'm going to have a
69:49 - button
69:50 - which says send message now i will be
69:52 - hiding this button but for now it
69:54 - doesn't matter
69:55 - okay and the goal is we're going to try
69:56 - and change this to look like this thing
69:58 - down here
69:59 - all right so it's going to eventually
70:00 - look like this very nice uh
70:02 - user input form at the bottom so this
70:04 - imessage
70:05 - where it says this bottom thing right
70:07 - here we're gonna have that looking very
70:08 - nice at the end
70:11 - so
70:14 - so somebody says why is it free and we
70:16 - have paid for pwj
70:18 - so this is actually a this is a coach
70:19 - this is not a coaching call guys and
70:21 - also
70:22 - um pwj has a ton more than what we offer
70:25 - on youtube so if you think youtube is
70:27 - good
70:28 - we have all the modules inside the
70:30 - profile of javascript we have coaching
70:31 - calls we have one-to-one access we have
70:32 - a community of amazing people inside
70:35 - there
70:35 - everything that is available inside the
70:37 - course in profit javascript is not
70:39 - available here
70:40 - right so uh yeah right so
70:44 - now what we're gonna do is have um
70:48 - we're gonna change the input placeholder
70:51 - to say imessage
70:54 - save it and now you should see it say
70:56 - imessage inside
70:57 - the button we're going to go ahead and
70:59 - fire off a function
71:01 - called send message because the whole
71:03 - point is that when we click that
71:05 - it should send a message okay so we
71:07 - haven't written this function yet so i'm
71:08 - going to write that in a sec
71:11 - so i'm going to go up here and i'm going
71:12 - to say const
71:14 - send message takes an event
71:19 - and it fires off an arrow function then
71:20 - we're going to do e dot prevent default
71:22 - because if i don't do this right i'll
71:23 - show you what happens
71:24 - so if i type in hit enter see it refresh
71:26 - so watch this bit at the top
71:29 - boom boom boom enter and it just
71:31 - disappears right
71:32 - so that's going to be like we don't want
71:35 - to do that right we don't want to have
71:36 - that
71:37 - hey logan's in the house what's up logan
71:39 - good to see you dude
71:41 - uh logan's absolutely killing it and he
71:43 - we work with him daily so
71:46 - good awesome guy he's inside a prophet
71:47 - javascript as well
71:49 - um right so
71:52 - we're actually gonna go ahead and create
71:53 - the send message but we don't want that
71:55 - refresh right
71:56 - we're going to do e dot prevent default
72:00 - thank you so much lloyd for the kind
72:01 - words prevent default oh god whatever
72:03 - we're done here prevent
72:04 - default like this go back save it
72:08 - and then down here basically this is
72:10 - where we do all the sort of firebase
72:11 - magic so this is going to be firebase
72:12 - magic
72:13 - in a bit and yeah now
72:17 - we want to kind of keep track of when
72:19 - i'm typing in
72:20 - right so as i'm typing in here i want to
72:22 - keep track of what's got what's
72:24 - sort of like i'm going to keep track of
72:26 - this input inside of state
72:28 - so in order to do that what i'm going to
72:30 - do
72:31 - is um i'm going to go ahead and do
72:34 - the following so i'm going to go ahead
72:35 - and say const i'm going to use
72:37 - a this the use state hooks i'm going to
72:40 - introduce a piece of state
72:41 - and thank you ankit he goes hey you are
72:44 - doing a great job man thank you thank
72:45 - you appreciate that dude
72:47 - um i'm going to create a piece of state
72:49 - called input and i'm going to say
72:50 - set input and um
72:53 - guys don't please please please don't
72:56 - i'm going to just
72:58 - you're getting blocked you're getting
72:59 - blocked like it really annoys me when i
73:01 - see stuff like that right
73:02 - um go ahead and now we're going to go
73:05 - and do this input set input
73:09 - and i'm going to equals use state right
73:12 - i'm going to import it from react while
73:14 - right so you see we import it at the top
73:16 - and and this is going to initially be
73:19 - an empty string right now to map it to
73:22 - the input field i'm going to say value
73:24 - equals input and then i'm going to say
73:28 - on change equals
73:31 - e set input
73:34 - and it's going to be e dot target dot
73:36 - value
73:38 - right um
73:42 - font size really needs to increase okay
73:44 - so we can make it a bit bigger
73:46 - i mean guys yeah i mean i like i do make
73:48 - it this way but like when we're doing
73:50 - huge builds i don't like it to be
73:51 - so in your face but that's pretty good i
73:53 - think okay
73:58 - um okay
74:01 - next we're gonna go ahead and have
74:05 - also guys bear in mind like imagine
74:06 - you're doing a build and then you're
74:08 - doing like
74:09 - the checking the comments and you're
74:10 - doing all this other stuff it's a lot to
74:12 - take in you know it's a lot to process
74:13 - and do that
74:14 - um lloyd says sunny man dude you
74:17 - just give the but you're just you just
74:19 - give the best of the react appreciate it
74:20 - man
74:21 - appreciate you watching lloyd thank you
74:22 - so much um logan says i got my second pc
74:25 - and up and running with sen os7 running
74:27 - ssh is up on boots so i can remote into
74:29 - it with vs code on windows ah
74:31 - that's jacked man nice because uh
74:34 - kind of awesome i have real linux in my
74:37 - vs code camera that's dope man
74:38 - i like that that's awesome stuff dude
74:43 - all right so what we're going to do next
74:47 - is
74:47 - i'm going to have the send message over
74:49 - here so
74:51 - once with that i'm going to go ahead and
74:54 - say
74:58 - i want to basically after i send the
74:59 - message i'm going to set the input to be
75:01 - an empty string so
75:03 - now if we see if i go ahead and type
75:05 - something in hit enter
75:06 - see it it actually clears out the
75:08 - contents right so that's a good thing
75:10 - so what i'm going to do now
75:14 - is actually go ahead and have this this
75:17 - halfway i'm going to style this input
75:19 - field so it looks like the
75:20 - beautiful finished input field down here
75:22 - that we see at the bottom okay
75:24 - so in order to do that i'm going to go
75:26 - ahead and also
75:27 - please stop asking the same question
75:29 - something any particular reason for
75:30 - using search icon rather than search
75:32 - no dude uh it was just a case of it was
75:35 - the one that i got i found and it worked
75:37 - for me
75:37 - okay so here i'm going to go ahead
75:40 - and do chat dots here also guys don't
75:43 - focus on that stuff like you should be
75:45 - looking at the build
75:46 - not that stuff like honestly if you're
75:48 - focusing on what my import was as
75:50 - opposed to like what the actual
75:51 - functionality is i'm doing
75:53 - you like you know pay attention to the
75:55 - right areas right that's what you need
75:57 - to kind of pay attention to correct
75:58 - areas
76:00 - so i'm going to open up my chat.css
76:03 - and here i'm going to go ahead and say
76:04 - dot chat input
76:07 - right and i'm going to say display flex
76:11 - and i'm going to go ahead and say align
76:13 - item center
76:16 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
76:17 - padding 10 pixels oh god
76:20 - padding 10 pixels 20 pixels which means
76:24 - 10 pixels left and right uh 20 px
76:26 - 10 pixels top and bottom um and 20
76:29 - pixels left and right okay
76:30 - then i'm going to say border top one
76:31 - pixel solid light gray boom
76:34 - save that and i'm going to say
76:36 - background color white
76:39 - nice oh no gray sorry i want to be gray
76:42 - okay
76:43 - then what i'm going to say is i'm going
76:44 - to target the form and i'm going to give
76:46 - it a
76:46 - flex of one right because i want the
76:49 - form to take up the most input at the
76:51 - most space
76:52 - i'm going to say flex one and that will
76:54 - actually go ahead and it'll push it
76:56 - as far as it can be pushed and what we
76:58 - need to then do is say
76:59 - target the form and then the input
77:03 - inside the form
77:04 - get a width of 98 outline width of zero
77:08 - border one pixel light green
77:11 - border radius 999 so it gives it a
77:13 - rounded effect and padding and fiber as
77:14 - soon as i save this watch this
77:16 - boom looks nice right and then for the
77:20 - button
77:21 - i'm gonna go ahead and target the button
77:23 - so inside the form inside the button do
77:26 - display none because we don't actually
77:27 - want the button there so now if i type
77:28 - in
77:29 - enter we get a nice sort of functional
77:33 - working input tool okay
77:36 - so that's really really good to show the
77:38 - size says you're great at multitasking
77:40 - great work man honestly dude you get
77:41 - really good at it thank you for
77:43 - noticing that but yeah like i've got a
77:45 - stream deck as well so i can basically
77:46 - go like this any second i can go ahead
77:48 - and just do
77:48 - like fun stuff like this i could say oh
77:52 - things are gonna get real you know like
77:53 - you can do all this kind of fun stuff
77:55 - um but there's like you get really good
77:57 - i'm doing things with my left hand
77:58 - things with my right hand it's crazy but
77:59 - yeah
78:00 - back to the boat um
78:04 - binny binny says you give me hope that i
78:06 - could become a programmer
78:07 - thank you that's awesome man or girl
78:09 - thank you so much for that
78:13 - code codekid says man you are epic
78:16 - guys your energy is insane today really
78:18 - really thank you and also with that said
78:20 - we just broke over 500 likes on the
78:23 - this video amazing stuff guys thank you
78:26 - all
78:26 - for for watching and i really do
78:28 - appreciate and love each and every one
78:30 - of you
78:32 - right um nice
78:36 - i'm gonna go ahead and switch it back to
78:38 - this music i prefer this music
78:39 - right so now back to chat.js i'm gonna
78:42 - then
78:43 - actually next to so outside this form
78:47 - going back to chat.js outside this form
78:49 - we're gonna have a
78:50 - mic button okay so if you notice at the
78:52 - bottom of our build we have this little
78:54 - mic
78:54 - right so i'm going to go ahead and add
78:56 - that in but it's also an icon button
78:58 - which means remember i showed you that
78:59 - neat little trick earlier so it makes it
79:00 - a nice clickable button
79:02 - right um then what i'm going to do
79:05 - is i'm going to go ahead and first pop
79:07 - this in so i'm going to say
79:09 - boom i'm going to give it a class name
79:11 - so i can target it easier i'm going to
79:12 - say chat under squad underscore mic
79:15 - and i'm going to do this and now outside
79:18 - this i'm going to say
79:19 - icon button right and then everything
79:23 - inside the here should be mic
79:24 - like this right now for the icon button
79:26 - i'm going to import it
79:27 - same for this i'm going to import this
79:29 - but this one i need to actually import
79:30 - the top
79:31 - so i'm going to go up to the top and i'm
79:33 - going to go ahead and pop it in there
79:35 - save it boom uh so shank says this is
79:38 - the best one keep doing this bro
79:40 - nice thank you um
79:43 - yeah khalid says we're pumped nice
79:46 - that's
79:46 - it man keep this energy high there you
79:49 - go guys look at that we have that
79:51 - nice looking logo on the right okay
79:53 - that's looking good
79:54 - right now i'm going to show you a really
79:56 - neat little trick if you build things in
79:57 - the correct way actually
79:59 - implementing the functionality isn't
80:00 - that bad right
80:02 - so we have the chat messages i'm going
80:04 - to get rid of the
80:05 - comment here so now i'm going to build
80:06 - out the chat underscore messages
80:09 - yeah and inside of here we're just going
80:11 - to have a bunch of messages so like
80:12 - imagine this just says
80:14 - uh h2 of like i am
80:17 - a message save it
80:21 - and then you see it's like i have a
80:23 - message i'm gonna add a bunch of these
80:24 - in right
80:26 - i want this one to always take up this
80:28 - middle space so this should always be
80:29 - pushed to the bottom
80:30 - in order to do that what i do is i go
80:31 - into my chat.css
80:33 - and i go ahead and target chat messages
80:36 - and i just say flex1
80:37 - because the flex direction of this
80:38 - entire parent is column which means it
80:41 - should
80:42 - push to say use up as much room as
80:44 - possible
80:45 - and we get that functionality so that
80:47 - looks really really good
80:49 - um action says you look a bit burnt out
80:53 - uh videos are super amazing love the
80:55 - effort you are putting in
80:56 - uh appreciate the the consideration dude
80:59 - i'm all good though i'm all good thank
81:00 - you so much for asking
81:02 - um right so
81:05 - now what i'm gonna do is go back to
81:07 - chad.js
81:08 - and i am going to
81:12 - this is the next bit so where do we
81:13 - focus our attention to
81:15 - now let's go ahead and create the uh
81:18 - login
81:19 - section right now okay so login section
81:21 - for now so let's go back to our app.js
81:25 - so here i'm going to say app.js i'm
81:27 - going to go back here so
81:29 - what i'm going to say is i'm going to
81:30 - use redux here so
81:32 - redux i'm not going to actually go
81:34 - through fully of what redux
81:35 - does because yesterday's build we
81:37 - extensively went over some of the redux
81:38 - stuff
81:39 - so you can go ahead and watch that one
81:41 - and then today's one but i'm going to go
81:42 - ahead and break it down in a nice
81:44 - way for you guys so it's easy to
81:45 - understand so
81:47 - i'm going to go into features counter
81:49 - slice i'm going to rename counter slice
81:51 - so everything that says counter
81:53 - i'm going to call this the user slice
81:54 - okay
81:56 - so user now the initial state of the
81:59 - user slice is going to be user
82:01 - and then here i don't need any of this
82:03 - stuff i just want to
82:05 - go ahead and get rid of all these
82:06 - comments i'm simplifying my code right
82:07 - now
82:08 - and here i'm gonna have actually no let
82:10 - me get keep one of these
82:11 - i'll show you why i'm gonna go ahead and
82:14 - change this one to logout
82:16 - this one to login and then i'm gonna go
82:19 - ahead and get rid of this
82:21 - and this should be state.user
82:24 - equals and then we'll get we'll change
82:27 - this in a sec
82:28 - and then when we log in it's state and
82:30 - it passes an action
82:32 - just follow this refactoring step and it
82:34 - will make a lot of sense okay
82:36 - um and then this will be log out get rid
82:39 - of this
82:40 - because we export it so we can use it
82:41 - outside i'm going to get rid of all this
82:42 - crap
82:44 - i'm going to get rid of all of this i'm
82:47 - going to say select this is my selectors
82:49 - here so this is how i access my state
82:51 - afterwards
82:54 - and then yeah that's how we get
82:55 - everything up and running okay so with
82:57 - that done
82:58 - i'm going to go ahead and go back to app
83:00 - store.js
83:01 - i'm going to re change everything here
83:03 - so this will go ahead i'm going to
83:05 - change
83:06 - this over here to user reducer
83:10 - right and then it's going to freak out
83:12 - because we haven't got that file okay so
83:13 - i'm going to go back here
83:15 - and i'm going to go down to counter
83:17 - slice rename
83:19 - i'm going to change this to become user
83:21 - slice
83:22 - save it boom now we have it see
83:24 - everything's working
83:25 - now to test this works i'm going to open
83:27 - up my dev tool so i'm going to inspect
83:29 - go to redux and we should see if i go to
83:33 - the state we now have a user so i'm
83:35 - going to make this a bit more visible
83:36 - for you guys
83:37 - but i know my face is in the way so
83:40 - we've got the user where the user is
83:41 - zero right now so it's perfect
83:43 - okay so the user we don't actually want
83:44 - to be zero i'll go ahead and show you
83:46 - why
83:47 - how we fix that in a sec but now what we
83:49 - do is we go here and the user is not
83:51 - going to be
83:51 - zero by default the user is no okay
83:55 - then what we're going to do is this is
83:57 - just going to be action.payload and this
83:59 - will make sense afterwards
84:01 - and this when we log out the user gets
84:03 - reset to no
84:04 - that's what we do right now what we're
84:07 - going to do
84:08 - is i'm going to go ahead and quickly
84:09 - give you a quick rundown so this is a
84:11 - quick
84:11 - illustration of what we've done here so
84:13 - this build is using something called
84:14 - redux
84:15 - right now what is redux redux is
84:17 - essentially imagine we have a bunch of
84:19 - components inside of our app so this is
84:21 - a component called app.js right
84:23 - and then everything else is kind of
84:25 - rendered underneath it right so we have
84:27 - like the chat component the header
84:28 - component the sidebar component
84:30 - all of these things right we have chat
84:31 - we have sidebar we have header i mean
84:34 - everything's actually inside of imessage
84:35 - but you know you get the point
84:37 - and then we have message and so forth
84:38 - now imagine we have all these things
84:40 - right
84:41 - so everything gets rendered here
84:44 - and then you also have more components
84:46 - underneath here right so you can have
84:48 - different things being rendered off
84:50 - of these components and and vice versa
84:52 - right
84:53 - now imagine we had a login component
84:56 - over here
84:57 - right now imagine we had when we do the
84:59 - login we get a user object
85:01 - right what if i want to use the the user
85:04 - object
85:05 - over here so what if i want to use the
85:07 - user object over here
85:10 - right if i want to use the user object
85:12 - over here how the hell do i get from
85:15 - here here sorry all the way
85:18 - over here right it's kind of annoying i
85:20 - kind of have to do this long journey
85:22 - of somehow getting my so maybe i
85:25 - initialize the user
85:26 - over here and i pass the setter down
85:27 - there and then i have to do something
85:29 - called prop drilling
85:30 - pass it to this component and then pass
85:32 - it to this one and if i want it over
85:33 - here i need to pass it down to this one
85:35 - and
85:35 - you can already see this is getting
85:36 - super messy right we don't want to do
85:38 - any of this
85:39 - so what we can do is we can introduce
85:41 - something called a data layer or
85:43 - something like redux right so redux kind
85:45 - of essentially surrounds the app
85:46 - right so this is essentially redux and
85:49 - now redux is essentially like an onion
85:50 - so imagine like an onion so this is
85:52 - onion surrounding our app now an onion
85:54 - has different slices inside of it
85:56 - now each slice inside of redux resembles
85:58 - different
86:00 - contexts or like different things inside
86:02 - of our app so we have a user slice
86:04 - and this is going to be responsible for
86:05 - all of the user information then we have
86:07 - something like an app slice
86:09 - this is going to be all the generic
86:10 - information about the app and we can
86:12 - have something like a basket slice
86:14 - and this would basically be uh so i'm
86:16 - just gonna say basket slice
86:17 - right and this would essentially be all
86:19 - of the things inside of the basket
86:21 - so you see and these all belong inside
86:23 - of the layers of the onions right
86:26 - and then what we can do now is when we
86:27 - get a login uh
86:29 - when we do get the user at this side
86:31 - what we can do is we can actually push
86:32 - the user into the data layer
86:34 - so inside of this and then anywhere
86:36 - inside the app so if i want the user
86:38 - uh over here what i can do is i can just
86:41 - grab the user
86:42 - so the user is part of the data layer i
86:44 - can grab the user and just use them in
86:46 - this component
86:46 - and if i need to use the user over here
86:49 - and go ahead and grab the user out of
86:50 - the data layer
86:51 - here so you see once we have it we don't
86:53 - need to pass props around and things
86:55 - like that we can just kind of
86:57 - push things into the data layer by
86:58 - dispatching actions like the login
87:00 - action to get the user into the data
87:01 - layer
87:02 - and then we can pull out the user
87:03 - wherever we want and in order to do this
87:05 - we use something called a selector so in
87:07 - this case it would be like select user
87:10 - okay so i hope that makes a bit more
87:12 - sense if it doesn't
87:14 - feel free to go ahead and check out
87:16 - yesterday's build and that's going to
87:18 - help you guys
87:19 - uh quite a lot nice i saw somebody says
87:22 - onion incoming
87:23 - nice i love how you guys know what's
87:25 - going now
87:26 - um so that's going to help you guys
87:28 - understand things a little bit more okay
87:31 - ali says you guys rock makes it easy to
87:33 - understand really appreciate it
87:36 - all right so with that done
87:39 - and said i'm going to go ahead and
87:41 - create this
87:42 - right here so we've done that now um the
87:45 - next thing is i'm also going to go ahead
87:47 - and prepare
87:48 - something as well so somebody says so
87:50 - what is the disadvantage
87:52 - disadvantages of using the context api
87:54 - at this point
87:55 - so the disadvantages are so it's not
87:57 - this much it's more like redux is more
87:59 - powerful so
88:00 - we for one we have these beautiful redux
88:02 - devtools
88:03 - so over here we have nice little redux
88:05 - devtools where
88:06 - and trust me this comes in very very
88:08 - handy later on so
88:10 - we're going to be using that today also
88:12 - you split your pieces of state
88:14 - into different like uh areas so for
88:17 - example the basket slice the user slice
88:19 - the app slice and things like that
88:21 - so it's a lot more um oh this is a good
88:24 - question actually so logan says it says
88:26 - redux like an object that has pointers
88:28 - from app.js and all its children so
88:30 - think of it as like global
88:32 - state so as an easier way of thinking it
88:35 - right
88:35 - so global state and then all the
88:37 - children beneath app.js
88:39 - or pretty much inside of your app have
88:42 - access to that global state
88:43 - think of it that way you dispatch an
88:45 - action to go ahead and manipulate that
88:47 - global state
88:48 - and then you use selectors to pull from
88:50 - that global state right
88:52 - so in other words always accessible yes
88:54 - pretty much exactly so we have like
88:56 - things like the user is always
88:57 - accessible from any component inside of
88:59 - the app
89:00 - um so i think that's going to help
89:03 - everyone out
89:04 - now to your places last time your video
89:05 - helped me a lot thanks
89:07 - awesome stuff jennifer says hey sonny oh

90:27 - like dragon atom i still did
90:30 - amazing stuff um
90:35 - all right logan interesting i love like
90:36 - to see a partially compiled reactor with
90:38 - redux to see how it's actually using
90:39 - redux
90:40 - i'm actually going to show you today so
90:41 - stick around logan um and i'm going to
90:43 - show you when we actually dispatch
90:45 - actions how it modifies
90:47 - the state inside of the app um and it's
90:49 - going to be pretty cool
90:50 - david atta says suddenly you get my job
90:53 - count before december ends
90:56 - ah so i'm talking about dude let's do it
90:58 - david
91:00 - um um okay this is awesome
91:04 - future code says there there's one sure
91:06 - thing consistent and keep building these
91:07 - clones you will get a job
91:09 - many of us are proof no matter what your
91:11 - background or level is it's just a
91:12 - matter of time
91:14 - elizabeth is somebody i do one-on-one
91:15 - coaching with uh future code
91:17 - she literally landed a job and now she's
91:20 - doing coaching with me still to kind of
91:22 - keep her skills up today and up to sort
91:24 - of scratch

91:34 - it makes me
91:34 - so happy to go ahead and hear that
91:39 - oh man i think i talk like 20 000 words
91:43 - a minute when i'm ready
91:44 - alive okay so uh ashfaq says you're
91:48 - my inspiration and motivation to move to
91:50 - web development amazing dude thank you
91:52 - so much
91:52 - blackout says thank you appreciate you
91:54 - dude um
91:56 - oh another job holy crap dude
91:59 - he says sonny i got a job at local

92:14 - drop him some love that's amazing to see
92:15 - that right
92:17 - we've got kansas in the house um
92:20 - he goes you're my coding inspiration i'm
92:21 - from kansas and we love you dude
92:23 - appreciate that dude
92:24 - amazing stuff right back to the build so
92:27 - here we have i am a message right
92:29 - uh so what we're gonna do is actually go
92:31 - ahead and prepare
92:32 - the login flow so firstly i need to go
92:34 - ahead and set up firebase so i'm gonna
92:36 - go to firebase.google.com
92:38 - uh make sure all you need is a google
92:39 - account i'm going to go to the console
92:41 - over here i'm going to click on add
92:43 - project then i'm going to go ahead and
92:45 - say
92:46 - imessage clone right
92:49 - when i say i message clone on youtube
92:52 - i'm going to enable google analytics you
92:53 - don't need to enable google analytics
92:54 - but you can if you want
92:56 - i'm going to go ahead and create the
92:57 - project all right now
93:00 - nikhil says sunny how can i do mentoring
93:02 - coaching with you
93:03 - just drop me a dm on my instagram at
93:06 - ssssanga
93:07 - so the one you can see on the screen uh
93:10 - or here it might be easier to see
93:11 - so you can see it over there go ahead
93:13 - follow me send me a dm just saying
93:15 - one-on-one coaching and pretty much we
93:16 - can have a conversation dude
93:18 - um and yeah and also send me an email as
93:21 - well as
93:22 - well uh to get the best chance of
93:23 - getting through to me but yeah that'll
93:25 - be awesome
93:26 - um nice
93:29 - all right so clicking on continue
93:33 - right so next what we're gonna do we're
93:34 - going to click this little web button
93:36 - over here
93:37 - and here i'm going to say imessage clone
93:40 - youtube set up firebase hosting boom
93:43 - register the app
93:44 - right okay so you drop to dm nice
93:47 - i get hundreds of dm so i'll go ahead
93:49 - and search through that um
93:50 - maybe send me another one and i can
93:52 - pretty much see that uh we're gonna
93:54 - click next
93:55 - and continues to the console nice people
93:58 - say why firebase because firebase has a
93:59 - real-time database so we're gonna
94:01 - use cloud firestore which is like the
94:03 - nosql real-time database so powerful
94:05 - version
94:06 - it also has authentication it has a
94:09 - bunch of stuff you are trending number
94:10 - four for imessage
94:11 - damn let's go man trending on youtube so
94:15 - that's insane
94:16 - all right so we're gonna go to
94:17 - authentication over here on the left
94:19 - and the first thing we're gonna do is
94:21 - click sign in method what's up
94:22 - alexandros could see you did
94:24 - uh always recognize the face so we're
94:26 - gonna go to google
94:28 - i'm gonna click enable okay i need to
94:31 - enable an email
94:32 - there we go click save okay so that's
94:34 - done
94:35 - and then i'm going to go to this little
94:36 - cog at the top project settings
94:38 - i'm going to go down to config and click
94:41 - the copy button
94:42 - okay i'm going to head back over to my
94:44 - code now and what i want to do is create
94:46 - a firebase.js file so firebase.js
94:51 - right and here i'm going to pull up my
94:53 - terminal i'm going to do mpmi
94:56 - firebase i need to install firebase into
94:58 - my project
95:00 - now while that's doing i'm going to
95:01 - paste
95:03 - and we've got the firebase config then
95:06 - i'm going to say
95:06 - import firebase from firebase because we
95:09 - just
95:10 - we're literally installing it down below
95:12 - as you can see down here
95:13 - and while that's happening guys i can go
95:14 - ahead and set up the next thing so i can
95:16 - go ahead and say const firebase app
95:18 - equals firebase dot initialize app with
95:21 - that config so this is basically going
95:22 - to use this like a key
95:24 - to get into the uh into our firebase
95:27 - end right so um nice he goes man you
95:30 - guys have energy doing all these
95:31 - tutorials yeah man the energy is high
95:34 - today let's go
95:35 - um also here thank you so much raj um he
95:37 - says superb video appreciate you
95:39 - watching dude
95:40 - thank you so much logan very good point
95:43 - here he says firebase is also classified
95:44 - as a back end as a service
95:46 - so it's cutting down the work of the
95:47 - build considerably a hundred billion
95:49 - percent i couldn't agree with that more
95:51 - really nice way of doing it um
95:54 - explaining it uh somebody says firebase
95:55 - is so expensive no dude
95:57 - firebase is free right so
96:01 - and also google if you ever watch this
96:02 - video sponsor us you know
96:04 - guess guess in with the good rates um so
96:07 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
96:08 - to say
96:08 - constdb equals firebaseapp.firestore
96:12 - so that will go ahead and do it hey if
96:15 - uh
96:15 - khalid says hey i'll dm you the off
96:17 - letter i got keep an eye out for my
96:18 - insta at the real
96:19 - skypes skies nice dude go ahead and send
96:22 - that to me and i'll be awesome
96:24 - right um right
96:28 - uh okay and somebody this is a good
96:30 - point nikhil says i feel like we need
96:31 - journey of react
96:32 - of papa react and how he reached level
96:35 - and from what all resources
96:37 - if you guys want to see that i might
96:38 - actually start shooting some content on
96:39 - my youtube channel
96:41 - which goes behind kind of getting to
96:43 - know me a bit more
96:44 - i guess getting to know me my story that
96:46 - sort of stuff if you guys want to see
96:48 - that
96:48 - then let me know and i'll start shooting
96:50 - more content on my personal account
96:52 - and you know it's just kind of fun you

97:04 - sanga on youtube go ahead and check it
97:06 - out
97:07 - um right so with that said now what i'm
97:10 - going to do is i'm also going to say
97:11 - const auth
97:12 - equals firebase.auth right so this is
97:15 - all prepared preparation so this is
97:16 - already done
97:18 - um nice so many people are saying
97:21 - damn yes honestly start a vlogging
97:23 - channel we would love to know more about
97:24 - you
97:25 - um yeah okay i heard you did
97:29 - um loads of people saying it do it it's
97:30 - cool if you've subscribed to me then
97:32 - keep an eye out okay
97:34 - logan says yeah bro you should just vlog
97:36 - on your days out yeah you know i should

97:38 - doing fun stuff going out and about so
97:40 - i think that'll be awesome uh yeah 100
97:44 - um you guys killed my depression damn
97:47 - love that
97:48 - um you also made me passionate about
97:50 - programming love your content that's
97:51 - amazing
97:52 - and i'm so glad to hear that we helped
97:54 - you out on that journey right
97:56 - the next thing we want to do guys is go
97:58 - ahead and go down here and say
98:00 - cons provider equals new firebase.google
98:02 - author provider so this is like where
98:04 - the magic happens
98:05 - to go ahead and connect it um to
98:08 - somebody says i love you continue thank
98:10 - you so much
98:12 - we're going to go ahead and export the
98:15 - two things so we're
98:16 - going to export um something can you
98:19 - mention these
98:20 - firebase imports exports so they are
98:22 - mentioned that are the methods given by
98:23 - 5s yeah
98:24 - so all of these imports right here so
98:26 - you see like this
98:28 - whereas firebase this is all from
98:30 - firebase it's firebase dot initializing
98:32 - the app firebase app
98:33 - this is using this what we just
98:34 - initialized to go ahead
98:36 - and um get grab the database grab the
98:40 - authentication and then we pretty much
98:41 - go ahead and get our authentication
98:44 - provider
98:45 - right so
98:49 - with this bit done now what we're going
98:50 - to do is i'm going to export
98:53 - the authentication and the provider as
98:55 - something called a
98:56 - explicit uh export and then we'll undo
98:59 - this as our default
99:01 - export so export default
99:04 - db and the reason why i like to do the
99:06 - default db is because we use the db a
99:08 - bit more
99:08 - so i think it's always nice to kind of
99:10 - have the db as your default okay
99:13 - um firebase must just be one monstrous
99:15 - class
99:16 - so obviously even they kind of once it's
99:19 - done and the hard work's done they kind
99:21 - of like compile it into a very
99:23 - nice minified piece of code and i think
99:25 - that's going to be
99:26 - and that's what you end up looking at
99:30 - so if i go ahead and i'll show you
99:32 - actually so if i go ahead and
99:34 - click over onto firebase for example and
99:36 - click into you see like you get the
99:38 - actual typescript files
99:40 - you can see this is their kind of code
99:42 - behind the screen so this is their type
99:43 - definitions
99:44 - um so it doesn't actually show you the
99:46 - code as such because the code is going
99:48 - to be inside of here
99:49 - so you see this is what they did to
99:51 - their code it's all minified
99:53 - um but yeah you can see but then they
99:55 - give you type definitions and that's
99:56 - what that's what gives
99:58 - vs code the ability to go ahead and
100:00 - check out um
100:02 - what is like available when you do when
100:04 - you press like
100:05 - dot and things like that okay so we've
100:07 - set up firebase that's all good now we
100:09 - go back to our chat
100:10 - and what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna
100:12 - go ahead and do the login flow
100:14 - okay so login flow is inside of app.js
100:18 - so here
100:19 - right so we're gonna firstly create a
100:22 - we've already got a user here we've got
100:23 - the select user so what i can do is i
100:26 - can actually use this
100:26 - i can use the select user so i'm going
100:28 - to pull the user
100:30 - here and i'm going to say const user
100:34 - equals use selector and this is from
100:37 - react redux so we need to go ahead and
100:39 - import and then i need to go ahead and
100:41 - say select
100:42 - user and this will import it from
100:43 - features user slice
100:45 - so we're basically going ahead and
100:46 - pulling the user so by default the user
100:49 - will be no
100:50 - okay these are going to be no by default
100:52 - and that's going to go ahead
100:54 - and that's going to give you um nice and
100:57 - somebody says
100:58 - rzo movie trailer says this is cool glad
101:00 - you're enjoying it dude
101:01 - and if you are enjoying and you're still
101:03 - with me smash the thumbs up button
101:04 - almost
101:05 - at 600 likes um so we've got imessage
101:09 - over here
101:10 - and what i'm going to say is if you're
101:12 - logged in so if there is a user if the
101:13 - user exists
101:15 - then what we're going to do is i'm going
101:16 - to say then you render the app
101:18 - so then we render it otherwise yeah i
101:20 - want to render something h2 saying you
101:22 - need
101:23 - to log in okay you need to log in
101:28 - uh we are going to have a logout flow i
101:30 - just made it very discreet in the
101:32 - previous
101:33 - uh example but for example if we're here
101:35 - all you do is you click on the actual
101:37 - icon at the top and it will log you out
101:39 - and that's pretty much how it works i'm
101:42 - just gonna log in
101:44 - again there we go going back boom
101:47 - um all right so there we go uh you see
101:50 - now what it does is it says
101:53 - if there is a user it will render the
101:55 - app otherwise if there's not a user so
101:57 - by default there is no user
101:58 - you need to log in right so this
102:01 - is a good place where we need to be
102:03 - right now so now we're going to build
102:05 - the login
102:05 - page so rather than saying you need to
102:07 - log in i'm going to create a login
102:08 - component
102:09 - okay i'm going to go ahead and create
102:11 - that now so go here and
102:14 - hide all this stuff i'm going to say
102:15 - login.js
102:17 - and i'm going to rfce boom got it and
102:19 - then here we're going to say import
102:22 - login.css
102:25 - and i'm going to go down here to div i'm
102:27 - gonna say class name equals
102:29 - login right and then inside of here
102:32 - we're gonna basically go ahead and build
102:34 - our login but firstly before i do that
102:36 - i'm gonna go ahead and say login.css and
102:39 - then i'm gonna go back to my uh
102:41 - app.js and here i'm going to go ahead
102:44 - and import
102:45 - login like that
102:48 - and now we should be rendering from our
102:51 - login components so i'm going to go here
102:53 - and say login.js
102:58 - um yeah that interpolation is is crazy
103:01 - right so
103:02 - so that's actually called a ternary or
103:04 - uh ternary operator where you can have
103:06 - that sort of
103:07 - if this then that right you can have
103:09 - that as well so that's really really
103:10 - handy
103:10 - to go ahead and use that um so here
103:12 - we're going to have the login
103:14 - login page i guess right so
103:17 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
103:20 - actually going to have a
103:21 - login logo so i'm gonna have a login
103:24 - uh logo inside of here i'm gonna have an
103:27 - image
103:27 - the image source i've actually got an
103:30 - image over here this is just pretty much
103:32 - a imessage image so i'm just gonna go
103:34 - ahead and pop that in
103:35 - boom it's a huge imessage uh
103:38 - image and then i've got a h2 underneath
103:40 - it uh h1 which is going to say imessage
103:44 - right and this will pretty much be down
103:46 - here so you can see it says imessage
103:47 - underneath that i'm going to have a
103:49 - material ui button
103:50 - which says sign in okay
103:54 - uh it says button is not fine so i'm
103:55 - going to do my little trick
103:57 - and then it says imported and that trick
104:00 - is control spacebar and it will go ahead
104:01 - and pop that up so now we've got a nice
104:03 - little sign-in button at the bottom
104:04 - okay so first thing i'm going to do is
104:06 - style this so that way it looks a little
104:07 - bit more presentable
104:08 - so let's go to our login.css and
104:12 - then let's go ahead and do login.css
104:15 - so down here i'm going to do dot login
104:18 - i'm going to say display grid because
104:20 - we're using a grid css grid here
104:22 - i'm going to show you guys a neat little
104:23 - trick so if i do place item center
104:27 - this will actually position everything
104:28 - in the center but you can't see that
104:30 - right now because
104:31 - it's not actually showing much so i'm
104:32 - going to go ahead target the inner div
104:34 - the image which is this huge thing
104:36 - object fit contain keeps the aspect
104:38 - ratio when i resize it and height of 150
104:40 - pixels
104:41 - makes it small right if i get rid of
104:43 - this display grid now
104:45 - see everything goes to left so if i do
104:47 - this it centers it on the on the screen
104:49 - right
104:49 - so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm
104:50 - going to say a height of 100 view height
104:52 - this will go ahead and make use of the
104:54 - full screen and then i'm going to say a
104:56 - width of 100
104:57 - right so width of 100 all right i
105:00 - actually don't think i need that but i'm
105:01 - going to keep that for now
105:03 - uh and then what we're going to do is
105:04 - i'm going to go and target that button
105:06 - so i'm going to say target the login
105:09 - button right and i'm going to say width
105:12 - of
105:13 - 300 pixels i want the button to be a
105:14 - little bit bigger i'm also going to give
105:16 - it a background color and this is going
105:17 - to be the imessage blue
105:19 - so boom save that and then we're going
105:21 - to change the color of the text to like
105:23 - a more subtle white
105:24 - i'm going to say the font weight should
105:26 - be 800 as well so i'm going to make a
105:27 - little bit more bold
105:29 - um 800 boom and let's do that
105:33 - save and there you go looks pretty good
105:34 - right now when we hover over it
105:36 - i want to get a little bit more
105:37 - attractive so right now you see it kind
105:39 - of goes white by default
105:40 - we that we can't have that doesn't make
105:42 - sense i'm gonna have it invert
105:44 - essentially and have the color be blue
105:46 - and the background be gray so that looks
105:48 - a bit more cleaner
105:49 - all right so this is all working pretty
105:51 - well okay
105:54 - so alexander says why grid and not flex
105:56 - because that's a really easy trick
105:58 - this one so you can just position the
105:59 - entire container um
106:01 - centrally so it's actually a very very
106:03 - neat thing if you need to do something
106:05 - pretty quick
106:06 - in this case i just wanted to have it
106:07 - very quick and simple in the center of
106:08 - the screen so i went ahead and used
106:10 - css grid right so now what we're going
106:14 - to do is we're going to implement the
106:15 - login functionality so it's a lot easier
106:16 - than you think
106:17 - right because we've set everything up
106:19 - correctly so if you code well guys
106:21 - code something well and then you'll see
106:24 - building on it and all that sort of
106:25 - stuff actually gets
106:26 - very simple because it's not hard to add
106:28 - to well-written code
106:29 - right it's not hard to add to the
106:31 - extensive like extensibility
106:32 - maintainability of while we're in code
106:33 - so
106:34 - with that said what i'm going to do is
106:35 - i'm going to create a function called
106:37 - sign in so i'm going to say const sign
106:38 - in
106:40 - takes an event but we don't actually
106:41 - care about the event so we can ignore
106:43 - that
106:44 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say i
106:47 - need to import the authentication module
106:49 - and the provider from firebase our local
106:52 - firebase
106:53 - that we had earlier right and then if i
106:55 - go down
106:56 - here what i'm going to have is when i
106:58 - click the button
106:59 - i want to basically trigger my sign in
107:02 - function
107:03 - okay and i'm going to make the um
107:07 - yeah we have that so now all i need to
107:09 - do is say auth
107:10 - dot sign in with pop-up
107:13 - okay i go here and i say provider
107:17 - because we initialize this earlier and i
107:19 - don't want to do anything more than that
107:20 - all i want to say is catch if there's
107:22 - any error
107:23 - i'm going to get the error and i'm
107:24 - literally just going to say alert
107:26 - error dot message that's what i'm going
107:28 - to say
107:29 - right alert error.message and that will
107:31 - go ahead and help you out
107:34 - um so if i go ahead and refresh um now
107:36 - if i click sign in
107:37 - boom i get a nice little pop-up and this
107:40 - should be a google authentication
107:41 - sign-in
107:42 - there we go look at that everything's
107:43 - connected if you guys think that's cool
107:45 - hit the thumbs up button
107:47 - um that would be amazing to see that
107:49 - number go up to 600 likes we're close
107:52 - we're close i think we can do it
107:54 - um that's awesome stuff
107:57 - okay so with that said now we're still
108:01 - at 250 concurrent viewers that's amazing
108:03 - thank you so much guys
108:04 - um i'm going to have it so now if i look
108:07 - say for example if i've closed it early
108:08 - you see an error occurred so it says
108:10 - uh the alert got caught here and it
108:13 - displayed the message which is what we
108:14 - want okay
108:16 - so now what we need to do is whenever a
108:18 - login event action
108:19 - occurs inside of app.js i'm going to
108:22 - have a listener
108:23 - so a user factor is what we're going to
108:25 - use here so a use effect
108:27 - i'm going to import it from react and
108:30 - then here i'm going to write the use
108:31 - effect
108:32 - use effect is a piece of code that fires
108:34 - off when the component loads
108:36 - and if you put anything inside these
108:37 - square brackets it will fire off again
108:40 - when that changes for example if i had
108:41 - the user in here every time
108:43 - this would fire off once when the app
108:44 - component loads as well as whenever user
108:47 - changes in any shape or form okay so
108:50 - here what i'm going to say
108:51 - is i want to import the authentication
108:53 - module from our local firebase
108:55 - so i'm going to go ahead import it and
108:57 - then here i'm going to say
108:59 - auth dot uh on auth state change this is
109:03 - like listening now
109:04 - for authentication changes and i'm going
109:05 - to say when
109:07 - any sort of change occurs go ahead and
109:09 - use the auth user
109:11 - so i'm going to do that and i'm going to
109:13 - say if there was an authenticated user
109:17 - then the
109:20 - user is logged in
109:24 - else the user is
109:28 - logged out that's basically the logical
109:30 - flow
109:31 - and then what we're going to do is we're
109:32 - going to get the dispatch remember
109:34 - earlier on i drew that diagram
109:36 - uh whenever we want to add something
109:38 - into the data layer or the redux of
109:40 - onion that i described earlier what we
109:42 - need to do is we need to use the
109:43 - dispatch so here i'm going to say use
109:45 - dispatch um and then i'm going to import
109:48 - it from react
109:49 - react redux so use this patch all we say
109:51 - is we say const
109:52 - dispatch equals use dispatch this gives
109:56 - me like the gun to go ahead and fire
109:59 - a change into um
110:04 - i'm just checking the chat okay yeah
110:07 - goes ahead
110:08 - and um yeah so now we get the gun to go
110:10 - ahead and
110:11 - and fire changes our actions into the
110:14 - reducer so that way it can
110:16 - change the data so now we've got that
110:18 - i'm going to go ahead and
110:19 - import the login
110:23 - and log out action from the user
110:26 - right and then what i'm going to say is
110:27 - if the user's logged if the user is
110:29 - logged out i'm going to say dispatch a
110:30 - logout event
110:32 - right and then if we go to our user
110:34 - slice the logout event simply clears the
110:36 - state.user to know
110:37 - again and then here i'm going to say
110:41 - um
110:44 - someone's asking about kaio kailan uh
110:47 - dude i'm not going to speak about
110:48 - java on this channel right now okay so
110:51 - it's all javascript
110:52 - okay so um what i'm going to say is
110:55 - dispatch login
110:56 - so dispatch login and i'm going to pass
110:58 - in a payload which is an object
111:01 - and here i'm just going to pass in the
111:02 - following we'll say uid
111:05 - is the authentication user so this is
111:07 - what comes back from google
111:09 - so we're going to basically we're
111:10 - basically creating an object for the
111:12 - user we're saying that he should have a
111:13 - photo
111:14 - or she shall follow the user auth user
111:17 - dot
111:19 - photo url and this comes back from
111:22 - google authentication
111:23 - let's say an email and this comes back
111:25 - as auth
111:27 - user.email and then we also
111:29 - have the display name so if they have a
111:32 - name on google for example google
111:34 - collects your name when you sign up we
111:35 - should be able to get that from here so
111:37 - we say auth user dot
111:38 - display name okay save that and now you
111:41 - can see we get everything here
111:42 - so with that said now what should happen
111:45 - is we should see
111:46 - if i could have done this correctly if i
111:48 - go to redox
111:49 - now we should see so it logged me so
111:51 - right now for refresh
111:53 - so i log out because we're not logged in
111:55 - right now so you see inside of our
111:56 - reducer
111:58 - inside of our state we see actual user
112:00 - of no which is why i see the sign in
112:02 - screen
112:02 - if i click sign up notice pay attention
112:04 - to over on the right hand side of the
112:06 - screen
112:06 - and if this works go ahead and smash the
112:08 - thumbs up button okay
112:10 - um let's go ahead and click on sunny
112:13 - let's angle gmail so it should go ahead
112:15 - and say user
112:16 - login so there you go it dispatched a
112:18 - login and look at that guys it actually
112:20 - logged us
112:20 - in so that's dope and everything
112:25 - worked as we wanted it right
112:28 - so that's awesome i cut that one up
112:31 - earlier
112:32 - so that's working as we wanted it okay
112:35 - so
112:36 - and you can see now if i inspect the
112:38 - action it's in the user slice
112:41 - and it was the login action okay now the
112:44 - payload for the user
112:45 - was the user id the photo the email and
112:48 - the display name
112:49 - right so everything works on that front
112:51 - and then you can see the diff
112:52 - is also really really handy so you could
112:56 - do your auth user but inside of redux
112:59 - uh it comes up with a serialization
113:01 - issue because you're trying to
113:04 - conveniently sort of serialize that that
113:07 - object so
113:08 - you'll get an error if you do auth uh
113:10 - user or
113:11 - user um but you can that's why i've just
113:13 - stripped out some of the values but
113:14 - there's a way of doing it in that in
113:15 - that way yeah
113:17 - so now you can see um inside the state
113:21 - the user is populated right so any if i
113:24 - was to refresh
113:26 - look what happens it refreshes and it
113:27 - dispatches the login
113:30 - and it dispatches login so persistence
113:32 - is here
113:34 - right so that's awesome so with that
113:37 - said
113:37 - go ahead and smash the thumbs up button
113:40 - because we're almost at 600
113:41 - likes and the log out functionality i'm
113:44 - going to implement right now for you
113:45 - guys
113:46 - so to log out what i'm going to do is
113:48 - i'm going to have it firstly let's
113:49 - actually go ahead and pull some
113:51 - information
113:52 - from where we didn't need it right so
113:54 - here at the top where we have the avatar
113:57 - so let's go to our sidebar right now
113:59 - inside the sidebar we have the avatar at
114:01 - the top here
114:03 - now i'm going to go ahead and grab the
114:04 - user i'm going to say const user equals
114:05 - use selector
114:07 - and i'm going to say select user which
114:09 - is my selector that i created earlier
114:10 - and i've
114:11 - done all the appropriate imports i
114:12 - needed now with the user
114:14 - what i can do is i can go here and i can
114:16 - say source should be
114:18 - user dot photo
114:21 - now watch what happens boom grab my
114:24 - google login i think that's dope
114:27 - i think that's so dope i think this is
114:29 - getting pretty cool with five likes away
114:31 - from 600 likes pretty sick
114:35 - right when i click on this i want to log
114:37 - out so you're probably wondering oh
114:39 - there's
114:39 - there's a lot of custom coding not
114:41 - really dude what you do is on click
114:43 - and i here i'm going to say i'm going to
114:45 - import the authentication module from
114:47 - firebase
114:48 - to my local firebase so here
114:52 - uh some people are saying how can this
114:53 - be for beginners you're going so fast
114:55 - remember guys this is recorded okay so
114:58 - this
114:58 - is not at the whole point of a live
115:00 - stream it's not meant to be so you can
115:01 - completely like sit alone and type with
115:03 - me
115:04 - it's meant to be so you can enjoy the
115:06 - video watch it
115:07 - you know just enjoy seeing some live
115:09 - coding and things like that
115:10 - and then you can pretty much go ahead
115:12 - and uh pause the video and do it at your
115:15 - own pace
115:16 - afterwards when you watch it back
115:18 - because remember if i was to sit here
115:19 - and wait for everyone
115:20 - that's watching to kind of catch up it's
115:22 - not gonna the video is gonna be a lot
115:24 - longer and a lot less people are gonna
115:25 - find value from it so
115:27 - don't worry it is it is a beginner
115:28 - friendly video you can pretty much go
115:30 - ahead and follow this from start to
115:31 - finish as a beginner
115:32 - and we have plenty of people that have
115:33 - done it and they land their job so quit
115:35 - your complaining
115:36 - let's go all right so here what we're
115:39 - going to do now is i'm going to say
115:41 - an anonymous function auth dot sign out
115:45 - right and then i'm going to say save it
115:48 - and now what we can see is i'm going to
115:50 - show you guys proof of something so i'm
115:52 - going to go here
115:54 - and redux and now you see it signed in
115:56 - so if i go ahead and refresh
116:00 - this is a good comment by the way ayo
116:01 - says for beginners see three to four
116:03 - bills continuously and you'll get the
116:04 - pattern
116:05 - dude exactly exactly that like keep
116:08 - doing that and you're gonna go ahead and
116:10 - see the pattern
116:10 - and it will make a lot of sense right so
116:14 - uh what i want to show you is yes so it
116:15 - dispatched the login up here right
116:17 - now if i go ahead and click the uh the
116:19 - avatar
116:20 - it dispatches a logout action which went
116:22 - ahead and reset the user
116:24 - move my face out of the way it reset the
116:26 - user to no
116:28 - right so now inside the state you should
116:31 - see the user
116:32 - is now no okay so that's what that went
116:34 - ahead and did
116:36 - right so what i'm going to do now is i'm
116:38 - just going to make this
116:40 - actually a little bit smaller so you
116:42 - guys can actually see that bit easier
116:43 - right
116:44 - so there we go um i mean i'm tiny now
116:47 - that's the only thing
116:48 - we're going to make it a little bit
116:49 - bigger i like it it's too small okay
116:51 - so now let me go ahead and sign back in
116:55 - yo
116:56 - athava he goes my mind is blown at the
116:58 - progress i just see right now
117:00 - the blog may go over 5k when i wake up
117:02 - hey let's go dude we just dropped a
117:03 - crazy
117:04 - clever programmer vlog on medium
117:06 - authority go ahead and feel free to drop
117:08 - that on the live chat right
117:10 - now uh and everyone can go ahead and
117:11 - check out the blog when they got a
117:12 - minute
117:13 - there we go so now what we're going to
117:16 - do is it says the channel name
117:18 - and we have the messages right so i
117:20 - guess the next step right now
117:22 - is we want to have this chant these
117:23 - channels right here populated
117:25 - as well as we'll get these messages
117:27 - built out and so forth so for the
117:28 - channel names
117:29 - what we're going to do is these channels
117:31 - are going to not be hard-coded so right
117:33 - now
117:33 - they're hard-coded three sort of things
117:35 - are being popped out right here
117:37 - okay uh also this is a good question do
117:39 - you think react is the way to go on web
117:41 - development i mean is it the future
117:42 - 100 the demand is to the roof and it is
117:46 - really getting busy also
117:47 - we just hit 605 likes thank you so much
117:51 - guys amazing stuff
117:52 - uh love the positivity today and yeah
117:55 - like let's keep going let's try and hit
117:57 - like
117:58 - 700 likes i think we can do it i think
117:59 - we can hit 700 likes
118:01 - um nice that's dope dude also a darva
118:04 - just dropped a link to that 50 page plus
118:07 - amazon complete read through breakdown
118:11 - inside the comment section go ahead and
118:12 - check that out in a sec
118:14 - or maybe open in a separate tab and
118:16 - pretty much you can watch that and read
118:17 - that afterwards but amazing stuff by
118:19 - atarva
118:20 - team is absolutely crushing it man it's
118:23 - insane
118:24 - team is crushing it so here what i'm
118:27 - going to do now
118:28 - is i'm going to have the sidebar.js
118:32 - right
118:32 - and the first thing i'm going to do here
118:34 - is have a piece of state to keep track
118:36 - of this the chats
118:37 - so i'm going to say const charts equal
118:39 - and then set chats
118:41 - and i'm going to say use state right and
118:44 - it's going to have an array empty to
118:45 - ready to begin with
118:46 - now when the app when the sidebar
118:48 - component loads i'm going to use a user
118:50 - effect to fire off piece of code
118:53 - so boom like so right now in here i'm
118:56 - going to have empty brackets for the
118:58 - dependencies
118:59 - um so it's just going to fire off once
119:02 - all right tommy o says i love your cone
119:04 - streams dude i love you guys
119:06 - man i love the support you guys give us
119:08 - it's the only reason i carry on doing
119:09 - them so that's really really awesome to
119:11 - see that
119:12 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
119:13 - to import
119:15 - the db from our local firebase
119:18 - and i'm going to say db.collection so
119:21 - i'm going to create a collection
119:22 - and inside here we're going to have a
119:23 - collection of chats right
119:25 - and i'm going to say on snapshot so it's
119:28 - going to be a real-time listener which
119:29 - gives us a snapshot of the database
119:31 - whenever anything changes
119:33 - right now when that changes i'm going to
119:35 - say set chats
119:37 - right so as soon as anything in the
119:38 - database changes we get
119:40 - a snapshot and when we get that snapshot
119:42 - back i'm going to say okay go get the
119:44 - snapshot
119:45 - get the document inside the snapshot
119:47 - this is a nosql structure right so if
119:49 - you don't understand what i'm talking
119:50 - about here it's a no
119:51 - sql structure inside of a database maybe
119:54 - watch some of the previous videos watch
119:55 - some of the builds you want you'll
119:56 - understand what's going on here but you
119:59 - can see docs.map
120:01 - and then we're going to say doc and then
120:04 - we're going to say it returns an
120:05 - object right and this object is going to
120:07 - have an id of doctor id
120:10 - and it's going to have the data inside
120:12 - of it as doc
120:13 - dot data now
120:18 - save it okay and it says use date is not
120:22 - defined
120:22 - so we need to go ahead and import use
120:24 - state save
120:26 - it there we go and now we should have
120:30 - chats being pulled in from the database
120:32 - right so here
120:33 - rather than having three hard-coded
120:35 - values what i'm going to say is i'm
120:36 - going to have chats.map and for every
120:38 - single chat what i want to do is i want
120:40 - to render out
120:42 - a sidebar chat boom
120:47 - okay i'm going to render out sidebar
120:48 - chat
120:49 - [Music]
120:52 - and there we go nice and then what i'm
120:54 - going to do is
120:55 - where we get the sidebar chat i'm going
120:56 - to destructure it right
120:58 - so remember we actually create an object
121:00 - here of id and data
121:02 - which means i'm going to go inside here
121:04 - destructure this
121:06 - and say this should have id data
121:10 - right inside of the data we're actually
121:12 - going to have a chat name
121:14 - and this will make sense in a second
121:16 - guys bear with me okay
121:18 - and this will all make sense right
121:22 - so so now what we're going to do is we
121:25 - have the sidebar chat okay
121:27 - so what we're going to have is i'm
121:29 - actually going to pass the id
121:31 - as the key i'm also going to say the
121:35 - id goes through as a prop and then i'm
121:38 - gonna pass a prop called the chat name
121:40 - through so we're gonna say chat name
121:41 - equals chat name
121:43 - and then inside of sidebar chat this
121:46 - will take some props
121:48 - and then the props we're going to
121:49 - destructure and say get id and chat name
121:53 - and then instead of saying channel name
121:55 - this one will now say
121:57 - chat name like that
122:01 - and that should be pretty good okay now
122:05 - here what you should see is it's empty
122:07 - right this is good
122:08 - now when i click this icon over here i
122:10 - want to do a little prompt that gets
122:12 - popped up right
122:13 - so how do we do that so i'm going to go
122:15 - ahead and go to the icon
122:17 - i'm going to say on click right i'm
122:19 - going to create a function called add
122:20 - chat
122:22 - right and then i'm going to go ahead and
122:24 - create the function here when i say add
122:25 - chat
122:25 - and this is an anonymous function and
122:28 - what we do here
122:29 - is i go ahead and say db
122:32 - dot collection chats
122:36 - and basically what it's going to do is
122:37 - it's going to go ahead and add
122:39 - a chat right and remember we added the
122:42 - chat name
122:43 - and basically what i'm going to do is
122:46 - we need to collect like a pop-up should
122:48 - come up so right now if you see in this
122:50 - one
122:50 - we have a pop-up that comes up all right
122:53 - so it says please enter a chat name
122:55 - now hey atharva says the background
122:57 - music and the light somehow sink and
122:59 - like fire that's sick dude thank you so
123:01 - much
123:01 - uh thank you thank melbourne for that
123:03 - everyone went ahead and bought me that
123:04 - stuff so
123:04 - amazing stuff um so all the asynchronous
123:07 - stuff and promises are handled by
123:08 - firebase right sonny
123:09 - yes so firebase handle a lot of the sort
123:12 - of back end headache and the sort of
123:13 - sockets and stuff like that
123:15 - so you don't actually need to worry
123:16 - about a lot of that headache when you're
123:18 - doing this right
123:19 - so here we're going to go ahead and say
123:21 - const
123:22 - chat name equals prompt right and this
123:26 - prompts the user for an input and what
123:28 - we're going to say is please
123:30 - enter a chat name
123:35 - all right please enter a chat name and
123:36 - then what we're going to say is if there
123:38 - was a chat name so we're going to kind
123:39 - of protect the user
123:40 - if there's a chat room then we'll do
123:42 - this database call
123:44 - right and then we're going to basically
123:45 - go ahead and say say it to the chat name
123:47 - now this will actually go ahead should
123:49 - do it for us so now if i go ahead and
123:51 - click
123:51 - let's go ahead and say youtube boom
123:55 - real time that was sick
123:58 - and it worked in the first try hey
124:02 - my best friend jay's in the house sunny
124:04 - on a solo react video got a smash that
124:06 - like for a solo run
124:07 - amen brother that's it we're doing well
124:09 - we've got quite a few
124:10 - viewers still on we've got 243 people
124:12 - across youtube
124:14 - and facebook right now absolutely
124:15 - smashing it and also dude
124:17 - i don't know if you can see the lights
124:18 - upgrade the cell it's looking good man
124:21 - um there you go so you see we've got
124:23 - that we've got youtube and let's just go
124:24 - ahead and type in something like
124:26 - apple fans or let's just say papa react
124:29 - papa react squad
124:32 - there we go boom oh man oh i kind of
124:35 - went off a bit
124:36 - but you know it's fine um it's going to
124:39 - be responsive up to a certain degree
124:41 - um so that looks pretty good okay and
124:43 - then what we're going to say
124:44 - is we are going to go down to
124:48 - the uh so we've done that bit now
124:53 - so what i want to also do is i want to
124:54 - protect this against
124:56 - a sort of scrolling issue so i'm going
124:58 - to go into my sidebar.css
125:00 - and for the sidebar chats so inside of
125:03 - here
125:03 - so i'm going to go into my cybor.css now
125:06 - for sidebar chats we've actually already
125:07 - added the overflow
125:08 - okay that's good so we will protect if
125:11 - we do this but it gets sort of
125:12 - spammed right so right now it's room
125:15 - based
125:16 - this chat is going to be room based and
125:17 - the reason why i donate room based is
125:19 - because it's going to be
125:20 - easier to uh go ahead and have you guys
125:23 - interact with each other
125:24 - okay now why is it not fetching the
125:26 - photo so if you know it's inside the
125:27 - actual build
125:28 - this is the last person who've sent the
125:30 - message so in this case it'll be kazi
125:32 - and then if i go ahead and say yo what's
125:35 - up guys
125:36 - notice how it'll be me and it'll say yo
125:38 - what's up guy with my last timestamp
125:40 - there you go see that that's why it
125:42 - hasn't done it just yet
125:43 - so we need to implement this part the
125:46 - messages
125:46 - and then i can go ahead and connect the
125:48 - last message right here
125:50 - okay so what we're going to do now is
125:52 - i'm going to have it so when i click
125:53 - on one of these rooms i go ahead and
125:56 - dispatch some information into
125:57 - the redux store about what channel we're
126:00 - in so in order to do that first i'm
126:02 - going to go into my features
126:03 - i'm going to actually going to add a
126:04 - whole nother slice of state
126:06 - so i'm going to copy and paste my user
126:08 - slice i'm going to rename it
126:10 - to chat slice okay so chatsize.js
126:14 - and then here what i'm going to say is
126:16 - i'm going to go ahead and
126:17 - change user slice all of this stuff to
126:21 - chat i'm going to go over here and
126:22 - double check so
126:25 - chat chat in the beginning this is not
126:27 - going to be this is going to be chat id
126:30 - and it's going to be chat name
126:33 - right and then it's going to be
126:37 - um we're going to go ahead and say set
126:40 - chat
126:40 - right right there's only going to be one
126:42 - action and this one
126:44 - we need to export it so we can use it
126:45 - outside
126:47 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
126:48 - when we get this action it's going to be
126:51 - state.chat
126:52 - id equals action.payload.chat id
126:56 - copy that line and i'm going to go ahead
126:58 - and refactor this to say chat name
127:02 - oh man i messed up i'll show you guys a
127:04 - quick trick come on d if i do chat name
127:06 - there we go
127:07 - boom save it uh oh to do that
127:10 - uh keyboard shortcut if you highlight a
127:13 - variable and you do command d
127:15 - you see it highlights all the possible
127:17 - ones when you get multiple cursors
127:19 - right so that's pretty sick and they'll
127:21 - allow you to be very fast with your
127:22 - coding
127:23 - now we have the set chat being exported
127:25 - so the next thing we want to do is
127:26 - actually go ahead and create selectors
127:28 - to pull that information so i'm going to
127:29 - make one called select chat name
127:31 - so select chat and the section i need
127:34 - just to select chat name
127:35 - and this goes into our state into the
127:38 - chat slice and it gets the chat name
127:40 - i'm going to copy and paste this and i'm
127:41 - going to go ahead and say select chat
127:43 - oops select chat id i'm going to go down
127:45 - here and say select chat id
127:47 - done right so this is looking pretty
127:50 - good
127:52 - right um so atharva says a man build
127:56 - with actual socket i o can also increase
127:58 - the possibilities and include
127:59 - functionality
127:59 - so you can do all of this dude with
128:01 - firebase so don't underestimate firebase
128:03 - um you can have all of that
128:07 - inside of firebase and it'll be a lot
128:08 - easier to build it um so you don't need
128:10 - to go ahead and
128:11 - like sort of overcomplicate by
128:13 - introducing one you you can introduce
128:14 - some ones that can do it that way
128:16 - and have like the skype functionality
128:17 - and things like that but you know
128:19 - only do what you kind of need to do
128:20 - unless at the point at which you need to
128:22 - do it
128:22 - so what i'm going to do is now connect
128:24 - this to the store
128:27 - so if i go into my store copy and paste
128:29 - there we go
128:30 - now we've got the user reducer right so
128:32 - here i'm going to change this to become
128:35 - so i'm going to change this oops i don't
128:38 - want to do that
128:39 - i'm going to go ahead and change this to
128:40 - become
128:43 - oh man overdone i'm going to go ahead
128:45 - and do user it's going to be the chat
128:47 - reducer
128:48 - and i'm going to copy paste and this one
128:51 - is going to be
128:53 - chat reducer
128:56 - chat reducer done right
128:59 - so loads of people saying why don't you
129:01 - upload react native tutorials because
129:03 - i'm literally dropping a react tutorial
129:04 - for you now dude
129:06 - i'm i'm trying to do as much as i can
129:08 - for you guys in terms of value based
129:10 - stuff
129:10 - also profit javascript is on fire right
129:12 - now we have a lot happening inside there
129:14 - so um yeah if you want to get the most
129:17 - from us make sure you subscribe make
129:18 - sure you hit the like button
129:19 - and just stay tuned we will be dropping
129:21 - as much content as you can possibly
129:23 - imagine
129:24 - so don't worry guys it's coming now to
129:26 - check that we've correctly linked up
129:27 - everything inside the db what i'm going
129:29 - to do is open up redux
129:31 - and we should see inside the state which
129:33 - is the user and we should see the new
129:34 - chat slice
129:35 - so if you get this you're pretty good at
129:37 - this point right
129:39 - so imran says hey sunny just amazing bro
129:41 - keep going appreciate that dude thank
129:43 - you so much
129:44 - um now what we're gonna do is for the i
129:46 - am a message so right now
129:48 - um i don't know why i'm not pulling the
129:50 - uh if i'll go ahead and say test
129:52 - uh oh yeah so right now actually if i go
129:55 - ahead and refresh you see it's not
129:56 - actually saving it because
129:58 - what we need to do is we need to go over
129:59 - here so if you actually go ahead and
130:01 - inspect and do the console i'll show you
130:03 - why
130:04 - because we haven't actually set up a
130:05 - firebase yet you see here you get this
130:07 - long
130:07 - could not reach for cloud firestore back
130:09 - end because we need to initialize it
130:11 - this is live right now it they said is
130:14 - this being premiered or live this is
130:15 - live
130:16 - cloud firestore we go here and then
130:18 - we're going to go ahead and say create
130:20 - database
130:20 - i'm going to start in test mode and i'm
130:22 - going to go ahead and click
130:24 - next i'm going to go ahead and do my
130:26 - about this
130:27 - enable this will go ahead and set up the
130:28 - firestore database
130:30 - so whoa man i'm not gonna read
130:33 - um holy
130:45 - okay right so
130:48 - now what we're gonna do is um
130:51 - so pedro to answer your question that's
130:53 - an arrow function the essex arrow
130:54 - function
130:55 - um same said just different syntax right
130:59 - right so so many people are saying at
131:01 - devtools is anything to see redux yes
131:03 - i literally just showed you guys so
131:05 - redux dev tools
131:07 - um you need to install the redux
131:08 - devtools but this is all redux
131:10 - right now this is relaxed actions this
131:11 - is redux state
131:13 - everything is redux yeah um
131:16 - thank you so much ronit he says oh nice
131:18 - my man that's freaking awesome really
131:19 - awesome content bro appreciate it thank
131:22 - you dude
131:22 - all right so now what i'm going to do is
131:24 - if we go ahead and add it in now so
131:26 - i'm just to visualize this for you guys
131:28 - i'm going to go ahead
131:29 - close this up and you guys are going to
131:31 - see now if i create a room and then i
131:32 - say like
131:33 - let's call it youtube enter and if i
131:37 - show you guys the firebase um so now i
131:40 - created a chat
131:41 - create the chat name youtube dope okay
131:43 - another one called
131:44 - cp team
131:46 - [Music]
131:48 - look at that you see in real time it
131:49 - created one called cp team
131:51 - right now if i was to go ahead and
131:52 - delete this one
131:54 - look on the right yeah in real time
131:58 - boom that's what you call snapshot
132:00 - that's the snapshot that's kicking in
132:02 - right so i'm going to go ahead and do
132:04 - another one so let's go ahead and say
132:06 - team cp because it sounds bad there we
132:08 - go created there boom
132:10 - but it's real time sync between the app
132:12 - and the back end
132:13 - so that's really powerful now we're
132:14 - gonna basically go ahead and create the
132:16 - messages
132:17 - okay so for the messages what we're to
132:19 - do is we're going to go to chat.js
132:20 - and here in chat.js right now we have
132:23 - everything hard coded okay
132:25 - so in order to fix this what i'm going
132:26 - to do is i'm going to go ahead and
132:28 - inside the messages i'm actually going
132:29 - to create a message component
132:31 - right so the message component so here
132:33 - i'm going to go ahead and get rid of
132:34 - these
132:35 - and for the message component i need to
132:37 - create a message
132:38 - component it's also message.js rfce
132:44 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
132:45 - import oops
132:47 - import message.css
132:53 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
132:55 - message.css
132:56 - so if darva says i love the realtime
132:57 - function i'll let you firebase because
132:59 - you don't need to refresh the client to
133:00 - make the changes visible
133:01 - exactly and that's very important
133:03 - imagine you had an app which is saying
133:05 - when your order is ready
133:06 - you need to be able to go ahead and do
133:07 - that right so that's going to be very
133:09 - important and that's what firebase
133:10 - pretty much fixes for you outside out of
133:12 - the box
133:13 - um so very very powerful stuff um
133:16 - okay so then we're gonna go ahead and
133:18 - say
133:19 - uh for the message so each message is
133:23 - gonna take a
133:24 - uh two parameters right it's gonna take
133:26 - contents and it's gonna take
133:28 - uh so i'm gonna destruction i'm gonna
133:30 - take an idm and contents
133:32 - right and then the message itself
133:35 - is gonna be it's gonna have an avatar
133:39 - all right so i'm gonna go ahead and say
133:40 - avatar
133:43 - auto import from react material ui and
133:45 - then we're going to have a p tag with
133:47 - the message inside of it so this is a
133:49 - message
133:52 - uh jay good question dude he goes why
133:54 - not use module.css you can separate css
133:56 - for each component
133:57 - very good question and yes what that
133:59 - does is it prevents you from having
134:00 - naming clashes
134:02 - but for now what i would say is when
134:04 - when people are learning and things like
134:05 - that so yes module.css is really good
134:08 - um bem is just very quick for when i'm
134:11 - building also there is a benefit to them
134:13 - for example like
134:14 - if i go into my login right and i
134:16 - basically say i'm new to the programming
134:18 - like new to whatever i'm coding
134:20 - if i do command shift f and i do this it
134:22 - will actually give me
134:23 - the exact location of that and then it
134:26 - will actually find it in the css whereas
134:28 - if i was using uh module.css it's kind
134:30 - of difficult but it's not difficult by
134:32 - it
134:33 - the truth is module.css is better yes
134:35 - but bem is a really good
134:37 - naming convention to to practice and it
134:39 - gets you very good at
134:41 - it basically breaks the bad habit of
134:43 - naming and then i would say progress to
134:45 - module.css
134:46 - so really really good um question bro uh
134:49 - aegis says let's go
134:50 - nice keep the energy high awesome stuff
134:54 - thank you i guess um right so this is a
134:57 - message
134:58 - and then we're gonna go ahead and create
134:59 - a small tag and here i'm gonna have a
135:02 - timestamp
135:03 - okay and then i'm gonna go back to my
135:05 - chat and then here i'm gonna import
135:08 - message from the top so there we go you
135:10 - can see this is a message right
135:12 - now i'm going to go ahead and paste this
135:14 - a few times we should have three
135:15 - messages popping out
135:17 - nice now inside the message i'm going to
135:19 - go ahead and pull out message.css
135:21 - i'm going to pull this underneath
135:25 - and then i'm going to go ahead and pull
135:27 - out my message
135:29 - so i can see here right now for the
135:30 - message i'm going to say dot message
135:37 - uh oh yeah some people had
135:41 - a comment them inside there inside the
135:43 - return block i remember that um
135:45 - display flex uh save it and everything
135:48 - goes into a row you don't see it because
135:50 - this needs to be class name
135:52 - message there we go
135:55 - and then i'm going to say align item
135:57 - center because it should go in the
135:59 - center
135:59 - i'll say position relative because we're
136:01 - going to do some absolute positioning
136:03 - inside of it
136:04 - with another component i'm going to say
136:06 - width should be fit
136:07 - content because we only want the bubble
136:09 - to be as big as it needs to be
136:10 - i say justify content space between
136:13 - because i want it to be sort of spaced
136:14 - out as much as it can be
136:16 - i'll say margin of 15 pixels so around
136:19 - remember
136:19 - margins outside the component uh padding
136:22 - is inside the component
136:24 - now the next thing okay
136:27 - the next thing we're going to do is
136:28 - we're going to say the message and then
136:30 - target the p
136:30 - tag inside right so the p tag inside
136:33 - there we go
136:34 - and i'm going to add a background color
136:35 - font size medium padding 15 pixels
136:37 - border radius 20 to get that rounded
136:39 - effect
136:40 - margin 10 pixels to add some more
136:41 - separation around the back around it
136:43 - and then a margin right pushes it all
136:45 - the way to the side okay for this one
136:48 - now what i'm also going to do is target
136:50 - that small tag
136:52 - i'm going to say go ahead and target
136:53 - small tag gray position absolute but
136:55 - because the parent is relative
136:57 - it actually goes ahead and stays
136:58 - relative to its parent and then it's
137:00 - bottom
137:01 - minus five and this goes ahead and adds
137:03 - a little timestamp like this
137:05 - so very clean right now
137:08 - what if i want to have it so that we
137:10 - have a sender as well so
137:11 - we'll figure out the sender afterwards
137:13 - so the blue message so
137:15 - if you send the message you want to be
137:17 - this side blue
137:18 - so i'm going to show you guys how to do
137:19 - that in just a bit but right now what
137:21 - i'm going to do is i'm going to have it
137:22 - so that when you enter
137:23 - it's actually going to go ahead and send
137:25 - a message into this right now
137:27 - okay so let's go ahead and do that first
137:28 - so the way we do that
137:30 - is firstly i need to have a keep track
137:32 - of all the messages coming in
137:34 - so inside of chat.js what i'm going to
137:36 - do is i'm going to say const messages
137:38 - set messages equals
137:42 - use state okay and then i'm going to do
137:45 - this
137:47 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
137:50 - um
137:54 - right so before we do this actually what
137:56 - we need to do
137:57 - is we need to fix a problem we need to
137:59 - fix one so i need to have it so when i
138:00 - click one of these
138:02 - it changes this to the channel right so
138:04 - if i click on the sidebar
138:06 - let's go to the sidebar dot js we have
138:08 - to solve this issue first so cyborg.js
138:10 - what i'm going to do now
138:11 - is have it so that when i click on the
138:14 - sidebar chat
138:15 - component so inside the sidebar chat
138:17 - component
138:20 - i should have it so when i click on that
138:22 - it goes ahead and dispatches an action
138:24 - so i'm going to show you guys how you
138:25 - can do this with an inline function
138:27 - so here i'm going to say on click
138:30 - i'm going to do an inline function and
138:32 - i'm going to say dispatch
138:35 - and i'm going to say dispatch and we'll
138:37 - do the imports and stuff afterwards i'm
138:38 - going to say set chat so this is a
138:40 - action that we
138:41 - set up earlier inside the app inside the
138:44 - chat slice
138:45 - and this will actually go ahead and take
138:47 - the chat id
138:49 - which is the id we passed in as a prop
138:51 - and it's also going to set the chat name
138:54 - as the chat name as a prop which came in
138:56 - as prop this means that we basically go
138:58 - ahead and set this up inside of our
139:00 - redux store so that way we can access it
139:02 - outside of any other
139:03 - place right so here i'm going to say
139:06 - const
139:08 - [Music]
139:11 - dispatch sorry
139:14 - dispatch
139:18 - equals use dispatch
139:21 - import it get rid of this boom
139:24 - um cesar says it's amazing how you know
139:27 - what you need to do step by step i
139:29 - understand how to do it myself with the
139:30 - project from scratch by scratch because
139:32 - i get lost by myself thank you sonny it
139:34 - just takes practice dude i remember in
139:35 - the beginning i used to be like freaking
139:37 - out and like panicking everywhere
139:38 - it just takes practice you'll get used
139:40 - to it honestly don't stress man
139:43 - uh just don't give up that's my main
139:44 - advice um
139:47 - i just broke something um
139:53 - line 13 oh yeah
139:56 - chat name boom
139:59 - boom
140:14 - all right one second guys we've got this
140:17 - we got this
140:20 - dispatch an object that's the end of the
140:23 - dispatch
140:24 - that's the end of this
140:28 - okay unexpected error
140:31 - god damn it there's always some kind of
140:33 - error when we when we do this stuff so
140:36 - let me go ahead and check something
140:37 - quickly the dispatch save it
140:39 - boom okay and then we've got the
140:41 - dispatch itself we've got the set chat
140:43 - we've got the id
140:46 - okay
140:49 - this is because of the following
141:03 - [Music]
141:09 - okay there we go and then i'm gonna say
141:11 - const dispatch
141:19 - equals use dispatch these brackets are
141:22 - ruining the show
141:23 - honestly dude yeah it's sometimes the
141:26 - bracket just piss me off man
141:27 - yeah so it comes dispatch there you go
141:31 - and then what i'm going to say is const
141:34 - chat info equals search envelope so this
141:37 - will be
141:38 - important for afterwards actually but
141:39 - we'll do that later so
141:41 - set chat is not defined line 13 this is
141:43 - because we need to go ahead and import
141:44 - this action
141:45 - we set that up earlier inside of our
141:47 - chat slice and redux and now
141:49 - what this should do is when i do this it
141:51 - will dispatch an action in redux
141:53 - so if i go down here you should see look
141:56 - so
141:57 - fresh piece of state so if i click team
141:59 - cp it goes ahead and sets the chat and
142:01 - it changes the chat name
142:03 - so remember by the way changes the chat
142:05 - name to team cp
142:06 - and chat id to the chat id right if i
142:08 - click on youtube
142:09 - it changes it so dispatch an action
142:11 - change the name to youtube
142:12 - and the chat id to the id that's based
142:15 - inside of firebase now that's very
142:17 - important
142:17 - because we're going to use that
142:18 - afterwards to go ahead and fetch the
142:20 - correct messages for this component
142:22 - so it's very it's very cleverly
142:23 - connected right
142:25 - so once that's done now what we can do
142:28 - is we can go ahead and actually pull
142:29 - that information in at the top
142:31 - right so we go ahead and go to our
142:34 - um let's go to uh
142:40 - chat.js and inside of chat.js now what i
142:43 - can do is i can use my selector so i can
142:45 - say go ahead and say chat name
142:47 - equals use selector i could say
142:50 - select chat name and i can pull this in
142:53 - and that's a special import so let's
142:55 - pull it in over there
142:57 - and then what we can say is rather than
142:59 - having channel name
143:00 - set over here i can actually go ahead
143:02 - and say channel
143:03 - name and now it says channel name is not
143:06 - the file oh sorry chat name
143:08 - chat name goddammit yeah somebody said
143:11 - yeah jay said you missed an open bracket
143:13 - yeah
143:13 - i know they found it in the end so now
143:15 - if we click youtube
143:16 - team tp hey see it changes at the top
143:19 - and we also have access to the id
143:21 - right so now what i'm going to have
143:24 - um awesome and
143:27 - you know foreign
143:30 - how did you manage programming fitness
143:33 - and lifestyle also dude
143:35 - ask nicely okay when you're at 22
143:38 - 25 uh 22 to 25 age
143:41 - um how do what you mean how did you
143:43 - manage you just do it man
143:45 - just do it stop complaining or finding
143:47 - excuses you literally just make it
143:49 - happen
143:50 - like if i don't really know the question
143:52 - like how did you manage to do that at
143:53 - that age
143:54 - like what's stopping you from doing it
143:55 - at that age that's what you need to kind
143:57 - of reset your
143:58 - your sort of mindset around it um
144:02 - okay so then what we're going to go
144:05 - ahead and do
144:06 - is have it load the appropriate messages
144:08 - right
144:09 - so this is going to take a two-step
144:11 - process so the first one
144:12 - is we go into our chat.js and we need to
144:14 - create a piece of state
144:15 - for the messages to keep track of what's
144:17 - going on so messages
144:19 - set messages okay and i'm going to say
144:21 - use
144:22 - state this is going to be an empty array
144:25 - um
144:27 - says how are you sunny i'm good dude how
144:29 - are you sorry if i pronounced the name
144:31 - wrong
144:32 - um yeah we're going to create a user
144:34 - fact
144:35 - all right i'm also going to get the chat
144:37 - id so i'm going to say const
144:38 - chat id equals use selector
144:43 - use selector and we'll say select
144:46 - chat id right
144:50 - right so now what i'm gonna do is
144:53 - i'm gonna go here and then i'm to go
144:55 - ahead and say
144:57 - so that's all working well now the chat
144:58 - id is there so now i'm going to go to
145:00 - the use effect
145:01 - and basically use effect again there's a
145:03 - piece of code that fires off
145:05 - once when the checkpoint loads and also
145:07 - whenever a dependency inside these
145:09 - square brackets changes for example in
145:10 - this case
145:11 - we need this to refresh every time the
145:13 - chat id changes because i'm going to
145:15 - need the chat id here so i'm going to
145:16 - say
145:17 - if a chat id was selected so
145:20 - we only get selects one when i click on
145:23 - one of these options then i would
145:24 - populate the store
145:25 - with a chat id when that happens i'm
145:28 - going to go ahead and say db
145:29 - dot collection db.collection
145:33 - i'm going to go inside of um
145:38 - hey tzuyler says i think i'm going to be
145:40 - on this channel from now on
145:41 - nice dude appreciate that so we're going
145:44 - to say db.collection
145:46 - chat and then we'll say doc and then the
145:49 - doc is going to be the chat id
145:51 - right so we're actually going to go into
145:53 - that chat and then we're going to say go
145:54 - into the collection inside of that chat
145:57 - and access the messages so essentially
145:59 - what we're doing is we're going inside
146:01 - the chat
146:02 - room so inside that inside this chat
146:04 - room
146:05 - we're going to go inside the collection
146:06 - of messages and then i'm going to say
146:09 - order by because we're actually going to
146:10 - set up a timestamp
146:12 - so i'll say order by a timestamp and
146:14 - then i'm going to say order by a
146:15 - descending timestamp
146:16 - so that'll be for a bit afterwards um
146:20 - jay says handling the chat and coding a
146:21 - goddamn imessage from scratch at the
146:23 - same time it's not an easy feat
146:25 - pure talent appreciate that dude and
146:27 - then what we're going to say is on
146:28 - snapshot right now snapshot is something
146:30 - that we do
146:31 - when we want to get a real-time feedback
146:32 - so if anything changes inside the db
146:35 - so we're going to use set messages so
146:37 - the hook and then we're going to go
146:38 - ahead and say snapshot.docs.map
146:41 - and then we're going to say doc right
146:42 - now for every single dock that comes
146:44 - back
146:44 - i'm going to map it to a object and this
146:47 - is going to map to the doc.id
146:50 - and also the data god's sake i hate that
146:52 - thing data
146:53 - dot dot data okay so i was like
146:56 - like that and what this is going to do
146:58 - is i know that might be a
146:59 - like a mouthful right here but what this
147:01 - is doing is it's basically when i click
147:03 - on this
147:04 - it's finding this inside the db this
147:07 - room
147:07 - all the collec the messages inside of
147:09 - collection there's grabbing them
147:11 - and storing them inside of the messages
147:13 - array okay
147:15 - um go back and sing says this is this is
147:17 - amazing attended it for the first time
147:19 - thank you so much dude
147:21 - um yeah glad you guys are enjoying this
147:23 - and again we're almost at 700 likes
147:28 - right jugutha says wow sunny is the best
147:32 - in react thanks i learned a lot from you
147:34 - appreciate that dude thank you so much
147:36 - for the kind words um
147:37 - let's keep on going strong okay so
147:41 - now what we're gonna do is we have the
147:43 - messages coming back right so
147:45 - here rather than having the messages
147:47 - hard-coded i'm gonna say for all of the
147:49 - messages
147:49 - go ahead and map through them and for
147:51 - each message i wanna render out an
147:53 - implicit return
147:55 - so an implicit message return and then
147:57 - we're going to go ahead and say
147:58 - render out a message and in that message
148:02 - should have a key
148:04 - with the id and here i'm going to
148:06 - destructure
148:09 - the what comes back for every message
148:11 - i'm going to get the id and the data
148:13 - and then we're going to pass in the
148:14 - contents of the message and that's going
148:17 - to be the data
148:18 - and the id is going to be the key okay
148:22 - and that will be that and then save it
148:25 - and now you should see if i click it
148:26 - that's pretty i know it doesn't look
148:28 - good
148:29 - but it is correct it's working trust me
148:31 - on that it's working
148:32 - right um you dating says i love you man
148:35 - you're great
148:36 - uh we have a sauron saying i love it
148:40 - sure up says um you're one of the best
148:42 - cheers of react after bad love from
148:43 - pakistan thank you so much dude
148:45 - um set messages and on snapchat in one
148:48 - command until now they were separate
148:50 - yeah
148:50 - it's really really powerful to write
148:52 - like that right so the next thing we're
148:54 - going to do now is this is actually sort
148:56 - of when i click this it's going ahead
148:57 - and fetching it
148:58 - right so it's fetching the messages but
149:00 - we need a way to push messages inside
149:02 - right now so
149:03 - i'm going to go ahead and do that as
149:04 - well so right now earlier we set up the
149:06 - input map
149:08 - we mapped the input sort of piece of
149:09 - state to our input field over here
149:11 - and then we had it map on the on change
149:13 - so as i type in down here
149:15 - pretty much goes ahead and stores it
149:16 - inside of our local state now when we we
149:18 - create a send message
149:20 - we said e dot prevent default to prevent
149:22 - the refreshing from happening
149:24 - and then we said firebase magic so this
149:25 - is where the firebase magic happens
149:27 - right
149:27 - so i'm gonna go ahead and say
149:28 - db.collection i'm gonna go back into the
149:31 - chats
149:32 - right the collection of chats i'm gonna
149:34 - go into the doc dock and the dock here
149:36 - is gonna be the chat id
149:38 - and then i'm gonna say go into the
149:40 - collection
149:42 - of messages
149:45 - all right and then what i'm gonna say is
149:48 - add
149:50 - right so go into connection messages and
149:52 - then i'm going to say add
149:53 - and at this point what we do is we
149:55 - pretty much go ahead and add what we
149:56 - need so we're going to add a timestamp
149:58 - now the timestamp is going to be
150:00 - different for everyone for example if
150:01 - you're in india or if you're in la
150:03 - if you're in new york your timestamps
150:05 - can be different to me in london
150:06 - so what i need to do is i need to go
150:07 - ahead to the top and say import firebase
150:09 - from firebase
150:11 - okay so import firebase from firebase
150:12 - not the local one the actual firebase
150:15 - and here i'm going to say firebase.first
150:18 - right which is a function i'm going to
150:20 - say field value no window function so
150:22 - we're going to say field value
150:24 - and then i'm going to say server
150:28 - server timestamp and that's a function
150:31 - this will go ahead and give
150:32 - me the time of the actual server so that
150:34 - way
150:35 - even if you sent it based in london even
150:37 - if you sent this
150:38 - and um hey ismail saying london baby
150:40 - thanks for doing this on a friday night
150:42 - it's a good way to end your friday night
150:44 - nice guys
150:45 - awesome stuff um bala ganesh says thank
150:48 - you so much
150:49 - um for providing the valuable
150:51 - information keep inspiring and
150:53 - motivating us thank you so much dude
150:55 - um messed up the camera a little bit
150:56 - there um but then we've got the time
150:58 - stamp so
150:59 - regardless of where you're based in um
151:04 - nice he says dude i see you in the
151:06 - projects more than anything else during
151:07 - my day i don't give up do you know
151:09 - already what the next project will be
151:10 - react nate have a bunch of stuff
151:12 - happening we've got loads of stuff
151:13 - coming guys just keep
151:14 - subscribed and keep an eye on my
151:16 - instagram go ahead and follow me
151:17 - uh over here if you're not following me
151:19 - to keep track of when we drop the latest
151:21 - and greatest videos
151:22 - okay so message here i'm gonna say input
151:26 - and then i'm also to give uid and this
151:28 - one is going to be
151:29 - user so again and now i need the user's
151:32 - information so
151:33 - the message contents are going to be
151:35 - here we're going to pull that from the
151:36 - input okay
151:37 - but i need the user who actually sent
151:39 - the message so in order to do that
151:41 - i'm going to get the user i'm going to
151:43 - say select
151:44 - use selector sorry use selector
151:47 - and then i'm going to say select user so
151:50 - this is my select user
151:52 - and then i'm going to go ahead and make
151:53 - sure this is import okay we've already
151:54 - imported it um
151:57 - so soham thank you so much for the kind
151:59 - words bonjour attacks enjoying it nice
152:01 - stuff guys
152:02 - um so i'm gonna go ahead and save that
152:08 - and then what we're gonna do is
152:13 - we're gonna go ahead and have it so that
152:16 - it pushes
152:17 - the um we've got the message here but
152:20 - i've also wanted a bunch of other things
152:21 - i want the uid
152:22 - the photo the email the display name all
152:24 - from the user item
152:25 - right so what i do is i go uid equals
152:28 - user.uid so remember when you log in
152:30 - we populate the user inside the redux
152:32 - store we just use the selector to go
152:34 - ahead and grab it from the redux store
152:36 - which gives us the user object and
152:37 - that's how we go ahead and get the user
152:39 - that we're going to push in
152:40 - for every single object that also gives
152:42 - us the photo
152:43 - okay now borax says you're like a
152:45 - magician
152:46 - thank you dude appreciate it um
152:48 - [Music]
152:50 - good positivity right um
152:53 - i love this because i don't find it
152:55 - coincidence on my motivation i've just
152:56 - told me don't give up on something you
152:58 - can't stop thinking about every single
152:59 - day
153:00 - exactly exactly keep doing what you love
153:04 - right so that with that said now what we
153:07 - actually have is a really nice
153:09 - really nice system which should be
153:10 - working okay so let's go ahead and check
153:12 - it out
153:12 - so firstly i'm also going to go ahead
153:14 - and update the message
153:15 - itself before we do that so everything
153:18 - should come in clutch
153:19 - and work together right so first thing
153:21 - i'm going to do is the contents actually
153:22 - have a bunch of things inside of it
153:24 - so uh my girlfriend is obsessed with
153:26 - proper react do you know do you guys
153:28 - know who papa react is who the heck is
153:29 - proper react
153:30 - hey i love her honestly and she goes i
153:34 - miss him she guys
153:35 - she misses out on time with me for these
153:36 - streams so smash the thumbs up button
153:38 - right and uh and show some love and
153:40 - support for that all right
153:42 - so over here i'm going to say content
153:44 - i'm going to destructure right
153:46 - jay goes oh the og arrives this is where
153:49 - it comes up
153:50 - um she goes guys show some love he's
153:53 - doing so well let's tap that like button
153:54 - guys we're at 660 likes
153:56 - can we get to 700 i think so i think so
154:00 - right um so now i'm gonna go ahead and
154:03 - destructure the contents right so over
154:05 - here
154:05 - i'm gonna say timestamp when i say
154:08 - display name
154:10 - i'm gonna say email so i'm breaking it
154:12 - apart the object right now i'm gonna say
154:14 - message photo and uid
154:17 - right uid save it and then it says line
154:20 - seven is an error no what do i do
154:24 - yeah i need to close this and then
154:27 - oh what the hell happened here so
154:30 - we've got this boom boom
154:34 - there we go all right
154:37 - um i think we can get to 700 likes i
154:39 - think we can
154:40 - uh petition to get marvin next to
154:43 - sunny's
154:44 - uh in the next video a hundred percent i
154:47 - think we can get that one in this video
154:48 - i'll teach you how to code guys we can
154:49 - do that
154:50 - right um and that'll be awesome
154:54 - uh and the one here is actually papa and
154:56 - no
154:57 - we don't talk about angular here guys we
154:59 - hate that
155:01 - all right so uh yes papa and mama
155:04 - together yeah she's gonna be mama react
155:06 - guys
155:06 - so get her on the channel early we're
155:09 - actually gonna have a we're actually
155:10 - thinking of starting a youtube channel
155:11 - together so that would be fun
155:13 - um right now guys with that said now the
155:16 - avatar the source
155:17 - for the avatar is actually going to be
155:19 - the photo that comes through right so
155:21 - the photo that we destruction
155:23 - uh there we go um
155:26 - so inspiring man love from bangladesh by
155:28 - the way where are you from sunny
155:29 - london dude based and born in london
155:32 - right now for the p tag i'm gonna say
155:34 - this is a message rather than that one
155:36 - actually dropped a dynamic message just
155:38 - being pulled in
155:39 - um then we're gonna go ahead and say
155:43 - uh timestamp so for the timestamp you
155:45 - need to do some clever passing right so
155:46 - i'm gonna go ahead and drop a snippet in
155:48 - here
155:48 - and i'll explain what it does it says
155:50 - create a new date from the timestamp
155:51 - optional training protects it against
155:53 - because there are times where it's
155:54 - asynchronous
155:55 - and it's pretty much gonna have a uh
155:57 - it's gonna have an undefined value so
155:59 - you protect yourself with optional
156:00 - training
156:01 - you say pass it to a date and then
156:02 - you're gonna basically go ahead and
156:03 - format it to a locale string
156:06 - uh so we can go ahead and save that and
156:08 - i know it seems like oh my god he's
156:10 - doing so much but it will make
156:11 - sense in a second right
156:13 - uh bonjour tech says you guys are great
156:14 - colors and are great humans nice family
156:17 - appreciate that dude thank you so much
156:19 - um
156:21 - this would be dope next video teaching
156:24 - about coding and how to go by damn
156:25 - wouldn't that be fun more like melbourne
156:27 - bar
156:27 - going code and learn with me react from
156:29 - papa wrap from scratch so basically
156:30 - teaching up from scratch yeah
156:32 - i think that'll be fun honestly um rzo
156:35 - says you are the best program in the
156:36 - world thanks brother for this helpful
156:37 - information i appreciate that dude
156:39 - um i'm glad you're enjoying the stream
156:41 - all right so now what we're going to do
156:43 - is we're actually going to go ahead and
156:45 - have the email so
156:47 - uh the final piece right here so i'm
156:49 - going to actually go ahead and say
156:50 - we're going to test it right now right
156:52 - so if we if this works
156:54 - right this is where it gets tense right
156:57 - if this works right so i haven't
156:59 - actually gone ahead and sort of checked
157:01 - everything out but if this next bit
157:03 - works
157:03 - i want everyone to smash the thumbs up
157:06 - button and get this video to 700 likes
157:08 - all right
157:09 - so i think what we need to do is uh we
157:12 - need to go ahead and get ready for this
157:13 - right because i'm gonna pretty much i
157:14 - haven't tested this
157:15 - i'm just gonna go ahead and see if it
157:16 - works in one go we change so much code
157:18 - right now
157:19 - and i think it's gonna work right i
157:22 - think it's gonna work but
157:23 - you know how these things happen all
157:25 - right so i'm gonna go to message
157:27 - i'm signed in right and then we're gonna
157:30 - go ahead and say
157:31 - yo this works
157:34 - you think dot dot dot all right so
157:36 - suspense right
157:38 - everything's gonna happen as soon as i
157:39 - hit enter on this is it gonna work
157:42 - right all right
157:47 - see how it goes albiola says the best
157:50 - programmer i have ever seen
157:52 - jay goes let's go ottawa's already
157:54 - coming in with the suspense music
157:56 - right i think we can do it i'm going to
157:59 - hit enter
158:01 - and we can see if it's going to work
158:04 - hey
158:05 - [Music]
158:07 - see what
158:10 - and look at that guys it pulled my
158:12 - picture in
158:14 - and it pulled the message in even has a
158:16 - correct time stamp
158:18 - right so that's pretty sick right
158:20 - everything works like that
158:22 - and now if i go ahead and just say like
158:24 - abc one two three
158:26 - that's that boom works nice right so
158:29 - that's though
158:30 - we've got everything working i think we
158:32 - should all go ahead and hit that thumbs
158:34 - up if you haven't already
158:35 - alright again i think we're gonna hit
158:36 - 700 very soon so that's
158:38 - dope guys now what we're gonna do is
158:41 - actually have it so that if you're the
158:42 - sender
158:44 - then it's gonna go ahead and make it
158:45 - that blue message so it's gonna be like
158:47 - this
158:47 - right if you're the sender it's gonna
158:49 - show you a blue message
158:50 - um so we're gonna go ahead and do that
158:54 - right now so inside of
158:55 - message dot css i'm going to go ahead
158:59 - and add the following logic so right now
159:01 - we have message over here so i'm going
159:02 - to create this into
159:04 - a more i'm going to do string
159:06 - interpolation here
159:07 - i'm going to say if the user.email
159:12 - so i need to go ahead and actually pull
159:13 - the user in so i need to say const
159:15 - user equals use selector
159:22 - select user all right
159:29 - um yeah yeah
159:32 - and then what we're going to say now is
159:34 - we're going to say user if the user's
159:36 - email
159:37 - is equal to the email address that comes
159:40 - in
159:41 - i change it to the other music because
159:42 - it's easier to focus with that one all
159:44 - right
159:44 - then we're going to go ahead and have uh
159:47 - yeah so this is
159:48 - no the question mark is if else
159:52 - that's if else what we're about to use
159:54 - right now but the question mark down
159:55 - here
159:56 - um is actually saying optional chaining
159:58 - so if this for any reason is undefined
160:01 - it doesn't crash the program it just
160:03 - handles it uh elegantly
160:05 - so it's coming something called optional
160:06 - chaining very very elegant solution to
160:08 - use
160:09 - um but here what we're going to do is
160:10 - we're actually using we're using tannery
160:12 - here
160:12 - so actually we're not going to use
160:13 - tennis we're going to use a direct right
160:15 - but with the ternary you can say if it's
160:17 - true
160:17 - then say this else say this
160:21 - right so that's the ternary but what
160:23 - we're going to do is we're going to do a
160:24 - direct sort of
160:25 - conditional so we're going to say here
160:28 - apply the message
160:31 - sender class if the user's email is
160:34 - equal to the email of the message right
160:36 - go ahead and save that
160:38 - and let's go ahead and refresh some
160:41 - reason that's not refreshing there we go
160:42 - and now if i go ahead and click into
160:44 - this for example the youtube chat it
160:46 - loads up the youtube message and if i go
160:47 - ahead and say
160:48 - this is a test now you guys can also see
160:50 - if i go into different channels it pulls
160:52 - those messages
160:54 - which is dope right so let's go into
160:57 - message.css hey we got ecuador in the
161:01 - house nice
161:02 - sup dude and then here what we're gonna
161:05 - say
161:06 - is i'm gonna add a few style tricks in
161:08 - so what i'm gonna first say
161:09 - is that if the message sender if the
161:11 - message
161:13 - sender class exists set the margin all
161:16 - the way to the right
161:18 - right then what we're going to say is
161:21 - that if the message sender
161:23 - is existing what i'm going to do is i'm
161:25 - going to target the message photo and
161:27 - i'm going to use a rule called order one
161:29 - and this is basically going to change
161:30 - the flex
161:31 - order of the children so the image will
161:34 - now go
161:35 - ahead of the child so in this case if i
161:38 - do that
161:39 - and i say message photo by default is
161:42 - message is order zero
161:44 - what this will do is
161:48 - if we want to get this effect right so
161:50 - we have the message on this side
161:52 - and the message on here so the way we do
161:54 - that is i can refresh
161:56 - we actually haven't set something up
161:57 - correctly here so
161:59 - we've got the message sender then we
162:02 - need to do
162:03 - a message photo because inside of here i
162:07 - haven't done a class name
162:09 - of message
162:12 - photo now if we do that and refresh
162:17 - boom works there we go
162:20 - all right so now it's the sender and
162:22 - also i'm going to change the color of
162:24 - the
162:24 - message sender so i'm going to go ahead
162:27 - and do this
162:28 - oh we almost we're 10 likes away from
162:30 - 700 likes guys let's go come on we can
162:32 - do this
162:33 - right so we're going to go ahead and
162:34 - target the message sender p tag and
162:36 - we're going to say if you're a sender
162:37 - then it
162:38 - turns blue so now it does this right so
162:41 - i'm going to test this i'm going to log
162:42 - out of my account go into sign in
162:44 - and i'm going to go ahead and check now
162:46 - i'm going to go into qazi's account and
162:48 - let's go ahead and see
162:50 - and if i go here now so that now i'm not
162:52 - the sender because it's not kazzy's
162:53 - email address but if i go into
162:55 - here and i say like what's up guys
163:00 - enter boom so now the sender is going to
163:03 - get the blue message but
163:04 - somebody else is going to have not have
163:06 - it right 5 legs away
163:08 - let's go um dope right so that works
163:11 - really good
163:12 - okay now the next step and the final
163:14 - step
163:15 - is actually going ahead and adding two
163:17 - things one adding the animations which
163:19 - will be very quick
163:20 - and two uh i thought because if we do
163:23 - not have seven hundred maybe
163:24 - we'll attack sunny goddammit help me out
163:26 - guys get four more likes and get hashtag
163:28 - fancy dinner going
163:29 - you know um so what we're gonna do now
163:32 - is also have
163:33 - the message come up here right inside
163:35 - our chat so in order to do that
163:37 - what we need to do is go into our
163:39 - sidebar chat
163:41 - and we have the um
163:45 - i need to create a piece of state and
163:47 - this is going to be the information that
163:48 - we're going to show here so i'm gonna
163:50 - call it
163:50 - uh chat info okay so i need to go ahead
163:52 - and import this
163:54 - um and there we go and then what i'm
163:57 - gonna go ahead and do is

167:35 - ahead and do this so i'm going to
167:36 - include
167:38 - some i'm going to say new chat info 0
167:41 - timestamp
167:42 - today and then we're going to pass it
167:44 - now you can see guys look at this
167:45 - if i go ahead and change it to like one
167:47 - two three boom
167:49 - one two three has the latest time stamp
167:52 - and and then the one thing we need to
167:53 - fix is the avatar right so the source
167:55 - for the avatar
167:56 - i'm going to go ahead and do the same
167:57 - thing i'm going to say here it's going
167:59 - to be chat info 0
168:00 - and we're doing optional change to
168:02 - protect against the break
168:04 - and then now we should see
168:08 - so kazi was the last one that sent the
168:10 - message here and then i was the last one
168:12 - that sent a message here which is why my
168:13 - picture but if i say
168:15 - yo i'm taking over i'm taking over the
168:18 - sidebar
168:19 - boom there you go nice cause it's richer
168:22 - all right so that's dope that's amazing
168:25 - it's working as we want it right
168:27 - so what we're gonna do now is have some
168:28 - fancy animations in so the way we can do
168:31 - that
168:31 - is um uh somebody says so something can
168:35 - you pause the music when you do live
168:36 - streams it kind of kills about i
168:37 - i really i don't know man i really enjoy
168:39 - the vibe uh the the music and i think
168:41 - loads of people actually enjoy the music
168:43 - so
168:43 - i kind of go based off of what
168:45 - everyone's enjoying what everyone's
168:46 - feeling you know
168:47 - that sort of stuff um
168:50 - my girlfriend just texted me saying they
168:51 - want me in the vid hell yeah we're gonna
168:53 - bring you in the vid
168:54 - um so now what we're to do is we're
168:57 - going to go ahead and actually add the
168:59 - animations in so you can see
169:01 - right now um so right now see
169:05 - this is the final finishing touch this
169:07 - nice little animation right here okay
169:09 - amazing donation thank you so much
169:11 - shashank he says what cp doing is
169:12 - amazing thank you guys
169:14 - thank you so much brother for that
169:15 - donation i appreciate you
169:17 - also if i go ahead and type in here say
169:18 - hello you see that it kind of pops in in
169:21 - a very nice animated fashion so in order
169:23 - to do that
169:25 - what we're gonna do now is yeah so these
169:27 - t spoilers like no
169:28 - don't don't kill the music i say i'm
169:30 - gonna kill it dude don't worry
169:31 - uh so i'm gonna add something called
169:33 - react flip move so i'm gonna go ahead
169:34 - and say react flip move
169:36 - and i'm gonna go here to effortless
169:38 - animation and i'm going to show you guys
169:39 - how to implement
169:40 - very easy animations right so we need to
169:42 - go ahead and install it
169:44 - so i'm going to go in to bring up the
169:45 - terminology npm i react flip move
169:48 - um you don't need the dash s anymore and
169:51 - then what i'm going to say
169:52 - is we're going to go down here and you
169:53 - see there's a good documentation for
169:55 - this
169:55 - but all we need to do essentially is add
169:57 - a forward ref
169:58 - to our message that's the first thing so
170:00 - i'm going to go to my message
170:02 - and i'm going to change this function to
170:04 - an es6 function first i'm going to say
170:06 - const message
170:07 - equals and i'm changing this to an arrow
170:09 - function so it's the same thing but it's
170:11 - just written in the es6 way so this is
170:13 - the es6
170:14 - way of writing a function okay and then
170:17 - what we're going to do is
170:19 - here's his mouth says play some 690 can
170:21 - you imagine trying to
170:23 - go to that that'd be tricky man all
170:25 - right so i'm going to go ahead and add
170:27 - forward ref
170:27 - and then i'm going to go ahead and do
170:29 - parentheses go all the way down here and
170:31 - add the closing parenthesis
170:33 - and then you've got the after the
170:36 - destructuring i'm going to do comma
170:38 - and i'm going to pull a ref out of it
170:40 - right
170:41 - and then what what that means is we pull
170:43 - the ref away
170:44 - from this bit and then we go into our
170:47 - div
170:48 - and we basically say ref equals ref now
170:50 - as for what this does you don't need to
170:52 - say i'm going to explain what forward
170:53 - ref
170:53 - is at this point but you need to import
170:55 - it um
170:57 - this is pretty much gonna it's gonna
170:59 - allow your your sort of
171:00 - just think of it this way it's gonna
171:01 - allow your functional components to be
171:03 - able to communicate
171:04 - the way that they need to for the
171:05 - animation to play correctly okay
171:07 - that's all we need to know at this point
171:09 - so that's successfully installed uh we
171:11 - don't need that anyway
171:13 - then we're gonna go back to our chat.js
171:15 - and where we render out the messages
171:17 - all we need to do is wrap this entire
171:19 - div inside of
171:20 - the flip move so flip move
171:27 - component because now we've done that
171:29 - correctly so it's going to freak out and
171:32 - i'm going to go back here and you see
171:34 - it's saying right flip move is not fine
171:36 - so i need to import react flip move
171:40 - react flip move i'm going to go ahead
171:42 - and import that react flip move from
171:44 - react flip move
171:45 - and now guys check this out
171:48 - boom animations you need keys
171:52 - though you need keys in your messages
171:53 - otherwise it messes this entire thing up
171:56 - it doesn't know which is what then but
171:57 - now if i go inside and say hello
171:59 - boom check that out guys yo it works
172:03 - look how smooth that is
172:05 - that's dope i just want to check if my
172:07 - overflow is fixed
172:09 - so i'm just going to do say abc and i'm
172:11 - going to copy this a bunch of times
172:12 - let's do abc oh okay i guess we could do
172:15 - an important reaction
172:15 - move from here okay so you see this
172:17 - right now it breaks
172:19 - right there's no see overflow doesn't it
172:21 - doesn't work correctly right
172:23 - we don't want this to happen okay so how
172:26 - do we fix this overflow issue
172:28 - right so let's go ahead and fix this so
172:30 - let's go ahead and go to
172:32 - our chat.css and here what we want to do
172:36 - so inside of chat.css
172:40 - where we have chat messages i'm going to
172:42 - go ahead and firstly add overflow
172:44 - scroll okay now by adding that
172:47 - you can see we have actually already
172:49 - fixed a lot of the issue
172:51 - but i want to kind of hide the scroll
172:52 - bars right so in order to do that now
172:55 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to add
172:56 - these two snippets we've seen them
172:57 - before i'm reusing them here
172:59 - so these two the first one does it for
173:00 - chrome safari and oprah the second one
173:02 - does it for internet explorer edge and
173:03 - firefox
173:04 - um but it basically removes the look and
173:07 - feel so if i go ahead and save it
173:09 - it removes the look and feel but it
173:11 - actually keeps the functionality
173:12 - of the scroll bar okay so that's dope
173:15 - and it works really really nice really
173:17 - really well so
173:19 - with that said now what we're going to
173:20 - go ahead and do is
173:23 - um
173:26 - so if you want to go ahead and make it
173:27 - to time ago i would recommend this go
173:30 - ahead and extend on it but you can
173:31 - pretty much use the
173:32 - moment or time ago library um that's
173:35 - going to be something pretty cool
173:37 - um we can actually go ahead and just
173:38 - check quickly i think it's time ago
173:40 - uh jess just
173:43 - moment you get loads you get time ago.js
173:46 - this one's pretty decent i've used this
173:48 - one before um
173:50 - see you see this is just now four
173:52 - minutes ago things like that
173:54 - um should we just quickly do let's just
173:57 - do it go on then
173:58 - let's do it i'm gonna do npm install
174:02 - timeago.js
174:03 - and then let's go ahead and see how you
174:05 - can do it so
174:06 - import all as time ago and then let's go
174:10 - ahead and check out how we use it so i
174:11 - haven't used this in a while so it'll be
174:12 - interesting
174:13 - so sidebar
174:17 - sidebar chat
174:20 - and then we have where we have the
174:23 - timestamps over here
174:24 - what i'm going to do is
174:27 - i'm going to go ahead and say import at
174:29 - the top
174:31 - import all from time ago at some time
174:33 - ago suggest you can also do a moment i
174:35 - think so i'm just using
174:36 - the quick one that i saw but you can do
174:38 - it moment moments really good one two at
174:40 - some moment
174:41 - that's what we're gonna do time ago um
174:43 - dot
174:44 - format oops i'm gonna format
174:48 - i'm gonna basically pop this in now i'm
174:50 - not sure if that will work
174:51 - just like that pretty much go ahead and
174:53 - see so look at that four weeks ago okay
174:55 - that's not right
174:56 - um it hasn't done that right so if i go
174:59 - to to
175:00 - locale string let's go ahead and see if
175:02 - this one works
175:03 - oh there we go nice look at that two
175:05 - minutes ago
175:06 - if i go ahead and say yo boom just now
175:10 - fast though dude that's sick
175:14 - we got that working pretty quick and now
175:16 - this one says six minutes ago
175:17 - if i go ahead and said uh when was this
175:21 - pushed just now
175:24 - right and that's sick and that would
175:26 - change um
175:28 - as and when sort of like the timings
175:30 - change and things like that
175:31 - um i think uh moment is actually a lot
175:34 - better
175:34 - i think i would use a moment um
175:37 - but yeah you can pretty much use
175:39 - whatever you decide to do because you
175:40 - see now this one doesn't actually
175:41 - refresh
175:43 - in real time but i mean it's not bad
175:44 - like isn't this actually not bad like
175:46 - um but i would like the one that does
175:48 - dynamics so i would actually go
175:49 - recommend
175:50 - uh time ago moment.js
175:54 - moment.js i think i prefer moment.js um
175:59 - they have a much better way of doing it
176:02 - at a moment.js so i think it's
176:05 - from now yeah you see from now is the
176:08 - one that i would have used
176:09 - preferably but it's fine yeah um
176:13 - so yeah so this one the reason why i've
176:14 - done this guys and had it reversed like
176:17 - this
176:17 - is because you need to have a listener
176:19 - then which scrolls to the bottom always
176:21 - so i'm not going to do that today
176:22 - otherwise it's just a little bit
176:23 - unnecessary extra work i want to show
176:25 - you the deployment instead so we can
176:26 - prioritize that
176:27 - right what i would say is you can pretty
176:29 - much go ahead and just
176:30 - if you want to do that you go to chat.js
176:33 - and you literally just change it to
176:35 - um ascending firstly and then you have
176:38 - it so that
176:39 - you always have a scroll listener
176:42 - so every time the user sends a message
176:45 - it will scroll to the bottom
176:47 - as that way it kind of locks to the
176:48 - bottom every time you send a message
176:49 - that's what that's how you do that by
176:51 - the way
176:52 - um so yeah um so now what we're going to
176:55 - do
176:56 - is i'm going to go ahead and say
176:57 - firebase init right
176:59 - so in order to do this you need to have
177:01 - firebase setup so firebase tools so you
177:02 - might need to globally install firebase
177:04 - tools
177:04 - but what i'm going to do now is go ahead
177:06 - and do firebase init and i'm going to
177:08 - spacebar on hosting and then i'm going
177:10 - to use an existing project
177:12 - right so i'm going to go ahead and find
177:14 - the build that i've done so you see
177:15 - we have so many builds and imessage
177:17 - clone youtube
177:18 - hit that and what then what you want to
177:20 - go ahead and do is go ahead and do oops
177:23 - go ahead and do
177:24 - public directory i'm going to say build
177:26 - right so not you don't care enter you
177:28 - has to be
177:29 - build all right build is very important
177:31 - here and then once we do this we're
177:32 - going to click
177:32 - y because it's a single page app every
177:35 - react app is a single page app
177:37 - then what we need to do is say npm run
177:39 - build so now we're going to deploy this
177:40 - live right so npm run build
177:42 - and then i'm going to basically go ahead
177:44 - so that's good if i run that it
177:45 - basically creates an optimized
177:47 - production build
177:48 - okay optimize production build and that
177:51 - will go ahead and make it very very fast
177:53 - and sort of and it'll be very very nice
177:55 - and easy to go ahead and do that
177:57 - so um optimized production build is
178:00 - gonna get so it strips out all the
178:02 - things that dev devtools the things that
178:03 - you don't need
178:04 - on the deployed version of the website
178:09 - that's what happens when you when you
178:10 - use this okay so you need to go ahead
178:12 - and do this and now it's important to
178:13 - know whenever you do npm run build if
178:15 - you make any changes
178:16 - after you're gonna need to go ahead and
178:18 - do npm run build again to get the
178:19 - optimized build
178:20 - now checking inside of our build folder
178:23 - so as we now
178:24 - should see a build photo with all the
178:26 - stuff inside of it you don't want to
178:27 - ever touch the build folder
178:29 - the command line builds everything for
178:30 - you and puts it inside of that
178:32 - but what we want to do now is say
178:34 - firebase
178:35 - deploy if it's not a single page we can
178:38 - use hash router and deploy you don't
178:39 - even need to use that you can just react
178:41 - router
178:41 - to make it multiple pages so a lot of
178:43 - the builds including the amazon clone on
178:45 - the react
178:46 - challenge if you use a react route or
178:48 - inside that we use reactor inside that
178:49 - build to
178:50 - have multiple pages inside the app that
178:52 - will do it
178:53 - but here you can say firebase deploy and
178:56 - guys
178:56 - who is ready to deploy this thing if
178:58 - you're ready let me know
179:00 - uh we've pretty much got this thing
179:01 - built but i want to go ahead and have
179:03 - everyone jump on this app
179:05 - and get this thing deployed and up and
179:08 - running so let me know in the comments
179:09 - if you are
179:10 - excited and if you are and you haven't
179:13 - already done so
179:14 - smash the thumbs up on button and let me
179:16 - know if i should hit this deployment
179:17 - button
179:18 - okay so let me know right now my finger
179:20 - is here right all i have to do is let
179:22 - you just drop
179:23 - and we can pretty much go ahead and
179:24 - deploy this thing
179:26 - live and it's so fast i'm going to drop
179:28 - that in the chat and everyone's going to
179:29 - go ahead and be able to use this
179:32 - and go ahead and see the real-time
179:34 - functionality of this right
179:35 - so we have a miracle says let's go uh
179:38 - jay says get that fire build online so
179:40 - we can experience it pranav says ready
179:42 - for sure
179:43 - everyone is ready bonjour says uh pumped
179:47 - super ready and pumped let's go ahead
179:49 - and do it uh
179:50 - daniel graham is saying push that button
179:52 - let's go ahead and do it guys
179:54 - i'm gonna go ahead and hit the enter key
179:57 - and you can see it's pretty much going
179:59 - to go ahead and spin it up so it's
180:00 - deploying hosting
180:02 - and as soon as that's done it's
180:03 - uploading the new files and see how long
180:05 - it takes
180:06 - and hey

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys welcome to another build on the channel we are excited today you're here with your boy papa react aka sonny what's up guys good to see everyone again and today i'm gonna be dropping some fire for you guys so everyone has requested chat apps and things like that so today i went ahead i listened to you guys and i'm building the imessage clone so this is gonna be fun if you're excited for this smash the thumbs up button get this video out to as many people as we possibly can and it's gonna be a good time so make sure you got your coffee i got my water ready and i'm about to demo this app to you guys let me know what you guys are watching from me know where you guys are from let's get the energy up and we can go ahead and smash it in today's build let's go ahead and give a quick demo as to what we're building today so right now you can see this is the imessage clones let's go ahead and sign in and you can see right here if i go ahead use goo it supports google authentication everything is powered with redux so this is a for imessage clone and you can pretty much see it supports everything we want so let's go ahead and say yo this is insane and there you go and even has those nice little animations so if you guys want to see how to build that let me know right now get that energy up guys and we can go ahead and get this thing built uh for you guys so today's actually a pretty fun build we've got a lot going on here we have material ui we have all that fun stuff we have material ui we have firebase support in the back end so we have a real time back end right now here so let me go ahead and draw oh this is yesterday's session let's go ahead and show you guys so we've got a bit of material ui going on over here for these little icons the avatars being used over here we've got a really nice use case of flexbox in today's build and everything that you see here is powered by firebase so we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and power this up using firebase and then once that's done we're going to pretty much go ahead and completely get this thing built out with redux so redux is going to support everything it's pretty much how the user authentication is being stored at the moment so how we know which users logged in so right now obviously i'm the latest chat but let's go ahead and refresh this and you can see it signs me in automatically let's go ahead and sign out and sign back in as let's say i'm going to sign into cardi's account let's check this out um let's go ahead and check it out so now i'm in let's go ahead and see so now it says yellow and this one and here i'm going to say yo what's up sunny so i'm pretending to be kazzy right now and there you go comes up as kazi so it's kazzy's message right here and he says yo what's up sunny and what you can also do is you can actually create new channels so this button right here will actually go ahead and prompt out um i think it's hiding the prompt from me right now but this button right here basically when we click it yeah there we go uh and it's going to pop up saying enter our chat noise let's go ahead and type in youtube boom and we get a youtube channel and say let's go let's go guys let's go let me do a rocket emoji there we go and there we go guys so everything is up and running and it's all pretty good okay um let's go ahead and see i think everyone if you can see me right now in the build uh in the stream let me know in the comments i see some people freaking out about the glitching and stuff like that but it will be completely back up and running uh so don't worry about that if it's lagging it'll come back all right so this is awesome build what's up samit good to see you again in the house um taruna kate googens excited uh we've got nikhil says bobby sing pumped um priyancey says it's hard for me to imagine life without coffee how do you do it sonny honestly dude i do drink coffee but i'm trying to wean off it right now so getting pretty good walid says yes yes yes everyone is pretty pumped up about today's build and guys if you wanted to build something like this and you've been waiting for this kind of thing let me know because i'm always interested in seeing who's waiting for this build um oh nice dude anjali is 14 years old and so far has completed seven bills that's insane that's awesome man um hey brian she says ah redux let's go chat apps are legit my favorite builds exactly let's go so we just go ahead and some people want to see it because i see uh we've got loads of people coming in hey check this out sami thank you so much for kickstarting the donations he says coffee is on me sonny you know what dude i'm gonna use that tomorrow and i'm gonna order some coffee so i appreciate that dude and i hope that new job samit landed a job i think he landed it in new york or boston but one of the two and he's absolutely smashing it so awesome stuff to me thank you so much for that donation um we have uh minh minhaj khan says will this class be recorded yes it will be recorded um somebody says i'm gonna add the apple sign in by myself yeah so guys pretty much go ahead and add on to this build once it's done and um thank you so much psycho code says these builds are better than udemy paid courses dude i agree so with that said guys let's go ahead and give you one more run through of the app so this is the app we're going to be building today you can pretty much go ahead and add channels or chat rooms and what i'm going to do at the end if you stick around to the end so for everyone who's going to stick around to the end you guys are actually going to go ahead and get a chance to play with the app right so it's going to be pretty much fully functional you guys can see it working you can see everything built out and how we deploy and how we do all those that fun stuff um and also we just hit 300 people watching right now so amazing stuff guys thank you for the positive energy the love and support you guys always dropping and if you're ready for this build guys smash the thumbs up button let me know let's get this video out to so many more people so that way we can get um yeah we can get as much value out there as possible we're at 300 viewers that's insane um okay so one more run through of the app here is the app guys supports all of the google login functionality so if i go ahead and click sign in we've got all of our google login so you can see here's google authentication powered by firebase and then you've got this lovely react flip move animation so you see that guys that's pretty dope that's pretty clean right so with that said um let me know guys as well if you have actually gone ahead and used um redux before so if anyone's used redux before let me know because redux is something which is you're all gonna find super super valuable inside of a commercial environment so all of that good stuff they ask for redux experience um oh nice johanna's johannes sorry if i pronounced that one let's go papa react johannes from live from south africa starting my internship on monday good stuff dude good luck for your internship and that's what we're talking about um somebody says what's the difference between react js and redux so react.js is the library that we use to build progressive web apps uh redux is how it's called a state management library so it's pretty much how we manage the flow of data inside of the app so how we pretty much store everything inside of our date and inside of our app and go through all that cool stuff so we're going to pretty much go ahead and do that um right so uh garveet says hey sony has used this yesterday to completely show my bills off to my father so dude honestly if he's uh not willing to spend it it's completely fine just carry on doing it man like you can pretty much go ahead and keep learning and you can pretty much go like as far as you can go like and there's no limit you don't need to have special special materials or anything like that you can pretty much go ahead and just practice coding abilities and you know keep pushing your skill set and keep it good vibes you know positive energy and that's what we want to do so oh nice thank you so much brian kim shout out from korea one of the dopest content appreciate you dude that is awesome thank you so much that means we're at ten dollars already thank you so much guys and we haven't even started yet so this is awesome uh road to one million subscribers so with that said guys before we start the tr the live session today i want to go ahead and show you guys in the first link in the description we have a completely free training which i recommend every single one of you go ahead and check out so it's the first link in the description please go check it out and sign up okay so sign up for this and this is gonna go ahead and help you guys um because it's completely free and we pretty much go ahead and break down the netflix clone for you so you guys can go ahead and check out um the entire build from start to finish and how you can use um a firebase as a backend solution so make sure you sign up to that it's a threehour free training that we provide for you guys so go ahead and check it out and that's going to be something which is super valuable for you guys so um yeah go ahead and do that so with that said let's jump into the build so the first thing we want to do guys is we're going to be using create react app but the redux template so if i go ahead and type in redux into google and don't worry if you're beginning if you're new to redux then completely fine you don't need to have redux experience or anything for this build you can pretty much go ahead and carry on so yeah pretty much go ahead and check that out i think radu is saying i love this channel but appreciate you dude thank you so much um hey look at this muhammad getting younger this is awesome because i am 11 years of age until now i've successfully completed two builds thank you very much prashun awesome stuff man reach out to priyanshu branchu is uh 13 years old and he's building as well so you guys might want to connect and that'd be awesome for you guys um awesome stuff right so let's go ahead and jump into the build so here we're going to go ahead and click on redux getting started and you'll be able to see and this is handy for you guys if in case you ever forget what to do um let's go ahead and check it out sorry for the lag if there is lag uh i mean it will come back don't worry guys it will be completely fine in a bit um so don't stress too much about the lag issues that we're having right now um yeah everything will have a way of figuring itself out so we're going to go ahead and use this command so it's mpx create react app but we're using dash dash template and then redux right so let's go ahead and open up a terminal i'm going to pull up a terminal right here make it big for you guys and then we're going to go ahead and i'm going to go into my desktop i've got a clever programmer thing here so i'm going to do mpx create react app and then rather than so here you basically say npx create react app and then the message of your app so here i'm going to go ahead and say it's imessage clone imessageclone and it's um a message clone and i'm gonna say youtube and then it's dash dash template redux and while we're at it so let that load and thank you so much another donation from rajvir singh chauhan he says hope this way of learning will change the trends in universities kudos to the clever programmer team for helping upcoming and existing force in industry um you guys are about to shift the paradigm dude that's exactly what we're aiming for honestly i i went to university and i found that like it's completely outdated everything is completely like you know it's just not really like it's not what you really need in the industry so we're trying to shift all of that and trying to give you guys the most like uh the most sort of critical pieces of content and critical value to you guys and provide you with all that value so that way when you get into that sort of workplace or commercial environment you guys can just thrive and you guys can kill it okay uh and i agree with this good to see so many young programmers in the chat no dude trust me it makes me feel too but uh awesome stuff guys and hey girlfriends in the chat go ahead show her some love um yeah with that said guys let's go ahead and jump in all right so if you guys already haven't uh make sure you go ahead and follow me on instagram down here uh shoot a story if you're watching right now and then before we start smash the thumbs up button let's hit a thousand likes again today and um we're gonna absolutely crush it today so jumping into the build we can see our terminal command just finished off so now we're going to go ahead and do cd imessage clone youtube and we're going to be inside of it and then i'm going to do code dash insiders for you guys it'll be the code dot but for me i've got the beta edition and then you want to go ahead and start up so this school should pop it up uh because somebody says i'm 25 let's code and smash that dude i'm telling you man i agree with you i'm i'm just turned 26 so i feel your pain but we'll kill it don't worry dude um so let's go ahead and uh and this is my girlfriend look if you aren't following me you're liking my videos then get on it now exactly guys um oh ahmed bilady good to see you dude i haven't seen you in a while nice to see you back on the streams um okay so now what we're gonna do is make this full screen um for some reason spectacle's not working oh man okay my keyboard shortcuts aren't working one sec bear with me guys it's always like when i'm on live streams there we go all right so what i'm going to do now is go ahead and some reason this doesn't want to behave um all right give me one sec let me go ahead and open up a new terminal like this uh i wish i could build a book one on one coaching with sonny you can book a oneonone coaching with me um why is my god damn it um okay never mind we can pretty much do it this way so with that said guys i'm gonna okay i need this shortcut give me one sec give me one sec because it kind of messes everything up so in the meantime let's go ahead and answer some questions from you guys and we can go ahead and do that so let me go ahead i'm going to close this and almost close the entire stream um i'm going to open it up again and now yay there we go guys so i use this i don't know if you guys know but i use this keyboard shortcut quite a lot and without it i think my build time would be extremely long so that's what i was trying to get to right now so i'm gonna close this one give me one sec guys one second there we go we're back we're back right energy's back let's go ahead and get this thing going so now this is the shortcut i was talking about see it doesn't seem like much but trust me to be able to do that very quickly on a live stream it's very important so yeah and also guys yeah quick question who would buy some proper react merch so if you would let me know because i'm actually looking at that with my girlfriend and we're quite we're quite uh on that so let me know um and they might have a big surprise for you guys very soon so with that said jumping in you want to go ahead and hit command j and then you'll see the terminal up here npm start to go ahead and start up the app and while that's happening um it will actually go ahead and start up in localhost 3000 so that's what we're going to do right here so this is our app running and here we go so this is what you're going to get to start with okay um so let's go ahead and do this boom boom boom make it a bit bigger for you guys now when you get to this screen everything here is being powered by redux so redox is a state management tool and that's going to help you guys go ahead and manage the data flow inside of an app so here if i go ahead and do 20 add amount you see adds by 20s if i do add async it's a little delay and that's meant to mimic the sort of network request and things like that okay um uh paulo says why using code and sizes uh so i'm actually i just like i'm a big fan of like beta tools i kind of messed around with beta stuff so you know go ahead and check out gaming mat says hoodies would be cool i know dude that's what i'm thinking like a like you know black hoodie with upper reactor still um yeah well we'll go into that in a bit so right now what we're going to do is the cleanup process so we're gonna go ahead and delete the app.test.js logo and setup tests.js over here move that to the trash and then we're gonna get this the app's gonna start freaking out so a few more things we're gonna do we're going to go inside of app.js delete everything inside of the header okay so we're going to go ahead and remove all of that say h1 and we're going to go ahead and say um nice powder says you have changed my life uh so yeah that's awesome stuff dude good stuff right here i'm going to say let's build the i message clone dope all right so we're going to go ahead and do that and then in the top here i'm gonna get rid of lines three and two save it go into app.css command a delete everything you don't want any prestyling before we start in index.css i'm gonna show you guys we get this annoying bit of spacing at the top right so you see over here there's this a normal sort of uh annoying little gap over here we're going to get rid of that right now by going to the top going ahead doing asterisks and then saying margin colon zero and this will go ahead and reset the margins and now we have a starting canvas okay so that's going to be really really uh nice to start with um so with that said guys stop freaking out i can hear i can see so many people saying like i can't hear you yes you can i mean i can see the levels you guys can definitely hear me um right so with that said i'm going to go back to aptos yes let's get rid of that and then now well you see this features on the left right so features on the left what i want you guys to go ahead and do is go ahead and you want to first get rid of counter dot js encounter module we're not going to need those and then pull count a slice outside the photo right then you're going to see counter right here i'm going to right click click on delete because we don't want that folder that's actually a folder inside of features then i'm going to grab counter size and put it back in features so now should have a folder with that counter slice inside of right um hey fujiko's in the house what's up elizabeth uh she actually just landed a job so dope stuff uh let's go ahead and carry on uh why have i done that there we go and now we're going to do is don't worry about all the jargon inside of here just yet but you see right now it's freaking out so we need to go to app store.js uh and then here you're going to pretty much go ahead get rid of the counter save it and that will get us to our starting point okay um so loads of people are always asking about what that command was why i first used so it was like something like this where i did code insiders dash right um dot so what you want to do is command shift p inside of code inside or inside of your vs code oh man bless you again hey fever already um so what we're going to do and yeah i will slow down in a sec this is just because this is the starting point so here we're going to go ahead and do shell command and then we're going to say install code your one's going to say install code command right thank you so much i see some people saying bless you awesome stuff thank you guys so here we're going to go ahead and get rid of that and we're going to go ahead and do command b and this is a good starting point okay so now somebody said kovid yeah don't worry i had a cough for a while guys it's all gone now all right so with that said now we're going to go ahead oh thank you dude this is dope alex lois says you guys are providing such valuable content in such a fast way that it's hard to keep the pace we'll have to keep away for 22 hours a week in order to go over all your past videos keep going dude i appreciate that and that is awesome man appreciate you um for watching thank you so much um yeah i used to be a girlfriend i love java yeah i love java too um but javascript is you know what we're doing today uh so now we're gonna go to class name changes to a and this is for the bem naming convention okay so this is known as bem naming convention so this is how you name your classes and react to make it more sort of easier to work with easier to scale and that sort of stuff okay so with that said we're gonna go ahead and start the first part of the build so the first thing i want to do guys is actually go ahead and build this part so um let me go ahead and start the app on the on a different server the one that i had so i can show you guys the previous thing that i did and what we can do is we can use that as a comparison as i build this one up okay so um so we're going to go ahead so this is what we're going to build right so this is the login page but right now we're not too bothered about the login page i'm just going to sign in for now we're going to build this part later uh the first thing we're going to do is actually go ahead and build a so we're going to actually go ahead and build the chat component so this thing right here and the the this is the chat component sorry and the sidebar component so this thing over here right so we're going to go ahead and do that first so the first thing is um psycho coda says sonny do you remember the debate over bam comment in one live stream i think so dude uh i remember some kind of like some kind of thing daniel tope you guys are dope appreciate you dude thank you for watching um and yeah please don't spam guys like come on you know keep that chat clean otherwise you're gonna get blocked and you're not coming back all right so now we're gonna go ahead and create and what i'm gonna do today is i'm gonna show you why i'm gonna create an imessage component right so this is gonna have this entire app inside of it and this one i'm going to go ahead and create right now because it's going to freak out because there's no imessage component whoa check this out gabriel damn dude he goes come on everyone show your support this channel is cheaper than most monthly learning platforms appreciate you gabriel that is insane uh huge 20 donation uh thank you so much and yeah that is that really really awesome stuff and that's the kind of energy that we want in this channel this is the kind of people we want in this channel thank you so much dude appreciate you uh somebody also says do you love yeah i mean i i'm interested in fly i know kelly hayden does a lot of flat stuff so i've been looking in that space as well um so i'm going to create i'm going to create a component called imessage.js right and then i'm going to use my beautiful rfce trick to go ahead and create the snippet and then i'm going to say import imessage imessage.css i'm going to create a corresponding css file so now we go back and it's going to freak out so we're going to create an imessage dss file so imessage.css and then you guys are going to go ahead and see that it's still freaking out and this is because inside of app.js we need to import so i'm going to say import imessage from imessage imessage there we go what's my thing acting all with okay yeah and now pretty much i'm going to render the entire app in here okay so this is going to be there is a purpose for this and it will show you exactly how we're going to do that soon um but for now i want you guys to do is go ahead and type in imessage here and then we're going to go to our code and this is not going to be camel case just for simplicity yeah because sometimes some people might do it you know capital m some people might not so we're going to keep it super simple going back we've got there are two things inside of here right we've got the sidebar and we've got the chat that's what i mentioned before so if we go back to our app before we had the sidebar and the chat so um where's my drawing tools my beautiful drawing tools all right so now we've got this sidebar element right and then we've got this chat element okay so i'm going to create those two here so that's what we've got over here so that's why i like to do this little commenting right here because it helps you sort of you know piece together what you're going to have inside of the app um so call mile says when would you do a class function verse functional i would say always triangle with functional functions more the modern approach and you should be able to go and check that instead um hey daniel says yo papa react what's up dude glad to see you in in in today's video so what we're going to do is we're going to first build the sidebar right so i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar go ahead create the file so sidebar dot js rfce i'm going to go ahead and shut that down and then here i'm gonna say this is the sort of you know the setup every time we create a new component we're gonna create the css file that goes along with it we go ahead and set up the div with the bem naming convention so here i'm gonna say sidebar boom done and i'm going to write h2 saying i am the sidebar there we go and then i'm going to go over here create the sidebar.css and there we go all right so we have that done go over to imessage and let's go ahead and pop an import on this so i'm going to actually make this a little bit bigger for you guys so that way you guys can see it there we go um and then here i'm going to say import why isn't my clever little trick working oh yeah there we go so control space by the end of the line here and it will go ahead and import it for you and then we can go ahead and do uh thank you so much to to fikou rahman's tommy tom kim sorry you guys love your white pop react appreciate you dude channel says hi sonny hey what's up dude thank you for watching and guys if you're enjoying this and you enjoyed yesterday's video or if you're even here yes in yesterday's video smash the thumbs up button because we hear a thousand likes to them yesterday and i think we can go ahead and um we can break a thousand today as well so if lucha code elizabeth says that trick is a game changer along with emmett 100 it makes you such a faster developer right so that's gonna be really really cool for you um oh why papa meron popper is not popping up today hey david will be back in the channel hey i'm gonna give i'm gonna let david know that he said that um so we've got the sidebar here right so what i'm gonna do is actually render it out so you see it says i am the sidebar so we know it's working um somebody says is it too late to start coding at 17 hell no dude start as soon as you want or later you want doesn't matter man just start all right the next thing i'm going to do is create the chat component so actually let's go ahead and build out the sidebar first all right so um ayush patel says it's 1.5 k now for yesterday damn yeah so like see we're making moves on that so sidebar let's go here and what i'm going to do is you guys like this when i did this yesterday i'm going to drop the sidebar underneath my code like this so you can see my css underneath and my code at the top that's a kind of easier way to visualize it as well so i think it might help you guys out now the first thing we're going to do is i'm going to have a header section so the header section is going to reference this bit over here okay so this is the the sidebar header so i'm going to go over here and create a div called sidebar i'm going to say header okay so over here we've got the div with the sidebar header and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to create another one and this one's going to be called sidebar chat so div sidebar i'm just going to score chats and that's going to be responsible for you guessed it these this list of chats over here okay so we're going to go ahead and do that right now inside of sidebar header so you see we use we use material ui in a bunch of places right now we've got it for this icon right here we're going for this icon over here so the avatar being shown over here and we're going for this little pencil icon that we use to create a new channel so in order to do that we need to go ahead and install material ui right those people asking what's the best way to then react just watch this channel man watch this channel watch the builds go ahead and do that and that will be your quickest most effective way of doing it so we're going to go here i'm going to do material ui.com so you can just google it and it should pop up then you want to run this command npm install material ui call right so this command is very important right now so then what i'm going to do is go back to my terminal so i'm going to hit command j to bring up terminal right now we have it running here i'm going to hit this little plus icon and we should see a second terminal pop up and then i'm going to go ahead and do npm install material ui core right anthony what's up dude he says yo sonny uh that's awesome just dude oh sorry i was responding to another comment as i had that one pinned um right yeah still okay so with that done we're going to install that then we're going to go back here go to the top where it says search and then i'm going to say icons and thank you so much for charlie for putting a little code snippet in the chat that will help a lot of people out here with the installation i'm going to go ahead and do material ui icon so we need to install the core and the icon set okay so those are two things that we need to do to get started um if you guys are enjoying this by the way let me know we'll keep the builds coming all right so back to the build here now i'm going to hit command j to hide it and the first thing i'm going to do is at the top over here i'm going to have the so we have the avatar right so i'm going to go here and i'm going to say avatar and then here i'm going to say source right now the source at this point we don't have an image for it so i'm just going to leave this blank okay and this will go ahead and it'll pop like a dummy avatar in so it says avatar is not defined so here i'm going to hit control space at the end it says auto import from material ui gives me the import statement um i'm going to go ahead and save it refresh avatar is not defined should be defined now so let's go ahead and refresh we should see it there we go all right so it says i'm the sidebar and we've got the avatar popping up which is the little icon right here uh mando loves the emma emmett trick yeah obviously emmitt is insane man and it makes you such a fast decoder so make sure you take full advantage of that the next thing we're gonna do is create sidebar underscore underscore input boom i'm gonna do that oops input and then i'm gonna go ahead and inside of here i'm gonna have a few things i'm gonna have to search icon right so the search icon we can pull in from material ui so i've got the import up here so i'm going to go ahead and pull that in i'm going to close this to make it easier for you guys to see and then and then i'm going to go back down and create an input right so this is going to be an input the placeholder of search so you see right now we're starting to pop out some of the stuff now we don't need to say i am the sidebar we don't really care about that also where we say let's build the messenger clone imessage coming here and that so going back here we're going to go ahead and do so and david to work on that bro so loads of people are looking forward to the imessage uh to the react native stuff it's coming just bear with me okay it's coming guys it's coming it's a lot of work going on behind the scenes um yeah it's definitely on his way um then we're gonna go ahead and after this we're gonna have the another icon button right so we're gonna have that little icon over here you guys see i'm gonna go ahead and pull that in so the thing to go ahead and do that is it's actually called this right here so it's called rate review outlined icon so i'm to go ahead and import that from material ui so pull that in at the top and then save it and we should see that in just a second and what i can do is you see right now this is not clickable right so to make a but an icon clickable with material ui all you need to do is actually pretty simple you go ahead and you import something called icon button yeah so i didn't auto import and then basically this takes a child so pretty much you go ahead and expand it i'm going to pop the icon inside of it and that will actually make this clickable so you see now we get that beautiful ripple effect so if you didn't know that and you now know that so go ahead and um go ahead and and hit the thumbs up button also thank you so much pada he says uh sunny i have become the biggest fan of you bro love you bro sorry maybe never keeping everyone in the in the comments in check uh you know that's that's why that's why i'm everyone's remembering you know that's why we love her right going back so rishi seek says please slow down everything is going to be recorded guys so don't freak out um and we've got a lot to build through today which is why we're keeping the speed nice and high okay so next thing you know we've got the icon button right so i'm going to give the icon button a class so i'm going to here i'm going to say class name of sidebar chats sidebar chats like this save it and then i'm going to go no no sidebar chat sorry it should be sidebar uh input button we're going to go ahead and use that so we can reference this afterwards and then i'm going to make also i'm going to give this a variant okay so i'm going to say this is a variant and i'm going to go ahead and say outlined also guys if you're following along with it right try not to be following line by line and just copying things try and watch it and enjoy the content right and oh snap check this out so athaba is inside the course we work with him and he's a dope student um and he's actually gone ahead and he wrote a blog with us it's on medium right now on the clever program you guys can go ahead and check it out but we just oh that's so sick man we just dropped an amazon 50 page plus blog and it's now reached 3.3 k views uh well done nata that was insane dude i really really enjoyed that read as well so crazy stuff man and and well done right oh i pinned it here as well uh let's go back okay so now we're gonna we have the sidebar chat section underneath so i'm gonna go ahead and first start a bit at the top thank you rag vender for the super chat appreciate you dude um so i'm going to save that and now let's go ahead and style this so it looks a little bit more like the top right so i'm going to go ahead pull up the sidebar oops pull up the sidebar.css split that page over here and then we've got our stuff over there and we don't need as much room so i'm going to do that now here what i'm going to do is go ahead and for the sidebar i'm going to say dot sidebar and i'm going to apply the following thing so i want this to take up 35 the screens if you notice here this is actually taking up only 35 the screen and the remainder is 65 the screen okay so this is taking up 35 on the screen yep and this is taking up the chat is taking up 65 of the screen so in order to do that what we do is we go ahead and say we go ahead and we say flex 0.35 and then we can go ahead and save it let's go back here and you're not going to notice that right now because we haven't actually applied flex to our app so let's go back to app.css go ahead and do the following we just need to say display flex right and we can close that go back here and then i can say height of a hundred view height that's what we want to do and i'm going to say it should have display flex the flex direction of column because everything inside of it we want it to go down yo what's up david david's in the house guys let david know if you're excited for some more man builds and that's gonna be insane um so let him know right now he's in the chat have a chat with david and uh we love you david awesome stuff man all right so then i'm going to go ahead and create a give it a background color so i'm going to go ahead and give that a little background color so now you can see it's taking up 35 the screen and it works as we want it right then i'm going to give it a border right so let's go ahead and give it a border right one pixel solid like gray you see it's very subtle but it kind of gives a nice little design trait right um okay so next thing is the header so i'm gonna go ahead and pop a snippet in over here so we're gonna go here i'm gonna go and say sidebar header should have display flex align the item centrally the padding should be um the padding should be 10 pixels and a height of 50 pixels okay and then for the avatar right i want to have this clickable so right now it doesn't like it's clickable so i'm going to go down here and i'm going to first i'm going to give this a class name so i can style it in an easier way i'm going to say sidebar underscore underscore avatar bam naming convention in for the win and then i'm going to go ahead and paste it here so it says sidebar avatar cursor pointer margin 10 pixels now you can see look at that gives me a nice little like the cursor changes to that finger right so that's going to be a lot more of a user a nicer user experience okay so that's looking good now what we're going to do is get this input looking nice right so the sidebar input let's go ahead and do that so i'm going to make this a bit easier for you guys to see um actually so this is the sidebar input then we're styling it down here so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to say sidebar underscore underscore input and i'm going to say oops i'm going to say display flex boom and then you can see everything gets pulled in centrally i'm going to say align item center and then we'll say justify content center as well because i want my everything to kind of be centered equally as it gets bigger when i say flex one i want this to take up the most room in that container you might not tell now but if i make this bigger i mean it's limited to 35 but you always want to have it being responsive if something changes background color let's go ahead and give it a background color save that and you can see we're starting to get this little background color over here hadi says hello sunny what's up dude good to see you here and then we're going to go ahead and change the color of the text to gray so i'm going to go ahead and say color gray and then i'm going to say border radius of 5 pixels all right you're probably wondering this don't look nothing like this right so how do we get it to finishing stage right now we're going to go ahead and target the inner input because right now we're targeting the div so here i'm going to say sidebar input and then target the inner input and we're going to go ahead and say border of none save it okay it's looking a little bit better and then i'm going to go ahead and say background transparent okay okay that's looking clean and then the final thing is you see when i click it we don't we get this horrible blue outline so to get rid of that we go here and we say outline width and make it a zero save it and now boom we don't get the outline width all right so it's a neat little trick for you guys so we can go ahead and save it and then uh i'm gonna go ahead and check also the input button right so the input button everything's good now yeah so awesome so with that said now we're gonna go to the sidebar chats right so the sidebar chats so this section right here now in this section is where we have everything looking like this right so we have all these sort of sidebar chats individually all right um hey we've got another super chat from aragovenda thank you so much it was my first ever super chat ever love your work on the mern stack tinder cone can you recommend me a framework for complete full stack react so react's not a framework but it's a library um but this is all you need to go ahead and get the front end built out and then you can pretty much go ahead and use firebase or you can use the man stack to go ahead and build the back end but the one that you're looking for is react awesome so john cena says hi uh papa react hashtag some react is waving loving it hey what's up dude good to see you here all right so now what we're going to do is bring in the energy back into the room um also guys if you haven't already smash the thumbs up button get this video out to as many people as possible we're nearly at 400 likes so thank you so much guys and we're going to keep the energy high today so sidebar chat right so over here what i'm going to do now is i'm actually going to have a sidebar chat component so here i'm going to say sidebar chat right so sidebar chat and then i'm going to go ahead and create and now each of these sidebar chat components is going to resemble one of these rows okay so i'm going to go ahead and create this file so i'm going to say sidebar chat so side bar chat dot js there we go and i'm going to do rfce and there we go we've got the sidebar chat i'm going to say import boom sidebar chat dot css all right save it gonna go back down here change this to say class name equals sidebar chat oops sidebar chat there we go that's our that's everything set up with that now um fighting kind of old only foreign don't worry dude if you if you're a beginner to this stuff then you don't honestly don't worry just get started with these clones and you'll be enough thank you so much prashun for the donation appreciate that dude 11 year old and you're they're donating literally a smash of the thumbs up button is all we ask and that is cool man uh sony sharma says learn flexbox in your life is much easier 100 100 like it's gonna help you out dude um right so sidebar chat so with the sidebar chat component what we want to do is we're going to have a few areas of this right so the sidebar chat is this component right here now here we're going to have an avatar so i'm going to go ahead and add in an avatar and so inside oops so an avatar inside auto import save the file and now you can see we've got an avatar i mean it's not rendering out right now but if i go ahead and import this it says cannot resolve sidebar css right so sidebar chat we need to create that file save it go back and then you can see as soon as i refresh you see it's there right so avatar done next thing we want to do is we want to have the sidebar chat info right so sidebar chat info is this bit right here so all of this stuff i'm going to consider is the information so that's why we're going to go ahead and do that um oh dude this is awesome man uh pika chong uh so sorry if i said that wrong says thank you very much i obtained a long term contract 40 000 euros a year thanks to your netflix and amazon clone that's another one added to the list of people to get a job that's amazing stuff dude uh everyone go ahead and give a pika a massive congratulations that's awesome stuff dude really really amazing um there's also another one i saw uh i can't find it now but somebody else had another success story so live code says how many years of experience do you have with the react um at this point i'd say maybe maybe four three three or four four years maybe four years yeah potentially but doesn't matter once you even if you have one month you can make money with that right so you just need to keep the positive energy uh you don't need a huge amount of experience you just need to stop right next thing we're gonna do is create sidebar so i'm gonna say sidebar chat underscore underscore info right and inside of here we're gonna have a h3 with a channel name so it's gonna say channel name and this will obviously be like one of these like yo testing test while youtube and so forth and then i'm gonna have a p tag this is going to have the last message that was sent so imagine if i'm inside of this and we say abc you see it says abc because it's the last message that was sent so i'm going to say last message sent dot dot keep the suspense you know and then i'm going to go ahead and add a small tag so it's just a small piece of text and this is going to be a time stamp right so again it's going to be like a little timestamp in the corner i'm just going to add it in for now like this all right with that said we're going to go and style this to make it look a little bit more like this right now okay um thank you so much uh rosh kneebarad says love all your videos keep you up keep up the support dude really appreciate you um what happens after you log in refresh off the login jonathan jonathan jonathan check this out dude so i'm logged in right now for refresh boom logs me in we have persistence with redox and google authentication so it's uh it's really powerful okay um going back to the react redux so here what we're gonna do is we're gonna open up our sidebar chat dot css sidebar chat and then here i'm gonna start coding these styles first thing i wanna do is say dot sidebar chat and then open parentheses display flex and then i'm going to say align item centrally and then save it and you can see everything goes into a line right then i'm going to say padding i'm going to say 20 pixels because i want to give it a bit more spacing around it i'm gonna give it a border bottom of one pixel light gray solid do that boom gives that a nice thing and then i also want it to have a cursor when i hover over it right because we want that sort of nice uh user experience so cursor pointer and then there we go so somebody says how is this build different from whatsapp clone apart from the ui so firstly the whatsapp film wasn't built with redux whatsapp chrome was built with the react context api um so no it's going to be a little bit different to that secondly we have a few other elements so the build is slightly different to the whatsapp clone but yeah the main thing here is redux is powering it all so redux is the thing that's going to land you the job as as opposed to um as opposed to somebody who who won't get the job redux something which you're gonna need when you're applying for professional jobs and i really recommend you learn it right now so starting with this clone uh preshoon thank you so much dude he says donated 20 uh real things rupees in your imessage clone you guys are taking such great efforts to make these brilliant tutorials this is just a small token of appreciation dude for an 11 year old thank you so much man that is really really awesome thank you going back i'm going to make a hover effect i'm going to say when we hover over it i'm going to change the background color to blue and the color of the text to white let's go ahead and do that save it and now you can see we get this you see we're building this pretty fast man so now if i go ahead and hover over it looks really good okay we're almost at 500 likes as well guys at 402 so let's keep pushing that like count get this video out to as many people as possible oh nice many says maybe a suggestion for next video is to start components 100 style components react native ragna is something fun coming right next thing we're going to do is start the info section so here i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar info go ahead and hide the sign and then i'm going to go ahead and do a margin left because right now it's touching the avatar right here i don't want that i'm going to say margin left of 15 pixels okay save it it pushes it slightly away that's nice and then i'm going to go ahead and do position relative because i want that time stamp inside afterwards to be on the top right i'm also going to say width of 100 okay now next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to target the small tag that we added in inside of this i'm going to say go inside the container the info container and the small tag and i'm going to say make it position absolute but because we made the parent relative it's actually not going to behave in a crazy way right if i do this and i say top 5 pixels away from the top now you can see it sticks to the top if i say go to the right of zero and now you see the time stamps over there right so this is how we do these kind of things right and we get those little things uh in place so as a young person can i still make money programming dude 100 billion percent we have people inside of profit with javascript right now right let me let me just send the message out right now if you're young if you're old it doesn't matter what the case right whatever age you are yeah as if you're here right now so you're starting off that coding journey okay now it just followed up with another one so he's 11 years old and he says what do i need to to know to start coding to start learning react whoa dude damn that's a big donation that's uh i'm i'm not sure how much that is dude uh but thank you so much and i'll answer the other question afterwards but william wong says you are giving me clean and clear understanding from modern javascript development without tons of reading docs so thank you very much and the pwj community william wong thank you dude and we love the energy that people like you bring into the community so amazing amazing stuff really really appreciate that big donation dude now back to the question as to if you're young and you're in a code what i would say is look you're here right now you're in the right place right what i also want you to do right now and this is everyone watching right now go into the description sign up to the free training right the tree free webinar training the reason being because that is a free training guys and that's going to allow you to go ahead and get you know more free value so if you haven't already signed up to that make sure you go ahead and do it let me know in the comments after you've done that right and then go ahead and check it out um also somebody says hey sonny what do you think would be a great way to not lose touch with an old programming language you've learned for example you're learning javascript and you're forgetting python okay very good question but i'll quickly answer this one then we'll carry on with the build right what i would say to this question is you're never actually going to go ahead and learn you're never going to go ahead and forget sorry the languages before so for example i've coded in python plenty of times before but i haven't coded it in ages doesn't mean i forgot python but if you understand programming principles well for example data types like what is an array how what is a four loop what is a loop uh you know it was a four sorry um like was it if condition sorry and a for loop and things like that then as long as you know that right then those things are transferable doesn't matter what language you're coding in right they're just pretty much you can go ahead and hop between them and it really doesn't matter so if i need to code in python tomorrow you can pretty much use all the skills i have from today and pretty much go ahead and pick up python really quick so that's why i'm gonna go ahead and mess out with mess around with uh react native again react native is javascript so it's gonna be very easy to transition over to but also things like flutter flutter is something which i would recommend going and checking out gabriel graves says that big donation by william wong was 19.35 dude amazing thank you so much um and appreciate taruna coogan says thank you so much bro thank you dude for watching um yeah i love the energy today guys really really positive stuff right so this is looking good right so we can pretty much all of these avatars we can go ahead and customize it with a picture in a bit for now what i'm going to do is go back to this sidebar.js i'm going to go ahead and copy it and basically just paste it out to test it so imagine we had a bunch of channels there you go we can pretty much this is starting to look a lot like our build right now if i was to go ahead and spam this thing so that it goes a bit longer you see it we kind of broke the page right the page isn't really working in the way we expect it to so to fix this what we're going to do is we're going to go over to our sidebar.js sidebar.css sorry and what i'm going to do is target sidebar chats so sidebar.css i'm going to pull this underneath i'm going to target sidebar chats and inside of sidebar chats what i'm going to say is i'm going to say overflow scroll right so as soon as i do that now now it has a scrolling functionality right so that's a lot more cleaner and would be uh really really like much more of a nice user experience doesn't look broken anymore right um so and also i don't want this horrible scroll bar but i want to keep the scrolling functionality right uh right so sun kit dev says i've watched signed up for the webinars and one and it's important i'm now confused with to watch this or the webinar so honestly for the webinar we we show that quite a few times so don't worry watch this for now and then you can watch the webinar afterwards um so yeah that's a good way of doing it um a lot of people said can we expect react me it builds later on 100 dude react native is coming later on um somebody says do you need to learn vanilla javascript before learning react i would recommend learning the basics we do teach the basics inside a profit with javascript if you're interested in joining cleverprogrammer.com forward slash pwj right um okay so overflow scrub so there's a little trick that i want to show you guys and what you can do is this there's a snippet of code i'm gonna pop in here and this right here the top one hides the scroll bar for chrome safari and oprah the bottom one holds it for internet explorer edge and firefox once we don't really care about and let's start war with that but then what we're going to do is save it and you can see now we get all that space back right so that's a lot cleaner um but you still have that scrolling functionality right so that's a lot nicer way of doing it we're going to use props to basically customize these so that way they can have different values but that's a step for afterwards um for now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to go ahead and just uh just have like three so we don't overly overload this but right now there you go we've done the sidebar right so the sidebar is now done amazing stuff we're at 432 likes uh we're moving through this build pretty fast uh somebody says react hooks are confusing can you please explain it better i will explain it when we get to that point and yeah for sure dude so now we're going to create the chat component so this part right here on the on the right hand side so for the chat what we're going to do i'm going to go into imessage.js where we have the build going to get rid of my comment over here and i'm going to create the chat component so if i save it it goes ahead and it freaks out because we don't have chat so i'm going to go ahead and say chat.js do my neat little rfce trick go back and i'm gonna go to the top and say import uh chat.css go there create another file oh god create another file oh no no no no no don't do that go to source go back down here create another chat dot css there we go make sure you don't make a mistake like that okay um will all these videos be free on youtube forever yes dude they're going to be free forever right all of these videos are going to stay up on youtube free for you guys they're just pretty much to drop value for you guys so if you like that smash the thumbs up button that's it that's all we ask all right and that will help these three videos get out to as many people as possible so it can help our mission of 5 000 developers right um i appreciate you anupam uh so it says cersei really appreciate your work and god bless tmcp thank you dude so i'm going to go ahead and remove this comment and save it and then i'm going to import the chat component boom go to chat.js and here i'm going to go ahead and say class name uh chat okay now inside of here what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and where we have this right here um i'm gonna go ahead and do the following so we have inside of the chat we have the header right so the first thing we do is we have this header so the chat header and then we have the chat sort of body or the chat messages so this section right here and then we have the chat input it says three sections here okay so i'm gonna go ahead and you know how we do it we like to draft things out so i'm gonna go ahead and first do this i'm gonna say chat header then we have the chat messages and then we have the chat input okay uh awesome stuff thank you so much nathan for the positivity let's keep that energy higher we're holding on to 300 viewers this is insane uh victoria code says hi sonny you're one hell of an amazing teacher thanks for giving us such valuable content appreciate your victoria code and really nice to see you here thank you so much for the kind words so the top part chat header we're going to go ahead and use emmett so we're going to say chat underscore underscore header boom naming convention for the win and then you can see it pops up and then we're going to have a h4 inside and this is going to be responsible for this part right here how is the music making me making you tired dude this music should be awakening you up all right i mean if i if i up here right now that i think that i think i'll wake some people up you know but then we're gonna go ahead and do h4 and here i'm gonna say two and this would actually be the name of the room you're in so for example friends i have the youtube name it'll say to youtube but here i'm gonna say two and we're just gonna say channel name for now okay so these are all kind of placeholders for now all right um then i'm going to go ahead and render this on imessage so save it where is it oh yes you see right now it's underneath here so you guys can actually see us but it's actually popped underneath the reason why that's happened is because if we go to imessage we need to go ahead and go into our imessage.css and i need to do the following and say imessage display flex save it and boom that happens because it's flex so it's flex row um oh man oh man mohammed says sonny i can meet you in london i'm from tottenham hey let's go united kingdom crew muhammad shazad says hi sunny you're an amazing dude master and react appreciate the kind words thank you so much um so this is actually the music that i'm listening to right now is actually part of um i can't remember the comment for the service we use uh i will find that out though but i think it's it's basically the youtube copyright free music and that's the one that we use and i found a nice little rhythm that kind of goes with it um thank you so much adi meinstein goes hi it's my first time watching your stream in a while love brother keep smashing them thank you so much dude appreciate the positivity and guys we're almost at 500 likes this is insane let's keep going all right so imessage let's go ahead um oh dude this is for you amazing so i've been into reacting redox and often it seems like setting up redux to work is pretty annoying yes redux is annoying to set up go ahead and rewind this once this is finished i show you how to use create reactor with the redux template makes it so easy honestly it makes it so so easy um right so now we've got the channel name right here so i'm going to go back into the chat and then we're going to carry on so here we're also going to have a strong tag so strong tag the team are having a team meeting on a team lunch on zoom i feel left out right now damn it so we got details and then we can see here so two channel names details and then inside of here we're gonna go ahead and start this right now so i'm gonna get rid of this comment and i'm gonna also so where it says the channel name i'm gonna span a style here because i wanna style this up so i'm going to say span and i'm going to move channel name the contents of this to here and then i'm going to give this a class name so that i i love this comment dude sunkit dalvi says sunny is a treasure that we all must protect that's amazing thank you so much dude appreciate you uh so funny um all right nice um so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and give this a chat underscore underscore name because it would be like the chat name channel name right so that looks good and i guess the next step naturally is to go ahead and start the top part so chat i've got a new mouse i'm getting used to it right and then we've got this i'm going to say for the chat what i want is i want to have display flex all right display flex direction is going to be column save it and flex is going to be 0.65 now why is it 0.65 because remember this is 0.35 this is 0.65 right because we want to take up the remainder of the room i'm going to say a height of 100 view height and i'm going to say background color of white all right save it boom right trust me it'll make sense in a bit why i set it to white now for the chat header what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy this paste and copy and paste this snippet in right here okay so saving this and you can see now it says having a 20 pixels display flex justify content space between bottom border and a background color right now let's debug it because something's gone wrong here so i don't actually know what went wrong here but you see we haven't actually got this right here yeah we haven't actually got this this like this should be filling out the the bit over here so something went wrong right so we're going to debug this scan to the debugging sort of mood right so i like to get a bit serious when we debug so now we're going to go ahead and find out why this why isn't this stretching all the way over here so i'm going to go ahead and find out why okay so it gets tense guys right because i'm not actually sure why that's not stretching over there so i'm going to refresh to make sure that i've exhausted everything okay and then what we're going to do is chat header right now should go ahead and let's see so the header right now it should be flex okay 0.65 save it oops no i don't want that what did i change all right so chat sits inside of imessage right imessage has sidebar and chat inside of it so let's open up our sidebar dot css and then here we've got 0.35 right so display flex display flex okay what we could do is we could say at this point we could say width i don't really want to do width of 100 i don't really like to do that approach right but why is that happening so we've got flex 0.65 right it's even more stressful when you're live imagine how i feel guys i'm live and something don't work right i'm going to inspect it now so i'm going to show you guys how i do this so i'm going to go ahead pull this out because what we want is this where it takes up the entire space right and i'm not sure why it's not so maybe parent should be some people are saying should be 100 but you see the chat so this is actually flex 0.35 this is flex 0.65 the parent is display flex right but then the width of imessage ah no no width of imessage width of app.css oh i see why i see why all right so notice how app we've done display flex ah there it is all right i'm gonna move myself by the way app there it is guys that is why so we found the issue so you see that i didn't need display flex on the app it was because i then nested it inside of imessage where we had display flex so this was stopping me from using all of the space so we did it guys we fixed the bug hey go ahead and hit the thumbs up button if that was some fun i thought that was pretty cool honestly that was actually something unplanned for i didn't realize that was gonna happen but we did it so let's carry on right uh i'm gonna go ahead and fix that now so go back to our code go back to app.css i'm going to get rid of this we don't need this one right boom oh somebody said the air horn dude you're right man i haven't done the air horn in a while let's go why is that so quiet all right let me go ahead and let me let me do it one more time right three two one and that that that blew my head off but we're back all right uh carrying on right so honestly that was actually something pretty cool because that's not like a real life example of where i ran into a debugging issue and we kind of went through it and solved it together so hope you guys enjoyed that we're 15 likes away from 500 uh 500 likes so smash the thumbs up button if you enjoyed that live debugging session a bit of fun as well with the music okay now back into coding right so now we have that done i'm going to go ahead and hide this him and she said yo that horn sound i know dude that woke me up so yeah i want my neighbors up right um so we've got that looking pretty good right now we're going to carry on styling it out so here i'm going to say we're inside of chat.css so right now i'm going to go ahead and start the chat header so i'm going to say chat header i'm going to target the h4 element inside so if we go into my chat you'll see i've got the h4 here so i'm going to go ahead and target the h4 and i'm going to say font weight of 500 so we want to reduce the weight and then i'm going to go ahead and say color of gray boom right and then you can see it change the color a bit right but we spanned in this chat name right so chat name we're actually gonna go ahead and add a bit of styling to ourselves and we're gonna make this one um so if i go here and i say chat name and i say color black and now you should see the channel name is actually black right um you and the rest of the team are the best also what i need to know to start react just start dude honestly just start like learn the basics on the fly you can go ahead and do that um so yeah just go ahead and start um okay oh somebody says why do you use pixels versus ram very good question actually we'll touch on a different video but we should rem is a good unit to use actually but we're going to go ahead and do that another video okay so now we're going to go and build the um we're going to build the chat messages section right so i'm going to ign i'm actually going to leave this bit right here the middle section so where we actually have the messages i'm going to leave that to after but right now i'm going to build the input section at the bottom okay so i'm going to move myself a little bit and we're going to have the input section uh yeah this is a good point stop repeating and i'm i'm literally going to ignore you i can see when people constantly keep copying and pasting stuff right now i can see somebody spamming the chat you're getting blocked dude like don't do that stuff right uh yeah you're blocked so yeah sorry about that but you know you're asking for it when you when you play around like that so don't go ahead and do that because we want everyone to have you know we want everyone to to sort of be to get value from this uh as opposed to you know just messing around also elizabeth you just earned moderator rights so feel free to block people um right so now we're gonna go ahead and for the chat input i'm gonna first do chat input and then i'm gonna say div chat underscore underscore um input right and then here i'm going to have a form because we like to have the submit functionality where you basically hit the enter key inside the input field i'm going to have an input field and i'm going to have a button which says send message now i will be hiding this button but for now it doesn't matter okay and the goal is we're going to try and change this to look like this thing down here all right so it's going to eventually look like this very nice uh user input form at the bottom so this imessage where it says this bottom thing right here we're gonna have that looking very nice at the end so so somebody says why is it free and we have paid for pwj so this is actually a this is a coach this is not a coaching call guys and also um pwj has a ton more than what we offer on youtube so if you think youtube is good we have all the modules inside the profile of javascript we have coaching calls we have onetoone access we have a community of amazing people inside there everything that is available inside the course in profit javascript is not available here right so uh yeah right so now what we're gonna do is have um we're gonna change the input placeholder to say imessage save it and now you should see it say imessage inside the button we're going to go ahead and fire off a function called send message because the whole point is that when we click that it should send a message okay so we haven't written this function yet so i'm going to write that in a sec so i'm going to go up here and i'm going to say const send message takes an event and it fires off an arrow function then we're going to do e dot prevent default because if i don't do this right i'll show you what happens so if i type in hit enter see it refresh so watch this bit at the top boom boom boom enter and it just disappears right so that's going to be like we don't want to do that right we don't want to have that hey logan's in the house what's up logan good to see you dude uh logan's absolutely killing it and he we work with him daily so good awesome guy he's inside a prophet javascript as well um right so we're actually gonna go ahead and create the send message but we don't want that refresh right we're going to do e dot prevent default thank you so much lloyd for the kind words prevent default oh god whatever we're done here prevent default like this go back save it and then down here basically this is where we do all the sort of firebase magic so this is going to be firebase magic in a bit and yeah now we want to kind of keep track of when i'm typing in right so as i'm typing in here i want to keep track of what's got what's sort of like i'm going to keep track of this input inside of state so in order to do that what i'm going to do is um i'm going to go ahead and do the following so i'm going to go ahead and say const i'm going to use a this the use state hooks i'm going to introduce a piece of state and thank you ankit he goes hey you are doing a great job man thank you thank you appreciate that dude um i'm going to create a piece of state called input and i'm going to say set input and um guys don't please please please don't i'm going to just you're getting blocked you're getting blocked like it really annoys me when i see stuff like that right um go ahead and now we're going to go and do this input set input and i'm going to equals use state right i'm going to import it from react while right so you see we import it at the top and and this is going to initially be an empty string right now to map it to the input field i'm going to say value equals input and then i'm going to say on change equals e set input and it's going to be e dot target dot value right um font size really needs to increase okay so we can make it a bit bigger i mean guys yeah i mean i like i do make it this way but like when we're doing huge builds i don't like it to be so in your face but that's pretty good i think okay um okay next we're gonna go ahead and have also guys bear in mind like imagine you're doing a build and then you're doing like the checking the comments and you're doing all this other stuff it's a lot to take in you know it's a lot to process and do that um lloyd says sunny man dude you just give the but you're just you just give the best of the react appreciate it man appreciate you watching lloyd thank you so much um logan says i got my second pc and up and running with sen os7 running ssh is up on boots so i can remote into it with vs code on windows ah that's jacked man nice because uh kind of awesome i have real linux in my vs code camera that's dope man i like that that's awesome stuff dude all right so what we're going to do next is i'm going to have the send message over here so once with that i'm going to go ahead and say i want to basically after i send the message i'm going to set the input to be an empty string so now if we see if i go ahead and type something in hit enter see it it actually clears out the contents right so that's a good thing so what i'm going to do now is actually go ahead and have this this halfway i'm going to style this input field so it looks like the beautiful finished input field down here that we see at the bottom okay so in order to do that i'm going to go ahead and also please stop asking the same question something any particular reason for using search icon rather than search no dude uh it was just a case of it was the one that i got i found and it worked for me okay so here i'm going to go ahead and do chat dots here also guys don't focus on that stuff like you should be looking at the build not that stuff like honestly if you're focusing on what my import was as opposed to like what the actual functionality is i'm doing you like you know pay attention to the right areas right that's what you need to kind of pay attention to correct areas so i'm going to open up my chat.css and here i'm going to go ahead and say dot chat input right and i'm going to say display flex and i'm going to go ahead and say align item center and then i'm going to go ahead and say padding 10 pixels oh god padding 10 pixels 20 pixels which means 10 pixels left and right uh 20 px 10 pixels top and bottom um and 20 pixels left and right okay then i'm going to say border top one pixel solid light gray boom save that and i'm going to say background color white nice oh no gray sorry i want to be gray okay then what i'm going to say is i'm going to target the form and i'm going to give it a flex of one right because i want the form to take up the most input at the most space i'm going to say flex one and that will actually go ahead and it'll push it as far as it can be pushed and what we need to then do is say target the form and then the input inside the form get a width of 98 outline width of zero border one pixel light green border radius 999 so it gives it a rounded effect and padding and fiber as soon as i save this watch this boom looks nice right and then for the button i'm gonna go ahead and target the button so inside the form inside the button do display none because we don't actually want the button there so now if i type in enter we get a nice sort of functional working input tool okay so that's really really good to show the size says you're great at multitasking great work man honestly dude you get really good at it thank you for noticing that but yeah like i've got a stream deck as well so i can basically go like this any second i can go ahead and just do like fun stuff like this i could say oh things are gonna get real you know like you can do all this kind of fun stuff um but there's like you get really good i'm doing things with my left hand things with my right hand it's crazy but yeah back to the boat um binny binny says you give me hope that i could become a programmer thank you that's awesome man or girl thank you so much for that code codekid says man you are epic guys your energy is insane today really really thank you and also with that said we just broke over 500 likes on the this video amazing stuff guys thank you all for for watching and i really do appreciate and love each and every one of you right um nice i'm gonna go ahead and switch it back to this music i prefer this music right so now back to chat.js i'm gonna then actually next to so outside this form going back to chat.js outside this form we're gonna have a mic button okay so if you notice at the bottom of our build we have this little mic right so i'm going to go ahead and add that in but it's also an icon button which means remember i showed you that neat little trick earlier so it makes it a nice clickable button right um then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and first pop this in so i'm going to say boom i'm going to give it a class name so i can target it easier i'm going to say chat under squad underscore mic and i'm going to do this and now outside this i'm going to say icon button right and then everything inside the here should be mic like this right now for the icon button i'm going to import it same for this i'm going to import this but this one i need to actually import the top so i'm going to go up to the top and i'm going to go ahead and pop it in there save it boom uh so shank says this is the best one keep doing this bro nice thank you um yeah khalid says we're pumped nice that's it man keep this energy high there you go guys look at that we have that nice looking logo on the right okay that's looking good right now i'm going to show you a really neat little trick if you build things in the correct way actually implementing the functionality isn't that bad right so we have the chat messages i'm going to get rid of the comment here so now i'm going to build out the chat underscore messages yeah and inside of here we're just going to have a bunch of messages so like imagine this just says uh h2 of like i am a message save it and then you see it's like i have a message i'm gonna add a bunch of these in right i want this one to always take up this middle space so this should always be pushed to the bottom in order to do that what i do is i go into my chat.css and i go ahead and target chat messages and i just say flex1 because the flex direction of this entire parent is column which means it should push to say use up as much room as possible and we get that functionality so that looks really really good um action says you look a bit burnt out uh videos are super amazing love the effort you are putting in uh appreciate the the consideration dude i'm all good though i'm all good thank you so much for asking um right so now what i'm gonna do is go back to chad.js and i am going to this is the next bit so where do we focus our attention to now let's go ahead and create the uh login section right now okay so login section for now so let's go back to our app.js so here i'm going to say app.js i'm going to go back here so what i'm going to say is i'm going to use redux here so redux i'm not going to actually go through fully of what redux does because yesterday's build we extensively went over some of the redux stuff so you can go ahead and watch that one and then today's one but i'm going to go ahead and break it down in a nice way for you guys so it's easy to understand so i'm going to go into features counter slice i'm going to rename counter slice so everything that says counter i'm going to call this the user slice okay so user now the initial state of the user slice is going to be user and then here i don't need any of this stuff i just want to go ahead and get rid of all these comments i'm simplifying my code right now and here i'm gonna have actually no let me get keep one of these i'll show you why i'm gonna go ahead and change this one to logout this one to login and then i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of this and this should be state.user equals and then we'll get we'll change this in a sec and then when we log in it's state and it passes an action just follow this refactoring step and it will make a lot of sense okay um and then this will be log out get rid of this because we export it so we can use it outside i'm going to get rid of all this crap i'm going to get rid of all of this i'm going to say select this is my selectors here so this is how i access my state afterwards and then yeah that's how we get everything up and running okay so with that done i'm going to go ahead and go back to app store.js i'm going to re change everything here so this will go ahead i'm going to change this over here to user reducer right and then it's going to freak out because we haven't got that file okay so i'm going to go back here and i'm going to go down to counter slice rename i'm going to change this to become user slice save it boom now we have it see everything's working now to test this works i'm going to open up my dev tool so i'm going to inspect go to redux and we should see if i go to the state we now have a user so i'm going to make this a bit more visible for you guys but i know my face is in the way so we've got the user where the user is zero right now so it's perfect okay so the user we don't actually want to be zero i'll go ahead and show you why how we fix that in a sec but now what we do is we go here and the user is not going to be zero by default the user is no okay then what we're going to do is this is just going to be action.payload and this will make sense afterwards and this when we log out the user gets reset to no that's what we do right now what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and quickly give you a quick rundown so this is a quick illustration of what we've done here so this build is using something called redux right now what is redux redux is essentially imagine we have a bunch of components inside of our app so this is a component called app.js right and then everything else is kind of rendered underneath it right so we have like the chat component the header component the sidebar component all of these things right we have chat we have sidebar we have header i mean everything's actually inside of imessage but you know you get the point and then we have message and so forth now imagine we have all these things right so everything gets rendered here and then you also have more components underneath here right so you can have different things being rendered off of these components and and vice versa right now imagine we had a login component over here right now imagine we had when we do the login we get a user object right what if i want to use the the user object over here so what if i want to use the user object over here right if i want to use the user object over here how the hell do i get from here here sorry all the way over here right it's kind of annoying i kind of have to do this long journey of somehow getting my so maybe i initialize the user over here and i pass the setter down there and then i have to do something called prop drilling pass it to this component and then pass it to this one and if i want it over here i need to pass it down to this one and you can already see this is getting super messy right we don't want to do any of this so what we can do is we can introduce something called a data layer or something like redux right so redux kind of essentially surrounds the app right so this is essentially redux and now redux is essentially like an onion so imagine like an onion so this is onion surrounding our app now an onion has different slices inside of it now each slice inside of redux resembles different contexts or like different things inside of our app so we have a user slice and this is going to be responsible for all of the user information then we have something like an app slice this is going to be all the generic information about the app and we can have something like a basket slice and this would basically be uh so i'm just gonna say basket slice right and this would essentially be all of the things inside of the basket so you see and these all belong inside of the layers of the onions right and then what we can do now is when we get a login uh when we do get the user at this side what we can do is we can actually push the user into the data layer so inside of this and then anywhere inside the app so if i want the user uh over here what i can do is i can just grab the user so the user is part of the data layer i can grab the user and just use them in this component and if i need to use the user over here and go ahead and grab the user out of the data layer here so you see once we have it we don't need to pass props around and things like that we can just kind of push things into the data layer by dispatching actions like the login action to get the user into the data layer and then we can pull out the user wherever we want and in order to do this we use something called a selector so in this case it would be like select user okay so i hope that makes a bit more sense if it doesn't feel free to go ahead and check out yesterday's build and that's going to help you guys uh quite a lot nice i saw somebody says onion incoming nice i love how you guys know what's going now um so that's going to help you guys understand things a little bit more okay ali says you guys rock makes it easy to understand really appreciate it all right so with that done and said i'm going to go ahead and create this right here so we've done that now um the next thing is i'm also going to go ahead and prepare something as well so somebody says so what is the disadvantage disadvantages of using the context api at this point so the disadvantages are so it's not this much it's more like redux is more powerful so we for one we have these beautiful redux devtools so over here we have nice little redux devtools where and trust me this comes in very very handy later on so we're going to be using that today also you split your pieces of state into different like uh areas so for example the basket slice the user slice the app slice and things like that so it's a lot more um oh this is a good question actually so logan says it says redux like an object that has pointers from app.js and all its children so think of it as like global state so as an easier way of thinking it right so global state and then all the children beneath app.js or pretty much inside of your app have access to that global state think of it that way you dispatch an action to go ahead and manipulate that global state and then you use selectors to pull from that global state right so in other words always accessible yes pretty much exactly so we have like things like the user is always accessible from any component inside of the app um so i think that's going to help everyone out now to your places last time your video helped me a lot thanks awesome stuff jennifer says hey sonny oh what's up jennifer she says i'm back after watching the discord cone yesterday i'm a totally addicted amazing um we have uh redux a facts loving this whoa nice dude he's got a big donation ten dollars man so it's just gone off all right dude i'm gonna you know one sec this this takes this needs some attention right now firstly thank you so much from dragon eight atom he says um ten dollar donation amazing right because just got an offer as a developer with a 20 salary raise and fully remote damn dude nice no more long journeys back home all from the amazon clone let's go man that's so sick i love seeing stuff like that dude if you can literally reach out to my instagram all right reach out to my instagram hit me up and say sunny i am dragging out and before i donate on you on your live stream i'm pretty much just chat man because i love to see like if i can see some kind of proof or something like that i'm gonna add you to the count of five thousand developers who have landed a job for more content that's insane man and everyone go ahead and drop him some love and some um and some support in the chat right now that's amazing smash the thumbs up button if you want to be like dragon atom i still did amazing stuff um all right logan interesting i love like to see a partially compiled reactor with redux to see how it's actually using redux i'm actually going to show you today so stick around logan um and i'm going to show you when we actually dispatch actions how it modifies the state inside of the app um and it's going to be pretty cool david atta says suddenly you get my job count before december ends ah so i'm talking about dude let's do it david um um okay this is awesome future code says there there's one sure thing consistent and keep building these clones you will get a job many of us are proof no matter what your background or level is it's just a matter of time elizabeth is somebody i do oneonone coaching with uh future code she literally landed a job and now she's doing coaching with me still to kind of keep her skills up today and up to sort of scratch but amazing and and this is truth guys like this is there's proof in the pudding right so you don't need me to tell you there's literally people doing this stuff and they're glanding jobs left and right and it makes me so happy to go ahead and hear that oh man i think i talk like 20 000 words a minute when i'm ready alive okay so uh ashfaq says you're my inspiration and motivation to move to web development amazing dude thank you so much blackout says thank you appreciate you dude um oh another job holy crap dude he says sonny i got a job at local startup all thanks to your spotify clone thanks a lot man again hit me up on my instagram dude i want to go ahead and have a chat with you guys this is insane i love that and well done again guys drop him some love that's amazing to see that right we've got kansas in the house um he goes you're my coding inspiration i'm from kansas and we love you dude appreciate that dude amazing stuff right back to the build so here we have i am a message right uh so what we're gonna do is actually go ahead and prepare the login flow so firstly i need to go ahead and set up firebase so i'm gonna go to firebase.google.com uh make sure all you need is a google account i'm going to go to the console over here i'm going to click on add project then i'm going to go ahead and say imessage clone right when i say i message clone on youtube i'm going to enable google analytics you don't need to enable google analytics but you can if you want i'm going to go ahead and create the project all right now nikhil says sunny how can i do mentoring coaching with you just drop me a dm on my instagram at ssssanga so the one you can see on the screen uh or here it might be easier to see so you can see it over there go ahead follow me send me a dm just saying oneonone coaching and pretty much we can have a conversation dude um and yeah and also send me an email as well as well uh to get the best chance of getting through to me but yeah that'll be awesome um nice all right so clicking on continue right so next what we're gonna do we're going to click this little web button over here and here i'm going to say imessage clone youtube set up firebase hosting boom register the app right okay so you drop to dm nice i get hundreds of dm so i'll go ahead and search through that um maybe send me another one and i can pretty much see that uh we're gonna click next and continues to the console nice people say why firebase because firebase has a realtime database so we're gonna use cloud firestore which is like the nosql realtime database so powerful version it also has authentication it has a bunch of stuff you are trending number four for imessage damn let's go man trending on youtube so that's insane all right so we're gonna go to authentication over here on the left and the first thing we're gonna do is click sign in method what's up alexandros could see you did uh always recognize the face so we're gonna go to google i'm gonna click enable okay i need to enable an email there we go click save okay so that's done and then i'm going to go to this little cog at the top project settings i'm going to go down to config and click the copy button okay i'm going to head back over to my code now and what i want to do is create a firebase.js file so firebase.js right and here i'm going to pull up my terminal i'm going to do mpmi firebase i need to install firebase into my project now while that's doing i'm going to paste and we've got the firebase config then i'm going to say import firebase from firebase because we just we're literally installing it down below as you can see down here and while that's happening guys i can go ahead and set up the next thing so i can go ahead and say const firebase app equals firebase dot initialize app with that config so this is basically going to use this like a key to get into the uh into our firebase end right so um nice he goes man you guys have energy doing all these tutorials yeah man the energy is high today let's go um also here thank you so much raj um he says superb video appreciate you watching dude thank you so much logan very good point here he says firebase is also classified as a back end as a service so it's cutting down the work of the build considerably a hundred billion percent i couldn't agree with that more really nice way of doing it um explaining it uh somebody says firebase is so expensive no dude firebase is free right so and also google if you ever watch this video sponsor us you know guess guess in with the good rates um so then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say constdb equals firebaseapp.firestore so that will go ahead and do it hey if uh khalid says hey i'll dm you the off letter i got keep an eye out for my insta at the real skypes skies nice dude go ahead and send that to me and i'll be awesome right um right uh okay and somebody this is a good point nikhil says i feel like we need journey of react of papa react and how he reached level and from what all resources if you guys want to see that i might actually start shooting some content on my youtube channel which goes behind kind of getting to know me a bit more i guess getting to know me my story that sort of stuff if you guys want to see that then let me know and i'll start shooting more content on my personal account and you know it's just kind of fun you know like you guys can go ahead and see stuff more about me uh that if that sounds cool let me know in the comments all right so boom and if you're not following me sunny sanga on youtube go ahead and check it out um right so with that said now what i'm going to do is i'm also going to say const auth equals firebase.auth right so this is all prepared preparation so this is already done um nice so many people are saying damn yes honestly start a vlogging channel we would love to know more about you um yeah okay i heard you did um loads of people saying it do it it's cool if you've subscribed to me then keep an eye out okay logan says yeah bro you should just vlog on your days out yeah you know i should because me and melbourne are always doing fun stuff going out and about so i think that'll be awesome uh yeah 100 um you guys killed my depression damn love that um you also made me passionate about programming love your content that's amazing and i'm so glad to hear that we helped you out on that journey right the next thing we want to do guys is go ahead and go down here and say cons provider equals new firebase.google author provider so this is like where the magic happens to go ahead and connect it um to somebody says i love you continue thank you so much we're going to go ahead and export the two things so we're going to export um something can you mention these firebase imports exports so they are mentioned that are the methods given by 5s yeah so all of these imports right here so you see like this whereas firebase this is all from firebase it's firebase dot initializing the app firebase app this is using this what we just initialized to go ahead and um get grab the database grab the authentication and then we pretty much go ahead and get our authentication provider right so with this bit done now what we're going to do is i'm going to export the authentication and the provider as something called a explicit uh export and then we'll undo this as our default export so export default db and the reason why i like to do the default db is because we use the db a bit more so i think it's always nice to kind of have the db as your default okay um firebase must just be one monstrous class so obviously even they kind of once it's done and the hard work's done they kind of like compile it into a very nice minified piece of code and i think that's going to be and that's what you end up looking at so if i go ahead and i'll show you actually so if i go ahead and click over onto firebase for example and click into you see like you get the actual typescript files you can see this is their kind of code behind the screen so this is their type definitions um so it doesn't actually show you the code as such because the code is going to be inside of here so you see this is what they did to their code it's all minified um but yeah you can see but then they give you type definitions and that's what that's what gives vs code the ability to go ahead and check out um what is like available when you do when you press like dot and things like that okay so we've set up firebase that's all good now we go back to our chat and what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna go ahead and do the login flow okay so login flow is inside of app.js so here right so we're gonna firstly create a we've already got a user here we've got the select user so what i can do is i can actually use this i can use the select user so i'm going to pull the user here and i'm going to say const user equals use selector and this is from react redux so we need to go ahead and import and then i need to go ahead and say select user and this will import it from features user slice so we're basically going ahead and pulling the user so by default the user will be no okay these are going to be no by default and that's going to go ahead and that's going to give you um nice and somebody says rzo movie trailer says this is cool glad you're enjoying it dude and if you are enjoying and you're still with me smash the thumbs up button almost at 600 likes um so we've got imessage over here and what i'm going to say is if you're logged in so if there is a user if the user exists then what we're going to do is i'm going to say then you render the app so then we render it otherwise yeah i want to render something h2 saying you need to log in okay you need to log in uh we are going to have a logout flow i just made it very discreet in the previous uh example but for example if we're here all you do is you click on the actual icon at the top and it will log you out and that's pretty much how it works i'm just gonna log in again there we go going back boom um all right so there we go uh you see now what it does is it says if there is a user it will render the app otherwise if there's not a user so by default there is no user you need to log in right so this is a good place where we need to be right now so now we're going to build the login page so rather than saying you need to log in i'm going to create a login component okay i'm going to go ahead and create that now so go here and hide all this stuff i'm going to say login.js and i'm going to rfce boom got it and then here we're going to say import login.css and i'm going to go down here to div i'm gonna say class name equals login right and then inside of here we're gonna basically go ahead and build our login but firstly before i do that i'm gonna go ahead and say login.css and then i'm gonna go back to my uh app.js and here i'm going to go ahead and import login like that and now we should be rendering from our login components so i'm going to go here and say login.js um yeah that interpolation is is crazy right so so that's actually called a ternary or uh ternary operator where you can have that sort of if this then that right you can have that as well so that's really really handy to go ahead and use that um so here we're going to have the login login page i guess right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually going to have a login logo so i'm gonna have a login uh logo inside of here i'm gonna have an image the image source i've actually got an image over here this is just pretty much a imessage image so i'm just gonna go ahead and pop that in boom it's a huge imessage uh image and then i've got a h2 underneath it uh h1 which is going to say imessage right and this will pretty much be down here so you can see it says imessage underneath that i'm going to have a material ui button which says sign in okay uh it says button is not fine so i'm going to do my little trick and then it says imported and that trick is control spacebar and it will go ahead and pop that up so now we've got a nice little signin button at the bottom okay so first thing i'm going to do is style this so that way it looks a little bit more presentable so let's go to our login.css and then let's go ahead and do login.css so down here i'm going to do dot login i'm going to say display grid because we're using a grid css grid here i'm going to show you guys a neat little trick so if i do place item center this will actually position everything in the center but you can't see that right now because it's not actually showing much so i'm going to go ahead target the inner div the image which is this huge thing object fit contain keeps the aspect ratio when i resize it and height of 150 pixels makes it small right if i get rid of this display grid now see everything goes to left so if i do this it centers it on the on the screen right so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say a height of 100 view height this will go ahead and make use of the full screen and then i'm going to say a width of 100 right so width of 100 all right i actually don't think i need that but i'm going to keep that for now uh and then what we're going to do is i'm going to go and target that button so i'm going to say target the login button right and i'm going to say width of 300 pixels i want the button to be a little bit bigger i'm also going to give it a background color and this is going to be the imessage blue so boom save that and then we're going to change the color of the text to like a more subtle white i'm going to say the font weight should be 800 as well so i'm going to make a little bit more bold um 800 boom and let's do that save and there you go looks pretty good right now when we hover over it i want to get a little bit more attractive so right now you see it kind of goes white by default we that we can't have that doesn't make sense i'm gonna have it invert essentially and have the color be blue and the background be gray so that looks a bit more cleaner all right so this is all working pretty well okay so alexander says why grid and not flex because that's a really easy trick this one so you can just position the entire container um centrally so it's actually a very very neat thing if you need to do something pretty quick in this case i just wanted to have it very quick and simple in the center of the screen so i went ahead and used css grid right so now what we're going to do is we're going to implement the login functionality so it's a lot easier than you think right because we've set everything up correctly so if you code well guys code something well and then you'll see building on it and all that sort of stuff actually gets very simple because it's not hard to add to wellwritten code right it's not hard to add to the extensive like extensibility maintainability of while we're in code so with that said what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a function called sign in so i'm going to say const sign in takes an event but we don't actually care about the event so we can ignore that and then i'm going to go ahead and say i need to import the authentication module and the provider from firebase our local firebase that we had earlier right and then if i go down here what i'm going to have is when i click the button i want to basically trigger my sign in function okay and i'm going to make the um yeah we have that so now all i need to do is say auth dot sign in with popup okay i go here and i say provider because we initialize this earlier and i don't want to do anything more than that all i want to say is catch if there's any error i'm going to get the error and i'm literally just going to say alert error dot message that's what i'm going to say right alert error.message and that will go ahead and help you out um so if i go ahead and refresh um now if i click sign in boom i get a nice little popup and this should be a google authentication signin there we go look at that everything's connected if you guys think that's cool hit the thumbs up button um that would be amazing to see that number go up to 600 likes we're close we're close i think we can do it um that's awesome stuff okay so with that said now we're still at 250 concurrent viewers that's amazing thank you so much guys um i'm going to have it so now if i look say for example if i've closed it early you see an error occurred so it says uh the alert got caught here and it displayed the message which is what we want okay so now what we need to do is whenever a login event action occurs inside of app.js i'm going to have a listener so a user factor is what we're going to use here so a use effect i'm going to import it from react and then here i'm going to write the use effect use effect is a piece of code that fires off when the component loads and if you put anything inside these square brackets it will fire off again when that changes for example if i had the user in here every time this would fire off once when the app component loads as well as whenever user changes in any shape or form okay so here what i'm going to say is i want to import the authentication module from our local firebase so i'm going to go ahead import it and then here i'm going to say auth dot uh on auth state change this is like listening now for authentication changes and i'm going to say when any sort of change occurs go ahead and use the auth user so i'm going to do that and i'm going to say if there was an authenticated user then the user is logged in else the user is logged out that's basically the logical flow and then what we're going to do is we're going to get the dispatch remember earlier on i drew that diagram uh whenever we want to add something into the data layer or the redux of onion that i described earlier what we need to do is we need to use the dispatch so here i'm going to say use dispatch um and then i'm going to import it from react react redux so use this patch all we say is we say const dispatch equals use dispatch this gives me like the gun to go ahead and fire a change into um i'm just checking the chat okay yeah goes ahead and um yeah so now we get the gun to go ahead and and fire changes our actions into the reducer so that way it can change the data so now we've got that i'm going to go ahead and import the login and log out action from the user right and then what i'm going to say is if the user's logged if the user is logged out i'm going to say dispatch a logout event right and then if we go to our user slice the logout event simply clears the state.user to know again and then here i'm going to say um someone's asking about kaio kailan uh dude i'm not going to speak about java on this channel right now okay so it's all javascript okay so um what i'm going to say is dispatch login so dispatch login and i'm going to pass in a payload which is an object and here i'm just going to pass in the following we'll say uid is the authentication user so this is what comes back from google so we're going to basically we're basically creating an object for the user we're saying that he should have a photo or she shall follow the user auth user dot photo url and this comes back from google authentication let's say an email and this comes back as auth user.email and then we also have the display name so if they have a name on google for example google collects your name when you sign up we should be able to get that from here so we say auth user dot display name okay save that and now you can see we get everything here so with that said now what should happen is we should see if i could have done this correctly if i go to redox now we should see so it logged me so right now for refresh so i log out because we're not logged in right now so you see inside of our reducer inside of our state we see actual user of no which is why i see the sign in screen if i click sign up notice pay attention to over on the right hand side of the screen and if this works go ahead and smash the thumbs up button okay um let's go ahead and click on sunny let's angle gmail so it should go ahead and say user login so there you go it dispatched a login and look at that guys it actually logged us in so that's dope and everything worked as we wanted it right so that's awesome i cut that one up earlier so that's working as we wanted it okay so and you can see now if i inspect the action it's in the user slice and it was the login action okay now the payload for the user was the user id the photo the email and the display name right so everything works on that front and then you can see the diff is also really really handy so you could do your auth user but inside of redux uh it comes up with a serialization issue because you're trying to conveniently sort of serialize that that object so you'll get an error if you do auth uh user or user um but you can that's why i've just stripped out some of the values but there's a way of doing it in that in that way yeah so now you can see um inside the state the user is populated right so any if i was to refresh look what happens it refreshes and it dispatches the login and it dispatches login so persistence is here right so that's awesome so with that said go ahead and smash the thumbs up button because we're almost at 600 likes and the log out functionality i'm going to implement right now for you guys so to log out what i'm going to do is i'm going to have it firstly let's actually go ahead and pull some information from where we didn't need it right so here at the top where we have the avatar so let's go to our sidebar right now inside the sidebar we have the avatar at the top here now i'm going to go ahead and grab the user i'm going to say const user equals use selector and i'm going to say select user which is my selector that i created earlier and i've done all the appropriate imports i needed now with the user what i can do is i can go here and i can say source should be user dot photo now watch what happens boom grab my google login i think that's dope i think that's so dope i think this is getting pretty cool with five likes away from 600 likes pretty sick right when i click on this i want to log out so you're probably wondering oh there's there's a lot of custom coding not really dude what you do is on click and i here i'm going to say i'm going to import the authentication module from firebase to my local firebase so here uh some people are saying how can this be for beginners you're going so fast remember guys this is recorded okay so this is not at the whole point of a live stream it's not meant to be so you can completely like sit alone and type with me it's meant to be so you can enjoy the video watch it you know just enjoy seeing some live coding and things like that and then you can pretty much go ahead and uh pause the video and do it at your own pace afterwards when you watch it back because remember if i was to sit here and wait for everyone that's watching to kind of catch up it's not gonna the video is gonna be a lot longer and a lot less people are gonna find value from it so don't worry it is it is a beginner friendly video you can pretty much go ahead and follow this from start to finish as a beginner and we have plenty of people that have done it and they land their job so quit your complaining let's go all right so here what we're going to do now is i'm going to say an anonymous function auth dot sign out right and then i'm going to say save it and now what we can see is i'm going to show you guys proof of something so i'm going to go here and redux and now you see it signed in so if i go ahead and refresh this is a good comment by the way ayo says for beginners see three to four bills continuously and you'll get the pattern dude exactly exactly that like keep doing that and you're gonna go ahead and see the pattern and it will make a lot of sense right so uh what i want to show you is yes so it dispatched the login up here right now if i go ahead and click the uh the avatar it dispatches a logout action which went ahead and reset the user move my face out of the way it reset the user to no right so now inside the state you should see the user is now no okay so that's what that went ahead and did right so what i'm going to do now is i'm just going to make this actually a little bit smaller so you guys can actually see that bit easier right so there we go um i mean i'm tiny now that's the only thing we're going to make it a little bit bigger i like it it's too small okay so now let me go ahead and sign back in yo athava he goes my mind is blown at the progress i just see right now the blog may go over 5k when i wake up hey let's go dude we just dropped a crazy clever programmer vlog on medium authority go ahead and feel free to drop that on the live chat right now uh and everyone can go ahead and check out the blog when they got a minute there we go so now what we're going to do is it says the channel name and we have the messages right so i guess the next step right now is we want to have this chant these channels right here populated as well as we'll get these messages built out and so forth so for the channel names what we're going to do is these channels are going to not be hardcoded so right now they're hardcoded three sort of things are being popped out right here okay uh also this is a good question do you think react is the way to go on web development i mean is it the future 100 the demand is to the roof and it is really getting busy also we just hit 605 likes thank you so much guys amazing stuff uh love the positivity today and yeah like let's keep going let's try and hit like 700 likes i think we can do it i think we can hit 700 likes um nice that's dope dude also a darva just dropped a link to that 50 page plus amazon complete read through breakdown inside the comment section go ahead and check that out in a sec or maybe open in a separate tab and pretty much you can watch that and read that afterwards but amazing stuff by atarva team is absolutely crushing it man it's insane team is crushing it so here what i'm going to do now is i'm going to have the sidebar.js right and the first thing i'm going to do here is have a piece of state to keep track of this the chats so i'm going to say const charts equal and then set chats and i'm going to say use state right and it's going to have an array empty to ready to begin with now when the app when the sidebar component loads i'm going to use a user effect to fire off piece of code so boom like so right now in here i'm going to have empty brackets for the dependencies um so it's just going to fire off once all right tommy o says i love your cone streams dude i love you guys man i love the support you guys give us it's the only reason i carry on doing them so that's really really awesome to see that then what i'm going to do is i'm going to import the db from our local firebase and i'm going to say db.collection so i'm going to create a collection and inside here we're going to have a collection of chats right and i'm going to say on snapshot so it's going to be a realtime listener which gives us a snapshot of the database whenever anything changes right now when that changes i'm going to say set chats right so as soon as anything in the database changes we get a snapshot and when we get that snapshot back i'm going to say okay go get the snapshot get the document inside the snapshot this is a nosql structure right so if you don't understand what i'm talking about here it's a no sql structure inside of a database maybe watch some of the previous videos watch some of the builds you want you'll understand what's going on here but you can see docs.map and then we're going to say doc and then we're going to say it returns an object right and this object is going to have an id of doctor id and it's going to have the data inside of it as doc dot data now save it okay and it says use date is not defined so we need to go ahead and import use state save it there we go and now we should have chats being pulled in from the database right so here rather than having three hardcoded values what i'm going to say is i'm going to have chats.map and for every single chat what i want to do is i want to render out a sidebar chat boom okay i'm going to render out sidebar chat and there we go nice and then what i'm going to do is where we get the sidebar chat i'm going to destructure it right so remember we actually create an object here of id and data which means i'm going to go inside here destructure this and say this should have id data right inside of the data we're actually going to have a chat name and this will make sense in a second guys bear with me okay and this will all make sense right so so now what we're going to do is we have the sidebar chat okay so what we're going to have is i'm actually going to pass the id as the key i'm also going to say the id goes through as a prop and then i'm gonna pass a prop called the chat name through so we're gonna say chat name equals chat name and then inside of sidebar chat this will take some props and then the props we're going to destructure and say get id and chat name and then instead of saying channel name this one will now say chat name like that and that should be pretty good okay now here what you should see is it's empty right this is good now when i click this icon over here i want to do a little prompt that gets popped up right so how do we do that so i'm going to go ahead and go to the icon i'm going to say on click right i'm going to create a function called add chat right and then i'm going to go ahead and create the function here when i say add chat and this is an anonymous function and what we do here is i go ahead and say db dot collection chats and basically what it's going to do is it's going to go ahead and add a chat right and remember we added the chat name and basically what i'm going to do is we need to collect like a popup should come up so right now if you see in this one we have a popup that comes up all right so it says please enter a chat name now hey atharva says the background music and the light somehow sink and like fire that's sick dude thank you so much uh thank you thank melbourne for that everyone went ahead and bought me that stuff so amazing stuff um so all the asynchronous stuff and promises are handled by firebase right sonny yes so firebase handle a lot of the sort of back end headache and the sort of sockets and stuff like that so you don't actually need to worry about a lot of that headache when you're doing this right so here we're going to go ahead and say const chat name equals prompt right and this prompts the user for an input and what we're going to say is please enter a chat name all right please enter a chat name and then what we're going to say is if there was a chat name so we're going to kind of protect the user if there's a chat room then we'll do this database call right and then we're going to basically go ahead and say say it to the chat name now this will actually go ahead should do it for us so now if i go ahead and click let's go ahead and say youtube boom real time that was sick and it worked in the first try hey my best friend jay's in the house sunny on a solo react video got a smash that like for a solo run amen brother that's it we're doing well we've got quite a few viewers still on we've got 243 people across youtube and facebook right now absolutely smashing it and also dude i don't know if you can see the lights upgrade the cell it's looking good man um there you go so you see we've got that we've got youtube and let's just go ahead and type in something like apple fans or let's just say papa react papa react squad there we go boom oh man oh i kind of went off a bit but you know it's fine um it's going to be responsive up to a certain degree um so that looks pretty good okay and then what we're going to say is we are going to go down to the uh so we've done that bit now so what i want to also do is i want to protect this against a sort of scrolling issue so i'm going to go into my sidebar.css and for the sidebar chats so inside of here so i'm going to go into my cybor.css now for sidebar chats we've actually already added the overflow okay that's good so we will protect if we do this but it gets sort of spammed right so right now it's room based this chat is going to be room based and the reason why i donate room based is because it's going to be easier to uh go ahead and have you guys interact with each other okay now why is it not fetching the photo so if you know it's inside the actual build this is the last person who've sent the message so in this case it'll be kazi and then if i go ahead and say yo what's up guys notice how it'll be me and it'll say yo what's up guy with my last timestamp there you go see that that's why it hasn't done it just yet so we need to implement this part the messages and then i can go ahead and connect the last message right here okay so what we're going to do now is i'm going to have it so when i click on one of these rooms i go ahead and dispatch some information into the redux store about what channel we're in so in order to do that first i'm going to go into my features i'm going to actually going to add a whole nother slice of state so i'm going to copy and paste my user slice i'm going to rename it to chat slice okay so chatsize.js and then here what i'm going to say is i'm going to go ahead and change user slice all of this stuff to chat i'm going to go over here and double check so chat chat in the beginning this is not going to be this is going to be chat id and it's going to be chat name right and then it's going to be um we're going to go ahead and say set chat right right there's only going to be one action and this one we need to export it so we can use it outside and then i'm going to go ahead and say when we get this action it's going to be state.chat id equals action.payload.chat id copy that line and i'm going to go ahead and refactor this to say chat name oh man i messed up i'll show you guys a quick trick come on d if i do chat name there we go boom save it uh oh to do that uh keyboard shortcut if you highlight a variable and you do command d you see it highlights all the possible ones when you get multiple cursors right so that's pretty sick and they'll allow you to be very fast with your coding now we have the set chat being exported so the next thing we want to do is actually go ahead and create selectors to pull that information so i'm going to make one called select chat name so select chat and the section i need just to select chat name and this goes into our state into the chat slice and it gets the chat name i'm going to copy and paste this and i'm going to go ahead and say select chat oops select chat id i'm going to go down here and say select chat id done right so this is looking pretty good right um so atharva says a man build with actual socket i o can also increase the possibilities and include functionality so you can do all of this dude with firebase so don't underestimate firebase um you can have all of that inside of firebase and it'll be a lot easier to build it um so you don't need to go ahead and like sort of overcomplicate by introducing one you you can introduce some ones that can do it that way and have like the skype functionality and things like that but you know only do what you kind of need to do unless at the point at which you need to do it so what i'm going to do is now connect this to the store so if i go into my store copy and paste there we go now we've got the user reducer right so here i'm going to change this to become so i'm going to change this oops i don't want to do that i'm going to go ahead and change this to become oh man overdone i'm going to go ahead and do user it's going to be the chat reducer and i'm going to copy paste and this one is going to be chat reducer chat reducer done right so loads of people saying why don't you upload react native tutorials because i'm literally dropping a react tutorial for you now dude i'm i'm trying to do as much as i can for you guys in terms of value based stuff also profit javascript is on fire right now we have a lot happening inside there so um yeah if you want to get the most from us make sure you subscribe make sure you hit the like button and just stay tuned we will be dropping as much content as you can possibly imagine so don't worry guys it's coming now to check that we've correctly linked up everything inside the db what i'm going to do is open up redux and we should see inside the state which is the user and we should see the new chat slice so if you get this you're pretty good at this point right so imran says hey sunny just amazing bro keep going appreciate that dude thank you so much um now what we're gonna do is for the i am a message so right now um i don't know why i'm not pulling the uh if i'll go ahead and say test uh oh yeah so right now actually if i go ahead and refresh you see it's not actually saving it because what we need to do is we need to go over here so if you actually go ahead and inspect and do the console i'll show you why because we haven't actually set up a firebase yet you see here you get this long could not reach for cloud firestore back end because we need to initialize it this is live right now it they said is this being premiered or live this is live cloud firestore we go here and then we're going to go ahead and say create database i'm going to start in test mode and i'm going to go ahead and click next i'm going to go ahead and do my about this enable this will go ahead and set up the firestore database so whoa man i'm not gonna read um holy okay right so now what we're gonna do is um so pedro to answer your question that's an arrow function the essex arrow function um same said just different syntax right right so so many people are saying at devtools is anything to see redux yes i literally just showed you guys so redux dev tools um you need to install the redux devtools but this is all redux right now this is relaxed actions this is redux state everything is redux yeah um thank you so much ronit he says oh nice my man that's freaking awesome really awesome content bro appreciate it thank you dude all right so now what i'm going to do is if we go ahead and add it in now so i'm just to visualize this for you guys i'm going to go ahead close this up and you guys are going to see now if i create a room and then i say like let's call it youtube enter and if i show you guys the firebase um so now i created a chat create the chat name youtube dope okay another one called cp team look at that you see in real time it created one called cp team right now if i was to go ahead and delete this one look on the right yeah in real time boom that's what you call snapshot that's the snapshot that's kicking in right so i'm going to go ahead and do another one so let's go ahead and say team cp because it sounds bad there we go created there boom but it's real time sync between the app and the back end so that's really powerful now we're gonna basically go ahead and create the messages okay so for the messages what we're to do is we're going to go to chat.js and here in chat.js right now we have everything hard coded okay so in order to fix this what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and inside the messages i'm actually going to create a message component right so the message component so here i'm going to go ahead and get rid of these and for the message component i need to create a message component it's also message.js rfce and then i'm going to go ahead and say import oops import message.css and then i'm going to go ahead and say message.css so if darva says i love the realtime function i'll let you firebase because you don't need to refresh the client to make the changes visible exactly and that's very important imagine you had an app which is saying when your order is ready you need to be able to go ahead and do that right so that's going to be very important and that's what firebase pretty much fixes for you outside out of the box um so very very powerful stuff um okay so then we're gonna go ahead and say uh for the message so each message is gonna take a uh two parameters right it's gonna take contents and it's gonna take uh so i'm gonna destruction i'm gonna take an idm and contents right and then the message itself is gonna be it's gonna have an avatar all right so i'm gonna go ahead and say avatar auto import from react material ui and then we're going to have a p tag with the message inside of it so this is a message uh jay good question dude he goes why not use module.css you can separate css for each component very good question and yes what that does is it prevents you from having naming clashes but for now what i would say is when when people are learning and things like that so yes module.css is really good um bem is just very quick for when i'm building also there is a benefit to them for example like if i go into my login right and i basically say i'm new to the programming like new to whatever i'm coding if i do command shift f and i do this it will actually give me the exact location of that and then it will actually find it in the css whereas if i was using uh module.css it's kind of difficult but it's not difficult by it the truth is module.css is better yes but bem is a really good naming convention to to practice and it gets you very good at it basically breaks the bad habit of naming and then i would say progress to module.css so really really good um question bro uh aegis says let's go nice keep the energy high awesome stuff thank you i guess um right so this is a message and then we're gonna go ahead and create a small tag and here i'm gonna have a timestamp okay and then i'm gonna go back to my chat and then here i'm gonna import message from the top so there we go you can see this is a message right now i'm going to go ahead and paste this a few times we should have three messages popping out nice now inside the message i'm going to go ahead and pull out message.css i'm going to pull this underneath and then i'm going to go ahead and pull out my message so i can see here right now for the message i'm going to say dot message uh oh yeah some people had a comment them inside there inside the return block i remember that um display flex uh save it and everything goes into a row you don't see it because this needs to be class name message there we go and then i'm going to say align item center because it should go in the center i'll say position relative because we're going to do some absolute positioning inside of it with another component i'm going to say width should be fit content because we only want the bubble to be as big as it needs to be i say justify content space between because i want it to be sort of spaced out as much as it can be i'll say margin of 15 pixels so around remember margins outside the component uh padding is inside the component now the next thing okay the next thing we're going to do is we're going to say the message and then target the p tag inside right so the p tag inside there we go and i'm going to add a background color font size medium padding 15 pixels border radius 20 to get that rounded effect margin 10 pixels to add some more separation around the back around it and then a margin right pushes it all the way to the side okay for this one now what i'm also going to do is target that small tag i'm going to say go ahead and target small tag gray position absolute but because the parent is relative it actually goes ahead and stays relative to its parent and then it's bottom minus five and this goes ahead and adds a little timestamp like this so very clean right now what if i want to have it so that we have a sender as well so we'll figure out the sender afterwards so the blue message so if you send the message you want to be this side blue so i'm going to show you guys how to do that in just a bit but right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to have it so that when you enter it's actually going to go ahead and send a message into this right now okay so let's go ahead and do that first so the way we do that is firstly i need to have a keep track of all the messages coming in so inside of chat.js what i'm going to do is i'm going to say const messages set messages equals use state okay and then i'm going to do this and then i'm going to go ahead and say um right so before we do this actually what we need to do is we need to fix a problem we need to fix one so i need to have it so when i click one of these it changes this to the channel right so if i click on the sidebar let's go to the sidebar dot js we have to solve this issue first so cyborg.js what i'm going to do now is have it so that when i click on the sidebar chat component so inside the sidebar chat component i should have it so when i click on that it goes ahead and dispatches an action so i'm going to show you guys how you can do this with an inline function so here i'm going to say on click i'm going to do an inline function and i'm going to say dispatch and i'm going to say dispatch and we'll do the imports and stuff afterwards i'm going to say set chat so this is a action that we set up earlier inside the app inside the chat slice and this will actually go ahead and take the chat id which is the id we passed in as a prop and it's also going to set the chat name as the chat name as a prop which came in as prop this means that we basically go ahead and set this up inside of our redux store so that way we can access it outside of any other place right so here i'm going to say const dispatch sorry dispatch equals use dispatch import it get rid of this boom um cesar says it's amazing how you know what you need to do step by step i understand how to do it myself with the project from scratch by scratch because i get lost by myself thank you sonny it just takes practice dude i remember in the beginning i used to be like freaking out and like panicking everywhere it just takes practice you'll get used to it honestly don't stress man uh just don't give up that's my main advice um i just broke something um line 13 oh yeah chat name boom boom all right one second guys we've got this we got this dispatch an object that's the end of the dispatch that's the end of this okay unexpected error god damn it there's always some kind of error when we when we do this stuff so let me go ahead and check something quickly the dispatch save it boom okay and then we've got the dispatch itself we've got the set chat we've got the id okay this is because of the following okay there we go and then i'm gonna say const dispatch equals use dispatch these brackets are ruining the show honestly dude yeah it's sometimes the bracket just piss me off man yeah so it comes dispatch there you go and then what i'm going to say is const chat info equals search envelope so this will be important for afterwards actually but we'll do that later so set chat is not defined line 13 this is because we need to go ahead and import this action we set that up earlier inside of our chat slice and redux and now what this should do is when i do this it will dispatch an action in redux so if i go down here you should see look so fresh piece of state so if i click team cp it goes ahead and sets the chat and it changes the chat name so remember by the way changes the chat name to team cp and chat id to the chat id right if i click on youtube it changes it so dispatch an action change the name to youtube and the chat id to the id that's based inside of firebase now that's very important because we're going to use that afterwards to go ahead and fetch the correct messages for this component so it's very it's very cleverly connected right so once that's done now what we can do is we can go ahead and actually pull that information in at the top right so we go ahead and go to our um let's go to uh chat.js and inside of chat.js now what i can do is i can use my selector so i can say go ahead and say chat name equals use selector i could say select chat name and i can pull this in and that's a special import so let's pull it in over there and then what we can say is rather than having channel name set over here i can actually go ahead and say channel name and now it says channel name is not the file oh sorry chat name chat name goddammit yeah somebody said yeah jay said you missed an open bracket yeah i know they found it in the end so now if we click youtube team tp hey see it changes at the top and we also have access to the id right so now what i'm going to have um awesome and you know foreign how did you manage programming fitness and lifestyle also dude ask nicely okay when you're at 22 25 uh 22 to 25 age um how do what you mean how did you manage you just do it man just do it stop complaining or finding excuses you literally just make it happen like if i don't really know the question like how did you manage to do that at that age like what's stopping you from doing it at that age that's what you need to kind of reset your your sort of mindset around it um okay so then what we're going to go ahead and do is have it load the appropriate messages right so this is going to take a twostep process so the first one is we go into our chat.js and we need to create a piece of state for the messages to keep track of what's going on so messages set messages okay and i'm going to say use state this is going to be an empty array um says how are you sunny i'm good dude how are you sorry if i pronounced the name wrong um yeah we're going to create a user fact all right i'm also going to get the chat id so i'm going to say const chat id equals use selector use selector and we'll say select chat id right right so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go here and then i'm to go ahead and say so that's all working well now the chat id is there so now i'm going to go to the use effect and basically use effect again there's a piece of code that fires off once when the checkpoint loads and also whenever a dependency inside these square brackets changes for example in this case we need this to refresh every time the chat id changes because i'm going to need the chat id here so i'm going to say if a chat id was selected so we only get selects one when i click on one of these options then i would populate the store with a chat id when that happens i'm going to go ahead and say db dot collection db.collection i'm going to go inside of um hey tzuyler says i think i'm going to be on this channel from now on nice dude appreciate that so we're going to say db.collection chat and then we'll say doc and then the doc is going to be the chat id right so we're actually going to go into that chat and then we're going to say go into the collection inside of that chat and access the messages so essentially what we're doing is we're going inside the chat room so inside that inside this chat room we're going to go inside the collection of messages and then i'm going to say order by because we're actually going to set up a timestamp so i'll say order by a timestamp and then i'm going to say order by a descending timestamp so that'll be for a bit afterwards um jay says handling the chat and coding a goddamn imessage from scratch at the same time it's not an easy feat pure talent appreciate that dude and then what we're going to say is on snapshot right now snapshot is something that we do when we want to get a realtime feedback so if anything changes inside the db so we're going to use set messages so the hook and then we're going to go ahead and say snapshot.docs.map and then we're going to say doc right now for every single dock that comes back i'm going to map it to a object and this is going to map to the doc.id and also the data god's sake i hate that thing data dot dot data okay so i was like like that and what this is going to do is i know that might be a like a mouthful right here but what this is doing is it's basically when i click on this it's finding this inside the db this room all the collec the messages inside of collection there's grabbing them and storing them inside of the messages array okay um go back and sing says this is this is amazing attended it for the first time thank you so much dude um yeah glad you guys are enjoying this and again we're almost at 700 likes right jugutha says wow sunny is the best in react thanks i learned a lot from you appreciate that dude thank you so much for the kind words um let's keep on going strong okay so now what we're gonna do is we have the messages coming back right so here rather than having the messages hardcoded i'm gonna say for all of the messages go ahead and map through them and for each message i wanna render out an implicit return so an implicit message return and then we're going to go ahead and say render out a message and in that message should have a key with the id and here i'm going to destructure the what comes back for every message i'm going to get the id and the data and then we're going to pass in the contents of the message and that's going to be the data and the id is going to be the key okay and that will be that and then save it and now you should see if i click it that's pretty i know it doesn't look good but it is correct it's working trust me on that it's working right um you dating says i love you man you're great uh we have a sauron saying i love it sure up says um you're one of the best cheers of react after bad love from pakistan thank you so much dude um set messages and on snapchat in one command until now they were separate yeah it's really really powerful to write like that right so the next thing we're going to do now is this is actually sort of when i click this it's going ahead and fetching it right so it's fetching the messages but we need a way to push messages inside right now so i'm going to go ahead and do that as well so right now earlier we set up the input map we mapped the input sort of piece of state to our input field over here and then we had it map on the on change so as i type in down here pretty much goes ahead and stores it inside of our local state now when we we create a send message we said e dot prevent default to prevent the refreshing from happening and then we said firebase magic so this is where the firebase magic happens right so i'm gonna go ahead and say db.collection i'm gonna go back into the chats right the collection of chats i'm gonna go into the doc dock and the dock here is gonna be the chat id and then i'm gonna say go into the collection of messages all right and then what i'm gonna say is add right so go into connection messages and then i'm going to say add and at this point what we do is we pretty much go ahead and add what we need so we're going to add a timestamp now the timestamp is going to be different for everyone for example if you're in india or if you're in la if you're in new york your timestamps can be different to me in london so what i need to do is i need to go ahead to the top and say import firebase from firebase okay so import firebase from firebase not the local one the actual firebase and here i'm going to say firebase.first right which is a function i'm going to say field value no window function so we're going to say field value and then i'm going to say server server timestamp and that's a function this will go ahead and give me the time of the actual server so that way even if you sent it based in london even if you sent this and um hey ismail saying london baby thanks for doing this on a friday night it's a good way to end your friday night nice guys awesome stuff um bala ganesh says thank you so much um for providing the valuable information keep inspiring and motivating us thank you so much dude um messed up the camera a little bit there um but then we've got the time stamp so regardless of where you're based in um nice he says dude i see you in the projects more than anything else during my day i don't give up do you know already what the next project will be react nate have a bunch of stuff happening we've got loads of stuff coming guys just keep subscribed and keep an eye on my instagram go ahead and follow me uh over here if you're not following me to keep track of when we drop the latest and greatest videos okay so message here i'm gonna say input and then i'm also to give uid and this one is going to be user so again and now i need the user's information so the message contents are going to be here we're going to pull that from the input okay but i need the user who actually sent the message so in order to do that i'm going to get the user i'm going to say select use selector sorry use selector and then i'm going to say select user so this is my select user and then i'm going to go ahead and make sure this is import okay we've already imported it um so soham thank you so much for the kind words bonjour attacks enjoying it nice stuff guys um so i'm gonna go ahead and save that and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and have it so that it pushes the um we've got the message here but i've also wanted a bunch of other things i want the uid the photo the email the display name all from the user item right so what i do is i go uid equals user.uid so remember when you log in we populate the user inside the redux store we just use the selector to go ahead and grab it from the redux store which gives us the user object and that's how we go ahead and get the user that we're going to push in for every single object that also gives us the photo okay now borax says you're like a magician thank you dude appreciate it um good positivity right um i love this because i don't find it coincidence on my motivation i've just told me don't give up on something you can't stop thinking about every single day exactly exactly keep doing what you love right so that with that said now what we actually have is a really nice really nice system which should be working okay so let's go ahead and check it out so firstly i'm also going to go ahead and update the message itself before we do that so everything should come in clutch and work together right so first thing i'm going to do is the contents actually have a bunch of things inside of it so uh my girlfriend is obsessed with proper react do you know do you guys know who papa react is who the heck is proper react hey i love her honestly and she goes i miss him she guys she misses out on time with me for these streams so smash the thumbs up button right and uh and show some love and support for that all right so over here i'm going to say content i'm going to destructure right jay goes oh the og arrives this is where it comes up um she goes guys show some love he's doing so well let's tap that like button guys we're at 660 likes can we get to 700 i think so i think so right um so now i'm gonna go ahead and destructure the contents right so over here i'm gonna say timestamp when i say display name i'm gonna say email so i'm breaking it apart the object right now i'm gonna say message photo and uid right uid save it and then it says line seven is an error no what do i do yeah i need to close this and then oh what the hell happened here so we've got this boom boom there we go all right um i think we can get to 700 likes i think we can uh petition to get marvin next to sunny's uh in the next video a hundred percent i think we can get that one in this video i'll teach you how to code guys we can do that right um and that'll be awesome uh and the one here is actually papa and no we don't talk about angular here guys we hate that all right so uh yes papa and mama together yeah she's gonna be mama react guys so get her on the channel early we're actually gonna have a we're actually thinking of starting a youtube channel together so that would be fun um right now guys with that said now the avatar the source for the avatar is actually going to be the photo that comes through right so the photo that we destruction uh there we go um so inspiring man love from bangladesh by the way where are you from sunny london dude based and born in london right now for the p tag i'm gonna say this is a message rather than that one actually dropped a dynamic message just being pulled in um then we're gonna go ahead and say uh timestamp so for the timestamp you need to do some clever passing right so i'm gonna go ahead and drop a snippet in here and i'll explain what it does it says create a new date from the timestamp optional training protects it against because there are times where it's asynchronous and it's pretty much gonna have a uh it's gonna have an undefined value so you protect yourself with optional training you say pass it to a date and then you're gonna basically go ahead and format it to a locale string uh so we can go ahead and save that and i know it seems like oh my god he's doing so much but it will make sense in a second right uh bonjour tech says you guys are great colors and are great humans nice family appreciate that dude thank you so much um this would be dope next video teaching about coding and how to go by damn wouldn't that be fun more like melbourne bar going code and learn with me react from papa wrap from scratch so basically teaching up from scratch yeah i think that'll be fun honestly um rzo says you are the best program in the world thanks brother for this helpful information i appreciate that dude um i'm glad you're enjoying the stream all right so now what we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and have the email so uh the final piece right here so i'm going to actually go ahead and say we're going to test it right now right so if we if this works right this is where it gets tense right if this works right so i haven't actually gone ahead and sort of checked everything out but if this next bit works i want everyone to smash the thumbs up button and get this video to 700 likes all right so i think what we need to do is uh we need to go ahead and get ready for this right because i'm gonna pretty much i haven't tested this i'm just gonna go ahead and see if it works in one go we change so much code right now and i think it's gonna work right i think it's gonna work but you know how these things happen all right so i'm gonna go to message i'm signed in right and then we're gonna go ahead and say yo this works you think dot dot dot all right so suspense right everything's gonna happen as soon as i hit enter on this is it gonna work right all right see how it goes albiola says the best programmer i have ever seen jay goes let's go ottawa's already coming in with the suspense music right i think we can do it i'm going to hit enter and we can see if it's going to work hey see what and look at that guys it pulled my picture in and it pulled the message in even has a correct time stamp right so that's pretty sick right everything works like that and now if i go ahead and just say like abc one two three that's that boom works nice right so that's though we've got everything working i think we should all go ahead and hit that thumbs up if you haven't already alright again i think we're gonna hit 700 very soon so that's dope guys now what we're gonna do is actually have it so that if you're the sender then it's gonna go ahead and make it that blue message so it's gonna be like this right if you're the sender it's gonna show you a blue message um so we're gonna go ahead and do that right now so inside of message dot css i'm going to go ahead and add the following logic so right now we have message over here so i'm going to create this into a more i'm going to do string interpolation here i'm going to say if the user.email so i need to go ahead and actually pull the user in so i need to say const user equals use selector select user all right um yeah yeah and then what we're going to say now is we're going to say user if the user's email is equal to the email address that comes in i change it to the other music because it's easier to focus with that one all right then we're going to go ahead and have uh yeah so this is no the question mark is if else that's if else what we're about to use right now but the question mark down here um is actually saying optional chaining so if this for any reason is undefined it doesn't crash the program it just handles it uh elegantly so it's coming something called optional chaining very very elegant solution to use um but here what we're going to do is we're actually using we're using tannery here so actually we're not going to use tennis we're going to use a direct right but with the ternary you can say if it's true then say this else say this right so that's the ternary but what we're going to do is we're going to do a direct sort of conditional so we're going to say here apply the message sender class if the user's email is equal to the email of the message right go ahead and save that and let's go ahead and refresh some reason that's not refreshing there we go and now if i go ahead and click into this for example the youtube chat it loads up the youtube message and if i go ahead and say this is a test now you guys can also see if i go into different channels it pulls those messages which is dope right so let's go into message.css hey we got ecuador in the house nice sup dude and then here what we're gonna say is i'm gonna add a few style tricks in so what i'm gonna first say is that if the message sender if the message sender class exists set the margin all the way to the right right then what we're going to say is that if the message sender is existing what i'm going to do is i'm going to target the message photo and i'm going to use a rule called order one and this is basically going to change the flex order of the children so the image will now go ahead of the child so in this case if i do that and i say message photo by default is message is order zero what this will do is if we want to get this effect right so we have the message on this side and the message on here so the way we do that is i can refresh we actually haven't set something up correctly here so we've got the message sender then we need to do a message photo because inside of here i haven't done a class name of message photo now if we do that and refresh boom works there we go all right so now it's the sender and also i'm going to change the color of the message sender so i'm going to go ahead and do this oh we almost we're 10 likes away from 700 likes guys let's go come on we can do this right so we're going to go ahead and target the message sender p tag and we're going to say if you're a sender then it turns blue so now it does this right so i'm going to test this i'm going to log out of my account go into sign in and i'm going to go ahead and check now i'm going to go into qazi's account and let's go ahead and see and if i go here now so that now i'm not the sender because it's not kazzy's email address but if i go into here and i say like what's up guys enter boom so now the sender is going to get the blue message but somebody else is going to have not have it right 5 legs away let's go um dope right so that works really good okay now the next step and the final step is actually going ahead and adding two things one adding the animations which will be very quick and two uh i thought because if we do not have seven hundred maybe we'll attack sunny goddammit help me out guys get four more likes and get hashtag fancy dinner going you know um so what we're gonna do now is also have the message come up here right inside our chat so in order to do that what we need to do is go into our sidebar chat and we have the um i need to create a piece of state and this is going to be the information that we're going to show here so i'm gonna call it uh chat info okay so i need to go ahead and import this um and there we go and then what i'm gonna go ahead and do is drop a use effect right so i'm gonna go ahead and say drop a use effect here and this goes like that and what we're going to have is we're going to have the id right so id uh oh my god 699 likes hey there we go nice guys thank you so much for that 700 likes on this video that's insane love the energy you guys have had today honestly it's picked up as the videos going on and is it like it's been it's been a quality livestream okay so amazing stuff hashtag fancy dinner all right that's all we're talking about guys nice okay and then the likes keep going up that's what i like to see man that's what i like to see right so the next thing we're gonna do is where we have the use effect i'm gonna go ahead and say db dot collection and then i'm going to go ahead and say go inside the chats and i'm going to say go inside the doc id and then i'm going to go ahead and say collection of messages and if you guys aren't already following me on instagram go ahead and follow me my tag is under my picture right now uh i'd love to go ahead and chat to you guys on there so that'll be awesome to go and see you guys i'm going to order by timestamp and i'm going to do descending okay and then i'm going to do on snapshot to get the real time functionality so on snapshot and then i'm going to go ahead and say snapshot so when we get that snapshot go ahead and update the the state so set chat info and set the chat info to snapshot dot docs dot map every single doc all right um hey you guys are dropping some nice comments man thank you so much miss carb uh thank you so much imran we've got loads of people dropping uh lots of positivity this is amazing stuff um something i'll be waiting on the fanciness or instead with the one and only my mumbo yeah we'll be going to a fancy dinner don't worry about that um right so back to serious stuff right we're gonna go ahead and map doctor data like this and then we're gonna go ahead and thank you so much dutch american he says excellent speaker i appreciate that dude um so now we we should actually have the chat info inside of here um inside of our in our local state right and then the id is dependent so we need to include that here so with that said now what i'm also going to do is i'm going to go down here and where we have the chat here so what all i need to do is get the last message that was sent so inside of chat info i'm going to access the zero element right which is basically the first element and i say go get the message of that right and also with the timestamp i'm going to do the same thing so that's that's sort of interesting interesting is the only way i can really say it um oh nice dude we got a big donation just come in 200 um mexican pesos thanks for explaining papa react moses alejandro uh alejandro shares hernandez thank you so much dude appreciate the donation and and really really nice stuff thank you so much man um congrats so you're on the 700th birthday yeah it's always a birthday man we get that stuff going um i'll drop this on my channel i'll try something like this on my channel i'll be cool um okay so we're going to go ahead and in the small tag i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm going to include some i'm going to say new chat info 0 timestamp today and then we're going to pass it now you can see guys look at this if i go ahead and change it to like one two three boom one two three has the latest time stamp and and then the one thing we need to fix is the avatar right so the source for the avatar i'm going to go ahead and do the same thing i'm going to say here it's going to be chat info 0 and we're doing optional change to protect against the break and then now we should see so kazi was the last one that sent the message here and then i was the last one that sent a message here which is why my picture but if i say yo i'm taking over i'm taking over the sidebar boom there you go nice cause it's richer all right so that's dope that's amazing it's working as we want it right so what we're gonna do now is have some fancy animations in so the way we can do that is um uh somebody says so something can you pause the music when you do live streams it kind of kills about i i really i don't know man i really enjoy the vibe uh the the music and i think loads of people actually enjoy the music so i kind of go based off of what everyone's enjoying what everyone's feeling you know that sort of stuff um my girlfriend just texted me saying they want me in the vid hell yeah we're gonna bring you in the vid um so now what we're to do is we're going to go ahead and actually add the animations in so you can see right now um so right now see this is the final finishing touch this nice little animation right here okay amazing donation thank you so much shashank he says what cp doing is amazing thank you guys thank you so much brother for that donation i appreciate you also if i go ahead and type in here say hello you see that it kind of pops in in a very nice animated fashion so in order to do that what we're gonna do now is yeah so these t spoilers like no don't don't kill the music i say i'm gonna kill it dude don't worry uh so i'm gonna add something called react flip move so i'm gonna go ahead and say react flip move and i'm gonna go here to effortless animation and i'm going to show you guys how to implement very easy animations right so we need to go ahead and install it so i'm going to go in to bring up the terminology npm i react flip move um you don't need the dash s anymore and then what i'm going to say is we're going to go down here and you see there's a good documentation for this but all we need to do essentially is add a forward ref to our message that's the first thing so i'm going to go to my message and i'm going to change this function to an es6 function first i'm going to say const message equals and i'm changing this to an arrow function so it's the same thing but it's just written in the es6 way so this is the es6 way of writing a function okay and then what we're going to do is here's his mouth says play some 690 can you imagine trying to go to that that'd be tricky man all right so i'm going to go ahead and add forward ref and then i'm going to go ahead and do parentheses go all the way down here and add the closing parenthesis and then you've got the after the destructuring i'm going to do comma and i'm going to pull a ref out of it right and then what what that means is we pull the ref away from this bit and then we go into our div and we basically say ref equals ref now as for what this does you don't need to say i'm going to explain what forward ref is at this point but you need to import it um this is pretty much gonna it's gonna allow your your sort of just think of it this way it's gonna allow your functional components to be able to communicate the way that they need to for the animation to play correctly okay that's all we need to know at this point so that's successfully installed uh we don't need that anyway then we're gonna go back to our chat.js and where we render out the messages all we need to do is wrap this entire div inside of the flip move so flip move component because now we've done that correctly so it's going to freak out and i'm going to go back here and you see it's saying right flip move is not fine so i need to import react flip move react flip move i'm going to go ahead and import that react flip move from react flip move and now guys check this out boom animations you need keys though you need keys in your messages otherwise it messes this entire thing up it doesn't know which is what then but now if i go inside and say hello boom check that out guys yo it works look how smooth that is that's dope i just want to check if my overflow is fixed so i'm just going to do say abc and i'm going to copy this a bunch of times let's do abc oh okay i guess we could do an important reaction move from here okay so you see this right now it breaks right there's no see overflow doesn't it doesn't work correctly right we don't want this to happen okay so how do we fix this overflow issue right so let's go ahead and fix this so let's go ahead and go to our chat.css and here what we want to do so inside of chat.css where we have chat messages i'm going to go ahead and firstly add overflow scroll okay now by adding that you can see we have actually already fixed a lot of the issue but i want to kind of hide the scroll bars right so in order to do that now what i'm going to do is i'm going to add these two snippets we've seen them before i'm reusing them here so these two the first one does it for chrome safari and oprah the second one does it for internet explorer edge and firefox um but it basically removes the look and feel so if i go ahead and save it it removes the look and feel but it actually keeps the functionality of the scroll bar okay so that's dope and it works really really nice really really well so with that said now what we're going to go ahead and do is um so if you want to go ahead and make it to time ago i would recommend this go ahead and extend on it but you can pretty much use the moment or time ago library um that's going to be something pretty cool um we can actually go ahead and just check quickly i think it's time ago uh jess just moment you get loads you get time ago.js this one's pretty decent i've used this one before um see you see this is just now four minutes ago things like that um should we just quickly do let's just do it go on then let's do it i'm gonna do npm install timeago.js and then let's go ahead and see how you can do it so import all as time ago and then let's go ahead and check out how we use it so i haven't used this in a while so it'll be interesting so sidebar sidebar chat and then we have where we have the timestamps over here what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say import at the top import all from time ago at some time ago suggest you can also do a moment i think so i'm just using the quick one that i saw but you can do it moment moments really good one two at some moment that's what we're gonna do time ago um dot format oops i'm gonna format i'm gonna basically pop this in now i'm not sure if that will work just like that pretty much go ahead and see so look at that four weeks ago okay that's not right um it hasn't done that right so if i go to to locale string let's go ahead and see if this one works oh there we go nice look at that two minutes ago if i go ahead and say yo boom just now fast though dude that's sick we got that working pretty quick and now this one says six minutes ago if i go ahead and said uh when was this pushed just now right and that's sick and that would change um as and when sort of like the timings change and things like that um i think uh moment is actually a lot better i think i would use a moment um but yeah you can pretty much use whatever you decide to do because you see now this one doesn't actually refresh in real time but i mean it's not bad like isn't this actually not bad like um but i would like the one that does dynamics so i would actually go recommend uh time ago moment.js moment.js i think i prefer moment.js um they have a much better way of doing it at a moment.js so i think it's from now yeah you see from now is the one that i would have used preferably but it's fine yeah um so yeah so this one the reason why i've done this guys and had it reversed like this is because you need to have a listener then which scrolls to the bottom always so i'm not going to do that today otherwise it's just a little bit unnecessary extra work i want to show you the deployment instead so we can prioritize that right what i would say is you can pretty much go ahead and just if you want to do that you go to chat.js and you literally just change it to um ascending firstly and then you have it so that you always have a scroll listener so every time the user sends a message it will scroll to the bottom as that way it kind of locks to the bottom every time you send a message that's what that's how you do that by the way um so yeah um so now what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say firebase init right so in order to do this you need to have firebase setup so firebase tools so you might need to globally install firebase tools but what i'm going to do now is go ahead and do firebase init and i'm going to spacebar on hosting and then i'm going to use an existing project right so i'm going to go ahead and find the build that i've done so you see we have so many builds and imessage clone youtube hit that and what then what you want to go ahead and do is go ahead and do oops go ahead and do public directory i'm going to say build right so not you don't care enter you has to be build all right build is very important here and then once we do this we're going to click y because it's a single page app every react app is a single page app then what we need to do is say npm run build so now we're going to deploy this live right so npm run build and then i'm going to basically go ahead so that's good if i run that it basically creates an optimized production build okay optimize production build and that will go ahead and make it very very fast and sort of and it'll be very very nice and easy to go ahead and do that so um optimized production build is gonna get so it strips out all the things that dev devtools the things that you don't need on the deployed version of the website that's what happens when you when you use this okay so you need to go ahead and do this and now it's important to know whenever you do npm run build if you make any changes after you're gonna need to go ahead and do npm run build again to get the optimized build now checking inside of our build folder so as we now should see a build photo with all the stuff inside of it you don't want to ever touch the build folder the command line builds everything for you and puts it inside of that but what we want to do now is say firebase deploy if it's not a single page we can use hash router and deploy you don't even need to use that you can just react router to make it multiple pages so a lot of the builds including the amazon clone on the react challenge if you use a react route or inside that we use reactor inside that build to have multiple pages inside the app that will do it but here you can say firebase deploy and guys who is ready to deploy this thing if you're ready let me know uh we've pretty much got this thing built but i want to go ahead and have everyone jump on this app and get this thing deployed and up and running so let me know in the comments if you are excited and if you are and you haven't already done so smash the thumbs up on button and let me know if i should hit this deployment button okay so let me know right now my finger is here right all i have to do is let you just drop and we can pretty much go ahead and deploy this thing live and it's so fast i'm going to drop that in the chat and everyone's going to go ahead and be able to use this and go ahead and see the realtime functionality of this right so we have a miracle says let's go uh jay says get that fire build online so we can experience it pranav says ready for sure everyone is ready bonjour says uh pumped super ready and pumped let's go ahead and do it uh daniel graham is saying push that button let's go ahead and do it guys i'm gonna go ahead and hit the enter key and you can see it's pretty much going to go ahead and spin it up so it's deploying hosting and as soon as that's done it's uploading the new files and see how long it takes and hey there we go here it is guys go ahead and check this out right now i'm gonna drop it inside of the chat go ahead log in with your your accounts and pretty much go and check out this build right now keep it clean please keep it clean uh and while you guys do that i'm gonna be showing some amazing comments on the screen let me see if we start seeing some people pushed inside hey we still start seeing people coming in nice look we got some people coming in youtube love we've got stuff coming in here look at that let's go lots of love nice guys that's good job man so because we got loads of people adding channels it's changing the channels which is fine and go youtube love team cp go ahead and play around with it so you've got boom angus great work sonny there we go see let's go ahead and chat so here we can see yo team cp oh man this is i mean keep it clean guys come on but yeah that's how we do it guys so we have pretty much gone ahead and built out the entire clone for you guys right so that means that we went ahead and covered things like react in this build we have redux behind the entire build we have firebase behind the build it's using material ui this was a dope dope build and it was an awesome uh i had some awesome energy with you guys today like everyone just got that energy kind of ramped up as the build went on uh i thought it was so much fun to go ahead and do this uh this was an amazing build and guys stay tuned and if you haven't already the first link in the description is a three hour free netflix training webinar that me and kazia put together you guys can go ahead and check that out make sure you sign up to it right now and if you haven't already smash the thumbs up button so everyone can go ahead and benefit from the value that this um live stream went ahead and dropped this video will be available online now so make sure you go ahead and and you can pretty much go ahead and replay it at your own time build this add this to your portfolio and i just want to say again thank you so much guys for watching the live streams i will be dropping more content and i will be more active on this channel i'll also be active on my channel i'm going to be dropping some content over there but with that said guys i love and appreciate every single one of you check out the blog that atharva posted i thought i would go ahead and drop that in the comment section but with that said guys as always i love and appreciate every single one of you and i will see all of you in the next video peace
