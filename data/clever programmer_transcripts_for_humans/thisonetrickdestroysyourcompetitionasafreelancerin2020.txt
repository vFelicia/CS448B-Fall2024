00:11 - oh this is actually holy crap this is
00:14 - actually your real message to me the
00:16 - first one
00:17 - actual first one yep yep there was a
00:20 - kind of um
00:20 - a little proposal that goes with it but
00:22 - this was the cover letter so this is
00:23 - what i sent to try and
00:24 - stand out when i saw your your the job
00:26 - application and now you've been working
00:28 - with us for what
00:30 - two point uh first
00:33 - ever message uh and now this is so
00:37 - cool this is so cool you guys like the
00:39 - fact that and now she's been working
00:40 - with us for two
00:41 - and a half years at cp that's insane
00:46 - like that is one of the coolest things i
00:47 - mean nobody i've never seen a training
00:49 - like this
00:50 - like this is so cool that we can talk
00:51 - about this
00:53 - it's crazy right yeah that is insane
00:56 - go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks
00:57 - to how much power there is in
00:59 - um just really putting some effort into
01:03 - the right kind of job application or
01:05 - whatever whatever way that you're
01:06 - reaching out to people
01:07 - putting some thought into it doing your
01:09 - research on who the other person is um
01:12 - really taking your time and especially
01:14 - on platforms like at work you see a lot
01:16 - of
01:16 - copy and pastes yes you know oh my god
01:18 - people just
01:21 - they just apply for this every all these
01:22 - jobs with the same thing it doesn't
01:24 - speak to
01:24 - your own application to the skills to
01:26 - the character which if you can just take
01:28 - that time to really
01:29 - um really hone in on what they're asking
01:32 - for
01:33 - yeah um because i mean all the time to
01:36 - your point i would get these like
01:37 - garbage messages on upwork and just like
01:40 - hey really interesting project you have
01:43 - there
01:44 - i could definitely help you and then
01:46 - blah blah and i'm like
01:47 - that's your what 104th copy paste of the
01:50 - day
01:51 - you know yeah and so when i saw a
01:54 - message like
01:55 - yours it was extremely refreshing to see
01:58 - somebody who actually
01:59 - read what we had written and wrote
02:02 - specifically for that
02:04 - so like what rachel is saying is like
02:06 - guys stop
02:07 - using canned
02:10 - messages when you reach out to these
02:12 - platforms it's not a game of volume it's
02:14 - a game of like
02:15 - reaching out with quality yeah yeah oh
02:18 - totally totally um and i want to even
02:21 - read out your message because i think
02:22 - it's really important you guys could
02:23 - even use this as a template
02:25 - so rachel reached down and she said hi
02:28 - there and she goes
02:29 - i really enjoyed reading your job
02:31 - posting and it would be awesome to chat
02:34 - with you about whether i'd be a good fit
02:35 - for the role honestly when i read this i
02:38 - thought it was like
02:39 - a canned message probably you know most
02:42 - likely
02:43 - because that's what i got from a lot of
02:44 - people but then this is where i got
02:46 - interested
02:47 - i love problem solving and getting tech
02:49 - tools to work together
02:51 - my background is ten years in
02:52 - accountancy and admin but six months ago
02:55 - i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal
02:57 - work is in problem solving
02:59 - so here she said problem solving love
03:02 - problem solving
03:03 - in my initial job posting i had
03:06 - mentioned
03:07 - problem solving multiple times um yeah i
03:10 - think i've popped the post a little
03:11 - further down as well because so it's
03:13 - there in case yeah
03:14 - oh yeah that's awesome we can actually
03:15 - take a look at that too
03:18 - um oh wow even amanat is
03:21 - he's like um he's this letter is amazing
03:23 - i've never thought of writing a letter
03:25 - like that
03:25 - finally wishing him good this is awesome
03:28 - so
03:28 - here um so i've got experience in
03:31 - leadpages and various email webinar
03:33 - payment course systems
03:35 - these specific systems we were talking
03:37 - about
03:38 - but not kajabi and this is honestly one
03:41 - of those things that kind of just like
03:42 - hits you in the heart like this was one
03:44 - of the things where i'm like
03:46 - not only do we not have somebody who's
03:49 - possibly
03:49 - really good at it but the fact that she
03:53 - says openly she doesn't know kajabi
03:56 - and not like some wishy-washy
03:59 - answer like literally she's like not
04:01 - kajabi
04:03 - that is huge because already i can tell
04:06 - so much about her
04:07 - character and integrity and i want to
04:10 - work with somebody on the team who has
04:12 - character and integrity
04:14 - i don't want to work with people who put
04:17 - politics
04:18 - above everything else right
04:21 - so going on and she goes yet i'm really
04:24 - keen to learn all of these systems so
04:25 - that's important to me that she's very
04:27 - flexible
04:29 - and so would be very happy in my element
04:31 - in fact to learn them
04:33 - quickly and on my own time like that is
04:36 - just
04:37 - beautifully written it's like somebody's
04:39 - dream to have somebody like that working
04:41 - on their team
04:42 - where they're like hey i would i don't
04:45 - know them this is actually funny right
04:47 - because
04:47 - at the start of this video that's what i
04:50 - said
04:50 - if you don't know it just say it and say
04:52 - i'll be able to willing to learn later
04:54 - literally what you say here and um
04:58 - we have messages that are like joseph
05:00 - says
05:01 - this is a working template nice one
05:03 - rachel
05:04 - o'shea says rachel's letter is perfect
05:07 - it's brief
05:08 - specific and detailed really good job
05:12 - so lucy says this is so
05:15 - useful hassan says eloquent
05:19 - amazing job says amanath abdullah says
05:22 - yeah rachel
05:23 - amazing job no thanks guys
05:26 - yeah seriously it's actually really
05:28 - amazing and then she goes i love
05:30 - research and have found some great
05:32 - resources so i can
05:33 - quickly get familiar with them i pride
05:35 - myself in being proactive a strong
05:37 - communicator and a great team player
05:40 - honestly this statement i trust if
05:43 - anybody else says it i would just ignore
05:45 - it
05:45 - but like do you guys know what makes me
05:49 - want to trust this statement more like
05:52 - what
05:52 - out of this entire thing what was it
05:55 - that makes me actually trust this
05:57 - statement
05:57 - more and if you want to guess drop it in
06:00 - the comments below but for me
06:02 - it was actually this statement where she
06:04 - just openly is so honest
06:06 - and willing to say i don't know kajabi
06:10 - and then when you say you pride yourself
06:12 - in being a strong communicator and great
06:14 - team player
06:15 - i trust you see what i'm saying yeah
06:18 - yeah like
06:19 - because i'm like okay i she why would
06:21 - you say that
06:22 - if you were somebody who was just lying
06:24 - you know because you literally went out
06:25 - of your way to say you didn't know
06:27 - something
06:28 - yeah yeah um abdullah says amazing tips
06:32 - thanks for the advice sure says this is
06:33 - nice um
06:35 - we have everything ipad pro says the way
06:38 - she writes is just beautiful
06:41 - yeah minik says i've never thought of
06:44 - writing such a thing this is awesome
06:46 - yup and then she even goes on to say
06:48 - look forward to hearing from you if
06:50 - you'd like to discuss more and
06:51 - best of luck with finding someone
06:53 - awesome i mean
06:55 - who goes out of their way to even
06:57 - encourage you and be
06:58 - happy for you to find somebody else
07:00 - that's awesome
07:02 - ending on such a positive note is
07:04 - another huge
07:05 - thing everything eyepatch pro says
07:08 - rachel is an independent and strong
07:10 - woman and uh she's proud of you
07:13 - oh thank you yeah yeah
07:18 - and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had
07:22 - a really nice message to this
07:23 - and he says he said the letter is
07:25 - amazing i've never thought of writing
07:27 - such a letter
07:28 - finally wishing them and and he goes you
07:31 - finally wishing somebody good luck and
07:33 - finding that is
07:34 - this seriously shows the mindset of
07:36 - rachel
07:39 - so so that's yeah so that's huge because
07:42 - it shows where
07:45 - her mindset is and this is the letter
07:48 - that like resulted in i don't know fifty
07:50 - thousand dollars and more
07:52 - like i don't know i don't even know at
07:53 - this point how where we're at
07:56 - but like this is literally has led to
07:59 - over a 50 000 transaction and
08:03 - probably we're gonna work till many many
08:06 - more years like
08:07 - we like literally i would love to have
08:09 - rachel on the team for the next three
08:10 - five
08:11 - ten years on clever programmer and it
08:13 - all
08:14 - came from right here so it doesn't
08:17 - really get any more real than this
08:19 - yep pretty crazy
08:23 - that's crazy right
08:27 - you never thought one day your letter
08:29 - that you were gonna write was gonna be
08:30 - like broadcasted to thousands of people
08:34 - no i really didn't oh man i think you're
08:37 - right you're right
08:38 - it just shows the power of taking that
08:40 - time taking that time to really stop
08:42 - um stop think put yourself in the other
08:44 - person's shoes as to what they're
08:45 - looking for and
08:46 - yeah and like like we were talking about
08:48 - to put yourself in the right
08:50 - state when you're when you're
08:51 - approaching it as well you know put
08:53 - make sure you're in that positive place
08:54 - where you can write it with like all of
08:56 - the enthusiasm and
08:57 - best intentions and then you know let go
09:01 - yes yep uh john ford says rachel is a
09:05 - true professional
09:06 - her work her insta profile and this
09:08 - letter now
09:10 - everything speaks about how cool and
09:12 - good at her work she is
09:13 - simply amazing be like rachel
09:16 - no damn and o'shea says it takes
09:19 - just one good letter to change your life
09:22 - yep and uh kringet says nice message
09:26 - it's awesome the whole thing especially
09:27 - about being honest yep
09:31 - so i mean yeah this is something that's
09:34 - really valuable if you guys want to take
09:35 - a screenshot of this before we move on
09:37 - go ahead and do that it'll give you kind
09:40 - of like a template but again
09:42 - her whole point is personalized yeah
09:45 - yeah totally but even within
09:47 - personalization this is a good template
09:48 - to kind of work off of
09:51 - so what else rachel before we move on to
09:54 - the next slide
09:55 - yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking
09:57 - about how important personalizing is
10:00 - but there's a little note there about um
10:01 - a swipe file and by that what i mean is
10:04 - not copy and paste in
10:05 - um the same thing to every job but just
10:07 - having a couple of notes
10:08 - um if you know if you're doing a lot of
10:11 - outreach
10:12 - um you're reaching out to quite a few
10:14 - people that you're really interested in
10:16 - just having a little kind of swipe file
10:18 - of phrases that explain your skills that
10:19 - you can
10:20 - steal wording from so you don't put too
10:21 - much mental energy into that that's
10:23 - unnecessary i think that's something
10:25 - that's quite handy too
10:26 - yep a hundred percent so definitely use
10:31 - have those handy so that you can use
10:33 - them as reference and then grow
10:35 - like leverage them to be be able to
10:37 - write
10:38 - but guys yeah this is something that's
10:40 - really important it shows you
10:42 - it's not so much praying spray and just
10:44 - like
10:45 - reach out to 5 000 locations
10:48 - you can if you spend more time and you
10:51 - reach out with precision
10:52 - your success rate honestly is going to
10:54 - be much higher don't
10:56 - overthink it as well like don't spend
10:58 - three hours on a message
11:00 - but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10
11:02 - or 10 minutes personalizing
11:04 - write it and move on that would be
11:06 - really good yeah
11:08 - awesome so assad ali says i'm about to
11:12 - start my first freelancing job this is
11:13 - really
11:14 - helpful you guys deserve a lot thank you
11:16 - guys
11:17 - awesome yeah congratulations
11:20 - yeah uh tam mayor tim maryland says
11:23 - rachel i would want
11:24 - you to teach me writing true and very
11:26 - like detailed messages like these
11:28 - that's cool how to have a chat with you
11:32 - awesome okay so let's keep it moving so
11:34 - let's go on to the next one
11:37 - and uh this was the actual job posting
11:40 - right mm-hmm
11:42 - yeah yep so this is the job posting go
11:45 - ahead
11:45 - i'm just gonna say we just cut it up so
11:47 - yep that's it
11:49 - so yeah this is the posting guys this is
11:51 - part like this is
11:52 - you know the first part of it this is
11:53 - the second part of it it's the same
11:55 - posting yeah we just cut it up so it's
11:56 - all on the same page
11:58 - but like uh my main thing we were
12:00 - looking for was
12:02 - people who knew about all these
12:03 - technologies kajabi drip click funnel
12:06 - sam cart webinar jam zap
12:07 - zapier but i said like we need someone
12:10 - who can manage these systems
12:11 - understand how they work and be able to
12:13 - do it and
12:14 - um i wrote some specific things like
12:18 - you should be able to understand what we
12:19 - mean when we say x y z
12:22 - and if you don't know this you'd love to
12:24 - research it
12:25 - until you understand how it works and
12:27 - can put it together
12:29 - so you know going back and here i
12:31 - mentioned kajabi and going back to what
12:32 - rachel said
12:34 - she said in her message that she doesn't
12:36 - know kajabi but she's willing to
12:38 - learn it right and so she also
12:40 - understood like where i was coming from
12:42 - and then she mentioned that and she said
12:43 - i'd be willing to learn so it matches up
12:45 - to
12:46 - kind of what we were looking for and we
12:49 - said the right person will be confident
12:51 - in his
12:52 - his slash her intuition to figure out
12:55 - figure it out and get the job done
12:57 - correctly
12:58 - you may not know every platform but this
13:00 - is a type of work that makes you feel
13:01 - invincible
13:02 - and you are smart enough to figure it
13:04 - out and definitely when i spoke with
13:06 - rachel she already knew a lot of things
13:08 - and what she didn't know
13:09 - she said she would be willing to learn
13:11 - and then when i went on
13:12 - her social media on her facebook it
13:15 - confirmed with me she that she
13:17 - wasn't just saying words to say whatever
13:20 - she needed to say to get a job
13:22 - she was backing it up with her actions
13:25 - and i could see three months ago she was
13:26 - like
13:27 - posting about going down rabbit holes
13:29 - and learning about technology
13:31 - yeah so that was huge
13:34 - cool go ahead and remember also with
13:37 - that kazee
13:38 - right at the end of the requirements um
13:40 - and it said you wanted a minimum of two
13:42 - plus years hands-on
13:43 - administrative support experience oh
13:45 - yeah yeah so and i know
13:47 - things like that would sometimes put
13:48 - people off with the specifics oh yeah
13:49 - that was just complete like i
13:51 - don't even know what that meant
13:53 - i just put that i had no idea what that
13:55 - even meant
13:56 - i don't what is administrative support i
13:58 - have i had no idea
14:00 - exactly so it's always it's always worth
14:02 - it's always worth applying to something
14:04 - if you read it and you think yes
14:06 - and you connect you know even if there's
14:07 - something like that
14:09 - yeah so i mean like it also goes to show
14:13 - you that like
14:14 - and you didn't have that right just to
14:15 - be clear you didn't have two plus years
14:17 - of hands-on
14:18 - how much did you have um
14:21 - i think gosh six months to a year maybe
14:25 - at that point yeah so so basically
14:29 - another thing like don't say
14:30 - no for the other person yeah
14:35 - so like she she could have easily just
14:37 - said oh i don't have two years of
14:39 - experience i'm not gonna apply for this
14:42 - but she's just like she she replied for
14:44 - it anyway
14:45 - and it turns out that i was an idiot
14:48 - and i didn't even know what the hell i
14:50 - was looking for and i just put some
14:52 - random stuff in requirements
14:54 - and a lot of people who are looking like
14:56 - a lot of people who are actually posting
14:58 - these jobs
14:59 - from the hr department they even have no
15:02 - idea what the specs are
15:05 - yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you
15:07 - put it so well they're
15:08 - not saying no for them yeah so don't say
15:11 - no for them
15:12 - apply anyway intelligently and don't
15:15 - don't have those weird things put you
15:17 - off you know
15:18 - like um i saw this one post where the
15:20 - developer of the react.js library or
15:22 - something along those lines something
15:24 - really massive
15:25 - got rejected from a job and
15:29 - because they wanted like 10 years of
15:31 - experience
15:32 - and he says i have five years of
15:35 - experience or something along those
15:36 - lines
15:37 - and they're like sorry we need somebody
15:38 - with 10 and then he made a tweet and he
15:40 - says
15:41 - well i got rejected from my job but he
15:44 - goes i wrote the react.js library and
15:46 - it's only been out for five years
15:48 - oh wow so i was like
15:51 - oh wow so somebody can correct me in the
15:54 - chat below it's not really react and
15:56 - it's not the same time frame but the
15:57 - point is similar
15:59 - yeah uh so you know it's
16:02 - it's crazy but yeah all right moving on
16:05 - so what is going on here
16:07 - with this guy yeah this this guy's
16:11 - hiding from video
16:13 - oh no yeah i think the the one thing
16:16 - the other one thing i'd maybe do a
16:18 - little differently now
16:19 - um if i was kind of actively looking for
16:23 - on upwork right now
16:24 - is i would add in video so
16:27 - and in addition to because people like
16:28 - different platforms in addition to that
16:30 - written
16:30 - um message that i sent i would probably
16:34 - make a really short video
16:35 - just so that you can really connect with
16:37 - the other person because video's so
16:38 - powerful
16:39 - game changer so i think if you hop to
16:43 - the next one kazi
16:44 - um we're just talking about loom there
16:48 - and i mean even when you're working with
16:49 - clients like there's an example there um
16:52 - this is loom if if anybody hasn't used
16:53 - it before it's a free tool
16:55 - yep and here's your face this is a video
16:57 - here's her face
16:58 - talking over it and then she's sharing
17:00 - her screen but keep going rachel
17:02 - yeah yeah exactly this is me talking
17:05 - about something in one of our systems
17:07 - in kajabi but yeah i mean even once
17:09 - you're working with clients this could
17:10 - be so powerful just to kind of
17:12 - catch up especially if you're on
17:13 - different time zones and things but in
17:15 - the outreach phase
17:16 - um so so good for them to really get a
17:19 - feel for you
17:21 - um and i mean i've i can imagine that
17:23 - you would do this like if i would say
17:25 - research in clever programmer talk about
17:27 - club program again you could be on the
17:28 - clever program or website
17:29 - you could have that with the screen
17:31 - shared you could show what you were
17:32 - finding
17:33 - and talk over it and yeah the video was
17:36 - so powerful so i would
17:37 - just get comfortable with that um
17:40 - and with something like loom i mean you
17:42 - can even start by practicing if if video
17:44 - is something that is really
17:46 - um terrifying to you um you could just
17:48 - take baby steps
17:50 - yeah you've got things like instagram
17:52 - stories you can use loom and you can
17:54 - just make videos for yourself and just
17:55 - steadily get used to seeing yourself on
17:57 - the camera
17:58 - um and then by the time that you're in a
18:01 - position where you're working with
18:02 - clients and you've got video calls it's
18:03 - just second nature
18:05 - yep exactly i mean i try to
18:08 - start loom but i think my camera is
18:10 - being used up
18:11 - by another device so it's only like a
18:14 - yellow little mark here
18:16 - actually let me yeah let me end it right
18:19 - now
18:19 - but you you guys won't get a yellow
18:23 - mark like this which will happen is loom
18:26 - will record your screen so here
18:28 - i just record it for just a few seconds
18:30 - and you'll see it already created a link
18:32 - and the video is online so if you guys
18:35 - actually went to this link right here
18:38 - you'd be able to see this exact video i
18:40 - can even drop it in the chat
18:43 - and uh i mean it's not a very awesome
18:45 - video but
18:46 - you get the point the fact that i was
18:48 - able to make a video in like a second
18:50 - and then boom it's up so what rachel is
18:52 - saying is
18:54 - she would now actually make a video
18:57 - talking about
18:58 - what the client is looking for and then
19:00 - send that directly through upwork and
19:02 - that will crush
19:03 - if i had seen a video from you i would
19:05 - be like it's game over
19:07 - like i would just yeah i would probably
19:09 - skip the interview
19:11 - that's it it just gives you that so much
19:13 - extra connection doesn't it there's so
19:14 - much you can get from a video
19:16 - yep as an extra tool
19:20 - exactly so let's
19:23 - let me go full screen this
19:26 - huge tool all right so keep going rachel
19:29 - and if you want me to move on to the
19:30 - next one i can do that too
19:32 - yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to
19:34 - the next one
19:36 - all right let's do it and ahmad says
19:38 - seriously the years of experience
19:40 - doesn't matter if you have the skills
19:41 - and that's it
19:42 - most people are afraid to apply for jobs
19:44 - when they see
19:45 - that years of experience mm-hmm yeah
19:49 - so true it's

Cleaned transcript:

now moving on talk to us about like personalize your messages okay so this is um this is where we met causey oh this is actually holy crap this is actually your real message to me the first one actual first one yep yep there was a kind of um a little proposal that goes with it but this was the cover letter so this is what i sent to try and stand out when i saw your your the job application and now you've been working with us for what two point uh first ever message uh and now this is so cool this is so cool you guys like the fact that and now she's been working with us for two and a half years at cp that's insane like that is one of the coolest things i mean nobody i've never seen a training like this like this is so cool that we can talk about this it's crazy right yeah that is insane go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks to how much power there is in um just really putting some effort into the right kind of job application or whatever whatever way that you're reaching out to people putting some thought into it doing your research on who the other person is um really taking your time and especially on platforms like at work you see a lot of copy and pastes yes you know oh my god people just they just apply for this every all these jobs with the same thing it doesn't speak to your own application to the skills to the character which if you can just take that time to really um really hone in on what they're asking for yeah um because i mean all the time to your point i would get these like garbage messages on upwork and just like hey really interesting project you have there i could definitely help you and then blah blah and i'm like that's your what 104th copy paste of the day you know yeah and so when i saw a message like yours it was extremely refreshing to see somebody who actually read what we had written and wrote specifically for that so like what rachel is saying is like guys stop using canned messages when you reach out to these platforms it's not a game of volume it's a game of like reaching out with quality yeah yeah oh totally totally um and i want to even read out your message because i think it's really important you guys could even use this as a template so rachel reached down and she said hi there and she goes i really enjoyed reading your job posting and it would be awesome to chat with you about whether i'd be a good fit for the role honestly when i read this i thought it was like a canned message probably you know most likely because that's what i got from a lot of people but then this is where i got interested i love problem solving and getting tech tools to work together my background is ten years in accountancy and admin but six months ago i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal work is in problem solving so here she said problem solving love problem solving in my initial job posting i had mentioned problem solving multiple times um yeah i think i've popped the post a little further down as well because so it's there in case yeah oh yeah that's awesome we can actually take a look at that too um oh wow even amanat is he's like um he's this letter is amazing i've never thought of writing a letter like that finally wishing him good this is awesome so here um so i've got experience in leadpages and various email webinar payment course systems these specific systems we were talking about but not kajabi and this is honestly one of those things that kind of just like hits you in the heart like this was one of the things where i'm like not only do we not have somebody who's possibly really good at it but the fact that she says openly she doesn't know kajabi and not like some wishywashy answer like literally she's like not kajabi that is huge because already i can tell so much about her character and integrity and i want to work with somebody on the team who has character and integrity i don't want to work with people who put politics above everything else right so going on and she goes yet i'm really keen to learn all of these systems so that's important to me that she's very flexible and so would be very happy in my element in fact to learn them quickly and on my own time like that is just beautifully written it's like somebody's dream to have somebody like that working on their team where they're like hey i would i don't know them this is actually funny right because at the start of this video that's what i said if you don't know it just say it and say i'll be able to willing to learn later literally what you say here and um we have messages that are like joseph says this is a working template nice one rachel o'shea says rachel's letter is perfect it's brief specific and detailed really good job so lucy says this is so useful hassan says eloquent amazing job says amanath abdullah says yeah rachel amazing job no thanks guys yeah seriously it's actually really amazing and then she goes i love research and have found some great resources so i can quickly get familiar with them i pride myself in being proactive a strong communicator and a great team player honestly this statement i trust if anybody else says it i would just ignore it but like do you guys know what makes me want to trust this statement more like what out of this entire thing what was it that makes me actually trust this statement more and if you want to guess drop it in the comments below but for me it was actually this statement where she just openly is so honest and willing to say i don't know kajabi and then when you say you pride yourself in being a strong communicator and great team player i trust you see what i'm saying yeah yeah like because i'm like okay i she why would you say that if you were somebody who was just lying you know because you literally went out of your way to say you didn't know something yeah yeah um abdullah says amazing tips thanks for the advice sure says this is nice um we have everything ipad pro says the way she writes is just beautiful yeah minik says i've never thought of writing such a thing this is awesome yup and then she even goes on to say look forward to hearing from you if you'd like to discuss more and best of luck with finding someone awesome i mean who goes out of their way to even encourage you and be happy for you to find somebody else that's awesome ending on such a positive note is another huge thing everything eyepatch pro says rachel is an independent and strong woman and uh she's proud of you oh thank you yeah yeah and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had a really nice message to this and he says he said the letter is amazing i've never thought of writing such a letter finally wishing them and and he goes you finally wishing somebody good luck and finding that is this seriously shows the mindset of rachel so so that's yeah so that's huge because it shows where her mindset is and this is the letter that like resulted in i don't know fifty thousand dollars and more like i don't know i don't even know at this point how where we're at but like this is literally has led to over a 50 000 transaction and probably we're gonna work till many many more years like we like literally i would love to have rachel on the team for the next three five ten years on clever programmer and it all came from right here so it doesn't really get any more real than this yep pretty crazy that's crazy right you never thought one day your letter that you were gonna write was gonna be like broadcasted to thousands of people no i really didn't oh man i think you're right you're right it just shows the power of taking that time taking that time to really stop um stop think put yourself in the other person's shoes as to what they're looking for and yeah and like like we were talking about to put yourself in the right state when you're when you're approaching it as well you know put make sure you're in that positive place where you can write it with like all of the enthusiasm and best intentions and then you know let go yes yep uh john ford says rachel is a true professional her work her insta profile and this letter now everything speaks about how cool and good at her work she is simply amazing be like rachel no damn and o'shea says it takes just one good letter to change your life yep and uh kringet says nice message it's awesome the whole thing especially about being honest yep so i mean yeah this is something that's really valuable if you guys want to take a screenshot of this before we move on go ahead and do that it'll give you kind of like a template but again her whole point is personalized yeah yeah totally but even within personalization this is a good template to kind of work off of so what else rachel before we move on to the next slide yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking about how important personalizing is but there's a little note there about um a swipe file and by that what i mean is not copy and paste in um the same thing to every job but just having a couple of notes um if you know if you're doing a lot of outreach um you're reaching out to quite a few people that you're really interested in just having a little kind of swipe file of phrases that explain your skills that you can steal wording from so you don't put too much mental energy into that that's unnecessary i think that's something that's quite handy too yep a hundred percent so definitely use have those handy so that you can use them as reference and then grow like leverage them to be be able to write but guys yeah this is something that's really important it shows you it's not so much praying spray and just like reach out to 5 000 locations you can if you spend more time and you reach out with precision your success rate honestly is going to be much higher don't overthink it as well like don't spend three hours on a message but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10 or 10 minutes personalizing write it and move on that would be really good yeah awesome so assad ali says i'm about to start my first freelancing job this is really helpful you guys deserve a lot thank you guys awesome yeah congratulations yeah uh tam mayor tim maryland says rachel i would want you to teach me writing true and very like detailed messages like these that's cool how to have a chat with you awesome okay so let's keep it moving so let's go on to the next one and uh this was the actual job posting right mmhmm yeah yep so this is the job posting go ahead i'm just gonna say we just cut it up so yep that's it so yeah this is the posting guys this is part like this is you know the first part of it this is the second part of it it's the same posting yeah we just cut it up so it's all on the same page but like uh my main thing we were looking for was people who knew about all these technologies kajabi drip click funnel sam cart webinar jam zap zapier but i said like we need someone who can manage these systems understand how they work and be able to do it and um i wrote some specific things like you should be able to understand what we mean when we say x y z and if you don't know this you'd love to research it until you understand how it works and can put it together so you know going back and here i mentioned kajabi and going back to what rachel said she said in her message that she doesn't know kajabi but she's willing to learn it right and so she also understood like where i was coming from and then she mentioned that and she said i'd be willing to learn so it matches up to kind of what we were looking for and we said the right person will be confident in his his slash her intuition to figure out figure it out and get the job done correctly you may not know every platform but this is a type of work that makes you feel invincible and you are smart enough to figure it out and definitely when i spoke with rachel she already knew a lot of things and what she didn't know she said she would be willing to learn and then when i went on her social media on her facebook it confirmed with me she that she wasn't just saying words to say whatever she needed to say to get a job she was backing it up with her actions and i could see three months ago she was like posting about going down rabbit holes and learning about technology yeah so that was huge cool go ahead and remember also with that kazee right at the end of the requirements um and it said you wanted a minimum of two plus years handson administrative support experience oh yeah yeah so and i know things like that would sometimes put people off with the specifics oh yeah that was just complete like i don't even know what that meant i just put that i had no idea what that even meant i don't what is administrative support i have i had no idea exactly so it's always it's always worth it's always worth applying to something if you read it and you think yes and you connect you know even if there's something like that yeah so i mean like it also goes to show you that like and you didn't have that right just to be clear you didn't have two plus years of handson how much did you have um i think gosh six months to a year maybe at that point yeah so so basically another thing like don't say no for the other person yeah so like she she could have easily just said oh i don't have two years of experience i'm not gonna apply for this but she's just like she she replied for it anyway and it turns out that i was an idiot and i didn't even know what the hell i was looking for and i just put some random stuff in requirements and a lot of people who are looking like a lot of people who are actually posting these jobs from the hr department they even have no idea what the specs are yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you put it so well they're not saying no for them yeah so don't say no for them apply anyway intelligently and don't don't have those weird things put you off you know like um i saw this one post where the developer of the react.js library or something along those lines something really massive got rejected from a job and because they wanted like 10 years of experience and he says i have five years of experience or something along those lines and they're like sorry we need somebody with 10 and then he made a tweet and he says well i got rejected from my job but he goes i wrote the react.js library and it's only been out for five years oh wow so i was like oh wow so somebody can correct me in the chat below it's not really react and it's not the same time frame but the point is similar yeah uh so you know it's it's crazy but yeah all right moving on so what is going on here with this guy yeah this this guy's hiding from video oh no yeah i think the the one thing the other one thing i'd maybe do a little differently now um if i was kind of actively looking for on upwork right now is i would add in video so and in addition to because people like different platforms in addition to that written um message that i sent i would probably make a really short video just so that you can really connect with the other person because video's so powerful game changer so i think if you hop to the next one kazi um we're just talking about loom there and i mean even when you're working with clients like there's an example there um this is loom if if anybody hasn't used it before it's a free tool yep and here's your face this is a video here's her face talking over it and then she's sharing her screen but keep going rachel yeah yeah exactly this is me talking about something in one of our systems in kajabi but yeah i mean even once you're working with clients this could be so powerful just to kind of catch up especially if you're on different time zones and things but in the outreach phase um so so good for them to really get a feel for you um and i mean i've i can imagine that you would do this like if i would say research in clever programmer talk about club program again you could be on the clever program or website you could have that with the screen shared you could show what you were finding and talk over it and yeah the video was so powerful so i would just get comfortable with that um and with something like loom i mean you can even start by practicing if if video is something that is really um terrifying to you um you could just take baby steps yeah you've got things like instagram stories you can use loom and you can just make videos for yourself and just steadily get used to seeing yourself on the camera um and then by the time that you're in a position where you're working with clients and you've got video calls it's just second nature yep exactly i mean i try to start loom but i think my camera is being used up by another device so it's only like a yellow little mark here actually let me yeah let me end it right now but you you guys won't get a yellow mark like this which will happen is loom will record your screen so here i just record it for just a few seconds and you'll see it already created a link and the video is online so if you guys actually went to this link right here you'd be able to see this exact video i can even drop it in the chat and uh i mean it's not a very awesome video but you get the point the fact that i was able to make a video in like a second and then boom it's up so what rachel is saying is she would now actually make a video talking about what the client is looking for and then send that directly through upwork and that will crush if i had seen a video from you i would be like it's game over like i would just yeah i would probably skip the interview that's it it just gives you that so much extra connection doesn't it there's so much you can get from a video yep as an extra tool exactly so let's let me go full screen this huge tool all right so keep going rachel and if you want me to move on to the next one i can do that too yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to the next one all right let's do it and ahmad says seriously the years of experience doesn't matter if you have the skills and that's it most people are afraid to apply for jobs when they see that years of experience mmhmm yeah so true it's
