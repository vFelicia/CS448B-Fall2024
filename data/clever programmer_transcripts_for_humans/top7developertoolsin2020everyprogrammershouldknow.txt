01:02 - let's get it going come on let's go
01:04 - frankie
01:05 - we got this there we go so this is
01:08 - the top tools for developers
01:12 - and we're going to speak about all of
01:13 - these things we're going to go into
01:14 - details
01:15 - with this and so drop me drop in the

01:38 - ready let's go so guys
01:42 - actually guys
01:45 - yes why tools why tools
01:50 - i don't know so why to why tools guys
01:53 - why do you guys think
01:54 - we need tools in general as developers
01:57 - that's a question
01:58 - from from me to you okay so
02:02 - um the way i see it personally and let
02:04 - me know kind of what how you see it
02:05 - frankie
02:06 - the way i see it personally is tools
02:08 - make us more efficient
02:09 - tools make us faster and tools a lot
02:12 - give us a
02:13 - much faster learning curve so you can
02:16 - just skyrocket
02:17 - to the moon infinity and beyond am i
02:21 - right
02:21 - am i right yes indeed yeah at the end of
02:24 - the day you don't want to be
02:25 - you know patrick star and have you know
02:29 - being having the nail on your forehead
02:31 - not knowing how to use a hammer and
02:32 - everything
02:33 - so tools are not gonna change your whole
02:37 - game if you don't put in the work
02:38 - you know like nasa's been saying at the
02:40 - end of the day it's just to get better
02:42 - at everything that you do
02:44 - and also become more efficient on your
02:46 - workplace because
02:47 - you know you can take five hours doing a
02:49 - specific task but if you have the right
02:51 - tools it might only take you about one
02:53 - minute or two
02:54 - yes exactly exactly by the way i just
02:57 - want to say welcome to everybody here we
02:59 - got ha
02:59 - ha because we got harped you guys are
03:02 - amazing hundred thanks so much
03:04 - says whoa whoa nas and frankie so
03:07 - awesome to see you guys in the comments
03:09 - thank you guys for being here
03:10 - awesome thank you all for being here all
03:12 - right let's get this party started
03:14 - frankie
03:16 - let's get this party started hey
03:20 - hey let's get this party started so nice
03:23 - take it over
03:24 - let's see what's the next step for us uh
03:27 - next what next step
03:28 - all right so first things first we're
03:30 - going to talk about these text
03:31 - editors okay um so what are the top text
03:34 - editors that we're going to we're going
03:35 - to talk about today frankie yokaze come
03:41 - frankie what did you say what are the
03:43 - top tech senators we're going to talk
03:44 - about today
03:45 - so the top ones for us at least
03:48 - it's going to be bs code it's going to
03:50 - be intellij
03:52 - it's going to be eclipse and swift so
03:54 - the thing about this is that
03:56 - you know depending on the type of
03:57 - development that you're doing you're
03:59 - going to use either an ide
04:01 - or a text editor so if you're doing
04:03 - something
04:04 - you know like javascript or even python
04:06 - you can use things like vs code
04:08 - which are a little bit more lightweight
04:10 - you know they're not as robust as
04:12 - big ides like you know eclipse intellij
04:15 - even netbeans which is freaking insanely
04:19 - heavy to run on your system but you know
04:22 - whatever language you're using whatever
04:24 - type of tool you're creating
04:25 - is the type of id that you'll be using
04:27 - so if you're trying to do ios apps you
04:29 - have to use
04:30 - xcode yes yes yes so like
04:33 - like because kind of how frankie said
04:35 - right you know vs code is our top our
04:38 - top one that we like to
04:39 - we like to like to use if you guys are
04:41 - using java for example then you're going
04:43 - to use for example eclipse which is the
04:44 - one that's kind of in the middle
04:46 - um and xcode if you're going to use for
04:48 - example like
04:49 - um if you're going to use you know swift
04:53 - or you know programming for and building
04:54 - ios apps or building apps for
04:57 - mac right so you're going to use those
04:59 - specific
05:00 - ones by the way i just want to say thank
05:01 - you okay guys visual
05:03 - vishal shah really appreciate your
05:05 - donation you're 20
05:07 - i'm not i never know what this is 20
05:08 - euros no 20 something
05:10 - 20 some money i never know what money it
05:13 - is
05:14 - but yeah michelle really appreciate it
05:16 - amanda how's it going
05:18 - how's it going thanks so much amanda um
05:21 - to for being in the chat always being so
05:24 - supportive
05:25 - um sayudi is like super chat within
05:27 - three minutes let's go say yuri
05:29 - sweet sweet sweet but yeah canada kind
05:32 - of how
05:32 - you know uh frankie talked about guys um
05:35 - eclipse and intellij is going to be
05:37 - great for when you're doing like a lot
05:39 - more higher
05:40 - higher level um more complicated
05:43 - programming for example maybe you're
05:45 - building using c sharp or maybe for
05:46 - example you are
05:47 - you could you are using um
05:50 - i don't know java or c plus plus
05:54 - right you're gonna be using those
05:55 - specific ones but
05:57 - but for your basic ones you know vs code
05:59 - is gonna be the one
06:00 - for you um honestly
06:04 - but yeah guys so yeah as we're kind of
06:06 - just going through some stuff
06:09 - just want to say welcome again welcome
06:11 - again
06:12 - we got vivid elite says hey i got a
06:14 - question i dabbed in a little bit of
06:15 - java and web development
06:17 - when i was 12 and have been flying
06:18 - through this swapped out
06:20 - class i've been doing i should explain
06:22 - that as a previous experience
06:23 - sweet that's awesome that's awesome that
06:26 - is great
06:28 - how should i explain that i already had
06:30 - a preview experience so
06:31 - tell us why you like us code that much
06:33 - man
06:34 - why i like this code so vs code is just
06:37 - amazing
06:38 - because it's lightweight it's fast it
06:40 - has a ton
06:41 - of extensions right a ton of extensions
06:45 - and it's just used by so many developers
06:47 - at this point um
06:48 - that that it's nuts yeah yeah it's crazy
06:52 - there's a huge community around bs code
06:54 - it's kind of like a cult to be on friday
06:56 - i can't
06:57 - be honest so a lot of people use vs code
07:00 - it's
07:01 - it's a huge community also you know
07:03 - javascript is greatly used to vs code so
07:06 - the community in javascript is huge you
07:08 - know
07:08 - you're trying to jump into other
07:09 - languages like flutter and all of these
07:11 - you know
07:11 - those newer languages don't have
07:13 - communities as big as these so
07:14 - you can ask you know all the detailed
07:16 - questions that you'd like
07:18 - you can get all these those different
07:19 - answers and everything so you know it
07:21 - all
07:21 - adds up to that now we're gonna go to
07:23 - our next slide
07:24 - which is so these are gonna be the text
07:27 - editors for web developers right so
07:30 - these are the top
07:30 - ones you know even node plus plus is
07:34 - there
07:34 - which you know a lot of people that are
07:36 - not even developers use note
07:37 - note plus plus um notepad plus plus and
07:41 - at the end of the day i used to use it
07:43 - to just
07:43 - use you know get notes here and there
07:46 - also
07:46 - sublime text is one of the biggest ones
07:49 - as well
07:50 - people love it or hate it because it
07:52 - always you know
07:53 - it always pops up a window that tells
07:55 - you to pay for the program
07:57 - so yeah that's kind of a funny thing
07:58 - there as well yeah
08:00 - yeah yeah but i would say with internet
08:02 - starters guys very important
08:04 - very important uh just pick one you know
08:06 - and go with the guys don't don't try to
08:08 - you know
08:09 - don't try to think so much about
08:19 - okay yeah at the end of the day i feel
08:21 - like people do spend a lot of time
08:24 - trying to get the perfect ide or
08:27 - text editor but you know it's all about
08:29 - having a
08:31 - specific environment where you feel
08:32 - comfortable in you know working with
08:34 - your code
08:35 - and a lot of times if it's slow and
08:37 - everything it's just going to hold you
08:38 - back so make sure that you make the
08:39 - right choice with that
08:41 - sweet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
08:45 - like you said already a little bit yeah
08:46 - yeah
08:49 - the bs code okay guys if you use
08:52 - your best that is what you like the most
08:58 - so right here we're putting also some vs
09:00 - code extensions
09:01 - just because of the fact that this code
09:03 - is really good on its own
09:05 - you really don't need anything mouse was
09:06 - actually going a little bit deep into
09:08 - this
09:08 - that sometimes people don't even know
09:11 - you know that much
09:11 - coding but they try to entertain
09:13 - themselves by downloading a bunch of
09:16 - different extensions
09:17 - and thing is you know you can get
09:19 - distracted with that
09:20 - but these extensions such as prettier
09:23 - and then liveshare and then bracket
09:25 - colorizer i feel are very productive
09:28 - in the sense that you know prettier
09:30 - makes your code
09:31 - indent and actually refactor the right
09:34 - the correct way so it's easier to
09:36 - to see it to play with it and to work
09:38 - with others
09:39 - other people's code as well so liveshare
09:43 - is also the actual extension that we use
09:46 - here
09:46 - in our all of our clone builds you know
09:48 - sonny and kazi are always
09:50 - you doing pair programming it's a
09:52 - awesome tool to start you know working
09:54 - with other people
09:55 - on your team and then inviting people to
09:57 - edit your code
10:00 - can you tell us a little bit more about
10:02 - bracket regularizing us
10:04 - yeah i think yeah in terms of bracket
10:07 - colorizer
10:08 - um you know a lot of times guys you know
10:10 - you would have you know
10:11 - you have a long piece of code right and
10:13 - you have kind of
10:14 - called the triangle you guys know what
10:16 - the triangle of death is basically it's
10:17 - just like
10:18 - you have an if statement or a force or a
10:20 - function but within another function
10:22 - and it just kind of creates a lot of
10:24 - brackets right and so what happens is
10:26 - let me know if you agree with me on this
10:28 - one what happens is you actually
10:30 - can't you don't know specifically what
10:33 - bracket contributes to what other
10:34 - brackets
10:36 - okay right so when we do it
10:40 - so we do something like a polarizer that
10:43 - will tell you specifically
10:44 - hey this bracket is specifically with
10:46 - this right this bracket specifically
10:48 - with this bracket
10:49 - and so forth and it keeps going and
10:50 - keeps going so highly recommend you get
10:53 - you guys get that one
10:54 - very very very very useful keep it on
10:57 - the screen
11:12 - awesome so another addition to the tools
11:15 - that we use here on the team
11:17 - specifically
11:18 - is going to be these three so rocket is
11:20 - amazing
11:21 - you know if you do want to humanize your
11:24 - text a little bit more
11:25 - then i think you know adding emojis to
11:28 - everything just
11:28 - adds a little bit of spice so whether
11:31 - that's in any title that you're doing
11:33 - just conversations with people on your
11:34 - team trying to you know pull out a
11:36 - report on you know stats or the code
11:38 - that you're working in
11:39 - you know you can make it always look
11:41 - pretty with rockets
11:43 - so alfred is actually one of my favorite
11:46 - ones
11:47 - i can't believe i was living my life
11:48 - without using this specifically
11:50 - and i'm just going to show you guys
11:51 - really quick how to
11:54 - use it so i got it here on screen and so
11:56 - one of the biggest things that i like
11:58 - about alfred
11:59 - is the fact that you can find specific
12:01 - files so let's find
12:03 - clever programmer logo
12:08 - okay so there's not that one right but
12:10 - everything that
12:11 - it's actually right here so clear
12:12 - programmer lower you can find any
12:14 - file that you're looking for
12:16 - specifically and then the cool thing
12:18 - about this
12:19 - is that it also has a clipboard that
12:22 - you can you know save things for about
12:24 - 90 days so if you're trying to save a
12:26 - chunk of code a snippet of code or
12:28 - something like that
12:29 - then you can just reuse it and then
12:31 - paste it so
12:33 - that's specifically what what alfred
12:37 - does
12:38 - and let me go back the last one would be
12:41 - yoink
12:42 - yoink is awesome as well if you're a
12:43 - developer because you know as developers
12:45 - you're always moving things around
12:47 - whether that's on your desktop moving
12:48 - files and everything
12:50 - so one of the hideous and most you know
12:54 - frustrating things for me is moving
12:56 - files around different screens
12:58 - you know if you have your google chrome
12:59 - open or if you have
13:01 - multiple screens sometimes instead of
13:03 - dragging something all the way to the
13:05 - side
13:08 - so give me one second i can't give you a
13:12 - presentation of viewing right now
13:14 - but it's supposed to be a little
13:16 - clipboard that's attached to the side of
13:18 - your screen
13:19 - and you can just pull the file and then
13:21 - put it
13:22 - next to the screen so i feel like it's
13:25 - very useful i showed it to sunny sunny
13:27 - loved it he's like bro
13:29 - i don't know exactly how was how i was
13:30 - being a developer without this
13:32 - what do you think about these tools yeah
13:35 - so i i love
13:36 - i remember when i realized what like
13:38 - rocket or alfred or
13:39 - yoink was i was like holy but
13:42 - yeah amazing amazing amazing tools guys
13:45 - highly recommend them
13:46 - um yeah just get them take a look at
13:49 - them give them a try
13:50 - and then continue on awesome so now
13:53 - we're going to go to the next point
13:54 - which is communication
13:55 - we think communication tools are super
13:58 - important if you're a developer
14:00 - just because of the fact that you're
14:01 - always working with other people and
14:03 - this is just a funny meme right here you
14:04 - know it says
14:05 - what is this communication word you
14:06 - speak of all right so
14:09 - like we said communication is vital
14:11 - these are some of the
14:12 - actual programs that we use the software
14:14 - that we use
14:15 - and right now our company actually uses
14:17 - slack we used to
14:19 - have you know all of our conversations
14:21 - on whether that's imessages just
14:23 - facebook messenger
14:24 - or we actually use basecamp a lot too
14:27 - but we ended up sticking with actual
14:30 - you know slack because slack is
14:34 - is very very efficient in terms of file
14:37 - sharing
14:37 - just the actual chat and everything but
14:39 - before that we were actually using
14:41 - basecamp
14:42 - now a lot of things in communication do
14:45 - differ a little bit let's say
14:46 - like right here we listed trello just
14:48 - because you know if you are working with
14:51 - clients or you're having projects
14:53 - or trying to project manage you know
14:54 - whatever you're doing with your code
14:56 - working with more people
14:57 - trello is actually a very good way to do
15:00 - this
15:00 - so you know you can use kanban style
15:03 - boards
15:04 - and then give a little bit of details of
15:05 - all the code that you're writing there
15:07 - and then actually assign people to you
15:09 - know either edit your code add things to
15:11 - it or
15:12 - think to the sort and asana is a very
15:14 - very similar
15:16 - tool like trello just like trello we use
15:19 - this too
15:20 - and specifically i feel like these two
15:23 - are great for
15:24 - client client and you know
15:28 - project relationships and communication
15:31 - what do you think about business yeah so
15:34 - i'm a big
15:35 - of asana and i think we have i mean
15:38 - [Music]
15:53 - 40 amount of money really appreciate
15:56 - that
15:57 - but yeah great tools guys you know to
15:59 - consider if you're gonna use
16:00 - if you're gonna pick one if you're going
16:01 - to pick one for teams let's say you're
16:03 - working on a project for example
16:04 - i'd highly recommend you for example use
16:06 - slack
16:20 - so bro i know that you were working a
16:22 - lot in freelancing so what type of tools
16:24 - would you use in freelancing yourself
16:27 - yeah so in freelancing 100 slack for a
16:29 - team
16:30 - okay and then and then 100
16:33 - also um
16:49 - kind of you know about a year ago and
16:50 - that's when i kind of came in and
16:51 - started working with you guys
16:53 - and i also introduced travel um but
16:56 - trello and another one that i would also
16:58 - use as well it's not on here but it's
17:00 - called
17:00 - jira something to take a look at it's
17:02 - like think of it as like
17:04 - a more professional version of trouble
17:08 - nice how do you spell that j-i-r-a
17:13 - j-i-i-r-a so
17:16 - zero
17:19 - yeah okay awesome so
17:23 - communication is awesome guys please you
17:25 - know try to develop your communication
17:27 - skills
17:28 - the more that the more better that you
17:30 - get in communication
17:32 - it's going to be easier for you to just
17:33 - go into
17:35 - you know more more actual managerial
17:38 - roles
17:38 - actually you know trying to lead a team
17:41 - and then
17:42 - taking the best out of people so that
17:44 - you can you guys can work together
17:46 - so this is going to lead me to my next
17:48 - light and we already touched a little
17:50 - bit on it
17:52 - and it's working remotely essential so
17:54 - nas felt like it was very important to
17:56 - add these two aspects of the software
17:59 - that we use
18:00 - and can you explain a little bit about
18:12 - this
18:20 - oh he you can hear me now there you go
18:23 - now sorry my bad my bad my bad
18:24 - but awesome that was what i was saying
18:27 - is like loom
18:28 - is a great one if you are you know
18:31 - working remotely
18:32 - working at home working at home and
18:36 - you need to go ahead and share some
18:38 - knowledge you need to go ahead and
18:40 - communicate with
18:41 - another teammate right um simply record
18:45 - what it really does what makes it so
18:47 - easy is the fact that you can simply
18:49 - click record really fast okay it will
18:52 - record your voice it will record
18:55 - what you're trying to what point you're
18:56 - trying to get through and then
18:58 - it will right away actually upload it to
19:00 - the internet
19:01 - automatically you can copy the link and
19:04 - then send it to your
19:04 - co-worker so if you are working
19:08 - from home
19:13 - you know just kind of get it play around
19:16 - with it right you can you know
19:17 - you can basically record it on the fly
19:19 - and it just makes things so much
19:21 - so much easier
19:30 - guys you know loom can be used in so
19:32 - many different ways like now said
19:33 - whether you're sharing code with people
19:35 - even if you want to go into interviews
19:37 - one time we had this guy who actually
19:40 - wanted to work with clever programmer
19:41 - and he sent qazi a loom video explaining
19:44 - kind of
19:44 - you know his skills and everything i
19:46 - think he was uh he was a marketer he was
19:48 - doing facebook ads or something similar
19:50 - so he went over his profile and kind of
19:52 - just talked a little bit more about his
19:53 - skills because he was
19:54 - amazed he was like wow this guy is
19:56 - insane i want to hire him
19:58 - you know so yeah even for interviews and
20:01 - things like that
20:02 - loom can be very very powerful
20:18 - kind of as you know as a form of like
20:21 - hey check me out
20:22 - can i get a job at the company dude and
20:25 - guess what
20:26 - what happened he got the job at the
20:28 - company wow
20:29 - yeah thank goodness yeah dude insane
20:32 - insane
20:33 - insane stuff that's awesome man i'm
20:36 - super happy to hear that
20:37 - by the way thank you so much for 20
20:41 - rupees yeah again i really appreciate it
20:43 - man thank you robin appreciate you man
20:46 - so then the second work essential that
20:48 - we think is
20:49 - super important for people to get good
20:51 - at is going to be droplet
20:53 - so droplet i did not know about this
20:55 - until i met qazi
20:57 - and i became a killer in just showing
20:59 - people
21:00 - what i'm exactly working on what i need
21:02 - help with and stuff
21:03 - because you're able to take screenshots
21:06 - really easily
21:07 - and you can actually so you can take
21:10 - let's say
21:12 - a screenshot of this and then
21:15 - point out like okay i need help here
21:18 - and then you can just share it it's
21:20 - gonna give you a little link so the
21:22 - image is gonna be uploaded to the
21:23 - internet
21:24 - automatically and then after that you're
21:26 - gonna get a link that you can share with
21:27 - anybody and everybody anybody that has
21:29 - that that link can access that image
21:32 - so it's really fast it's actually
21:35 - faster than the actual native program
21:38 - that is a mac
21:39 - i feel like that one is too robust and
21:41 - kind of slow so dropper is a great way
21:43 - to share
21:44 - your ideas i use it a lot to share
21:46 - reports such as ads
21:47 - and everything of the sort what do you
21:50 - think about dropper
21:53 - man i love dropper and when i found out
21:55 - that we could use it oh man
21:57 - i got so happy it just makes things so
22:00 - much easier like if you you know really
22:01 - quickly if you want to screenshot
22:03 - an idea or you want to screenshot
22:04 - something you saw online
22:06 - um screenshot it quick annotation add
22:09 - some text to it
22:10 - make a or two and be like yo check this
22:12 - out you know or check this out
22:14 - check this out check this out put as
22:16 - many arrows you can put as many arrows
22:18 - as you want
22:18 - and it's just so quick so quick and then
22:22 - upload
22:22 - automatically so yeah exactly it's a
22:25 - beautiful beautiful software that you
22:26 - should become good at it's free
22:28 - i think there's a pro version and i
22:30 - believe it's like five dollars a month
22:31 - so it's totally worth it
22:33 - go into that so now this leads us to our
22:36 - next point
22:36 - which is time
22:40 - management time management is
22:43 - super duper important i feel like you
22:45 - know i talk about this all the time but
22:48 - really time is the most important asset
22:50 - that you know we
22:51 - as humans have just because of the fact
22:53 - that you know
22:55 - other assets such as money are always
22:57 - replenishable you can always get more
22:58 - money you can always build more skill to
23:00 - get more money
23:01 - or do something else that'll bring you
23:03 - money but what we cannot do
23:05 - is there's literally nothing in life
23:07 - that is going to give you more time
23:09 - you know everybody in the whole world
23:12 - has only 24 hours a day to do whatever
23:15 - they want to carry out in that day
23:17 - and so the difference the difference
23:19 - that you can do yourself is actually
23:21 - learn how to manage
23:22 - your 24 hours in a more productive way
23:26 - so we're going to go deeper into that
23:28 - let's do it man
23:30 - awesome so a little bit of time
23:32 - management here
23:33 - you have to set time sprints for
23:35 - yourself so let's say you're working on
23:37 - code you're working on a project
23:39 - i feel like i myself work way way better
23:42 - once i kind of have you know a certain
23:45 - plan of attack right so let's say i'm
23:48 - i'm gonna code for
23:49 - 30 minutes and then rest for 10 or 5. i
23:52 - feel like that's
23:53 - super vital for me just because you know
23:55 - i want to do this for the long term
23:57 - and i want to actually have very
24:00 - good clarity while i'm working on things
24:02 - because sometimes we're working on
24:03 - things so much
24:04 - so extensively that we get so deep into
24:07 - either the code or whatever thing that
24:08 - you're working on
24:09 - and sometimes you just kind of have to
24:11 - have to take a step back
24:13 - and from there you can reassess you know
24:15 - what needs to be done
24:17 - so one of the cool things about time
24:19 - management
24:20 - that i use a lot is kind of just what i
24:22 - mentioned right now is the pomodoro
24:24 - technique
24:25 - so pomodoro is very very important for
24:28 - me
24:29 - the way that i use it is i do 25 minutes
24:31 - and then i rest for five
24:32 - i do this while i'm editing videos you
24:34 - know a lot of the videos that you guys
24:35 - see here
24:36 - are edited by me or either alex or aaron
24:39 - as well so
24:40 - that's super helpful for me especially
24:42 - if i'm doing something creative
24:44 - and then you want to talk about the last
24:46 - point now
24:48 - yeah the last point which is you know uh
24:50 - kind of getting rid of like stress and
24:52 - anxiety
24:53 - um i know that all of us you know here
24:56 - have
24:56 - stress we have anxiety right we have
24:59 - work which gives us you know stress and
25:00 - things like that
25:01 - or other external things which give us
25:03 - stress and so
25:05 - for me it's just especially for me it's
25:07 - extremely important to kind of be able
25:09 - to
25:09 - uh balance myself okay because if you're
25:12 - always stressed out if you're always
25:14 - kind of an anxiety
25:15 - state um that's not a good way to live
25:18 - like am i right
25:19 - you don't want to live like that um so
25:22 - you need to have
25:23 - tools right you need to have tools to
25:24 - kind of bring that down and to be able
25:26 - to kind of balance you out you know
25:28 - in general so meditation is one way to
25:31 - do that right meditation you go sit down
25:34 - 20 minutes meditate relax you know focus
25:37 - on one thing and that is it
25:38 - that's one thing another thing you can
25:40 - do for example another thing you can do
25:42 - for example i personally for me that
25:44 - works as i go for a run
25:46 - like i go ahead i go for a really quick
25:48 - run you know 10 20 minutes
25:50 - i come back take a shower i am all good
25:52 - and i'm so ready
25:54 - like i'm ready to take on the damn world
25:56 - seriously
25:57 - right and then with the run and then you
26:01 - know sometimes again
26:02 - uh and sometimes i'll do yoga so yoga
26:03 - helps me out as well
26:05 - but before we continue on i just want to
26:06 - show this really quick guys guys check
26:08 - this out you see this clock
26:09 - check out this clock right here this is
26:12 - in terms of time management
26:13 - for example let's say you're doing your
26:15 - things in like minutes right
26:17 - this clock for example you say hey i'm
26:19 - about to i will go ahead and i will do
26:21 - work for 30 minutes you said 30 minutes
26:23 - and it will tick to zero and then when
26:26 - it ticks to zero
26:27 - it will go ahead and beep an alarm and
26:29 - that is time for you to get up
26:31 - and start moving wow that's really
26:33 - really useful man
26:34 - right there see and just kind of move
26:36 - however however many minutes you want to
26:37 - kind of do so it's a really cool clock
26:39 - check this out guys just call it thing
26:40 - it's called like a time timer
26:42 - i think that's what it's called i
26:43 - actually love that it's a physical thing
26:45 - you know because
26:46 - yeah i've been so used to just using you
26:47 - know productivity apps so much that
26:49 - sometimes i kind of crave
26:50 - something that i can touch so that makes
26:52 - it a little bit more real for me i
26:54 - really appreciate that i love it
26:56 - so yeah you know going a little bit back
26:58 - into the whole time management thing
27:00 - it's a huge thing that a lot of us you
27:01 - know do end up
27:03 - kind of ignoring the psychological
27:05 - aspects of time management and stress
27:07 - relief all of these things
27:08 - and so like i said before you know
27:10 - pomodoro technique is super useful it's
27:12 - greatly used in a lot of different
27:14 - companies and just you know
27:16 - workplaces so one of the things that can
27:19 - help you actually with meditation
27:20 - if you are starting out it would be the
27:22 - headspace app
27:24 - so this app is really gold guys
27:27 - i love this app it's one of the best
27:29 - that i've ever used it's so minimalistic
27:30 - i love the design of it the branding of
27:32 - it too it just makes me feel so clean
27:35 - but you know other than that it's it's
27:37 - great if you do
27:38 - either want to have you know a guided
27:40 - meditation if you want to
27:42 - just have some mindfulness meditation
27:44 - you know different types of meditation
27:45 - what i do a lot is um when i'm working
27:48 - on a project whether that's a video or
27:49 - code itself
27:51 - i feel like you know trying to do
27:54 - visualization
27:55 - during meditation actually helps a lot
27:57 - in software especially if you're doing
27:59 - things like wireframing which we're
28:01 - going to touch in our other
28:03 - slides as well we're going to go a
28:04 - little bit deeper into that
28:06 - now what i'm going to talk about is
28:08 - actually what not
28:09 - talked about a little bit so you know
28:11 - meditation is that stress relief one of
28:13 - those
28:13 - would be running and i use running a lot
28:15 - too because
28:17 - like i said before guys you know if you
28:19 - are too engulfed in the thing that
28:21 - you're doing
28:22 - your attention just becomes a little bit
28:24 - closed down you know
28:25 - you're the way you're the way that you
28:27 - start thinking becomes
28:29 - very limited you are kind of not
28:31 - surrounded by different contexts and
28:32 - stuff
28:33 - so what helps out a lot is really going
28:35 - for a run you know you cannot ignore
28:37 - these psychological aspects of coding
28:39 - and working so that's going to be a huge
28:42 - one for you guys
28:44 - now the next thing that we want to touch
28:46 - we think it's a huge huge huge
28:49 - tool that every developer should use is
28:55 - command line guys as you guys know right
28:57 - command line that is
28:59 - it's the basics it is is as developers
29:02 - and what we use every single day
29:04 - right and the thing is like here's the
29:05 - thing guys let's listen up
29:07 - really closely here this is not some
29:09 - magic this is not some
29:11 - magic you know this is not some
29:13 - like high-level
29:14 - advanced stuff this is actually pretty
29:17 - basic
29:18 - okay and there is the reason why it's
29:20 - pretty basic and we wrote down some
29:22 - basic things on the left-hand side which
29:24 - you can see right there
29:25 - so if you can go ahead uh circle the the
29:27 - things the left hand side
29:29 - right the command line is what kind of
29:30 - allows you to no no no no no not there
29:33 - there we go there we go so circle this
29:35 - like for example there
29:37 - right it is what allows you to for
29:39 - example to create directors it will
29:40 - allow you for example to view files
29:42 - and guys the main things the main things
29:46 - you need to know
29:47 - are the ones we have just went ahead and
29:50 - showed you right there that is it that
29:53 - is pretty much
29:54 - it guys cd change directory ls
29:57 - view of files cd uh dot dot slash go up
30:00 - a directory
30:01 - mkd a machine is make a directory
30:05 - vam right vm also very popular and then
30:07 - rm
30:08 - to remove files with those
30:12 - that's pretty much need to know right
30:15 - there's some other ones that are more
30:16 - advanced but that's it
30:17 - just know those and you're golden guys
30:20 - that's it
30:21 - exactly and once you know how to use
30:23 - these then you can just literally look
30:24 - up on google
30:25 - look for command line commands sheet
30:29 - and once you have that you're golden
30:30 - you're all set
30:32 - because i remember when i was picking up
30:34 - command line you know i was learning
30:35 - unix
30:36 - when i learned how to change directories
30:38 - and how to move files around directories
30:40 - or just rename them
30:42 - on a bulk or you know all of these
30:44 - different type of commands
30:45 - i felt like a hacker man i don't know
30:47 - about you but i felt like
30:49 - mr robot or something i loved it so you
30:52 - know
30:53 - frankie is a hacker you know
30:56 - frankie he's a hacker yeah so people you
30:58 - know think that you have to be
31:00 - super advanced to learn unix and bash
31:03 - scripting and all of these things but in
31:04 - reality it's
31:05 - it's very you know straightforward you
31:08 - know just look at a small tutorial
31:10 - and if you do you're going to be able to
31:11 - move around things really really fast
31:13 - so this does take me to my next point
31:16 - which i want to touch on
31:17 - which is going to be git so all
31:20 - developers
31:21 - really really need to know git or
31:23 - version
31:24 - or version control really so i know
31:27 - nas you've been working on a lot of
31:29 - startups you've also worked with
31:30 - a lot of different freelancers and stuff
31:32 - so what's your experience with
31:33 - git yeah i mean you
31:37 - there's there's not there's no way
31:38 - around it guys you have to learn
31:40 - you have to know how to use it okay it
31:42 - is called version control
31:44 - it is what kind of keeps your code in
31:46 - check and is what allows you to work
31:48 - with teams okay very important
31:50 - right so for example think of it as like
31:51 - you have your code think of it as like
31:54 - your code is you know is saved and you
31:57 - have
31:58 - every single change that you make to
31:59 - your code is recorded as well
32:02 - and so that way you know let's say you
32:04 - screw up which you will
32:06 - which was most likely you will i do all
32:08 - the time
32:09 - you'll scroll you're gonna screw up and
32:11 - then what's gonna happen is you wanna go
32:12 - back
32:13 - to revert your screw up right and so git
32:16 - allows you to do that kind of stuff
32:18 - and it allows you to see what other
32:19 - things you have done so
32:21 - again git um learn it you know
32:24 - know it use it and you you'll see it
32:27 - kind of as we go through this stuff guys
32:29 - it's it's so extremely easy like frankie
32:32 - let's go ahead and go to the next one go
32:33 - to next slide
32:36 - next slide next slide
32:39 - okay not that one okay that's fine okay
32:41 - yeah so
32:42 - yep go ahead these are just you know
32:44 - part of the command line so
32:46 - unix is the language of you know command
32:49 - line
32:50 - it's been used since the 1970s it's
32:52 - crazy that it's now still used
32:54 - windows uses unix for its command line
32:57 - that was actually very recent i think it
32:59 - happened about two to three years ago
33:01 - that they decided to change to unix but
33:03 - max command line does use unix
33:05 - and dash is really the language that is
33:07 - used by unix to do the scripting and all
33:10 - of these things
33:11 - so now we do want to touch on
33:14 - wireframing
33:15 - because wireframing is going to be an
33:17 - important asset an important
33:20 - particular process that you use for your
33:22 - web development and any type of
33:23 - development
33:24 - really was one of the first
33:27 - introductions that i have to wireframing
33:29 - so how do you use wireframing yourself
33:31 - man yeah
33:32 - so tell me guys what do you guys think
33:33 - average actually think what do you think
33:35 - wireframe is
33:36 - in the comments okay um but i'm gonna
33:38 - tell you right now so wireframe is
33:39 - simply just
33:40 - imagine you have an idea okay let's
33:43 - let's imagine this okay
33:44 - you got an idea for a startup okay you
33:46 - want to build facebook the next facebook
33:48 - okay
33:49 - you're building the next facebook okay
33:51 - it's great but
33:52 - hold on i have i have this thing that's
33:54 - in my mind
33:55 - how do i put it into something that i
33:58 - can see
34:00 - and so that my friends is where
34:02 - wireframing comes in
34:04 - you can see for example we have an app i
34:06 - know on on there okay
34:08 - and this app right we have simply for
34:10 - example we have the login page
34:12 - we have another different page and it's
34:14 - very basic
34:15 - okay doesn't have any images it's not
34:17 - colorful it's nothing
34:20 - but it does portray the idea of
34:23 - what the app is am i correct or not
34:27 - i am correct because i know this so
34:31 - so it portrays the idea of what it is
34:33 - think of it as like it's kind of like a
34:34 - an
34:34 - outline of what your app looks like so
34:37 - this is the first thing that you're
34:38 - gonna do
34:39 - when you first start out to build
34:42 - applications guys
34:43 - you know and this is something that we
34:45 - very highly teach
34:46 - also in our profit with javascript
34:49 - course
34:50 - which by the way link is in bio but um
34:54 - something we very highly teach and a lot
34:56 - of our students will come back to me and
34:57 - be like whoa
34:58 - thanks so much i finally understand how
35:01 - to co
35:02 - how to take an idea i have in my mind
35:05 - process it draw it out and actually
35:08 - execute on it to then see a result
35:12 - and so that it's why it's such an
35:13 - important part uh just
35:15 - you know learn it um try do a few
35:18 - different wireframes
35:19 - and you're gonna see just how easy it is
35:21 - yeah i think wireframing is really
35:23 - essential
35:23 - um for different reasons one of the
35:25 - reasons i think
35:27 - is because you're actually making your
35:28 - code practical and visual
35:30 - and so sometimes you know you're just
35:32 - coding around
35:33 - a project that you're thinking but you
35:35 - can never really visualize it so it ends
35:37 - up looking like crap
35:38 - or the user experience of the actual app
35:42 - or whatever
35:55 - or actually you know would the button
35:57 - look better in the middle or
35:59 - under you know so all of these things
36:01 - are things that you can work in
36:03 - on your wireframe and there's a few
36:05 - tools that we want to talk about in
36:07 - wireframing
36:08 - and so now we're going to jump into
36:10 - these can you talk a little bit about
36:11 - them you know
36:12 - i think you're here here are some of the
36:14 - tools guys that you want to use
36:16 - okay now the first tool and i'm going to
36:18 - start with the one at the bottom
36:20 - um it's going to be dryo right this it's
36:22 - it's the one that's free and it allows
36:25 - you to just kind of
36:26 - create wireframes very very easily okay
36:28 - it's free just
36:29 - check it out uh go on paid version
36:32 - go into paid version you have sketch
36:34 - which is the one on the left hand side
36:36 - and it has the kind of orange little
36:37 - icon
36:38 - okay um and then you have figma on the
36:41 - right hand side
36:42 - that one is a little that partially free
36:45 - thing about one
36:46 - and then you have envision which
36:48 - envision
36:49 - on the right hand side which is the one
36:50 - that has like the that red circle the
36:52 - red square
36:54 - that one what do you guys think that is
36:57 - that one is what actually allows you to
36:59 - upload your wireframe
37:01 - or your mockup we call it upload your
37:04 - mockup
37:04 - to online and share it with your client
37:07 - so if you guys have a client for example
37:09 - okay let's say you got a client you go
37:11 - ahead and simply just put that
37:13 - you know put your mock-up on envision
37:15 - and boom voila
37:16 - you're golden and then your clients can
37:18 - actually see your mock-up comment on it
37:20 - and so forth
37:21 - so great tools um check all them out i
37:25 - highly recommend if you're going to
37:26 - start with wireframing
37:27 - just do draw your use draw yo and you
37:29 - will be
37:30 - you'll be fine with that
37:35 - yeah style be it frank you have
37:37 - something to say in that
37:38 - so okay i can't hear your frankie
37:41 - so i know that figma right now is a very
37:44 - very popular tool
37:45 - for wireframing and the reason why figma
37:48 - is so great
37:49 - is not only because it's very easy to
37:51 - use a lot of
37:52 - web developers and web designers are
37:54 - using it right now the
37:56 - fact that whatever you do end up
37:58 - designing in figma
37:59 - then you can just actually get the css
38:01 - and html code from actual
38:03 - figma on how you you know prototyped it
38:06 - then you can just paste it into your
38:08 - actual code so it's really efficient
38:10 - in you know coding in general because
38:13 - not only do you
38:14 - end up building something visually you
38:16 - can actually use it very practically
38:19 - with code so figma which is this icon
38:22 - right here
38:24 - is a great great tool for wireframing
38:26 - it's one of our most
38:27 - used ones for for sure so draw io
38:32 - it's also very important i even use draw
38:34 - io for other type of projects
38:36 - i use it to whenever i'm doing ad
38:37 - campaigns or things of the sort for the
38:39 - business
38:40 - you know i use draw io so that i can
38:42 - manage how my campaigns are looking you
38:44 - know
38:45 - if i'm trying to run it to you know
38:47 - either warm audiences or people that
38:49 - don't know
38:49 - us anything of like anything of the sort
38:52 - i just kind of map it out and draw
38:53 - io is actually a thing that helps me
38:56 - hugely so you guys can
38:58 - start using it and you can get creative
39:00 - in the way that you use it
39:02 - yeah and then one other thing i want to
39:04 - mention you guys really quickly here
39:05 - is is actually somebody mentioned i
39:07 - think let me see who oh
39:09 - devon gray he mentioned adobe xd we
39:12 - forgot to put on there adobe xd guys
39:15 - it's free and it's also like sketch or
39:18 - sigma
39:18 - so yeah check that out adobe isd uh easy
39:21 - to use
39:21 - free but also great
39:25 - awesome yeah yeah adobe street is super
39:27 - powerful so
39:29 - they always come up with good software
39:30 - and everything adobe's adobe
39:32 - envision is great like not said now
39:35 - i'm going to lead into our other thing
39:37 - that our other tool that i feel is going
39:40 - to be
39:40 - very important for all developers when i
39:42 - learned it i was like whoa
39:44 - what what was i doing i was i was coding
39:46 - everything from scratch it's not
39:47 - the most ideal thing to do so now we
39:50 - want to touch
39:51 - on what
39:56 - i don't get that frankie i don't i don't
39:57 - get this i don't know it's funny man
39:59 - come on i didn't like this gift but dude
40:02 - it's libraries and frameworks and then
40:04 - you can see bella here bill is super
40:06 - happy to use libraries as you can see
40:08 - nas is not apparently
40:09 - but you know bella is having the time of
40:11 - her life
40:12 - just you know moving around the library
40:15 - so
40:15 - who's with me on this one you guys you
40:17 - guys get this because i don't get
40:19 - i'm sorry i love it man so you know
40:22 - going deeper into libraries
40:24 - whenever when i discovered libraries or
40:27 - frameworks you know
40:28 - i was starting out with javascript and
40:30 - then i was trying to build a website
40:32 - that can
40:32 - that actually in the beginning of the
40:34 - website it had a
40:36 - it was a an actual what are they called
40:39 - slide shows they're called
40:40 - so for a moment in time websites had a
40:43 - lot of slide shows in the beginning like
40:44 - the front
40:45 - the big portion of it and i was like wow
40:47 - i wanted to sign a website that looks
40:48 - like that
40:49 - and so i was like how am i going to code
40:51 - up a slideshow
40:52 - i was i was very much a beginner at that
40:54 - point i still kind of am
40:55 - and so you know i was like okay i don't
40:58 - want to
40:58 - i don't want to do this from scratch
41:00 - what do i do then i discovered jquery
41:02 - which is a framework for javascript and
41:05 - what that allowed me to do was to go
41:08 - into
41:08 - the jquery library and check out some
41:11 - code
41:12 - that other people had written so that i
41:14 - can reuse their code for a slideshow
41:16 - and that's exactly what i did and man i
41:19 - ended up loving
41:20 - it i never went back and i really
41:22 - couldn't believe
41:23 - the fact that i didn't know about this
41:24 - and i was writing all my code from
41:26 - scratch
41:27 - what's your experience with this yeah i
41:29 - would say
41:30 - guys guys i mean i actually really funny
41:33 - enough guys i
41:34 - started coding and like making websites
41:37 - you know with the dreamweaver
41:38 - dreamweaver okay now if you guys don't
41:41 - know what that is let's just say
41:43 - it's not good and you should not be
41:44 - using it okay but this is basically
41:46 - you're gonna write vanilla javascript
41:48 - vanilla html
41:50 - all that stuff right you're gonna use
41:52 - and you're not going to reuse
41:54 - code at all and so i was literally
41:57 - copying pasting like
41:59 - every single page like every single page
42:02 - copy and pasting for every new page
42:04 - that's it's not something you want to do
42:06 - okay so when you guys for example let's
42:09 - say you learned some javascript when you
42:11 - guys have gone into
42:12 - learning vanilla javascript okay when
42:15 - you got into learning you know
42:16 - html css you kind of know all those the
42:20 - foundation
42:21 - which you kind of need to know okay once
42:24 - you've
42:24 - you kind of learned that then it's time
42:26 - for you to get into for example like
42:27 - react
42:28 - or like angular or start to use for
42:30 - example like jquery
42:31 - okay then you want to move into those
42:33 - specific frameworks
42:36 - because that my friends is when you
42:38 - start to build
42:39 - humongous and scalable applications okay
42:43 - javascript javascript and all that is
42:45 - still a foundation but that is where you
42:46 - start to build
42:48 - yep yes exactly so like uh kind of how
42:50 - kind of how
42:52 - um kind of how frankie here is showing
42:54 - us here so we have
42:56 - best javascript frameworks and libraries
42:58 - and tools um
42:59 - you know jquery on the left hand side
43:01 - jquery kind of came along
43:03 - a long time ago then we have react they
43:05 - came along they have angularjs that came
43:06 - along
43:07 - and and so forth now what i would
43:10 - recommend is you know your next question
43:11 - might be is like
43:12 - what's on like what do you think they're
43:13 - going to ask and ask next what's the
43:16 - best framework to start with
43:18 - exactly what is the best phone to start
43:20 - with
43:21 - so guys what is the best camera to start
43:24 - with
43:26 - there a best framework i don't know
43:30 - i don't think so but what we recommend
43:33 - is what what do we recommend frankie
43:35 - at the end of the day man it's really
43:37 - what you want to use that framework for
43:40 - so you know if you are trying to
43:43 - you know go front end and you know build
43:47 - a website
43:47 - anything like that i think react would
43:49 - be a good framework to start with
43:51 - you know sonny and kazzy have been
43:52 - making really really crazy builds with
43:54 - react
43:55 - recently you know if you do want to work
43:57 - a little bit more on
43:58 - back end then you would use node so
44:02 - all of these are a little bit similar
44:03 - but a little bit different it does
44:05 - depend a lot on
44:06 - what you're trying to do with them so
44:08 - you know that
44:09 - really in essence is going to dictate
44:12 - what
44:12 - type of framework or library you're
44:14 - going to end up using
44:15 - so like nas said at the end of the day
44:18 - stick to one
44:19 - you know try to master
44:31 - you know if you do end up going into a
44:33 - bunch of them and you go to react
44:35 - very deeply into angular really deeply
44:37 - and then you know really deeply
44:38 - then at the end of the day you might not
44:40 - pick up anything right so
44:42 - try to specialize on one at least yeah
44:44 - start with one pick one guys i guess so
44:46 - many questions like
44:47 - hey you know what's the best one is
44:49 - angular is it react you know
44:51 - is it moon you know you know you know i
44:54 - don't know i don't know
44:55 - uh but pick one you know pick react for
44:59 - example and then just go with it
45:01 - definitely definitely so now this takes
45:04 - us to our next point and
45:05 - another great great great developer tool
45:08 - kit that people can use is going to be
45:13 - chrome extensions
45:18 - yeah oh yeah guys i love this gift guys
45:20 - i mean guys i mean you agree with me gif
45:23 - you agree with me on this gift i know i
45:25 - know if you agree with me let me know in
45:27 - the comments below i know you agree with
45:28 - me
45:29 - but so chrono sanchez here those are the
45:32 - top ones that i personally use and
45:33 - you know we personally use and i like
45:36 - and definitely something that
45:38 - for you to check out so so number one
45:41 - number one is momentum do you know
45:43 - momentum is frankie
45:45 - yeah man i love it it's super
45:46 - motivational i just opened chrome and
45:48 - it's like hey
45:49 - you are the best in the world i'm like
45:50 - yes yeah
45:52 - frankie you are the best in the world
45:54 - frankie thank you guys guys
45:56 - put in the comments below frankie's the
45:57 - best in the world put in the comments
45:59 - below come on let's do it
46:00 - get some motivational speeches out here
46:05 - but can you actually show to them can
46:07 - you actually show them like an example
46:08 - yeah let me see
46:09 - i think actually has it here in his
46:11 - computer so
46:13 - let's pop it up so every time that you
46:16 - open up can you guys see this yes
46:20 - so every time you open up a new tab on
46:22 - chrome then you can see
46:23 - the time and then you can see you know
46:26 - quote
46:27 - be patient since this is computer this
46:30 - is what it says for him
46:32 - and then right here you can either type
46:33 - you know what it asks you what is your
46:35 - main focus for today so today i'm going
46:37 - to put
46:37 - live stream you know you can do a little
46:40 - to do note
46:41 - right there it also gives you the let me
46:44 - see i'm going to pull up
46:45 - my brush here so it also gives you the
46:48 - weather and then the city that you're in
46:50 - as well as a motivational code on
46:53 - the bottom as well so right here you can
46:55 - also do to do's as well
46:57 - why do you like momento so much momentum
47:00 - yeah i guess interestingly enough but
47:02 - seriously frankie i discovered it like
47:04 - not too long ago
47:05 - not too long ago literally like probably
47:07 - like two weeks ago
47:09 - but there's just it's clean it's so nice
47:11 - it just makes you feel warm you know it
47:12 - makes it feel like
47:13 - it's cozy nice
47:17 - yeah yeah yeah you know you go into your
47:18 - chrome and it's like it's all white or
47:20 - you just see the google logo
47:22 - it kind of doesn't
47:29 - just because you know you can see good
47:30 - landscapes it motivates you it tells you
47:32 - the time makes you aware of where you're
47:34 - at right now
47:35 - so i feel like it's yeah it's very
47:37 - soothing
47:38 - exactly okay so what is what is this
47:41 - weaponizer because i know that you added
47:43 - this because you really
47:45 - what what okay never mind you really
47:47 - love this
47:48 - yeah guys is a very useful for example
47:52 - um let's say you want to know like what
47:54 - technologies a specific
47:56 - site is using okay so opalizer if you
47:59 - actually
48:00 - so you can probably open chrome can you
48:02 - open up wobblizer chrome extension
48:07 - yeah just search up wapolize or chrome
48:08 - extension and you get you'll see what i
48:10 - mean
48:11 - but mobilizer yeah
48:17 - chrome extension yeah there we go
48:22 - yeah that's the one
48:27 - here so yeah so if you scroll down you
48:30 - see that the screenshot right there
48:31 - right
48:32 - so this shows no no not there the
48:33 - screenshot right there so
48:35 - just no not the screenshot frankie
48:37 - that's the screenshot that
48:38 - so you're using the screenshot okay now
48:40 - screenshot i'm not bad
48:44 - um so here you can see
48:47 - what it does is it shows you all the
48:49 - technologies
48:50 - that a specific website is using
48:53 - so for example let's go let's say you go
48:55 - on youtube okay
48:56 - and then youtube you want to see okay
48:59 - what technologies is this i using is it
49:01 - using shopify is it using wordpress
49:03 - um is it using react is it using angular
49:07 - right and so what this will do what
49:09 - vapolizer will do is it will tell you
49:11 - what technology is using and now
49:14 - remember specifically like back back
49:16 - in the day when i first kind of you know
49:17 - figuring everything out
49:19 - i used to look at okay what technologies
49:21 - is this side using yeah
49:22 - i was kind of doing my research you know
49:24 - kind of like haha
49:25 - these guys are using this okay then
49:27 - maybe i should learn this
49:29 - you know so like that's yeah that's very
49:31 - common actually among web developers and
49:33 - stuff
49:34 - this this actually does remind me of
49:36 - another tool that i use a lot that you
49:38 - actually reminded me of this so let's
49:39 - check it out it's called
49:41 - built with technologies
49:50 - if you go here and then let's say you go
49:53 - and put cleverprogrammer.com
49:56 - it's going to tell you all the tech
49:57 - stuff that is being used here all the
49:59 - extensions that are being used
50:00 - and everything so look at that you can
50:02 - see the deadline funnel you can see use
50:04 - proof
50:04 - funnelling google analytics
50:08 - even tells you the pixels guys so
50:11 - you know it even tells you the fonts you
50:13 - know you can see here
50:16 - google fonts give me one second right
50:18 - here google fonts
50:20 - cookie bar money manychat all of these
50:23 - things so
50:24 - these are great tools for when you're
50:26 - web developing and
50:28 - or you want to you're curious about what
50:29 - a you know
50:31 - website is built out of these are great
50:33 - great tools to figure that thing out
50:35 - yeah yeah
50:38 - so now i'm going to talk a little bit
50:39 - more about one tool that i really like
50:41 - so
50:42 - fonts ninja is an awesome awesome tool
50:44 - that i love for designing
50:46 - one of the ways that i use it is you
50:49 - know i actually
50:50 - heard about this i was in an extension
50:54 - what was it a conference in nashville
50:56 - tennessee called funnel hacking live
50:58 - and this web designer girl who has made
51:02 - millions of dollars in cloning websites
51:04 - so
51:05 - she looks at the websites that convert
51:06 - the most that sell the most
51:08 - then she picks them apart and redesigns
51:11 - them
51:11 - and builds websites just like those so
51:15 - exactly so one of the tools that they
51:17 - would use would be
51:18 - fun ninja ninja and then what funds
51:21 - ninja is gonna allow you to do is
51:23 - actually
51:24 - when you scroll over when when you hover
51:26 - over a text you can just highlight it
51:28 - like if you highlight it
51:29 - it's gonna tell you exactly what font is
51:31 - used so you can
51:32 - then go ahead and go to google fonts or
51:34 - something and download it from there
51:36 - and another tool that i added here as
51:39 - well that i actually
51:40 - liked a lot and i actually heard it from
51:43 - that same conference from that same girl
51:46 - who was a master designer is eye color
51:49 - picker so this is another chrome
51:50 - extension that i
51:52 - greatly really love you can just hit the
51:55 - extension
51:56 - and then go to a color that you like on
51:58 - the website
51:59 - and it's going to tell you the hex code
52:00 - a bit so whenever you do want to use
52:02 - that hex code that color specifically
52:05 - then you can just you know grab it from
52:07 - there put it
52:08 - either on photoshop put it on your code
52:10 - or anything related to that
52:13 - yeah so i'm not sure what this one is
52:15 - can you tell me a little bit more about
52:17 - now
52:17 - it looks good i don't know what the text
52:19 - is not
52:20 - on there but guys this my friends this

53:35 - it does
53:36 - okay what it does is it actually will go
53:39 - ahead
53:40 - and let's say you have like a thousand
53:41 - tabs open not okay let's say you have 20
53:43 - tabs open that's more
53:44 - more realistic okay let's say you have
53:46 - 20 tabs open
53:47 - what it's going to do is it's going to
53:50 - go ahead
53:51 - and it's going to kill or pause
53:54 - tabs that have been open and not
53:57 - used for a long time so basically tabs
54:00 - who are kind of stale there or just not
54:02 - used
54:03 - it's going to pause the tab it's going
54:05 - to actually screenshot it
54:07 - so they so that when you go back to the
54:09 - tab you can see the
54:10 - the actual um screenshot but it's not
54:13 - actually
54:14 - a site the site is not working just
54:16 - screenshot
54:18 - and so basically you can have basically
54:19 - you can be let's say you're active on
54:21 - one tab
54:21 - let's say you're active in one tab and
54:23 - let's say your 19 tabs are not active
54:26 - it's going to deactivate those tabs
54:28 - until you go back to the tab and then
54:30 - click on it to reload
54:31 - that my friends will fix your ram

56:04 - actually dribble
56:06 - um but yeah so dribble it's um

56:19 - maybe you're building an app
56:20 - i'm not sure um you want to kind of go
56:24 - out there and find some inspiration
56:25 - because that
56:25 - is how you actually you know that's how
56:27 - you actually get pointers on what you
56:29 - want to build
56:30 - um and so what i do is i literally go to
56:33 - dribble
56:35 - uh you have to go to dribble through
56:36 - google i don't know it's weird it's like
56:38 - go to go to dribble through google yeah

56:58 - designers you know people who created
57:01 - apps
57:02 - and they put this on here as a way to
57:04 - inspire you
57:05 - i know so you can for example take maybe
57:08 - certain parts and pieces
57:09 - and ideas and kind of implement that
57:11 - into your
57:12 - own application like
57:16 - so for example let's say you build a
57:17 - portfolio site okay um you can literally
57:19 - search a portfolio site
57:21 - and it will give you amazing designs or
57:23 - portfolio sites
57:25 - let's say you're building an app let's
57:26 - say you're building a facebook app type
57:28 - in facebook app and it will give you
57:29 - examples
57:30 - of like i don't mean just generic
57:33 - examples i mean amazing beautifully

57:43 - this one out
57:44 - devon grace says dribble with three b's
57:47 - so that was the year

57:57 - dibble sounds fun though
57:59 - yeah yo guys the thing about dribble
58:02 - that is really cool
58:03 - to me it's kind of like the pinterest
58:05 - for developers you know
58:06 - whenever right now we're moving to
58:08 - another house it's going to be a great
58:10 - house we're going to record a lot of
58:11 - videos there
58:12 - but you know one thing that i do a lot
58:15 - is
58:15 - go into pinterest for inspiration
58:17 - whether that's you know interior design
58:19 - just app development in general because
58:21 - actually a lot of
58:22 - apps are on a lot of app design is on
58:25 - pinterest as well so you guys can check
58:27 - that one out as well
58:28 - but it does remind me a lot of dribbble
58:30 - dribble also has a lot of icons so
58:32 - you know if you're trying to look for
58:34 - icons for your app kind of like material
58:36 - ui
58:37 - has like most of the most frameworks do
58:39 - or a lot of mentalities do have
58:41 - their their own icons that you know you
58:43 - don't have to download them because
58:45 - you know everybody hates downloading a
58:48 - png or a logo that has a background
58:50 - there and you can
58:51 - you know actually make it look cool so
58:53 - you know dribble is going to be the
58:54 - place where you can find all of these

59:32 - how a site should look like right so
59:35 - let's say you believe maybe like
59:36 - for example i had a client and the
59:39 - client i was building from the client i

59:43 - um this was a real estate site
59:46 - okay a real estate site and i was trying
59:49 - to get some inspiration on kind of what
59:50 - should i should it look like
59:52 - so what i literally did is i literally
59:54 - went on here
59:55 - and i searched for for um a real estate
59:59 - sites
60:00 - and they give me amazing examples okay
60:03 - so like

60:25 - let's pull it up so i've never seen
60:27 - lappa it seems like
60:28 - this might be very helpful for a lot of
60:30 - people so let's dive a little bit into
60:32 - it
60:33 - so what do you do you search here
60:35 - something like real estate yeah so
60:37 - let's say for example popular this week

60:40 - portfolios or like let's say you
60:42 - type in e-commerce landing pages you see
60:44 - that
60:46 - e-commerce uh no right there there's a
60:47 - button right there right there right
60:49 - there
60:49 - no it's selected there's a there's like
60:52 - a popular this one i see it i see it
60:53 - here it is e-commerce landing pages nice
60:58 - drop down in the comments below guys if
60:59 - you guys want to see a build of an
61:01 - e-commerce store
61:02 - with kazi or sunny or nas and all of
61:06 - these great developers that we have on
61:07 - our platform
61:08 - drop it down in the comments below let's
61:10 - do it let's do it man
61:12 - so what's up with this yeah so for
61:15 - example here so scroll down keep
61:17 - scrolling
61:20 - i mean look at these amazing so click on
61:22 - so click on one for example let's say
61:23 - click on the plastic is a no-go
61:28 - click on that one i'm gonna look at it
61:31 - just i mean
61:31 - it's so beautifully designed okay um
61:35 - so beautiful design and then you can you
61:37 - can actually go ahead and visit the site
61:39 - so click visit the site
61:43 - so it's not it's not only that it's the
61:46 - design of the website that you're
61:47 - looking at it also
61:49 - shows you the real sites where it's
61:51 - posted
61:52 - yeah sometimes sometimes yes sometimes
61:54 - no it seems like this might be a little
61:55 - bit
61:56 - old or just you know not in service
61:58 - right now so it's
61:59 - actually not loading but i guess a few
62:02 - of them will load
62:03 - yeah some of them below some of them
62:04 - will not but guys like
62:07 - this is i mean look how nice of this
62:08 - design like people really thought about
62:10 - this okay
62:11 - so i literally would go through this and
62:13 - this will give me inspiration
62:14 - how i i want to go ahead and actually
62:17 - build
62:18 - my site just like that yep some of the
62:21 - things that i like about this too
62:22 - that is kind of a lot of people don't
62:24 - know but you know whenever you are
62:26 - looking at designs
62:27 - like this you have to pay attention to
62:29 - the color palettes that they're being
62:31 - used
62:31 - because sometimes designers suck just
62:34 - because they don't know how to work with
62:35 - color
62:36 - and so one of the things that i would
62:37 - tell you if you're a designer go and
62:39 - study color theory man
62:41 - go and study color theory because once
62:44 - you know
62:44 - those basics then you can just play
62:46 - around with everything but if you don't
62:47 - know color theory
62:48 - you're gonna be you know mixing a bunch
62:50 - of tertiary colors that don't look
62:53 - good you're gonna be mixing colors and
62:55 - end up getting brown
62:56 - you're gonna be you know doing weird
62:58 - things with color sometimes what i see
63:00 - when people don't know anything about
63:01 - color theory is that
63:02 - they use very powerful colors like right
63:05 - next to each other
63:06 - so they use something like you know
63:08 - orange and then green and then like
63:10 - really royal blue and all these colors
63:12 - that are so strong but
63:14 - they don't really look good together so
63:16 - yeah one of the biggest hacks that i've
63:17 - seen
63:18 - is you know looking at other people's
63:19 - designs so that i can copy their color
63:21 - palettes because
63:22 - i'm always trying to get better with
63:23 - color and design in general
63:25 - and also i think one important is it it
63:27 - trains your eye
63:29 - like right design is a very subjective
63:32 - thing you know one
63:33 - one person might like it another person
63:35 - might not
63:37 - so you know by by going and looking
63:39 - about some amazing designs
63:41 - you're starting to train your eye and
63:42 - start to train your eye on what
63:44 - something looks you know amazing like
63:46 - what something looks
63:47 - you know the way it should be things
63:49 - like that so
63:50 - um literally you know you gotta do this
63:52 - kind of stuff and you guys building
63:54 - maybe you guys are building a project
63:55 - maybe you guys are building your own
63:57 - portfolio site
63:58 - look at designs see what other people
64:00 - have done and then build it
64:02 - okay i that's i always tell that to all
64:04 - the students
64:06 - so asks
64:09 - color theory is this a thing yes my
64:11 - friend color theory is a thing that a
64:13 - lot of
64:14 - artists actually study so you're
64:16 - starting
64:17 - you know you're starting to go into
64:18 - painting you're starting to go into
64:20 - design
64:20 - anything in the sort color theory it's
64:22 - what it's called so you guys can just
64:24 - google that
64:28 - yeah search up on google search up color
64:30 - palette
64:31 - there's a certain website that i like to
64:32 - use for color palettes
64:35 - color palettes
64:40 - i think it's like yeah go ahead search
64:41 - that up
64:43 - uh first one um no no second one second
64:46 - one colors colors dot co
64:47 - second one colors dot co yeah
64:51 - so even right here guys you can see you
64:54 - know it's crazy let's let's
64:55 - let's look at this so i just googled
64:57 - color palettes and what we can see here
65:00 - is you know the use of the word and the
65:03 - search
65:04 - you know the search term ultimately has
65:07 - been growing the last
65:09 - years so as the design starts to get
65:12 - bigger and more popular people are
65:14 - actually searching
65:16 - the word more you know it seems like in
65:18 - 2003 it was a
65:19 - it was a big you know search it was very
65:22 - popular
65:23 - but now in 2017 and up it's going insane
65:26 - and you know we can even see that a lot
65:28 - of the developments nowadays
65:30 - is going into fun and development and
65:32 - just you know web development in general
65:35 - so in essence you know design
65:38 - became a super vital role in development
65:41 - itself so yeah now let's jump into
65:44 - the actual colors.com yeah so click
65:47 - start the generator
65:49 - start the generator and look at that
65:52 - these are your color palettes
65:54 - so you can you know
65:58 - wow so click click space click space
66:02 - oh wow man and it will it will change
66:04 - color palettes
66:05 - and then you can actually put in your
66:06 - colors too so for example let's say you
66:08 - have
66:08 - another color you simply click on double
66:11 - click for example on 8c
66:12 - 868 click on that one for example double
66:14 - click on it
66:16 - right double click on the 8c the actual
66:19 - number
66:20 - double click on number number number
66:21 - number click on the number there we go
66:24 - and change to a different color for
66:25 - example um you know
66:28 - uh click on the yeah the the square
66:31 - the square not the square the square
66:33 - yeah
66:35 - oh it can't okay f
66:38 - f f f no do like f f f
66:42 - there we go decline hit enter so what
66:50 - you can lock that color so lock it for
66:51 - example lock that color you see there's
66:53 - a lock button
66:53 - nice lock it now click space now check
66:56 - this out
66:57 - oh wow we'll find colors that you know a
67:01 - color palette around those colors
67:04 - like that now that my friends is is
67:07 - is very very useful
67:11 - okay so keep clicking space and you will
67:13 - see start to see more color palettes
67:14 - more color palettes and so forth
67:16 - so the thing that i like about this is
67:19 - you know
67:20 - a huge thing about color palettes is
67:22 - palette colors that go together
67:24 - that you know that's why it's called a
67:25 - palette so what i like about this
67:28 - specifically
67:29 - is the fact that you know you got to
67:30 - think about the
67:32 - sort of the feeling that a color gives
67:34 - you right so
67:35 - orange and yellow or more kind of like
67:37 - an important
67:38 - type of you know vibe so it gives you
67:41 - something to look at it's kind of like a
67:42 - warning sign you know warning signs are
67:44 - this color
67:45 - kind of like danger all of these so
67:47 - orange
67:48 - and colors theory orange is the opposite
67:50 - of blue so
67:51 - you're pairing up different shades of
67:53 - blue with different shades of orange or
67:54 - yellow
67:58 - itself so all of these are going to be
68:00 - very useful for you when you're building
68:01 - things as well
68:03 - yeah and so and somebody and you guys
68:05 - asked like you know
68:06 - does color theory work i mean
68:10 - yes color color theory works guys i mean
68:13 - look at the lights
68:14 - like look at look at our for example
68:16 - lights stop lights okay
68:18 - right why do we have red as this
68:21 - light for stop and why do we have green
68:23 - as the light to go
68:25 - because genetically evolutionary
68:29 - red means bad red means stop blood
68:32 - et cetera et cetera exactly red means
68:34 - blood red means stop man ransom means no
68:36 - no go
68:37 - red means warning versus green means
68:41 - money green means do it green means go
68:45 - exactly so
68:49 - that's why it does you know and it's all
68:52 - psychology um it's very important guys
68:55 - exactly there's a reason why you know
68:57 - facebook is blue why
68:59 - linkedin is blue all of these companies
69:01 - are blue blue is you know trust so
69:03 - we can dive into this a little bit
69:08 - a lot of people are developers that are
69:10 - designers as well
69:11 - and they don't know psychology of colors
69:14 - by the way guys smash that like button
69:16 - for us we have
69:18 - i i know you i think we're giving you
69:20 - guys some amazing stuff
69:22 - out here so smash that like button how
69:23 - many likes do we have right now i don't
69:25 - know i'm not sure
69:25 - i think we have like i think we have
69:27 - like 400 or 500
69:29 - let's smash it up you know hit that hit
69:32 - it you know just kind of
69:33 - double click it triple click it hit that
69:35 - smash button
69:36 - guys thank you thank you for being here
69:39 - so right here i'm going to show you guys
69:41 - a little bit of the color psychology
69:43 - right so like i said before blue is
69:46 - equal to
69:46 - trust let me write down a little bit let
69:48 - me see if i can actually
69:50 - zoom in a little bit more for you guys
69:53 - so here right you know it shows that
69:57 - blue
69:57 - is trust peace loyalty and competence so
70:00 - most of the big companies that you guys
70:02 - see are actually blue you know twitter
70:04 - facebook linkedin like i said all of
70:06 - these are blue
70:07 - it doesn't mean that you can't have any
70:08 - other colors it just means that it's
70:10 - very used
70:11 - because of this fact and then you know
70:14 - green
70:14 - is more of that nature field you know
70:17 - sometimes you even have a
70:18 - plant that is a fake plant and it makes
70:20 - you feel like you know it's alive like
70:22 - you're in nature
70:23 - so green really does make you feel like
70:25 - this sort of
70:26 - healing type of vibe to it so a lot of
70:29 - apps
70:30 - like the stay focused app which is
70:32 - something that i use for productivity
70:34 - it's actually a pomodoro
70:35 - app as well uses green a lot
70:38 - then you know yellow can be happiness
70:40 - warmth all of these warm colors
70:42 - are you know they call it warm colors
70:46 - because they make you feel some sort of
70:47 - feeling of warmth
70:49 - love you know why
70:52 - why is that do you know why i don't know
70:54 - man even
70:55 - you know even you can see if you do
70:58 - dissect a bunch of painters like picasso
71:00 - and all of these guys they had different
71:02 - sorts of seasons in their paintings so
71:04 - picasso had a specific season in his
71:07 - painting
71:08 - where they call it literally called the
71:10 - blue period where this guy was creating
71:12 - so much specific like sad and impressive
71:16 - moments
71:17 - although blue is you know trust peace
71:19 - and loyalty
71:20 - it can also symbolize cold so
71:23 - being cold is kind of sad
71:29 - so these are warmer colors and these
71:32 - green
71:32 - blue pink and purple are
71:35 - the the fresh colors so they're actually
71:39 - more cold if you're trying to
71:40 - go in for a more cold look you can use
71:42 - purple you can use
71:44 - blue but you know you got to be aware of
71:46 - that that's why they use the
71:47 - the actual you know the quote that says
71:49 - something like i'm feeling blue today
71:51 - or i'm blue
72:01 - yeah but like i think um so you know i
72:04 - think the reason why it's actually like
72:05 - for example
72:06 - blue not blue but like yellow orange and
72:08 - red like make you feel warm
72:10 - um because guys look at the sun
72:15 - what color is the sun it's yellow it's
72:17 - orange
72:18 - okay and what does it make us do it
72:21 - makes us feel
72:22 - warm and so like it's it's so crazy to
72:25 - think about this but this is all
72:27 - from like hundreds and thousands of
72:30 - years ago that we have built this
72:31 - association with the fact that
72:33 - blue not blue but yellow for example or
72:35 - orange means
72:36 - warm colors like it's it's just insane
72:40 - to think about that but again it's all
72:42 - because of like you know evolution
72:43 - evolution and kind of how we
72:45 - were raised and you know how people we
72:48 - changed
72:49 - and sun i think had a really big part in
72:51 - that meeting
72:53 - so it's just something to think about
72:54 - yep and it's all part of nature you know
72:56 - so
72:57 - yeah green part of nature blue ocean is
73:00 - blue
73:00 - you know pink your flowers are pink i
73:04 - don't know
73:05 - so all of these things are there so you
73:07 - know daniel
73:08 - does bring a good question and he says
73:11 - nas
73:11 - is there any resource or course you can
73:13 - recommend for a developer who wants to
73:15 - learn basics of ui and ux
73:18 - um we're gonna learn basics of ui and ux
73:21 - um
73:22 - i mean trying to learn basics of
73:23 - javascript and a great
73:25 - ui development profile javascript is one
73:28 - of them
73:29 - link in description um but
73:32 - if you want to use for example just ui
73:34 - ux
73:36 - we don't have a course on that for
73:38 - example from clever programmer
73:39 - but there are amazing youtube videos on
73:42 - ui ux design
73:43 - and there's a lot you know udemy or
73:47 - youtube videos a lot of courses on that
73:49 - um i would highly recommend the best way
73:51 - to actually learn uiux is honestly just
73:53 - simply through practice
73:55 - so go to for example like dribble
73:58 - so one of my friends actually for the
73:59 - way he learned is
74:01 - he would go to dribble he would sort
74:03 - something up he would see
74:04 - you know for example like maybe it's his
74:06 - app and he would take that app and he
74:08 - would design it by himself the exact
74:10 - same design
74:11 - and then he will then he will change it
74:13 - you know some minor things
74:15 - and so as he did more and more and more
74:17 - that stuff he kind of started to get
74:18 - understanding
74:19 - and uh of what things are and what
74:22 - things should look like
74:24 - um so it all kind of just comes from
74:26 - practice
74:27 - but if you want to take a course you
74:28 - know youtube is a great resource you
74:30 - know udem is a great resource
74:32 - and if you're not actually learning
74:33 - great design together with us uh
74:35 - together with development
74:36 - then profit with javascript is another
74:38 - amazing
74:39 - resource yep yep so
74:42 - i'd say you know guys dive into creating
74:45 - your own projects dive into
74:47 - actually copying or modeling great
74:50 - companies
74:51 - out there so a great way to practice ui
74:54 - ux design
74:55 - would be to study companies like apple
74:57 - study you know how they make their apps
74:59 - how they make their fitness app
75:00 - how they make the alarm clock app i
75:02 - think i heard
75:03 - i don't know if it was um either tim
75:05 - cook or steve jobs who said something
75:08 - like
75:09 - we're trying to get all functionalities
75:11 - to work
75:12 - inside of three clicks you know three
75:15 - clicks of your button on the screen yeah
75:17 - so i don't know exactly who that was but
75:20 - that's actually a very
75:21 - good point to actually talk about
75:23 - because and when you're designing you
75:25 - know sometimes people think of these
75:27 - like super complex designs of things of
75:29 - their apps
75:30 - and they're trying to build a huge like
75:32 - oh yeah an experience where you can
75:33 - click here and click here and click here
75:35 - but that just makes your app not being
75:36 - not easy to use you know
75:38 - at the end of the day if your app has a
75:40 - bad experience user experience
75:42 - and also user interface people are not
75:44 - going to use it no matter
75:45 - what no matter what type of thing your
75:47 - app does or tries to
75:48 - yes it's all about balancing and i tell
75:51 - this to a lot of students it's all about
75:52 - balancing user experience
75:54 - um like ease ease of use with
75:58 - a great design you know because you can
76:01 - have amazing you can have you know some
76:02 - complex design for example
76:04 - you know you have some compass design
76:06 - where like you hover over something and
76:08 - then
76:08 - and then it displays some text
76:11 - but then you gotta ask the question is
76:14 - this actually useful
76:15 - or is this actually difficult for the
76:17 - user user to to use
76:19 - um i actually i learned this really cool
76:21 - trick
76:22 - uh this really cool trick um at some
76:24 - point it was like
76:26 - the last brain power a user has to use
76:28 - to you
76:29 - for your application the better your app
76:31 - is going to do brain power
76:34 - and brain power is everything brain
76:36 - power is an extra click
76:38 - is an extra brain power right an extra
76:41 - even
76:42 - like hover over with your mouse is
76:45 - more brain power so the last brain power
76:48 - your user can
76:49 - use to see what what they want to see
76:54 - the better you'll do so let's just keep
76:55 - that in mind just keep that kind of like
76:57 - you know
76:57 - kind of like that seed always in your
77:00 - head
77:02 - awesome so i'm going to bring a few
77:04 - questions here now this one is a
77:07 - great question that the greatest ever
77:10 - brings up it's actually just kind of a
77:12 - comment
77:12 - or a statement he says e-commerce are
77:15 - great to have i have done a few and they
77:17 - always impress because they are also
77:18 - very practical
77:20 - so i feel like e-commerce projects are a
77:23 - great way to study
77:25 - two things design and then also web
77:27 - development
77:28 - it's actually one of our most asked for
77:30 - projects so we're probably going to dive
77:32 - into that in the next
77:33 - few live streams so nas i know you've
77:36 - you know worked with
77:37 - so many companies by now so do you have
77:40 - any experience building ecommerce sites
77:41 - yourself
77:42 - i have i have both an e-commerce site
77:44 - yes um
77:45 - and i mean it's fun one just one you
77:48 - know
77:49 - it's a it's a fun one because it
77:51 - involves a lot of
77:52 - a lot of functionalities right because
77:55 - you're not thinking you're not just
77:56 - building just a landing page
77:58 - you're building a page that will
77:59 - maintain products
78:01 - you'll build a page that will allow
78:03 - people to buy things
78:04 - that will allow people to check out that
78:06 - will allow people right
78:08 - to you know get shipping information um
78:12 - so i highly like this kind of project
78:13 - because there's just so many parts to it
78:15 - and then you know you're just going to
78:16 - learn like yeah your learning process is
78:18 - going to grow exponentially with it um
78:21 - but yeah yeah if you can if you want to
78:24 - build an ecommerce site
78:26 - i'll recommend that definitely
78:27 - definitely recommend that
78:29 - you know but at the end of the day like
78:31 - devin grace says is
78:33 - you know you do get decision fatigue if
78:36 - right now you know you're trying to
78:37 - build this you're trying to make that
78:39 - design
78:40 - you're trying to click here and you're
78:41 - trying to click there you know always
78:43 - simplify
78:44 - the variables that you're working with
78:46 - because and that goes into design that
78:48 - goes into productivity
78:50 - into app development you know everything
78:53 - that is secondary
78:54 - kind of leave it to the side and just
78:55 - focus on the primary
78:57 - and so you know that's a huge part of
78:59 - design and development in general
79:01 - so devin does bring up a good great
79:03 - point
79:04 - how did you go into development and
79:06 - designing specifically
79:08 - nas because i know that you know you're
79:10 - huge on it you're very good at it as
79:11 - well
79:12 - whether that's you know web app
79:13 - development or just
79:15 - you know designing in general like
79:16 - photoshop and stuff so
79:18 - yeah how was that for you um i think for
79:20 - me just kind of came from experience
79:22 - um i wrote i started out as a developer
79:25 - just kind of building some basic sites
79:26 - right
79:27 - and then what happened is as you build
79:30 - more sites as you build more
79:31 - applications
79:32 - um as you work you know with more
79:34 - companies
79:35 - you know you get to see great design
79:38 - right you work with other designers for
79:40 - example maybe there's you know a
79:42 - designer who's
79:43 - working at the company and you know he's
79:46 - showing you how to make a great design
79:48 - and so you get pointers from there and
79:51 - then you get pointers from a few
79:52 - different places
79:53 - and so forth and then and then dribble
79:55 - comes along you're like oh this is
79:56 - awesome
79:57 - you know and dribble came along and then
80:00 - everything was good
80:01 - and then you implement um kind of your
80:04 - design decisions and then you see how
80:06 - people react to them
80:07 - and and from that you kind of you learn
80:10 - and you
80:11 - you do pattern recognition um and
80:14 - and with that that kind of builds so
80:16 - yeah it all kind of came from experience
80:18 - guys
80:20 - definitely man that's that's awesome i
80:22 - know that
80:23 - right now a great you know this is just
80:25 - a bonus right here
80:27 - but and i'm not logged into my account
80:29 - or anything but envato
80:30 - is one of the biggest platforms for
80:32 - designers
80:33 - in the world right now and right here
80:36 - you can actually even get
80:37 - you know freelancing clients you can
80:39 - build your own portfolios
80:41 - and you know share your own creations
80:43 - with other people
80:44 - and envato is one of the biggest
80:46 - communities for designers like i said in
80:48 - the world
80:49 - so give that one a look it's kind of
80:50 - like dribble kind of like
80:53 - lapa like nas was saying so all of these
80:56 - are going to be
80:57 - inspirational tools they're going to be
80:59 - very valuable if you have on your
81:01 - tool set and you bring them up as skills
81:03 - because ultimately you have the tools
81:05 - but then you have to develop the skills
81:06 - to use the tools
81:07 - and you know at the end of the day the
81:10 - tools are just going to help you become
81:11 - more efficient you know the tools are
81:13 - not the end-all be-all
81:14 - but it's a good addition to things you
81:16 - know let's say
81:18 - you're trying to build a house without a
81:20 - hammer then what are you gonna do use a
81:21 - stone
81:22 - maybe but it's gonna be harder for you
81:23 - so just use a hammer don't use the stone
81:25 - guys don't use this don't use a hammer
81:28 - frankie will use a stone okay so
81:32 - yeah i'll use a stone yeah i'll be like
81:33 - patrick so
81:35 - don't mind me and in conclusion guys you
81:38 - know
81:38 - we put here uh really a quote from steve
81:41 - jobs we think this guy is super iconic
81:43 - we love you know his philosophy his
81:46 - design style
81:47 - and his products man we're working on
81:48 - max right now so that's that's pretty
81:50 - awesome
81:51 - and what does he say nas you cannot
81:54 - mandate productivity
81:55 - you must provide the tools to let people
81:57 - become their best
82:01 - right so what does that mean to you
82:05 - to me it means that to me it means that
82:08 - productivity like you can't force
82:10 - productivity you have to give people the
82:12 - right tools to be productive
82:14 - now example is like you know
82:18 - let's say you put people in an office
82:20 - that
82:21 - with slow computers and with
82:24 - no ac and a very horrible environment
82:27 - are they going to be productive
82:30 - no but if you pee but if you give people
82:32 - the right tools
82:34 - the right knowledge if you give people
82:35 - you know for example it maybe
82:37 - if you give um an artist you know
82:41 - amazing amazing paper and amazing
82:44 - pencils to draw with
82:45 - he's going to draw some amazing things
82:48 - if you give a developer
82:50 - a great computer that's a great computer
82:52 - that that you know you can you can you
82:54 - can use
82:55 - he's going to create some amazing things
82:59 - right if you give a um if you give
83:02 - um a contractor you know a contractor
83:05 - who fixes houses
83:06 - you give him all the right tools all the
83:09 - the drills
83:10 - all the you know all the things that to
83:12 - make his work faster and easier and
83:14 - better
83:15 - he's going to do amazing work and so
83:18 - that's how i see it
83:19 - because without those you know it's
83:22 - going to be a lot harder for you
83:24 - now they don't define you but it's going
83:26 - to be a lot harder for you yeah
83:28 - man i feel like you know tools are
83:31 - hugely important i never really
83:33 - understood the importance of them until
83:35 - i started working with this company to
83:36 - be honest
83:37 - you know i've been you know very
83:40 - into gadgets a lot so
83:44 - i understand it but in general i had
83:46 - never really applied
83:47 - tools into the workspace and once you do
83:50 - that man it's like
83:52 - you realize that something was missing
83:53 - you know yeah tools are essential for
83:56 - your growth
83:56 - because it's like having
84:00 - other type of senses so right now we
84:01 - have you know we can talk we can
84:04 - we can feel we can listen we can
84:07 - you know all of our senses we can see
84:09 - all of these things
84:10 - but tools really do you know extend the
84:13 - way that you
84:14 - interact with the world so whether
84:17 - that's through a
84:18 - community you know community tools
84:20 - trying to talk to people
84:22 - sharing your code using loom using all
84:23 - of these things that we talked about
84:25 - you know whether that's extensions for
84:29 - your you know text editor
84:31 - any of those things that simplify the
84:33 - way that you work
84:34 - with what you already have all of these
84:37 - things are just
84:38 - you know extensions of your own skills
84:41 - so applying them to an actual practical
84:44 - way is going to take you a long way and
84:46 - it's also going to differentiate you
84:48 - from other people
84:49 - but the cool thing is like you can show
84:51 - other people your tools
84:52 - and you can literally change their life
84:54 - so like i said before in this live
84:57 - stream guys
84:58 - time is the most important asset that we
85:00 - have you know money is always
85:01 - replenishable time is never
85:03 - replenishable
85:04 - so if you can find a tool that can you
85:06 - know minimize the time that you spend
85:08 - doing something
85:09 - that literally means that you're getting
85:11 - more life back
85:12 - so you're having more time for your life
85:14 - for other things that you
85:16 - want to actually do you know so all of
85:18 - these are
85:19 - some of the things that i think are
85:20 - important yeah
85:22 - yeah i would agree with that i know time
85:25 - is something you guys
85:26 - don't get back but one thing i want to
85:27 - mention it's very important guys
85:29 - for you is do not let tools also define
85:32 - you
85:32 - at the end of the day right you know
85:35 - it's not about getting the most tools
85:36 - you possibly can
85:38 - at the end of the day focus on the
85:40 - learning focus on the doing
85:42 - you know and let the tools kind of help
85:44 - you out let the tools kind of make you
85:45 - more efficient
85:47 - all right but as a developer
85:50 - as a developer you don't gotta you don't
85:52 - gotta need a bunch of tools right you
85:53 - don't gotta need
85:54 - all the tools in the world you need this
85:57 - which is what
85:58 - your brain that's the ultimate tool
86:02 - that's the old now that my friends the
86:05 - ultimate tool guys
86:06 - give us some fire for our brain guys in
86:08 - the comments below guys
86:09 - are pretty our brains are pretty damn
86:12 - good it's the tool of tools
86:14 - it's the tool that creates all tools
86:16 - this is the most powerful tool in the
86:18 - world right there
86:21 - exactly exactly so nas we went over a
86:24 - lot of different tools a lot of
86:26 - different things
86:27 - what do you think are the things that
86:28 - stick out the most for you so what are
86:30 - what is the things that you use the most
86:31 - yourself
86:32 - you know because i know we had a huge
86:33 - list there you guys can go back check
86:35 - them out
86:36 - there's tools for everything you know
86:38 - regarding communication regarding you
86:40 - know version control regarding
86:42 - you know text editors in general
86:44 - extensions for them
86:45 - we went over even you know design tools
86:48 - even some resources that you can use for
86:49 - your web development
86:51 - and web design projects so what are kind
86:54 - of the tools that just
86:55 - stuck out to you the most that you
86:57 - actually use the most not
86:58 - so i think for me the most tools that i
87:00 - i like
87:01 - um that i think the most useful is
87:05 - so we talk about communication tools um
87:07 - and as you guys know communication is
87:10 - is is so vital in development or just in
87:13 - any job in general
87:15 - and so for example tools like slack
87:18 - tools like trello
87:19 - tools like asana they make us better
87:21 - than make us
87:22 - efficient like literally guys i'm not
87:25 - kidding
87:25 - this team would not be where it is right
87:27 - now without slack
87:30 - do you agree with me completely
87:33 - like without slack and i remember you
87:35 - brought it you brought it into the
87:36 - conversation i don't know i don't know
87:38 - who brought it i i don't know who
87:39 - brought it maybe i did maybe i didn't i
87:41 - don't know
87:41 - all right you're being humble that's
87:42 - cool that's cool now is humble give it
87:44 - up for nas hey who's pumped
87:46 - put it in the comments below who's
87:47 - pumped
87:51 - but i think the most important guy i
87:52 - think guys is like right
87:54 - those specific tools are very important
87:55 - so you know for any project
87:57 - and when i worked on university projects
87:59 - when i worked on you know
88:01 - at a company slack was extremely
88:02 - important for me you know
88:04 - trello was extremely important for me
88:06 - that was the basic things the most space
88:09 - then the next most important tool you
88:11 - know is obviously git
88:13 - that is one is like it's like right
88:16 - there
88:16 - you you cannot go wrong with it you have
88:18 - to learn it because you're gonna be
88:19 - using that as a developer all the time
88:21 - okay um and then
88:24 - and then what i would highly recommend
88:26 - as well is once you've kind of
88:28 - gotten those some other tools are really
88:30 - nice are of course
88:31 - are going to be like loom like dropper
88:35 - and some really like like droplets again
88:38 - to again to communicate
88:40 - so i just mentioned a lot of
88:42 - communication tools so
88:44 - yeah i would also say that is my
88:47 - end-all be-all communication tools
88:51 - yep so communication tools are gonna
88:53 - really you know facilitate the way that
88:54 - you
88:55 - share with others your experience your
88:57 - code your whatever project that you're
88:59 - working in
88:59 - i agree with you man slack to me is one
89:02 - of the most important ones that we've
89:03 - used up until this point just because
89:05 - it's been so easy to communicate with
89:06 - the team
89:07 - to file share to you know write notes
89:09 - for myself whenever i'm working on a
89:10 - project i use slack
89:12 - so that's to me it's one of the most
89:14 - important ones i have to say man
89:15 - for me i love going back to you know
89:18 - optimizing my workflow
89:19 - using alfred four and yoink wow that
89:22 - really changed my whole life like not
89:24 - only my
89:24 - work life but literally my whole life
89:26 - and i was like how
89:28 - you know how did i live without these
89:30 - tools alfred specifically
89:32 - and then yoink you know touching on them
89:34 - a little bit again
89:35 - so this one is the clipboard and the
89:37 - search bar
89:38 - instead of using the native mac search
89:41 - bar i use alfred and it's
89:42 - way way better guys so you know do
89:44 - invest a little bit into these tools i
89:46 - think they're gonna change your life and
89:48 - actually
89:49 - save you guys a lot of time those are a
89:51 - few of the tools that i use the most
89:53 - another one for me that is huge is going
89:55 - to be you know things like dribble
89:57 - and things like you know envato all of
90:00 - these things like pinterest that give
90:01 - you a lot of ideas onto
90:03 - how to work you know how to see other
90:06 - people's projects and make them your own
90:08 - what to integrate what not to what looks
90:10 - good what doesn't look good
90:12 - what type of trends are going on in
90:13 - europe what type of trends are going on
90:15 - in web design you know whether that's
90:17 - last year this year we can compare them
90:20 - and that's going to give you a lot of
90:21 - reference experience onto how to
90:23 - actually
90:24 - you know build stuff what i've found the
90:26 - most in my design
90:27 - is the fact that design is all about
90:29 - style
90:31 - so you know whenever you try to whenever
90:34 - you copy a style that somebody else has
90:36 - then it's like you all of a sudden like
90:40 - you don't know anything but you copy
90:41 - somebody else's style that has
90:43 - been doing web development or web design
90:44 - for a long time then you look like a pro
90:47 - you know because these guys have
90:48 - actually done the work for a few years
90:50 - they have refined a few skills that you
90:52 - haven't picked up yet
90:53 - so by modeling other people's designs
90:55 - that's how
90:56 - you're gonna get a good style and your
90:58 - style dictates whether that design is
91:01 - good or not
91:02 - and obviously the style and the user
91:04 - experience like we mentioned are the
91:05 - huge things for that yeah exactly
91:08 - exactly
91:09 - um yeah those tools yeah
91:12 - just guys i i think when i found out
91:15 - about alfred it was very helpful for me
91:16 - i was like holy moly no way
91:19 - um and i think yoink uh really improved
91:21 - my workflow as well
91:23 - um i i want to give a shout out really

92:06 - want to answer
92:07 - drop them right now in the comments
92:08 - nasa's gonna answer a few here's one
92:10 - that i think might be you know important
92:12 - for a few people to understand
92:13 - because i've seen it a lot of times
92:15 - being popped up so armand
92:17 - lohan asks is learning react beginner
92:20 - friendly
92:21 - no what would you say to this uh yes yes
92:24 - yes i mean i mean i would say
92:26 - for example start out with javascript
92:27 - just kind of learn some basics of
92:29 - javascript
92:30 - um because there's a good learning curve
92:31 - to react um so
92:33 - learn some basic javascript which by the
92:35 - way you can learn from you know profit
92:36 - joseph course
92:37 - link in description um
92:41 - so learn some basics javascript some
92:42 - basics of html css and then dive
92:44 - straight into react
92:46 - and you're going to be golden from there
92:50 - yep yep so danielle
92:54 - does bring another one that's i think
92:56 - important
92:57 - he asks i agree but when you go to
93:00 - freelancing sites such as fiverr upwork
93:02 - you notice that
93:03 - good percentage of the web developers
93:05 - jobs there are wordpress based so more
93:08 - people need
93:08 - wordpress so wordpress is
93:12 - actually huge i know that it all i think
93:15 - it's like 70
93:16 - of the web uses wordpress something
93:18 - insane like that probably
93:19 - yeah more than 60 for sure so
93:22 - i know that right now web development is
93:24 - is super in it's super hip
93:26 - everybody's trying to learn it and
93:27 - everything wordpress has been along
93:30 - around for a long long time do you have
93:31 - any experience with wordpress in general
93:33 - on us
93:33 - oh yeah when i guys when i first started
93:35 - freelancing guys i've been i was
93:37 - building wordpress sites left and right
93:39 - um yeah wordpress is a big one and it's
93:42 - a great one for for example let's say
93:44 - you are doing freelancing wordpress is a
93:47 - great one to start out with
93:48 - and mainly because i mean there's just
93:50 - so many jobs out there for wordpress and
93:53 - so many you know companies who want to
93:55 - create
93:56 - um sites and so many co and so many you
93:59 - know different people who want to use
94:00 - wordpress for other different tools
94:02 - um but yeah no uh
94:05 - learn it as well and you know especially
94:08 - for freelancing
94:09 - very useful and it's it's it's a great
94:12 - technology and it will never go away
94:14 - i know huge huge companies use wordpress
94:17 - i know tim ferriss uses wordpress
94:19 - he actually even you know i think he's

Cleaned transcript:

we're gonna talk about the top tools for devs guys what is up guys hope you guys are doing amazing today we're gonna cover some amazing tools and not just your typical tools we're gonna cover some tools that are gonna make you more effective in terms of learning in terms of being a developer guys awesome i see that there might be a little bit of an audio problem here let me see i think we're all good i think we're good so let's continue on so guys guys who is pumped to get this started guys let's go ahead and get into the meat of the bones of everything that we're gonna cover today let's go frankie one second let me see yup yup yup yup i think they can hear us well yeah it seems like there's an audio problem on that other screen so and system audio moved it obviously you need to be successful it's all good let's get it going come on let's go frankie we got this there we go so this is the top tools for developers and we're going to speak about all of these things we're going to go into details with this and so drop me drop in the comments below guys if you guys can hear us all right if you guys can see everything that is going on yes they can hear us all well we just need to get started frankie let's get this party started hell yeah give me one sec ready ready ready let's go so guys actually guys yes why tools why tools i don't know so why to why tools guys why do you guys think we need tools in general as developers that's a question from from me to you okay so um the way i see it personally and let me know kind of what how you see it frankie the way i see it personally is tools make us more efficient tools make us faster and tools a lot give us a much faster learning curve so you can just skyrocket to the moon infinity and beyond am i right am i right yes indeed yeah at the end of the day you don't want to be you know patrick star and have you know being having the nail on your forehead not knowing how to use a hammer and everything so tools are not gonna change your whole game if you don't put in the work you know like nasa's been saying at the end of the day it's just to get better at everything that you do and also become more efficient on your workplace because you know you can take five hours doing a specific task but if you have the right tools it might only take you about one minute or two yes exactly exactly by the way i just want to say welcome to everybody here we got ha ha because we got harped you guys are amazing hundred thanks so much says whoa whoa nas and frankie so awesome to see you guys in the comments thank you guys for being here awesome thank you all for being here all right let's get this party started frankie let's get this party started hey hey let's get this party started so nice take it over let's see what's the next step for us uh next what next step all right so first things first we're going to talk about these text editors okay um so what are the top text editors that we're going to we're going to talk about today frankie yokaze come frankie what did you say what are the top tech senators we're going to talk about today so the top ones for us at least it's going to be bs code it's going to be intellij it's going to be eclipse and swift so the thing about this is that you know depending on the type of development that you're doing you're going to use either an ide or a text editor so if you're doing something you know like javascript or even python you can use things like vs code which are a little bit more lightweight you know they're not as robust as big ides like you know eclipse intellij even netbeans which is freaking insanely heavy to run on your system but you know whatever language you're using whatever type of tool you're creating is the type of id that you'll be using so if you're trying to do ios apps you have to use xcode yes yes yes so like like because kind of how frankie said right you know vs code is our top our top one that we like to we like to like to use if you guys are using java for example then you're going to use for example eclipse which is the one that's kind of in the middle um and xcode if you're going to use for example like um if you're going to use you know swift or you know programming for and building ios apps or building apps for mac right so you're going to use those specific ones by the way i just want to say thank you okay guys visual vishal shah really appreciate your donation you're 20 i'm not i never know what this is 20 euros no 20 something 20 some money i never know what money it is but yeah michelle really appreciate it amanda how's it going how's it going thanks so much amanda um to for being in the chat always being so supportive um sayudi is like super chat within three minutes let's go say yuri sweet sweet sweet but yeah canada kind of how you know uh frankie talked about guys um eclipse and intellij is going to be great for when you're doing like a lot more higher higher level um more complicated programming for example maybe you're building using c sharp or maybe for example you are you could you are using um i don't know java or c plus plus right you're gonna be using those specific ones but but for your basic ones you know vs code is gonna be the one for you um honestly but yeah guys so yeah as we're kind of just going through some stuff just want to say welcome again welcome again we got vivid elite says hey i got a question i dabbed in a little bit of java and web development when i was 12 and have been flying through this swapped out class i've been doing i should explain that as a previous experience sweet that's awesome that's awesome that is great how should i explain that i already had a preview experience so tell us why you like us code that much man why i like this code so vs code is just amazing because it's lightweight it's fast it has a ton of extensions right a ton of extensions and it's just used by so many developers at this point um that that it's nuts yeah yeah it's crazy there's a huge community around bs code it's kind of like a cult to be on friday i can't be honest so a lot of people use vs code it's it's a huge community also you know javascript is greatly used to vs code so the community in javascript is huge you know you're trying to jump into other languages like flutter and all of these you know those newer languages don't have communities as big as these so you can ask you know all the detailed questions that you'd like you can get all these those different answers and everything so you know it all adds up to that now we're gonna go to our next slide which is so these are gonna be the text editors for web developers right so these are the top ones you know even node plus plus is there which you know a lot of people that are not even developers use note note plus plus um notepad plus plus and at the end of the day i used to use it to just use you know get notes here and there also sublime text is one of the biggest ones as well people love it or hate it because it always you know it always pops up a window that tells you to pay for the program so yeah that's kind of a funny thing there as well yeah yeah yeah but i would say with internet starters guys very important very important uh just pick one you know and go with the guys don't don't try to you know don't try to think so much about okay yeah at the end of the day i feel like people do spend a lot of time trying to get the perfect ide or text editor but you know it's all about having a specific environment where you feel comfortable in you know working with your code and a lot of times if it's slow and everything it's just going to hold you back so make sure that you make the right choice with that sweet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay like you said already a little bit yeah yeah the bs code okay guys if you use your best that is what you like the most so right here we're putting also some vs code extensions just because of the fact that this code is really good on its own you really don't need anything mouse was actually going a little bit deep into this that sometimes people don't even know you know that much coding but they try to entertain themselves by downloading a bunch of different extensions and thing is you know you can get distracted with that but these extensions such as prettier and then liveshare and then bracket colorizer i feel are very productive in the sense that you know prettier makes your code indent and actually refactor the right the correct way so it's easier to to see it to play with it and to work with others other people's code as well so liveshare is also the actual extension that we use here in our all of our clone builds you know sonny and kazi are always you doing pair programming it's a awesome tool to start you know working with other people on your team and then inviting people to edit your code can you tell us a little bit more about bracket regularizing us yeah i think yeah in terms of bracket colorizer um you know a lot of times guys you know you would have you know you have a long piece of code right and you have kind of called the triangle you guys know what the triangle of death is basically it's just like you have an if statement or a force or a function but within another function and it just kind of creates a lot of brackets right and so what happens is let me know if you agree with me on this one what happens is you actually can't you don't know specifically what bracket contributes to what other brackets okay right so when we do it so we do something like a polarizer that will tell you specifically hey this bracket is specifically with this right this bracket specifically with this bracket and so forth and it keeps going and keeps going so highly recommend you get you guys get that one very very very very useful keep it on the screen awesome so another addition to the tools that we use here on the team specifically is going to be these three so rocket is amazing you know if you do want to humanize your text a little bit more then i think you know adding emojis to everything just adds a little bit of spice so whether that's in any title that you're doing just conversations with people on your team trying to you know pull out a report on you know stats or the code that you're working in you know you can make it always look pretty with rockets so alfred is actually one of my favorite ones i can't believe i was living my life without using this specifically and i'm just going to show you guys really quick how to use it so i got it here on screen and so one of the biggest things that i like about alfred is the fact that you can find specific files so let's find clever programmer logo okay so there's not that one right but everything that it's actually right here so clear programmer lower you can find any file that you're looking for specifically and then the cool thing about this is that it also has a clipboard that you can you know save things for about 90 days so if you're trying to save a chunk of code a snippet of code or something like that then you can just reuse it and then paste it so that's specifically what what alfred does and let me go back the last one would be yoink yoink is awesome as well if you're a developer because you know as developers you're always moving things around whether that's on your desktop moving files and everything so one of the hideous and most you know frustrating things for me is moving files around different screens you know if you have your google chrome open or if you have multiple screens sometimes instead of dragging something all the way to the side so give me one second i can't give you a presentation of viewing right now but it's supposed to be a little clipboard that's attached to the side of your screen and you can just pull the file and then put it next to the screen so i feel like it's very useful i showed it to sunny sunny loved it he's like bro i don't know exactly how was how i was being a developer without this what do you think about these tools yeah so i i love i remember when i realized what like rocket or alfred or yoink was i was like holy but yeah amazing amazing amazing tools guys highly recommend them um yeah just get them take a look at them give them a try and then continue on awesome so now we're going to go to the next point which is communication we think communication tools are super important if you're a developer just because of the fact that you're always working with other people and this is just a funny meme right here you know it says what is this communication word you speak of all right so like we said communication is vital these are some of the actual programs that we use the software that we use and right now our company actually uses slack we used to have you know all of our conversations on whether that's imessages just facebook messenger or we actually use basecamp a lot too but we ended up sticking with actual you know slack because slack is is very very efficient in terms of file sharing just the actual chat and everything but before that we were actually using basecamp now a lot of things in communication do differ a little bit let's say like right here we listed trello just because you know if you are working with clients or you're having projects or trying to project manage you know whatever you're doing with your code working with more people trello is actually a very good way to do this so you know you can use kanban style boards and then give a little bit of details of all the code that you're writing there and then actually assign people to you know either edit your code add things to it or think to the sort and asana is a very very similar tool like trello just like trello we use this too and specifically i feel like these two are great for client client and you know project relationships and communication what do you think about business yeah so i'm a big of asana and i think we have i mean 40 amount of money really appreciate that but yeah great tools guys you know to consider if you're gonna use if you're gonna pick one if you're going to pick one for teams let's say you're working on a project for example i'd highly recommend you for example use slack so bro i know that you were working a lot in freelancing so what type of tools would you use in freelancing yourself yeah so in freelancing 100 slack for a team okay and then and then 100 also um kind of you know about a year ago and that's when i kind of came in and started working with you guys and i also introduced travel um but trello and another one that i would also use as well it's not on here but it's called jira something to take a look at it's like think of it as like a more professional version of trouble nice how do you spell that jira jiira so zero yeah okay awesome so communication is awesome guys please you know try to develop your communication skills the more that the more better that you get in communication it's going to be easier for you to just go into you know more more actual managerial roles actually you know trying to lead a team and then taking the best out of people so that you can you guys can work together so this is going to lead me to my next light and we already touched a little bit on it and it's working remotely essential so nas felt like it was very important to add these two aspects of the software that we use and can you explain a little bit about this oh he you can hear me now there you go now sorry my bad my bad my bad but awesome that was what i was saying is like loom is a great one if you are you know working remotely working at home working at home and you need to go ahead and share some knowledge you need to go ahead and communicate with another teammate right um simply record what it really does what makes it so easy is the fact that you can simply click record really fast okay it will record your voice it will record what you're trying to what point you're trying to get through and then it will right away actually upload it to the internet automatically you can copy the link and then send it to your coworker so if you are working from home you know just kind of get it play around with it right you can you know you can basically record it on the fly and it just makes things so much so much easier guys you know loom can be used in so many different ways like now said whether you're sharing code with people even if you want to go into interviews one time we had this guy who actually wanted to work with clever programmer and he sent qazi a loom video explaining kind of you know his skills and everything i think he was uh he was a marketer he was doing facebook ads or something similar so he went over his profile and kind of just talked a little bit more about his skills because he was amazed he was like wow this guy is insane i want to hire him you know so yeah even for interviews and things like that loom can be very very powerful kind of as you know as a form of like hey check me out can i get a job at the company dude and guess what what happened he got the job at the company wow yeah thank goodness yeah dude insane insane insane stuff that's awesome man i'm super happy to hear that by the way thank you so much for 20 rupees yeah again i really appreciate it man thank you robin appreciate you man so then the second work essential that we think is super important for people to get good at is going to be droplet so droplet i did not know about this until i met qazi and i became a killer in just showing people what i'm exactly working on what i need help with and stuff because you're able to take screenshots really easily and you can actually so you can take let's say a screenshot of this and then point out like okay i need help here and then you can just share it it's gonna give you a little link so the image is gonna be uploaded to the internet automatically and then after that you're gonna get a link that you can share with anybody and everybody anybody that has that that link can access that image so it's really fast it's actually faster than the actual native program that is a mac i feel like that one is too robust and kind of slow so dropper is a great way to share your ideas i use it a lot to share reports such as ads and everything of the sort what do you think about dropper man i love dropper and when i found out that we could use it oh man i got so happy it just makes things so much easier like if you you know really quickly if you want to screenshot an idea or you want to screenshot something you saw online um screenshot it quick annotation add some text to it make a or two and be like yo check this out you know or check this out check this out check this out put as many arrows you can put as many arrows as you want and it's just so quick so quick and then upload automatically so yeah exactly it's a beautiful beautiful software that you should become good at it's free i think there's a pro version and i believe it's like five dollars a month so it's totally worth it go into that so now this leads us to our next point which is time management time management is super duper important i feel like you know i talk about this all the time but really time is the most important asset that you know we as humans have just because of the fact that you know other assets such as money are always replenishable you can always get more money you can always build more skill to get more money or do something else that'll bring you money but what we cannot do is there's literally nothing in life that is going to give you more time you know everybody in the whole world has only 24 hours a day to do whatever they want to carry out in that day and so the difference the difference that you can do yourself is actually learn how to manage your 24 hours in a more productive way so we're going to go deeper into that let's do it man awesome so a little bit of time management here you have to set time sprints for yourself so let's say you're working on code you're working on a project i feel like i myself work way way better once i kind of have you know a certain plan of attack right so let's say i'm i'm gonna code for 30 minutes and then rest for 10 or 5. i feel like that's super vital for me just because you know i want to do this for the long term and i want to actually have very good clarity while i'm working on things because sometimes we're working on things so much so extensively that we get so deep into either the code or whatever thing that you're working on and sometimes you just kind of have to have to take a step back and from there you can reassess you know what needs to be done so one of the cool things about time management that i use a lot is kind of just what i mentioned right now is the pomodoro technique so pomodoro is very very important for me the way that i use it is i do 25 minutes and then i rest for five i do this while i'm editing videos you know a lot of the videos that you guys see here are edited by me or either alex or aaron as well so that's super helpful for me especially if i'm doing something creative and then you want to talk about the last point now yeah the last point which is you know uh kind of getting rid of like stress and anxiety um i know that all of us you know here have stress we have anxiety right we have work which gives us you know stress and things like that or other external things which give us stress and so for me it's just especially for me it's extremely important to kind of be able to uh balance myself okay because if you're always stressed out if you're always kind of an anxiety state um that's not a good way to live like am i right you don't want to live like that um so you need to have tools right you need to have tools to kind of bring that down and to be able to kind of balance you out you know in general so meditation is one way to do that right meditation you go sit down 20 minutes meditate relax you know focus on one thing and that is it that's one thing another thing you can do for example another thing you can do for example i personally for me that works as i go for a run like i go ahead i go for a really quick run you know 10 20 minutes i come back take a shower i am all good and i'm so ready like i'm ready to take on the damn world seriously right and then with the run and then you know sometimes again uh and sometimes i'll do yoga so yoga helps me out as well but before we continue on i just want to show this really quick guys guys check this out you see this clock check out this clock right here this is in terms of time management for example let's say you're doing your things in like minutes right this clock for example you say hey i'm about to i will go ahead and i will do work for 30 minutes you said 30 minutes and it will tick to zero and then when it ticks to zero it will go ahead and beep an alarm and that is time for you to get up and start moving wow that's really really useful man right there see and just kind of move however however many minutes you want to kind of do so it's a really cool clock check this out guys just call it thing it's called like a time timer i think that's what it's called i actually love that it's a physical thing you know because yeah i've been so used to just using you know productivity apps so much that sometimes i kind of crave something that i can touch so that makes it a little bit more real for me i really appreciate that i love it so yeah you know going a little bit back into the whole time management thing it's a huge thing that a lot of us you know do end up kind of ignoring the psychological aspects of time management and stress relief all of these things and so like i said before you know pomodoro technique is super useful it's greatly used in a lot of different companies and just you know workplaces so one of the things that can help you actually with meditation if you are starting out it would be the headspace app so this app is really gold guys i love this app it's one of the best that i've ever used it's so minimalistic i love the design of it the branding of it too it just makes me feel so clean but you know other than that it's it's great if you do either want to have you know a guided meditation if you want to just have some mindfulness meditation you know different types of meditation what i do a lot is um when i'm working on a project whether that's a video or code itself i feel like you know trying to do visualization during meditation actually helps a lot in software especially if you're doing things like wireframing which we're going to touch in our other slides as well we're going to go a little bit deeper into that now what i'm going to talk about is actually what not talked about a little bit so you know meditation is that stress relief one of those would be running and i use running a lot too because like i said before guys you know if you are too engulfed in the thing that you're doing your attention just becomes a little bit closed down you know you're the way you're the way that you start thinking becomes very limited you are kind of not surrounded by different contexts and stuff so what helps out a lot is really going for a run you know you cannot ignore these psychological aspects of coding and working so that's going to be a huge one for you guys now the next thing that we want to touch we think it's a huge huge huge tool that every developer should use is command line guys as you guys know right command line that is it's the basics it is is as developers and what we use every single day right and the thing is like here's the thing guys let's listen up really closely here this is not some magic this is not some magic you know this is not some like highlevel advanced stuff this is actually pretty basic okay and there is the reason why it's pretty basic and we wrote down some basic things on the lefthand side which you can see right there so if you can go ahead uh circle the the things the left hand side right the command line is what kind of allows you to no no no no no not there there we go there we go so circle this like for example there right it is what allows you to for example to create directors it will allow you for example to view files and guys the main things the main things you need to know are the ones we have just went ahead and showed you right there that is it that is pretty much it guys cd change directory ls view of files cd uh dot dot slash go up a directory mkd a machine is make a directory vam right vm also very popular and then rm to remove files with those that's pretty much need to know right there's some other ones that are more advanced but that's it just know those and you're golden guys that's it exactly and once you know how to use these then you can just literally look up on google look for command line commands sheet and once you have that you're golden you're all set because i remember when i was picking up command line you know i was learning unix when i learned how to change directories and how to move files around directories or just rename them on a bulk or you know all of these different type of commands i felt like a hacker man i don't know about you but i felt like mr robot or something i loved it so you know frankie is a hacker you know frankie he's a hacker yeah so people you know think that you have to be super advanced to learn unix and bash scripting and all of these things but in reality it's it's very you know straightforward you know just look at a small tutorial and if you do you're going to be able to move around things really really fast so this does take me to my next point which i want to touch on which is going to be git so all developers really really need to know git or version or version control really so i know nas you've been working on a lot of startups you've also worked with a lot of different freelancers and stuff so what's your experience with git yeah i mean you there's there's not there's no way around it guys you have to learn you have to know how to use it okay it is called version control it is what kind of keeps your code in check and is what allows you to work with teams okay very important right so for example think of it as like you have your code think of it as like your code is you know is saved and you have every single change that you make to your code is recorded as well and so that way you know let's say you screw up which you will which was most likely you will i do all the time you'll scroll you're gonna screw up and then what's gonna happen is you wanna go back to revert your screw up right and so git allows you to do that kind of stuff and it allows you to see what other things you have done so again git um learn it you know know it use it and you you'll see it kind of as we go through this stuff guys it's it's so extremely easy like frankie let's go ahead and go to the next one go to next slide next slide next slide okay not that one okay that's fine okay yeah so yep go ahead these are just you know part of the command line so unix is the language of you know command line it's been used since the 1970s it's crazy that it's now still used windows uses unix for its command line that was actually very recent i think it happened about two to three years ago that they decided to change to unix but max command line does use unix and dash is really the language that is used by unix to do the scripting and all of these things so now we do want to touch on wireframing because wireframing is going to be an important asset an important particular process that you use for your web development and any type of development really was one of the first introductions that i have to wireframing so how do you use wireframing yourself man yeah so tell me guys what do you guys think average actually think what do you think wireframe is in the comments okay um but i'm gonna tell you right now so wireframe is simply just imagine you have an idea okay let's let's imagine this okay you got an idea for a startup okay you want to build facebook the next facebook okay you're building the next facebook okay it's great but hold on i have i have this thing that's in my mind how do i put it into something that i can see and so that my friends is where wireframing comes in you can see for example we have an app i know on on there okay and this app right we have simply for example we have the login page we have another different page and it's very basic okay doesn't have any images it's not colorful it's nothing but it does portray the idea of what the app is am i correct or not i am correct because i know this so so it portrays the idea of what it is think of it as like it's kind of like a an outline of what your app looks like so this is the first thing that you're gonna do when you first start out to build applications guys you know and this is something that we very highly teach also in our profit with javascript course which by the way link is in bio but um something we very highly teach and a lot of our students will come back to me and be like whoa thanks so much i finally understand how to co how to take an idea i have in my mind process it draw it out and actually execute on it to then see a result and so that it's why it's such an important part uh just you know learn it um try do a few different wireframes and you're gonna see just how easy it is yeah i think wireframing is really essential um for different reasons one of the reasons i think is because you're actually making your code practical and visual and so sometimes you know you're just coding around a project that you're thinking but you can never really visualize it so it ends up looking like crap or the user experience of the actual app or whatever or actually you know would the button look better in the middle or under you know so all of these things are things that you can work in on your wireframe and there's a few tools that we want to talk about in wireframing and so now we're going to jump into these can you talk a little bit about them you know i think you're here here are some of the tools guys that you want to use okay now the first tool and i'm going to start with the one at the bottom um it's going to be dryo right this it's it's the one that's free and it allows you to just kind of create wireframes very very easily okay it's free just check it out uh go on paid version go into paid version you have sketch which is the one on the left hand side and it has the kind of orange little icon okay um and then you have figma on the right hand side that one is a little that partially free thing about one and then you have envision which envision on the right hand side which is the one that has like the that red circle the red square that one what do you guys think that is that one is what actually allows you to upload your wireframe or your mockup we call it upload your mockup to online and share it with your client so if you guys have a client for example okay let's say you got a client you go ahead and simply just put that you know put your mockup on envision and boom voila you're golden and then your clients can actually see your mockup comment on it and so forth so great tools um check all them out i highly recommend if you're going to start with wireframing just do draw your use draw yo and you will be you'll be fine with that yeah style be it frank you have something to say in that so okay i can't hear your frankie so i know that figma right now is a very very popular tool for wireframing and the reason why figma is so great is not only because it's very easy to use a lot of web developers and web designers are using it right now the fact that whatever you do end up designing in figma then you can just actually get the css and html code from actual figma on how you you know prototyped it then you can just paste it into your actual code so it's really efficient in you know coding in general because not only do you end up building something visually you can actually use it very practically with code so figma which is this icon right here is a great great tool for wireframing it's one of our most used ones for for sure so draw io it's also very important i even use draw io for other type of projects i use it to whenever i'm doing ad campaigns or things of the sort for the business you know i use draw io so that i can manage how my campaigns are looking you know if i'm trying to run it to you know either warm audiences or people that don't know us anything of like anything of the sort i just kind of map it out and draw io is actually a thing that helps me hugely so you guys can start using it and you can get creative in the way that you use it yeah and then one other thing i want to mention you guys really quickly here is is actually somebody mentioned i think let me see who oh devon gray he mentioned adobe xd we forgot to put on there adobe xd guys it's free and it's also like sketch or sigma so yeah check that out adobe isd uh easy to use free but also great awesome yeah yeah adobe street is super powerful so they always come up with good software and everything adobe's adobe envision is great like not said now i'm going to lead into our other thing that our other tool that i feel is going to be very important for all developers when i learned it i was like whoa what what was i doing i was i was coding everything from scratch it's not the most ideal thing to do so now we want to touch on what i don't get that frankie i don't i don't get this i don't know it's funny man come on i didn't like this gift but dude it's libraries and frameworks and then you can see bella here bill is super happy to use libraries as you can see nas is not apparently but you know bella is having the time of her life just you know moving around the library so who's with me on this one you guys you guys get this because i don't get i'm sorry i love it man so you know going deeper into libraries whenever when i discovered libraries or frameworks you know i was starting out with javascript and then i was trying to build a website that can that actually in the beginning of the website it had a it was a an actual what are they called slide shows they're called so for a moment in time websites had a lot of slide shows in the beginning like the front the big portion of it and i was like wow i wanted to sign a website that looks like that and so i was like how am i going to code up a slideshow i was i was very much a beginner at that point i still kind of am and so you know i was like okay i don't want to i don't want to do this from scratch what do i do then i discovered jquery which is a framework for javascript and what that allowed me to do was to go into the jquery library and check out some code that other people had written so that i can reuse their code for a slideshow and that's exactly what i did and man i ended up loving it i never went back and i really couldn't believe the fact that i didn't know about this and i was writing all my code from scratch what's your experience with this yeah i would say guys guys i mean i actually really funny enough guys i started coding and like making websites you know with the dreamweaver dreamweaver okay now if you guys don't know what that is let's just say it's not good and you should not be using it okay but this is basically you're gonna write vanilla javascript vanilla html all that stuff right you're gonna use and you're not going to reuse code at all and so i was literally copying pasting like every single page like every single page copy and pasting for every new page that's it's not something you want to do okay so when you guys for example let's say you learned some javascript when you guys have gone into learning vanilla javascript okay when you got into learning you know html css you kind of know all those the foundation which you kind of need to know okay once you've you kind of learned that then it's time for you to get into for example like react or like angular or start to use for example like jquery okay then you want to move into those specific frameworks because that my friends is when you start to build humongous and scalable applications okay javascript javascript and all that is still a foundation but that is where you start to build yep yes exactly so like uh kind of how kind of how um kind of how frankie here is showing us here so we have best javascript frameworks and libraries and tools um you know jquery on the left hand side jquery kind of came along a long time ago then we have react they came along they have angularjs that came along and and so forth now what i would recommend is you know your next question might be is like what's on like what do you think they're going to ask and ask next what's the best framework to start with exactly what is the best phone to start with so guys what is the best camera to start with there a best framework i don't know i don't think so but what we recommend is what what do we recommend frankie at the end of the day man it's really what you want to use that framework for so you know if you are trying to you know go front end and you know build a website anything like that i think react would be a good framework to start with you know sonny and kazzy have been making really really crazy builds with react recently you know if you do want to work a little bit more on back end then you would use node so all of these are a little bit similar but a little bit different it does depend a lot on what you're trying to do with them so you know that really in essence is going to dictate what type of framework or library you're going to end up using so like nas said at the end of the day stick to one you know try to master you know if you do end up going into a bunch of them and you go to react very deeply into angular really deeply and then you know really deeply then at the end of the day you might not pick up anything right so try to specialize on one at least yeah start with one pick one guys i guess so many questions like hey you know what's the best one is angular is it react you know is it moon you know you know you know i don't know i don't know uh but pick one you know pick react for example and then just go with it definitely definitely so now this takes us to our next point and another great great great developer tool kit that people can use is going to be chrome extensions yeah oh yeah guys i love this gift guys i mean guys i mean you agree with me gif you agree with me on this gift i know i know if you agree with me let me know in the comments below i know you agree with me but so chrono sanchez here those are the top ones that i personally use and you know we personally use and i like and definitely something that for you to check out so so number one number one is momentum do you know momentum is frankie yeah man i love it it's super motivational i just opened chrome and it's like hey you are the best in the world i'm like yes yeah frankie you are the best in the world frankie thank you guys guys put in the comments below frankie's the best in the world put in the comments below come on let's do it get some motivational speeches out here but can you actually show to them can you actually show them like an example yeah let me see i think actually has it here in his computer so let's pop it up so every time that you open up can you guys see this yes so every time you open up a new tab on chrome then you can see the time and then you can see you know quote be patient since this is computer this is what it says for him and then right here you can either type you know what it asks you what is your main focus for today so today i'm going to put live stream you know you can do a little to do note right there it also gives you the let me see i'm going to pull up my brush here so it also gives you the weather and then the city that you're in as well as a motivational code on the bottom as well so right here you can also do to do's as well why do you like momento so much momentum yeah i guess interestingly enough but seriously frankie i discovered it like not too long ago not too long ago literally like probably like two weeks ago but there's just it's clean it's so nice it just makes you feel warm you know it makes it feel like it's cozy nice yeah yeah yeah you know you go into your chrome and it's like it's all white or you just see the google logo it kind of doesn't just because you know you can see good landscapes it motivates you it tells you the time makes you aware of where you're at right now so i feel like it's yeah it's very soothing exactly okay so what is what is this weaponizer because i know that you added this because you really what what okay never mind you really love this yeah guys is a very useful for example um let's say you want to know like what technologies a specific site is using okay so opalizer if you actually so you can probably open chrome can you open up wobblizer chrome extension yeah just search up wapolize or chrome extension and you get you'll see what i mean but mobilizer yeah chrome extension yeah there we go yeah that's the one here so yeah so if you scroll down you see that the screenshot right there right so this shows no no not there the screenshot right there so just no not the screenshot frankie that's the screenshot that so you're using the screenshot okay now screenshot i'm not bad um so here you can see what it does is it shows you all the technologies that a specific website is using so for example let's go let's say you go on youtube okay and then youtube you want to see okay what technologies is this i using is it using shopify is it using wordpress um is it using react is it using angular right and so what this will do what vapolizer will do is it will tell you what technology is using and now remember specifically like back back in the day when i first kind of you know figuring everything out i used to look at okay what technologies is this side using yeah i was kind of doing my research you know kind of like haha these guys are using this okay then maybe i should learn this you know so like that's yeah that's very common actually among web developers and stuff this this actually does remind me of another tool that i use a lot that you actually reminded me of this so let's check it out it's called built with technologies if you go here and then let's say you go and put cleverprogrammer.com it's going to tell you all the tech stuff that is being used here all the extensions that are being used and everything so look at that you can see the deadline funnel you can see use proof funnelling google analytics even tells you the pixels guys so you know it even tells you the fonts you know you can see here google fonts give me one second right here google fonts cookie bar money manychat all of these things so these are great tools for when you're web developing and or you want to you're curious about what a you know website is built out of these are great great tools to figure that thing out yeah yeah so now i'm going to talk a little bit more about one tool that i really like so fonts ninja is an awesome awesome tool that i love for designing one of the ways that i use it is you know i actually heard about this i was in an extension what was it a conference in nashville tennessee called funnel hacking live and this web designer girl who has made millions of dollars in cloning websites so she looks at the websites that convert the most that sell the most then she picks them apart and redesigns them and builds websites just like those so exactly so one of the tools that they would use would be fun ninja ninja and then what funds ninja is gonna allow you to do is actually when you scroll over when when you hover over a text you can just highlight it like if you highlight it it's gonna tell you exactly what font is used so you can then go ahead and go to google fonts or something and download it from there and another tool that i added here as well that i actually liked a lot and i actually heard it from that same conference from that same girl who was a master designer is eye color picker so this is another chrome extension that i greatly really love you can just hit the extension and then go to a color that you like on the website and it's going to tell you the hex code a bit so whenever you do want to use that hex code that color specifically then you can just you know grab it from there put it either on photoshop put it on your code or anything related to that yeah so i'm not sure what this one is can you tell me a little bit more about now it looks good i don't know what the text is not on there but guys this my friends this my friends listen closely up here this is solves the chrome ram problem guys give miss give us some fire in the comments down there now here's one here's the one i'm not kidding so here's the one to do i want you to go ahead and in chrome uh search up the great suspender the great suspender yeah the great all right yes there but the top one man i always tell everybody on my team aaron aaron actually on the team man i told you google chrome eats up all year round it is a huge deal yeah a lot of people don't think because it's a web browser and they think it's kind of light nope it eats up all year round yeah so here's a bunch of scroll down take a look go through the images so here's what it does guys check this out you see how it says or click to reload for example so what it does okay what it does is it actually will go ahead and let's say you have like a thousand tabs open not okay let's say you have 20 tabs open that's more more realistic okay let's say you have 20 tabs open what it's going to do is it's going to go ahead and it's going to kill or pause tabs that have been open and not used for a long time so basically tabs who are kind of stale there or just not used it's going to pause the tab it's going to actually screenshot it so they so that when you go back to the tab you can see the the actual um screenshot but it's not actually a site the site is not working just screenshot and so basically you can have basically you can be let's say you're active on one tab let's say you're active in one tab and let's say your 19 tabs are not active it's going to deactivate those tabs until you go back to the tab and then click on it to reload that my friends will fix your ram problem and i use it every single day sonny should download this he was having trouble with his computer last time but yeah so many people having trouble with the chrome ram problem and man that's a great great tool that you just presented to these guys yeah there we go guys guys drop us into some fire in the comments down there because you guys know we're out here bringing you some great stuff you know it it's gonna it's gonna greatly improve your productivity guys so do download all of these chrome extensions what about the react developer tools now yeah so for any of you who who are kind of like um like using react for example just it's just a very easy way for debug i think it's all pretty much i'll say to that but if you're going to be a front developer and if you're gonna use react you need to have react developer tools that's a must not even a question um it's just gonna yeah again debugging is its purpose awesome awesome that's that's beautiful man now you know this all of these different resources i think are very beneficial if anybody has anything to do with you know web development just development in general you know now we're going to touch on a few inspirational tools that we decided to throw in here and this is going to be one of nasa's favorites dribble i put dibble in there it says dibble but it's actually dribble it's actually dribble guys my bad my bad it's actually it's actually dribble um but yeah so dribble it's um so if you guys you know when you guys are building things for example let's you know building a site maybe you're building a portfolio maybe you're building you know anything else maybe you're building an app i'm not sure um you want to kind of go out there and find some inspiration because that is how you actually you know that's how you actually get pointers on what you want to build um and so what i do is i literally go to dribble uh you have to go to dribble through google i don't know it's weird it's like go to go to dribble through google yeah so i go through that so you guys don't have to go through that you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go that's the one so click on that so this is going to be triggered yeah so what this does is you can literally search up let's say you know search up like an app okay you will see some of the best designers you know people who created apps and they put this on here as a way to inspire you i know so you can for example take maybe certain parts and pieces and ideas and kind of implement that into your own application like so for example let's say you build a portfolio site okay um you can literally search a portfolio site and it will give you amazing designs or portfolio sites let's say you're building an app let's say you're building a facebook app type in facebook app and it will give you examples of like i don't mean just generic examples i mean amazing beautifully designed examples right a lot of ideas will literally come from there so i highly recommend you guys check this one out devon grace says dribble with three b's so that was the year trouble with three beasts yeah really really wanted to get that domain yeah yeah yeah yeah plus guys don't dibble dribble that'd be cool dibble sounds fun though yeah yo guys the thing about dribble that is really cool to me it's kind of like the pinterest for developers you know whenever right now we're moving to another house it's going to be a great house we're going to record a lot of videos there but you know one thing that i do a lot is go into pinterest for inspiration whether that's you know interior design just app development in general because actually a lot of apps are on a lot of app design is on pinterest as well so you guys can check that one out as well but it does remind me a lot of dribbble dribble also has a lot of icons so you know if you're trying to look for icons for your app kind of like material ui has like most of the most frameworks do or a lot of mentalities do have their their own icons that you know you don't have to download them because you know everybody hates downloading a png or a logo that has a background there and you can you know actually make it look cool so you know dribble is going to be the place where you can find all of these things yeah yeah then another one that's really really good as well that nas wanted to point so this one sounds funny but it's an amazing one actually it's like let's say you're building let's say like you guys are building hold on let's say you guys are building websites okay let's make let's say maybe you have you have a client or something along the lines along the lines of that um this is going to be a great way for you guys to get inspiration on how a site should look like right so let's say you believe maybe like for example i had a client and the client i was building from the client i was building a um this was a real estate site okay a real estate site and i was trying to get some inspiration on kind of what should i should it look like so what i literally did is i literally went on here and i searched for for um a real estate sites and they give me amazing examples okay so like if you have an example if you want just to see many examples of what other people have done a great again go to lapa that's where you know you have some top 10 top 20 um you know sites on there and you'll be able to see some just beautifully designed examples and you can just you know take some inspiration from here from here from here voila i know from anywhere and that's it let's pull it up so i've never seen lappa it seems like this might be very helpful for a lot of people so let's dive a little bit into it so what do you do you search here something like real estate yeah so let's say for example popular this week for example a new portfolio seo says new portfolios or like let's say you type in ecommerce landing pages you see that ecommerce uh no right there there's a button right there right there right there no it's selected there's a there's like a popular this one i see it i see it here it is ecommerce landing pages nice drop down in the comments below guys if you guys want to see a build of an ecommerce store with kazi or sunny or nas and all of these great developers that we have on our platform drop it down in the comments below let's do it let's do it man so what's up with this yeah so for example here so scroll down keep scrolling i mean look at these amazing so click on so click on one for example let's say click on the plastic is a nogo click on that one i'm gonna look at it just i mean it's so beautifully designed okay um so beautiful design and then you can you can actually go ahead and visit the site so click visit the site so it's not it's not only that it's the design of the website that you're looking at it also shows you the real sites where it's posted yeah sometimes sometimes yes sometimes no it seems like this might be a little bit old or just you know not in service right now so it's actually not loading but i guess a few of them will load yeah some of them below some of them will not but guys like this is i mean look how nice of this design like people really thought about this okay so i literally would go through this and this will give me inspiration how i i want to go ahead and actually build my site just like that yep some of the things that i like about this too that is kind of a lot of people don't know but you know whenever you are looking at designs like this you have to pay attention to the color palettes that they're being used because sometimes designers suck just because they don't know how to work with color and so one of the things that i would tell you if you're a designer go and study color theory man go and study color theory because once you know those basics then you can just play around with everything but if you don't know color theory you're gonna be you know mixing a bunch of tertiary colors that don't look good you're gonna be mixing colors and end up getting brown you're gonna be you know doing weird things with color sometimes what i see when people don't know anything about color theory is that they use very powerful colors like right next to each other so they use something like you know orange and then green and then like really royal blue and all these colors that are so strong but they don't really look good together so yeah one of the biggest hacks that i've seen is you know looking at other people's designs so that i can copy their color palettes because i'm always trying to get better with color and design in general and also i think one important is it it trains your eye like right design is a very subjective thing you know one one person might like it another person might not so you know by by going and looking about some amazing designs you're starting to train your eye and start to train your eye on what something looks you know amazing like what something looks you know the way it should be things like that so um literally you know you gotta do this kind of stuff and you guys building maybe you guys are building a project maybe you guys are building your own portfolio site look at designs see what other people have done and then build it okay i that's i always tell that to all the students so asks color theory is this a thing yes my friend color theory is a thing that a lot of artists actually study so you're starting you know you're starting to go into painting you're starting to go into design anything in the sort color theory it's what it's called so you guys can just google that yeah search up on google search up color palette there's a certain website that i like to use for color palettes color palettes i think it's like yeah go ahead search that up uh first one um no no second one second one colors colors dot co second one colors dot co yeah so even right here guys you can see you know it's crazy let's let's let's look at this so i just googled color palettes and what we can see here is you know the use of the word and the search you know the search term ultimately has been growing the last years so as the design starts to get bigger and more popular people are actually searching the word more you know it seems like in 2003 it was a it was a big you know search it was very popular but now in 2017 and up it's going insane and you know we can even see that a lot of the developments nowadays is going into fun and development and just you know web development in general so in essence you know design became a super vital role in development itself so yeah now let's jump into the actual colors.com yeah so click start the generator start the generator and look at that these are your color palettes so you can you know wow so click click space click space oh wow man and it will it will change color palettes and then you can actually put in your colors too so for example let's say you have another color you simply click on double click for example on 8c 868 click on that one for example double click on it right double click on the 8c the actual number double click on number number number number click on the number there we go and change to a different color for example um you know uh click on the yeah the the square the square not the square the square yeah oh it can't okay f f f f no do like f f f there we go decline hit enter so what you can lock that color so lock it for example lock that color you see there's a lock button nice lock it now click space now check this out oh wow we'll find colors that you know a color palette around those colors like that now that my friends is is is very very useful okay so keep clicking space and you will see start to see more color palettes more color palettes and so forth so the thing that i like about this is you know a huge thing about color palettes is palette colors that go together that you know that's why it's called a palette so what i like about this specifically is the fact that you know you got to think about the sort of the feeling that a color gives you right so orange and yellow or more kind of like an important type of you know vibe so it gives you something to look at it's kind of like a warning sign you know warning signs are this color kind of like danger all of these so orange and colors theory orange is the opposite of blue so you're pairing up different shades of blue with different shades of orange or yellow itself so all of these are going to be very useful for you when you're building things as well yeah and so and somebody and you guys asked like you know does color theory work i mean yes color color theory works guys i mean look at the lights like look at look at our for example lights stop lights okay right why do we have red as this light for stop and why do we have green as the light to go because genetically evolutionary red means bad red means stop blood et cetera et cetera exactly red means blood red means stop man ransom means no no go red means warning versus green means money green means do it green means go exactly so that's why it does you know and it's all psychology um it's very important guys exactly there's a reason why you know facebook is blue why linkedin is blue all of these companies are blue blue is you know trust so we can dive into this a little bit a lot of people are developers that are designers as well and they don't know psychology of colors by the way guys smash that like button for us we have i i know you i think we're giving you guys some amazing stuff out here so smash that like button how many likes do we have right now i don't know i'm not sure i think we have like i think we have like 400 or 500 let's smash it up you know hit that hit it you know just kind of double click it triple click it hit that smash button guys thank you thank you for being here so right here i'm going to show you guys a little bit of the color psychology right so like i said before blue is equal to trust let me write down a little bit let me see if i can actually zoom in a little bit more for you guys so here right you know it shows that blue is trust peace loyalty and competence so most of the big companies that you guys see are actually blue you know twitter facebook linkedin like i said all of these are blue it doesn't mean that you can't have any other colors it just means that it's very used because of this fact and then you know green is more of that nature field you know sometimes you even have a plant that is a fake plant and it makes you feel like you know it's alive like you're in nature so green really does make you feel like this sort of healing type of vibe to it so a lot of apps like the stay focused app which is something that i use for productivity it's actually a pomodoro app as well uses green a lot then you know yellow can be happiness warmth all of these warm colors are you know they call it warm colors because they make you feel some sort of feeling of warmth love you know why why is that do you know why i don't know man even you know even you can see if you do dissect a bunch of painters like picasso and all of these guys they had different sorts of seasons in their paintings so picasso had a specific season in his painting where they call it literally called the blue period where this guy was creating so much specific like sad and impressive moments although blue is you know trust peace and loyalty it can also symbolize cold so being cold is kind of sad so these are warmer colors and these green blue pink and purple are the the fresh colors so they're actually more cold if you're trying to go in for a more cold look you can use purple you can use blue but you know you got to be aware of that that's why they use the the actual you know the quote that says something like i'm feeling blue today or i'm blue yeah but like i think um so you know i think the reason why it's actually like for example blue not blue but like yellow orange and red like make you feel warm um because guys look at the sun what color is the sun it's yellow it's orange okay and what does it make us do it makes us feel warm and so like it's it's so crazy to think about this but this is all from like hundreds and thousands of years ago that we have built this association with the fact that blue not blue but yellow for example or orange means warm colors like it's it's just insane to think about that but again it's all because of like you know evolution evolution and kind of how we were raised and you know how people we changed and sun i think had a really big part in that meeting so it's just something to think about yep and it's all part of nature you know so yeah green part of nature blue ocean is blue you know pink your flowers are pink i don't know so all of these things are there so you know daniel does bring a good question and he says nas is there any resource or course you can recommend for a developer who wants to learn basics of ui and ux um we're gonna learn basics of ui and ux um i mean trying to learn basics of javascript and a great ui development profile javascript is one of them link in description um but if you want to use for example just ui ux we don't have a course on that for example from clever programmer but there are amazing youtube videos on ui ux design and there's a lot you know udemy or youtube videos a lot of courses on that um i would highly recommend the best way to actually learn uiux is honestly just simply through practice so go to for example like dribble so one of my friends actually for the way he learned is he would go to dribble he would sort something up he would see you know for example like maybe it's his app and he would take that app and he would design it by himself the exact same design and then he will then he will change it you know some minor things and so as he did more and more and more that stuff he kind of started to get understanding and uh of what things are and what things should look like um so it all kind of just comes from practice but if you want to take a course you know youtube is a great resource you know udem is a great resource and if you're not actually learning great design together with us uh together with development then profit with javascript is another amazing resource yep yep so i'd say you know guys dive into creating your own projects dive into actually copying or modeling great companies out there so a great way to practice ui ux design would be to study companies like apple study you know how they make their apps how they make their fitness app how they make the alarm clock app i think i heard i don't know if it was um either tim cook or steve jobs who said something like we're trying to get all functionalities to work inside of three clicks you know three clicks of your button on the screen yeah so i don't know exactly who that was but that's actually a very good point to actually talk about because and when you're designing you know sometimes people think of these like super complex designs of things of their apps and they're trying to build a huge like oh yeah an experience where you can click here and click here and click here but that just makes your app not being not easy to use you know at the end of the day if your app has a bad experience user experience and also user interface people are not going to use it no matter what no matter what type of thing your app does or tries to yes it's all about balancing and i tell this to a lot of students it's all about balancing user experience um like ease ease of use with a great design you know because you can have amazing you can have you know some complex design for example you know you have some compass design where like you hover over something and then and then it displays some text but then you gotta ask the question is this actually useful or is this actually difficult for the user user to to use um i actually i learned this really cool trick uh this really cool trick um at some point it was like the last brain power a user has to use to you for your application the better your app is going to do brain power and brain power is everything brain power is an extra click is an extra brain power right an extra even like hover over with your mouse is more brain power so the last brain power your user can use to see what what they want to see the better you'll do so let's just keep that in mind just keep that kind of like you know kind of like that seed always in your head awesome so i'm going to bring a few questions here now this one is a great question that the greatest ever brings up it's actually just kind of a comment or a statement he says ecommerce are great to have i have done a few and they always impress because they are also very practical so i feel like ecommerce projects are a great way to study two things design and then also web development it's actually one of our most asked for projects so we're probably going to dive into that in the next few live streams so nas i know you've you know worked with so many companies by now so do you have any experience building ecommerce sites yourself i have i have both an ecommerce site yes um and i mean it's fun one just one you know it's a it's a fun one because it involves a lot of a lot of functionalities right because you're not thinking you're not just building just a landing page you're building a page that will maintain products you'll build a page that will allow people to buy things that will allow people to check out that will allow people right to you know get shipping information um so i highly like this kind of project because there's just so many parts to it and then you know you're just going to learn like yeah your learning process is going to grow exponentially with it um but yeah yeah if you can if you want to build an ecommerce site i'll recommend that definitely definitely recommend that you know but at the end of the day like devin grace says is you know you do get decision fatigue if right now you know you're trying to build this you're trying to make that design you're trying to click here and you're trying to click there you know always simplify the variables that you're working with because and that goes into design that goes into productivity into app development you know everything that is secondary kind of leave it to the side and just focus on the primary and so you know that's a huge part of design and development in general so devin does bring up a good great point how did you go into development and designing specifically nas because i know that you know you're huge on it you're very good at it as well whether that's you know web app development or just you know designing in general like photoshop and stuff so yeah how was that for you um i think for me just kind of came from experience um i wrote i started out as a developer just kind of building some basic sites right and then what happened is as you build more sites as you build more applications um as you work you know with more companies you know you get to see great design right you work with other designers for example maybe there's you know a designer who's working at the company and you know he's showing you how to make a great design and so you get pointers from there and then you get pointers from a few different places and so forth and then and then dribble comes along you're like oh this is awesome you know and dribble came along and then everything was good and then you implement um kind of your design decisions and then you see how people react to them and and from that you kind of you learn and you you do pattern recognition um and and with that that kind of builds so yeah it all kind of came from experience guys definitely man that's that's awesome i know that right now a great you know this is just a bonus right here but and i'm not logged into my account or anything but envato is one of the biggest platforms for designers in the world right now and right here you can actually even get you know freelancing clients you can build your own portfolios and you know share your own creations with other people and envato is one of the biggest communities for designers like i said in the world so give that one a look it's kind of like dribble kind of like lapa like nas was saying so all of these are going to be inspirational tools they're going to be very valuable if you have on your tool set and you bring them up as skills because ultimately you have the tools but then you have to develop the skills to use the tools and you know at the end of the day the tools are just going to help you become more efficient you know the tools are not the endall beall but it's a good addition to things you know let's say you're trying to build a house without a hammer then what are you gonna do use a stone maybe but it's gonna be harder for you so just use a hammer don't use the stone guys don't use this don't use a hammer frankie will use a stone okay so yeah i'll use a stone yeah i'll be like patrick so don't mind me and in conclusion guys you know we put here uh really a quote from steve jobs we think this guy is super iconic we love you know his philosophy his design style and his products man we're working on max right now so that's that's pretty awesome and what does he say nas you cannot mandate productivity you must provide the tools to let people become their best right so what does that mean to you to me it means that to me it means that productivity like you can't force productivity you have to give people the right tools to be productive now example is like you know let's say you put people in an office that with slow computers and with no ac and a very horrible environment are they going to be productive no but if you pee but if you give people the right tools the right knowledge if you give people you know for example it maybe if you give um an artist you know amazing amazing paper and amazing pencils to draw with he's going to draw some amazing things if you give a developer a great computer that's a great computer that that you know you can you can you can use he's going to create some amazing things right if you give a um if you give um a contractor you know a contractor who fixes houses you give him all the right tools all the the drills all the you know all the things that to make his work faster and easier and better he's going to do amazing work and so that's how i see it because without those you know it's going to be a lot harder for you now they don't define you but it's going to be a lot harder for you yeah man i feel like you know tools are hugely important i never really understood the importance of them until i started working with this company to be honest you know i've been you know very into gadgets a lot so i understand it but in general i had never really applied tools into the workspace and once you do that man it's like you realize that something was missing you know yeah tools are essential for your growth because it's like having other type of senses so right now we have you know we can talk we can we can feel we can listen we can you know all of our senses we can see all of these things but tools really do you know extend the way that you interact with the world so whether that's through a community you know community tools trying to talk to people sharing your code using loom using all of these things that we talked about you know whether that's extensions for your you know text editor any of those things that simplify the way that you work with what you already have all of these things are just you know extensions of your own skills so applying them to an actual practical way is going to take you a long way and it's also going to differentiate you from other people but the cool thing is like you can show other people your tools and you can literally change their life so like i said before in this live stream guys time is the most important asset that we have you know money is always replenishable time is never replenishable so if you can find a tool that can you know minimize the time that you spend doing something that literally means that you're getting more life back so you're having more time for your life for other things that you want to actually do you know so all of these are some of the things that i think are important yeah yeah i would agree with that i know time is something you guys don't get back but one thing i want to mention it's very important guys for you is do not let tools also define you at the end of the day right you know it's not about getting the most tools you possibly can at the end of the day focus on the learning focus on the doing you know and let the tools kind of help you out let the tools kind of make you more efficient all right but as a developer as a developer you don't gotta you don't gotta need a bunch of tools right you don't gotta need all the tools in the world you need this which is what your brain that's the ultimate tool that's the old now that my friends the ultimate tool guys give us some fire for our brain guys in the comments below guys are pretty our brains are pretty damn good it's the tool of tools it's the tool that creates all tools this is the most powerful tool in the world right there exactly exactly so nas we went over a lot of different tools a lot of different things what do you think are the things that stick out the most for you so what are what is the things that you use the most yourself you know because i know we had a huge list there you guys can go back check them out there's tools for everything you know regarding communication regarding you know version control regarding you know text editors in general extensions for them we went over even you know design tools even some resources that you can use for your web development and web design projects so what are kind of the tools that just stuck out to you the most that you actually use the most not so i think for me the most tools that i i like um that i think the most useful is so we talk about communication tools um and as you guys know communication is is is so vital in development or just in any job in general and so for example tools like slack tools like trello tools like asana they make us better than make us efficient like literally guys i'm not kidding this team would not be where it is right now without slack do you agree with me completely like without slack and i remember you brought it you brought it into the conversation i don't know i don't know who brought it i i don't know who brought it maybe i did maybe i didn't i don't know all right you're being humble that's cool that's cool now is humble give it up for nas hey who's pumped put it in the comments below who's pumped but i think the most important guy i think guys is like right those specific tools are very important so you know for any project and when i worked on university projects when i worked on you know at a company slack was extremely important for me you know trello was extremely important for me that was the basic things the most space then the next most important tool you know is obviously git that is one is like it's like right there you you cannot go wrong with it you have to learn it because you're gonna be using that as a developer all the time okay um and then and then what i would highly recommend as well is once you've kind of gotten those some other tools are really nice are of course are going to be like loom like dropper and some really like like droplets again to again to communicate so i just mentioned a lot of communication tools so yeah i would also say that is my endall beall communication tools yep so communication tools are gonna really you know facilitate the way that you share with others your experience your code your whatever project that you're working in i agree with you man slack to me is one of the most important ones that we've used up until this point just because it's been so easy to communicate with the team to file share to you know write notes for myself whenever i'm working on a project i use slack so that's to me it's one of the most important ones i have to say man for me i love going back to you know optimizing my workflow using alfred four and yoink wow that really changed my whole life like not only my work life but literally my whole life and i was like how you know how did i live without these tools alfred specifically and then yoink you know touching on them a little bit again so this one is the clipboard and the search bar instead of using the native mac search bar i use alfred and it's way way better guys so you know do invest a little bit into these tools i think they're gonna change your life and actually save you guys a lot of time those are a few of the tools that i use the most another one for me that is huge is going to be you know things like dribble and things like you know envato all of these things like pinterest that give you a lot of ideas onto how to work you know how to see other people's projects and make them your own what to integrate what not to what looks good what doesn't look good what type of trends are going on in europe what type of trends are going on in web design you know whether that's last year this year we can compare them and that's going to give you a lot of reference experience onto how to actually you know build stuff what i've found the most in my design is the fact that design is all about style so you know whenever you try to whenever you copy a style that somebody else has then it's like you all of a sudden like you don't know anything but you copy somebody else's style that has been doing web development or web design for a long time then you look like a pro you know because these guys have actually done the work for a few years they have refined a few skills that you haven't picked up yet so by modeling other people's designs that's how you're gonna get a good style and your style dictates whether that design is good or not and obviously the style and the user experience like we mentioned are the huge things for that yeah exactly exactly um yeah those tools yeah just guys i i think when i found out about alfred it was very helpful for me i was like holy moly no way um and i think yoink uh really improved my workflow as well um i i want to give a shout out really quickly here guys because there are some amazing people who are in the chat kind of as we were as we were kind

guys you know if you do have any more intelligent questions that you guys want to answer drop them right now in the comments nasa's gonna answer a few here's one that i think might be you know important for a few people to understand because i've seen it a lot of times being popped up so armand lohan asks is learning react beginner friendly no what would you say to this uh yes yes yes i mean i mean i would say for example start out with javascript just kind of learn some basics of javascript um because there's a good learning curve to react um so learn some basic javascript which by the way you can learn from you know profit joseph course link in description um so learn some basics javascript some basics of html css and then dive straight into react and you're going to be golden from there yep yep so danielle does bring another one that's i think important he asks i agree but when you go to freelancing sites such as fiverr upwork you notice that good percentage of the web developers jobs there are wordpress based so more people need wordpress so wordpress is actually huge i know that it all i think it's like 70 of the web uses wordpress something insane like that probably yeah more than 60 for sure so i know that right now web development is is super in it's super hip everybody's trying to learn it and everything wordpress has been along around for a long long time do you have any experience with wordpress in general on us oh yeah when i guys when i first started freelancing guys i've been i was building wordpress sites left and right um yeah wordpress is a big one and it's a great one for for example let's say you are doing freelancing wordpress is a great one to start out with and mainly because i mean there's just so many jobs out there for wordpress and so many you know companies who want to create um sites and so many co and so many you know different people who want to use wordpress for other different tools um but yeah no uh learn it as well and you know especially for freelancing very useful and it's it's it's a great technology and it will never go away i know huge huge companies use wordpress i know tim ferriss uses wordpress he
