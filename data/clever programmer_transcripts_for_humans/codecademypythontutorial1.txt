00:00 - hey guys how are you doing so today I'm
00:03 - going to take on a very interesting
00:04 - challenge which is going to be I'm going
00:06 - to go through the entire code Academy
00:09 - course and try to finish it as fast as I
00:11 - can and along the way my goal is to be
00:13 - able to help you guys give you guys some
00:15 - kind of intuition and for most of the
00:18 - people that are stuck this is going to
00:20 - help you kind of get unstuck and think
00:23 - about code um in a little bit of a
00:27 - different way I hope so I hope that this
00:29 - video helps you and it helps you solve
00:33 - those frustrating annoying problems
00:35 - because I remember when I was going
00:36 - through this I didn't have any help and
00:38 - I would quit for weeks at a time because
00:43 - I simply did not know where to go even
00:46 - the forms didn't help me so that's
00:49 - pretty much my main point to help
00:52 - everybody else out there so we're going
00:55 - to be taking the code Academy course
00:56 - here and we're going to be taking in the
00:59 - language called Python and there tons of
01:02 - students enrolled here 2.5 million it's
01:05 - a fairly long long course and the level
01:10 - required is beginner so unit 1 it's
01:15 - syntax
01:16 - tip calculator unit 2 talks about
01:18 - strings date and time and as we get
01:22 - further down we go into more and more
01:24 - useful and more advanced things so
01:26 - conditionals and control flow is going
01:28 - to be fun functions dictionaries and
01:33 - pretty much all of the stuff here
01:35 - battleships is going to be a lot of fun
01:38 - so feel free to use this video as a
01:41 - resource to help you if you get stuck or
01:43 - for entertainment you know just sit
01:45 - through and watch along how I tackle
01:49 - these problems ok so the first one is
01:53 - python is an easy programming language
01:56 - you can use it to create web apps games
02:00 - even a search engine I agree
02:03 - ready to learn Python click Save and
02:05 - submit ok so the first problem is
02:07 - already done all I have to do is hit
02:09 - save and submit code
02:11 - okay max streak of one start next lesson
02:16 - so creating web apps games and search
02:19 - engines all involve storing and working
02:22 - with different types of data they do so
02:23 - using variables variable stores a piece
02:27 - of data and gives a specific name for
02:30 - example spam is equal to five so
02:34 - basically here they're teaching you how
02:36 - to store a variable name so what I need
02:40 - to do they gave me the steps to do it
02:42 - right over here
02:43 - so I'm going to say my variable is equal
02:48 - to 10 and that's pretty much all I need
02:51 - to do here so that was very simple set
02:56 - the variables to the values listed in
02:58 - the instructions not a big deal is equal
03:00 - to true B is equal to false and we're
03:04 - done so they're talking about boolean's
03:07 - here boolean values are basically true
03:10 - and false so like they say a light
03:13 - switch you know boom one is on one is
03:17 - off oh my int whoops forgot to add that
03:23 - oh then want me to actually that was
03:26 - just an example so we got to do my n2 is
03:30 - equal to 7 my float equal to one point
03:33 - two three my bool is equals true this
03:37 - should be good all right
03:40 - you've been reassigned so here we're
03:44 - going to try to reassign values so
03:45 - initially my int was seven and then I'm
03:48 - going to change my into three and that's
03:51 - pretty much it for this one sweet okay
03:56 - now we get into functions and functions
03:59 - are fairly cool this code is poorly
04:01 - formatted because every time you write
04:04 - des right you gotta indent four spaces
04:09 - four or more spaces after you write that
04:13 - : this is called a function so we wrote
04:16 - a function called spam and what it does
04:19 - is it makes x equals 12 and then it
04:22 - returns
04:23 - so since these instructions they're part
04:28 - of the overall function so these need to
04:30 - be indented right underneath the
04:32 - function let's go ahead and indent this
04:34 - and let's hit submit and this should
04:37 - work okay good white space means right
04:43 - space so in Python remember white space
04:46 - is very important and once again we need
04:48 - to indent all of these otherwise we will
04:51 - get errors a matter of interpretation a
04:56 - window in the top right corner of the
04:58 - page is called interpreter so basically
05:03 - it's that black window the little black
05:07 - window on top right and the interpreter
05:11 - runs your code line by line and checks
05:13 - for any errors so in this example they
05:16 - make a variable called katz and assign
05:18 - it the value 3 so we're supposed to
05:21 - create a variable called spam and set it
05:24 - to true and we're supposed to create a
05:26 - variable called eggs and assign it the
05:30 - value false ok great
05:32 - just to make sure the video is recording
05:34 - okay single line comments and comments
05:40 - or things that are ignored in Python and
05:43 - there are things that are ignored in any
05:45 - programming language so the point of a
05:48 - comment is you're telling the Machine
05:51 - hey
05:52 - don't read this ok read everything else
05:55 - but just don't read anything that has
05:57 - some special symbol next to it
05:59 - telling the machine that it's a comment
06:01 - it's meant to be only read by a human
06:03 - being and the computer has nothing to do
06:06 - with it right so if I said 5 plus 5 the
06:09 - computer might give me back a 10 but if
06:11 - I put as a comment and I did this the
06:14 - computer's not going to give me back
06:16 - anything right if I did this the
06:19 - computer might give me back a syntax
06:21 - error or something right if I if I have
06:23 - semicolons like this but if I did this
06:25 - and made it into a comment the computer
06:27 - is just going to ignore it that's really
06:30 - the point behind
06:32 - behind hashtags their overall comments
06:37 - so it says make sure
06:41 - write a comment on line one make sure it
06:43 - starts with so we can say anything we
06:45 - want right hi I am a very clever
06:50 - programmer okay cool so multi-line
06:58 - comments the idea is that I can say
07:00 - stuff like hello how are you doing today
07:07 - five plus five is ten million pretty
07:14 - much I can say anything that I want and
07:16 - this is a multi-line comment okay so
07:20 - we're done set count equal the basically
07:25 - the point of a multi-line comment is you
07:28 - can just write multi lines and you don't
07:31 - have to put the hashtag over and over
07:32 - and over again it's also useful for
07:35 - documentation later on when you learn
07:38 - what documentation is for now since
07:40 - you're probably learning this language
07:41 - on code Academy and you're watching this
07:44 - video I'm assuming that you don't know
07:47 - what documentation is because you're
07:49 - most likely a beginner but if you're not
07:51 - that's okay too great now let's do some
07:56 - math so in programming languages you can
07:59 - do you can do a lot of math okay there's
08:01 - a lot of the math stuff that you can do
08:03 - which is fun so for example if I opened
08:06 - up my terminal I can I can do I can open
08:14 - a Python and actually let's just do
08:19 - regular Python if I did five plus five I
08:21 - did ten plus ten you know ten times
08:26 - twenty so on and so forth you can do you
08:29 - can do math operations so let's do
08:33 - addition Oh
08:34 - set the variable count to equal the sum
08:37 - of two big numbers
08:40 - okay what does it mean big numbers I
08:45 - don't know 100 plus 200 sure I mean I
08:51 - don't know how big of the numbers of the
08:54 - wanted but I just put some arbitrary
08:56 - numbers 100 and 300 fairly big
09:00 - exponentiation so we're going to learn
09:02 - about how to use the exponent in Python
09:04 - and most of the most of the places
09:06 - you'll see the exponent like this right
09:09 - something raised to the power of some
09:11 - things if I did 2 raised to the power of
09:14 - 2 that's 4 if I did 4 to the raise to
09:18 - the power of 2 that's 16 4 squared and
09:21 - here we're going to do a and we're going
09:25 - to say to a new variable called eggs and
09:28 - use exponent set X is equal to 100 I'm
09:31 - going to do it like this I'm going to
09:34 - say 10 squared right that gives me a
09:37 - hundred so this should run perfectly we
09:44 - got the result 100 we got the little
09:46 - green checkmark at the bottom so let's
09:48 - keep going
09:51 - so now let's talk about the modular
09:53 - operator it's basically the remainder so
09:56 - if you had 10 modulo 2 well what's the
10:00 - remainder if you did 10/2 doesn't to go
10:04 - perfectly into 10 so let's just make
10:09 - this clear and I did 10 divided by 2 I
10:12 - have no leftovers right it goes
10:14 - perfectly to tents if I did 10 modulo 2
10:18 - I should have a remainder of 0 nothing
10:20 - is left over but if I did 11 divided by
10:23 - 2 well 2 doesn't go perfectly into 11
10:27 - because 11 is an odd number so if I did
10:29 - 11 remainder of 2 what do you think I'm
10:33 - going to get back to goats perfectly
10:35 - into 10 and then there's one left over
10:37 - so my remainder is going to be if you
10:40 - have guests already it's going to be one
10:42 - okay so that's simply what our remainder
10:44 - is now let me just ask you what do you
10:46 - think the remainder of 99 divided by
10:49 - Manjula - is going to be so remember 98
10:55 - - goes perfectly into 98 and then you
10:58 - have one over so you get remainder is
11:01 - going to be one here how about 100
11:03 - modulo modulo - right how about 100
11:07 - modulo 3 what you get so once again 99 3
11:13 - is going to go into 99 you get one left
11:15 - over and you're going to get a remainder
11:17 - of 1 so sometimes you want to get the
11:19 - remainder right of whatever you're doing
11:21 - so it's gonna it's a pretty useful
11:24 - operator to have at our disposal because
11:27 - then we can use it fairly easily
11:31 - so here use modulus at spam equal to 1
11:35 - so once again we did 99 we did 100
11:38 - modulo 3 and that's going to give us
11:40 - back 1 remember we tested it out so
11:43 - that's how we're going to make spam
11:45 - equal to 1 see use modulus spam equal to
11:48 - 1 you can use any two numbers that will
11:50 - ever mater want to do this cool extra
11:52 - view bringing it all together variables
11:57 - which store values for later data types
12:01 - such as numbers and boolean's so
12:03 - variables are like you know X is equal
12:06 - to 5 y is equal to 2 those are all your
12:09 - variables okay data types are in Python
12:13 - you'll you have you know give numbers
12:16 - you have strings you can have a list you
12:22 - can have a dictionary so once again if
12:24 - you don't know what a list or dictionary
12:26 - is just ignore this so it's not a
12:27 - problem don't worry about it but just
12:29 - remember like 5 and hello those are
12:32 - different kind of data types
12:33 - hello is a string or what if I had a
12:36 - true in here right remember with the
12:38 - word for true and false says source with
12:40 - the B bool ok boolean so true and false
12:45 - they're going to be boolean values
12:49 - whitespace so that's what separates the
12:52 - statements if I had X is equal to 5 and
12:55 - now I'm doing Y is equal to 4 that's
12:58 - separating the statement X 5
12:59 - and why for you know you can't just do y
13:02 - equals 4 on the same line you got to
13:04 - give it some white space in white space
13:07 - just means blank and blank means
13:09 - something very important in Python so if
13:11 - you did define f of nothing and it says
13:16 - print hello well it's not going to work
13:20 - if you have if you don't have that white
13:23 - space before the print so in Python what
13:26 - white space is very very important in
13:28 - Lang other languages white space doesn't
13:30 - matter you just put squigglies around
13:32 - everything but comments okay comments
13:37 - how can I make this line a comment just
13:39 - add a hashtag before it okay comment my
13:44 - code will run until ignore it it won't
13:46 - give me a syntax or nothing you'll just
13:48 - is just going to ignore and arithmetic
13:52 - operations that's pretty straightforward
13:54 - plus minus sign subtraction addition
13:58 - multiplication of two numbers division
14:01 - exponentiation of two numbers our
14:03 - multiple numbers and then the module
14:05 - operator right the module operator that
14:07 - we played with so it says write a single
14:09 - line comment on line one I'm going to
14:11 - say hello YouTube audience I'm assuming
14:16 - that's how you're watching this video
14:19 - set the variable mod T equal to true and
14:24 - set another variable Python equal to one
14:27 - point two three four and set the third
14:30 - variable Monty Python equal to Python
14:37 - squared right I'm taking this Python and
14:41 - I'm squaring it okay cool
14:48 - so what is the start lesson sure let's
14:54 - start the lesson I mean
14:57 - that's what I'm here for right doing
14:59 - these lessons now let's apply the
15:03 - concepts from the previous section to a
15:05 - real-world example okay so now we're
15:11 - getting to some fun part of the code so
15:14 - you've finished eating a restaurant and
15:15 - receive this bill you'll apply the tip
15:18 - to the overall cost of the meal
15:20 - including tax first let's declare the
15:24 - variable meal and assign it the value of
15:26 - 40 for 50s so here when there's a meal
15:28 - and that is equal to 40 450 the reason
15:32 - why you always see me have spaces here
15:35 - is because that's writing good code
15:37 - that's just trying to make my code
15:40 - cleaner because when it's tightly
15:43 - compacted together like that it's hard
15:45 - for a human to read and it reduces the
15:48 - readability so this is the standard way
15:51 - to do this and it's accepted and it's
15:53 - the convention so you should practice
15:57 - writing good code as you're starting
16:00 - your careers okay so I have this meal
16:04 - and those are all my instructions meal
16:08 - tax is equal to 6.75% another way to
16:14 - write 6.75 is point zero six seven five
16:18 - and because remember 6.75% is really the
16:25 - same thing as six point seven five
16:28 - divided by 100 okay so if I run this
16:33 - code again it's going to work
16:36 - assign the tip variable on line five
16:39 - okay so tip set the variable tip to
16:43 - decimal value of 15% on line five okay
16:50 - so what we're going to do here so the
16:53 - variable tip to decimal value fifteen
16:55 - percent on line five
16:56 - okay so
16:59 - that's the decimal value of 15%
17:02 - wait that's oh ok so they're using
17:12 - Python 2 and here I just want to explain
17:16 - it really quickly so what just happened
17:18 - was you saw me do 15 divided by 100 and
17:21 - then it gave me an error and then I
17:22 - added that little decimal zero
17:25 - afterwards and then all of a sudden it
17:27 - says a way to go click next lesson so
17:30 - I'm going to explain to you why what if
17:31 - those work and why one of the one of
17:33 - them didn't work ok so if I did 15
17:38 - divided by a hundred in Python 3 I'm
17:42 - going to get a decimal value ok but in
17:45 - Python 2 let me show you what happens ok
17:47 - so let me activate my Python 2 here so I
17:51 - can show you guys what happens and let's
17:56 - say 15 divided by 100 so notice what
17:59 - happened it gave me a 0 that's weird so
18:01 - here's what it does if I did 10 divided
18:06 - by 3 it's going to give me the perfect
18:10 - number of times 3 goes into 10 okay it's
18:13 - not going to give me a decimal value if
18:15 - I want to do that I have to make sure
18:18 - that I'm telling the computer that I'm
18:20 - passing in an integer like a float
18:22 - number a decimal number once I tell it
18:25 - that it knows to give me the exact value
18:28 - but otherwise it'll just tell me how
18:31 - many times some number goes into another
18:33 - number if I did once again hundred
18:35 - divided by three I'm going to get 33 ok
18:39 - I'm not going to get 33 point 3 3 3
18:41 - whatever I should get if I did 100
18:44 - divided by 0.3 point 0 then I will get
18:48 - that so what was happening here was when
18:50 - I did 15 divided by a hundred it was
18:53 - like hundred goes zero times into 15
18:57 - because it's trying to give me a whole
18:58 - number but when I do point 0 now it says
19:03 - 15 divided by 100 and it gives me some
19:05 - small decimal value ok that decimal
19:08 - value will be point zero one five
19:11 - so here if I can show you 15/100
19:15 - it's going to be 0.15 sorry I meant to
19:19 - 0.15 reassign in a single line okay
19:23 - we've got three variables we need to
19:24 - perform our calculation we know some
19:26 - arithmetic operations that can help us
19:28 - out
19:29 - so we saw in Lesson one we could suspend
19:32 - is equal to 7 then later change your
19:34 - mind and say this like a cool on line 7
19:36 - assign meal to the value so meal to the
19:41 - value of itself plus itself times tax so
19:46 - pretty much like this ok so no like this
19:55 - okay right no no no I had it correct
20:04 - first all right so here I'm saying if
20:07 - the meal was $44 that's just $44 $44 50
20:12 - Cent's and then the menial times the tax
20:16 - is the tax you have to pay
20:19 - okay so 44.50 and the tax you have to
20:23 - pay on that is point zero six so this is
20:27 - your tax this is your meal meal plus tax
20:31 - that's the entire amount that you have
20:33 - to pay for your meal okay
20:35 - fairly simple total assign the variable
20:41 - total to the sum of meal plus on line
20:43 - eight now you have the total cost of
20:45 - your meal assign the riddle total to the
20:49 - sum now you have the total cost of your
20:51 - meal I'm confused is really saying do
20:56 - this now
20:58 - I'm saying total is equal to meal plus
21:06 - tip maybe Oh Oh doh okay
21:11 - so it's basically meal plus the tip that
21:14 - we paid on the meal okay so the same
21:16 - logic implies yeah though so meal how
21:21 - much you paid for the meal that's your
21:23 - total okay so the new meal is this whole
21:27 - thing here so this variable here is
21:30 - holding your information for the meal
21:33 - itself and the tax that you paid on it
21:35 - and then this part here is calculating
21:39 - the tip that you paid based on your meal
21:40 - so that's going to be your total this
21:43 - takes into account the money that you
21:45 - paid for your meal it takes into account
21:48 - the tip that you paid based on your on
21:50 - your meal and it takes into account the
21:52 - tax based on your meal okay next strings
21:58 - and console.log
22:08 - I'm going to create a variable called
22:11 - Brian and I'm going to assign it the
22:14 - value hello hello life okay this is
22:20 - called the string string means literally
22:23 - I can put anything I want in there okay
22:26 - it's not going to throw an error it's
22:28 - not going to do anything it's just
22:29 - completely arbitrary and it's just
22:31 - completely made-up whatever you want to
22:33 - put in it that's what a string is okay
22:37 - when you're writing the word document in
22:40 - Python those would be like all it's all
22:42 - every single word in there is you know
22:44 - it's all a string that's what it is
22:46 - because hello life is not a variable it
22:50 - doesn't have any value attached to it
22:52 - but Brian is a variable because if you
22:55 - typed in Brian you would get back hello
22:57 - life cool let's move on
23:00 - so now let's practice let's get a little
23:02 - practice in strings so set Caesar is
23:06 - equal to graham Caesar is equal to
23:10 - Graham and pray line praline and
23:15 - probably sing it wrong equal to John and
23:20 - Viking is equal to Teresa and those are
23:27 - all strings okay and that's pretty much
23:29 - it here the string below is broken fix
23:32 - it using the scape backslash this isn't
23:34 - flying this is a falling with stop so
23:36 - skip backslash what that means is okay
23:40 - look you have you're trying to put this
23:42 - entire thing into a string right you
23:46 - want to put this entire thing with
23:47 - quotes around it so whether you put
23:49 - single quotes or double quotes it
23:51 - doesn't matter but what the main problem
23:54 - is happening here is it's a it's
23:57 - thinking that this apostrophe in isn't
24:00 - it's thinking that it's ending the
24:03 - ending the string so it thinks this part
24:06 - is a string and then it just has no idea
24:09 - what this whole part is right it thinks
24:11 - this whole part if I separated it out it
24:15 - thinks this whole part is just some
24:16 - gibberish and this part is the actual
24:19 - string but what we want is we
24:21 - want the whole thing to be a string so
24:23 - one solution would be
24:25 - I put double quotes here and I put
24:26 - double quotes here but that's not the
24:28 - answer that they want okay they want us
24:30 - to do something that escapes a backslash
24:32 - so this is what we're gonna do okay and
24:37 - what that means is it's saying this is
24:40 - an apostrophe and I don't want you to
24:43 - think of it as a quote okay that's all
24:45 - that does that's Collins you know the
24:47 - term Ford escaping escape backslash okay
24:50 - so you're escaping the quote by putting
24:54 - a backslash there so now the whole thing
24:57 - has turned into a string and that's it
25:01 - okay now we have the string python has
25:04 - six characters number zero to five as
25:07 - shown below all right so now let's try
25:09 - to get the fifth character so I'm going
25:12 - to do how do I get the fifth character
25:16 - so what do I want me to do here
25:18 - fifth letter goes in a blood of string
25:21 - mod T all right so the fifth letter is
25:24 - going to be n here right because that's
25:27 - the fifth letter here weight start
25:33 - cutting right so 0 1 2 3 4 5 oh I see
25:42 - they want us to start counting from here
25:43 - so 1 2 3 4 5 so oh no no I'm wrong it's
25:50 - still N but I just didn't put it in what
26:06 - what is going on so if you wanted Y you
26:12 - could just type
26:31 - this is weird how today how do they want
26:35 - this not sure how they want this oh oh
26:45 - okay I feel I feel feel a little law not
26:51 - good I think for here all right I'm kind
27:02 - of lost this is this is super oh my god
27:11 - they're saying Monty Monty okay Monty
27:15 - all right now remember the reason why so
27:19 - the fifth letter is really the fourth
27:21 - letter because we start from zero so one
27:23 - two three four five
27:27 - but in our case the word was Monty okay
27:30 - and that's what tripped me up so here
27:33 - for us the word is actually Monty so let
27:37 - me actually write that down here
27:43 - and that's that's what it is
27:47 - for us okay okay that's what it is for
27:56 - us that's how we got Monty in the fifth
27:58 - letter ignore the top part that's only
28:02 - an example I constantly was trying to
28:04 - use that okay let's move on string
28:06 - methods okay Len lower/upper string
28:08 - great so these are pretty cool methods
28:13 - you know you can use this one to get a
28:15 - length of a string so let's say you had
28:17 - something like hello my name is Rafa
28:20 - Kazi and I'm a programmer is going to
28:23 - tell you like hey the length of that
28:24 - string is huge that's like a lot of
28:27 - letters in there if you said hello right
28:31 - if I try to get a length so let me let
28:34 - me show you guys these here so if I said
28:37 - a Len of hello well that's five right
28:41 - there five letters in it now let's say I
28:44 - did a hello dot lower what do you think
28:47 - that's going to do that's just going to
28:48 - make Hello all lowercase
28:51 - let's say I had a you know a bunch of
28:55 - capital o whatever letters is going to
28:57 - make it all lower well what do you think
29:00 - the upper upper is going to do you're
29:03 - just going to do the it's going to is
29:06 - simply going to do the opposite of that
29:09 - so if we had you know a bunch of small
29:12 - letters and like this is going to make
29:14 - them all upper case okay so that's
29:19 - really what's going on there okay this
29:25 - doesn't need to be this wide come closer
29:29 - all right cool make sense all right and
29:33 - string what this does is it just
29:37 - converts something to a string so if I
29:39 - had a number like five it's going to
29:43 - give me back a string five okay so like
29:46 - let's say I did five plus five well you
29:48 - can do that but let's say you try to do
29:49 - five plus five you can't you can't add
29:55 - those so what it does is it just
29:57 - add some together just like if you said
29:58 - hello plus everyone okay it's just going
30:06 - to just going to concatenate them so
30:09 - what it did is it added the fives
30:10 - together it's not really looking at them
30:14 - like numbers is just looking at them
30:16 - like strings so it doesn't know that
30:19 - it's an integer type and it can add them
30:21 - together anymore all it can do is
30:24 - concatenate them and do only things that
30:26 - it knows how to do with strings it
30:28 - doesn't see these 5s any different than
30:30 - it sees hello and everyone
30:32 - so that's really what string does so if
30:35 - I do string of five plus string of five
30:38 - well what do you think you're going to
30:40 - get do you think you're going to get
30:42 - fifty five the five five or do you think
30:44 - you're going to get ten so think about
30:47 - it for a second okay I hope that you've
30:50 - thought about it or pause the video I'm
30:52 - going to hit enter you're going to get
30:53 - five five of course because you're
30:55 - taking the number five and you've been
30:57 - burning it to a string meaning you're
30:59 - forcefully putting the quotes around it
31:01 - all it does is put two quotes around it
31:04 - okay if you did string of Hello is going
31:07 - to say undefined variable because it
31:09 - doesn't know what Hello is so you have
31:12 - to do it on something that actually
31:13 - exists so like a number a floating
31:17 - number you can do it on but you can't
31:20 - really you know if you did it on the
31:22 - string it wouldn't make much sense so
31:25 - you can use this on everything but you
31:27 - can use it on numbers so it's helpful
31:29 - all right so I've basically explained to
31:33 - you what Len lower/upper and SD are do
31:35 - and now let's let's get started on line
31:38 - one create a variable name pair it and
31:40 - set it to the string Norwegian blue so
31:43 - I'm going to say a parrot is equal to
31:47 - Norwegian blue on line two I'm going to
31:52 - say print so right here I'm going to
32:02 - write lengths parent okay let me ask you
32:06 - and treat these like short interactive
32:09 - quizzes okay just pause the video and
32:11 - think about what the answer would be so
32:13 - what do you think the length of parrot
32:14 - is going to be I'm going to give you
32:16 - five seconds to pause the video and come
32:17 - up with an answer and then I'm going to
32:19 - go ahead and answer it five four three
32:21 - two one is going to be the length of
32:25 - this strength so it's going to be one
32:26 - two three four five six seven eight nine
32:32 - space 10 11 12 13 14 so it's going to
32:37 - return 14 let's try so we got back 14
32:40 - iya right okay cool now let's let's move
32:43 - on now it's going to show us Ryan depth
32:46 - so it's showing us Ryan dot lower and
32:48 - that will just return Ryan so call lower
32:51 - on parrot after print on line 3 and
32:53 - editor so I'm going to say print and I'm
33:01 - going to refer to this string by the
33:04 - word by the variable parrot okay I don't
33:07 - have to write a Norwegian blue again I
33:09 - can just write parent and I can say
33:12 - lower and it's going to return what do
33:14 - you think is going to return and lower
33:15 - take few seconds 5 4 3 2 1 and it's
33:20 - going to return the region blue in all
33:23 - lowercase so all is going to do is
33:25 - change this B to a lowercase and this
33:27 - end to a lowercase and return that so
33:29 - here don't worry about the none all
33:34 - right call upper so upper is pretty much
33:37 - the same thing so I'm going to just do
33:40 - upper here
33:44 - okay cool so that's pretty simple and we
33:49 - got everything in uppercase you guys
33:51 - already have an idea about this declare
33:56 - and assign your variable in line five
33:58 - then call your method on line
34:00 - then on line five so I'm going to
34:02 - declare on line four so I'm going to say
34:04 - create a variable called pi is equal to
34:06 - three point one four and I'm going to
34:09 - print string pi okay and it's going to
34:13 - put quotes around that number that's
34:14 - pretty much what it's doing okay it's
34:16 - not showing you but in my terminal which
34:19 - is better I'd showed you there right
34:21 - it showed you there so if I ran pi is
34:24 - equal to three point one four and it is
34:27 - print string of Pi oh well just trust me
34:36 - guys it's supposed to have it's really
34:39 - it's a string so it has quotes around it
34:41 - okay if I showed it to you you see it
34:44 - has quotes around it but when you print
34:45 - it I forgot it just doesn't put quotes
34:48 - around it but in reality it has quotes
34:50 - around it okay so remember this is not
34:52 - the number 3.14 it's the string 3.14
34:56 - just like a string so you if you did
34:58 - 3.14 plus two
35:00 - you're not going to get you're not going
35:02 - to get three point five point one for
35:04 - which you're going to get is something
35:08 - that doesn't make any sense because it
35:10 - says you cannot concatenate or combine a
35:14 - string and an integer so basically what
35:17 - you're doing is like Hello plus two you
35:19 - can't do that okay that's going to give
35:21 - you an error okay let's take a closer
35:28 - look at why you use Len string and
35:30 - string object but dot notation such as
35:32 - string dot upper for the rest so let's
35:35 - take a closer look down so lion roar Len
35:41 - line line upper okay methods that use
35:45 - dot notation only work with strings on
35:48 - the other hand Len and string can work
35:50 - on other data types so if you have a
35:52 - list of things
35:54 - you know if I had if I showed you a
35:57 - little bit of sneak peek of what's to
35:59 - come ahead if I had a some list okay and
36:05 - this list has a bunch of let's say
36:08 - numbers in it in increasing order X
36:14 - that's what that is
36:15 - well if I did Len of X I will get that
36:18 - there are eight numbers in this list
36:21 - okay so that's what a Len of X is going
36:24 - to do and string of X is just going to
36:29 - put quotes around okay that's all that
36:31 - does okay not very useful okay
36:36 - so on line to recall the Len function
36:39 - with the argument ministry so I can say
36:45 - Len of ministry so once again what do
36:49 - you think it's going to give me if you
36:51 - guess it is going to give me the length
36:53 - of this string here good job that's
36:55 - right
36:56 - line four I'm going to do ministry dot
37:01 - upper and that's gonna basically
37:06 - uppercase the whole string okay the
37:09 - Ministry of Silly Walks twenty seven so
37:13 - the length of this is twenty seven you
37:15 - can count it if you want okay
37:19 - tell python to print monty python to the
37:22 - console online for print and I can just
37:25 - do a Monty Python okay
37:27 - in Python three you have to always use
37:31 - print like this okay so just an FYI if
37:36 - you're if you have Python installed on
37:39 - Python tool you can use the print like
37:41 - this or the other way ordered this way
37:43 - okay all right this was simple enough
37:48 - and now we're doing more printing
37:50 - variables so the Machine goes is going
37:53 - to be our variable and we're going to
37:55 - sign it to the string pain
37:59 - all right and then I'm going to print
38:03 - the Machine goes okay that was pretty
38:12 - simple all right so now they want us to
38:18 - do some string concatenation so remember
38:21 - what I told you
38:22 - hello plus everyone
38:28 - plus say cheers okay what do you think
38:36 - this is going to write I think it's a
38:37 - hello everyone said cheers okay or so it
38:43 - just when you do the plus sign on
38:45 - strings that just concatenate in other
38:48 - words it just puts it together okay
38:50 - that's all that fancy word concatenate
38:52 - means if you don't want to say that's
38:53 - okay but just learn it because the fancy
38:55 - cool word is used very often but it's
38:59 - just saying that you're combining the
39:00 - string so that's what happens when you
39:04 - do the plus sign so here you know you
39:07 - probably have a good feeling what this
39:08 - is going to turn out to be if I did
39:10 - print life of brian so as a matter of
39:14 - fact why don't we do it right there Life
39:16 - of Brian okay let's give it a try print
39:20 - the concatenate string spam and eggs on
39:23 - line three so I'm going to say print and
39:29 - this should not okay so this might work
39:33 - but I'm just going to show you guys the
39:34 - regular way spam and eggs and

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how are you doing so today I'm going to take on a very interesting challenge which is going to be I'm going to go through the entire code Academy course and try to finish it as fast as I can and along the way my goal is to be able to help you guys give you guys some kind of intuition and for most of the people that are stuck this is going to help you kind of get unstuck and think about code um in a little bit of a different way I hope so I hope that this video helps you and it helps you solve those frustrating annoying problems because I remember when I was going through this I didn't have any help and I would quit for weeks at a time because I simply did not know where to go even the forms didn't help me so that's pretty much my main point to help everybody else out there so we're going to be taking the code Academy course here and we're going to be taking in the language called Python and there tons of students enrolled here 2.5 million it's a fairly long long course and the level required is beginner so unit 1 it's syntax tip calculator unit 2 talks about strings date and time and as we get further down we go into more and more useful and more advanced things so conditionals and control flow is going to be fun functions dictionaries and pretty much all of the stuff here battleships is going to be a lot of fun so feel free to use this video as a resource to help you if you get stuck or for entertainment you know just sit through and watch along how I tackle these problems ok so the first one is python is an easy programming language you can use it to create web apps games even a search engine I agree ready to learn Python click Save and submit ok so the first problem is already done all I have to do is hit save and submit code okay max streak of one start next lesson so creating web apps games and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data they do so using variables variable stores a piece of data and gives a specific name for example spam is equal to five so basically here they're teaching you how to store a variable name so what I need to do they gave me the steps to do it right over here so I'm going to say my variable is equal to 10 and that's pretty much all I need to do here so that was very simple set the variables to the values listed in the instructions not a big deal is equal to true B is equal to false and we're done so they're talking about boolean's here boolean values are basically true and false so like they say a light switch you know boom one is on one is off oh my int whoops forgot to add that oh then want me to actually that was just an example so we got to do my n2 is equal to 7 my float equal to one point two three my bool is equals true this should be good all right you've been reassigned so here we're going to try to reassign values so initially my int was seven and then I'm going to change my into three and that's pretty much it for this one sweet okay now we get into functions and functions are fairly cool this code is poorly formatted because every time you write des right you gotta indent four spaces four or more spaces after you write that this is called a function so we wrote a function called spam and what it does is it makes x equals 12 and then it returns so since these instructions they're part of the overall function so these need to be indented right underneath the function let's go ahead and indent this and let's hit submit and this should work okay good white space means right space so in Python remember white space is very important and once again we need to indent all of these otherwise we will get errors a matter of interpretation a window in the top right corner of the page is called interpreter so basically it's that black window the little black window on top right and the interpreter runs your code line by line and checks for any errors so in this example they make a variable called katz and assign it the value 3 so we're supposed to create a variable called spam and set it to true and we're supposed to create a variable called eggs and assign it the value false ok great just to make sure the video is recording okay single line comments and comments or things that are ignored in Python and there are things that are ignored in any programming language so the point of a comment is you're telling the Machine hey don't read this ok read everything else but just don't read anything that has some special symbol next to it telling the machine that it's a comment it's meant to be only read by a human being and the computer has nothing to do with it right so if I said 5 plus 5 the computer might give me back a 10 but if I put as a comment and I did this the computer's not going to give me back anything right if I did this the computer might give me back a syntax error or something right if I if I have semicolons like this but if I did this and made it into a comment the computer is just going to ignore it that's really the point behind behind hashtags their overall comments so it says make sure write a comment on line one make sure it starts with so we can say anything we want right hi I am a very clever programmer okay cool so multiline comments the idea is that I can say stuff like hello how are you doing today five plus five is ten million pretty much I can say anything that I want and this is a multiline comment okay so we're done set count equal the basically the point of a multiline comment is you can just write multi lines and you don't have to put the hashtag over and over and over again it's also useful for documentation later on when you learn what documentation is for now since you're probably learning this language on code Academy and you're watching this video I'm assuming that you don't know what documentation is because you're most likely a beginner but if you're not that's okay too great now let's do some math so in programming languages you can do you can do a lot of math okay there's a lot of the math stuff that you can do which is fun so for example if I opened up my terminal I can I can do I can open a Python and actually let's just do regular Python if I did five plus five I did ten plus ten you know ten times twenty so on and so forth you can do you can do math operations so let's do addition Oh set the variable count to equal the sum of two big numbers okay what does it mean big numbers I don't know 100 plus 200 sure I mean I don't know how big of the numbers of the wanted but I just put some arbitrary numbers 100 and 300 fairly big exponentiation so we're going to learn about how to use the exponent in Python and most of the most of the places you'll see the exponent like this right something raised to the power of some things if I did 2 raised to the power of 2 that's 4 if I did 4 to the raise to the power of 2 that's 16 4 squared and here we're going to do a and we're going to say to a new variable called eggs and use exponent set X is equal to 100 I'm going to do it like this I'm going to say 10 squared right that gives me a hundred so this should run perfectly we got the result 100 we got the little green checkmark at the bottom so let's keep going so now let's talk about the modular operator it's basically the remainder so if you had 10 modulo 2 well what's the remainder if you did 10/2 doesn't to go perfectly into 10 so let's just make this clear and I did 10 divided by 2 I have no leftovers right it goes perfectly to tents if I did 10 modulo 2 I should have a remainder of 0 nothing is left over but if I did 11 divided by 2 well 2 doesn't go perfectly into 11 because 11 is an odd number so if I did 11 remainder of 2 what do you think I'm going to get back to goats perfectly into 10 and then there's one left over so my remainder is going to be if you have guests already it's going to be one okay so that's simply what our remainder is now let me just ask you what do you think the remainder of 99 divided by Manjula is going to be so remember 98 goes perfectly into 98 and then you have one over so you get remainder is going to be one here how about 100 modulo modulo right how about 100 modulo 3 what you get so once again 99 3 is going to go into 99 you get one left over and you're going to get a remainder of 1 so sometimes you want to get the remainder right of whatever you're doing so it's gonna it's a pretty useful operator to have at our disposal because then we can use it fairly easily so here use modulus at spam equal to 1 so once again we did 99 we did 100 modulo 3 and that's going to give us back 1 remember we tested it out so that's how we're going to make spam equal to 1 see use modulus spam equal to 1 you can use any two numbers that will ever mater want to do this cool extra view bringing it all together variables which store values for later data types such as numbers and boolean's so variables are like you know X is equal to 5 y is equal to 2 those are all your variables okay data types are in Python you'll you have you know give numbers you have strings you can have a list you can have a dictionary so once again if you don't know what a list or dictionary is just ignore this so it's not a problem don't worry about it but just remember like 5 and hello those are different kind of data types hello is a string or what if I had a true in here right remember with the word for true and false says source with the B bool ok boolean so true and false they're going to be boolean values whitespace so that's what separates the statements if I had X is equal to 5 and now I'm doing Y is equal to 4 that's separating the statement X 5 and why for you know you can't just do y equals 4 on the same line you got to give it some white space in white space just means blank and blank means something very important in Python so if you did define f of nothing and it says print hello well it's not going to work if you have if you don't have that white space before the print so in Python what white space is very very important in Lang other languages white space doesn't matter you just put squigglies around everything but comments okay comments how can I make this line a comment just add a hashtag before it okay comment my code will run until ignore it it won't give me a syntax or nothing you'll just is just going to ignore and arithmetic operations that's pretty straightforward plus minus sign subtraction addition multiplication of two numbers division exponentiation of two numbers our multiple numbers and then the module operator right the module operator that we played with so it says write a single line comment on line one I'm going to say hello YouTube audience I'm assuming that's how you're watching this video set the variable mod T equal to true and set another variable Python equal to one point two three four and set the third variable Monty Python equal to Python squared right I'm taking this Python and I'm squaring it okay cool so what is the start lesson sure let's start the lesson I mean that's what I'm here for right doing these lessons now let's apply the concepts from the previous section to a realworld example okay so now we're getting to some fun part of the code so you've finished eating a restaurant and receive this bill you'll apply the tip to the overall cost of the meal including tax first let's declare the variable meal and assign it the value of 40 for 50s so here when there's a meal and that is equal to 40 450 the reason why you always see me have spaces here is because that's writing good code that's just trying to make my code cleaner because when it's tightly compacted together like that it's hard for a human to read and it reduces the readability so this is the standard way to do this and it's accepted and it's the convention so you should practice writing good code as you're starting your careers okay so I have this meal and those are all my instructions meal tax is equal to 6.75% another way to write 6.75 is point zero six seven five and because remember 6.75% is really the same thing as six point seven five divided by 100 okay so if I run this code again it's going to work assign the tip variable on line five okay so tip set the variable tip to decimal value of 15% on line five okay so what we're going to do here so the variable tip to decimal value fifteen percent on line five okay so that's the decimal value of 15% wait that's oh ok so they're using Python 2 and here I just want to explain it really quickly so what just happened was you saw me do 15 divided by 100 and then it gave me an error and then I added that little decimal zero afterwards and then all of a sudden it says a way to go click next lesson so I'm going to explain to you why what if those work and why one of the one of them didn't work ok so if I did 15 divided by a hundred in Python 3 I'm going to get a decimal value ok but in Python 2 let me show you what happens ok so let me activate my Python 2 here so I can show you guys what happens and let's say 15 divided by 100 so notice what happened it gave me a 0 that's weird so here's what it does if I did 10 divided by 3 it's going to give me the perfect number of times 3 goes into 10 okay it's not going to give me a decimal value if I want to do that I have to make sure that I'm telling the computer that I'm passing in an integer like a float number a decimal number once I tell it that it knows to give me the exact value but otherwise it'll just tell me how many times some number goes into another number if I did once again hundred divided by three I'm going to get 33 ok I'm not going to get 33 point 3 3 3 whatever I should get if I did 100 divided by 0.3 point 0 then I will get that so what was happening here was when I did 15 divided by a hundred it was like hundred goes zero times into 15 because it's trying to give me a whole number but when I do point 0 now it says 15 divided by 100 and it gives me some small decimal value ok that decimal value will be point zero one five so here if I can show you 15/100 it's going to be 0.15 sorry I meant to 0.15 reassign in a single line okay we've got three variables we need to perform our calculation we know some arithmetic operations that can help us out so we saw in Lesson one we could suspend is equal to 7 then later change your mind and say this like a cool on line 7 assign meal to the value so meal to the value of itself plus itself times tax so pretty much like this ok so no like this okay right no no no I had it correct first all right so here I'm saying if the meal was $44 that's just $44 $44 50 Cent's and then the menial times the tax is the tax you have to pay okay so 44.50 and the tax you have to pay on that is point zero six so this is your tax this is your meal meal plus tax that's the entire amount that you have to pay for your meal okay fairly simple total assign the variable total to the sum of meal plus on line eight now you have the total cost of your meal assign the riddle total to the sum now you have the total cost of your meal I'm confused is really saying do this now I'm saying total is equal to meal plus tip maybe Oh Oh doh okay so it's basically meal plus the tip that we paid on the meal okay so the same logic implies yeah though so meal how much you paid for the meal that's your total okay so the new meal is this whole thing here so this variable here is holding your information for the meal itself and the tax that you paid on it and then this part here is calculating the tip that you paid based on your meal so that's going to be your total this takes into account the money that you paid for your meal it takes into account the tip that you paid based on your on your meal and it takes into account the tax based on your meal okay next strings and console.log I'm going to create a variable called Brian and I'm going to assign it the value hello hello life okay this is called the string string means literally I can put anything I want in there okay it's not going to throw an error it's not going to do anything it's just completely arbitrary and it's just completely madeup whatever you want to put in it that's what a string is okay when you're writing the word document in Python those would be like all it's all every single word in there is you know it's all a string that's what it is because hello life is not a variable it doesn't have any value attached to it but Brian is a variable because if you typed in Brian you would get back hello life cool let's move on so now let's practice let's get a little practice in strings so set Caesar is equal to graham Caesar is equal to Graham and pray line praline and probably sing it wrong equal to John and Viking is equal to Teresa and those are all strings okay and that's pretty much it here the string below is broken fix it using the scape backslash this isn't flying this is a falling with stop so skip backslash what that means is okay look you have you're trying to put this entire thing into a string right you want to put this entire thing with quotes around it so whether you put single quotes or double quotes it doesn't matter but what the main problem is happening here is it's a it's thinking that this apostrophe in isn't it's thinking that it's ending the ending the string so it thinks this part is a string and then it just has no idea what this whole part is right it thinks this whole part if I separated it out it thinks this whole part is just some gibberish and this part is the actual string but what we want is we want the whole thing to be a string so one solution would be I put double quotes here and I put double quotes here but that's not the answer that they want okay they want us to do something that escapes a backslash so this is what we're gonna do okay and what that means is it's saying this is an apostrophe and I don't want you to think of it as a quote okay that's all that does that's Collins you know the term Ford escaping escape backslash okay so you're escaping the quote by putting a backslash there so now the whole thing has turned into a string and that's it okay now we have the string python has six characters number zero to five as shown below all right so now let's try to get the fifth character so I'm going to do how do I get the fifth character so what do I want me to do here fifth letter goes in a blood of string mod T all right so the fifth letter is going to be n here right because that's the fifth letter here weight start cutting right so 0 1 2 3 4 5 oh I see they want us to start counting from here so 1 2 3 4 5 so oh no no I'm wrong it's still N but I just didn't put it in what what is going on so if you wanted Y you could just type this is weird how today how do they want this not sure how they want this oh oh okay I feel I feel feel a little law not good I think for here all right I'm kind of lost this is this is super oh my god they're saying Monty Monty okay Monty all right now remember the reason why so the fifth letter is really the fourth letter because we start from zero so one two three four five but in our case the word was Monty okay and that's what tripped me up so here for us the word is actually Monty so let me actually write that down here and that's that's what it is for us okay okay that's what it is for us that's how we got Monty in the fifth letter ignore the top part that's only an example I constantly was trying to use that okay let's move on string methods okay Len lower/upper string great so these are pretty cool methods you know you can use this one to get a length of a string so let's say you had something like hello my name is Rafa Kazi and I'm a programmer is going to tell you like hey the length of that string is huge that's like a lot of letters in there if you said hello right if I try to get a length so let me let me show you guys these here so if I said a Len of hello well that's five right there five letters in it now let's say I did a hello dot lower what do you think that's going to do that's just going to make Hello all lowercase let's say I had a you know a bunch of capital o whatever letters is going to make it all lower well what do you think the upper upper is going to do you're just going to do the it's going to is simply going to do the opposite of that so if we had you know a bunch of small letters and like this is going to make them all upper case okay so that's really what's going on there okay this doesn't need to be this wide come closer all right cool make sense all right and string what this does is it just converts something to a string so if I had a number like five it's going to give me back a string five okay so like let's say I did five plus five well you can do that but let's say you try to do five plus five you can't you can't add those so what it does is it just add some together just like if you said hello plus everyone okay it's just going to just going to concatenate them so what it did is it added the fives together it's not really looking at them like numbers is just looking at them like strings so it doesn't know that it's an integer type and it can add them together anymore all it can do is concatenate them and do only things that it knows how to do with strings it doesn't see these 5s any different than it sees hello and everyone so that's really what string does so if I do string of five plus string of five well what do you think you're going to get do you think you're going to get fifty five the five five or do you think you're going to get ten so think about it for a second okay I hope that you've thought about it or pause the video I'm going to hit enter you're going to get five five of course because you're taking the number five and you've been burning it to a string meaning you're forcefully putting the quotes around it all it does is put two quotes around it okay if you did string of Hello is going to say undefined variable because it doesn't know what Hello is so you have to do it on something that actually exists so like a number a floating number you can do it on but you can't really you know if you did it on the string it wouldn't make much sense so you can use this on everything but you can use it on numbers so it's helpful all right so I've basically explained to you what Len lower/upper and SD are do and now let's let's get started on line one create a variable name pair it and set it to the string Norwegian blue so I'm going to say a parrot is equal to Norwegian blue on line two I'm going to say print so right here I'm going to write lengths parent okay let me ask you and treat these like short interactive quizzes okay just pause the video and think about what the answer would be so what do you think the length of parrot is going to be I'm going to give you five seconds to pause the video and come up with an answer and then I'm going to go ahead and answer it five four three two one is going to be the length of this strength so it's going to be one two three four five six seven eight nine space 10 11 12 13 14 so it's going to return 14 let's try so we got back 14 iya right okay cool now let's let's move on now it's going to show us Ryan depth so it's showing us Ryan dot lower and that will just return Ryan so call lower on parrot after print on line 3 and editor so I'm going to say print and I'm going to refer to this string by the word by the variable parrot okay I don't have to write a Norwegian blue again I can just write parent and I can say lower and it's going to return what do you think is going to return and lower take few seconds 5 4 3 2 1 and it's going to return the region blue in all lowercase so all is going to do is change this B to a lowercase and this end to a lowercase and return that so here don't worry about the none all right call upper so upper is pretty much the same thing so I'm going to just do upper here okay cool so that's pretty simple and we got everything in uppercase you guys already have an idea about this declare and assign your variable in line five then call your method on line then on line five so I'm going to declare on line four so I'm going to say create a variable called pi is equal to three point one four and I'm going to print string pi okay and it's going to put quotes around that number that's pretty much what it's doing okay it's not showing you but in my terminal which is better I'd showed you there right it showed you there so if I ran pi is equal to three point one four and it is print string of Pi oh well just trust me guys it's supposed to have it's really it's a string so it has quotes around it okay if I showed it to you you see it has quotes around it but when you print it I forgot it just doesn't put quotes around it but in reality it has quotes around it okay so remember this is not the number 3.14 it's the string 3.14 just like a string so you if you did 3.14 plus two you're not going to get you're not going to get three point five point one for which you're going to get is something that doesn't make any sense because it says you cannot concatenate or combine a string and an integer so basically what you're doing is like Hello plus two you can't do that okay that's going to give you an error okay let's take a closer look at why you use Len string and string object but dot notation such as string dot upper for the rest so let's take a closer look down so lion roar Len line line upper okay methods that use dot notation only work with strings on the other hand Len and string can work on other data types so if you have a list of things you know if I had if I showed you a little bit of sneak peek of what's to come ahead if I had a some list okay and this list has a bunch of let's say numbers in it in increasing order X that's what that is well if I did Len of X I will get that there are eight numbers in this list okay so that's what a Len of X is going to do and string of X is just going to put quotes around okay that's all that does okay not very useful okay so on line to recall the Len function with the argument ministry so I can say Len of ministry so once again what do you think it's going to give me if you guess it is going to give me the length of this string here good job that's right line four I'm going to do ministry dot upper and that's gonna basically uppercase the whole string okay the Ministry of Silly Walks twenty seven so the length of this is twenty seven you can count it if you want okay tell python to print monty python to the console online for print and I can just do a Monty Python okay in Python three you have to always use print like this okay so just an FYI if you're if you have Python installed on Python tool you can use the print like this or the other way ordered this way okay all right this was simple enough and now we're doing more printing variables so the Machine goes is going to be our variable and we're going to sign it to the string pain all right and then I'm going to print the Machine goes okay that was pretty simple all right so now they want us to do some string concatenation so remember what I told you hello plus everyone plus say cheers okay what do you think this is going to write I think it's a hello everyone said cheers okay or so it just when you do the plus sign on strings that just concatenate in other words it just puts it together okay that's all that fancy word concatenate means if you don't want to say that's okay but just learn it because the fancy cool word is used very often but it's just saying that you're combining the string so that's what happens when you do the plus sign so here you know you probably have a good feeling what this is going to turn out to be if I did print life of brian so as a matter of fact why don't we do it right there Life of Brian okay let's give it a try print the concatenate string spam and eggs on line three so I'm going to say print and this should not okay so this might work but I'm just going to show you guys the regular way spam and eggs and
