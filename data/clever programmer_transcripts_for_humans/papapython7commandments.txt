00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm also
00:05 - known as Papa Python in this video I
00:09 - want to give you the seven commandments
00:12 - of Python so let's jump right into it
00:16 - man read number one simple is better
00:19 - than complex this is a commandment I
00:22 - stole from Python and this is called the
00:25 - Zen of Python and if you actually put
00:28 - something in your terminal it'll just
00:30 - show it to you okay this is one of the
00:31 - things that python is known for and the
00:35 - people who made it people who are much
00:37 - smarter than I am they actually set that
00:39 - so simple is better than complex but
00:42 - what does that mean when you read that
00:44 - what does it actually mean in your life
00:46 - in your career as a developer what is it
00:50 - okay but when I read it I was just like
00:52 - oh it sounds cool but that's all I
00:54 - understood from it from more of a
00:56 - technical perspective we're to look at
00:58 - it like what it means in the coding
01:00 - world is a lot of the times people will
01:02 - do things a more complex way they'll
01:05 - write functions or they'll write code
01:07 - that is complex they'll write clever
01:11 - one-liners or two liners and three
01:13 - liners instead of writing code that is
01:16 - simple to read that is almost like
01:18 - English the variables that are clear and
01:21 - clean to understand function names that
01:23 - are clean and easy to understand and
01:25 - their code is written in a way where
01:27 - even if it didn't have any documentation
01:30 - it would still be very easy to read and
01:33 - this is very important because when
01:35 - people are trying to hire you they want
01:37 - to see that you are doing stuff thinking
01:40 - of other people or even thinking about
01:42 - yourself because if you write code that
01:45 - looks like gibberish you might
01:46 - understand it for a little bit but you
01:48 - won't understand it two months from now
01:49 - and other people looking at your code
01:52 - sure as hell will not understand it so
01:55 - simple is better than complex is a very
01:57 - important rule to live by
01:59 - number two is focus on building projects
02:04 - this is something I say in almost every
02:06 -  video I know I don't care I'll
02:08 - keep saying it again and again till this
02:11 - point gets hammered
02:13 - home also I just realized I'm wearing a
02:16 - Python shirt so that's actually really
02:18 - cool okay why do I keep saying this
02:20 - point why do I keep saying focus on
02:22 - building real-world projects so much I
02:24 - say this almost every video this is one
02:26 - of the ways you're gonna get hired this
02:28 - is one of the ways where skill is gonna
02:29 - improve the fastest this is one of the
02:31 - ways you're gonna learn coding the
02:33 - fastest on and on and on but if you
02:37 - don't build actual projects you don't
02:40 - build something practical you're never
02:42 - gonna learn coding you're always gonna
02:44 - feel like you have imposter syndrome
02:45 - you're always gonna think you're not
02:47 - good enough and you aren't going to get
02:51 - as many job opportunities as somebody
02:53 - else who is doing lots of practical
02:56 - projects might alright this is one of
02:59 - the reasons why I see people failing
03:01 - quitting out of coding a lot of the
03:04 - times but they all they want to do is
03:05 - follow tutorials follow little programs
03:10 - that other people make copy paste code
03:13 - but when it comes to building something
03:15 - on your own
03:16 - they don't take on something to do you
03:19 - know a project that they want to work on
03:20 - your project doesn't have to be super
03:22 - complex okay you don't have to make the
03:24 - next machine learning algorithm that
03:26 - beats out Instagram and then now your
03:29 - new social media platform is the next
03:31 - snapchat you don't have to do that you
03:33 - can do something really simple you can
03:36 - make a very simple game okay whether you
03:39 - want to make a blackjack game or take
03:41 - tech toe or rock-paper-scissors game or
03:43 - you want to make AG clone or a snapchat
03:45 - little fake clone or a portfolio website
03:48 - whatever it may be it could be some
03:50 - static boring easy website to make do
03:54 - something as you learn to code that's
03:56 - the only way you're gonna take all that
03:58 - knowledge that's in the tutorial that
04:00 - you see you're gonna bring it into real
04:02 - life where it gets internalized and it
04:05 - truly becomes yours where you deeply
04:08 - understand it and nobody can take that
04:10 - away from you now show up when you're an
04:12 - interview it'll come through when people
04:14 - understand ask you those deep questions
04:17 - you'll be able to answer them your
04:19 - github will have giant sexy projects on
04:22 - it which will make you stand out and
04:23 - more than anything you
04:26 - skill level will be improved and last
04:29 - point I want to add to that is work on
04:31 - longer project instead of short many
04:35 - projects like 10 20 30 work on one or
04:38 - two projects that you end up working on
04:41 - for days weeks months maybe even years
04:43 - okay that's gonna be a really good place
04:46 - to be at commandment number three learn
04:51 - negotiation skills and learn soft skills
04:56 - everybody wants to learn how to code
04:59 - everybody wants to become better at
05:01 - coding which is really good but what do
05:03 - you do it for ultimately yes you do it
05:05 - for the satisfaction of problem solving
05:07 - yes you do it for taking something out
05:09 - of your head and turning it into reality
05:11 - but ultimately you are doing it to get
05:15 - paid ultimately you are doing it to
05:18 - survive ultimately you're also doing it
05:21 - so you can actually thrive and take care
05:24 - of not just yourself but hopefully other
05:26 - people around you your family so you
05:29 - have many reasons while you're doing
05:31 - this money being one of the most
05:32 - important yet we never take lessons on
05:38 - learning how to do negotiations and we
05:41 - never take the time to understand how
05:43 - pricing works how to increase our
05:47 - pricing how to increase our hourly rates
05:50 - how to negotiate a higher salary how
05:52 - long does it take should you do counter
05:54 - offers or not what the are even
05:56 - counteroffers and it's a pretty sad
05:58 - thing to think about that people aren't
06:00 - thinking about this because you're
06:02 - putting 40 hours a week you're doing a
06:05 - full-time job and you are most of the
06:08 - times being underpaid and overworked and
06:10 - it's not fair to you it's not fair to
06:12 - your family it's not fair to anybody
06:14 - around you I'll give you a little
06:15 - example let's say you're doing a job and
06:17 - you're making $10 an hour okay the
06:20 - results that you're gonna get out of
06:21 - that in 10 years versus if you were
06:24 - getting paid $20 an hour at the same job
06:26 - okay
06:27 - the results that would take you 10 years
06:29 - to get you can get them in five years
06:31 - over the long term you're essentially
06:34 - doubling that output of your life okay
06:37 - so that's why I mentioned this as
06:40 - very important it'll change the
06:41 - trajectory of your life and that same
06:43 - promote like if you get a job at let's
06:46 - say 50,000 dollars a year as a developer
06:48 - I don't care you know wherever whatever
06:50 - stayed in America or wherever else and
06:52 - you just try to get promoted through
06:55 - your skill from $50,000 a year to like
06:58 - 60 or 70 it's gonna take you five years
07:00 - to do that
07:01 - whereas if you learn how to negotiate
07:03 - and you become better and you understand
07:06 - where you can offer value where these
07:09 - people need it you can actually go from
07:12 - fifty to seventy thousand dollars a year
07:14 - actually a lot quicker and probably even
07:17 - in that first interview where you're
07:20 - about to lock it down okay but you have
07:21 - to deal with the pressure most people
07:23 - are too scared they can't handle
07:26 - the pressure the first job that they get
07:28 - they want to jump on and get into it
07:30 - they feel awkward to feel sleazy and
07:33 - slimy but honestly if you get hired as a
07:38 - developer other people the people who
07:40 - hire you are making literally like
07:42 - twenty thirty times the money that
07:44 - you're making them so don't be stupid
07:47 - please you know do what's fair because
07:49 - fair right on the other side they will
07:53 - say you know we want to give you fair
07:55 - pricing but most of the times they're
07:58 - gonna give you something a lot lower
08:00 - than what you could really be bringing
08:02 - them right so you want to make sure you
08:04 - have that margin in mind and then that
08:07 - you negotiate accordingly point number
08:09 - four learn value-based pricing
08:12 - value-based pricing is an amazing skill
08:15 - set there are many parts to it okay so
08:17 - for example you could build a website
08:19 - for someone that has $0 so they will
08:22 - handle you a lot okay they will come for
08:25 - revisions that will keep calling you
08:27 - they will ask you for all kinds of fixes
08:29 - they will not respect your time nor will
08:31 - they respect you and maybe pay you $300
08:35 - for a two-week long project or you can
08:37 - work with someone who's making a hundred
08:39 - thousand dollars a month from their
08:41 - website you can build him or her a new
08:44 - feature that you get them more customers
08:46 - and then you can charge them ten
08:47 - thousand dollars for a weekend long
08:49 - project okay so what does that mean for
08:52 - example if you work with somebody
08:53 - let's say up-and-coming hair salon they
08:56 - have zero reviews on Yelp they don't
08:58 - make any money they're broke if you try
09:00 - to help them which my friend Tenzin and
09:02 - I did all right
09:04 - many local clients like that when we try
09:06 - to do that they would just haggle us and
09:08 - literally we would spend south of you
09:11 - know probably 30 40 hours working on a
09:13 - project for them and then when we
09:14 - delivered it to them they didn't even
09:16 - pay us $200 it was very depressing but
09:19 - it taught us a very important lesson
09:21 - it wasn't depressing depressing because
09:23 - we just know you have to take else
09:25 - before you can take w's right that was
09:28 - that was not a good feeling but what we
09:30 - learned from it was don't go to people
09:33 - who don't have the money okay because
09:35 - the value up I want to provide to them
09:37 - is gonna be a lot for them but I want to
09:39 - find people where I can get them a huge
09:42 - win and they can also pay me a fat
09:44 - paycheck right so it's a win on both
09:47 - sides so for example if you go to
09:49 - somebody who is killing it in their
09:51 - business but they could use your help
09:54 - and maybe they need your help to
09:56 - integrate a new Jenga feature in their
09:57 - app a Django is a Python web framework
10:01 - so you're using Python there maybe they
10:04 - need a web scraping thing that could
10:06 - ultimately bring them a lot of money or
10:07 - simply put they just need a better
10:09 - website which will then get them a lot
10:11 - more customers so if they're already
10:13 - making like a hundred thousand dollars a
10:15 - month with some of your tweaks if they
10:17 - go up by ten thousand dollars more a
10:20 - month what that really means is that
10:22 - over the course of the year you're
10:24 - making them extra one hundred twenty
10:26 - thousand dollars a year with the service
10:28 - that you provided so if that's the value
10:30 - you're bringing them you could have it
10:32 - in the proposal like look potentially
10:36 - the value I'm bringing you is gonna
10:37 - bring you 120 thousand dollars extra
10:39 - every year that's huge with that said I
10:42 - can get this done it's gonna be awesome
10:44 - but I'm gonna charge you fifteen
10:46 - thousand dollars for it and for that
10:48 - same thing that took us 30 40 hours we
10:51 - could have done this person's project
10:53 - for 30 or 40 hours and we would have
10:56 - walked away with a ten thousand dollar
10:58 - check
10:59 - versus a two hundred dollar check point
11:02 - number five this is the controversial
11:06 - one
11:07 - College one of the reasons why I
11:08 - mentioned quit college
11:10 - is most of the times they're gonna
11:11 - accumulate $60,000 I don't know 20,000
11:16 - dollars of that 40,000 maybe $60,000 a
11:18 - debt with little practical or business
11:21 - skills depending on what it is that you
11:23 - do if you want to be a doctor you have
11:25 - to get a degree very important okay
11:27 - another reason I say this is most of the
11:30 - times when people accumulate debt it
11:32 - takes them five to ten years to actually
11:34 - pay it off it takes them a really long
11:36 - time now that's not very smart it's not
11:39 - very good so what I recommend is if you
11:42 - truly find a way where it's practical
11:46 - for you then yes use college okay I went
11:49 - to college for a long time and it was
11:52 - really valuable for me because it gave
11:53 - me lots of resources but I never taught
11:56 - treated like it was the only resource
11:58 - I used college as it was one of the many
12:01 - resources I never stopped learning on my
12:05 - own so the problem that happens with
12:08 - most people is when they go quit college
12:11 - you mean stop educating yourself what's
12:13 - wrong with you that's not what I mean
12:15 - what I mean is you never stop educating
12:17 - yourself you're always educating
12:19 - yourself it's just more specific to what
12:21 - you're doing instead of that somebody
12:23 - forcing you to go to a chemistry class
12:25 - or somebody forcing you to learn
12:27 - electronic call engineering when really
12:31 - you want to be learning Python data
12:34 - science web development machine learning
12:36 - data mining web scraping or another
12:38 - language like JavaScript doesn't matter
12:41 - what it is that you're trying to do most
12:43 - of the times it's hard to learn those
12:45 - specific things so I personally would
12:48 - rather look online find classes and
12:50 - courses on my own I leverage Udacity
12:54 - Coursera EDX team treehouse code Academy
12:56 - when I was learning all this stuff I
12:59 - used every tool on the planet and made
13:01 - sure that they were vetted and that they
13:03 - were the best because college is the
13:06 - biggest scam on this planet right like
13:08 - for example you know you are watching
13:11 - this video you already know English yet
13:14 - somebody who somebody will they have
13:18 - this degree called the English degree
13:19 - right
13:20 - people can get a degree in the language
13:22 - that you already know here's a piece of
13:25 - paper saying you know this language and
13:26 - I'm gonna charge you $60,000 for it okay
13:29 - it literally doesn't make sense
13:31 - some other things that I think are kind
13:33 - of up with it is how come
13:35 - teachers don't have ratings or reviews
13:36 - and how come a teacher can be terrible
13:39 - but still be teaching that class and
13:40 - still have tenure so there are a lot of
13:42 - like medieval things about colleges and
13:45 - the classical educational system which I
13:48 - do not understand but the reason why I
13:51 - want you to be careful with this advice
13:52 - is take it with a grain of salt most
13:55 - people will make a mistake of dropping
13:57 - out of college without having anything
13:59 - proven to themselves so for example for
14:02 - in my personal life when I dropped out
14:05 - of college it was only after I already
14:08 - had clients with Python I was already
14:10 - making more money
14:12 - hourly than my teacher was and he was
14:14 - asking me for career advice students in
14:17 - the class were taking my free course
14:19 - that I'd put on YouTube to become a
14:22 - better developer I had freelancers who
14:24 - were working for me and we were doing
14:26 - projects together so I already was
14:30 - making close to a six-figure income
14:33 - while I was in college while I was
14:36 - building this YouTube channel so I had
14:38 - lots of backup plans and then I quit
14:42 - college to go all in to the clever
14:45 - programmer business and as well as go
14:48 - harder on the freelancing business on
14:50 - the coaching that I was doing for coding
14:53 - so what I want you to take away from
14:55 - this is don't just go home be like yo
14:58 - guys I'm dropping out think about it and
15:00 - have a plan and then go all-in and if
15:02 - you're not in college just take this
15:04 - advice and apply it to your life maybe
15:06 - you're driving uber right now maybe you
15:09 - are working as a nurse right now maybe
15:12 - you are doing something else and
15:13 - thinking of transitioning into
15:14 - programming so realize how it applies to
15:18 - you realize what needs to be done as
15:19 - long as you have a plan in place and
15:21 - you've proven to yourself you're
15:23 - starting to earn an income from coding
15:25 - then you can actually go all-in
15:27 - so that's very important point number
15:28 - six I'm gonna change it on the fly on my
15:31 - Instagram post it says stop being a
15:32 - little
15:33 - which I do agree with it's a really
15:36 - important point you should look at the
15:38 - Instagram posts I'll hopefully link it
15:40 - in this YouTube video the reason why I
15:42 - say that as most people are just afraid
15:43 - of rejections they're afraid to apply it
15:46 - to as many places as possible because
15:47 - they're gonna get rejected they're
15:49 - afraid of applying for freelancing
15:51 - opportunities because they're afraid
15:53 - they're gonna get rejected so they just
15:55 - keep preparing and preparing they'll get
15:57 - a degree then they'll get a master's
15:58 - degree then they'll get a ph.d degree
16:00 - and they have never really applied or
16:04 - have gotten jobs or have started earning
16:06 - an income and it's purely coming from a
16:08 - place of fear that they can get rejected
16:10 - which is just an illusion cuz you didn't
16:13 - have that job in the first place so you
16:14 - can't really get rejected right so it's
16:17 - just that point but point number six
16:19 - what I actually want to make it in this
16:22 - video is it's so freakin important to
16:26 - make your first one thousand dollars
16:28 - from programming if there's one thing
16:30 - you can focus all your energy on doing
16:33 - is start earning an income from it
16:35 - doesn't matter what you do doesn't
16:37 - matter how you do it but until you start
16:40 - earning an income from it you will not
16:42 - be able to commit to it like all in
16:44 - you'll not be able to go 100% you won't
16:46 - be able to improve it the speed that
16:47 - you're supposed to improve that you will
16:49 - not get the results you want and
16:51 - sometimes you can get discouraged and
16:53 - quit programming altogether but if
16:56 - you're getting paid to do it not only
16:59 - are you having fun and it's awesome but
17:02 - you're gonna be just learning so much
17:04 - faster because that's what you're being
17:05 - paid to do alright that's when I made my
17:08 - biggest revelations and now you're
17:10 - taking code a lot more seriously and
17:13 - your projects a lot more seriously there
17:14 - aren't just baby projects anymore know
17:18 - number seven what I'm gonna say is give
17:21 - value okay so what does that mean stop
17:24 - thinking about yourself look for
17:25 - problems in the world and they don't
17:28 - have to be unique problems just problems
17:31 - but you need to go out there and solve
17:33 - them okay so if you are looking to apply
17:36 - on up work and you see bunch of Python
17:38 - project so you can solve look for the
17:41 - problems that need to be solved maybe a
17:43 - lot of people are needing help with web
17:45 - testing selenium
17:47 - they're looking for help in somebody who
17:51 - can do web scraping for them maybe they
17:54 - need to make this little bot that can
17:56 - web scrape Craigslist and pull out stuff
17:58 - and then show it to you whatever it may
18:01 - be actually look for the problems look
18:04 - for what people want solve because
18:06 - that's what people will pay you for
18:08 - right people will pay you to solve their
18:11 - problems
18:12 - so look them up understand them at a
18:14 - deeper level and once you discover
18:16 - certain problems then you can actually
18:17 - go and learn them so for example instead
18:19 - of just learning about something totally
18:21 - random wouldn't it be cool if you kept
18:24 - finding online on platforms like up work
18:27 - people always kept saying they needed
18:29 - help in web scraping so you keep going
18:32 - man I see web scraping a lot I see lots
18:34 - of jobs for it I look to see lots of job
18:36 - postings for it
18:37 - let me start learning it and then you
18:39 - learn web scraping and you learned it
18:41 - enough in a month where you start
18:43 - applying to these jobs and the same
18:44 - people that weren't hiring you are now
18:46 - hiring you and you're doing this project
18:49 - for them and who cares if they're paying
18:51 - you $50 $100 if this is one of your
18:53 - first projects this is amazing you know
18:56 - this is a concept of not every dollar is
18:58 - equal so you could make $50 using uber
19:00 - or you can make $50 from coding but
19:02 - which is more in line with your ultimate
19:05 - goal okay so that's what I mean by give
19:07 - value find problems and you'll be able
19:10 - to find exactly where you can give value
19:13 - and then you can learn that thing and
19:15 - that's gonna be your most practical way
19:17 - of learning and earning at the same time
19:20 - okay so those were my seven commandments
19:24 - those were pop up I thought Commandments
19:26 - I hope that they were valuable for you
19:29 - and let me know in the comments below
19:32 - which one was your favorite one I had a
19:35 - lot of fun making this video it's
19:36 - actually 3 a.m. I'm dead tired so that's
19:39 - why you feel my energy be a little bit
19:41 - different but I wanted to make this
19:42 - video for you and I hope you enjoyed it
19:45 - with that said I do want to let you know
19:47 - that I have a new program called earn 1k
19:50 - with Python and that program is coming
19:54 - out if it's not out already it's going
19:56 - to be in the description below and the
19:58 - whole point of that program is to get
20:00 - you to
20:01 - earn your first $1,000 from coding and
20:04 - from Python because I realized that's
20:06 - the ultimate secret to improving because
20:10 - if you start earning an income you will
20:13 - take it more seriously you will become
20:16 - better faster than ever and it's like
20:20 - almost your nervous system now starts
20:22 - taking it seriously okay and it's fun
20:24 - so with that set I hope you go to that
20:27 - link put in your email alright so just
20:29 - do that now and as soon as this course
20:32 - is open I will let you know as well as I
20:35 - will send you a three-part epic master
20:38 - class that's absolutely free it's gonna
20:40 - blow your mind it's filled with
20:42 - value and yep that's it so thank you so
20:45 - much for watching this video as always I
20:47 - love your face and I'll see you in the
20:50 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm also known as Papa Python in this video I want to give you the seven commandments of Python so let's jump right into it man read number one simple is better than complex this is a commandment I stole from Python and this is called the Zen of Python and if you actually put something in your terminal it'll just show it to you okay this is one of the things that python is known for and the people who made it people who are much smarter than I am they actually set that so simple is better than complex but what does that mean when you read that what does it actually mean in your life in your career as a developer what is it okay but when I read it I was just like oh it sounds cool but that's all I understood from it from more of a technical perspective we're to look at it like what it means in the coding world is a lot of the times people will do things a more complex way they'll write functions or they'll write code that is complex they'll write clever oneliners or two liners and three liners instead of writing code that is simple to read that is almost like English the variables that are clear and clean to understand function names that are clean and easy to understand and their code is written in a way where even if it didn't have any documentation it would still be very easy to read and this is very important because when people are trying to hire you they want to see that you are doing stuff thinking of other people or even thinking about yourself because if you write code that looks like gibberish you might understand it for a little bit but you won't understand it two months from now and other people looking at your code sure as hell will not understand it so simple is better than complex is a very important rule to live by number two is focus on building projects this is something I say in almost every video I know I don't care I'll keep saying it again and again till this point gets hammered home also I just realized I'm wearing a Python shirt so that's actually really cool okay why do I keep saying this point why do I keep saying focus on building realworld projects so much I say this almost every video this is one of the ways you're gonna get hired this is one of the ways where skill is gonna improve the fastest this is one of the ways you're gonna learn coding the fastest on and on and on but if you don't build actual projects you don't build something practical you're never gonna learn coding you're always gonna feel like you have imposter syndrome you're always gonna think you're not good enough and you aren't going to get as many job opportunities as somebody else who is doing lots of practical projects might alright this is one of the reasons why I see people failing quitting out of coding a lot of the times but they all they want to do is follow tutorials follow little programs that other people make copy paste code but when it comes to building something on your own they don't take on something to do you know a project that they want to work on your project doesn't have to be super complex okay you don't have to make the next machine learning algorithm that beats out Instagram and then now your new social media platform is the next snapchat you don't have to do that you can do something really simple you can make a very simple game okay whether you want to make a blackjack game or take tech toe or rockpaperscissors game or you want to make AG clone or a snapchat little fake clone or a portfolio website whatever it may be it could be some static boring easy website to make do something as you learn to code that's the only way you're gonna take all that knowledge that's in the tutorial that you see you're gonna bring it into real life where it gets internalized and it truly becomes yours where you deeply understand it and nobody can take that away from you now show up when you're an interview it'll come through when people understand ask you those deep questions you'll be able to answer them your github will have giant sexy projects on it which will make you stand out and more than anything you skill level will be improved and last point I want to add to that is work on longer project instead of short many projects like 10 20 30 work on one or two projects that you end up working on for days weeks months maybe even years okay that's gonna be a really good place to be at commandment number three learn negotiation skills and learn soft skills everybody wants to learn how to code everybody wants to become better at coding which is really good but what do you do it for ultimately yes you do it for the satisfaction of problem solving yes you do it for taking something out of your head and turning it into reality but ultimately you are doing it to get paid ultimately you are doing it to survive ultimately you're also doing it so you can actually thrive and take care of not just yourself but hopefully other people around you your family so you have many reasons while you're doing this money being one of the most important yet we never take lessons on learning how to do negotiations and we never take the time to understand how pricing works how to increase our pricing how to increase our hourly rates how to negotiate a higher salary how long does it take should you do counter offers or not what the are even counteroffers and it's a pretty sad thing to think about that people aren't thinking about this because you're putting 40 hours a week you're doing a fulltime job and you are most of the times being underpaid and overworked and it's not fair to you it's not fair to your family it's not fair to anybody around you I'll give you a little example let's say you're doing a job and you're making $10 an hour okay the results that you're gonna get out of that in 10 years versus if you were getting paid $20 an hour at the same job okay the results that would take you 10 years to get you can get them in five years over the long term you're essentially doubling that output of your life okay so that's why I mentioned this as very important it'll change the trajectory of your life and that same promote like if you get a job at let's say 50,000 dollars a year as a developer I don't care you know wherever whatever stayed in America or wherever else and you just try to get promoted through your skill from $50,000 a year to like 60 or 70 it's gonna take you five years to do that whereas if you learn how to negotiate and you become better and you understand where you can offer value where these people need it you can actually go from fifty to seventy thousand dollars a year actually a lot quicker and probably even in that first interview where you're about to lock it down okay but you have to deal with the pressure most people are too scared they can't handle the pressure the first job that they get they want to jump on and get into it they feel awkward to feel sleazy and slimy but honestly if you get hired as a developer other people the people who hire you are making literally like twenty thirty times the money that you're making them so don't be stupid please you know do what's fair because fair right on the other side they will say you know we want to give you fair pricing but most of the times they're gonna give you something a lot lower than what you could really be bringing them right so you want to make sure you have that margin in mind and then that you negotiate accordingly point number four learn valuebased pricing valuebased pricing is an amazing skill set there are many parts to it okay so for example you could build a website for someone that has $0 so they will handle you a lot okay they will come for revisions that will keep calling you they will ask you for all kinds of fixes they will not respect your time nor will they respect you and maybe pay you $300 for a twoweek long project or you can work with someone who's making a hundred thousand dollars a month from their website you can build him or her a new feature that you get them more customers and then you can charge them ten thousand dollars for a weekend long project okay so what does that mean for example if you work with somebody let's say upandcoming hair salon they have zero reviews on Yelp they don't make any money they're broke if you try to help them which my friend Tenzin and I did all right many local clients like that when we try to do that they would just haggle us and literally we would spend south of you know probably 30 40 hours working on a project for them and then when we delivered it to them they didn't even pay us $200 it was very depressing but it taught us a very important lesson it wasn't depressing depressing because we just know you have to take else before you can take w's right that was that was not a good feeling but what we learned from it was don't go to people who don't have the money okay because the value up I want to provide to them is gonna be a lot for them but I want to find people where I can get them a huge win and they can also pay me a fat paycheck right so it's a win on both sides so for example if you go to somebody who is killing it in their business but they could use your help and maybe they need your help to integrate a new Jenga feature in their app a Django is a Python web framework so you're using Python there maybe they need a web scraping thing that could ultimately bring them a lot of money or simply put they just need a better website which will then get them a lot more customers so if they're already making like a hundred thousand dollars a month with some of your tweaks if they go up by ten thousand dollars more a month what that really means is that over the course of the year you're making them extra one hundred twenty thousand dollars a year with the service that you provided so if that's the value you're bringing them you could have it in the proposal like look potentially the value I'm bringing you is gonna bring you 120 thousand dollars extra every year that's huge with that said I can get this done it's gonna be awesome but I'm gonna charge you fifteen thousand dollars for it and for that same thing that took us 30 40 hours we could have done this person's project for 30 or 40 hours and we would have walked away with a ten thousand dollar check versus a two hundred dollar check point number five this is the controversial one College one of the reasons why I mentioned quit college is most of the times they're gonna accumulate $60,000 I don't know 20,000 dollars of that 40,000 maybe $60,000 a debt with little practical or business skills depending on what it is that you do if you want to be a doctor you have to get a degree very important okay another reason I say this is most of the times when people accumulate debt it takes them five to ten years to actually pay it off it takes them a really long time now that's not very smart it's not very good so what I recommend is if you truly find a way where it's practical for you then yes use college okay I went to college for a long time and it was really valuable for me because it gave me lots of resources but I never taught treated like it was the only resource I used college as it was one of the many resources I never stopped learning on my own so the problem that happens with most people is when they go quit college you mean stop educating yourself what's wrong with you that's not what I mean what I mean is you never stop educating yourself you're always educating yourself it's just more specific to what you're doing instead of that somebody forcing you to go to a chemistry class or somebody forcing you to learn electronic call engineering when really you want to be learning Python data science web development machine learning data mining web scraping or another language like JavaScript doesn't matter what it is that you're trying to do most of the times it's hard to learn those specific things so I personally would rather look online find classes and courses on my own I leverage Udacity Coursera EDX team treehouse code Academy when I was learning all this stuff I used every tool on the planet and made sure that they were vetted and that they were the best because college is the biggest scam on this planet right like for example you know you are watching this video you already know English yet somebody who somebody will they have this degree called the English degree right people can get a degree in the language that you already know here's a piece of paper saying you know this language and I'm gonna charge you $60,000 for it okay it literally doesn't make sense some other things that I think are kind of up with it is how come teachers don't have ratings or reviews and how come a teacher can be terrible but still be teaching that class and still have tenure so there are a lot of like medieval things about colleges and the classical educational system which I do not understand but the reason why I want you to be careful with this advice is take it with a grain of salt most people will make a mistake of dropping out of college without having anything proven to themselves so for example for in my personal life when I dropped out of college it was only after I already had clients with Python I was already making more money hourly than my teacher was and he was asking me for career advice students in the class were taking my free course that I'd put on YouTube to become a better developer I had freelancers who were working for me and we were doing projects together so I already was making close to a sixfigure income while I was in college while I was building this YouTube channel so I had lots of backup plans and then I quit college to go all in to the clever programmer business and as well as go harder on the freelancing business on the coaching that I was doing for coding so what I want you to take away from this is don't just go home be like yo guys I'm dropping out think about it and have a plan and then go allin and if you're not in college just take this advice and apply it to your life maybe you're driving uber right now maybe you are working as a nurse right now maybe you are doing something else and thinking of transitioning into programming so realize how it applies to you realize what needs to be done as long as you have a plan in place and you've proven to yourself you're starting to earn an income from coding then you can actually go allin so that's very important point number six I'm gonna change it on the fly on my Instagram post it says stop being a little which I do agree with it's a really important point you should look at the Instagram posts I'll hopefully link it in this YouTube video the reason why I say that as most people are just afraid of rejections they're afraid to apply it to as many places as possible because they're gonna get rejected they're afraid of applying for freelancing opportunities because they're afraid they're gonna get rejected so they just keep preparing and preparing they'll get a degree then they'll get a master's degree then they'll get a ph.d degree and they have never really applied or have gotten jobs or have started earning an income and it's purely coming from a place of fear that they can get rejected which is just an illusion cuz you didn't have that job in the first place so you can't really get rejected right so it's just that point but point number six what I actually want to make it in this video is it's so freakin important to make your first one thousand dollars from programming if there's one thing you can focus all your energy on doing is start earning an income from it doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter how you do it but until you start earning an income from it you will not be able to commit to it like all in you'll not be able to go 100% you won't be able to improve it the speed that you're supposed to improve that you will not get the results you want and sometimes you can get discouraged and quit programming altogether but if you're getting paid to do it not only are you having fun and it's awesome but you're gonna be just learning so much faster because that's what you're being paid to do alright that's when I made my biggest revelations and now you're taking code a lot more seriously and your projects a lot more seriously there aren't just baby projects anymore know number seven what I'm gonna say is give value okay so what does that mean stop thinking about yourself look for problems in the world and they don't have to be unique problems just problems but you need to go out there and solve them okay so if you are looking to apply on up work and you see bunch of Python project so you can solve look for the problems that need to be solved maybe a lot of people are needing help with web testing selenium they're looking for help in somebody who can do web scraping for them maybe they need to make this little bot that can web scrape Craigslist and pull out stuff and then show it to you whatever it may be actually look for the problems look for what people want solve because that's what people will pay you for right people will pay you to solve their problems so look them up understand them at a deeper level and once you discover certain problems then you can actually go and learn them so for example instead of just learning about something totally random wouldn't it be cool if you kept finding online on platforms like up work people always kept saying they needed help in web scraping so you keep going man I see web scraping a lot I see lots of jobs for it I look to see lots of job postings for it let me start learning it and then you learn web scraping and you learned it enough in a month where you start applying to these jobs and the same people that weren't hiring you are now hiring you and you're doing this project for them and who cares if they're paying you $50 $100 if this is one of your first projects this is amazing you know this is a concept of not every dollar is equal so you could make $50 using uber or you can make $50 from coding but which is more in line with your ultimate goal okay so that's what I mean by give value find problems and you'll be able to find exactly where you can give value and then you can learn that thing and that's gonna be your most practical way of learning and earning at the same time okay so those were my seven commandments those were pop up I thought Commandments I hope that they were valuable for you and let me know in the comments below which one was your favorite one I had a lot of fun making this video it's actually 3 a.m. I'm dead tired so that's why you feel my energy be a little bit different but I wanted to make this video for you and I hope you enjoyed it with that said I do want to let you know that I have a new program called earn 1k with Python and that program is coming out if it's not out already it's going to be in the description below and the whole point of that program is to get you to earn your first $1,000 from coding and from Python because I realized that's the ultimate secret to improving because if you start earning an income you will take it more seriously you will become better faster than ever and it's like almost your nervous system now starts taking it seriously okay and it's fun so with that set I hope you go to that link put in your email alright so just do that now and as soon as this course is open I will let you know as well as I will send you a threepart epic master class that's absolutely free it's gonna blow your mind it's filled with value and yep that's it so thank you so much for watching this video as always I love your face and I'll see you in the next video
