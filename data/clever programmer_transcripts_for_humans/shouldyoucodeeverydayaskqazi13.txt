00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm one
00:05 - of the questions that I get a lot should
00:07 - i code every day so without any further
00:10 - ado let's jump right into it
00:13 - [Music]
00:22 - [Applause]
00:23 - so this question of should i code
00:26 - everyday and what is the best
00:28 - consistency to code with okay this is
00:32 - something that is really based on I'm
00:35 - gonna answer it in a few different ways
00:36 - okay but one of the ways that I'm gonna
00:38 - answer it as well is this is really
00:40 - based on your personality type okay what
00:43 - kind of personality do you have I read
00:46 - this incredible blog post by Steve
00:50 - Pavlina
00:51 - and the blog post is on Bursar's versus
00:54 - plotters okay so there are a few people
00:57 - that are really good at that quick start
01:00 - let's just get going
01:02 - thing okay which is like they have a new
01:05 - idea and they just want to go and spend
01:07 - like 10 hours on in 20 20 hours on and
01:09 - just do it at once okay but then they
01:12 - don't want to be consistent over time so
01:14 - example of these people is like they
01:16 - like to start new things they might want
01:18 - to start on a new diet and they might
01:21 - actually make that change happen but
01:23 - they won't stick with it for over a long
01:25 - period of time okay and bursters are
01:27 - like quick starters they'll start things
01:29 - really fast I am a burster now plotters
01:32 - on the other hand are people who are
01:34 - very good at just plodding along so the
01:37 - con of that is that you will get stuck
01:40 - into something that you probably don't
01:42 - even want to do and you might just do
01:44 - this nine-to-five job for the rest of
01:45 - your life or if you get out of it and
01:47 - you actually develop a good habit like
01:49 - going to the gym or producing a YouTube
01:52 - video or writing a coding tutorial or
01:56 - working on a coding problem you will
01:58 - just keep doing that for a long time
01:59 - okay so one thing is kind of
02:01 - understanding your personality type and
02:03 - the reason why this plays an important
02:05 - part in should you code everyday is
02:07 - because it will allow you to determine
02:12 - which type of person you are and the
02:13 - answer of this question is going to be
02:15 - based on your personality type so if you
02:17 - are somebody who likes to just go all-in
02:19 - then what you should do is and what I
02:22 - did I wasn't coding necessarily every
02:25 - single day for like one hour what I was
02:28 - doing mostly was like I would code you
02:31 - know let's
02:32 - on a Friday Saturday and Sunday but just
02:34 - go all in like 10 15 hour days and that
02:39 - way I went a lot deeper into what I did
02:42 - and I develop deeper projects rather
02:44 - than these like shallow one hour a day
02:48 - projects because my brain it works in a
02:51 - really weird way and I don't know if
02:53 - this is true for you as well but I'm
02:55 - kind of slow to start so if I have to do
02:58 - work on some coding project right for
03:01 - the first one or two hours my brain is
03:03 - kind of foggy its distracted I'm like
03:05 - thinking about responding to somebody or
03:07 - a text message or I'm like oh what about
03:10 - that article or maybe I should go on
03:11 - YouTube and my brain is kind of all over
03:13 - the place and one two three hours then
03:15 - actually zone it and then from the third
03:18 - hour mark you know I'm like tapped in
03:20 - for a very long period of time
03:22 - I can go for 10-15 hours in a row
03:24 - without a problem okay but I also know
03:27 - people who can do who can just jump into
03:29 - something and just give it Bluto focus
03:32 - for one hour so if you are that type of
03:35 - person who would rather not sit and do
03:37 - something for 10 to 15 hours at a time
03:39 - then you should add focus coding blocks
03:42 - for one hour every day you know one hour
03:45 - or two hours every day and you're gonna
03:48 - make great progress but if you're
03:50 - somebody like me who's kind of like slow
03:52 - slash a bursar and likes to just do
03:54 - everything at once then what's gonna be
03:57 - best for you is not coding every day
04:01 - unless you want to of course but rather
04:04 - coding and just going all-in okay and
04:09 - what that's gonna allow you to do is do
04:11 - a lot of deep work and if you read this
04:15 - book by Cal Newport on deep work it
04:19 - talks about you know once you're tapped
04:21 - into something and you're deeply engaged
04:24 - with that meaning like you don't have
04:25 - your cell phone on there no distractions
04:27 - the level of your thinking your thinking
04:29 - at a really high level okay with the
04:34 - complexity with which your brain can
04:35 - think and the speed that it can process
04:37 - that is a lot stronger when you are just
04:41 - really focused for a while and you're
04:43 - working on a project that you know
04:45 - you're spending 10 or 20 hours on rather
04:48 - than just like doing a little bit every
04:51 - single day so I'm gonna leave you with
04:56 - this okay based on your personality type
05:00 - if you're a plotter stick to focus
05:05 - coding blocks if you're a bursar go on
05:09 - long Sprint's of coding okay that's it
05:13 - for this video thank you so much for
05:15 - watching if you have a question put it
05:18 - in the comment section below
05:20 - we will jump in and help you out okay
