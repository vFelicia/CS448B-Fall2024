01:48 - get started with today's training so
01:50 - here we go you're a road map to becoming
01:52 - a friend and developer in 90 days first
01:54 - of all who here wants to become a
01:56 - front-end developer in the next 90 days
01:58 - either raise your hands or drop it in
01:59 - the comments so i can see it
02:01 - i'm really curious guys come on come on
02:02 - come on seeing lots of hands go up fabio
02:05 - anthony nice
02:07 - david zachary beautiful
02:09 - guys this is what we do at clever
02:11 - programmer okay over 5000 students are
02:14 - learning from us and have gotten
02:15 - incredible results we have students that
02:17 - have gotten jobs at companies like
02:18 - spotify amazon sonos microsoft disney
02:21 - paypal blue origin youtube google
02:24 - facebook and the list goes on are there
02:26 - any companies here that you guys would
02:28 - be excited to work for if yes give me
02:31 - put your hands up or just say i in the
02:33 - chat or somewhere so we can see it
02:36 - okay
02:37 - i'm really curious what company would
02:38 - you want to work for if it's not on here
02:40 - what come with your work i'm really
02:41 - curious to see fair enough drop that in
02:43 - the chat as well so we can see it apple
02:45 - yep google apple tesla nice
02:49 - i want to work for clever programmer
02:51 - pedro nice okay
02:53 - beautiful
02:54 - um
02:55 - so guys on youtube we have officially
02:58 - hit over 1 million subscribers which is
03:00 - kind of crazy to say that
03:03 - but we finally hit that goal
03:05 - um and you know
03:07 - we are over in 200 countries with our
03:09 - online state-of-the-art education
03:10 - program so just want to say thank you
03:12 - guys so much for all the love and the
03:14 - support
03:15 - um
03:16 - can we get that on mute please oh hold
03:18 - on hold on okay
03:21 - that got really loud okay yeah yeah okay
03:24 - did you admit yourself by the way
03:27 - make sure you i mean yourself yep i'm
03:28 - good okay
03:30 - so according to glassdoor like we showed
03:32 - you guys this is how much a front-end
03:33 - developer makes
03:35 - on indeed there are tons of job openings
03:37 - available as you guys know and we've
03:38 - shown you guys the bs everybody shows
03:40 - you when it comes to front-end developer
03:42 - or becoming a full-stack developer but
03:44 - it's just not true you need to know a
03:45 - few things so here's what we say instead
03:48 - we said the technologies you need to
03:50 - know to become a front-end developer
03:52 - are html css javascript
03:55 - and then the next thing that you need to
03:57 - master is really algorithms and data
03:59 - structures and that's really interesting
04:02 - why why did i structure algorithms i'm
04:03 - curious because it's so freaking
04:05 - important to know these at a deep level
04:07 - because look at this your fancy projects
04:11 - will get you the interviews and then
04:13 - algorithms and data structures and your
04:14 - problem solving skills will actually
04:16 - help you land the job
04:18 - it is your foundations guys right it's
04:20 - like whenever you build a house guys
04:21 - definition that you got right that's the
04:23 - platform if you got a bad foundation
04:25 - that house what happens to the house it
04:27 - falls down yeah we don't want that so we
04:29 - want to have those down really really
04:31 - solid yup
04:32 - that's exactly right and that's why we
04:34 - say going slow is fast the reason why we
04:37 - said going slow is fast can you guys
04:39 - tell us in the chat why you think we
04:41 - might still going slow as fast okay
04:43 - now here's what i'm going to say going
04:45 - slow is fast and that's our slogan
04:48 - because
04:48 - people want to learn all the fanciest
04:51 - frameworks you want to learn next you
04:52 - want to learn like the hottest things
04:54 - you want to learn react and all of that
04:56 - stuff is really really good but if your
04:58 - foundation is weak everything is going
05:00 - to come crumbling down if you actually
05:02 - work on problem solving and you just
05:03 - learn things like javascript really well
05:05 - and really deeply and then you learn
05:07 - react
05:08 - then your skills are really strong and
05:11 - so you might be slow in the start but
05:12 - you actually become a much better
05:14 - developer over time okay exactly what
05:17 - you call this is like you prevent
05:18 - yourself from being a pinball machine
05:19 - right you probably raise your hand here
05:21 - or probably if you're in the comments on
05:23 - youtube let us know in the comments if
05:25 - you've been situation where like every
05:27 - single thing you knew you see you want
05:28 - to do that thing right you go from one
05:30 - technology to another technology to
05:32 - another technology and then you just
05:33 - feel like you're not getting anywhere
05:35 - raise your hand if you feel like that
05:36 - i'm really curious raise your hand up
05:38 - high up high raise your hands if you
05:40 - think you've ever been stuck in tutorial
05:42 - hell where you just go from tutorial
05:43 - tutorial and it doesn't make sense and
05:46 - you get stuck i see tons of hands going
05:48 - up right this is exactly the problem and
05:51 - so now we're going to start giving you
05:52 - the things that you need to master so
05:54 - start writing these down
05:56 - you need to actually master react
05:59 - okay
06:00 - react is going to be a very fundamental
06:02 - key component in you becoming a
06:04 - front-end developer especially if you
06:06 - want to become a react developer okay
06:08 - master this before you move on to things
06:10 - like next or something else
06:12 - yeah and again that's because right
06:15 - these are the core principles right
06:16 - companies will look at you what you know
06:18 - in terms of javascript html css but in
06:20 - order to build large scale applications
06:22 - like we're talking facebook netflix all
06:24 - these other ones then you do have to you
06:26 - know learn technologies like react
06:28 - absolutely
06:30 - learn a state management tool like redux
06:32 - so write the word down state management
06:35 - okay
06:36 - and then you can learn anything
06:37 - underneath the state management umbrella
06:40 - you can learn context api you can learn
06:42 - redux you can learn whatever else is out
06:44 - there but redux is one of the most
06:46 - valuable ones because a ton of companies
06:49 - use it and tons of projects hundreds of
06:52 - thousands of projects depend on redux
06:55 - and a simple way to describe to you what
06:57 - redux is have you ever used an app like
07:00 - let's say instacart or maybe even amazon
07:02 - or something else and you go and you
07:04 - order food right when you're about to go
07:06 - order food and you add it to your cart
07:08 - well
07:09 - nothing refreshes yet it adds things to
07:12 - your cart and if you go back and forth
07:14 - between multiple pages your cart still
07:16 - remembers where you left off right how
07:18 - is that happening and all lightning fast
07:20 - and your car remembers it
07:22 - that's where redux kicks in it's
07:24 - actually managing the state have you
07:25 - ever gone to a website where you hit a
07:27 - toggle button and all of a sudden goes
07:29 - from bright screen to a dark screen
07:31 - that's also state management and redux
07:33 - is at play there
07:35 - even for example you go on facebook guys
07:37 - you go on facebook you log in with your
07:38 - facebook account and then you exit
07:40 - facebook but then you come back it's
07:42 - still there right it'd be a really bad
07:44 - experience if you every time you go to
07:46 - the browser you go to facebook.com and
07:48 - you always have to log in like i never
07:50 - remember a password right yeah so you
07:52 - don't want to do that either so that's
07:54 - why remember redux remember state
07:56 - management very valuable next up is git
07:59 - version control which is like we've told
08:01 - you already so we're not going to go too
08:03 - deep into it but this is your time
08:04 - machine for your uh code and github is
08:08 - where your code goes to live so this is
08:09 - just a little bit of refresher from what
08:11 - we did on day one now firebase is going
08:13 - to be where your data is stored plus you
08:16 - can actually allow users to be
08:17 - authenticated so make sure that you have
08:19 - firebase under your belt because it's a
08:22 - very good real-time database to learn in
08:24 - combination with react
08:26 - exactly and so if you want to build like
08:27 - applications like whatsapp messenger to
08:29 - have like a live messaging you ever
08:30 - wonder how that happens yeah exactly
08:33 - firebase allows you to do that
08:36 - yes absolutely
08:38 - uh now let's break down your journey
08:41 - into next into 12 weeks how you can
08:44 - actually go step by step in next 12
08:45 - weeks and learn these
08:47 - skills all right so week number one
08:50 - here's what you can write down on your
08:51 - roadmap to do
08:53 - just practice and learn html and css
08:56 - okay
08:57 - and build a portfolio website using html
09:00 - and css so make that your first week's
09:02 - mission all right this is very doable
09:05 - and you can make a you know portfolio
09:07 - that looks like this or you can model
09:09 - something that looks good you know
09:11 - something that you like but you can take
09:13 - a screenshot of this right now if you
09:15 - want because this can be a really good
09:16 - portfolio project for you to do okay i'm
09:19 - going to give you guys five seconds to
09:20 - take a screenshot of this five
09:22 - four three two one
09:26 - okay mark winters i'm going to read his
09:27 - comments my main reason honestly for
09:29 - switching was because there isn't as
09:30 - much enthusiasm in other languages you
09:32 - guys are in fire and make react
09:34 - interesting awesome thank you yup
09:37 - um
09:38 - cool all right moving on this design is
09:40 - from dribbble.com and dribble with three
09:43 - b's cool yeah and if you know by the way
09:45 - by the way guys if you want to find some
09:47 - really good uh you know portfolio
09:49 - websites where where you know where to
09:51 - get them like joe.com is a good not a
09:52 - good one the fundamentals was a really
09:54 - good one as well another uh good website
09:56 - you can see absolutely portfolio
09:58 - building just copy them you just like
10:00 - copy them slash you know build on top of
10:03 - them yeah exactly now learning the
10:05 - fundamentals of javascript is going to
10:07 - be your week two all right that's what
10:09 - we're moving on to week two so write
10:10 - this down learn the fundamentals of
10:13 - javascript so when we say fundamentals
10:16 - these are like the core for example
10:19 - you know what's a variable uh how do you
10:22 - add two numbers together
10:25 - what happens what's a string what's an
10:27 - array what's a object how do you write a
10:32 - loop how do you write a for loop how do
10:34 - you write a while loop what's an if else
10:36 - condition all these things are the
10:38 - fundamental building blocks of
10:40 - javascript and most computer science and
10:42 - programming languages so you need to
10:44 - understand them really well before you
10:47 - start going to more advanced things even
10:48 - if that's react okay that's that comes
10:50 - later and i think it's very important
10:52 - because like you know a lot of students
10:54 - tell me a lot of people told me hey nas
10:56 - i know html no css i'm a developer now
10:58 - this is easy stuff i'm like oh
11:01 - you haven't gone to the real stuff yet
11:02 - right so like raise your hand i'm really
11:04 - curious if all of you guys maybe some of
11:06 - you guys have no html css yet i mean
11:08 - anybody here know html css beautiful
11:10 - beautiful right your next step right or
11:12 - no matter what it is right no matter
11:14 - where you're at your next is going to be
11:15 - like to learn those javascript concepts
11:17 - as well absolutely
11:19 - um so like we're going to write them out
11:22 - here as well right variables
11:23 - conditionals arrays objects functions
11:26 - for loops dom manipulation so if you
11:29 - want to take a screenshot of that
11:31 - uh you can so i'll go here
11:34 - five four three two one
11:38 - okay awesome so now week three should
11:41 - look like this week three should be a
11:43 - combination of html css and javascript
11:46 - in your learning program that you do for
11:48 - yourself okay
11:49 - and you should build a clock app using
11:51 - html css and javascript that should be
11:54 - your week three's plan all right so that
11:57 - clock app actually can look something
11:59 - like this it's a very cool app
12:01 - it's 11 37 and then i'll go 11 38 11 39
12:04 - 11 40. but when it hits 12 now it goes
12:07 - back to 1201 1202 it doesn't go
12:10 - you know 11 62.
12:13 - so you need to learn how to be able to
12:14 - do that with javascript and html and css
12:18 - okay beautiful let's let you guys know
12:20 - we actually got this project from
12:22 - fundamental guys right so a lot of these
12:24 - products that we talk about they're they
12:26 - are out there right the designs are out
12:27 - there you just you can just use them
12:29 - inspiration and just build on top of
12:31 - that right there's so many things
12:33 - just have to kind of put in the work now
12:35 - at this point
12:36 - yes
12:37 - absolutely
12:38 - so let's keep on rocking and rolling
12:41 - here okay front-end mentor now this is
12:43 - your week four
12:44 - okay and let me know if i'm going too
12:46 - fast guys for you but this is gonna be
12:49 - week four so week four is to be html css
12:52 - javascript and what we want you to do is
12:54 - build a beatbox app beatbox app using
12:57 - objects in javascript so this is a fun
13:00 - one guys this is a fun one basically
13:02 - whenever you click on any button for
13:03 - example asd it's actually gonna play
13:06 - music it's fun for the kids a lot of
13:08 - students that we have actually used it
13:10 - with kids and they had a ton of fun so
13:12 - how like when you guys build this one as
13:14 - well yeah it's really cool you can play
13:15 - music right so whatever you play we have
13:17 - melissa on this live call and she made a
13:19 - beatbox app that made sounds of goats so
13:21 - you would hit g and it goes
13:23 - you hit h it's like
13:25 - like different goat sounds so you can do
13:28 - whatever you want um you can have it
13:30 - play like beats and all of that but this
13:32 - is going gonna really help you learn
13:35 - how javascript works what's uh event
13:37 - listener how do you connect event
13:38 - listener to buttons to your keyboard
13:40 - when you press h
13:42 - music plays how do you do that so it
13:44 - really will help you learn some core
13:46 - fundamental concepts yeah and one last
13:49 - thing guys is this simple nap actually
13:51 - will actually teach you something called
13:53 - object and write this down guys
13:55 - object oriented programming because you
13:57 - might have to use classes and such such
13:59 - a thing right so objective program one
14:01 - of the most important content you need
14:02 - to learn to actually get a job as well
14:04 - so this project will actually teach you
14:06 - that too yes absolutely here comes week
14:09 - five week five javascript learn data
14:13 - structures in javascript okay so when we
14:16 - say data structures we're talking about
14:17 - arrays cues link lists trees graphs hash
14:21 - tables which is a map okay
14:24 - and just going back to it you know all
14:26 - these things are something that's really
14:28 - important to learn in most computer
14:30 - science concepts and this is going to be
14:32 - the building blocks for you to really
14:34 - understand let's say like how the google
14:37 - search algorithm works
14:40 - what's up
14:41 - oh
14:42 - no it's good okay so these are the
14:45 - things that help you learn things like
14:47 - what's behind the scenes of a google
14:49 - algorithm right how are they using their
14:52 - search to make it so fast you know how
14:55 - is facebook using its algorithm to give
14:58 - you the best recommendations possible
15:00 - now they might be using some more
15:02 - complicated stuff with machine learning
15:04 - and algorithms and stuff like that but
15:06 - if you learn data structures
15:08 - you'll be able to understand the
15:09 - building blocks behind such fancy
15:12 - algorithms that are actually used on a
15:14 - daily basis like even when you're about
15:16 - to watch a netflix movie it knows what
15:18 - to recommend how does it know how to do
15:20 - that
15:21 - exactly and i think the most important
15:22 - here thing guys here is the fact that
15:24 - these things you need to learn not just
15:26 - because for the concepts
15:28 - but because most interviews will ask you
15:31 - about these right most interviews you go
15:32 - to make that big google facebook you
15:34 - know any interview maybe i even i went
15:36 - to right has asked me questions around
15:38 - this so if you want to pass the
15:40 - interview which is i mean probably what
15:41 - your goal is
15:42 - you have to literally you have to
15:43 - screenshot this this right now it is one
15:46 - of the most important slides you need to
15:48 - know to actually get that job you guys
15:50 - capisce yes got that very important a
15:53 - lot of people unfortunately missed that
15:54 - you know a lot of people just don't know
15:56 - they have a bunch of projects but they
15:58 - don't know those core concepts including
16:00 - these ones you know yep so make sure you
16:02 - guys learn that really really well now
16:04 - here's week six what you need to do
16:07 - learn algorithms in javascript okay so
16:10 - this is going to be things like you need
16:11 - to you should learn big-o notation
16:13 - iterations recursions sorting methods
16:16 - and just going back oh thank you for a
16:18 - five dollar donation for con really
16:20 - appreciate it um
16:22 - let me just go back to the right one
16:24 - week six
16:25 - okay
16:26 - and these algorithms like recursions and
16:29 - recursions and sorting methods it's like
16:31 - it sounds complicated but like if i gave
16:33 - you an array like a bucket full of
16:35 - numbers can you sort them in the right
16:37 - order
16:38 - recursions you know it allows you to do
16:40 - like if i have if i had a game like a
16:42 - maze game could you solve the maze with
16:45 - your like can you create a bot that can
16:47 - figure out the maze and how to get out
16:49 - of there and if you could solve that
16:52 - then one day maybe you could work with
16:54 - tesla and i don't know if you guys know
16:56 - but but now is my um you know he he
16:59 - showed me he can just press a button and
17:01 - his tesla car will actually drive itself
17:04 - out of the parking lot and towards him
17:07 - so how does it navigate its way out of
17:09 - these other cars like zigs and zags out
17:12 - of every other vehicle's way and
17:16 - stops at his footstep i mean that is
17:18 - absolutely mind-blowing but that also
17:21 - is using concepts like recursions or
17:24 - iterations and uh algorithms at the end
17:26 - of the day okay so it's just a
17:28 - simplistic i'm overly simplifying it but
17:30 - this hopefully gives you an idea of why
17:32 - you need to learn these things
17:34 - exactly exactly okay
17:37 - um with that said let's go on to what
17:39 - will be covered in week
17:41 - seven or what you should do in week
17:43 - seven as you're going through becomes
17:44 - the fun stuff guys the fun stuff we got
17:46 - react.js guys okay react just 101. now
17:50 - what does this mean right this means
17:51 - you'll be learning things like
17:52 - components right you'll be learning
17:53 - things like right how to pace how to
17:55 - like how to how to pass and data from
17:58 - one component to another component right
17:59 - and then today you know you need to
18:02 - learn the basics of react.js right and
18:05 - this is actually one of the funnest
18:06 - things you probably will get into as you
18:08 - become a front developer
18:10 - yes that's absolutely right react.js is
18:12 - going to be a really fun part
18:14 - but give yourself the treat when you
18:16 - deserve it after doing all the good boy
18:18 - and good girl things earlier okay don't
18:20 - give yourself the treat of react.js too
18:22 - early because
18:24 - trust me what's going to happen is
18:25 - you're going to start tripping over
18:26 - because you're going too fast
18:28 - all right
18:29 - uh so react.js right you will need to
18:32 - learn jsx so write that down this is
18:34 - basically your writing html um in
18:37 - javascript exactly functional components
18:40 - so you'll learn how to actually
18:42 - you know write functional components
18:44 - versus class-based components in the old
18:46 - days it was mostly class-based now
18:48 - functional functional looks
18:50 - way easier it's way easier to understand
18:51 - in my opinion and if you don't think
18:53 - about components guys by the way
18:54 - components are like little things right
18:56 - like who can tell me actually zoom chat
18:58 - what are components to you what
18:59 - components do you know we built that app
19:01 - for the uber clone right we have the
19:03 - components like for example the map was
19:04 - a component right yeah it's little
19:06 - blocks of code you can just put in
19:07 - anywhere you want so for example a fun
19:10 - component can be like a navbar it can be
19:12 - a component a sidebar can be a component
19:15 - a news feed can be a component um you
19:18 - know
19:19 - social icons that are underneath the
19:21 - post can all be one component the common
19:24 - section can be one component so you can
19:26 - think of things like building blocks or
19:28 - legos when i think of components i think
19:30 - of legos and when you put them together
19:32 - you get an app
19:34 - exactly exactly okay beautiful
19:37 - props you'll need to learn about that
19:38 - it's going to be important states so
19:40 - good job somebody said in the comments
19:42 - below you'll need to learn states you'll
19:44 - need to learn react hooks okay how do
19:46 - they work
19:47 - you'll need things use effect right the
19:48 - ones that we use right to be able to
19:50 - initially for example when you load a
19:52 - page and let's just say you go to
19:54 - facebook and you want to load you want
19:56 - to see all the posts well facebook is
19:58 - going to use like a react hook like use
19:59 - effect right use effect to be able to
20:02 - you load all these posts right after you
20:05 - load the page does that make sense guys
20:06 - yeah
20:07 - good and virtual dom is a concept that
20:10 - react introduced which essentially goes
20:12 - to you know
20:13 - um without being too technical and
20:16 - instead of like manipulating the real
20:18 - dom
20:19 - you manipulate a virtual dom which
20:21 - essentially just means you do things
20:23 - blazing fast okay and and react allows
20:25 - you to do that
20:27 - um cool now what you should do in this
20:30 - week which is i believe week seven in
20:32 - your week seven what you should do is
20:33 - build a to-do list app that looks
20:35 - somewhat similar to this this design is
20:37 - from front-end mentor
20:39 - and i don't know would you guys agree
20:40 - that this to-do list app looks freaking
20:43 - wonderful it's a lot mad better to list
20:45 - than what i used to build yeah so like
20:48 - build give yourself a project like this
20:51 - by the seventh week to do this let me
20:53 - ask you would you guys be excited if you
20:55 - were in your seventh week of learning
20:57 - coding and you were to build a project
20:59 - like this would that be exciting to you
21:01 - yeah i mean even that the clock app
21:04 - which was like week three week four like
21:06 - would that be exciting to you to build
21:07 - all those projects already like starting
21:09 - your week three big four because guys
21:11 - that is possible yes and i'm saying
21:13 - you'll be building this from scratch
21:15 - right not you're just watching a
21:16 - tutorial and copying it the goal is by
21:18 - week seven you should be able to build
21:20 - something like this from scratch
21:21 - bushrust says yes pedro says yes let's
21:24 - go yes yes yes
21:26 - yeah tons of people okay
21:27 - so week eight
21:29 - uh here's the plan rebuild the clock app
21:32 - but this time using react js so this
21:35 - will show you how you go from pure
21:37 - javascript to react and why you'll never
21:40 - go to pure javascript ever again because
21:42 - react just makes your life so much
21:44 - easier honestly
21:45 - yeah yeah yeah so rebuild this app in
21:47 - week eight week nine combine javascript
21:50 - and react and build a weather app with
21:52 - react.js
21:54 - that also has an api okay so this
21:56 - weather app you can make it look like
21:58 - this and it's pulling weather from a
22:01 - nearby location and whichever location i
22:03 - should pick like birmingham or
22:05 - manchester new york it should
22:07 - immediately change the weather just
22:09 - showing what's how many degrees it is
22:11 - outside
22:12 - what city is it uh and then whether it's
22:15 - cloudy or not with an icon
22:17 - right and then over here i can actually
22:19 - even search a location and type it in
22:22 - okay
22:23 - so take a screenshot of this project
22:25 - i'll give you guys five seconds to do
22:26 - that because this can be a good project
22:28 - for you to build in week eight and put
22:30 - on your portfolio late guys how cool
22:32 - does this look give us some fire if you
22:34 - think this looks amazing just like
22:36 - imagine imagine the recruiter who looked
22:38 - at your portfolio and saw this
22:40 - application right or saw this project on
22:41 - your portfolio right i mean even all the
22:43 - projects that we've included in here and
22:45 - they saw it like okay this person is
22:48 - serious they're not here to kid around
22:50 - they're not a joke around they are here
22:52 - to build amazing things would you agree
22:54 - with me on that one yeah i think so yeah
22:57 - i think if i saw your first project with
22:58 - your to-do list and this one i mean it's
23:01 - it really speaks volumes of your design
23:04 - and honestly one thing i had a
23:06 - conversation with somebody earlier and
23:08 - it's like your design skills are so
23:09 - important when it comes to front end
23:11 - developer world because you could be so
23:12 - freaking good and react but if your
23:14 - design looks really terrible
23:17 - you won't even get a chance for them to
23:19 - look into your code and see all the cool
23:21 - complex stuff that you're doing
23:23 - exactly all right so this is from
23:26 - dribble let's move on
23:28 - uh week 10 build a restaurant app with
23:31 - react.js so you can have a restaurant oh
23:33 - first of all this looks freaking awesome
23:36 - this is one of my favorite types of
23:37 - designs i love these types of designs
23:40 - they're so cool
23:41 - yeah
23:42 - and this actually comes from dribble too
23:44 - and if you guys search up if you go guys
23:46 - go to dribble.com you search up any for
23:48 - example website right may that be like a
23:49 - weather app or you search up you know
23:52 - like a restaurant app they'll pull up so
23:54 - many means designers you can use them
23:55 - just for inspiration just like this and
23:57 - if you create it like oh my god it looks
23:59 - so good yeah this is beautiful so build
24:03 - something like this in week 10 all right
24:05 - this is going to be a good thing that
24:07 - you guys can build
24:09 - uh 12 weeks in total is the game plan
24:11 - that we're showing you somebody just ask
24:13 - week 11 we're up to week 11 now you're
24:15 - very close to becoming a front-end
24:17 - developer okay and starting to even
24:19 - apply to jobs at this point as a junior
24:21 - developer
24:22 - but you can build an amazon clone with
24:24 - react.js so at this point honestly you
24:26 - should be able to do it by yourself
24:29 - but if you're not you can watch our
24:30 - videos on it as well and this is the
24:32 - amazon clone we want you to build
24:34 - because the
24:35 - actual amazon clone too many people have
24:37 - built it um i think if you build
24:40 - something like this this is super modern
24:42 - it's freaking cool it looks better i
24:44 - would say so it looks way better
24:46 - honestly and it just makes you stand out
24:49 - yeah yeah like i mean yeah like if i saw
24:51 - it as a recruiter again it's like holy
24:53 - moly like if i imagine you actually
24:55 - applying to amazon right with this
24:58 - project you're like yo amazon check out
24:59 - what i did right you guys should listen
25:00 - to me you know
25:02 - okay
25:03 - i think they'll be like okay
25:04 - they're like actually yeah you do the
25:06 - redesign i'm gonna leave thank you yeah
25:09 - exactly so bill
25:11 - yeah so build something like this in
25:13 - your week 11 and this project here
25:17 - i freaking promise you like this
25:19 - recruiter see this they are gonna hit
25:21 - you up for a interview
25:22 - they see this they want to go look
25:25 - deeper into your code and give you a
25:27 - chance for an interview so these are
25:29 - massive projects we've had so many
25:31 - people put projects like these on their
25:33 - portfolios and actually get interviews
25:35 - and then get jobs
25:36 - you still need to
25:38 - have skills to show when you're at the
25:41 - interview which our goal is that if you
25:43 - do all of this right by week 11 you'll
25:45 - have those skills okay but at least you
25:47 - got the interview right that's one of
25:48 - the hardest things to get just in
25:49 - general guys right yeah to get the
25:51 - interview right you want to get noticed
25:52 - first and then then you have to worry
25:54 - about the other problems which is okay
25:55 - how do i pass the interview yeah that's
25:57 - yeah that's a whole different problem
25:59 - okay
26:00 - and week 12
26:02 - is essentially you should do job hunting
26:05 - in that week all right so in that week
26:07 - you should like be looking at what other
26:09 - job opportunities are out there what
26:11 - types of things you can do we're showing
26:12 - one of our students nasir he's 16 years
26:15 - old and i think like this is a really
26:17 - good example to show you guys because
26:19 - he's 16 he's not even in america he's in
26:22 - pakistan so the opportunity to be able
26:24 - to get jobs are paid is even way harder
26:26 - out there
26:27 - right and
26:29 - he
26:30 - has made over 12 thousand dollars
26:33 - freelancing and using his react and
26:37 - django skills to be able to land jobs
26:39 - like that's pretty freaking cool and as
26:41 - soon as you guys think by the way and
26:43 - now he's actually in the zoom click on
26:44 - the j gonna bring him on as well
26:46 - oh yeah if he wants to jump on real
26:48 - quick
26:50 - here he is right here oh he's here nice

27:10 - i guess share with us you know uh what
27:13 - have you like what did you do and how
27:15 - were you able to actually generate
27:17 - income from coding at such a young age i
27:20 - think everybody wants to know that and
27:22 - are you even 16 i thought you were 15 or
27:24 - something i thought you were yeah
27:26 - last year

29:11 - introducing profit with react
29:15 - guys this is a brand new course that we
29:19 - have just launched okay
29:21 - um and
29:23 - essentially profit with react is a
29:25 - self-paced course and is designed to
29:27 - help you learn the skills you need to
29:29 - become a front-end developer within
29:31 - seven weeks
29:32 - now before i continue is it okay if i
29:35 - can share more about this program with
29:37 - you guys to have your permission for
29:38 - that

29:49 - rocking and rolling here so here's what
29:51 - you guys get in profit with react and
29:54 - you know uh it's seven modules of
29:56 - react.js and it covers what we were
29:59 - showing you guys to cover in 12 weeks
30:02 - the goal is to jam pack that into seven
30:04 - weeks so you can even get those results
30:06 - faster now keep in mind you'll have to
30:09 - work hard
30:11 - right to be able to make up for that
30:12 - time since it's not 12 weeks or seven
30:14 - weeks but if you could have those skills
30:17 - in seven weeks would that be exciting to
30:18 - you guys yes or no
30:20 - yes god this is not for those this is
30:22 - not for those who want to sit down lay
30:25 - down watch netflix so they know it is
30:27 - for those who work hard right and if you
30:29 - do work hard you will get the result
30:31 - it's just it's just i think it's simple
30:32 - down it's like yeah i mean i will
30:35 - probably get into my story at some point
30:36 - if you guys are ever interested but like
30:38 - yeah i when i started coding and picked
30:40 - it up i worked my goddamn face off uh to
30:43 - learn the skill it was brutal but it was
30:45 - worth it at the end so how this will
30:48 - work guys this course it's going to be a
30:50 - pre-order of this course okay so this
30:53 - course will start in december 8th okay
30:56 - december 8th is when the official start
30:58 - date will be and then every module for
31:01 - the next seven weeks will be dripped out

32:18 - raise your hand guys if you're kind of
32:20 - sick of that you're sick of those ones

33:31 - html css
33:34 - javascript because those things are very
33:36 - very important for you to learn all the
33:38 - building blocks that we just talked
33:39 - about guys right the bottom lines that
33:40 - we talked about which are really really
33:41 - important those who do need them you
33:43 - will be learning them as well absolutely
33:46 - and we're also going to be having you
33:49 - build some fire projects in this course
33:51 - so there's some projects i'm going to

33:54 - projects we might just drop as a
33:56 - surprise bonus for you all but check it
33:58 - out you're going to be building an epic
34:01 - real-time chat app kind of like what's
34:03 - app okay
34:05 - and we're going to be going deep into
34:07 - how to make it work and just make it
34:09 - absolutely amazing but how this is going
34:11 - to be more different than any youtube
34:14 - tutorial on it out there is we're going
34:16 - to break it up into projects and
34:19 - step-by-step exercises for you so when
34:21 - you build this you completely build it
34:24 - yourself by completing tons of exercises
34:27 - not just by watching a youtube video and
34:30 - like copying the code and now you've
34:32 - built it does that make sense guys
34:34 - yeah that makes sense
34:36 - now i want to just copy a bunch of a
34:38 - bunch of code raise your hand i'm really
34:40 - curious
34:41 - yeah that's right right so it's like our
34:43 - goal is very important
34:44 - it's very important right copying code
34:46 - is good but it's not what's going to
34:48 - teach you right a lot of our students a
34:49 - lot of like people students that i know
34:51 - who just copy code and then they just
34:54 - end up kind of like when they are faced
34:55 - with the real problems with the real you
34:57 - know world coding problems they have a
35:00 - harder time so our goal is to put you
35:01 - right there in the driver's seat yep
35:04 - to make sure you're actually coding
35:06 - there with us and actually brainstorming
35:09 - and problem solving too
35:11 - absolutely okay absolutely you're also
35:14 - going to be building an amazing project
35:16 - another amazing project which is close
35:18 - to my heart because i love i absolutely
35:21 - love chess
35:22 - any second that i get for free i am like
35:25 - finding ways to play chess so in this
35:28 - i'm going to be putting my heart and
35:29 - soul for you guys and having us build a
35:32 - multiplayer chess app and i think this
35:35 - project will actually
35:37 - have you step above the crowd so much
35:40 - because it's a unique project not
35:42 - everybody's going to have this on their
35:43 - portfolio
35:44 - and it shows some incredible skills of
35:47 - yours like how do you actually have
35:48 - multiplayer game with react because most
35:51 - people don't show you that
35:53 - right yeah
35:54 - this is going to be the the thing that
35:56 - actually wows the recruiters right yeah
35:58 - like that's you know it's all cool you
36:00 - know it's all fun and games to build
36:02 - these projects who are like landing
36:04 - pages and stuff like that but when you
36:05 - get to interact with multiple people and
36:08 - you have multiple technologies like
36:09 - react router like react gs right and
36:12 - firebase even right that's when it
36:14 - really makes you kind of think
36:16 - differently and it really puts you above
36:18 - everybody else on their critics side
36:20 - absolutely and with this project you
36:22 - guys are going to be doing react you're
36:24 - going to be mastering react router
36:26 - firebase even howler gs which is a sound
36:28 - library because when each move happens
36:31 - it makes a sound when you checkmate that
36:34 - makes a sound how do you detect if it's
36:35 - a check i mean there's a lot and plus if
36:38 - you don't know how to play chess you'll
36:39 - even learn how to play chess in this
36:41 - okay which is going to open up a whole
36:42 - new world for you and you can challenge
36:44 - me at any point you want
36:47 - and and this also has a crazy amount of
36:49 - other things like user authentication
36:50 - you can log in you can see who the user
36:52 - you're playing against is
36:54 - it goes deep so i'm excited for you guys
36:56 - to see this you're also going to be
36:58 - building an amazing to-do app which is
37:00 - going to use react redux style
37:03 - components and things like that so those
37:05 - projects are going to be learning and
37:06 - putting it on your portfolio as well
37:08 - on top of that you're going to be
37:10 - getting an awesome exclusive slack
37:12 - community so you guys see in the chats
37:14 - right now you guys are all talking
37:16 - engaging you see all the amazing faces
37:18 - that are around you these are the faces
37:21 - and the hungry and the ambitious people
37:22 - that you're going to be seeing inside of
37:24 - this community as well
37:25 - yes what's the problem guys raise your
37:27 - hand guys if you feel something's alone
37:28 - when you're coding well raise your hand
37:30 - if you feel like alone when you're
37:31 - trying to learn this because this is not
37:33 - an easy field to feel exactly everybody
37:35 - right it's not an easy field to be in
37:37 - right it's very complicating right
37:39 - complicated it is very confusing
37:42 - sometimes right and there's a lot of
37:44 - people trying to do it right and when
37:46 - you try to first start out you might
37:48 - feel like you're just by yourself and so
37:50 - it might even discourage you but versus
37:53 - raise your hand if you agree with me if
37:54 - you have a group of people who have the
37:56 - same goals who are trusted driven
37:59 - to push you attached to it as well would
38:01 - you do it then raise your hand yes yes
38:03 - yes
38:04 - exactly ton of hands
38:06 - that's the difference guys you have all
38:08 - those people with you supporting you
38:10 - you're gonna crush your goals
38:13 - it becomes simple at that point
38:16 - so you're gonna have a community like
38:18 - this inside of slack every day people
38:20 - are gonna be there jumping in talking
38:22 - you know coming up with ideas sharing
38:24 - with you everything that they're
38:25 - learning you're gonna be sharing the
38:26 - stuff that you're learning you guys are
38:28 - gonna be making progress together right
38:30 - and then the coaching calls whenever
38:31 - they're happening we'll also drop in the
38:32 - times for you guys so you can jump into
38:35 - those calls
38:36 - now with all of that said the other
38:39 - thing that we're going to be giving you
38:41 - guys with this is 30 day money back
38:43 - guarantee okay and the point of this is
38:45 - we don't want you to risk anything
38:46 - either you love the course or you get
38:50 - your money back
38:51 - okay hopefully that makes sense to you

38:55 - simple cool guys
38:57 - so guys if on 29th day

40:46 - calls will be delivered to you weekly
40:48 - okay so for seven weeks
40:50 - you're gonna have access to exclusive
40:52 - slack community you're going to build
40:54 - real world projects like a real-time
40:56 - messaging app you're going to build a
40:57 - chess game all of these projects are
41:00 - going to be portfolio ready that you'll
41:01 - be able to slap onto your portfolio
41:05 - um and guess what

41:26 - call
41:27 - let me show you uh this is the most
41:29 - insane deal we've ever offered and we're
41:31 - just excited because we want to give
41:33 - people the chance for everybody who's
41:35 - been so loyal for the five days like you
41:37 - know anthony you've been showing up
41:38 - brother dakota like eduardo fabio sam
41:42 - you know sam sehar dirk like all of you
41:44 - guys luna like if i didn't mention any
41:46 - of you i'd been seeing you guys over the
41:48 - five days you guys are hardcore fans so
41:50 - we wanted to give you guys something
41:51 - special okay
41:53 - um
41:54 - and in the next 30 minutes only actually
41:56 - scratch that in the next 20 minutes only
41:59 - okay here's what we're going to be doing
42:03 - as a bonus
42:05 - here's what you're going to get
42:08 - profit with javascript
42:11 - that's right that's right so you guys
42:13 - get two courses basically yep so profit
42:17 - exactly so you're going to be getting
42:18 - profit with javascript guys this is our
42:20 - mega flagship course we've launched it
42:22 - over the last two years
42:24 - we have thousands of students enrolled
42:26 - in this program absolutely love it their
42:29 - minds were blown with the value and
42:32 - this is over 13 modules of training okay
42:35 - and this goes deep into javascript so if
42:38 - you guys were like hey
42:39 - do we also get to learn javascript and
42:41 - master those skills before we move on to
42:43 - react this this course will help you
42:46 - master that in so much detail it's
42:48 - insane
42:49 - and what this will do is that one month
42:51 - you're waiting after you pre-order the
42:54 - profit of the react course you'll be
42:55 - able to go through and master react in
42:57 - that master javascript in that time so
43:00 - then when you get to react
43:01 - you're going to be so much stronger in
43:03 - your foundational understanding of
43:05 - everything that's happening does that
43:06 - make sense guys
43:08 - yes so guys who here still needs to
43:10 - learn those foundations right who feel
43:12 - that they still need to learn those
43:13 - foundations right so if you that's what
43:15 - you need guys right
43:16 - this is going to be it right this is
43:18 - going to teach you all those bare bones
43:19 - nasir is actually part of this right how
43:22 - do you think he got to where he is today
43:23 - right he was part of those these courses
43:26 - courses like these yeah mar was a pro
43:27 - part of this course and she started
43:29 - making 96 thousand dollars a year nasir
43:31 - was in grid was as well that we showed
43:33 - you
43:33 - exactly it's an amazing community right
43:35 - and so you guys will get to be part of
43:37 - that community which also includes
43:39 - things like coaching calls right and so
43:41 - forth so maybe you can talk a little bit
43:42 - more about that and check this out guys
43:45 - so here you have four to five projects
43:48 - that you're going to be building inside
43:50 - of profit with javascript itself so
43:53 - you're gonna be building your own blog
43:54 - app a blackjack app you're gonna build a
43:57 - twitter app you're gonna build a google
43:59 - maps store locator and you'll even be
44:02 - building your own chrome extension and
44:04 - you'll be deploying it to chrome
44:06 - that's right you actually have your own
44:08 - chrome app it's crazy i have a lot of
44:09 - students who built it and put it
44:12 - literally on the chrome chrome app store
44:14 - and people are actually using it the
44:16 - chrome app that we built you know like
44:18 - the first one that i built to teach you
44:20 - guys right literally is being used by i
44:22 - think the last time i checked and don't
44:24 - quote me on this one i think it's like
44:25 - 400 people or something right that
44:26 - downloaded it it was pretty crazy and so
44:28 - you guys get to build that too oh really
44:30 - yeah yeah it's like there's a lot of
44:31 - users and there's a lot of five stars
44:33 - too as well oh snap i want to actually

69:28 - this rate they're probably gonna run out
69:30 - tomorrow um not even until november 12th
69:34 - honestly
69:36 - yeah by the way guys those of you asking
69:37 - like why is it you know cost more if you
69:39 - pay than 160 you know for three months
69:41 - it's because you get this kind of people
69:42 - paying full that's just as simple as
69:44 - that right so if you fully get a
69:45 - discount if you're paying in three
69:46 - months of course it's just a little more
69:47 - expensive that's it
69:49 - yes
69:50 - okay cool
69:51 - um derrick uh dirk says i'm in it
69:54 - beautiful

75:30 - six months trying to convince him to
75:32 - quit his pharmacy job at cvs oh yeah he

75:38 - quit and then he uh you know we just we
75:41 - were just coding together every single
75:43 - day years and years and years ago and
75:45 - then he finally got a job as a developer
75:48 - and then we were both on pace to be
75:49 - making six figures um but yeah and then
75:52 - he started his youtube channel called

76:08 - hey what's going on bro nice to have you
76:11 - in what made you pull the trigger and
76:13 - join
76:15 - honestly um i've been debating for the
76:18 - last few
76:31 - this is my fifth year and i still have
76:33 - another year after this semester so i'm
76:35 - going to be halfway through the sixth
76:37 - year wow i even graduate
76:39 - uh and i don't even know hardly anything
76:41 - for what i'm actually going for i'm
76:43 - going for game design and development
76:45 - and i've had like maybe four or five
76:47 - classes in five years that have taught
76:50 - me
76:51 - anything related to my
76:53 - degree i've actually learned more web
76:55 - design
76:56 - uh
76:57 - or ui design or whatever then i have
77:00 - game design wow what i'm actually saying
77:02 - you know
77:04 - so i've
77:05 - originally was just gonna learn html css
77:08 - to
77:09 - build a portfolio but uh now i'm really
77:11 - getting into it i just i want to learn
77:13 - more and i want to learn javascript
77:16 - and react.js and all these web
77:18 - technologies for front end development
77:21 - uh and an internship by next summer
77:24 - hopefully um so that way i can have that
77:27 - on my portfolio and maybe start some
77:29 - freelance work as well smart man very
77:31 - smart very yeah it's so true a lot of
77:33 - students unfortunately you know do not
77:35 - get the education they they want when
77:36 - they go to you know university right i'm
77:38 - not trying to bring down universities
77:39 - right but like to me like i went to
77:41 - university as well but honestly like
77:43 - what i know today is not what i learned
77:45 - from university right like there are
77:46 - some aspects there are some good
77:47 - teachers that i did love there were like
77:49 - one or two classes that were really good
77:50 - for me right but most of classes like i
77:53 - was learning c plus you know and like
77:55 - some java and that's pretty much it
77:56 - right but there's like new technologies
77:58 - which is like like i was learning like
78:00 - like git but it wasn't even get you know
78:02 - what i mean like the old kit right
78:04 - before you became kid it was crazy like
78:06 - why do we need to learn this right but
78:09 - yeah unfortunately you know just it's
78:10 - harder for some types of universities to
78:12 - keep up with it with you know the new
78:14 - technologies that's it
78:16 - yeah yeah i'm kind of lucky that the
78:18 - school that i go to is very cheap i went
78:21 - to kind of a local school but it's a
78:23 - satellite of a bigger
78:24 - university so i'm only paying like maybe
78:26 - five thousand dollars a semester
78:29 - uh so it's not too bad but i mean it
78:32 - could have been way worse i'm just not
78:33 - learning what i wanted to learn and now
78:36 - i'm starting to get into i really want
78:38 - to learn it more beautiful well well
78:41 - excited to have you here dakota my
78:42 - friend would you tell those people who
78:44 - are looking to join or maybe are not
78:46 - sure about what would you tell them
78:48 - i tell them honestly go ahead and join
78:51 - it's so much cheaper than college don't
78:53 - do what i did don't spend five thousand
78:55 - dollars a semester spend three hundred
78:57 - dollars or four hundred dollars now
78:59 - yeah beautiful guys 60 spots left 40
79:02 - spots got taken right on this call
79:05 - that's crazy and so just make sure if

93:34 - that makes me happy
93:47 - um
93:55 - how do you consult like hello hello
93:57 - world i think that's always the starting
93:58 - point right
94:07 - how do you feel like when you know of
94:09 - course you know why do you think
94:10 - education is important to you in general
94:13 - well
94:14 - we're in this field here
94:16 - today
94:25 - exactly that's a really good point
94:26 - that's a really good point yeah yeah
94:28 - it's always about learning like of
94:29 - course the more skills you learn the
94:31 - more you earn you know people say that
94:33 - right and i'm a big believer that you
94:35 - know
94:36 - who you know in this world right knowing
94:38 - a lot of different skills not
94:39 - specifically is going to be the most
94:41 - important thing right yes you know we
94:43 - always say learn one thing first and
94:45 - then of course expand from that but you
94:47 - know nowadays people are learning and
94:49 - react and moving on from that right so
94:51 - the more you learn the more fundamentals
94:53 - you know um i think the more valuable
94:55 - you just become and then and then at
94:57 - that point like you know employers look
94:58 - at you and you're like like we just need
95:00 - you and that's it you know
95:02 - yeah absolutely i mean i've been doing
95:04 - full stack for for
95:07 - 10 years
95:09 - like i said before you got to learn the
95:11 - basics
95:13 - you can't build it's like trying to
95:14 - build the roof
95:17 - yes before you put the house
95:20 - up before you put the laws up the
95:21 - foundation that's right
95:24 - these guys will start to add the
95:25 - foundation dave very very basic all the
95:28 - way to the advance dave thank you so
95:30 - much for sharing that brother i'm gonna

96:13 - um so i i
96:16 - was in a boot camp um i don't want to
96:19 - mention the name but um
96:21 - it was you know it was a good experience
96:24 - but like i just felt like i needed more
96:26 - um
96:27 - the lesson i just didn't feel like it
96:30 - was really really rushed in
96:32 - um
96:33 - i didn't really
96:35 - take much value
96:39 - um so i was basically doing things on my
96:43 - own researching researching things on my
96:45 - own
96:46 - and trying to you know um
96:49 - you know talk to other students in the
96:51 - slack community
96:52 - um but everyone was just
96:54 - you know
96:56 - working on their own thing you know yeah
96:58 - um to reach out with instructors but
97:00 - like you know everyone was just like hey
97:02 - i'm just worked up
97:04 - like
97:19 - for that reason
97:20 - and then you're just like
97:22 - i don't know what to do but so i just
97:24 - had to wing it the whole time um i
97:27 - graduated but like i don't know
97:30 - like a lot of things a lot of things
97:32 - like there's like a lot of things you
97:34 - guys mentioned and i don't know it
97:37 - no
97:38 - a lot of students that i know as well
97:39 - who came back at these other boot camps
97:41 - right as well like you know one of our
97:43 - students but on came from a different
97:44 - boot camp actually you know also like
97:47 - when he graduate i'm not gonna name that
97:48 - name as well but he graduated too like
97:50 - he felt like he you know didn't really
97:53 - learn much right so yeah right he felt
97:55 - like he just wasn't ready and so we
97:56 - actually taught him those fundamentals
97:58 - that he needed to learn and that's how
97:59 - he actually got you know a job of
98:01 - gravity payments that at this point
98:02 - actually i know he said 70k she now pays
98:04 - in 93k i actually talked to him recently
98:06 - what the hell
98:07 - yeah he actually gets paid 93 he get a
98:09 - bonus he got he got a raise now
98:11 - yeah so i talked to him like about i
98:12 - think two weeks ago actually yeah but
98:14 - yeah it's i totally don't understand
98:16 - that so we're excited to have you here
98:17 - and thank you so much for joining and
98:19 - what would you tell those people who are
98:20 - potentially thinking about you know
98:22 - joining something like this
98:23 - i think they should go for it because if
98:25 - they want if they're hungry to learn how
98:27 - to
98:28 - you know make a websites or web
98:30 - applications
98:31 - for it pencey can i ask you something
98:34 - um
98:36 - oh fabio says when i'm done with the
98:37 - program will you give me a job at
98:38 - cleverprogrammer if you're really really
98:41 - good
98:42 - and you're a good human that's right
98:44 - you know
98:46 - i just want to ask you like
98:48 - you you talk to me about your coding
98:50 - bootcamp what makes you feel like
98:52 - what makes you take a chance on this
98:54 - right because if i'm you i'm
98:57 - a little scared at this point because
98:58 - man i just invested so much in a coding
99:01 - boot camp so now this is a risk for me
99:03 - what made you what made you take a
99:06 - chance on this what makes you took a
99:08 - chance on us
99:09 - because you teach well
99:11 - that's the whole thing if the experience
99:13 - is well you teach well yeah
99:16 - you're gonna you're gonna do well
99:18 - you're gonna you don't understand you
99:19 - better grasp everything you're gonna
99:21 - understand like you go things step by
99:23 - step
99:24 - um you
99:26 - are able to teach us you don't you
99:29 - you're just not like slapping things and
99:30 - then like here
99:32 - it's like learning yeah take this
99:34 - yeah
99:35 - you just it's um more like i feel like
99:38 - it's more real
99:40 - real world projects yeah um so yeah and
99:44 - where did you test the teaching
99:46 - experience was it the uber challenge
99:48 - were you here for the whole uber
99:49 - challenge

100:07 - like very you know
100:09 - precise and like
100:11 - you know like why did you put this
100:12 - component and why did you do this and
100:14 - like i really loved the fact that like
100:17 - you were showing us um
100:19 - the ready-made like uh you know um
100:22 - design i guess i would say yeah like
100:25 - um the back button and then like you
100:28 - know you gotta put the um you know this
100:30 - is a container this is another routine
100:32 - yeah i didn't i i didn't learn that like
100:35 - you know it's basically like the
100:36 - framework like you need to know the
100:38 - framework first as a designer i didn't
100:40 - learn that like so i think that's really
100:42 - important
100:44 - oh wow hear that yeah

101:36 - guys i was like hey you know
101:39 - they went through a whole lot of loops
101:41 - and figured out a way to
101:43 - make money with coding which you know
101:47 - they don't quite teach this stuff in
101:48 - college so i'm like yeah i could see the
101:50 - value you know coming from this program
101:52 - and

we're going to be announcing something very special today so be on the lookout you don't want to miss out okay stay all the way till the end uh let me take my zoom here out of the way so on youtube it looks a little bit better and uh let's start going okay so roadmap to becoming a frontend developer and this is going to be different than the first day that we did guys because this is going to be a week by week guide so definitely have something to write with as usual go ahead nas no i was saying guys make sure you guys there's a lot of intricate parts in you know in this talk specifically we did a different guide before now we're breaking things down a lot a lot deeper yes tag us on instagram cleverkozynostomonsky and this is your frontend guide so let's do this now let's quickly recap day four we got 6 500 views on youtube 200 people watching us live so that was incredible 30 homework submissions and without any further ado let's jump right into it what's the top secret there's a big top secret that's gonna be revealed today and we're gonna be revealing something we've been working on behind the scenes for quite some time and i think y'all are gonna love it okay i'm excited let's get started with today's training so here we go you're a road map to becoming a friend and developer in 90 days first of all who here wants to become a frontend developer in the next 90 days either raise your hands or drop it in the comments so i can see it i'm really curious guys come on come on come on seeing lots of hands go up fabio anthony nice david zachary beautiful guys this is what we do at clever programmer okay over 5000 students are learning from us and have gotten incredible results we have students that have gotten jobs at companies like spotify amazon sonos microsoft disney paypal blue origin youtube google facebook and the list goes on are there any companies here that you guys would be excited to work for if yes give me put your hands up or just say i in the chat or somewhere so we can see it okay i'm really curious what company would you want to work for if it's not on here what come with your work i'm really curious to see fair enough drop that in the chat as well so we can see it apple yep google apple tesla nice i want to work for clever programmer pedro nice okay beautiful um so guys on youtube we have officially hit over 1 million subscribers which is kind of crazy to say that but we finally hit that goal um and you know we are over in 200 countries with our online stateoftheart education program so just want to say thank you guys so much for all the love and the support um can we get that on mute please oh hold on hold on okay that got really loud okay yeah yeah okay did you admit yourself by the way make sure you i mean yourself yep i'm good okay so according to glassdoor like we showed you guys this is how much a frontend developer makes on indeed there are tons of job openings available as you guys know and we've shown you guys the bs everybody shows you when it comes to frontend developer or becoming a fullstack developer but it's just not true you need to know a few things so here's what we say instead we said the technologies you need to know to become a frontend developer are html css javascript and then the next thing that you need to master is really algorithms and data structures and that's really interesting why why did i structure algorithms i'm curious because it's so freaking important to know these at a deep level because look at this your fancy projects will get you the interviews and then algorithms and data structures and your problem solving skills will actually help you land the job it is your foundations guys right it's like whenever you build a house guys definition that you got right that's the platform if you got a bad foundation that house what happens to the house it falls down yeah we don't want that so we want to have those down really really solid yup that's exactly right and that's why we say going slow is fast the reason why we said going slow is fast can you guys tell us in the chat why you think we might still going slow as fast okay now here's what i'm going to say going slow is fast and that's our slogan because people want to learn all the fanciest frameworks you want to learn next you want to learn like the hottest things you want to learn react and all of that stuff is really really good but if your foundation is weak everything is going to come crumbling down if you actually work on problem solving and you just learn things like javascript really well and really deeply and then you learn react then your skills are really strong and so you might be slow in the start but you actually become a much better developer over time okay exactly what you call this is like you prevent yourself from being a pinball machine right you probably raise your hand here or probably if you're in the comments on youtube let us know in the comments if you've been situation where like every single thing you knew you see you want to do that thing right you go from one technology to another technology to another technology and then you just feel like you're not getting anywhere raise your hand if you feel like that i'm really curious raise your hand up high up high raise your hands if you think you've ever been stuck in tutorial hell where you just go from tutorial tutorial and it doesn't make sense and you get stuck i see tons of hands going up right this is exactly the problem and so now we're going to start giving you the things that you need to master so start writing these down you need to actually master react okay react is going to be a very fundamental key component in you becoming a frontend developer especially if you want to become a react developer okay master this before you move on to things like next or something else yeah and again that's because right these are the core principles right companies will look at you what you know in terms of javascript html css but in order to build large scale applications like we're talking facebook netflix all these other ones then you do have to you know learn technologies like react absolutely learn a state management tool like redux so write the word down state management okay and then you can learn anything underneath the state management umbrella you can learn context api you can learn redux you can learn whatever else is out there but redux is one of the most valuable ones because a ton of companies use it and tons of projects hundreds of thousands of projects depend on redux and a simple way to describe to you what redux is have you ever used an app like let's say instacart or maybe even amazon or something else and you go and you order food right when you're about to go order food and you add it to your cart well nothing refreshes yet it adds things to your cart and if you go back and forth between multiple pages your cart still remembers where you left off right how is that happening and all lightning fast and your car remembers it that's where redux kicks in it's actually managing the state have you ever gone to a website where you hit a toggle button and all of a sudden goes from bright screen to a dark screen that's also state management and redux is at play there even for example you go on facebook guys you go on facebook you log in with your facebook account and then you exit facebook but then you come back it's still there right it'd be a really bad experience if you every time you go to the browser you go to facebook.com and you always have to log in like i never remember a password right yeah so you don't want to do that either so that's why remember redux remember state management very valuable next up is git version control which is like we've told you already so we're not going to go too deep into it but this is your time machine for your uh code and github is where your code goes to live so this is just a little bit of refresher from what we did on day one now firebase is going to be where your data is stored plus you can actually allow users to be authenticated so make sure that you have firebase under your belt because it's a very good realtime database to learn in combination with react exactly and so if you want to build like applications like whatsapp messenger to have like a live messaging you ever wonder how that happens yeah exactly firebase allows you to do that yes absolutely uh now let's break down your journey into next into 12 weeks how you can actually go step by step in next 12 weeks and learn these skills all right so week number one here's what you can write down on your roadmap to do just practice and learn html and css okay and build a portfolio website using html and css so make that your first week's mission all right this is very doable and you can make a you know portfolio that looks like this or you can model something that looks good you know something that you like but you can take a screenshot of this right now if you want because this can be a really good portfolio project for you to do okay i'm going to give you guys five seconds to take a screenshot of this five four three two one okay mark winters i'm going to read his comments my main reason honestly for switching was because there isn't as much enthusiasm in other languages you guys are in fire and make react interesting awesome thank you yup um cool all right moving on this design is from dribbble.com and dribble with three b's cool yeah and if you know by the way by the way guys if you want to find some really good uh you know portfolio websites where where you know where to get them like joe.com is a good not a good one the fundamentals was a really good one as well another uh good website you can see absolutely portfolio building just copy them you just like copy them slash you know build on top of them yeah exactly now learning the fundamentals of javascript is going to be your week two all right that's what we're moving on to week two so write this down learn the fundamentals of javascript so when we say fundamentals these are like the core for example you know what's a variable uh how do you add two numbers together what happens what's a string what's an array what's a object how do you write a loop how do you write a for loop how do you write a while loop what's an if else condition all these things are the fundamental building blocks of javascript and most computer science and programming languages so you need to understand them really well before you start going to more advanced things even if that's react okay that's that comes later and i think it's very important because like you know a lot of students tell me a lot of people told me hey nas i know html no css i'm a developer now this is easy stuff i'm like oh you haven't gone to the real stuff yet right so like raise your hand i'm really curious if all of you guys maybe some of you guys have no html css yet i mean anybody here know html css beautiful beautiful right your next step right or no matter what it is right no matter where you're at your next is going to be like to learn those javascript concepts as well absolutely um so like we're going to write them out here as well right variables conditionals arrays objects functions for loops dom manipulation so if you want to take a screenshot of that uh you can so i'll go here five four three two one okay awesome so now week three should look like this week three should be a combination of html css and javascript in your learning program that you do for yourself okay and you should build a clock app using html css and javascript that should be your week three's plan all right so that clock app actually can look something like this it's a very cool app it's 11 37 and then i'll go 11 38 11 39 11 40. but when it hits 12 now it goes back to 1201 1202 it doesn't go you know 11 62. so you need to learn how to be able to do that with javascript and html and css okay beautiful let's let you guys know we actually got this project from fundamental guys right so a lot of these products that we talk about they're they are out there right the designs are out there you just you can just use them inspiration and just build on top of that right there's so many things just have to kind of put in the work now at this point yes absolutely so let's keep on rocking and rolling here okay frontend mentor now this is your week four okay and let me know if i'm going too fast guys for you but this is gonna be week four so week four is to be html css javascript and what we want you to do is build a beatbox app beatbox app using objects in javascript so this is a fun one guys this is a fun one basically whenever you click on any button for example asd it's actually gonna play music it's fun for the kids a lot of students that we have actually used it with kids and they had a ton of fun so how like when you guys build this one as well yeah it's really cool you can play music right so whatever you play we have melissa on this live call and she made a beatbox app that made sounds of goats so you would hit g and it goes you hit h it's like like different goat sounds so you can do whatever you want um you can have it play like beats and all of that but this is going gonna really help you learn how javascript works what's uh event listener how do you connect event listener to buttons to your keyboard when you press h music plays how do you do that so it really will help you learn some core fundamental concepts yeah and one last thing guys is this simple nap actually will actually teach you something called object and write this down guys object oriented programming because you might have to use classes and such such a thing right so objective program one of the most important content you need to learn to actually get a job as well so this project will actually teach you that too yes absolutely here comes week five week five javascript learn data structures in javascript okay so when we say data structures we're talking about arrays cues link lists trees graphs hash tables which is a map okay and just going back to it you know all these things are something that's really important to learn in most computer science concepts and this is going to be the building blocks for you to really understand let's say like how the google search algorithm works what's up oh no it's good okay so these are the things that help you learn things like what's behind the scenes of a google algorithm right how are they using their search to make it so fast you know how is facebook using its algorithm to give you the best recommendations possible now they might be using some more complicated stuff with machine learning and algorithms and stuff like that but if you learn data structures you'll be able to understand the building blocks behind such fancy algorithms that are actually used on a daily basis like even when you're about to watch a netflix movie it knows what to recommend how does it know how to do that exactly and i think the most important here thing guys here is the fact that these things you need to learn not just because for the concepts but because most interviews will ask you about these right most interviews you go to make that big google facebook you know any interview maybe i even i went to right has asked me questions around this so if you want to pass the interview which is i mean probably what your goal is you have to literally you have to screenshot this this right now it is one of the most important slides you need to know to actually get that job you guys capisce yes got that very important a lot of people unfortunately missed that you know a lot of people just don't know they have a bunch of projects but they don't know those core concepts including these ones you know yep so make sure you guys learn that really really well now here's week six what you need to do learn algorithms in javascript okay so this is going to be things like you need to you should learn bigo notation iterations recursions sorting methods and just going back oh thank you for a five dollar donation for con really appreciate it um let me just go back to the right one week six okay and these algorithms like recursions and recursions and sorting methods it's like it sounds complicated but like if i gave you an array like a bucket full of numbers can you sort them in the right order recursions you know it allows you to do like if i have if i had a game like a maze game could you solve the maze with your like can you create a bot that can figure out the maze and how to get out of there and if you could solve that then one day maybe you could work with tesla and i don't know if you guys know but but now is my um you know he he showed me he can just press a button and his tesla car will actually drive itself out of the parking lot and towards him so how does it navigate its way out of these other cars like zigs and zags out of every other vehicle's way and stops at his footstep i mean that is absolutely mindblowing but that also is using concepts like recursions or iterations and uh algorithms at the end of the day okay so it's just a simplistic i'm overly simplifying it but this hopefully gives you an idea of why you need to learn these things exactly exactly okay um with that said let's go on to what will be covered in week seven or what you should do in week seven as you're going through becomes the fun stuff guys the fun stuff we got react.js guys okay react just 101. now what does this mean right this means you'll be learning things like components right you'll be learning things like right how to pace how to like how to how to pass and data from one component to another component right and then today you know you need to learn the basics of react.js right and this is actually one of the funnest things you probably will get into as you become a front developer yes that's absolutely right react.js is going to be a really fun part but give yourself the treat when you deserve it after doing all the good boy and good girl things earlier okay don't give yourself the treat of react.js too early because trust me what's going to happen is you're going to start tripping over because you're going too fast all right uh so react.js right you will need to learn jsx so write that down this is basically your writing html um in javascript exactly functional components so you'll learn how to actually you know write functional components versus classbased components in the old days it was mostly classbased now functional functional looks way easier it's way easier to understand in my opinion and if you don't think about components guys by the way components are like little things right like who can tell me actually zoom chat what are components to you what components do you know we built that app for the uber clone right we have the components like for example the map was a component right yeah it's little blocks of code you can just put in anywhere you want so for example a fun component can be like a navbar it can be a component a sidebar can be a component a news feed can be a component um you know social icons that are underneath the post can all be one component the common section can be one component so you can think of things like building blocks or legos when i think of components i think of legos and when you put them together you get an app exactly exactly okay beautiful props you'll need to learn about that it's going to be important states so good job somebody said in the comments below you'll need to learn states you'll need to learn react hooks okay how do they work you'll need things use effect right the ones that we use right to be able to initially for example when you load a page and let's just say you go to facebook and you want to load you want to see all the posts well facebook is going to use like a react hook like use effect right use effect to be able to you load all these posts right after you load the page does that make sense guys yeah good and virtual dom is a concept that react introduced which essentially goes to you know um without being too technical and instead of like manipulating the real dom you manipulate a virtual dom which essentially just means you do things blazing fast okay and and react allows you to do that um cool now what you should do in this week which is i believe week seven in your week seven what you should do is build a todo list app that looks somewhat similar to this this design is from frontend mentor and i don't know would you guys agree that this todo list app looks freaking wonderful it's a lot mad better to list than what i used to build yeah so like build give yourself a project like this by the seventh week to do this let me ask you would you guys be excited if you were in your seventh week of learning coding and you were to build a project like this would that be exciting to you yeah i mean even that the clock app which was like week three week four like would that be exciting to you to build all those projects already like starting your week three big four because guys that is possible yes and i'm saying you'll be building this from scratch right not you're just watching a tutorial and copying it the goal is by week seven you should be able to build something like this from scratch bushrust says yes pedro says yes let's go yes yes yes yeah tons of people okay so week eight uh here's the plan rebuild the clock app but this time using react js so this will show you how you go from pure javascript to react and why you'll never go to pure javascript ever again because react just makes your life so much easier honestly yeah yeah yeah so rebuild this app in week eight week nine combine javascript and react and build a weather app with react.js that also has an api okay so this weather app you can make it look like this and it's pulling weather from a nearby location and whichever location i should pick like birmingham or manchester new york it should immediately change the weather just showing what's how many degrees it is outside what city is it uh and then whether it's cloudy or not with an icon right and then over here i can actually even search a location and type it in okay so take a screenshot of this project i'll give you guys five seconds to do that because this can be a good project for you to build in week eight and put on your portfolio late guys how cool does this look give us some fire if you think this looks amazing just like imagine imagine the recruiter who looked at your portfolio and saw this application right or saw this project on your portfolio right i mean even all the projects that we've included in here and they saw it like okay this person is serious they're not here to kid around they're not a joke around they are here to build amazing things would you agree with me on that one yeah i think so yeah i think if i saw your first project with your todo list and this one i mean it's it really speaks volumes of your design and honestly one thing i had a conversation with somebody earlier and it's like your design skills are so important when it comes to front end developer world because you could be so freaking good and react but if your design looks really terrible you won't even get a chance for them to look into your code and see all the cool complex stuff that you're doing exactly all right so this is from dribble let's move on uh week 10 build a restaurant app with react.js so you can have a restaurant oh first of all this looks freaking awesome this is one of my favorite types of designs i love these types of designs they're so cool yeah and this actually comes from dribble too and if you guys search up if you go guys go to dribble.com you search up any for example website right may that be like a weather app or you search up you know like a restaurant app they'll pull up so many means designers you can use them just for inspiration just like this and if you create it like oh my god it looks so good yeah this is beautiful so build something like this in week 10 all right this is going to be a good thing that you guys can build uh 12 weeks in total is the game plan that we're showing you somebody just ask week 11 we're up to week 11 now you're very close to becoming a frontend developer okay and starting to even apply to jobs at this point as a junior developer but you can build an amazon clone with react.js so at this point honestly you should be able to do it by yourself but if you're not you can watch our videos on it as well and this is the amazon clone we want you to build because the actual amazon clone too many people have built it um i think if you build something like this this is super modern it's freaking cool it looks better i would say so it looks way better honestly and it just makes you stand out yeah yeah like i mean yeah like if i saw it as a recruiter again it's like holy moly like if i imagine you actually applying to amazon right with this project you're like yo amazon check out what i did right you guys should listen to me you know okay i think they'll be like okay they're like actually yeah you do the redesign i'm gonna leave thank you yeah exactly so bill yeah so build something like this in your week 11 and this project here i freaking promise you like this recruiter see this they are gonna hit you up for a interview they see this they want to go look deeper into your code and give you a chance for an interview so these are massive projects we've had so many people put projects like these on their portfolios and actually get interviews and then get jobs you still need to have skills to show when you're at the interview which our goal is that if you do all of this right by week 11 you'll have those skills okay but at least you got the interview right that's one of the hardest things to get just in general guys right yeah to get the interview right you want to get noticed first and then then you have to worry about the other problems which is okay how do i pass the interview yeah that's yeah that's a whole different problem okay and week 12 is essentially you should do job hunting in that week all right so in that week you should like be looking at what other job opportunities are out there what types of things you can do we're showing one of our students nasir he's 16 years old and i think like this is a really good example to show you guys because he's 16 he's not even in america he's in pakistan so the opportunity to be able to get jobs are paid is even way harder out there right and he has made over 12 thousand dollars freelancing and using his react and django skills to be able to land jobs like that's pretty freaking cool and as soon as you guys think by the way and now he's actually in the zoom click on the j gonna bring him on as well oh yeah if he wants to jump on real quick here he is right here oh he's here nice that's what i'm saying he's here okay bring him on hello what is up nick looking beautiful we are doing amazing so nasir just like i guess share with us you know uh what have you like what did you do and how were you able to actually generate income from coding at such a young age i think everybody wants to know that and are you even 16 i thought you were 15 or something i thought you were yeah last year you were you were making an income even at 15 right i remember that that's amazing so nasir thank you so much for jumping on bro i appreciate you we might bring you on a little bit later as well because we just want to make sure i keep providing value to everybody that was here but guys how cool was this story of nasir's if you thought it was cool either give me a thumbs up or something or drop some fire in the chat is that inspiring to you guys like to see like somebody who just kind of to get started and right away start making money and actually changing could have a complete new career yes damn it's a lot of fires lots of suppliers coming through so thank you nasir for sharing all of that i mean but what i want to do a disclaimer i know how hard this kid works and he's a gogetter and he doesn't make excuses so great job on that this year and now guys the moment we've been waiting for for this long are y'all ready can we share this with you i don't think they're ready i don't think they're ready man okay awesome they're like yes let's go all right guys here we go we're about to reveal the top secret we've been so freaking excited about this and introducing profit with react guys this is a brand new course that we have just launched okay um and essentially profit with react is a selfpaced course and is designed to help you learn the skills you need to become a frontend developer within seven weeks now before i continue is it okay if i can share more about this program with you guys to have your permission for that can i get a thumbs up guys can we get a thumbs up can i get a high five yes yes beautiful dakota's like let's go dakota anthony's excited okay beautiful okay thank you so i'm gonna i'm gonna keep rocking and rolling here so here's what you guys get in profit with react and you know uh it's seven modules of react.js and it covers what we were showing you guys to cover in 12 weeks the goal is to jam pack that into seven weeks so you can even get those results faster now keep in mind you'll have to work hard right to be able to make up for that time since it's not 12 weeks or seven weeks but if you could have those skills in seven weeks would that be exciting to you guys yes or no yes god this is not for those this is not for those who want to sit down lay down watch netflix so they know it is for those who work hard right and if you do work hard you will get the result it's just it's just i think it's simple down it's like yeah i mean i will probably get into my story at some point if you guys are ever interested but like yeah i when i started coding and picked it up i worked my goddamn face off uh to learn the skill it was brutal but it was worth it at the end so how this will work guys this course it's going to be a preorder of this course okay so this course will start in december 8th okay december 8th is when the official start date will be and then every module for the next seven weeks will be dripped out to you does that make sense give me a thumbs up if that makes sense anthony says yes dakota says yes cool that's right that way you guys get excited every single day everything is there's something new right you guys like oh what's coming up next then what's coming up next you know so guys now on top of that here's what makes this course a banger above any other course you're gonna find on udemy or anywhere online this course comes with seven weeks of coaching as well so from the time you join the course you're gonna also have seven weeks of group coaching with the crew that you're gonna be with so you're all gonna be getting trained at the same freaking time okay and everybody's gonna be just as hungry as you are so you're gonna be in a community of absolute winners and gogetters and there are a ton of people in our community who take these skills and then start applying it start landing jobs and those are the people you'll be connected to guys this is not your regular udemy course it's not your regular any course in terms of like you just watch the videos and you follow along no right you have to you have to come to the coaching goals there will be that with people who will be pressuring you to make sure you do come so there's accountability yeah right of course then you have to actually build the projects right so it's a lot more than just your normal course you watch the videos and i'm sure raise your hand guys if you're kind of sick of that you're sick of those ones where it's just like you watch a bunch of videos and you don't want to keep doing that anymore yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah so that's the goal to give you that accountability that support that you keep showing up and you keep getting the skills if you get stuck you have a community and instructors around to help you out okay um so and these coaching calls will also be starting on december 8th for you okay now this course is designed to help you learn the skills to become a frontend developer that's the goal of it and we want to give you the skills you need to be able to go get a job that's always 100 our goal with any program or any course we ever launch yes knowledge here is the value guys the more knowledgeable you are guys the more value you want the more value what the more value you have exactly yep absolutely now in this program you're going to be learning everything from scratch right you're going to be mastering react you're going to learn things like npm what the heck is react router and how does that work you know master things like redux you're going to master things like firebase and versailles and how to deploy and of course you're going to be mastering the other things we've shown you as well html css javascript because those things are very very important for you to learn all the building blocks that we just talked about guys right the bottom lines that we talked about which are really really important those who do need them you will be learning them as well absolutely and we're also going to be having you build some fire projects in this course so there's some projects i'm going to list out right now and then there's some projects we might just drop as a surprise bonus for you all but check it out you're going to be building an epic realtime chat app kind of like what's app okay and we're going to be going deep into how to make it work and just make it absolutely amazing but how this is going to be more different than any youtube tutorial on it out there is we're going to break it up into projects and stepbystep exercises for you so when you build this you completely build it yourself by completing tons of exercises not just by watching a youtube video and like copying the code and now you've built it does that make sense guys yeah that makes sense now i want to just copy a bunch of a bunch of code raise your hand i'm really curious yeah that's right right so it's like our goal is very important it's very important right copying code is good but it's not what's going to teach you right a lot of our students a lot of like people students that i know who just copy code and then they just end up kind of like when they are faced with the real problems with the real you know world coding problems they have a harder time so our goal is to put you right there in the driver's seat yep to make sure you're actually coding there with us and actually brainstorming and problem solving too absolutely okay absolutely you're also going to be building an amazing project another amazing project which is close to my heart because i love i absolutely love chess any second that i get for free i am like finding ways to play chess so in this i'm going to be putting my heart and soul for you guys and having us build a multiplayer chess app and i think this project will actually have you step above the crowd so much because it's a unique project not everybody's going to have this on their portfolio and it shows some incredible skills of yours like how do you actually have multiplayer game with react because most people don't show you that right yeah this is going to be the the thing that actually wows the recruiters right yeah like that's you know it's all cool you know it's all fun and games to build these projects who are like landing pages and stuff like that but when you get to interact with multiple people and you have multiple technologies like react router like react gs right and firebase even right that's when it really makes you kind of think differently and it really puts you above everybody else on their critics side absolutely and with this project you guys are going to be doing react you're going to be mastering react router firebase even howler gs which is a sound library because when each move happens it makes a sound when you checkmate that makes a sound how do you detect if it's a check i mean there's a lot and plus if you don't know how to play chess you'll even learn how to play chess in this okay which is going to open up a whole new world for you and you can challenge me at any point you want and and this also has a crazy amount of other things like user authentication you can log in you can see who the user you're playing against is it goes deep so i'm excited for you guys to see this you're also going to be building an amazing todo app which is going to use react redux style components and things like that so those projects are going to be learning and putting it on your portfolio as well on top of that you're going to be getting an awesome exclusive slack community so you guys see in the chats right now you guys are all talking engaging you see all the amazing faces that are around you these are the faces and the hungry and the ambitious people that you're going to be seeing inside of this community as well yes what's the problem guys raise your hand guys if you feel something's alone when you're coding well raise your hand if you feel like alone when you're trying to learn this because this is not an easy field to feel exactly everybody right it's not an easy field to be in right it's very complicating right complicated it is very confusing sometimes right and there's a lot of people trying to do it right and when you try to first start out you might feel like you're just by yourself and so it might even discourage you but versus raise your hand if you agree with me if you have a group of people who have the same goals who are trusted driven to push you attached to it as well would you do it then raise your hand yes yes yes exactly ton of hands that's the difference guys you have all those people with you supporting you you're gonna crush your goals it becomes simple at that point so you're gonna have a community like this inside of slack every day people are gonna be there jumping in talking you know coming up with ideas sharing with you everything that they're learning you're gonna be sharing the stuff that you're learning you guys are gonna be making progress together right and then the coaching calls whenever they're happening we'll also drop in the times for you guys so you can jump into those calls now with all of that said the other thing that we're going to be giving you guys with this is 30 day money back guarantee okay and the point of this is we don't want you to risk anything either you love the course or you get your money back okay hopefully that makes sense to you guys we want to just make that super simple cool guys so guys if on 29th day 59th hour 59th minute 29 seconds you're like no no no no no don't worry you guys get your money back but most but we we have so much confidence in that right because we always our kids to provide a ton of value and we know you guys will love it just in the end absolutely and guys we will i mean you're going to be surprised by what things we're offering you but i'm going to keep going through this okay now guys there's tons of amazing testimonials that we have from clever programmer from our previous courses i mean ingrid went on to make over 50 000 a year just teaching her frontend coding skills you know we had jen who went from you know being laid off due to the pandemic working as a junior developer making forty six thousand dollars a year to after going through a course doubling her income at ninety six thousand dollars a year as a senior react developer i mean yeah she literally built one of the projects like we built like this coveted tracker project right together with everybody and she used that project as you know as a for her portfolio and really now when she got off the coaching call she calls me right right off the couch she's like nos guess what i got the job no way i'm like what she's like and guess what they told me they loved my project and the emphasis on that clover tracker was the reason i pretty much got the job so i'm like what that's crazy but yeah she really you know she's amazing person just in general but i'm really happy for her yeah so that's those are the results that this program is bringing for students okay now just to recap guys here's what you're gonna get okay this is gonna be a completely beginner friendly course you're gonna have seven react js training modules seven total react coaching calls and all of these calls will be delivered to you weekly okay so for seven weeks you're gonna have access to exclusive slack community you're going to build real world projects like a realtime messaging app you're going to build a chess game all of these projects are going to be portfolio ready that you'll be able to slap onto your portfolio um and guess what that's not all we're gonna make it better for you guys okay we're gonna make it a lot better i love that sound sting so here's what we're gonna be doing we have a pretty ridiculous bonus for the people who joined during this call this will not be happening after this call let me show you uh this is the most insane deal we've ever offered and we're just excited because we want to give people the chance for everybody who's been so loyal for the five days like you know anthony you've been showing up brother dakota like eduardo fabio sam you know sam sehar dirk like all of you guys luna like if i didn't mention any of you i'd been seeing you guys over the five days you guys are hardcore fans so we wanted to give you guys something special okay um and in the next 30 minutes only actually scratch that in the next 20 minutes only okay here's what we're going to be doing as a bonus here's what you're going to get profit with javascript that's right that's right so you guys get two courses basically yep so profit exactly so you're going to be getting profit with javascript guys this is our mega flagship course we've launched it over the last two years we have thousands of students enrolled in this program absolutely love it their minds were blown with the value and this is over 13 modules of training okay and this goes deep into javascript so if you guys were like hey do we also get to learn javascript and master those skills before we move on to react this this course will help you master that in so much detail it's insane and what this will do is that one month you're waiting after you preorder the profit of the react course you'll be able to go through and master react in that master javascript in that time so then when you get to react you're going to be so much stronger in your foundational understanding of everything that's happening does that make sense guys yes so guys who here still needs to learn those foundations right who feel that they still need to learn those foundations right so if you that's what you need guys right this is going to be it right this is going to teach you all those bare bones nasir is actually part of this right how do you think he got to where he is today right he was part of those these courses courses like these yeah mar was a pro part of this course and she started making 96 thousand dollars a year nasir was in grid was as well that we showed you exactly it's an amazing community right and so you guys will get to be part of that community which also includes things like coaching calls right and so forth so maybe you can talk a little bit more about that and check this out guys so here you have four to five projects that you're going to be building inside of profit with javascript itself so you're gonna be building your own blog app a blackjack app you're gonna build a twitter app you're gonna build a google maps store locator and you'll even be building your own chrome extension and you'll be deploying it to chrome that's right you actually have your own chrome app it's crazy i have a lot of students who built it and put it literally on the chrome chrome app store and people are actually using it the chrome app that we built you know like the first one that i built to teach you guys right literally is being used by i think the last time i checked and don't quote me on this one i think it's like 400 people or something right that downloaded it it was pretty crazy and so you guys get to build that too oh really yeah yeah it's like there's a lot of users and there's a lot of five stars too as well oh snap i want to actually take a look at it after this it's called the rocket planner if you guys are interested it's called the rocket planner that's nice so you guys can even look that up and then at the end of this right you guys are going to see react gs101 so if you watch this and go through that module it'll really help you be prepped and ready uh for when you get into the profit of the reactor on december 8th okay yeah okay actually i looked into it this rocket planner has a thousand plus users right now wow on the comment website plus yeah a thousand plus users right now yeah that's insane that and and they all went through this course to find out about it right or did something i mean people just people found out about about people who wanted wow that's absolutely incredible okay maybe after this slides we can even show that so yeah you guys will have really solid understanding of everything guys i highly recommend that you don't miss out on this seriously it's gonna cost you another this course is 700 this will cost you another 700 to join and i promise you a ton of people are gonna pay that and join that in the next day when they miss it today so i don't want you to miss that today okay that's why i'm just like going hard at it showing it to you guys and making sure you guys understand so here's more about profit with javascript it has 13 modules so we showed you these are available now these are already out so while you're waiting for profit to react you're hungry you're like man i can't wait for this thing to come out jump in dive in eat eat your buffet all you can eat that's what's going to be here with you for javascript now this is designed to help you learn the javascript part that that will allow you to learn the react.js part at a very deep level okay it is the foundation level to get you to the react.js portion got it does that make sense guys it's the first thing you need to learn to get to react to yes yes okay so profit with javascript this program is worth 700 by itself all right profit with react is going to be worth 700 so both of these programs are going to be worth how much who's really good at math here 700 plus 700 is what guys this is this is going to be a value of roughly around 1400 if you want to be technical is going to be 1394 but around 1400 of value but if you preorder profit with react in the next 20 minutes so i'm going to start the timer all right i'm going to start the timer here and i'm going to hit start all right there we go the timer has started if you preorder it in the next 20 minutes you're gonna get the bundle of profit with javascript 13 plus modules and profit with react with the seven coaching calls not for fourteen hundred dollars but for 3.97 damn this offer is only available for the next 19 minutes and 30 seconds left after these 20 minutes here's what's gonna happen the price is going to go up to 497 immediately after this okay we're only offering this for you guys who are watching this live and the bundle is going to go away in 18 in 19 minutes and about 15 seconds now okay that bundle is going to go away so then you have to get profit with the react by itself for 497 and the profit with javascript uh by itself for 700. exactly so guys i'm really curious guys if you guys are fired up and i'm interested in potentially joining something like this in learning react they coming from developer guys i want to see that fire in the zoom chats right now so i want to see that fire in the zoom chats right now if you guys are able well can they chat right now with me i think maybe i'm not sure if they can chat i think we'll put the chat in the pause for now just so you guys can see the links okay oh good oh good oh good oh good that's right so if you guy oh yeah there we go a lot of fire peter's pumped up let's go let's go let's go beautiful so guys go ahead do that and once you join the course we're gonna bring you on the zoom live and i'm going to ask you like what made you join this as well so keep in mind guys you're going to be saving a thousand dollars if you make the decision in the next 17 minutes and 50 seconds i think that's what the time is left now um if you guys want right if you want it to be easier for you and if you're like hey paying the whole thing is a little bit tricky uh you're gonna have to pay a little bit more if you go payment plan but here's how that works it's going to be 160 payments and three payments of 160 okay so if you want a payment plan option you can do that as well we have dropped it in the chat for you so you all can see that's right so you guys go just go into zoom chat the links are all there right i'm really curious can i get a raise of hands anybody who's interested at all anybody who's ever literally hey beautiful beautiful beautiful let's go okay beautiful awesome um so guys yeah these are the students that have gone incredible results working with us right this is what we do and we would love to help you inside of this program we try to make it as cost effective as possible especially considering it comes with group coaching calls right most boot camps for that will charge you way more but we wanted to make it something that's affordable for everybody exactly we actually have a lot a few students here who actually can talk a little bit about more about their experiences too yeah yeah definitely that's awesome so yeah i think let's bring on some of the students and hear their stories but just going over this guys get the course bundle for 397. we've shown you what you get beginner friendly you get 13 javascript training modules you build five projects with javascript and react you

all right who do we have that we want to bring on and should we continue on this year who who did it who came on the last time just continue on with him do you we do we have uh dina on right now oh do we do let me see let me see let me see he's asking but yeah guys so i just want to share with you guys the results that the students have gotten and i want to kind of go through it for you guys right so dina she joined our program and she came out as a frontend react js developer and now she went from you know her previous job where she was making ten to fifteen thousand dollars a year to now making forty thousand dollars a year right we had joshua who recently actually graduated from one of our programs and he got a job as a friend and engineer he blockchain startup um and this startup is called teller so that was super cool um and i got on a call with him recently and i learned so much about blockchain i was like yo i'm mind blown he's a really cool guy yeah we showed you guys ingrid right we have ajit who landed a full stack developer job for 72 000 a year i think was it in canada um i don't remember but i think either in canada or u.s but he landed a job as a full stack developer yeah he's not he's in the pwg community by the way oh wow yeah that's perfect and then we have on who landed a job for 70 000 a year at gravity payments as a full stack developer um and yeah the list goes on we have gen we have devin who landed a job for 107. it's now 7 000 at paypal and uh we have dave lueck who's even on this call so great job dave for landing a job for over 100k let's

jamal hafiz dakota o'reilly who's on this call albert who was on this call anastasia alejandro navier who's on this call armand willis eduardo who's on this call chris anupe arthur leela sonya

honestly at this rate they're probably gonna run out tomorrow um not even until november 12th honestly yeah by the way guys those of you asking like why is it you know cost more if you pay than 160 you know for three months it's because you get this kind of people paying full that's just as simple as that right so if you fully get a discount if you're paying in three months of course it's just a little more expensive that's it yes okay cool um derrick uh dirk says i'm in it beautiful yeah when you pay in full yeah you you save more um that's the whole idea okay exactly exactly all right and also i have a few people as well who joined from um from youtube as well like muhammad for example you joined welcome welcome welcome my friend so many amazing people uh godfrey level says i'm trying to draw my cards can't decline it's all good just keep trying my friend okay if somebody's having trouble uh send a text message to this number over here uh send a text message here i dropped it in

welcome i'm doing great i'll do a quick little story to tell um like early 2007. you know me and my innocent daughters give it up that is freaking awesome that's cute okay go for it um i'm ready so what makes you excited about what makes you excited about this like path i'm guessing is my question um all the new platforms have different um stuff like i didn't know about redox and all those uh firebase and when i built my app so now that i have an opportunity to learn those items i'll be able to be more dangerous sir you will be you'll become really dangerous that's the goal with this program um in seven weeks we'll make you i mean as dangerous as like any best program out there so we're going to give you that you just promised us your hard work and and we got you oh i'm doing nighttime security sometimes so i mean yeah i can see i can see i can see you got that badge right there yeah that's amazing bro my my both of my brothers and my dad did security as well in chicago and i was gonna do it at like 16 years old i was gonna start getting into security but like right when i was about to start applying for security jobs i got a job that was like hey do you want to teach chess and get paid and i was like sure that sounds fun uh this is a really funny yeah uh situation but thank you henry i didn't know you're going to do security that's interesting really oh yeah i was going to do security i was going to like get a i like thought it would be so cool to have the gun or whatever i'm like man it's going to be cool nobody's going to mess it up anymore beautiful

exactly what we're going to be doing bro we're going to walk you guys through that exact path and we're gonna even supercharge it and make it faster for y'all super duper charge it yeah amazing hearing that i wanna i'm gonna unmute sean as well at the same time uh sean tell me what what made you pull the trigger on this call man well i wanted to land a job as a developer right now i am a certified at pharmacy technician okay right now i think it's time for me to change my job where are your cvs where do you work cvs no i work at a store okay with my older brother okay so basically i've been starting coding last in like 2000 technically i started coding before 2020 but ever since it i have more time to start coding and i first learned sql was my first language technically and then i started focus and i started doing python and c plus but then after that i start focusing on javascript but as of right now i need to start strengthening my projects start working with people and start doing my portfolio and make it as good uh sean keep working really hard in this program keep building the projects that are going to be there um one thing i'm going to tell you is i'm committed to getting as many people to quit from pharmacy work and get the developer work as possible it started with my friend one of my best friends in life his name is tenzin and i remembered i spent like six months trying to convince him to quit his pharmacy job at cvs oh yeah he told me yeah and then finally one day he quit and then he uh you know we just we were just coding together every single day years and years and years ago and then he finally got a job as a developer and then we were both on pace to be making six figures um but yeah and then he started his youtube channel called what's dev i don't know if you guys know him uh but what's dev was his channel so sean thank you so much for sharing um sharing everything you've shared brother i'm gonna hear from dakota now um what is up dakota hey what's going on bro nice to have you in what made you pull the trigger and join honestly um i've been debating for the last few this is my fifth year and i still have another year after this semester so i'm going to be halfway through the sixth year wow i even graduate uh and i don't even know hardly anything for what i'm actually going for i'm going for game design and development and i've had like maybe four or five classes in five years that have taught me anything related to my degree i've actually learned more web design uh or ui design or whatever then i have game design wow what i'm actually saying you know so i've originally was just gonna learn html css to build a portfolio but uh now i'm really getting into it i just i want to learn more and i want to learn javascript and react.js and all these web technologies for front end development uh and an internship by next summer hopefully um so that way i can have that on my portfolio and maybe start some freelance work as well smart man very smart very yeah it's so true a lot of students unfortunately you know do not get the education they they want when they go to you know university right i'm not trying to bring down universities right but like to me like i went to university as well but honestly like what i know today is not what i learned from university right like there are some aspects there are some good teachers that i did love there were like one or two classes that were really good for me right but most of classes like i was learning c plus you know and like some java and that's pretty much it right but there's like new technologies which is like like i was learning like like git but it wasn't even get you know what i mean like the old kit right before you became kid it was crazy like why do we need to learn this right but yeah unfortunately you know just it's harder for some types of universities to keep up with it with you know the new technologies that's it yeah yeah i'm kind of lucky that the school that i go to is very cheap i went to kind of a local school but it's a satellite of a bigger university so i'm only paying like maybe five thousand dollars a semester uh so it's not too bad but i mean it could have been way worse i'm just not learning what i wanted to learn and now i'm starting to get into i really want to learn it more beautiful well well excited to have you here dakota my friend would you tell those people who are looking to join or maybe are not sure about what would you tell them i tell them honestly go ahead and join it's so much cheaper than college don't do what i did don't spend five thousand dollars a semester spend three hundred dollars or four hundred dollars now yeah beautiful guys 60 spots left 40 spots got taken right on this call that's crazy and so just make sure if y'all are interested that you jump in now rather than later so all the spots don't get booked out um with that said i mean at this point i think uh what's best to do is we'll take any questions you guys have maybe there might be some last minute questions you guys have okay yeah uh and so i'll i'll jump we'll jump into that so if you have any questions start raising your hands and uh um and we'll start bringing you on yeah let me see if you guys have any questions just let us know okay let us know i lowered everybody's hand because i was assuming they were from the past yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right yeah cool looks like albert had a question uh but you have a question yes yeah yeah it looks like you have a question go ahead albert uh yeah um yeah um i'm gonna be uh probably getting a job in uh as an electrician like a electrician apprentice uhhuh uh maybe maybe in a month nice um i don't know when i'm job searching right now um but that's like you know like my fulltime thing but it's like a gig just until i become a programmer sure yeah yeah um when was the i know i know the program profit we react to selfpaced yes when was the when when did it start again december so december 8th it'll start and then it'll come out every week like one module every single week it's going to drip out for seven weeks okay okay and in the meantime in the meantime while that's happened you guys have proper javascript right that was a bonus but you'll kind of start learning right that's going to be your base foundations that you need to start to learn got it and then there you go you have a lot of projects as well a lot of amazing community too right i don't think i have profit i i don't think i have profit with javascript when i when i bought profit with react reactor said do you want to buy java so so what's going to be happening for everybody that joined so that's what's going to be happening with everybody who didn't join on this call they're going to need to buy profit with javascript but for you all that joined we're going to we're doing a special deal so uh manually our customer support team will start giving you guys access to profit with javascript okay all the the 40 people that joined on this call and um one more thing um i know it's selfpaced so after seven and just want to say one thing for anybody that joined make sure you book that call that's very important because we're going to go through the full onboarding experience with you guys we're going to get you set up in the program you're literally going to get like 300 percent more like access and better results by going through that okay so that's usually what we see and that person is also going to become your accountability coach so make sure you book that onboarding call got it guys good and uh after seven weeks could we still go at it if we're doing selfpaced yes like you have a job okay yeah okay thank you you got it brother thank

lueck wants to come on too so let's uh i'll put him on a spotlight melissa can you please turn on your camera so i can't knew you because i think otherwise it's really hard for me to let me go oh there she is hold on let's go hey let's i [Laughter] i don't like those chest tables with the chest thing i'd i'd rather have to roll up like the actual board downstairs to do tournaments uh melissa tell us like how you know after joining clever programmer like how do you feel like your coding skills for you have changed um i have gotten a billion times better even in the last few months and honestly my confidence has changed because i came into this not really knowing anything like i barely even know how to use my computer you don't believe me ask robin and like just learning like everything and kind of doing it like on my own time like because i started in uh javascript so being able to just kind of start online but then when i got like a little bit better i was like okay i need better coaching so that's when i joined the big boot camp and uh yeah it kicked my butt but i'm getting joining the prophet with react is that correct yes yes beautiful i'm excited for you we're excited yes yeah i would love to have you in there and uh yeah i mean we love melissa we love your energy and even when we did the javascript tour you were there for javascript there was only like 20 of us yeah we're done melissa we're doing the react intensive online now from the 19th of november to 21st so i'm sure we're gonna have we already have a few people like four or five people signed up for it uh we're probably gonna have a couple of more people coming through joining the react intensive but you should let the people in the boot camp know about the react intensive definitely yeah i'll tell you robin too okay she can spread it she also has other things those people who are considering getting into this course what would you tell them join now it will make you so much better and the teachers will kick your vet and make sure you're on your game yeah you're gonna like they definitely make sure you're on top of this and if you're falling behind they make [Laughter] i'm looking forward to the next uh go to uh go to uh machine code app that you you yeah uh let's i'm gonna have uh hey melissa all right melissa thank you so much see you later byebye dave i'm trying to unmute him i got you we're doing amazing now i'm doing better now that i see your face dave i will say um occurs 40 salary increase in three weeks let's go that makes me happy um how do you consult like hello hello world i think that's always the starting point right how do you feel like when you know of course you know why do you think education is important to you in general well we're in this field here today exactly that's a really good point that's a really good point yeah yeah it's always about learning like of course the more skills you learn the more you earn you know people say that right and i'm a big believer that you know who you know in this world right knowing a lot of different skills not specifically is going to be the most important thing right yes you know we always say learn one thing first and then of course expand from that but you know nowadays people are learning and react and moving on from that right so the more you learn the more fundamentals you know um i think the more valuable you just become and then and then at that point like you know employers look at you and you're like like we just need you and that's it you know yeah absolutely i mean i've been doing full stack for for 10 years like i said before you got to learn the basics you can't build it's like trying to build the roof yes before you put the house up before you put the laws up the foundation that's right these guys will start to add the foundation dave very very basic all the way to the advance dave thank you so much for sharing that brother i'm gonna bring on pencey um and let's actually bring on armand as well armand as well uh yo guys come on let's go armand uh what it what is up hi let's start off with pencey how are you doing pencey good good amazing am i saying your name right yeah i'm sorry um just feels so good i don't know i like your style so thank you but tell tell us you know what brings you to private react um so i i was in a boot camp um i don't want to mention the name but um it was you know it was a good experience but like i just felt like i needed more um the lesson i just didn't feel like it was really really rushed in um i didn't really take much value um so i was basically doing things on my own researching researching things on my own and trying to you know um you know talk to other students in the slack community um but everyone was just you know working on their own thing you know yeah um to reach out with instructors but like you know everyone was just like hey i'm just worked up like for that reason and then you're just like i don't know what to do but so i just had to wing it the whole time um i graduated but like i don't know like a lot of things a lot of things like there's like a lot of things you guys mentioned and i don't know it no a lot of students that i know as well who came back at these other boot camps right as well like you know one of our students but on came from a different boot camp actually you know also like when he graduate i'm not gonna name that name as well but he graduated too like he felt like he you know didn't really learn much right so yeah right he felt like he just wasn't ready and so we actually taught him those fundamentals that he needed to learn and that's how he actually got you know a job of gravity payments that at this point actually i know he said 70k she now pays in 93k i actually talked to him recently what the hell yeah he actually gets paid 93 he get a bonus he got he got a raise now yeah so i talked to him like about i think two weeks ago actually yeah but yeah it's i totally don't understand that so we're excited to have you here and thank you so much for joining and what would you tell those people who are potentially thinking about you know joining something like this i think they should go for it because if they want if they're hungry to learn how to you know make a websites or web applications for it pencey can i ask you something um oh fabio says when i'm done with the program will you give me a job at cleverprogrammer if you're really really good and you're a good human that's right you know i just want to ask you like you you talk to me about your coding bootcamp what makes you feel like what makes you take a chance on this right because if i'm you i'm a little scared at this point because man i just invested so much in a coding boot camp so now this is a risk for me what made you what made you take a chance on this what makes you took a chance on us because you teach well that's the whole thing if the experience is well you teach well yeah you're gonna you're gonna do well you're gonna you don't understand you better grasp everything you're gonna understand like you go things step by step um you are able to teach us you don't you you're just not like slapping things and then like here it's like learning yeah take this yeah you just it's um more like i feel like it's more real real world projects yeah um so yeah and where did you test the teaching experience was it the uber challenge were you here for the whole uber challenge yeah yeah okay amazing like very you know precise and like you know like why did you put this component and why did you do this and like i really loved the fact that like you were showing us um the readymade like uh you know um design i guess i would say yeah like um the back button and then like you know you gotta put the um you know this is a container this is another routine yeah i didn't i i didn't learn that like you know it's basically like the framework like you need to know the framework first as a designer i didn't learn that like so i think that's really important oh wow hear that yeah yeah thank you so much for sharing that and on youtube we just got a 15 donation so thank you so much for that huge shout out wow that's amazing thank you so much though i don't know yeah it's a good one uh okay armand how are you doing brother hopefully i'm saying your name right uh talk to us you know what made you join the program brother let me just can i actually good to see you my friend it's been a while in the world okay how can i make money from the engineering career they didn't quite panic for me and when i saw these guys i was like hey you know they went through a whole lot of loops and figured out a way to make money with coding which you know they don't quite teach this stuff in college so i'm like yeah i could see the value you know coming from this program and uh seeing a whole lot of testimonies just gave me an encouragement to really believe in this program so that's where i joined beautiful bro that makes that makes me really happy and just talk to me like what has your experience been with coding so far in the you know like how long have you been coding or or been exposed to it uh well it started with my first programming class in college and i like that how i can take my ideas and code it up and make my program work are we going back a couple of years or is that a couple of months yeah we're probably talking like five years back but i haven't really been consistent with coding yes uh throughout that time but when i came to know you guys that's where i got really curious and how long how long ago was that how long ago did you come across us uh about two years uh okay nice man wow that's been a long time that's why nas has just probably started with us around that time yeah oh me oh yeah that's right actually about two years ago probably start with you guys yeah that's right early 2019. um yeah wow man that's incredible so you've been watching the stuff you've been watching you know uh probably our videos and then what made you join this challenge i mean it's been two years right like we've been talking about profit with javascript for like years so what made you decide to like at least even join the challenge this time around well you know um i follow this quote that my mentor tells me that you can't walk into a bright new future being your same old self so if i wanted to get those advances if i wanted to give myself a raise i love that i love the dedication my friend that's good that's good yeah the certification when i first got a call with you yeah so yeah i'm excited for you my friend wow amazing thank you for sharing that brother appreciate it um yeah we had luna had a question do you have questions right yeah i just wanted to quickly just to make sure because i know this is one of the biggest things when i very first joined when reach out to me to talk to me kind of making me feel welcome and i always want to make sure that that energy is already being given so if you guys ever have questions while you're still waiting for things to start reach out in the general chat reach out to either myself like there's so much that happens with different people it's gonna be someone available yeah and i think that's really really freaking cool if you ever have those questions please

successful i really was thinking about that let me make sure to tell you guys especially yeah that's 100 true thank you for sharing that luna really appreciate you thank you so much thank you so much

just said they're gonna clip that moment where you called us both nazis [Laughter] oh man here comes a new video on us oh no so no i appreciate that and and honestly i think for for you guys who are waiting you don't have to just like sit there for a month and just wait and do nothing like look you're still gonna have access to the slack community you'll still have access to the people who are in profit with javascript you'll have access to you know all of that so i would say take advantage of that um and you know even if you want to sneak into some of the coaching calls that are happening they're like probably do it like take advantage of it you know your official classes start on the december 8th but i'm just i'm just putting it out there yeah yeah okay awesome any other questions if not we will be done for today because we want you guys to get your program started we want you guys to get your calls booked and uh outside of that we need to get to start making the program for you
