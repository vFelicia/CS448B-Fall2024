00:00 - truths about software development and
00:02 - why
00:03 - you can't code right now or why you're
00:05 - having a hard time
00:07 - with coding this is my advice for you
00:11 - from me as a developer from the past 10
00:14 - years guys
00:15 - guys welcome welcome to today's live
00:17 - stream hope you guys
00:18 - are hope you guys are having fun hope
00:21 - you guys are enjoying it
00:22 - we're going to be talking about the four
00:23 - hard truths about software development
00:26 - and why you may be having a hard time
00:28 - right now
00:29 - just in general with coding right so
00:31 - this is something i want to cover
00:33 - the past few a few months now now
00:36 - let's actually fully get into it okay
00:38 - i'm not going to waste much time
00:39 - i'm just going to go straight into it
00:41 - the number one reason now before i fully
00:43 - get into it actually
00:45 - i'm gonna tell you this the fourth
00:47 - reason is the most important reason so
00:49 - make sure you stick around till the end
00:51 - of this video
00:52 - because the fourth reason is the most
00:53 - important reason why you have a hard
00:54 - time coding right now
00:56 - and also i might throw in
00:59 - a bonus so we'll see right awesome all
01:02 - right
01:02 - let's get to it my friends awesome so
01:05 - what is number one reason the number one
01:07 - reason is very simple okay
01:08 - it's you're in it for the one reason
01:11 - initially
01:12 - you're in it for the reason what does
01:13 - that mean well a lot of students i talk
01:16 - to a lot of students i talk to
01:18 - they might be in it because well they
01:20 - want to simply just make money
01:23 - i hear a lot of students say you know
01:24 - what well nas i just want to be rich i
01:26 - want to be on the beach
01:27 - and i want to be coding all day and
01:30 - that's it
01:32 - listen it doesn't work out that way this
01:34 - is a normal career
01:35 - just like any other career this is a
01:38 - hard career to be in
01:40 - it's a very difficult career to be part
01:41 - of right that requires a lot of problem
01:43 - solving a lot of patience
01:44 - it requires a lot of hard work from you
01:47 - and it creates time for you to get into
01:50 - right starting out and this is not easy
01:52 - so a lot of people think that you know
01:53 - what
01:54 - i'll be a freelancer and i'll make
01:55 - millions of dollars i'm sorry
01:57 - it does not work out that way just
02:00 - doesn't
02:01 - so this is why i think number one thing
02:03 - you need to understand is
02:04 - what is the reason that you're into this
02:07 - if you're in this because you know what
02:09 - if you're because okay i actually kind
02:11 - of like this i actually enjoy this
02:14 - and this is the reason why i want to try
02:16 - it in doing this
02:18 - that's a good reason then this will keep
02:20 - pushing you towards the struggles of
02:21 - actually coding
02:23 - but if you're in it just because you
02:24 - know what well i just want to be rich
02:29 - that's not a good enough reason
02:30 - unfortunately right so
02:33 - this is why you're not pushing through
02:35 - it's the reason why whenever you have
02:36 - challenges in front of you
02:38 - you're not able to get through them
02:41 - right so that's number one i want you
02:43 - guys to comment down below right now
02:45 - what is your number one reason for
02:49 - why you know why why you are
02:52 - you know what is what is your number one
02:53 - reason for coding or for getting at this
02:55 - comment down below i'm very curious okay
02:58 - hey what's up guys guys
02:59 - that's not kaiser nas for clever
03:01 - programmer here
03:04 - awesome sweet sweet sweet cool by the
03:05 - way awesome let's go continue on so
03:07 - that's your number one reason for
03:09 - why okay next up
03:13 - is you're not surrounded by other coders
03:17 - okay what is that that means
03:21 - when you are coding you want to make
03:22 - sure you surround yourself by other
03:24 - people who can push you
03:25 - right you are currently alone fully
03:28 - you're currently coding in your own
03:29 - house you're trying to do this fully by
03:30 - yourself right
03:33 - and the thing is you do not have anyone
03:36 - else
03:36 - who can inspire you to do it
03:40 - this is why i highly recommend for you
03:41 - guys for anybody here for example who
03:44 - were you are trying to get into coding
03:45 - or into development surround yourself
03:47 - find people who are also doing coding
03:50 - now the question you might be asking us
03:52 - where do i find those people
03:55 - good question there's a lot of there's a
03:57 - lot of ways you can find them the one
03:58 - but one for example is
04:00 - well there's for example let me show you
04:02 - right here this is meetups.com
04:04 - so meetups.com right you can find them
04:07 - there
04:08 - right maybe you can find maybe there's a
04:10 - college around you maybe there's
04:11 - college groups college groups
04:15 - who knows right any group you can find
04:19 - right so even for example i know
04:23 - if you just tap into google for example
04:25 - coding
04:26 - you know meetups
04:29 - road ups meetups this is what you'll get
04:34 - like it or not i'm not going to lie all
04:37 - of my jobs
04:38 - literally came from me knowing people
04:40 - you want to network in this business and
04:42 - you want to connect in this business
04:44 - this is the reason why a lot of you will
04:47 - actually be able to either survive
04:48 - and go into it or you won't and you'll
04:50 - give up and you'll go back to your old
04:52 - job
04:54 - so find other people who are doing this
04:57 - right
04:58 - they will inspire you they will push you
04:59 - and who knows they might connect you
05:01 - with somebody that
05:02 - might get you the job that's literally
05:04 - how i got all of my jobs my first job
05:06 - was through connection i went
05:08 - i went through a group i went through a
05:09 - meet-up in my college
05:12 - fine i found a few people found them
05:14 - reached out to them
05:15 - boom got them my second
05:19 - my second job was literally also through
05:21 - connection i asked a friend of mine
05:22 - hey can you potentially send in my
05:24 - resume he's like yeah sure
05:26 - no problem sent him a resume i went to
05:29 - an interview
05:29 - got the interview right it's things like
05:33 - that that will make you an
05:34 - actual great developer and that should
05:37 - succeed in this in this development
05:38 - world
05:38 - okay so find the people around you to
05:42 - push you
05:43 - and to inspire you and to connect you
05:45 - right there's a ton of them out there
05:47 - i'm sure you can it is a matter it's
05:50 - just a matter of you actually putting
05:51 - the time
05:51 - into it so that my friends is the second
05:54 - reason why
05:55 - you are having a hard time coding right
05:57 - now all right
05:58 - number three number three and what is
06:02 - that
06:02 - it is number three
06:06 - is going to be you're not
06:09 - challenging yourself enough now before i
06:11 - get into number three
06:12 - i wanna tell you guys for those of you
06:14 - who are looking to actually
06:16 - find a coding group around you we are
06:18 - currently doing a five-day coding booth
06:20 - game a free five-day cleaning boot camp
06:22 - starting wednesday uh starting wednesday
06:26 - this wednesday it is basically five days
06:28 - though you'll be challenged
06:30 - five days of kickstart your javascript
06:31 - career you'll build three amazing
06:33 - projects
06:34 - a sas product a game in javascript and
06:36 - you also build a landing page with 10k
06:39 - so
06:39 - if you want to go ahead and join it's
06:41 - completely free event
06:43 - fully five days live go ahead and click
06:46 - the link below there's a link below to
06:48 - join this free five-day boot camp
06:50 - and i'll see you there all right trust
06:52 - me it is going to be an amazing time
06:54 - probably something doesn't exist anymore
06:55 - yet so yeah anyways
06:58 - number three is going to be you're not
06:59 - challenging yourself enough
07:01 - right what does that mean well a lot of
07:03 - you guys are quitting way too fast you
07:05 - don't have
07:06 - enough the patience to actually go
07:07 - through with it right
07:09 - what do i mean by that well let's think
07:12 - about it
07:13 - you have a problem in front of you right
07:15 - you're coding okay great i'm coding you
07:16 - got this thing
07:17 - maybe i'm watching youtube tutorial and
07:19 - everything's all good
07:20 - right that's your process for example
07:22 - here let me show you the process here's
07:23 - your process
07:24 - here's your process you're coding right
07:26 - here okay you're coding this is your
07:28 - process let me see
07:30 - that's your process right i'm coding
07:35 - right that's your process next thing you
07:37 - have a problem
07:41 - that's your problem right now when you
07:43 - have a problem that's going to be the
07:44 - question of what do you
07:46 - do you do next there's either two
07:47 - pathways one
07:49 - is you go to the research mode
07:55 - or second pathway is you go into panic
07:57 - mode
08:00 - panic mode and sometimes you go into
08:02 - both
08:03 - which happens right that's the second
08:05 - reason
08:06 - now personally me i know my process and
08:09 - i go into research mode
08:10 - right at that point right i research i
08:14 - can be something booster for
08:15 - literally for two days three days
08:18 - to one week right
08:21 - because something it's a problem for
08:23 - example that you might not know how to
08:24 - solve
08:25 - maybe for example you're going through
08:26 - with it maybe you want to build a
08:27 - feature you just don't know how to do it
08:30 - and so you just give up you end up
08:31 - asking a bunch of people hoping they
08:33 - will give you the answers
08:34 - but here's the thing you need to
08:35 - understand the learning
08:39 - comes from you actually learning by
08:41 - yourself
08:43 - right the learning actually comes from
08:45 - you debugging from you doing a bunch of
08:47 - research because if crazy enough
08:49 - as you do all this research on the
08:51 - internet
08:52 - you're taking things that otherwise you
08:54 - wouldn't so rarely enough
08:56 - you actually do not want a straight up
08:59 - answer
09:01 - instead you want to put yourself in the
09:02 - uncomfortable situation
09:05 - to be able to do what to research
09:08 - right to find out things and this is how
09:11 - you're going to learn
09:12 - and most importantly you're going to get
09:13 - confidence in yourself knowing that you
09:15 - know what
09:16 - if i did research one thing i can
09:18 - research another thing and then boom
09:19 - this will allow me to biscuit solve any
09:21 - problem that i want
09:23 - so that's going to be a way to challenge
09:25 - yourself so if you're challenging
09:26 - yourself
09:27 - right or any problem be patient give
09:30 - yourself a few days a few hours
09:32 - a week if you have to then maybe you can
09:34 - ask for help from other people
09:36 - all right that's good number three so my
09:39 - friends
09:39 - now number four what do you think number
09:43 - four is
09:44 - right i'm at first personally very very
09:46 - um
09:47 - this is something i'm very passionate
09:48 - about this number four right here
09:50 - okay so number four
09:54 - is is the following it is
09:57 - you do not
10:02 - know
10:04 - the fundamentals you don't know the
10:07 - fundamentals around coding
10:10 - you're trying to skip ahead you're
10:13 - trying to skip ahead all the way
10:15 - to the top it's like it's like this it
10:16 - kind of looks like this right so let me
10:18 - let's just say
10:19 - uh we're doing we're building a house
10:21 - right so if we build a house right
10:23 - here's your house right
10:24 - it's got the deck it's got the floor
10:26 - it's got the roof right
10:28 - it's got the doors and the windows all
10:31 - of this right it's got the few windows
10:33 - boom boom boom looks like it's a funny
10:35 - funny looking house right
10:37 - don't mind it so what's happening right
10:40 - now with
10:41 - a lot of you guys is you're building the
10:44 - roof
10:45 - without building this
10:49 - you're basically you're going to react
10:51 - js
10:52 - you're building a bunch of applications
10:54 - from tutorials
10:55 - right you're building a bunch of great
10:57 - you're learning react js projects oh my
10:59 - god
11:00 - look at what i just built i built this
11:01 - react.js clone and stuff that's so
11:03 - awesome
11:03 - i'm like great man but if i ask you one
11:06 - simple question to do something for me
11:08 - you probably can't solve it by yourself
11:12 - you probably can't if i told you to
11:15 - merge two
11:16 - race together would you be able to do
11:17 - that fully by yourself without looking
11:18 - on the internet
11:20 - i would i will bet you 90 of people will
11:23 - not be able to
11:24 - so this is the reason why this right
11:26 - here is the issue
11:28 - the fundamentals when you build the
11:29 - house the first thing you build this
11:31 - is what the foundation it's kind of like
11:33 - when you build anything you put the
11:34 - people the car you build
11:36 - the the foundation of the car right
11:37 - which will hold it together
11:39 - right after that you build everything
11:42 - else
11:43 - right that's the whole goal here right
11:46 - so this is why a lot of you guys are
11:48 - building this
11:50 - a roof this is if you go straight to
11:53 - react gs
11:56 - if you skip javascript and you scrape
11:59 - and you strict to this
12:00 - this is what you do you're building
12:01 - you're building a roof on top of nothing
12:04 - instead you want to do is you actually
12:06 - want to build the fundamentals so what
12:07 - does that mean
12:08 - data structures
12:13 - sure we want to be able to do problems
12:16 - right you won't be able to understand
12:18 - how to write functions
12:20 - right variables right but fully what i
12:23 - mean by that is actually doing it fully
12:24 - by yourself i don't mean just
12:26 - you you know just you uh seeing things
12:29 - and
12:29 - you thinking hey you know oh yeah i know
12:31 - variables are great but if i told you to
12:33 - create a variable for me right now
12:35 - can you do it maybe not i don't know
12:38 - if i told you to create a function that
12:40 - will loop through an array can you do it
12:42 - i don't know but a lot of students can't
12:44 - unfortunately
12:45 - even though you're building crazy
12:47 - projects here
12:50 - this is right here the number one reason
12:54 - why you are not progressing in your
12:56 - coding career
12:58 - okay is the reason why you're not
13:01 - coding at the level you want to be
13:02 - coding and why you get stuck so often
13:04 - potentially so what you want to do is
13:06 - you want to focus on the mentals
13:08 - and on that note by the way if for those
13:10 - of you who do
13:11 - need that kind of help for those who do
13:13 - want to learn the fundamentals
13:15 - and maybe you want to need some help
13:16 - around guidance and so forth
13:19 - we do have a full stack mastery boot
13:20 - camp for those of you who are interested
13:22 - right we have a full site mastery
13:23 - bootcamp that goes through that right
13:25 - that fully takes you
13:26 - through the fundamentals it teaches you
13:28 - the data structures the algorithms that
13:30 - makes you really good
13:31 - and actually understand what coding is
13:35 - so if you're interested we have an
13:37 - application below to apply for
13:39 - full stack mastery boot camp apply down
13:42 - below we have a ton of students like
13:44 - aunt martin huda and so forth a lot of
13:47 - students who are going through the
13:48 - process
13:48 - and are getting jobs
13:52 - are getting jobs as developers because
13:54 - they've learned
13:55 - those fundamentals that we're talking
13:58 - about
13:59 - right here these fundamentals they learn
14:02 - this
14:02 - and so for them now actually building
14:05 - projects is fairly easy
14:06 - i mean that's not still not easy but
14:08 - it's pretty much much more doable
14:11 - so this is if you're interested again we
14:13 - have a link down below
14:14 - for you guys to go ahead and join other
14:16 - than that i have one other thing for you
14:19 - so guys what do you think about this
14:22 - so far i have a lot of people in the
14:24 - comments let me see i have a lot of
14:25 - people in the comments
14:26 - that are asking let me see
14:30 - let's see what are you guys saying i am
14:31 - from hello
14:33 - where are you guys from hello hello and
14:35 - graduating in business from it and have
14:37 - no clue
14:38 - somebody said i'm graduating look at
14:40 - this i'm graduating in business
14:42 - information i have no clue about coding
14:44 - i'm anxious for applying for a job now
14:46 - see this is the crazy part is a lot of
14:47 - you guys are going into these coding
14:49 - spaces and you don't even know much how
14:50 - to code which is very unfortunate right
14:54 - let me know if you're in that you're in
14:55 - the position i'm very curious actually
14:57 - hey that's how you i'm doing good i'm
14:59 - doing good awesome guys so i have
15:01 - one more i have one more bonus
15:04 - point for you one more bonus point one
15:07 - more bonus point okay
15:10 - so what is that what do you think it is
15:13 - so what you need to understand is here's
15:16 - a bonus point
15:18 - boom it is you don't
15:22 - have a problem solving process
15:27 - boom so a problem-solving process in
15:30 - coding is a very very important process
15:31 - for example my process is very simple
15:33 - right if i am presented with a problem
15:36 - okay boom my mind goes to one simple
15:38 - thing
15:38 - my mind goes ok nas let's go ahead and
15:41 - get you into the coding mode
15:42 - so what i'm going to do is i see the
15:43 - problem i figure out where the problem
15:46 - is right
15:46 - i use a bunch of console logs or print
15:49 - statements to actually get into it so
15:50 - for example if i
15:51 - look it up for you or if i actually
15:53 - print it out for you it kind of looks
15:54 - like this
15:55 - right let me kind of screw this first
15:57 - for example
15:58 - let's say there's a problem right
16:02 - there's a problem okay great okay
16:05 - my next question is where
16:09 - that's the next thing i figure out is
16:10 - where is it okay so i do a bunch of
16:12 - print statements
16:13 - a lot of times so print
16:17 - i do a bunch of print statements right i
16:18 - figure okay i print statements and
16:20 - figure out exactly where is my code
16:22 - breaking
16:23 - okay i start to i do a little more
16:25 - testing i
16:26 - test to figure out if actually that's
16:30 - the problem the problem is actually
16:31 - in that piece of code okay once i figure
16:34 - the portion out
16:34 - i usually start doing research
16:41 - right i start doing research in terms of
16:43 - through through google right through
16:45 - stack overflow
16:49 - through google stack overflow
16:52 - and so forth right so i go through all
16:54 - this research process to do that
16:57 - okay and i repeat and i repeat
17:01 - and i repeat this process non-stop until
17:04 - i figure it out
17:06 - literally until i figure it out
17:09 - and i have this process and the last
17:10 - process for example let's just say
17:12 - nothing
17:12 - works my last process as i go ahead and
17:14 - i ask people
17:17 - i ask other people or what i do
17:21 - is my last last last resort which i
17:24 - i really try to avoid is
17:27 - is i actually asked a question stack
17:30 - overflow
17:37 - ask the question step overflow so if
17:39 - this is something where you're
17:40 - struggling right
17:41 - figure out what your process is and be
17:43 - religious to that process knowing hey
17:44 - you know what
17:45 - if i'm stuck in a problem i got my
17:47 - process down i have it written down
17:49 - let's go through the process and give
17:51 - myself time more support to actually go
17:53 - through it
17:53 - and to resolve it so
17:56 - write it down what your process is
17:58 - actually comment below what your process
18:00 - is around around researching and around
18:02 - researching you know a bug or just
18:04 - coding problem solving general
18:07 - write this down let me know down in the
18:08 - comments below and then
18:10 - just use it that's the most important
18:11 - thing but guys other than that
18:14 - that's pretty much it this is your four
18:17 - hard truths
18:18 - about software development and why you
18:20 - are having a hard time encoding guys
18:22 - and this point if you guys have any
18:24 - questions i'll take a few questions here
18:25 - in a little bit
18:26 - for a little a few minutes until i have
18:28 - time let me see if you have any
18:30 - questions let me see let me see let me
18:31 - see
18:40 - let me see if there's any questions
18:41 - right now so far
18:44 - hello everybody hello hello good to see
18:46 - you guys by the way good to see you all
18:49 - let me see one of my questions so um
18:53 - okay as a biologist the scientific
18:55 - methodology
18:56 - helped me a lot with the logic and
18:58 - fundamentals of programming that's
18:59 - awesome
19:00 - yeah so if you that's what i tell a lot
19:02 - of people is if you have problem
19:04 - pro like if you have good problem
19:05 - solving skills and
19:07 - you have know the logic around you know
19:11 - somebody said somebody said i suddenly
19:12 - cry that's funny
19:15 - i inspect tools then stack it i cry too
19:19 - well guys crying is not gonna solve a
19:21 - lot of problems okay so
19:23 - make sure that you're actually working
19:24 - towards your problem
19:27 - best way to learn data structure is good
19:28 - question so best way to learn data
19:31 - structures is going to be
19:32 - well it's honestly going to be through
19:34 - practice it's going to be a lot of
19:35 - practice there's a really good book
19:37 - called um it's literally called um
19:41 - crack in the coding interview it's an
19:42 - amazing book that will help you
19:44 - a lot a lot uh let me see where was it
19:47 - where was the question or the question
19:50 - there we go
19:51 - yeah so like i said i think there's a
19:52 - book called crack in the corner
19:53 - interview practice or dance
19:55 - and then of course practice a lot
19:56 - through hacker rank i know lead code and
19:58 - so forth
19:59 - awesome uh i'm about i'm about an
20:03 - intermediate developer self-taught but i
20:05 - often still get stumped
20:06 - building projects wherever uh whenever
20:09 - i go and stack overflow i feel like i'm
20:11 - using a crutch is that normal
20:13 - no it's completely normal so i think
20:14 - that you know using a crutch kind of
20:16 - like stuck overflow is completely normal
20:17 - i still to this day use it
20:19 - i don't know the answer to every single
20:20 - question of course but you
20:22 - basically what you understand is as a
20:25 - coder you are a googler you
20:27 - you stick over all the time the most
20:29 - importantly is
20:30 - like stackoffer won't exactly give the
20:32 - answer but you
20:34 - at least will give it kind of like a
20:35 - hint so what you're still doing is
20:38 - still problem solving it's kind of like
20:40 - you know what if you have a problem
20:42 - or if you want to research something
20:43 - back in the day you go into a book
20:46 - right same situation here you go into a
20:48 - book except the book is the whole
20:50 - internet and so it makes things a lot
20:51 - easier for us
20:52 - that's pretty much it some says i sleep
20:55 - on it that's a really good one actually
20:58 - then then bum so actually i sleep on it
21:01 - that's good
21:01 - a lot of my answers quickly enough
21:03 - actually come from when i take a shower
21:05 - when i sleep
21:05 - you know and then i exactly kind of know
21:07 - what i'm doing that's a really good one
21:10 - let me see stuck overflow all day every
21:13 - day
21:14 - yeah hello nas hi stick of the old day
21:17 - every day you know it
21:21 - why we have a learn something
21:24 - i also cry joanna says
21:27 - that's a good one too haven't cried
21:29 - before trust me
21:34 - somebody said uh in my start development
21:36 - training they say break it down piece by
21:37 - piece one step
21:38 - yes very very good yes i try to break it
21:40 - down as much as possible right so you
21:41 - break down little problems into chunks
21:43 - and pieces
21:44 - and that's how you solve them that's
21:45 - pretty much it
21:47 - okay awesome let me see on that guys
21:51 - that's pretty much it that's all i have
21:52 - for you today
21:53 - uh around the four hartrus around
21:55 - software development
21:56 - like i said guys those five things you
21:58 - want to keep in mind the whole time
22:01 - right know your correct why challenge
22:03 - yourself a lot
22:04 - surround yourself around a lot surround
22:07 - yourself around other coders
22:08 - you know of course learn the
22:10 - fundamentals and make sure you have a
22:12 - right problem solving process
22:13 - and that that is pretty much it my
22:15 - friends hope you guys have a great day
22:18 - and i'll see you guys in the next one
22:20 - have a good day
22:22 - peace out
22:26 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

truths about software development and why you can't code right now or why you're having a hard time with coding this is my advice for you from me as a developer from the past 10 years guys guys welcome welcome to today's live stream hope you guys are hope you guys are having fun hope you guys are enjoying it we're going to be talking about the four hard truths about software development and why you may be having a hard time right now just in general with coding right so this is something i want to cover the past few a few months now now let's actually fully get into it okay i'm not going to waste much time i'm just going to go straight into it the number one reason now before i fully get into it actually i'm gonna tell you this the fourth reason is the most important reason so make sure you stick around till the end of this video because the fourth reason is the most important reason why you have a hard time coding right now and also i might throw in a bonus so we'll see right awesome all right let's get to it my friends awesome so what is number one reason the number one reason is very simple okay it's you're in it for the one reason initially you're in it for the reason what does that mean well a lot of students i talk to a lot of students i talk to they might be in it because well they want to simply just make money i hear a lot of students say you know what well nas i just want to be rich i want to be on the beach and i want to be coding all day and that's it listen it doesn't work out that way this is a normal career just like any other career this is a hard career to be in it's a very difficult career to be part of right that requires a lot of problem solving a lot of patience it requires a lot of hard work from you and it creates time for you to get into right starting out and this is not easy so a lot of people think that you know what i'll be a freelancer and i'll make millions of dollars i'm sorry it does not work out that way just doesn't so this is why i think number one thing you need to understand is what is the reason that you're into this if you're in this because you know what if you're because okay i actually kind of like this i actually enjoy this and this is the reason why i want to try it in doing this that's a good reason then this will keep pushing you towards the struggles of actually coding but if you're in it just because you know what well i just want to be rich that's not a good enough reason unfortunately right so this is why you're not pushing through it's the reason why whenever you have challenges in front of you you're not able to get through them right so that's number one i want you guys to comment down below right now what is your number one reason for why you know why why you are you know what is what is your number one reason for coding or for getting at this comment down below i'm very curious okay hey what's up guys guys that's not kaiser nas for clever programmer here awesome sweet sweet sweet cool by the way awesome let's go continue on so that's your number one reason for why okay next up is you're not surrounded by other coders okay what is that that means when you are coding you want to make sure you surround yourself by other people who can push you right you are currently alone fully you're currently coding in your own house you're trying to do this fully by yourself right and the thing is you do not have anyone else who can inspire you to do it this is why i highly recommend for you guys for anybody here for example who were you are trying to get into coding or into development surround yourself find people who are also doing coding now the question you might be asking us where do i find those people good question there's a lot of there's a lot of ways you can find them the one but one for example is well there's for example let me show you right here this is meetups.com so meetups.com right you can find them there right maybe you can find maybe there's a college around you maybe there's college groups college groups who knows right any group you can find right so even for example i know if you just tap into google for example coding you know meetups road ups meetups this is what you'll get like it or not i'm not going to lie all of my jobs literally came from me knowing people you want to network in this business and you want to connect in this business this is the reason why a lot of you will actually be able to either survive and go into it or you won't and you'll give up and you'll go back to your old job so find other people who are doing this right they will inspire you they will push you and who knows they might connect you with somebody that might get you the job that's literally how i got all of my jobs my first job was through connection i went i went through a group i went through a meetup in my college fine i found a few people found them reached out to them boom got them my second my second job was literally also through connection i asked a friend of mine hey can you potentially send in my resume he's like yeah sure no problem sent him a resume i went to an interview got the interview right it's things like that that will make you an actual great developer and that should succeed in this in this development world okay so find the people around you to push you and to inspire you and to connect you right there's a ton of them out there i'm sure you can it is a matter it's just a matter of you actually putting the time into it so that my friends is the second reason why you are having a hard time coding right now all right number three number three and what is that it is number three is going to be you're not challenging yourself enough now before i get into number three i wanna tell you guys for those of you who are looking to actually find a coding group around you we are currently doing a fiveday coding booth game a free fiveday cleaning boot camp starting wednesday uh starting wednesday this wednesday it is basically five days though you'll be challenged five days of kickstart your javascript career you'll build three amazing projects a sas product a game in javascript and you also build a landing page with 10k so if you want to go ahead and join it's completely free event fully five days live go ahead and click the link below there's a link below to join this free fiveday boot camp and i'll see you there all right trust me it is going to be an amazing time probably something doesn't exist anymore yet so yeah anyways number three is going to be you're not challenging yourself enough right what does that mean well a lot of you guys are quitting way too fast you don't have enough the patience to actually go through with it right what do i mean by that well let's think about it you have a problem in front of you right you're coding okay great i'm coding you got this thing maybe i'm watching youtube tutorial and everything's all good right that's your process for example here let me show you the process here's your process here's your process you're coding right here okay you're coding this is your process let me see that's your process right i'm coding right that's your process next thing you have a problem that's your problem right now when you have a problem that's going to be the question of what do you do you do next there's either two pathways one is you go to the research mode or second pathway is you go into panic mode panic mode and sometimes you go into both which happens right that's the second reason now personally me i know my process and i go into research mode right at that point right i research i can be something booster for literally for two days three days to one week right because something it's a problem for example that you might not know how to solve maybe for example you're going through with it maybe you want to build a feature you just don't know how to do it and so you just give up you end up asking a bunch of people hoping they will give you the answers but here's the thing you need to understand the learning comes from you actually learning by yourself right the learning actually comes from you debugging from you doing a bunch of research because if crazy enough as you do all this research on the internet you're taking things that otherwise you wouldn't so rarely enough you actually do not want a straight up answer instead you want to put yourself in the uncomfortable situation to be able to do what to research right to find out things and this is how you're going to learn and most importantly you're going to get confidence in yourself knowing that you know what if i did research one thing i can research another thing and then boom this will allow me to biscuit solve any problem that i want so that's going to be a way to challenge yourself so if you're challenging yourself right or any problem be patient give yourself a few days a few hours a week if you have to then maybe you can ask for help from other people all right that's good number three so my friends now number four what do you think number four is right i'm at first personally very very um this is something i'm very passionate about this number four right here okay so number four is is the following it is you do not know the fundamentals you don't know the fundamentals around coding you're trying to skip ahead you're trying to skip ahead all the way to the top it's like it's like this it kind of looks like this right so let me let's just say uh we're doing we're building a house right so if we build a house right here's your house right it's got the deck it's got the floor it's got the roof right it's got the doors and the windows all of this right it's got the few windows boom boom boom looks like it's a funny funny looking house right don't mind it so what's happening right now with a lot of you guys is you're building the roof without building this you're basically you're going to react js you're building a bunch of applications from tutorials right you're building a bunch of great you're learning react js projects oh my god look at what i just built i built this react.js clone and stuff that's so awesome i'm like great man but if i ask you one simple question to do something for me you probably can't solve it by yourself you probably can't if i told you to merge two race together would you be able to do that fully by yourself without looking on the internet i would i will bet you 90 of people will not be able to so this is the reason why this right here is the issue the fundamentals when you build the house the first thing you build this is what the foundation it's kind of like when you build anything you put the people the car you build the the foundation of the car right which will hold it together right after that you build everything else right that's the whole goal here right so this is why a lot of you guys are building this a roof this is if you go straight to react gs if you skip javascript and you scrape and you strict to this this is what you do you're building you're building a roof on top of nothing instead you want to do is you actually want to build the fundamentals so what does that mean data structures sure we want to be able to do problems right you won't be able to understand how to write functions right variables right but fully what i mean by that is actually doing it fully by yourself i don't mean just you you know just you uh seeing things and you thinking hey you know oh yeah i know variables are great but if i told you to create a variable for me right now can you do it maybe not i don't know if i told you to create a function that will loop through an array can you do it i don't know but a lot of students can't unfortunately even though you're building crazy projects here this is right here the number one reason why you are not progressing in your coding career okay is the reason why you're not coding at the level you want to be coding and why you get stuck so often potentially so what you want to do is you want to focus on the mentals and on that note by the way if for those of you who do need that kind of help for those who do want to learn the fundamentals and maybe you want to need some help around guidance and so forth we do have a full stack mastery boot camp for those of you who are interested right we have a full site mastery bootcamp that goes through that right that fully takes you through the fundamentals it teaches you the data structures the algorithms that makes you really good and actually understand what coding is so if you're interested we have an application below to apply for full stack mastery boot camp apply down below we have a ton of students like aunt martin huda and so forth a lot of students who are going through the process and are getting jobs are getting jobs as developers because they've learned those fundamentals that we're talking about right here these fundamentals they learn this and so for them now actually building projects is fairly easy i mean that's not still not easy but it's pretty much much more doable so this is if you're interested again we have a link down below for you guys to go ahead and join other than that i have one other thing for you so guys what do you think about this so far i have a lot of people in the comments let me see i have a lot of people in the comments that are asking let me see let's see what are you guys saying i am from hello where are you guys from hello hello and graduating in business from it and have no clue somebody said i'm graduating look at this i'm graduating in business information i have no clue about coding i'm anxious for applying for a job now see this is the crazy part is a lot of you guys are going into these coding spaces and you don't even know much how to code which is very unfortunate right let me know if you're in that you're in the position i'm very curious actually hey that's how you i'm doing good i'm doing good awesome guys so i have one more i have one more bonus point for you one more bonus point one more bonus point okay so what is that what do you think it is so what you need to understand is here's a bonus point boom it is you don't have a problem solving process boom so a problemsolving process in coding is a very very important process for example my process is very simple right if i am presented with a problem okay boom my mind goes to one simple thing my mind goes ok nas let's go ahead and get you into the coding mode so what i'm going to do is i see the problem i figure out where the problem is right i use a bunch of console logs or print statements to actually get into it so for example if i look it up for you or if i actually print it out for you it kind of looks like this right let me kind of screw this first for example let's say there's a problem right there's a problem okay great okay my next question is where that's the next thing i figure out is where is it okay so i do a bunch of print statements a lot of times so print i do a bunch of print statements right i figure okay i print statements and figure out exactly where is my code breaking okay i start to i do a little more testing i test to figure out if actually that's the problem the problem is actually in that piece of code okay once i figure the portion out i usually start doing research right i start doing research in terms of through through google right through stack overflow through google stack overflow and so forth right so i go through all this research process to do that okay and i repeat and i repeat and i repeat this process nonstop until i figure it out literally until i figure it out and i have this process and the last process for example let's just say nothing works my last process as i go ahead and i ask people i ask other people or what i do is my last last last resort which i i really try to avoid is is i actually asked a question stack overflow ask the question step overflow so if this is something where you're struggling right figure out what your process is and be religious to that process knowing hey you know what if i'm stuck in a problem i got my process down i have it written down let's go through the process and give myself time more support to actually go through it and to resolve it so write it down what your process is actually comment below what your process is around around researching and around researching you know a bug or just coding problem solving general write this down let me know down in the comments below and then just use it that's the most important thing but guys other than that that's pretty much it this is your four hard truths about software development and why you are having a hard time encoding guys and this point if you guys have any questions i'll take a few questions here in a little bit for a little a few minutes until i have time let me see if you have any questions let me see let me see let me see let me see if there's any questions right now so far hello everybody hello hello good to see you guys by the way good to see you all let me see one of my questions so um okay as a biologist the scientific methodology helped me a lot with the logic and fundamentals of programming that's awesome yeah so if you that's what i tell a lot of people is if you have problem pro like if you have good problem solving skills and you have know the logic around you know somebody said somebody said i suddenly cry that's funny i inspect tools then stack it i cry too well guys crying is not gonna solve a lot of problems okay so make sure that you're actually working towards your problem best way to learn data structure is good question so best way to learn data structures is going to be well it's honestly going to be through practice it's going to be a lot of practice there's a really good book called um it's literally called um crack in the coding interview it's an amazing book that will help you a lot a lot uh let me see where was it where was the question or the question there we go yeah so like i said i think there's a book called crack in the corner interview practice or dance and then of course practice a lot through hacker rank i know lead code and so forth awesome uh i'm about i'm about an intermediate developer selftaught but i often still get stumped building projects wherever uh whenever i go and stack overflow i feel like i'm using a crutch is that normal no it's completely normal so i think that you know using a crutch kind of like stuck overflow is completely normal i still to this day use it i don't know the answer to every single question of course but you basically what you understand is as a coder you are a googler you you stick over all the time the most importantly is like stackoffer won't exactly give the answer but you at least will give it kind of like a hint so what you're still doing is still problem solving it's kind of like you know what if you have a problem or if you want to research something back in the day you go into a book right same situation here you go into a book except the book is the whole internet and so it makes things a lot easier for us that's pretty much it some says i sleep on it that's a really good one actually then then bum so actually i sleep on it that's good a lot of my answers quickly enough actually come from when i take a shower when i sleep you know and then i exactly kind of know what i'm doing that's a really good one let me see stuck overflow all day every day yeah hello nas hi stick of the old day every day you know it why we have a learn something i also cry joanna says that's a good one too haven't cried before trust me somebody said uh in my start development training they say break it down piece by piece one step yes very very good yes i try to break it down as much as possible right so you break down little problems into chunks and pieces and that's how you solve them that's pretty much it okay awesome let me see on that guys that's pretty much it that's all i have for you today uh around the four hartrus around software development like i said guys those five things you want to keep in mind the whole time right know your correct why challenge yourself a lot surround yourself around a lot surround yourself around other coders you know of course learn the fundamentals and make sure you have a right problem solving process and that that is pretty much it my friends hope you guys have a great day and i'll see you guys in the next one have a good day peace out
