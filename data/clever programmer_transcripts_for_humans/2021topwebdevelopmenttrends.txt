00:00 - guys frankie here from clubber
00:01 - programmer and today i have the honor to
00:03 - sit with my friend
00:05 - what's up aaron here from clever
00:06 - programmer what's up frankie what's up
00:08 - man you guys know aaron from the
00:10 - python tutorials of 2019 we killed it
00:13 - back in the day
00:14 - um and 2020 and 2020 as well don't
00:16 - neglect 2020 also the whole live streams
00:18 - and everything
00:19 - but anyways guys today we're going to
00:20 - hit on the top web development trends of
00:24 - 2021. hell yeah and the upcoming year
00:27 - that's 2018 to an end
00:30 - a lot of people actually released this
00:32 - title right and we wanted to give our
00:34 - own that was back here what's up nas
00:36 - how's it going wanna come say hi
00:38 - and a lot of people gave their two cents
00:39 - on it now it's our turn so we're gonna
00:42 - discuss what's in
00:43 - right now okay so let's get into it guys
00:48 - all right to begin with guys you know
00:51 - pay attention a lot of value is gonna be
00:52 - given
00:53 - throughout this live stream and
00:55 - everything that we say
00:56 - is very practical so actually take it
00:58 - into action
01:00 - turn off your phones exactly exactly so
01:03 - it's
01:03 - time to focus so top
01:07 - trends in web development i actually saw
01:09 - this specific graphic in one of the
01:11 - one article online and i thought it was
01:13 - good how they explained it
01:15 - so i kind of wanted to grab it for
01:16 - myself
01:18 - i'll give correctly the developers look
01:20 - like superheroes
01:21 - yeah jacked him in the world with
01:24 - development traits so you want to
01:27 - explain this aaron
01:28 - yeah so i mean we the way we kind of
01:31 - looked at this was
01:32 - um there are a lot of trends right when
01:35 - it comes to can you hear me
01:36 - it keeps cutting up but there's a lot of
01:38 - trends that you can follow but i mean
01:40 - even those
01:41 - they're just trends but there's a few
01:43 - things that you do not want to forget
01:44 - about when i'm thinking about
01:46 - web apps or i mean program in general
01:48 - but in this case
01:49 - web development is good it's good
01:53 - all right yeah so and pretty much when
01:55 - you're making an app
01:56 - uh this kind of is just like underlying
02:00 - um principles you need to follow like
02:01 - your apps need to be responsive like
02:03 - they need to be fast that's the first
02:04 - thing so
02:05 - um make sure that you always have like
02:07 - fast apps they also be pretty so i mean
02:09 - this
02:10 - makes sense for web development and and
02:12 - mobile development web apps and all that
02:14 - kind of stuff
02:14 - because you want to look pretty because
02:16 - it looks like not then people aren't
02:18 - really going to care
02:19 - last thing is it needs to be intelligent
02:20 - so this is kind of like the trifecta of
02:23 - things you need to keep in mind
02:24 - regardless of the trend like make sure
02:26 - your apps are
02:27 - fast and responsive and they look good
02:30 - using uh different frameworks and that
02:31 - they're intelligent
02:32 - um using some kind of back-end
02:34 - algorithms and stuff and we'll go into
02:35 - these a little bit more
02:36 - as we go into the into the stream but uh
02:38 - just keep these three in mind so
02:40 - responsive pretty and intelligent make
02:42 - sure your apps have all three
02:43 - um as we're going along awesome and
02:46 - exactly guys we're gonna expound on all
02:48 - of these
02:48 - and let's actually keep it moving
02:50 - forward so
02:52 - one of the cool things about this
02:55 - specific you know trend list that we
02:56 - wanted to do
02:58 - is like aaron said you know they're
03:00 - called trends because most of the time
03:01 - you think of trends as things that are
03:03 - passenger or you know come and go but we
03:06 - wanted to base this list
03:08 - off of things that obviously are
03:09 - relevant that are trends but at the same
03:11 - time
03:12 - kind of have a principle right so you
03:14 - know the principles of this type of
03:16 - website you know
03:17 - building or development can actually you
03:20 - know
03:20 - it can actually carry you guys for a few
03:23 - years because
03:24 - we're literally talking about a bunch of
03:25 - principles and one of the biggest
03:27 - principles right now is
03:28 - really mobile first design and you want
03:31 - to explain a little bit about that okay
03:32 - yeah so actually i want to say that
03:34 - out of every trend this is kind of the
03:37 - probably the most important one because
03:39 - it kind of determines everything else
03:40 - everything is under the
03:41 - the umbrella of of this one trend right
03:44 - here so already
03:45 - look at this focus on this it's not even
03:47 - a trend like unique to 2021 um it's just
03:49 - it's
03:50 - upcoming year but each year it's going
03:51 - to be even a bigger bigger trend and
03:52 - that's
03:53 - a mobile first design so i found this
03:56 - again another superhero graphic yep man
03:59 - that's the whole theme of it
04:00 - you know developers are super heroes and
04:02 - no no go back bro
04:03 - okay okay i just wanted to mention this
04:05 - so like yeah it's super important
04:07 - because
04:07 - most users are always using their phone
04:10 - over their desktop so
04:11 - um in order to be able to like create
04:15 - apps that are being used by more people
04:17 - more frequently and more accessible like
04:19 - more convenient for them then
04:20 - mobile is taking over slowly slowly so i
04:22 - mean the first iphone came out what 2007
04:24 - from
04:24 - i mean the first smartphone the iphone
04:26 - in 2007 and since then every single year
04:28 - there's more apps there's more things
04:30 - there's more functionality there's more
04:31 - models there's more companies building
04:32 - smartphones
04:33 - and it's crazy and it's going to keep
04:35 - going up and up so the biggest trend
04:36 - right now is mobile so you want to make
04:38 - sure that your stuff is always
04:39 - mobile friendly and actually prioritize
04:42 - that first
04:42 - because as you can see on the on the
04:44 - display here on the on the slides
04:46 - yep also prioritize it think about it
04:49 - guys like normally if you see a website
04:51 - that doesn't have a mobile friendly
04:53 - design or if it doesn't even have a
04:55 - mobile you know
04:56 - version of that page you kind of like i
05:00 - personally think about them like
05:01 - oh damn like they never got to develop
05:02 - this the company might not be that
05:04 - professional or something like that you
05:05 - know i always feel like there's
05:06 - something missing
05:07 - i mean things like instagram right like
05:08 - instagram was mobile only first and then
05:11 - eventually years later they eventually
05:12 - got the desktop version up and running
05:14 - that's true on the web app and so it's
05:15 - like
05:15 - and i'm glad and how big is instagram
05:17 - but i think there's more instagram using
05:19 - the facebook users right
05:20 - i don't know that's crazy really but i
05:22 - mean at least in the younger generation
05:23 - facebook has been debated by the adults
05:25 - right yeah but by the grand mom is there
05:28 - not trying to catch on and be hit
05:29 - anyways you know mobile development and
05:32 - sorry mobile first design is actually
05:34 - very important and we saw a cool article
05:35 - here from cnbc and they're talking about
05:38 - how nearly three-quarters of the world
05:41 - right now
05:42 - will use just their smartphones to
05:44 - access the internet by 2025. so in
05:47 - five years and 5g is coming to you look
05:49 - look at the ad advertisement there
05:50 - that's crazy
05:52 - yeah yeah because yeah and with 5g
05:54 - coming in mobile stuff is going to be
05:56 - even
05:56 - more like prevalent like it's going to
05:59 - be dominating in the next
06:01 - five 10 years you're really going to
06:02 - make sure that mob your mobile stuff is
06:04 - on point or else you're going to slowly
06:05 - be overshadowed
06:06 - and even from there from like a meta
06:07 - trend level after mobile phones come by
06:10 - like i mean wearable tech is coming
06:11 - right virtual
06:12 - virtual reality augmented reality that's
06:14 - eventually going to take over the
06:15 - smartphones and mobile development in
06:16 - the next 20 30 years when that stuff is
06:18 - like
06:19 - the main drivers when you have your
06:20 - google glasses yeah apple apple's making
06:22 - apple glasses soon it's coming out in
06:24 - the next probably
06:24 - a few years and stuff like that so like
06:26 - once that kicks in then the trends are
06:28 - gonna eventually go over there but for
06:29 - 2021 just focus on mobile smartphone
06:31 - stuff
06:32 - yep so augmented reality is really big
06:34 - actually you know huge companies like
06:35 - ikea are using it right now
06:37 - so you know mobile and all of the
06:39 - technology is moving forward to
06:41 - different directions i mean i'm not sure
06:42 - how it's going to look in five years
06:43 - from now but
06:44 - i mean three quarters is 75 out of
06:46 - everything
06:47 - so another cool point that we really did
06:50 - want to hit
06:50 - is the fact that real-time web
06:52 - applications
06:53 - are super important in these days you
06:56 - can see you know big companies like
06:58 - facebook big companies like
06:59 - instagram you know have very responsive
07:03 - times whenever you are
07:04 - you know browsing their website because
07:07 - people have low attention spans
07:08 - exactly yeah and it's actually one of
07:10 - the biggest drivers of
07:11 - people bouncing from the websites yeah
07:14 - it takes
07:17 - like if it's like a boring 15 seconds
07:19 - you skip that
07:20 - if it's if it's like if it's interesting
07:23 - you'll like watch the first three or
07:24 - four seconds then you'll skip it that's
07:25 - true it's like this we're just the
07:27 - attention span you know it needs to be
07:28 - like fast and responsive where people
07:30 - get upset
07:30 - you know spinning beach balls people go
07:32 - crazy over like milliseconds and stuff
07:34 - so
07:34 - yeah i know one of the tools we actually
07:36 - didn't mention it here but one of the
07:37 - tools that a lot of developers use in
07:39 - big
07:39 - commercial projects is google lighthouse
07:42 - which
07:43 - you know teaches you or shows you how to
07:44 - optimize the websites
07:46 - you know in micro optimizations but you
07:48 - know ultimately it's
07:50 - for that note and one of the things that
07:52 - or companies that actually use
07:54 - this um the real-time web applications
07:57 - is
07:57 - all of these you know so fresh uh fresh
08:00 - books never heard that
08:01 - fresh i mean yeah a lot of these like a
08:02 - lot of the big companies have
08:04 - uh really real-time application and this
08:07 - just goes back to the trifecta i talked
08:08 - about before
08:09 - so your stuff needs to be pretty so i
08:10 - mean for mobile a lot of stuff is pretty
08:12 - but then these real-time things like
08:13 - things need to be responsive where
08:14 - people are just going to not use your
08:16 - app like
08:16 - if an app is slow like usually people
08:19 - just don't use it like if you go to like
08:20 - the app store
08:21 - on your iphone and like oh this is not
08:23 - working it's slow it's laggy it's buggy
08:24 - people just don't use it it has little
08:26 - reviews but like stuff like instagram
08:27 - like
08:28 - and presentation is pretty much
08:29 - everything but the fact is that
08:31 - the prettiness of things comes from the
08:33 - fact of you know if it's
08:35 - too clunky or too you know there's so
08:38 - much going on
08:38 - it's almost not intuitive how to move
08:41 - around the app
08:42 - you know so prettiness comes in handy
08:45 - with actual
08:46 - you know efficiency and results for that
08:47 - app so that's why we wanna you know
08:50 - actually focus on that evernote
08:52 - instagram dropbox uber twitter post
08:54 - mates
08:55 - meetup paypal and salesforce are some of
08:58 - the
08:58 - companies that use that you want to
09:00 - expound on this
09:01 - oh dang yeah yeah so another another
09:03 - trend that's been up and coming
09:05 - uh recently so a little history lesson
09:07 - too
09:08 - so if you guys didn't know um guys also
09:10 - sorry aaron um
09:12 - don't spam the chat because i'm gonna
09:14 - block you you know we're all here to
09:16 - learn
09:16 - and it's it's very annoying when
09:18 - somebody's just you know spamming
09:20 - same comment over and over so you know
09:23 - trying to deliver value here what is
09:24 - ponder let's take it serious
09:26 - let's let's do something that can change
09:27 - our lives guys so come on let's say we
09:28 - were adults here
09:30 - enjoy but what were you saying about it
09:31 - single page yeah so single page website
09:34 - so for you guys
09:34 - who don't know this is another um thing
09:37 - that has been implemented a lot recently
09:38 - it's a big trend over the
09:40 - last few years and going into the future
09:42 - this is going to be catching on more and
09:43 - more
09:44 - and it's another responsive thing so
09:45 - make your websites a lot more responsive
09:48 - so what this is is uh back in the day
09:50 - like when it never first started up
09:52 - right everything was everything's built
09:54 - on html and css i think most people know
09:56 - that if you're watching this video
09:57 - so uh the way it works is you like fetch
09:59 - a page and then you click the link and
10:00 - then it'll go fetch more html from the
10:04 - from the server right over and over
10:06 - again um but that takes a lot of time
10:07 - because it's like a lot of back and
10:08 - forth so there's a thing called single
10:10 - page websites that's been catching on
10:12 - recently and
10:13 - yeah on um websites like facebook google
10:15 - twitter like like the you know like the
10:17 - big mega powerhouse
10:18 - kind of websites and services and uh the
10:21 - idea is instead of like keep
10:22 - like talking to the server okay you guys
10:24 - hear the dog barking in the background i
10:26 - think some dogs
10:27 - it's upstairs and you can hear all the
10:28 - way here these microphones were that
10:30 - good but yeah so single page application
10:34 - websites are also known as spas spas
10:36 - yeah if you've ever heard that acronym
10:38 - before but basically all it is is just
10:39 - saying instead of like keep
10:41 - uh contacting the server over and over
10:42 - again just kind of like load
10:44 - all of it um pretty much at one time
10:47 - into one single mega page and then just
10:49 - kind of like as you click on stuff just
10:51 - kind of like get different segments of
10:52 - that so you really only contact the
10:53 - server like one time
10:55 - and then it makes it so much faster
10:56 - because you're not like back and forth
10:57 - back and forth you just get it all at
10:58 - one time
10:59 - and then you can kind of dynamically
11:00 - load it so uh
11:02 - google uses this i mean you can't really
11:04 - see it like
11:05 - on the surface level but under the hood
11:07 - it's implemented that way and that's how
11:08 - it can be so fast
11:10 - uh things like google facebook like as
11:12 - you click links and stuff like it loads
11:13 - a lot faster because then it doesn't
11:14 - have to like keep accessing
11:16 - the server database exactly so i didn't
11:18 - actually listed it here because i was
11:19 - going to list examples of multi-page
11:21 - applications
11:22 - i actually think i might have skipped it
11:25 - but
11:26 - you know in general multi-page
11:27 - applications are more like
11:29 - e-commerce websites such as amazon ebay
11:32 - all of these that actually have a bunch
11:34 - of
11:34 - sites or websites put together and you
11:36 - go like if you click a button or a link
11:39 - it might take you to
11:40 - an interwebs or a sub website sub domain
11:42 - of that website
11:44 - and here on the on the single page
11:46 - applications everything is handled
11:48 - on the same actual loaded website on
11:51 - your computer like aaron was saying
11:52 - but you know it is part of the
11:55 - development
11:56 - world right now it's kind of what is in
11:58 - i'd say you know
12:00 - get inspiration from the best companies
12:01 - that are out right now so another big
12:03 - point that we wanted to hit as well is
12:06 - chatbots and ai
12:08 - and as you can see here it's funny
12:10 - because like somebody put the
12:12 - adobe illustrator logo here for ai which
12:15 - is
12:15 - maybe they didn't know or something i
12:18 - mean they probably use google search
12:19 - like oh ai and then they found adobe
12:21 - illustrator
12:22 - but i mean it gets the message across
12:23 - yeah so right here they're explaining
12:25 - like uh they're saying when it comes to
12:27 - responses while an interface just
12:28 - presents options within
12:30 - with an ai chatbot you can type in your
12:32 - own answer
12:33 - so the cool thing about this man is like
12:35 - for example if you're having a service
12:36 - website or you know you deliver
12:38 - some kind of product anything like that
12:40 - we use it we use
12:41 - actual you know chat bots in our company
12:44 - you know cleverprogrammer.com if you
12:45 - check it out
12:46 - we got a chatbot there that you know
12:48 - they
12:49 - they serve different you know functions
12:52 - so for example you can collect data from
12:53 - the people that are going into your
12:54 - website
12:55 - i think one of the questions that we had
12:57 - is are you a beginner in programming are
12:59 - you intermediate or advanced you know
13:00 - so it's cool because you can get to know
13:03 - the people that visit your website a
13:04 - little bit more maybe
13:05 - you know make your product more towards
13:08 - them
13:08 - and another way to do it is in it's huge
13:12 - here
13:12 - it's customer support so ai and chat
13:15 - bots are used
13:16 - immensely in customer support you can
13:18 - see it in a bunch of websites
13:19 - so i know a lot of big websites even
13:21 - like youtube i believe
13:22 - doesn't have customer support so it'd be
13:24 - awesome if they can just have like a
13:26 - very intelligent chatbot yeah yeah so
13:29 - again remember the trifecta needs to be
13:30 - pretty
13:31 - responsive needs to be intelligent so um
13:34 - it needs to have all three you want to
13:35 - be like
13:35 - visually appealing to not lose people's
13:38 - patience but also needs to
13:39 - like make freaking sense yeah like get a
13:42 - tangible
13:42 - thing done for the user so things like
13:44 - chatbots and ai and then even things
13:46 - like recommended you know like on
13:47 - netflix and amazon they have recommended
13:49 - items
13:50 - yes so aaron was actually studying ai in
13:52 - georgia tech right
13:53 - yeah i was and then then i stopped
13:56 - to work here yeah so that was this guy
13:59 - deep into that world
14:00 - you know he was mentioning the
14:02 - recommended algorithms on netflix
14:05 - yeah yeah so stuff like this i mean like
14:07 - people probably already know about this
14:08 - i mean like every
14:09 - like software nowadays has an algorithm
14:11 - youtube algorithm you know it feeds you
14:13 - videos you've seen before netflix tells
14:14 - you your recommended shows right
14:16 - instagram shows you oh this these
14:18 - pictures you might like
14:19 - um and uh stuff like even like targeted
14:22 - ads you know like as people are clicking
14:24 - on stuff they start getting targeted by
14:25 - these ads
14:26 - so this is what i mean by intelligent
14:27 - apps you definitely want to have some
14:29 - kind of um algorithmic
14:31 - aspect to your apps to make it like
14:33 - really good yeah it's like i feel a
14:34 - little bit betrayed
14:36 - yeah i feel i feel a little bit betrayed
14:37 - when i don't see like for example if
14:38 - you're using
14:39 - any video website any any website in
14:41 - general and that like you use it a lot
14:44 - and they cannot recommend you know
14:46 - things that you already look for in that
14:47 - website as in like
14:48 - you know like how annoying would youtube
14:50 - be if like you're watching you're
14:51 - watching a bunch of like content that
14:52 - you really like right like
14:54 - uh whatever like let's say i'm watching
14:55 - sewing videos i don't actually watch
14:56 - sewing videos
14:59 - but like let's say i'm super into sewing
15:01 - let's just say
15:02 - i'm super into something yeah and
15:05 - hypothetically speaking hypothetically
15:06 - i'm just
15:07 - hypothetical but um i want to be seeing
15:09 - more sewing videos but if you just
15:10 - kept showing me like car videos or like
15:12 - dog videos over and over just random
15:14 - videos and it never caught on to my
15:15 - trend i'd be like what the heck youtube
15:17 - like okay cool you just told me random
15:18 - stuff
15:19 - show me more sewing show me how to knit
15:21 - show me how to use a sewing machine
15:22 - show me how to uh do hand sewing like
15:25 - and the cool thing about that
15:26 - is for example whatever it's um
15:29 - it's good because it makes you feel like
15:31 - you're one your experience of that
15:33 - website is personalized
15:35 - two it's not only does it
15:38 - like help me as a user the thing is that
15:41 - you as a website
15:42 - developer you know you want people to
15:44 - actually use the websites
15:45 - so you know people are going to lean
15:47 - towards your website if
15:49 - there it has an algorithm that
15:50 - recognizes its searches or
15:52 - things that you know other for example
15:54 - like spotify
15:56 - this is how i get to know a bunch of
15:57 - different new songs you know they
15:59 - recommend me songs that are
16:00 - similar to the songs that i listen to
16:02 - and then my they give me so much value
16:05 - by knowing by getting to know different
16:07 - types of music
16:08 - so not only is it very efficient for
16:10 - users to keep using your website or app
16:13 - but also it's um was it going to say
16:16 - it's it's damn i completely blanked out
16:19 - from my
16:20 - i lost my train of thought something
16:22 - else yeah
16:23 - i mean i was i was just saying how
16:25 - important it is um you know people are
16:26 - going to use it more and
16:28 - and actually it's it's almost this is
16:30 - what i was going to say
16:31 - so people don't like stupid apps it's
16:33 - like smart standard nowadays dude like
16:35 - it's it's now part of everything it
16:36 - should be part of everything pretty much
16:38 - so just moving forward a little bit
16:39 - about you know chat bots here's an
16:41 - example of how it would work
16:42 - as i was mentioning maybe customer
16:43 - support would be a good example of
16:45 - this so examples yeah just like
16:48 - communicating
16:49 - communicating with uh with the user in
16:50 - some intelligent way using a chatbot but
16:52 - then also just being intelligent
16:54 - in in a way like using like algorithms
16:56 - to do recommending stuff like pick up
16:58 - pick up their preferences and stuff like
16:59 - that correct yeah and we were watching a
17:01 - video by
17:02 - demind i believe and like i said you
17:05 - know we were talking about trends but
17:06 - ultimately it is going to be principles
17:09 - and the cool thing about this is that we
17:11 - do want to start out with foundations
17:14 - because man if you're looking for trends
17:16 - all the time
17:17 - and like i said this is based more of
17:19 - principles rather than trends but if
17:21 - you're looking for trends all the time
17:22 - you have to know the foundations for you
17:24 - to exploit those trends
17:25 - and some of the foundations with web
17:27 - development would be
17:29 - oh yeah so like okay really real real
17:31 - quick i see a lot of people in the
17:32 - comments are saying mern and mean
17:34 - um if you guys want those are then yeah
17:36 - these are huge trends as you can see
17:37 - we've been dropping a lot of mern stack
17:39 - stuff
17:39 - um recently and we're going to be
17:41 - continuing to do this into 2020
17:43 - um 2021 and going forward um
17:47 - so mern and mean is just like using
17:48 - react and angular and some other stuff
17:50 - that
17:50 - we'll talk about in a bit but those are
17:52 - like the huge huge trends as well
17:53 - they're gonna tie in but to prelude that
17:55 - uh yeah you didn't you do need to know
17:56 - your basics so
17:57 - anybody who doesn't uh if you're
17:59 - watching this video and you're like oh
18:00 - trends
18:00 - uh it doesn't matter if you know the
18:02 - trends if you don't know the basics so
18:03 - you gotta learn html css and javascript
18:05 - first
18:06 - because that's kind of what everything's
18:07 - built on so we're just mentioning that i
18:08 - mean
18:09 - probably obvious but it's good to just
18:10 - mention i feel your voice going in and
18:13 - out a little bit yeah i don't know
18:14 - what's up with this because when you
18:15 - when you're silent it kind of
18:17 - kills the sound and then when you start
18:19 - start talking it like it it
18:21 - turns out for me but anyways those are
18:23 - the
18:24 - the actual foundations of web
18:25 - development and css to begin with
18:28 - is pretty much it's the pretty part of
18:31 - web development right
18:32 - so you know learn how to use different
18:34 - layouts of websites
18:35 - flexbox it's a great library for css
18:39 - as well as you know css is used a lot
18:41 - now for responsive design
18:43 - and like aaron was saying we're dropping
18:45 - a bunch of value bombs during our you
18:47 - know mern stacks or just you know the
18:49 - what is it the firebase with react you
18:52 - know tutorials and builds that we're
18:53 - dropping as well
18:54 - all of those things you know go deep
18:57 - into css
18:58 - and we use it in very responsive manners
19:01 - so if you guys are enjoying this content
19:02 - and you want to see something a little
19:03 - bit more technical
19:04 - then go into those videos and actually
19:07 - get those builds done and put them on
19:08 - your portfolio
19:09 - yeah pretty much all the apps we're
19:11 - building are trendy apps
19:13 - by definition so i mean we're talking
19:15 - about it here on a high level but if you
19:16 - actually just wanted to see examples and
19:17 - we built all those clones like
19:19 - these things going forward like by
19:20 - definition they're trendy because these
19:22 - websites are trendy
19:23 - yeah so like if you do what they do and
19:24 - you understand what they've built then
19:26 - that's great so yeah mern
19:28 - marin is very big um uh and we use a lot
19:30 - of firebase
19:31 - is firebase isn't part of marine one
19:32 - thing yeah mern is what mongodb
19:34 - express js um reacts and uh node.js
19:38 - and then mean is the anc the same thing
19:41 - but with angular instead of react so
19:42 - those two are
19:43 - are definitely big and keep an eye on
19:46 - those and we'll talk about those in a
19:47 - second
19:47 - beautiful and you know js is a huge part
19:51 - of the basics as well and js normally is
19:53 - the
19:54 - portion of you know the thing that takes
19:56 - action so a video playing
19:58 - so an image popping up anything that
20:01 - requires
20:02 - you know some movement is js
20:05 - everything else like html would be what
20:09 - wait on the website html would be what
20:11 - oh yeah it's just a structure i mean
20:13 - yeah if you guys
20:14 - i think most people know but html just
20:16 - like defines all the different parts of
20:17 - the website and then you have it all
20:18 - there then css makes it all like pretty
20:20 - the way presented and js is just like
20:22 - how do you like interact with the page
20:24 - and a simple way to think about it too
20:25 - is html is more text oriented
20:28 - css is more color oriented and js is
20:31 - more action oriented so
20:34 - these are a bunch of things that you can
20:36 - jump into regarding javascript
20:38 - and so those those would be the basics
20:41 - but you know
20:42 - maybe you're asking what about visual
20:43 - and design stuff you know maybe for
20:46 - all the front end developers out there
20:48 - you know
20:49 - what are the cool things that are
20:50 - trending right now and
20:52 - um a lot of people ask this question
20:54 - what the visual design stuff
20:56 - yeah so i mean what is a framework
20:58 - specifically a framework well yeah i
21:00 - mean
21:00 - we're talking about framers because like
21:02 - for the visual design stuff yeah it's
21:03 - like
21:04 - well frameworks are libraries whatever
21:06 - you want to call it i mean most people
21:07 - understand they get all worked up it's
21:08 - like
21:09 - react is a library not a framework like
21:11 - okay yeah you get the idea oh no it's
21:13 - both
21:14 - whatever you want to call it it's a
21:15 - thing that you can add on on top of
21:16 - javascript and html to
21:18 - um to make cool websites so yeah
21:20 - framework is just like an extension so i
21:22 - mean the
21:23 - main three we're gonna be talking about
21:24 - are react view and angular right yeah so
21:26 - so for example it's like if you're
21:28 - building websites and you're going to
21:29 - want to use
21:30 - you're you're building multiple websites
21:32 - you're going to want to use a slideshow
21:33 - on your website let's just say that
21:35 - instead of coding like instead of coding
21:37 - it from scratch what you want to do is
21:39 - you know people
21:40 - that build websites pretty much have
21:42 - code that they had already used in a
21:44 - specific sense as in like
21:45 - maybe a function or utility like a
21:47 - slideshow like i was mentioning
21:49 - people already build these type of
21:51 - things and those things are a framework
21:52 - so if you're wanting to build a web
21:54 - you know a responsive website there's
21:56 - frameworks for that so
21:58 - if you want to build maybe you know an
22:01 - android app there's frameworks for that
22:02 - and frameworks are pretty much specific
22:04 - code
22:05 - snippets or or actual you know functions
22:07 - that you can use so
22:08 - going deeper into frameworks these are
22:10 - some of the bigger ones right now
22:12 - and web development so angular
22:15 - is huge you know it's one of the biggest
22:17 - ones right now google as you can see
22:19 - google mr google there it was developed
22:21 - by google
22:22 - it has a version one and version two
22:24 - right now well obviously it's a version
22:26 - two
22:26 - and it got a little bit less complicated
22:29 - in version two
22:30 - i don't even i don't want to go so deep
22:32 - into it as we do mention in other videos
22:34 - and you know vue is is a very good one
22:37 - as well
22:38 - all of these are front-end frameworks
22:40 - yeah view is kind of the lagger though
22:41 - right now i
22:41 - feel like angular is is bigger than view
22:44 - it's used by more
22:45 - more people but i mean it's good to know
22:46 - um if you know all three i mean then
22:48 - you're pretty flying hive when it comes
22:49 - to like using frameworks and front-end
22:51 - design and stuff and then
22:52 - these of course and work into like the
22:54 - tech stacks where you're talking about
22:55 - like merge stacks and mean stacks
22:57 - so you're definitely gonna want to know
22:59 - um one two
23:00 - or three of these so view is also very
23:03 - new i think it's the newest one of them
23:04 - all right now and i think vue was made
23:06 - by
23:07 - a google employee if i'm not mistaken i
23:09 - actually don't even know though
23:10 - it's incorrect behind it yeah yeah it's
23:12 - super new yeah
23:13 - but a lot of people are leaning towards
23:15 - it i know it's catching up
23:17 - i know i watched a video by stefan
23:18 - mischook i believe it's
23:21 - yeah his name yeah this guy's cool he's
23:22 - like calm and intense just yeah i love
23:24 - him he has a bunch of experience
23:26 - he was saying that he himself prefers
23:28 - view
23:29 - um but it still needs to catch up so
23:32 - another
23:33 - cool one obviously that you guys know
23:35 - yeah from us a lot of clever programmer
23:37 - and papa react
23:38 - you guys know sunday react sunny what is
23:39 - up sonny how are we doing bro
23:41 - he's he's it's really he's really just
23:42 - zuckerberg you know but he with a with a
23:44 - mask on
23:45 - yeah that's him react yeah so we got a
23:47 - bunch of builds with react if you guys
23:49 - want to check them out on the channel
23:50 - react is huge right now there's a lot of
23:52 - market share for web development in
23:54 - react
23:54 - and huge companies like this kind of
23:56 - king right now angular is pretty good
23:58 - too but i mean react is like really
24:00 - catching on
24:02 - and it's so powerful like we created all
24:03 - the clones with react and firebase like
24:05 - we weren't even using for
24:06 - like a full merm stack or anything it
24:08 - was just pure react and firebase for a
24:09 - lot of it right
24:10 - so fast man yeah and it's just good like
24:12 - you can just
24:13 - kill it like firebase is a big trend too
24:16 - right yeah i mean we're going to talk
24:17 - about that exactly and we'll expand on
24:18 - that a little bit more so we'll react
24:20 - was created by facebook just like
24:22 - angular was created by google
24:24 - and here's an example of the one inside
24:26 - the cute little table or
24:27 - apps that use you know react
24:30 - so so angular.js the guardian which is
24:33 - one of the biggest you know news
24:34 - companies in the world right now
24:35 - uses angularjs upwork one of the biggest
24:38 - freelancing websites in the world
24:40 - paypal obviously you guys know paypal
24:42 - you know it's uh
24:43 - processing payments sony cool i think i
24:47 - believe sony is a chinese web um
24:48 - company japanese it's japanese pretty
24:51 - sure it's japanese whoa
24:53 - yeah yeah oh yeah japanese that's true
24:56 - sorry guys apologize for my ignorance
24:59 - airbnb
25:00 - uses react we built the airbnb clone
25:02 - instagram
25:03 - uses react uber eats oh beautiful i mean
25:06 - yeah like big things use these
25:08 - frameworks i mean like exactly pretty
25:09 - much every website uses javascript
25:11 - nowadays like oh
25:12 - every website like it's crazy it's just
25:14 - like a given at this point but i mean
25:15 - these frameworks
25:16 - like add a layer of um flexibility and
25:19 - uh like
25:21 - like power behind even that more so like
25:23 - these these websites are utilizing these
25:25 - frameworks to like make the websites
25:26 - really really uh responsive and
25:28 - pretty and intelligent yeah and although
25:31 - they are i mean not intelligent you know
25:32 - although they
25:33 - are um what's it called like front end
25:35 - you know framework
25:36 - grammarly uses this in grammarly like i
25:38 - don't see it have so much
25:40 - like ui or anything yeah i mean yeah i
25:42 - guess like view like what is it what is
25:43 - what is ipl dashboard i don't that is
25:45 - i don't know exactly um yeah you guys
25:48 - heard of those but i mean you can kind
25:49 - of see angular reactions that's kind of
25:51 - the bigger
25:51 - yeah oh my god all the express in
25:55 - alibaba right
25:56 - so now yeah let's talk about data
26:00 - oh yeah so going back to like the um
26:03 - response i think it's more like in the
26:04 - responsiveness part right yeah so like
26:06 - yeah they go into data
26:08 - so you want to explain a little bit
26:09 - about this yeah so um
26:11 - if you guys don't know there's something
26:14 - called sql so this is
26:15 - uh it stands for structured query
26:17 - language and all this means is a way to
26:18 - have your data in a database so of
26:21 - course everybody knows like storing data
26:22 - and databases is pretty much required
26:24 - when you are creating apps uh especially
26:26 - web apps because you want to store some
26:28 - kind of data like oh what's in the cart
26:30 - what's the catalog of all the products
26:31 - et cetera yada yada or your whole your
26:33 - social media profile
26:36 - um so there's this thing called sql
26:38 - structured query language which just
26:40 - kind of allows us to structure our data
26:41 - in a database which was kind of which is
26:43 - kind of the traditional way of housing
26:44 - a data in a database which is nice
26:46 - everything's nice and organized
26:48 - um but you're kind of like stuck to a
26:50 - structure
26:51 - and um recently what's been caching a
26:53 - little bit more uh nowadays is something
26:55 - called no sql which kind of just allows
26:56 - you to just dog pile a bunch of data
26:58 - usually in the form of json into um some
27:02 - database without worrying about like all
27:04 - the structures and having everything
27:05 - like
27:06 - oh this this record points to this
27:08 - record that points to this record that
27:09 - points to this record like it gets too
27:11 - complicated versus
27:12 - no sql where you can just be like here's
27:14 - a gigantic thing of json in here you
27:16 - just like
27:16 - dump everything in and then just get
27:18 - kind of like more fluid about it so like
27:20 - i guess you can kind of say sq is like
27:22 - the the structured organized approach
27:24 - and the note sql is just kind of like yo
27:25 - just put everything in here
27:26 - and just get smart about sifting through
27:28 - it quickly yeah it's also high level
27:29 - explanation it's also cool because like
27:31 - sql or sql um is a language pretty much
27:35 - and i guess for no sql databases you
27:37 - don't really need sql you really need to
27:39 - know sql
27:40 - i i bet you use sql to you know query
27:43 - through different searches that you want
27:44 - to do on these non-sql databases
27:46 - but all in all it's not tied up just to
27:48 - sql the sql language
27:52 - so that's an example of nosql yeah oh
27:55 - okay so here's a little graphic what is
27:57 - a nosql database
27:58 - um yeah pretty much so like i already
28:01 - touched on all these in
28:02 - the previous slide just now about nosql
28:04 - databases because you're not limited to
28:06 - like some kind of structured data
28:07 - that you can get faster performance easy
28:09 - replication because you can just kind of
28:10 - just like chunk everything together
28:12 - more bigger data capacity i mean big big
28:14 - data capability because you can just
28:16 - like put a bunch in there scalability uh
28:19 - that high scalability that ties into the
28:20 - big
28:21 - um capability uh and all that it's just
28:24 - it's just easier like we don't have to
28:25 - worry about um
28:27 - like oh having the structured language
28:32 - sounds good yeah okay i don't know if
28:34 - the audio is cutting i know my mic is
28:36 - kind of weird but i feel like they can
28:37 - hear me
28:38 - um yes a lot of people using nosql
28:40 - databases ask if they're
28:41 -  they're actually scalable and you
28:44 - know other
28:45 - and we're about to mention a few of them
28:46 - you know firebase is a very known one
28:48 - i was talking to a developer mongodb
28:50 - yeah which is part of the
28:52 - stack is the leading no sql database so
28:55 - that's one of the big trends that's
28:56 - where i'm mentioning this because going
28:57 - to 2021 like you need to know you're
28:59 - murdering your mean you definitely don't
29:00 - know
29:00 - do we even put that in here i don't
29:01 - think we put it in the slides though i
29:02 - mean just we didn't mention this
29:04 - yeah listen listen to us the mern and
29:05 - the mean which ties into
29:07 - because that allows you to create um uh
29:10 - like
29:10 - just pretty apps that are intelligent
29:12 - and they are responsive and all that
29:13 - using these tech stacks
29:14 - exactly and like i was saying right now
29:16 - i was talking to a developer and he was
29:18 - mentioning to me that sometimes
29:20 - firebase is not you know used by
29:23 - bigger you know tech companies right now
29:25 - just because
29:26 - a lot of companies don't want to be tied
29:27 - up to a google ecosystem of their
29:29 - database
29:30 - and their whole tech firebase is from
29:31 - google right yeah firebase is from
29:33 - google
29:34 - and you know other like bigger scalable
29:37 - projects right now
29:38 - are using sql so sql is very used but
29:41 - you know the whole trend the whole
29:43 - movement is is going
29:45 - yeah it's living out because uh these
29:48 - merge stacks are just so powerful
29:50 - having like cross-platform capability
29:51 - like you can you can actually prioritize
29:53 - the mobile design going forward and then
29:55 - they also have like
29:56 - uh web apps that work on all different
29:57 - screen sizes and stuff um
29:59 - and then like you just have like the
30:00 - powerhouse and the the ease of
30:02 - implementation using the react and
30:04 - angular
30:06 - frameworks slash libraries whatever you
30:07 - want to call it uh
30:09 - and um node.js like you can house all
30:11 - your data on the backend and mongodb
30:13 - like like basically these tech stacks
30:15 - are the trends like the biggest ones
30:16 - that are coming up
30:17 - um but you uh
30:20 - you definitely want to um
30:23 - start transitioning to an oc yeah yeah
30:25 - yeah pretty much i mean
30:27 - just just learn mongodb you just learn
30:28 - learning just learn it check out our
30:30 - yesterday we went live david went live
30:33 - showing
30:34 - i believe was part two of the facebook
30:36 - clone and that uses the mern stack and
30:38 - it's awesome man that it the front end
30:40 - looks amazing
30:41 - so check that out you know this is an
30:43 - example of how it's
30:44 - used i feel like we already talked about
30:46 - this yeah so
30:48 - no sequels used more for gaming social i
30:50 - don't really know what l
30:51 - iot is yeah internet of things oh yeah
30:54 - yeah internet of things web
30:55 - mobile enterprise and it uses a key
30:58 - value store document base and column
31:00 - family store
31:01 - on nosql databases and on sql databases
31:04 - it's more like for web or mobile
31:06 - or big enterprises as i was mentioning
31:08 - and
31:09 - it also uses relational table storage i
31:11 - mean there's some overlap here like web
31:12 - is on both enterprise on both mobiles on
31:14 - both i think what they're trying to say
31:15 - mainly is the bottom
31:19 - there's like relationships between the
31:20 - data everything's like kind of tied
31:21 - together in this way and it can get
31:22 - complicated
31:23 - versus just like um no sql use like
31:26 - chunk at all like like i said like
31:27 - it's a dog pile of data so you can get
31:29 - smart about sifting through and then
31:31 - it's just so much easier like um easier
31:33 - to scale so this is more linear and this
31:35 - is more
31:36 - you know i guess it goes pretty much
31:38 - yeah yeah anything goes
31:40 - and you know just chunk it in as long as
31:41 - it's json just chuck it in bro
31:43 - yeah we'll be fine we'll figure it out
31:45 - so aaron was mentioning this is one of
31:46 - the
31:47 - most famous you know no sequel databases
31:49 - right now yeah mongodb is a big one so
31:51 - that's why
31:51 -  is um the m in mern and mean
31:55 - so for mongodb so definitely learn this
31:58 - going forward in 2021 catch our murder
32:00 - clones that david and sonia have been
32:02 - doing
32:03 - in recent weeks for those and just like
32:05 - brush up on these
32:06 - and guys if you guys are enjoying the
32:07 - content right now we are at 134 likes on
32:10 - this video that is amazing let's try to
32:12 - get to 150 likes
32:14 - let's get it guys thank you thank you
32:15 - guys so much for being here so
32:17 - firebase is another big you know no sql
32:20 - database right now
32:21 - in the industry and yeah you love this
32:23 - this isn't part of murder mean
32:25 - um but we've been using it recently uh
32:27 - first of all because sunny's a badass
32:29 - using react and firebase together so
32:30 - this is kind of like its own little mini
32:31 - tech stack so you should learn merin and
32:33 - mean but also learn firebase because
32:35 - um it's just so powerful like the
32:37 - netflix sloan was powered by it
32:39 - um i don't know what other clones i
32:40 - haven't seen all sony's clones but i
32:41 - know a lot of them pretty much
32:42 - almost all of them are using firebase
32:44 - and it's it's a it's a really really hot
32:46 - trend it just makes it so easy to handle
32:47 - your data in your databases
32:49 - um so in addition to mern and mean
32:50 - definitely learn firebase we should we
32:52 - should uh
32:54 - um i have our own tech stack like r
32:57 - like rf react react firebase
33:00 - oh yeah yeah yeah rf that's cool we're
33:02 - an rf guys for tony
33:03 - the cool thing about the sunny way the
33:05 - cool thing about firebase is that it's
33:07 - very easy to implement i've seen sony
33:08 - implemented i myself don't have much
33:10 - experience with yeah
33:11 - or anything at all yeah but you know i
33:13 - know it's one of the trending nosql
33:14 - databases
33:15 - but i've seen the setup of it and it's
33:17 - so easy it's so user friendly so smooth
33:19 - it's like pretty much plug and play
33:21 - colleen colleen
33:23 - exactly so these are the bigger names
33:25 - and you know there's a little conclusion
33:27 - here for you guys
33:28 - yeah yeah pretty much i just want to
33:29 - recover again so basically the main
33:31 - takeaways are uh
33:32 - yeah definitely learn your mirn your
33:34 - mean and your your firebase along with
33:36 - that
33:36 - um but the idea the biggest trends when
33:39 - it comes to like a high level remember
33:40 - like do mobile first because most people
33:42 - um are on their phones nowadays and
33:45 - that's only going to increase going
33:46 - forward
33:47 - as the i mean there's new smartphones
33:49 - coming out every year you know like
33:50 - apple's releasing their
33:51 - new iphone in what month probably less
33:53 - than a month
33:54 - i think so i mean they always leak i
33:56 - don't know
33:57 - probably something like that but i mean
33:59 - the idea is you know like smartphones
34:00 - ain't going away and then
34:01 - um you know ar and vr is coming later
34:05 - too but just focus on moa for now
34:06 - uh the other important thing is just
34:08 - having it cross platform so this is
34:09 - where
34:10 - um the merin and mean come in come in
34:12 - handy because uh you're able to create
34:14 - um apps that are just like good across
34:17 - every platform so martin is for mongodb
34:20 - right so that
34:20 - allows you to house your data really
34:22 - well um e is the express js
34:24 - which is uh i believe it allows you to
34:26 - house data for the
34:27 - mobile stuff um a lot and then uh
34:30 - reactor angular
34:31 - is for the nice pretty front end and
34:33 - then node.js just allows you to hold
34:35 - your data
34:36 - as well so cross-platform specifically
34:38 - is you can use it
34:39 - in a lot of different mediums yeah i'm
34:41 - just
34:42 - we're just mentioning that because uh
34:44 - you want to make sure that your apps
34:46 - work everywhere
34:47 - or if it works on a different screen
34:48 - sizes cross-platform just means like oh
34:50 - does it work on the web does work on
34:51 - your phone does it work on your is your
34:52 - local app
34:53 - all that stuff uh but just make sure
34:56 - that
34:56 - you are prioritizing mobile first
34:58 - because that's the biggest trend that's
34:59 - happening here
35:00 - and then also make sure it's class
35:02 - platform but using mern and mean
35:03 - uh kind of covers that cross platform
35:05 - for you it's just it makes it nice and
35:07 - easy
35:08 - and then uh again remember the trifecta
35:10 - make sure your apps are responsive make
35:11 - sure they're pretty make sure they're
35:12 - intelligent
35:13 - uh in order to for it to be a good
35:15 - opportunity people aren't going to want
35:16 - to use your like just
35:17 - make sure it has all three exactly
35:19 - exactly so that's a good baseline for
35:21 - you guys to base yourself upon
35:23 - yeah you know responsive pretty
35:24 - intelligent are then using what i mean
35:26 - rpi or rip only love it love it
35:30 - yeah so let me see what you guys are
35:31 - saying on the comments do we see any
35:33 - cool comment
35:34 - um i would some do say i would use
35:37 - laravel php and node
35:39 - so all of those things you know guys you
35:42 - know
35:42 - do implement them right now they are
35:45 - trends like i said based on principles
35:48 - and if you guys see websites that have
35:50 - these points you're gonna see
35:52 - how better it is to use those type of
35:54 - websites for example single page
35:56 - applications or
35:57 - real-time website applications or you
36:00 - know
36:00 - yeah i mean okay so we mentioned the
36:01 - single page applications like when you
36:03 - use like angular and react basically
36:05 - this response of this stuff is built in
36:06 - it's baked in so we mentioned these
36:08 - trends but the best way to actually
36:09 - implement these trends is again just use
36:11 - mern mean
36:12 - and rf the the react fire yeah
36:15 - it'll it'll be responsive by definition
36:18 - um you have all of like the mobile
36:20 - uh functionality and everything you have
36:22 - like the cross platform capability all
36:24 - through those tech stacks that's the
36:25 - point of a tech stack is just being jack
36:27 - like across
36:28 - all these things that matter and um the
36:30 - only thing that we kind of didn't really
36:31 - talk too much about is the intelligent
36:33 - part like
36:33 - actually adding an algorithm stuff
36:34 - you're going to know something you know
36:35 - some python
36:36 - um probably to get to get all that
36:38 - implemented but
36:40 - uh that's also important too but i mean
36:41 - arguably that might be the hardest one
36:45 - yep yep so all right guys that was
36:48 - pretty much the whole list for you guys
36:50 - like i said do implement this if you
36:51 - guys are enjoying this content make sure
36:53 - to smash that like button subscribe to
36:54 - the channel
36:55 - also check out the other builds that
36:56 - aaron was talking about all the mern
36:58 - stack builds that we have been dropping
37:00 - these past weeks and everything
37:01 - even the older well i say older but it's
37:05 - like a month old
37:05 - you know all the apps that we were
37:07 - building as well sunny and qazi were
37:08 - building
37:09 - i think it was facebook you know google
37:11 - freaking instagram
37:13 - tinder all of these huge websites that
37:15 - are trending right now we show you
37:16 - exactly step by step how to build
37:18 - their interfaces and if you guys
37:21 - want to become a javascript developer
37:23 - make sure to hit the link in the
37:25 - description below
37:26 - so you guys can see how we built netflix
37:29 - and
37:29 - we've seen so many students you know
37:31 - build these type of builds
37:32 - put them on the portfolio and actually
37:34 - land jobs
37:36 - so you know if you take it serious if
37:38 - you do just
37:39 - you know want to step a little bit back
37:40 - from the theory and actually get into
37:42 - practice
37:43 - it's a great way to start especially if
37:45 - you want to learn web development
37:49 - yep awesome thank you guys
37:52 - for watching this was frankie this was
37:55 - aaron
37:56 - and um yep just remember uh pretty
38:00 - responsive intelligent our burn and mean
38:04 - in rf that's exactly conclusion just
38:07 - just do that and then watch our watch
38:08 - our clones and
38:09 - you'll be pretty pretty good to go for
38:10 - 2021. take it easy guys thank you much
38:13 - thank you so much for watching this was
38:14 - the top
38:16 - web development trends in 2021
38:20 - yup peace we'll see you in the next
38:22 - video peace guys
38:23 - take it easy

Cleaned transcript:

guys frankie here from clubber programmer and today i have the honor to sit with my friend what's up aaron here from clever programmer what's up frankie what's up man you guys know aaron from the python tutorials of 2019 we killed it back in the day um and 2020 and 2020 as well don't neglect 2020 also the whole live streams and everything but anyways guys today we're going to hit on the top web development trends of 2021. hell yeah and the upcoming year that's 2018 to an end a lot of people actually released this title right and we wanted to give our own that was back here what's up nas how's it going wanna come say hi and a lot of people gave their two cents on it now it's our turn so we're gonna discuss what's in right now okay so let's get into it guys all right to begin with guys you know pay attention a lot of value is gonna be given throughout this live stream and everything that we say is very practical so actually take it into action turn off your phones exactly exactly so it's time to focus so top trends in web development i actually saw this specific graphic in one of the one article online and i thought it was good how they explained it so i kind of wanted to grab it for myself i'll give correctly the developers look like superheroes yeah jacked him in the world with development traits so you want to explain this aaron yeah so i mean we the way we kind of looked at this was um there are a lot of trends right when it comes to can you hear me it keeps cutting up but there's a lot of trends that you can follow but i mean even those they're just trends but there's a few things that you do not want to forget about when i'm thinking about web apps or i mean program in general but in this case web development is good it's good all right yeah so and pretty much when you're making an app uh this kind of is just like underlying um principles you need to follow like your apps need to be responsive like they need to be fast that's the first thing so um make sure that you always have like fast apps they also be pretty so i mean this makes sense for web development and and mobile development web apps and all that kind of stuff because you want to look pretty because it looks like not then people aren't really going to care last thing is it needs to be intelligent so this is kind of like the trifecta of things you need to keep in mind regardless of the trend like make sure your apps are fast and responsive and they look good using uh different frameworks and that they're intelligent um using some kind of backend algorithms and stuff and we'll go into these a little bit more as we go into the into the stream but uh just keep these three in mind so responsive pretty and intelligent make sure your apps have all three um as we're going along awesome and exactly guys we're gonna expound on all of these and let's actually keep it moving forward so one of the cool things about this specific you know trend list that we wanted to do is like aaron said you know they're called trends because most of the time you think of trends as things that are passenger or you know come and go but we wanted to base this list off of things that obviously are relevant that are trends but at the same time kind of have a principle right so you know the principles of this type of website you know building or development can actually you know it can actually carry you guys for a few years because we're literally talking about a bunch of principles and one of the biggest principles right now is really mobile first design and you want to explain a little bit about that okay yeah so actually i want to say that out of every trend this is kind of the probably the most important one because it kind of determines everything else everything is under the the umbrella of of this one trend right here so already look at this focus on this it's not even a trend like unique to 2021 um it's just it's upcoming year but each year it's going to be even a bigger bigger trend and that's a mobile first design so i found this again another superhero graphic yep man that's the whole theme of it you know developers are super heroes and no no go back bro okay okay i just wanted to mention this so like yeah it's super important because most users are always using their phone over their desktop so um in order to be able to like create apps that are being used by more people more frequently and more accessible like more convenient for them then mobile is taking over slowly slowly so i mean the first iphone came out what 2007 from i mean the first smartphone the iphone in 2007 and since then every single year there's more apps there's more things there's more functionality there's more models there's more companies building smartphones and it's crazy and it's going to keep going up and up so the biggest trend right now is mobile so you want to make sure that your stuff is always mobile friendly and actually prioritize that first because as you can see on the on the display here on the on the slides yep also prioritize it think about it guys like normally if you see a website that doesn't have a mobile friendly design or if it doesn't even have a mobile you know version of that page you kind of like i personally think about them like oh damn like they never got to develop this the company might not be that professional or something like that you know i always feel like there's something missing i mean things like instagram right like instagram was mobile only first and then eventually years later they eventually got the desktop version up and running that's true on the web app and so it's like and i'm glad and how big is instagram but i think there's more instagram using the facebook users right i don't know that's crazy really but i mean at least in the younger generation facebook has been debated by the adults right yeah but by the grand mom is there not trying to catch on and be hit anyways you know mobile development and sorry mobile first design is actually very important and we saw a cool article here from cnbc and they're talking about how nearly threequarters of the world right now will use just their smartphones to access the internet by 2025. so in five years and 5g is coming to you look look at the ad advertisement there that's crazy yeah yeah because yeah and with 5g coming in mobile stuff is going to be even more like prevalent like it's going to be dominating in the next five 10 years you're really going to make sure that mob your mobile stuff is on point or else you're going to slowly be overshadowed and even from there from like a meta trend level after mobile phones come by like i mean wearable tech is coming right virtual virtual reality augmented reality that's eventually going to take over the smartphones and mobile development in the next 20 30 years when that stuff is like the main drivers when you have your google glasses yeah apple apple's making apple glasses soon it's coming out in the next probably a few years and stuff like that so like once that kicks in then the trends are gonna eventually go over there but for 2021 just focus on mobile smartphone stuff yep so augmented reality is really big actually you know huge companies like ikea are using it right now so you know mobile and all of the technology is moving forward to different directions i mean i'm not sure how it's going to look in five years from now but i mean three quarters is 75 out of everything so another cool point that we really did want to hit is the fact that realtime web applications are super important in these days you can see you know big companies like facebook big companies like instagram you know have very responsive times whenever you are you know browsing their website because people have low attention spans exactly yeah and it's actually one of the biggest drivers of people bouncing from the websites yeah it takes like if it's like a boring 15 seconds you skip that if it's if it's like if it's interesting you'll like watch the first three or four seconds then you'll skip it that's true it's like this we're just the attention span you know it needs to be like fast and responsive where people get upset you know spinning beach balls people go crazy over like milliseconds and stuff so yeah i know one of the tools we actually didn't mention it here but one of the tools that a lot of developers use in big commercial projects is google lighthouse which you know teaches you or shows you how to optimize the websites you know in micro optimizations but you know ultimately it's for that note and one of the things that or companies that actually use this um the realtime web applications is all of these you know so fresh uh fresh books never heard that fresh i mean yeah a lot of these like a lot of the big companies have uh really realtime application and this just goes back to the trifecta i talked about before so your stuff needs to be pretty so i mean for mobile a lot of stuff is pretty but then these realtime things like things need to be responsive where people are just going to not use your app like if an app is slow like usually people just don't use it like if you go to like the app store on your iphone and like oh this is not working it's slow it's laggy it's buggy people just don't use it it has little reviews but like stuff like instagram like and presentation is pretty much everything but the fact is that the prettiness of things comes from the fact of you know if it's too clunky or too you know there's so much going on it's almost not intuitive how to move around the app you know so prettiness comes in handy with actual you know efficiency and results for that app so that's why we wanna you know actually focus on that evernote instagram dropbox uber twitter post mates meetup paypal and salesforce are some of the companies that use that you want to expound on this oh dang yeah yeah so another another trend that's been up and coming uh recently so a little history lesson too so if you guys didn't know um guys also sorry aaron um don't spam the chat because i'm gonna block you you know we're all here to learn and it's it's very annoying when somebody's just you know spamming same comment over and over so you know trying to deliver value here what is ponder let's take it serious let's let's do something that can change our lives guys so come on let's say we were adults here enjoy but what were you saying about it single page yeah so single page website so for you guys who don't know this is another um thing that has been implemented a lot recently it's a big trend over the last few years and going into the future this is going to be catching on more and more and it's another responsive thing so make your websites a lot more responsive so what this is is uh back in the day like when it never first started up right everything was everything's built on html and css i think most people know that if you're watching this video so uh the way it works is you like fetch a page and then you click the link and then it'll go fetch more html from the from the server right over and over again um but that takes a lot of time because it's like a lot of back and forth so there's a thing called single page websites that's been catching on recently and yeah on um websites like facebook google twitter like like the you know like the big mega powerhouse kind of websites and services and uh the idea is instead of like keep like talking to the server okay you guys hear the dog barking in the background i think some dogs it's upstairs and you can hear all the way here these microphones were that good but yeah so single page application websites are also known as spas spas yeah if you've ever heard that acronym before but basically all it is is just saying instead of like keep uh contacting the server over and over again just kind of like load all of it um pretty much at one time into one single mega page and then just kind of like as you click on stuff just kind of like get different segments of that so you really only contact the server like one time and then it makes it so much faster because you're not like back and forth back and forth you just get it all at one time and then you can kind of dynamically load it so uh google uses this i mean you can't really see it like on the surface level but under the hood it's implemented that way and that's how it can be so fast uh things like google facebook like as you click links and stuff like it loads a lot faster because then it doesn't have to like keep accessing the server database exactly so i didn't actually listed it here because i was going to list examples of multipage applications i actually think i might have skipped it but you know in general multipage applications are more like ecommerce websites such as amazon ebay all of these that actually have a bunch of sites or websites put together and you go like if you click a button or a link it might take you to an interwebs or a sub website sub domain of that website and here on the on the single page applications everything is handled on the same actual loaded website on your computer like aaron was saying but you know it is part of the development world right now it's kind of what is in i'd say you know get inspiration from the best companies that are out right now so another big point that we wanted to hit as well is chatbots and ai and as you can see here it's funny because like somebody put the adobe illustrator logo here for ai which is maybe they didn't know or something i mean they probably use google search like oh ai and then they found adobe illustrator but i mean it gets the message across yeah so right here they're explaining like uh they're saying when it comes to responses while an interface just presents options within with an ai chatbot you can type in your own answer so the cool thing about this man is like for example if you're having a service website or you know you deliver some kind of product anything like that we use it we use actual you know chat bots in our company you know cleverprogrammer.com if you check it out we got a chatbot there that you know they they serve different you know functions so for example you can collect data from the people that are going into your website i think one of the questions that we had is are you a beginner in programming are you intermediate or advanced you know so it's cool because you can get to know the people that visit your website a little bit more maybe you know make your product more towards them and another way to do it is in it's huge here it's customer support so ai and chat bots are used immensely in customer support you can see it in a bunch of websites so i know a lot of big websites even like youtube i believe doesn't have customer support so it'd be awesome if they can just have like a very intelligent chatbot yeah yeah so again remember the trifecta needs to be pretty responsive needs to be intelligent so um it needs to have all three you want to be like visually appealing to not lose people's patience but also needs to like make freaking sense yeah like get a tangible thing done for the user so things like chatbots and ai and then even things like recommended you know like on netflix and amazon they have recommended items yes so aaron was actually studying ai in georgia tech right yeah i was and then then i stopped to work here yeah so that was this guy deep into that world you know he was mentioning the recommended algorithms on netflix yeah yeah so stuff like this i mean like people probably already know about this i mean like every like software nowadays has an algorithm youtube algorithm you know it feeds you videos you've seen before netflix tells you your recommended shows right instagram shows you oh this these pictures you might like um and uh stuff like even like targeted ads you know like as people are clicking on stuff they start getting targeted by these ads so this is what i mean by intelligent apps you definitely want to have some kind of um algorithmic aspect to your apps to make it like really good yeah it's like i feel a little bit betrayed yeah i feel i feel a little bit betrayed when i don't see like for example if you're using any video website any any website in general and that like you use it a lot and they cannot recommend you know things that you already look for in that website as in like you know like how annoying would youtube be if like you're watching you're watching a bunch of like content that you really like right like uh whatever like let's say i'm watching sewing videos i don't actually watch sewing videos but like let's say i'm super into sewing let's just say i'm super into something yeah and hypothetically speaking hypothetically i'm just hypothetical but um i want to be seeing more sewing videos but if you just kept showing me like car videos or like dog videos over and over just random videos and it never caught on to my trend i'd be like what the heck youtube like okay cool you just told me random stuff show me more sewing show me how to knit show me how to use a sewing machine show me how to uh do hand sewing like and the cool thing about that is for example whatever it's um it's good because it makes you feel like you're one your experience of that website is personalized two it's not only does it like help me as a user the thing is that you as a website developer you know you want people to actually use the websites so you know people are going to lean towards your website if there it has an algorithm that recognizes its searches or things that you know other for example like spotify this is how i get to know a bunch of different new songs you know they recommend me songs that are similar to the songs that i listen to and then my they give me so much value by knowing by getting to know different types of music so not only is it very efficient for users to keep using your website or app but also it's um was it going to say it's it's damn i completely blanked out from my i lost my train of thought something else yeah i mean i was i was just saying how important it is um you know people are going to use it more and and actually it's it's almost this is what i was going to say so people don't like stupid apps it's like smart standard nowadays dude like it's it's now part of everything it should be part of everything pretty much so just moving forward a little bit about you know chat bots here's an example of how it would work as i was mentioning maybe customer support would be a good example of this so examples yeah just like communicating communicating with uh with the user in some intelligent way using a chatbot but then also just being intelligent in in a way like using like algorithms to do recommending stuff like pick up pick up their preferences and stuff like that correct yeah and we were watching a video by demind i believe and like i said you know we were talking about trends but ultimately it is going to be principles and the cool thing about this is that we do want to start out with foundations because man if you're looking for trends all the time and like i said this is based more of principles rather than trends but if you're looking for trends all the time you have to know the foundations for you to exploit those trends and some of the foundations with web development would be oh yeah so like okay really real real quick i see a lot of people in the comments are saying mern and mean um if you guys want those are then yeah these are huge trends as you can see we've been dropping a lot of mern stack stuff um recently and we're going to be continuing to do this into 2020 um 2021 and going forward um so mern and mean is just like using react and angular and some other stuff that we'll talk about in a bit but those are like the huge huge trends as well they're gonna tie in but to prelude that uh yeah you didn't you do need to know your basics so anybody who doesn't uh if you're watching this video and you're like oh trends uh it doesn't matter if you know the trends if you don't know the basics so you gotta learn html css and javascript first because that's kind of what everything's built on so we're just mentioning that i mean probably obvious but it's good to just mention i feel your voice going in and out a little bit yeah i don't know what's up with this because when you when you're silent it kind of kills the sound and then when you start start talking it like it it turns out for me but anyways those are the the actual foundations of web development and css to begin with is pretty much it's the pretty part of web development right so you know learn how to use different layouts of websites flexbox it's a great library for css as well as you know css is used a lot now for responsive design and like aaron was saying we're dropping a bunch of value bombs during our you know mern stacks or just you know the what is it the firebase with react you know tutorials and builds that we're dropping as well all of those things you know go deep into css and we use it in very responsive manners so if you guys are enjoying this content and you want to see something a little bit more technical then go into those videos and actually get those builds done and put them on your portfolio yeah pretty much all the apps we're building are trendy apps by definition so i mean we're talking about it here on a high level but if you actually just wanted to see examples and we built all those clones like these things going forward like by definition they're trendy because these websites are trendy yeah so like if you do what they do and you understand what they've built then that's great so yeah mern marin is very big um uh and we use a lot of firebase is firebase isn't part of marine one thing yeah mern is what mongodb express js um reacts and uh node.js and then mean is the anc the same thing but with angular instead of react so those two are are definitely big and keep an eye on those and we'll talk about those in a second beautiful and you know js is a huge part of the basics as well and js normally is the portion of you know the thing that takes action so a video playing so an image popping up anything that requires you know some movement is js everything else like html would be what wait on the website html would be what oh yeah it's just a structure i mean yeah if you guys i think most people know but html just like defines all the different parts of the website and then you have it all there then css makes it all like pretty the way presented and js is just like how do you like interact with the page and a simple way to think about it too is html is more text oriented css is more color oriented and js is more action oriented so these are a bunch of things that you can jump into regarding javascript and so those those would be the basics but you know maybe you're asking what about visual and design stuff you know maybe for all the front end developers out there you know what are the cool things that are trending right now and um a lot of people ask this question what the visual design stuff yeah so i mean what is a framework specifically a framework well yeah i mean we're talking about framers because like for the visual design stuff yeah it's like well frameworks are libraries whatever you want to call it i mean most people understand they get all worked up it's like react is a library not a framework like okay yeah you get the idea oh no it's both whatever you want to call it it's a thing that you can add on on top of javascript and html to um to make cool websites so yeah framework is just like an extension so i mean the main three we're gonna be talking about are react view and angular right yeah so so for example it's like if you're building websites and you're going to want to use you're you're building multiple websites you're going to want to use a slideshow on your website let's just say that instead of coding like instead of coding it from scratch what you want to do is you know people that build websites pretty much have code that they had already used in a specific sense as in like maybe a function or utility like a slideshow like i was mentioning people already build these type of things and those things are a framework so if you're wanting to build a web you know a responsive website there's frameworks for that so if you want to build maybe you know an android app there's frameworks for that and frameworks are pretty much specific code snippets or or actual you know functions that you can use so going deeper into frameworks these are some of the bigger ones right now and web development so angular is huge you know it's one of the biggest ones right now google as you can see google mr google there it was developed by google it has a version one and version two right now well obviously it's a version two and it got a little bit less complicated in version two i don't even i don't want to go so deep into it as we do mention in other videos and you know vue is is a very good one as well all of these are frontend frameworks yeah view is kind of the lagger though right now i feel like angular is is bigger than view it's used by more more people but i mean it's good to know um if you know all three i mean then you're pretty flying hive when it comes to like using frameworks and frontend design and stuff and then these of course and work into like the tech stacks where you're talking about like merge stacks and mean stacks so you're definitely gonna want to know um one two or three of these so view is also very new i think it's the newest one of them all right now and i think vue was made by a google employee if i'm not mistaken i actually don't even know though it's incorrect behind it yeah yeah it's super new yeah but a lot of people are leaning towards it i know it's catching up i know i watched a video by stefan mischook i believe it's yeah his name yeah this guy's cool he's like calm and intense just yeah i love him he has a bunch of experience he was saying that he himself prefers view um but it still needs to catch up so another cool one obviously that you guys know yeah from us a lot of clever programmer and papa react you guys know sunday react sunny what is up sonny how are we doing bro he's he's it's really he's really just zuckerberg you know but he with a with a mask on yeah that's him react yeah so we got a bunch of builds with react if you guys want to check them out on the channel react is huge right now there's a lot of market share for web development in react and huge companies like this kind of king right now angular is pretty good too but i mean react is like really catching on and it's so powerful like we created all the clones with react and firebase like we weren't even using for like a full merm stack or anything it was just pure react and firebase for a lot of it right so fast man yeah and it's just good like you can just kill it like firebase is a big trend too right yeah i mean we're going to talk about that exactly and we'll expand on that a little bit more so we'll react was created by facebook just like angular was created by google and here's an example of the one inside the cute little table or apps that use you know react so so angular.js the guardian which is one of the biggest you know news companies in the world right now uses angularjs upwork one of the biggest freelancing websites in the world paypal obviously you guys know paypal you know it's uh processing payments sony cool i think i believe sony is a chinese web um company japanese it's japanese pretty sure it's japanese whoa yeah yeah oh yeah japanese that's true sorry guys apologize for my ignorance airbnb uses react we built the airbnb clone instagram uses react uber eats oh beautiful i mean yeah like big things use these frameworks i mean like exactly pretty much every website uses javascript nowadays like oh every website like it's crazy it's just like a given at this point but i mean these frameworks like add a layer of um flexibility and uh like like power behind even that more so like these these websites are utilizing these frameworks to like make the websites really really uh responsive and pretty and intelligent yeah and although they are i mean not intelligent you know although they are um what's it called like front end you know framework grammarly uses this in grammarly like i don't see it have so much like ui or anything yeah i mean yeah i guess like view like what is it what is what is ipl dashboard i don't that is i don't know exactly um yeah you guys heard of those but i mean you can kind of see angular reactions that's kind of the bigger yeah oh my god all the express in alibaba right so now yeah let's talk about data oh yeah so going back to like the um response i think it's more like in the responsiveness part right yeah so like yeah they go into data so you want to explain a little bit about this yeah so um if you guys don't know there's something called sql so this is uh it stands for structured query language and all this means is a way to have your data in a database so of course everybody knows like storing data and databases is pretty much required when you are creating apps uh especially web apps because you want to store some kind of data like oh what's in the cart what's the catalog of all the products et cetera yada yada or your whole your social media profile um so there's this thing called sql structured query language which just kind of allows us to structure our data in a database which was kind of which is kind of the traditional way of housing a data in a database which is nice everything's nice and organized um but you're kind of like stuck to a structure and um recently what's been caching a little bit more uh nowadays is something called no sql which kind of just allows you to just dog pile a bunch of data usually in the form of json into um some database without worrying about like all the structures and having everything like oh this this record points to this record that points to this record that points to this record like it gets too complicated versus no sql where you can just be like here's a gigantic thing of json in here you just like dump everything in and then just get kind of like more fluid about it so like i guess you can kind of say sq is like the the structured organized approach and the note sql is just kind of like yo just put everything in here and just get smart about sifting through it quickly yeah it's also high level explanation it's also cool because like sql or sql um is a language pretty much and i guess for no sql databases you don't really need sql you really need to know sql i i bet you use sql to you know query through different searches that you want to do on these nonsql databases but all in all it's not tied up just to sql the sql language so that's an example of nosql yeah oh okay so here's a little graphic what is a nosql database um yeah pretty much so like i already touched on all these in the previous slide just now about nosql databases because you're not limited to like some kind of structured data that you can get faster performance easy replication because you can just kind of just like chunk everything together more bigger data capacity i mean big big data capability because you can just like put a bunch in there scalability uh that high scalability that ties into the big um capability uh and all that it's just it's just easier like we don't have to worry about um like oh having the structured language sounds good yeah okay i don't know if the audio is cutting i know my mic is kind of weird but i feel like they can hear me um yes a lot of people using nosql databases ask if they're they're actually scalable and you know other and we're about to mention a few of them you know firebase is a very known one i was talking to a developer mongodb yeah which is part of the stack is the leading no sql database so that's one of the big trends that's where i'm mentioning this because going to 2021 like you need to know you're murdering your mean you definitely don't know do we even put that in here i don't think we put it in the slides though i mean just we didn't mention this yeah listen listen to us the mern and the mean which ties into because that allows you to create um uh like just pretty apps that are intelligent and they are responsive and all that using these tech stacks exactly and like i was saying right now i was talking to a developer and he was mentioning to me that sometimes firebase is not you know used by bigger you know tech companies right now just because a lot of companies don't want to be tied up to a google ecosystem of their database and their whole tech firebase is from google right yeah firebase is from google and you know other like bigger scalable projects right now are using sql so sql is very used but you know the whole trend the whole movement is is going yeah it's living out because uh these merge stacks are just so powerful having like crossplatform capability like you can you can actually prioritize the mobile design going forward and then they also have like uh web apps that work on all different screen sizes and stuff um and then like you just have like the powerhouse and the the ease of implementation using the react and angular frameworks slash libraries whatever you want to call it uh and um node.js like you can house all your data on the backend and mongodb like like basically these tech stacks are the trends like the biggest ones that are coming up um but you uh you definitely want to um start transitioning to an oc yeah yeah yeah pretty much i mean just just learn mongodb you just learn learning just learn it check out our yesterday we went live david went live showing i believe was part two of the facebook clone and that uses the mern stack and it's awesome man that it the front end looks amazing so check that out you know this is an example of how it's used i feel like we already talked about this yeah so no sequels used more for gaming social i don't really know what l iot is yeah internet of things oh yeah yeah internet of things web mobile enterprise and it uses a key value store document base and column family store on nosql databases and on sql databases it's more like for web or mobile or big enterprises as i was mentioning and it also uses relational table storage i mean there's some overlap here like web is on both enterprise on both mobiles on both i think what they're trying to say mainly is the bottom there's like relationships between the data everything's like kind of tied together in this way and it can get complicated versus just like um no sql use like chunk at all like like i said like it's a dog pile of data so you can get smart about sifting through and then it's just so much easier like um easier to scale so this is more linear and this is more you know i guess it goes pretty much yeah yeah anything goes and you know just chunk it in as long as it's json just chuck it in bro yeah we'll be fine we'll figure it out so aaron was mentioning this is one of the most famous you know no sequel databases right now yeah mongodb is a big one so that's why is um the m in mern and mean so for mongodb so definitely learn this going forward in 2021 catch our murder clones that david and sonia have been doing in recent weeks for those and just like brush up on these and guys if you guys are enjoying the content right now we are at 134 likes on this video that is amazing let's try to get to 150 likes let's get it guys thank you thank you guys so much for being here so firebase is another big you know no sql database right now in the industry and yeah you love this this isn't part of murder mean um but we've been using it recently uh first of all because sunny's a badass using react and firebase together so this is kind of like its own little mini tech stack so you should learn merin and mean but also learn firebase because um it's just so powerful like the netflix sloan was powered by it um i don't know what other clones i haven't seen all sony's clones but i know a lot of them pretty much almost all of them are using firebase and it's it's a it's a really really hot trend it just makes it so easy to handle your data in your databases um so in addition to mern and mean definitely learn firebase we should we should uh um i have our own tech stack like r like rf react react firebase oh yeah yeah yeah rf that's cool we're an rf guys for tony the cool thing about the sunny way the cool thing about firebase is that it's very easy to implement i've seen sony implemented i myself don't have much experience with yeah or anything at all yeah but you know i know it's one of the trending nosql databases but i've seen the setup of it and it's so easy it's so user friendly so smooth it's like pretty much plug and play colleen colleen exactly so these are the bigger names and you know there's a little conclusion here for you guys yeah yeah pretty much i just want to recover again so basically the main takeaways are uh yeah definitely learn your mirn your mean and your your firebase along with that um but the idea the biggest trends when it comes to like a high level remember like do mobile first because most people um are on their phones nowadays and that's only going to increase going forward as the i mean there's new smartphones coming out every year you know like apple's releasing their new iphone in what month probably less than a month i think so i mean they always leak i don't know probably something like that but i mean the idea is you know like smartphones ain't going away and then um you know ar and vr is coming later too but just focus on moa for now uh the other important thing is just having it cross platform so this is where um the merin and mean come in come in handy because uh you're able to create um apps that are just like good across every platform so martin is for mongodb right so that allows you to house your data really well um e is the express js which is uh i believe it allows you to house data for the mobile stuff um a lot and then uh reactor angular is for the nice pretty front end and then node.js just allows you to hold your data as well so crossplatform specifically is you can use it in a lot of different mediums yeah i'm just we're just mentioning that because uh you want to make sure that your apps work everywhere or if it works on a different screen sizes crossplatform just means like oh does it work on the web does work on your phone does it work on your is your local app all that stuff uh but just make sure that you are prioritizing mobile first because that's the biggest trend that's happening here and then also make sure it's class platform but using mern and mean uh kind of covers that cross platform for you it's just it makes it nice and easy and then uh again remember the trifecta make sure your apps are responsive make sure they're pretty make sure they're intelligent uh in order to for it to be a good opportunity people aren't going to want to use your like just make sure it has all three exactly exactly so that's a good baseline for you guys to base yourself upon yeah you know responsive pretty intelligent are then using what i mean rpi or rip only love it love it yeah so let me see what you guys are saying on the comments do we see any cool comment um i would some do say i would use laravel php and node so all of those things you know guys you know do implement them right now they are trends like i said based on principles and if you guys see websites that have these points you're gonna see how better it is to use those type of websites for example single page applications or realtime website applications or you know yeah i mean okay so we mentioned the single page applications like when you use like angular and react basically this response of this stuff is built in it's baked in so we mentioned these trends but the best way to actually implement these trends is again just use mern mean and rf the the react fire yeah it'll it'll be responsive by definition um you have all of like the mobile uh functionality and everything you have like the cross platform capability all through those tech stacks that's the point of a tech stack is just being jack like across all these things that matter and um the only thing that we kind of didn't really talk too much about is the intelligent part like actually adding an algorithm stuff you're going to know something you know some python um probably to get to get all that implemented but uh that's also important too but i mean arguably that might be the hardest one yep yep so all right guys that was pretty much the whole list for you guys like i said do implement this if you guys are enjoying this content make sure to smash that like button subscribe to the channel also check out the other builds that aaron was talking about all the mern stack builds that we have been dropping these past weeks and everything even the older well i say older but it's like a month old you know all the apps that we were building as well sunny and qazi were building i think it was facebook you know google freaking instagram tinder all of these huge websites that are trending right now we show you exactly step by step how to build their interfaces and if you guys want to become a javascript developer make sure to hit the link in the description below so you guys can see how we built netflix and we've seen so many students you know build these type of builds put them on the portfolio and actually land jobs so you know if you take it serious if you do just you know want to step a little bit back from the theory and actually get into practice it's a great way to start especially if you want to learn web development yep awesome thank you guys for watching this was frankie this was aaron and um yep just remember uh pretty responsive intelligent our burn and mean in rf that's exactly conclusion just just do that and then watch our watch our clones and you'll be pretty pretty good to go for 2021. take it easy guys thank you much thank you so much for watching this was the top web development trends in 2021 yup peace we'll see you in the next video peace guys take it easy
