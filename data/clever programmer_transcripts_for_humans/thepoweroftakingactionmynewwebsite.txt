00:00 - hey guys how's it going
00:03 - this is Kazi from clever programmer calm
00:05 - so did a lot of work today a lot but my
00:15 - new website should be up spent a lot of
00:17 - time on it before I was like you know
00:21 - hosting it with one platform now I
00:24 - switched it because of a lot of reasons
00:30 - B ok so before what was going on was I
00:33 - had you know too many websites doing too
00:38 - many different things at once
00:40 - and then what I wanted to do was make
00:43 - all of them do everything at once but
00:47 - simpler meaning that I had one website
00:50 - where I had my main website right in my
00:55 - blog posts and all of that stuff then I
00:57 - had another website where I had all of
00:59 - the courses ok now what I've done is I
01:04 - have made a website which it has the
01:07 - entire blogs and everything cool that's
01:11 - going on clever programmer there a way
01:14 - to contact me and all that as well as
01:17 - the ability for you to sign up for my
01:20 - courses and actually start taking the
01:23 - courses it's all in one place as before
01:25 - for some of the students that was
01:27 - getting lost in translation they
01:29 - couldn't find where they had to login
01:32 - and sometimes they would log in and they
01:35 - would get a problem it was like you know
01:38 - causing some problems causing some
01:40 - confusion that I don't want you to have
01:43 - so now if you go to clever programmer
01:46 - com hopefully crossing my fingers
01:48 - nothing crazy happens and embarrasses me
01:51 - you should be able to go to clever
01:53 - programmer calm you should be able to
01:55 - sign up for my free course and then it
01:57 - should send you the information for how
01:58 - to actually enroll in my free course
02:00 - also yeah and anybody who is interested
02:06 - in my new upcoming course that's coming
02:09 - up in November I'll try to put a link
02:13 - video-description or whatever but uh
02:15 - sign up for it for the VIP I call it the
02:19 - waitlist so basically you're the first
02:21 - one to get notified as well as you know
02:25 - if you join in if you sign up for it now
02:28 - I'll also send you my bonus is where I
02:29 - give you all my free resources I use to
02:33 - become a Python software developer in
02:35 - less than three months okay and all the
02:37 - resources I give you are actually free
02:40 - of cost so if you sign up for my new
02:42 - course and you're interested in it I'll
02:45 - give you a bonus in the meantime to keep
02:47 - you occupied but other than that you
02:52 - know what's going on with you guys
02:54 - hopefully everything is awesome and arm
02:59 - is kind of getting sore from holding my
03:01 - thumb for so long but you know something
03:05 - kind of interesting happened which was
03:07 - before I was about to log off for the
03:10 - night and head out and eat a thousand
03:14 - calories because right now I'm supposed
03:16 - to be eating 2,500 I'm at 1400 so I need
03:19 - to eat a lot
03:20 - I haven't eaten much today I saw a post
03:22 - by somebody named maja Han on medium.com
03:25 - and it mentioned me I was like that's
03:27 - interesting so I went over and checked
03:29 - it out and it was a really cool post and
03:34 - basically what she was saying was that
03:37 - she watched my video called successful
03:39 - people vs. lazy people that videos on
03:42 - YouTube you can go to it search it up
03:44 - but basically our video is about you
03:47 - know stopping consuming stuff and
03:50 - actually starting to create meaning like
03:54 - if you had to think about your time 90%
03:57 - of it is consuming and okay I'm probably
04:01 - being generous here for most of us let's
04:03 - be honest it's like 99% consuming and
04:06 - like one person creating if that so for
04:11 - example you know you can start doing
04:12 - like little shifts in your behavior
04:14 - patterns like small things like instead
04:17 - of spending more time watching a video
04:18 - how about spend a little bit of time
04:20 - commenting on a video so go from 99 1%
04:24 - kriya
04:25 - - maybe like two three four five percent
04:27 - creation in your day right so now you
04:30 - comment on a video and you know it
04:32 - doesn't have to be a video it's just
04:33 - that example is coming to my head
04:35 - because I'm making a youtube video right
04:37 - now but if you're on a forum or you see
04:39 - a Facebook post and you're scrolling
04:40 - through and it's one of your friends
04:41 - Facebook post she's going there and if
04:43 - you like it or something funny is there
04:46 - or you know was helpful to you
04:48 - make a comment you know or if you watch
04:50 - a vo anywhere else put a comment there
04:54 - you're maybe on a forum and you looked
04:57 - up something and there was a solution
04:59 - there on a forum go give you know go go
05:04 - to the forum reply comments you know
05:07 - engage with the community if there is no
05:11 - solution and you're the first one who's
05:13 - solving a problem post your solution
05:17 - okay a lot of the times we underestimate
05:21 - ourselves and our experiences and all
05:25 - you have to do is you know you don't
05:27 - have to be this amazing genius just
05:30 - document what's going on in your life
05:32 - right you don't have to worry about
05:33 - creating something new that's what Gary
05:34 - Vee says as well just document what's
05:37 - already going on so meaning let's say
05:39 - you're going through a current challenge
05:41 - in your life or a problem or you're
05:43 - trying to learn something just talk
05:47 - about that in a blog post okay if you're
05:50 - interested in writing write on
05:52 - medium.com it's like free it's easy to
05:55 - write and there's already audience there
05:56 - so people will find your content just
05:59 - like I found my Hawkins content you know
06:04 - right you can you can write or you can
06:07 - make a video about where you're at and
06:08 - post it on YouTube you know it doesn't a
06:12 - lot of people think you'd requires extra
06:14 - time out of the day or some kind of
06:16 - extra effort it doesn't it just means
06:18 - like that time you spend consuming you
06:21 - just replace a little bit of that with
06:22 - actually creating so let's say you were
06:26 - gonna sit and you know scroll through
06:28 - the Facebook feed for the next 30
06:30 - minutes spend 10 minutes just writing a
06:33 - little thing about your thoughts and
06:35 - posting it or
06:37 - and five minutes making a simple video
06:39 - just like I'm doing right now right but
06:41 - it's been six or seven minutes you know
06:44 - so what and now a lot of people get to
06:46 - see this video also don't worry about
06:50 - you have zero followers right now are
06:53 - zero viewers that shouldn't be the thing
06:56 - that motivates you to create this
06:58 - content you know like you have to
07:01 - understand you might look at my channel
07:03 - and be like obviously cause you're
07:04 - making this video because you have so
07:05 - many viewers well now yes I do as of now
07:09 - as of today we just hit 80 thousand
07:11 - subscribers which is pretty cool
07:12 - so thank you guys for that but I was
07:16 - making my content when I had zero
07:18 - viewers and zero subscribers because I
07:20 - just like believed that if I put
07:23 - something out there it'll help some
07:25 - people you know because I thought okay
07:28 - you know I was really stuck on certain
07:31 - things I'm just gonna start helping
07:32 - people I'll put out content and I didn't
07:34 - worry about marketing I didn't pay for
07:36 - any ads I didn't do anything fancy I
07:38 - just put it out there and I'm like if
07:41 - you know hopefully people are gonna find
07:43 - this helpful and you know a bunch of
07:46 - people did and they started finding the
07:48 - channels for gaining popularity but you
07:51 - know that's how it happened wasn't some
07:53 - amazing thing I did I just literally you
07:56 - know I was still going to college I was
07:58 - still going to you know hanging out with
08:01 - friends family it was still watched
08:03 - Netflix I would still do all those
08:05 - things but then instead of spending you
08:08 - know 30 minutes extra or two hours extra
08:10 - doing those things I just said okay let
08:12 - me take that one or two hours out and
08:15 - just make a video and then post it on
08:18 - it's fun and I have a chance of being
08:21 - discovered you know it's just their
08:24 - chance of being discovered it's cool and
08:27 - you know imagine like somebody was
08:29 - trying to hire you who would they hire
08:31 - somebody who let's say you're trying to
08:33 - hire somebody would you want to hire
08:34 - somebody who just like fits a very basic
08:38 - criteria for a job or would you hire
08:40 - somebody who is so passionate about it
08:42 - that in their free time they have videos
08:44 - or that or they have a website about
08:46 - that subject so if you want to call a
08:47 - programmer you know you don't
08:49 - necessarily need
08:50 - degree or anything if you have a website
08:53 - you have a platform or you have
08:55 - something where you creating content and
08:57 - people can see it you're you're gonna
08:59 - get people to reach out to and want to
09:04 - hire you and you'll just stand out like
09:06 - for example just a few days ago I got a
09:08 - job offer for about 100k for a Python
09:11 - and I turned down the offer because I'm
09:17 - at a point where I'm actually more
09:19 - interested I need more time to create
09:21 - content for you guys and help you guys
09:22 - out and one thing I'm realizing is that
09:25 - it's not even necessarily like I need to
09:29 - help you guys with just coding you know
09:32 - one thing I'm realizing is that
09:33 - knowledge is not what's stopping a lot
09:35 - of us right knowledge it's not knowledge
09:38 - that we need it's actually behavioral
09:41 - change motivation the right guidance to
09:44 - get started and I feel like that's where
09:47 - I can actually be more helpful because
09:50 - there are tons of tutorials there's tons
09:52 - of guys it tons of how-tos
09:54 - but not a lot of people make the big
09:56 - picture connection of why software
09:58 - development why programming you know
10:01 - what are the big picture like nobody
10:05 - even mentions or at least not anywhere
10:08 - that I seen you know their online
10:09 - courses and they have content where they
10:14 - don't even assume that you have a job or
10:16 - you're not busy currently in your life
10:19 - you know it's almost like they just
10:23 - assume everybody's like a student and
10:25 - they have like nothing going on in their
10:27 - lives so they'll make really dense
10:29 - technical content without explaining any
10:32 - of the like you know big picture like
10:34 - when should you start freelancing when
10:36 - should you start becoming a full-time
10:37 - developer or how do you know you're
10:38 - ready where can you go to start getting
10:42 - clients all those things right they
10:43 - don't mention that they'll just have
10:44 - this dense content and if you're busy
10:47 - you likely don't have how much time
10:49 - available at your hands right you have a
10:51 - very little bit of time so again those
10:54 - are the things that I found more
10:56 - important that need to be addressed that
10:58 - aren't addressed so that's where
10:59 - actually I'm going to be focusing a lot
11:01 - on and you know my future of content is
11:03 - going to
11:03 - coming out you can expect a lot of that
11:05 - to be there and you know let me know if
11:07 - you guys find this stuff helpful because
11:09 - yeah I want to make like really
11:11 - technical videos but I don't think that
11:14 - that's what's stopping a lot of us I
11:17 - really don't think so I think we know
11:19 - where we can find the resources and
11:21 - stuff I think it's that we have
11:23 - sometimes trouble about like visioning
11:28 - how software development or programming
11:30 - will help improve our lives if we are
11:33 - able to become a developer if it's
11:35 - something that we will actually even
11:37 - like in the future right so that's what
11:40 - I want to focus on the most and I didn't
11:43 - discover this till later right so if you
11:48 - guys are making your channels and
11:49 - everything or you're making your content
11:51 - or you're writing a blog post or
11:53 - whatever it is that you're doing right
11:55 - in any shape form you're contributing
11:57 - you don't have to have this whole game
11:59 - plan or this whole thing mapped out just
12:02 - you can figure it out as you go you
12:04 - don't need some amazing stuff already
12:06 - they're just like start and then you get
12:10 - search steering in different directions
12:12 - based on what people want from you what
12:16 - people like from you things like that
12:19 - okay so just my two cents
12:23 - a little bit tired a new website is
12:26 - coming up check it out let me know what
12:27 - you guys think if there any bugs or
12:29 - anything please comment and let me know
12:30 - like hey something's messed up so I can
12:32 - fix it or something doesn't make sense
12:34 - please let me know that in the comments
12:36 - below I really want to make sure that
12:38 - this website is like awesome on point
12:41 - and everybody loves it you guys love it
12:43 - mmm yeah doing just for you guys let me
12:46 - know and again let's go from there okay
12:49 - in the meantime comment enjoy and if you
12:55 - have an idea about something you know
12:57 - write it down and amazing blogging
13:00 - platform medium comm completely free you
13:02 - can get started today and if you write a
13:04 - post you tag me in it let me know I'll
13:06 - come in I'll comment on it and I'll give
13:08 - you a shout out as well because I know
13:11 - 99.9% of the people don't take action
13:14 - only like one
13:16 - less than 1% do okay eat that 1% thank
13:19 - you so much for watching as always I
13:22 - love your faces off and I'll see you in
13:25 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm so did a lot of work today a lot but my new website should be up spent a lot of time on it before I was like you know hosting it with one platform now I switched it because of a lot of reasons B ok so before what was going on was I had you know too many websites doing too many different things at once and then what I wanted to do was make all of them do everything at once but simpler meaning that I had one website where I had my main website right in my blog posts and all of that stuff then I had another website where I had all of the courses ok now what I've done is I have made a website which it has the entire blogs and everything cool that's going on clever programmer there a way to contact me and all that as well as the ability for you to sign up for my courses and actually start taking the courses it's all in one place as before for some of the students that was getting lost in translation they couldn't find where they had to login and sometimes they would log in and they would get a problem it was like you know causing some problems causing some confusion that I don't want you to have so now if you go to clever programmer com hopefully crossing my fingers nothing crazy happens and embarrasses me you should be able to go to clever programmer calm you should be able to sign up for my free course and then it should send you the information for how to actually enroll in my free course also yeah and anybody who is interested in my new upcoming course that's coming up in November I'll try to put a link videodescription or whatever but uh sign up for it for the VIP I call it the waitlist so basically you're the first one to get notified as well as you know if you join in if you sign up for it now I'll also send you my bonus is where I give you all my free resources I use to become a Python software developer in less than three months okay and all the resources I give you are actually free of cost so if you sign up for my new course and you're interested in it I'll give you a bonus in the meantime to keep you occupied but other than that you know what's going on with you guys hopefully everything is awesome and arm is kind of getting sore from holding my thumb for so long but you know something kind of interesting happened which was before I was about to log off for the night and head out and eat a thousand calories because right now I'm supposed to be eating 2,500 I'm at 1400 so I need to eat a lot I haven't eaten much today I saw a post by somebody named maja Han on medium.com and it mentioned me I was like that's interesting so I went over and checked it out and it was a really cool post and basically what she was saying was that she watched my video called
