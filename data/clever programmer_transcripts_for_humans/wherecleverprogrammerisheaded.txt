00:00 - hi there my beautiful people how are you
00:04 - doing today I'm gonna wait for a few
00:10 - people to jump on because we are live
00:12 - but today I just kind of want to share
00:14 - I'm feeling inspired
00:16 - I am currently coming to you live from
00:20 - Boise Idaho I'm here for the convertkit
00:22 - conference and it's a bunch of online
00:28 - marketers and we get together in one
00:31 - place but it's more than that it's
00:33 - business owners and hi zakir Talib and I
00:37 - fury nice to see you guys here and it is
00:43 - honestly just inspired me to jump on and
00:46 - speak to you guys because over the last
00:48 - few months
00:49 - I'm not producing a lot of content on
00:52 - YouTube I'm creating content for the
00:56 - course the profitable programmer but it
00:59 - takes up all of the time and so there
01:02 - hasn't been a lot of YouTube content and
01:04 - every time I think about creating
01:07 - content or coming out and speaking to
01:09 - you guys I'm like no it has to be like
01:12 - perfect and I can't just go up there and
01:15 - speak to them they won't find what I say
01:19 - interesting or they won't find value in
01:22 - it and a lot of these thoughts jump into
01:27 - my head and they freeze me from taking
01:28 - action hence it's been months and I
01:31 - haven't spoken with any of you however
01:34 - today I was feeling inspired and I was
01:38 - like screw that and I'm just gonna come
01:40 - on jump on and speak with you guys and
01:44 - kind of share with you we're clever
01:47 - programmer is headed and a vision and I
01:51 - really need your help as well and that's
01:57 - awesome junior bahai he says you made me
01:59 - fall in love with Python and you know
02:01 - what I'm realizing is maybe that's just
02:03 - it maybe that's just my mission if I can
02:06 - just have people fall in love with
02:08 - coding and that's enough
02:11 - but the ultimate vision were what I'm
02:14 - thinking about and please if you're on
02:15 - this channel you know offer me your
02:17 - suggestions or put it in the comment I
02:19 - want us to come up with a vision
02:22 - together and if you can help me in any
02:24 - way that'd be fantastic I really need
02:27 - your feedback on this because it's kind
02:30 - of been tearing me up and I've been
02:31 - thinking about it right for example last
02:34 - month I got sick I got bronchitis and
02:39 - for the whole month because I was sick I
02:43 - couldn't produce any new content and
02:46 - pretty much everything came to a
02:48 - screeching halt now that's a scary thing
02:53 - when you think about it because for me
02:57 - clever programmer wasn't ever about me
02:59 - the reason why I started clever
03:01 - programmer was because I genuinely think
03:03 - the whole world should know how to code
03:06 - and coding should actually be part of
03:10 - every school system yes I know Cory
03:12 - Shafer he's awesome guy
03:14 - coding should be part of like every
03:16 - school system and it should be one of
03:18 - the core subjects taught right next to
03:20 - math taught right next to history that
03:23 - has been the vision but what I've come
03:26 - to realize was when I got sick and my
03:30 - immortality was questioned I mean I
03:32 - wasn't gonna die not even close to it so
03:34 - I'm being a little dramatic but it made
03:35 - me think about my own mortality and kind
03:38 - of you know me being the biggest
03:41 - bottleneck and I'm like I can't do this
03:44 - alone
03:45 - I need help and clever programmers a
03:50 - team needs to grow a lot bigger we have
03:51 - some people on the team but we don't
03:54 - have a lot of developers on the team and
03:58 - what would be incredible is if clever
04:02 - programmer turns into a platform for
04:05 - passionate developers what do you think
04:09 - about that Zaki Khalifa everybody who's
04:11 - here
04:12 - I will read every single one of your
04:14 - messages okay and I will reply back to
04:16 - them as well but what do you think about
04:19 - that like that clever programmer turns
04:21 - into a platform for a passionate
04:23 - developers
04:24 - meaning people who are passionate about
04:28 - coding people who are passionate about
04:30 - this world and they get to use this
04:34 - platform to teach other people because
04:37 - it shouldn't just be me right it should
04:39 - be way bigger than myself a lot of
04:42 - people maybe don't resonate with my
04:43 - teaching style and so by having it be
04:48 - this one place where somebody could
04:50 - teach about you know there was a
04:53 - somebody I'm talking to right now who is
04:58 - interested in thank you i fury for that
05:01 - feedback you lot says yes awesome hi
05:04 - frost killer I am in Boise Idaho my
05:08 - friend but I'm just on like a quieter
05:10 - place so I can speak with you
05:12 - Zacky thank you for that he says that
05:14 - would be cool so I've been speaking to
05:16 - somebody and multiple people and one of
05:18 - them is interested in Huber passionate
05:21 - about machine learning she's leading
05:22 - some movements on machine learning she's
05:24 - running conventions like PI data PyCon
05:28 - initiative is amazing super passionate
05:30 - and it's like if she could have the
05:33 - platform right to teach and speak about
05:37 - machine learning and Python wouldn't
05:40 - that be fantastic what some of you guys
05:41 - be interested in learning machine
05:43 - learning you know and if we have other
05:46 - developers who want to learn or who want
05:48 - to teach about something else that'd be
05:49 - fantastic too if you are a developer or
05:53 - you know somebody who's a developer
05:55 - please send me an email at support at
05:58 - clever programmer comm and get in touch
06:02 - with our team okay get in touch with our
06:05 - team get in touch with me I want to give
06:08 - every passionate developer a voice I
06:12 - want this platform to give that voice
06:15 - and the vision for clever programmer is
06:17 - to be bigger than the whole world it's a
06:19 - movement that wants to teach the whole
06:23 - world to code because I fundamentally
06:25 - believe that's where the world is headed
06:27 - and it can help anyone in every
06:29 - direction of life and specially children
06:32 - learning it the logical skills it bills
06:35 - very very powerful
06:37 - for me I couldn't even understand math
06:41 - till I started learning coding and I
06:43 - couldn't even understand physics but I
06:45 - used coding to create things I simulated
06:48 - those mathematical equations or physics
06:50 - and it helped me understand it let's go
06:52 - I see it
06:54 - why shooting at 45 degrees will always
06:57 - let you go the farthest versus like 90
06:59 - degrees or 180 degrees that would be
07:02 - terrible if you shot like that so that's
07:07 - kind of what I wanted to share with you
07:08 - guys the overall vision where things are
07:11 - headed why I haven't been on the
07:13 - platform for a while I'm also moving to
07:16 - Columbia which is gonna take place very
07:20 - soon so between that and creating
07:23 - content for the profitable programmer
07:25 - I'm not gonna be creating too much
07:28 - content in YouTube because I want to
07:29 - make sure the content is one great and
07:31 - two I want to get leaders to lead on
07:34 - this platform and that is like the big
07:38 - big vision after the content and the
07:41 - course is done the profitable programmer
07:44 - and everything else I want to jump in
07:46 - and obviously be creating a lot more
07:48 - content but in the meantime I'll be
07:50 - going live here with you guys when will
07:52 - you be again live I'll try to go live
07:56 - for you god you know I'll try to go live
07:57 - a little bit more because I haven't been
07:59 - doing that and that's easiest and it's
08:01 - the best way for me to get in touch with
08:03 - you and you know if you have any
08:06 - questions put them down here I'll try to
08:07 - answer them my fury ass thanks to give
08:09 - me that passion you're awesome junior
08:11 - that's awesome he just said he's coding
08:13 - it's 2:00 a.m. good job buddy I fury
08:16 - said is coding hard for a beginner it
08:20 - really depends what you're doing right
08:21 - if you're trying to kill yourself and
08:24 - just do too much and you give yourself a
08:27 - ridiculous project that there's no way
08:29 - you can do you can easily psych yourself
08:33 - out and you won't enjoy the process but
08:37 - if you focus on doing smaller things and
08:39 - take your time and enjoy the process
08:41 - have a connection of love passion energy
08:46 - excitement positive reinforcement
08:49 - attached to coding coding will become
08:53 - very easy and you'll ought to you it'll
08:55 - come very easily to you and you'll
08:56 - automatically keep wanting by yourself
08:59 - to spend more and more time into coding
09:01 - and doing more okay so that's the key I
09:07 - think okay you want to baby step
09:09 - yourself you want to baby step your way
09:12 - into it if you're a beginner Bartok asks
09:18 - why would someone share their knowledge
09:20 - via clever programmer when they can
09:21 - start their own platform that's a very
09:23 - good question essentially there is a
09:27 - business model let's hash to it right
09:28 - because at the end of the day it's an
09:31 - alt movement but it's part of a business
09:34 - right so it has to make sense for you oh
09:38 - wow awesome Cody just gave you two
09:41 - dollars that's amazing it makes me
09:42 - really happy but somebody asked that
09:44 - question I'm gonna answer that question
09:45 - first and then I'm gonna give the tips
09:48 - on Python okay and if I forget then just
09:51 - please remind me really quick okay don't
09:52 - get upset with me I forget sometimes so
09:57 - the business essentially it's like when
10:00 - people jump on right and will teach
10:02 - their content one to get exposure but
10:05 - more than that obviously they'll be part
10:07 - of the team so they'll they'll have a
10:10 - part-time or full-time position working
10:13 - with clever programmer and then if they
10:16 - create a product and lead it they will
10:19 - have a certain percentage of the revenue
10:22 - that comes from the new product that
10:25 - gets released okay so maybe it's like a
10:26 - lot of free content that they'll teach
10:28 - on YouTube and then ultimately if they
10:30 - want to make a really in-depth training
10:32 - to take you from zero to hero you know
10:35 - they'll charge for that and then they'll
10:38 - get a percentage of every single deal so
10:40 - there's incentive financially but more
10:44 - importantly financially it's like the
10:46 - people that I want to bring on the team
10:48 - are people who really believe in the
10:50 - vision and see it as something bigger
10:52 - than themselves or something that's just
10:54 - monitor
10:55 - to them right it has to be coming from a
10:57 - place of passion so yeah that's really
11:00 - the incentive for them to create your
11:03 - own platform you can do it certainly but
11:07 - automatically getting exposure to a big
11:10 - audience that takes time right it took
11:12 - me 1 and 1/2 year of what producing 200
11:15 - plus videos some of the content was
11:17 - really good few years of learning coding
11:20 - very crazily 20 hours a day so it just
11:24 - depends if you can do all of that create
11:25 - a channel go for it if you have the same
11:28 - vision for sure go for it but this is
11:30 - just a slightly easier path if your goal
11:33 - is to spread a message here is a
11:36 - platform use it use me use the clever
11:39 - programmer team and leverage this now
11:41 - I'm gonna answer the question of Cody
11:43 - Allen he said can you give some coding
11:47 - tips ok for Python coding tips I would
11:55 - say again start with really simple
11:57 - things if you're new to coding if you're
12:00 - new to Python go take my free training
12:03 - it's on YouTube it's called learn Python
12:05 - programming I believe it's the best free
12:10 - training for somebody starting to learn
12:14 - how to code in Python hands down
12:17 - somebody who doesn't have that much
12:19 - experience coding it'll teach you all of
12:23 - a lot of the fundamentals ok but other
12:25 - tips I can give you really easy to
12:29 - implement tips and they will give you a
12:31 - lot of leverage one this is like a big
12:35 - time hack so just listen up and really
12:37 - apply this one when you eat while you
12:43 - eat food watch a tutorial ok watch a
12:48 - simple easy tutorial if you're a
12:49 - beginner but just watch it in the start
12:54 - it's gonna feel like oh this is actually
12:55 - boring whatever watch something that's
12:57 - actually more interesting to you right
12:58 - but the more you surround yourself the
13:01 - more you listen to it the more you think
13:03 - about it you're gonna start to enjoy it
13:05 - more and more and is gonna start
13:07 - becoming a part of your everyday reality
13:09 - just like right now I'm heading to the
13:11 - gym I was sick for like 3040 days could
13:14 - not go to the gym and now gym is not
13:16 - really a part of my reality anymore and
13:18 - it takes a lot of hard work to do it but
13:20 - you know I'm gonna throw myself in there
13:23 - today and then that's just gonna get me
13:26 - to do it you know over time it's gonna
13:29 - build up momentum so do that watch
13:32 - coding videos watch tutorial videos and
13:35 - that's gonna really help you and then if
13:38 - you're the type of person who had night
13:40 - uses technology watch tutorials till you
13:43 - fall asleep if you use something like
13:44 - Instagram or something else till you
13:46 - fall asleep I would say used to watch
13:48 - tutorials till you fall asleep personal
13:51 - recommendation keep your phone away from
13:52 - you after 9:00 9:30 p.m. and just go to
13:56 - sleep at 10:00 p.m. no phones in your
13:58 - room start your day in the morning you
14:01 - know wake up 5:00 a.m. 6:00 a.m. that's
14:02 - the best but everybody has a routine and
14:05 - I know it's not that easy to change so
14:07 - what I'll say there is like just
14:09 - surround yourself watch more tutorials
14:10 - they'll help you a lot
14:13 - Bartek says that's great the way new
14:15 - programmers will get a chance to get
14:17 - mentored and shared knowledge 100%
14:19 - that's really the point okay nice hi
14:24 - epic code CFK hi mind pixel
14:31 - well okay folks that's really all I
14:37 - wanted to share for now the vision for
14:39 - clever programmer it turning into a
14:41 - platform for passionate developers I
14:43 - don't know yet how I'm gonna do it I
14:45 - don't know it is everybody gonna be
14:49 - speaking from the clever programmer
14:51 - platform like the same YouTube channel
14:53 - is it gonna be different YouTube
14:55 - channels you know for example like Paulo
14:58 - Rodriguez is online right now maybe
15:00 - it'll be like CP Paolo Rodriguez meaning
15:03 - clever programmer Paul Rodriguez that's
15:04 - you know if he if he jumps on it that's
15:07 - his YouTube channel for somebody else
15:09 - that'll be like CP followed by their
15:11 - name so it just maybe that's how would
15:16 - work I don't know yet but one thing I
15:19 - know is when you start like look Lao Tzu
15:24 - said this I'm gonna paraphrase it I
15:27 - don't know the exact quotes but
15:28 - essentially he says listen to your
15:31 - thoughts thoughts are very important
15:33 - control your thoughts everything start
15:34 - from thoughts your thoughts become words
15:36 - words become actions actions become
15:43 - habits habits will build your character
15:47 - and your character ultimately becomes
15:51 - your destiny
15:52 - okay so it all starts on thoughts and
15:56 - words and so right now I have fought and
15:59 - now I'm putting it into words and
16:02 - sharing it with the world sharing it
16:03 - with you and just being as transparent
16:06 - as possible and I honestly just want to
16:09 - even let you know that I have this
16:10 - vision and I don't know how it's gonna
16:13 - take form but just but by putting it out
16:15 - there sharing it with you guys maybe you
16:19 - will come up with an amazing idea and I
16:21 - can use that or maybe somehow an idea
16:24 - will be formed within me and you know
16:29 - who knows but this is just me putting it
16:33 - out there with the world and now it's a
16:35 - it's the process of the vision turning
16:38 - into a yeah there's gonna be a processor
16:41 - the vision is gonna turn into a physical
16:42 - manifestation right at some point but I
16:46 - want you to be part of that journey and
16:48 - enjoy that process and be there okay
16:51 - that's it for this video thank you for
16:55 - jumping on and giving me some of your
16:58 - time and listening in I really
17:01 - appreciate it I'm always humbled by it
17:03 - Thank You Cody Allen for the $2 donation
17:06 - it just put a smile on my face I love it
17:09 - thank you thank you and that's it I'm
17:12 - gonna head to the gym get in my lifting
17:15 - session and other than that I love you
17:19 - guys take care be safe enjoy life get
17:23 - out there the world is a huge place and
17:26 - you know if you have the time the
17:30 - capacity the money the energy to travel
17:32 - please do because I'm only in Boise
17:35 - Idaho and already I'm producing content
17:38 - and speaking and I have like I feel like
17:40 - my drive back whereas when I was just
17:43 - staying in one place it was kind of
17:46 - killing me from inside so
17:49 - you know listen to yourself give
17:51 - yourself some time and you know if you
17:53 - can travel do that as well thank you
17:54 - guys take care that state as always I
17:56 - love your faces off and I'll see you in
17:58 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hi there my beautiful people how are you doing today I'm gonna wait for a few people to jump on because we are live but today I just kind of want to share I'm feeling inspired I am currently coming to you live from Boise Idaho I'm here for the convertkit conference and it's a bunch of online marketers and we get together in one place but it's more than that it's business owners and hi zakir Talib and I fury nice to see you guys here and it is honestly just inspired me to jump on and speak to you guys because over the last few months I'm not producing a lot of content on YouTube I'm creating content for the course the profitable programmer but it takes up all of the time and so there hasn't been a lot of YouTube content and every time I think about creating content or coming out and speaking to you guys I'm like no it has to be like perfect and I can't just go up there and speak to them they won't find what I say interesting or they won't find value in it and a lot of these thoughts jump into my head and they freeze me from taking action hence it's been months and I haven't spoken with any of you however today I was feeling inspired and I was like screw that and I'm just gonna come on jump on and speak with you guys and kind of share with you we're clever programmer is headed and a vision and I really need your help as well and that's awesome junior bahai he says you made me fall in love with Python and you know what I'm realizing is maybe that's just it maybe that's just my mission if I can just have people fall in love with coding and that's enough but the ultimate vision were what I'm thinking about and please if you're on this channel you know offer me your suggestions or put it in the comment I want us to come up with a vision together and if you can help me in any way that'd be fantastic I really need your feedback on this because it's kind of been tearing me up and I've been thinking about it right for example last month I got sick I got bronchitis and for the whole month because I was sick I couldn't produce any new content and pretty much everything came to a screeching halt now that's a scary thing when you think about it because

and the course is done the profitable programmer and everything else I want to jump in and obviously be creating a lot more content but in the meantime I'll be going live here with you guys when will you be again live I'll try to go live for you god you know I'll try to go live a little bit more because I haven't been doing that and that's easiest and it's the best way for me to get in touch with you and you know if you have any questions put them down here I'll try to answer them my fury ass thanks to give me that passion you're awesome junior that's awesome he just said he's coding it's 200 a.m. good job buddy I fury said is coding hard for a beginner it really depends what you're doing right if you're trying to kill yourself and just do too much and you give yourself a ridiculous project that there's no way you can do you can easily psych yourself out and you won't enjoy the process but if you focus on doing smaller things and take your time and enjoy the process have a connection of love passion energy excitement positive reinforcement attached to coding coding will become very easy and you'll ought to you it'll come very easily to you and you'll automatically keep wanting by yourself to spend more and more time into coding and doing more okay so that's the key I think okay you want to baby step yourself you want to baby step your way into it if you're a beginner Bartok asks why would someone share their knowledge via clever programmer when they can start their own platform that's a very good question essentially there is a business model let's hash to it right because at the end of the day it's an alt movement but it's part of a business right so it has to make sense for you oh wow awesome Cody just gave you two dollars that's amazing it makes me really happy but somebody asked that question I'm gonna answer that question first and then I'm gonna give the tips on Python okay and if I forget then just please remind me really quick okay don't get upset with me I forget sometimes so the business essentially it's like when people jump on right and will teach their content one to get exposure but more than that obviously they'll be part of the team so they'll they'll have a parttime or fulltime position working with clever programmer and then if they create a product and lead it they will have a certain percentage of the revenue that comes from the new product that gets released okay so maybe it's like a lot of free content that they'll teach on YouTube and then ultimately if they want to make a really indepth training to take you from zero to hero you know they'll charge for that and then they'll get a percentage of every single deal so there's incentive financially but more importantly financially it's like the people that I want to bring on the team are people who really believe in the vision and see it as something bigger than themselves or something that's just monitor to them right it has to be coming from a place of passion so yeah that's really the incentive for them to create your own platform you can do it certainly but automatically getting exposure to a big audience that takes time right it took me 1 and 1/2 year of what producing 200 plus videos some of the content was really good few years of learning coding very crazily 20 hours a day so it just depends if you can do all of that create a channel go for it if you have the same vision for sure go for it but this is just a slightly easier path if your goal is to spread a message here is a platform use it use me use the clever programmer team and leverage this now I'm gonna answer the question of Cody Allen he said can you give some coding tips ok for Python coding tips I would say again start with really simple things if you're new to coding if you're new to Python go take my free training it's on YouTube it's called learn Python programming I believe it's the best free training for somebody starting to learn how to code in Python hands down somebody who doesn't have that much experience coding it'll teach you all of a lot of the fundamentals ok but other tips I can give you really easy to implement tips and they will give you a lot of leverage one this is like a big time hack so just listen up and really apply this one when you eat while you eat food watch a tutorial ok watch a simple easy tutorial if you're a beginner but just watch it in the start it's gonna feel like oh this is actually boring whatever watch something that's actually more interesting to you right but the more you surround yourself the more you listen to it the more you think about it you're gonna start to enjoy it more and more and is gonna start becoming a part of your everyday reality just like right now I'm heading to the gym I was sick for like 3040 days could not go to the gym and now gym is not really a part of my reality anymore and it takes a lot of hard work to do it but you know I'm gonna throw myself in there today and then that's just gonna get me to do it you know over time it's gonna build up momentum so do that watch coding videos watch tutorial videos and that's gonna really help you and then if you're the type of person who had night uses technology watch tutorials till you fall asleep if you use something like Instagram or something else till you fall asleep I would say used to watch tutorials till you fall asleep personal recommendation keep your phone away from you after 900 930 p.m. and just go to sleep at 1000 p.m. no phones in your room start your day in the morning you know wake up 500 a.m. 600 a.m. that's the best but everybody has a routine and I know it's not that easy to change so what I'll say there is like just surround yourself watch more tutorials they'll help you a lot Bartek says that's great the way new programmers will get a chance to get mentored and shared knowledge 100% that's really the point okay nice hi epic code CFK hi mind pixel well okay folks that's really all I wanted to share for now the vision for clever programmer it turning into a platform for passionate developers I don't know yet how I'm gonna do it I don't know it is everybody gonna be speaking from the clever programmer platform like the same YouTube channel is it gonna be different YouTube channels you know for example like Paulo Rodriguez is online right now maybe it'll be like CP Paolo Rodriguez meaning clever programmer Paul Rodriguez that's you know if he if he jumps on it that's his YouTube channel for somebody else that'll be like CP followed by their name so it just maybe that's how would work I don't know yet but one thing I know is when you start like look Lao Tzu said this I'm gonna paraphrase it I don't know the exact quotes but essentially he says listen to your thoughts thoughts are very important control your thoughts everything start from thoughts your thoughts become words words become actions actions become habits habits will build your character and your character ultimately becomes your destiny okay so it all starts on thoughts and words and so right now I have fought and now I'm putting it into words and sharing it with the world sharing it with you and just being as transparent as possible and I honestly just want to even let you know that I have this vision and I don't know how it's gonna take form but just but by putting it out there sharing it with you guys maybe you will come up with an amazing idea and I can use that or maybe somehow an idea will be formed within me and you know who knows but this is just me putting it out there with the world and now it's a it's the process of the vision turning into a yeah there's gonna be a processor the vision is gonna turn into a physical manifestation right at some point but I want you to be part of that journey and enjoy that process and be there okay that's it for this video thank you for jumping on and giving me some of your time and listening in I really appreciate it I'm always humbled by it Thank You Cody Allen for the $2 donation it just put a smile on my face I love it thank you thank you and that's it I'm gonna head to the gym get in my lifting session and other than that I love you guys take care be safe enjoy life get out there the world is a huge place and you know if you have the time the capacity the money the energy to travel please do because I'm only in Boise Idaho and already I'm producing content and speaking and I have like I feel like my drive back whereas when I was just staying in one place it was kind of killing me from inside so you know listen to yourself give yourself some time and you know if you can travel do that as well thank you guys take care that state as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
