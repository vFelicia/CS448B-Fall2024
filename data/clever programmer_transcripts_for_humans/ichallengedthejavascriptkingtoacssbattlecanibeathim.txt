00:06 - web dev simplify and we thought hey we
00:08 - should be doing this

00:12 - who's one of the instructors here at
00:13 - clever programmer
00:15 - alright so now we are going to battle
00:18 - kazi the man himself the python
00:21 - king the python papa as we like to say
00:24 - we're going to see just how good
00:26 - his css skills against the javascript
00:29 - python
00:30 - that could be an interesting situation
00:32 - that we're going to test out
00:34 - today with this css battle right here
00:36 - and my goal is to absolutely smash his
00:39 - face in and just destroy him and wreck
00:41 - him
00:42 - like literally it's gonna be crazy okay

00:55 - curious i've done css for quite a while
00:57 - now right
00:58 - and i have some good knowledge of that
01:00 - but the issue with me personally is the
01:02 - fact that
01:02 - well you know i don't know any of those
01:04 - like really fancy css i know how to
01:06 - build websites with css but when it
01:07 - comes to crazy css

01:12 - little tiny disclaimer i
01:14 - absolutely um suck at css i'm hoping

01:40 - minutes wins so at 4 37 p.m we're gonna
01:43 - put a stop and see how close we got
01:45 - hopefully we'll be able to get it
01:46 - hopefully i'll be able to get it and
01:47 - hopefully cause it doesn't you know
01:50 - with that said let's just jump straight
01:52 - into it hey siri set a timer for 10
01:54 - minutes
01:56 - hey siri said it time for 10 minutes
02:00 - give the time okay seriously think a lot
02:02 - come on
02:03 - any day now all right 10 minute timer on
02:06 - the clock
02:07 - boom let's go we're in okay
02:10 - this is going to be wild i'm excited
02:12 - okay i'm oscar wilde here
02:14 - all right so holy crap only thing i know
02:18 - here right now is
02:19 - my background color needs to be freaking
02:22 - my background color needs to be whatever
02:24 - that freaking color is okay it's right
02:26 - there that's the color so i copied it
02:28 - okay let's zoom in a lot more so you
02:30 - guys can view it a little bit easier all
02:32 - right there we go
02:33 - so style we're styling a div here
02:36 - okay it's this div right here can right
02:38 - inside of it
02:40 - okay great uh okay so
02:43 - can we grab the body actually and can i
02:45 - change its color
02:47 - this can i go background background
02:50 - give it that color nice okay
02:54 - it's crazy my css skills are so bad i'm
02:56 - even surprised and blown away by this
02:58 - i'm absolutely baffled i'm like
03:00 - wow holy did not know that was
03:02 - possible okay so
03:04 - um let's keep going well looks like we
03:06 - have one div
03:07 - with a width and so forth and then we
03:09 - have um
03:10 - basically a circle so the first thing i
03:12 - want to figure out is well how do we
03:14 - make a circle that's the first thing i
03:15 - think i want to figure out so
03:17 - let's do circle with css
03:20 - right here i'm not really sure sometimes
03:22 - how to do all these shapes of css so
03:25 - but right here rectangle
03:28 - circle shape okay so width height
03:30 - background right border waves okay now
03:32 - actually no i don't know with that
03:33 - so let's do um border border
03:37 - radius radius of 50 percent right here
03:41 - all right so we got ourselves a circle
03:42 - let's make sure the background color of
03:43 - the whole
03:44 - uh body how to do the do i just do body
03:48 - body right here background
03:51 - of that is gonna be this right here so
03:54 - i'm gonna do
03:55 - here copy that top of that right here
03:58 - boom
03:59 - beautiful awesome next so what i'm
04:02 - thinking the way i want to do it is kind
04:03 - of like
04:04 - huh how do you the way it sees like
04:07 - almost like four circles
04:08 - on top of each other with a box
04:12 - hmm ah that might be interesting so that
04:15 - might be interesting so
04:16 - or maybe it's four squares maybe it's
04:18 - like four squares okay
04:20 - okay actually i think i think i got it
04:21 - because here things right it's like four
04:23 - squares
04:24 - with a circle a transparent circle got
04:27 - it all right i got it
04:28 - all right so hopefully i'm not i'm
04:30 - curious how kazzy thinks about it
04:32 - so let's go ahead we'll create another
04:34 - div here we actually will create
04:37 - four divs four divs so let's do one
04:41 - no four more dips so div div bum pum
04:44 - right here i'm gonna give it a um
04:47 - id equals equals
04:51 - let's see one um
04:54 - one dash block okay i'll do the same
04:57 - thing for
04:58 - oh bomb all right bun all right two dash
05:01 - block
05:02 - three dash block three and then four
05:04 - dash block
05:05 - okay so the way i see it here
05:08 - okay so we got we got that that's good
05:10 - now what is happening here these are
05:12 - um let me just start off with four box
05:15 - squares
05:16 - okay or three box squares that do that
05:18 - let me try to
05:19 - let me see if i can even do that okay so
05:21 - let's grab this color here and let's
05:23 - give our square that color
05:26 - this okay now um can i do margin can we
05:29 - do margin
05:31 - left uh 3 em oh nice that works
05:34 - four five i can't believe i'm able to do
05:37 - this that's great
05:38 - okay now let's give a margin top
05:41 - of two yeah three
05:47 - why am i doing this this is a terrible
05:50 - idea
05:53 - okay gotta act professional all right so
05:56 - we got the square oh squirt kind of like
05:59 - lines up perfectly holy
06:02 - i just got i guess i must have pixel
06:04 - perfect eyes
06:05 - all right so let's make two more divs
06:08 - which will give us two more squares
06:10 - that's a bad idea isn't it can i give a
06:13 - class name of um what's a good way of
06:16 - doing this i'm gonna give this
06:17 - a class of yellow okay let's just call
06:21 - that
06:21 - yellow and let's go div and i'll go
06:25 - yellow i can do this right okay so i'm
06:27 - grabbing the yellow class inside of the
06:30 - div can i um let me remove this div here
06:34 - for now let's just drop that in right
06:36 - there oh
06:37 - i mean to do that okay let's see if i
06:40 - can give it
06:41 - this yellowish color so let's go right
06:43 - there oh
06:44 - that did not do okay
06:47 - cool um yeah i just had to grab that
06:49 - class the yellow class
06:50 - okay so now i got my yellow square we're
06:54 - gonna probably position it a line
06:55 - somehow so
06:59 - okay so i'm gonna give it also a class
07:01 - of block i'm doing that so that i can go
07:03 - ahead and actually target
07:04 - all them together but also have the
07:05 - author to target them individually for
07:06 - color purposes all right that's so good
07:08 - maybe i can zoom in a little bit people
07:09 - you guys can see that better boom all
07:11 - right that's
07:12 - awesome so now that way i see i'm for
07:14 - the body
07:15 - i'm actually going to i think this div
07:17 - right here is actually going to be
07:18 - the main diff this would be the circle
07:20 - class class is equal to circle
07:23 - i'm going to give this one so div dot
07:26 - circle that's the one the other divs i'm
07:28 - going to go ahead and say
07:30 - display flex and then flex
07:34 - wrap and then let's go ahead and do the
07:36 - block so what i'm going to do here is
07:38 - you'll start to see basically me create
07:41 - four squares
07:43 - to create those screens i'm just i'm
07:45 - going to give it a class let me see the
07:46 - block
07:47 - and i'm going to say width is 70 with it
07:51 - width is 50 boom
07:54 - we are going to it's a whole thing
07:58 - um let's go position absolute
08:01 - and maybe this one as well position
08:04 - absolute
08:05 - okay great uh and now we're gonna go
08:09 - 9 am to the left 10 15 12
08:12 - 13 12 12.5 12.4 12.3
08:17 - 12.2 perfect okay so now we got
08:21 - two squares all right so
08:24 - far i'm not doing so bad
08:28 - i'm gonna have a really crappy solution
08:30 - to this
08:31 - but hey so far i'm making progress i'm
08:33 - actually really really surprised i was
08:35 - able to do this like i'm not gonna
08:36 -  lie that's
08:37 - it's already got kind of mind blown
08:39 - right now what is what is that what is
08:41 - this
08:42 - crappy color even called oh we only
08:44 - got a couple of minutes
08:46 - right i'm gonna give for example then
08:48 - i'm gonna give
08:49 - let's see so div uh let's just see let's
08:53 - give
08:54 - each one a color so the one block this
08:57 - is gonna be
08:57 - one dash block tata that one's gonna
09:01 - have a color of this
09:02 - background boom that's gonna be that
09:05 - right there that's
09:06 - the first div the second block is going
09:09 - to be
09:10 - second tube dash block pom pom that's
09:13 - gonna be
09:14 - the orange right here what
09:17 - only a couple of minutes left five
09:19 - minutes okay
09:20 - i know five minutes left okay background
09:23 - even if we go over time continue on
09:26 - all right so um you know you know what
09:29 - let's just destroy him i don't know
09:30 - where he's at
09:31 - but we're gonna freaking crush him you
09:33 - guys i'm excited
09:35 - all right so um what is that color i
09:39 - don't know what that color is called
09:40 - it's like a shitty yellow like what is
09:42 - this um
09:43 - i'm gonna call it poop hopefully i can
09:46 - call a class that
09:47 - gonna grab poop dot poop and then go
09:50 - like this
09:52 - and uh give it the styling
09:55 - oh i actually can
10:00 - i did not know you could do that oh my
10:03 - god
10:04 - i'm having so much fun coding it should
10:05 - be illegal background
10:08 - let's just see a second buzz would be
10:10 - this orange one
10:11 - boom okay third block let's see three
10:14 - three dash block okay through that's
10:17 - block
10:18 - okay three dash block is gonna be that
10:20 - right there
10:22 - uh that one okay so background
10:27 - yes i am recording so that's background
10:29 - that
10:30 - and then the fourth dash block dash four
10:33 - dash block um is going to be
10:37 - this right here right so background
10:40 - again i'm trying to do is four squares
10:42 - because i said the way i see it is four
10:44 - squares with the transparent circle in
10:45 - the middle that's what i'm saying right
10:46 - i think that's how i want to think about
10:48 - it right here and then for every single
10:50 - block on your width and then the height
10:52 - is going to be 50vh okay
10:55 - for some reason i don't see any of those
10:57 - i'm sure why why it doesn't have those
10:59 - specific blocks
11:00 - oh because there's margin oh my god
11:03 - really
11:04 - so body i'm gonna give margin of zero
11:07 - that's part one and then let's go and
11:10 - remove this circle for now
11:11 - okay and this background color let's
11:14 - remove that for now too
11:15 - right uh i don't understand why the
11:19 - blocks are not showing up so i'm giving
11:20 - it a 53 and then 50 vertical height
11:23 - i think it's height is 50 as well let's
11:25 - do a height of like
11:26 - see c30 pixels let's see what happens
11:28 - now anything
11:30 - come on there it is what about the
11:32 - background color background
11:34 - is it because i cannot use dashes in the
11:36 - id not now use dashes
11:38 - i think i can oh forgot this
11:42 - okay so margin i'm actually going to
11:44 - give it the same margin as
11:46 - my cyan green one
11:49 - okay so same margin so it should overlap
11:51 - on that
11:52 - but now margin top is going to be more
11:55 - on this one let's give it like a eight
11:57 - and like that shitty yellow let's give
12:00 - it that
12:00 - let's go ten nine ten
12:05 - nine point five nine point four nine
12:07 - point three nine point two nine point
12:08 - three nine
12:09 - two perfect okay i work with position
12:12 - absolutes
12:13 - i'm a real developer uh 9.02
12:18 - 9.01 9.2 that's fine
12:21 - okay so i have squares now what i want
12:25 - to do is i'm going to like put
12:27 - the the background colored rect like
12:29 - squares on top of these like
12:31 - right here right here and right there
12:35 - i mean that's already right there so
12:37 - that's good
12:38 - but um yeah how am i gonna do how how do
12:41 - i make it a
12:42 - circle like i actually don't know how to
12:44 - make it a freaking circle
12:46 - i was talking about making the triangle
12:47 - but i don't know how to make a freaking
12:49 - triangle so
12:50 - holy crap i got one minute left
12:53 - um okay so this is the shape that we're
12:57 - going after
12:58 - i don't know how to do that i don't know
13:00 - how to do that
13:01 - okay the little like curve i can put
13:04 - like a
13:06 - square over this and that could give it
13:07 - like a circle type of shape so let's
13:09 - actually try that
13:11 - so i'm going to take this paste i'll
13:14 - call it red
13:15 - and i'll make another one oops let's
13:18 - copy this
13:19 - yellow one let's go like this let's call
13:22 - it red
13:23 - let's give it that color boom right
13:25 - there
13:26 - margin left 15 19
13:31 - um i think i got to give it more margin
13:34 - top
13:35 - i don't know what's happening anymore
13:37 - let's give it a different color
13:39 - so i can like see it um let's just give
13:42 - it this like greenish color
13:44 - oh that's where it's at um
13:48 - just makes it on top of it so i don't

16:08 - able to make those squares i've never
16:10 - done i'd do so little with css it's kind
16:12 - of crazy
16:13 - i am mostly developing back end stuff
16:16 - sometimes fun and stuff but most of the
16:18 - times i stay away from
16:19 - front end but it was fun i hope you had
16:22 - a lot of fun
16:23 - and now i'm just for fun gonna go ahead
16:26 - and just
16:27 - keep going and see how far i get and
16:29 - let's see if i actually
16:30 - do the whole thing so let's just go all
16:33 - right so here's what i got to so far a
16:34 - white page
16:37 - oh my god oh my god
16:40 - okay let's go ahead and target our how
16:42 - to target one block right here so let's
16:44 - see
16:45 - all right well i mean i've got i can do
16:46 - a few ways maybe i'll just do a set of
16:49 - ids i'm going to
16:49 - block one like this that one block two
16:52 - blocks let's continue on so we're going
16:54 - to continue on okay
16:55 - here one dash block how about now oh i
16:57 - think it's actually because of this
16:58 - whole thing
16:59 - what did i completely forget how to do
17:02 - things
17:02 - in in css how about this like really
17:06 - what the heck how the heck do i not what
17:09 - what do i do here
17:10 - why isn't the background color not
17:12 - showing up background
17:14 - color give me something look it's not
17:18 - giving me a background color
17:20 - that makes no sense
17:21 - i'm sorry for cussing okay come on hold
17:25 - on
17:25 - okay okay so why would that would not
17:27 - give me a background color
17:29 - i can get i can get the child or
17:30 - something i'm just kidding like how do i
17:32 - get how do you do like the nth child
17:33 - you can do a front child so hard i think
17:37 - it's first dash child yeah it's just the
17:40 - one
17:41 - colon back on red oh that was there oh
17:44 - oh okay so i can do that okay
17:48 - okay so i'm thinking i can
17:51 - i can have is that a border radius is
17:54 - that what that
17:55 - is is that what i can add let's go here
17:58 - let's go
17:58 - border radius em and let's go
18:02 - 4 am so that's not what i want i don't
18:05 - want it curving from
18:06 - that side so let's keep this at zero
18:09 - let's go here i also don't want it
18:12 - curving from that side let's go
18:14 - there let's make that bigger oh
18:18 - it is border radius guys it's
18:21 - i don't figure it out i figured it out
18:26 - yo i think i got this i think i got this
18:29 - wait i actually started off
18:31 - around and joking and now i actually
18:33 - think i might destroy him
18:35 - um let's give a border radius
18:38 - to this div as well but uh for this
18:41 - we're not gonna give it
18:43 - on the right hand side we're gonna give
18:45 - it on the left hand side so let's try it
18:47 - oh it worked it freaking worked
18:50 - beautiful beautiful uh why is the poop
18:53 - one changing
18:55 - interesting i changed the top div
18:57 - alright you know what let's just give it
18:58 - a class name
19:00 - let's give this a class of green
19:03 - and let's just call this dot green like
19:06 - that
19:07 - and let's go six beautiful
19:10 - okay and now let's make the bottom one
19:15 - let's uh add border radius to that
19:18 - let's go here and go i don't understand
19:22 - why that was the case but apparently
19:23 - that's
19:24 - that's the case okay so that okay so
19:26 - that's better so that
19:27 - that makes me happy so apparently i
19:28 - can't target directly
19:30 - which is dumb that makes no sense
19:32 - whatsoever like why
19:33 - like why what does it make me faster
19:35 - like literally makes me nothing faster
19:37 - it just decreases it might make me fresh
19:39 - give me more frustration which i don't
19:40 - like
19:40 - um because i can do that by adding child
19:42 - so i could do block
19:44 - um and dash child and we'll do the
19:48 - second one
19:49 - the number two and then so then now we
19:52 - can do
19:52 - okay so nth child right here and let's
19:55 - do a background color of a different
19:57 - which could be the orange one
19:58 - that's gonna be now yeah good okay
20:01 - next okay all right come on really you
20:05 - can like really see us as battle you're
20:07 - gonna do this to me
20:09 - like what the heck block and shovels do
20:11 - three
20:12 - okay that one's gonna be this one i
20:15 - realized that
20:16 - my strategy might not actually be the
20:17 - best strategy honestly because
20:19 - there are so many layers to this it's
20:21 - that it's crazy
20:22 - like i realized that might not be the
20:23 - strategy as like as as i'm more looking
20:25 - into this it might not be the best
20:27 - strategy
20:28 - like this hey this is literally
20:31 - perfect
20:31 - i'm just gonna hit submit let's see what
20:33 - we get let's
20:35 -  go you guys
20:39 - 97 match and in all fairness it's only 4
20:43 - 42 p.m
20:44 - so this is 15 minutes in 15 minutes in
20:48 - your boy did this your boy is so excited
20:51 - guys give it up smash the thumbs up
20:54 - button subscribe to the freaking channel
20:56 - okay because i put it out on the line
20:58 - for you this was some like
21:00 - jake paul versus ben askren he was
21:02 - ben askren
21:03 - i was jake paul this was some floyd
21:07 - mayweather versus
21:08 - logan paul actually that fight's
21:09 - gonna happen on june 6th and i don't
21:11 - know how that's gonna go down
21:12 - so weird reference okay i can't
21:15 - believe i came in with the attitude to
21:16 - crush
21:17 - and i did and i think i mean i don't
21:19 - know oh
21:20 - the only thing that's not pixel perfect
21:23 - is because i was using ems
21:24 - and i think i should have just used
21:26 - pixels because it's not pixel perfect
21:28 - right so that is just like a little off
21:31 - compared to this
21:32 - so that's where i'm probably not on a
21:34 - 100 match but
21:35 - in my eyes guys this is as good as it
21:38 - gets this is my
21:39 - high score i'm at a 97 match let's look
21:42 - at leaderboards let's look at all
21:44 - players
21:45 - i don't know exactly how to read this
21:48 - leaderboard
21:48 - or where i'm at but i'm freaking happy
21:52 - and that's it okay okay this is
21:55 - interesting
21:56 - this is interesting okay so maybe let's
21:58 - do 100
21:59 - i think it's um what was it before 120
22:02 - uh was it 50 60 50 was it like i forgot
22:06 - what number it was it was like 100
22:08 - pixels
22:08 - okay so i like that let's go ahead and
22:10 - make another
22:12 - what yeah what's up
22:18 - continue or not no let's continue bro
22:26 - let's continue that's fun
22:30 - yeah let's continue i'm still recording
22:32 - wow guys i'm just gonna have to say i
22:34 - think nas won this one but you know
22:36 - i did what i could with what little i
22:38 - know it's actually really
22:40 - hard but i think we can do it yeah yeah
22:43 - i think we can
22:44 - yeah yeah
22:50 - yeah i really want to know yeah i really
22:52 - want to know how this works i think i'll
22:54 - get it
22:55 - yeah because i think the way we can do
22:56 - it is if i create like a square
22:59 - if i create okay i got if i could create
23:00 - a square right and i can put those
23:03 - inside there i create a square so here
23:05 - let's do this so we'll do div
23:08 - right i'm gonna create a yes and i'm
23:10 - gonna align down the center okay perfect
23:12 - yes
23:12 - i'm gonna line down the center that's
23:14 - just gonna it's gonna be interesting
23:16 - so this block number two let's just say
23:18 - the second child right
23:20 - and this one is also with 100 pixels by
23:22 - 100 pixels
23:24 - this div right here this
23:27 - span okay that way i just i'm
23:29 - surrounding myself around that so we'll
23:31 - do
23:32 - span i'm gonna do display block now
23:34 - check this out
23:35 - i'm gonna do width it's gonna be
23:38 - um what's this width is gonna be
23:41 - uh let's just say 100 pixels and i'll
23:44 - just say 200 pixels
23:45 - and a height off of 200 pixels i
23:49 - literally have like
23:50 - like 10 minutes i think i got this i can
23:52 - do in 10 minutes honestly i think i got
23:53 - this
23:54 - so and then we'll do a background color
23:57 - please tell them i can do this too as
23:59 - well by the way background
24:01 - orange i would say maybe it's more on
24:03 - the side of like 100 pixels
24:05 - 200 pixels all right so now i'm going to
24:08 - center this by just doing display flex
24:10 - on the body so display
24:11 - flex on the body and then
24:14 - justify content oh align
24:18 - items center okay that is that is good
24:21 - so you see that that means the height is
24:23 - okay so that's good
24:24 - so i've got that thing let's do the
24:26 - whole background is
24:27 - this one let's just do actually i think
24:30 - it's gonna be a third block that needs
24:31 - needs this this type of stuff so let's
24:33 - do the first child
24:35 - you see that right there so that's gonna
24:37 - be perfect so that's the third
24:39 - the first out okay great i feel i'm so
24:42 - close
24:43 - it's okay oh let's go
24:48 - oh come on you really is that what
24:50 - you're gonna do for me is that what
24:51 - you're gonna do for me really
24:53 - top right bottoms that's the bottom ones
24:55 - everything else is zero
24:56 - to get this one 100 okay so that's not
24:59 - that one that's not the one i want i
25:01 - want
25:01 - a different one which i want is this one
25:05 - which is going to be
25:06 - which the naming is wrong just that one
25:08 - so it's the first
25:09 - number i don't really i still i'll
25:12 - figure out what those numbers mean in a
25:14 - second because i think it's like
25:15 - so the second one is gonna be that one
25:18 - so we'll do it like this so that's gonna
25:22 - be that
25:23 - the top right which looks like this one
25:25 - this green one
25:27 - which is this one perfect again we're
25:30 - not
25:30 - copying we're just learning okay
25:33 - all right so that's gonna be the second
25:35 - one which is gonna be this right here
25:37 - again i'm also gonna do it with 100
25:38 - pixels with height as well
25:40 - that's gonna be a big deal nice okay
25:44 - that's getting somewhere for sure okay
25:46 - and then of course give me the last was
25:47 - also gonna be with
25:48 - and then i have a few ways in which i
25:50 - can align them that's not an issue
25:51 - whatsoever
25:53 - i can use the split slate likes to align
25:54 - them as well i think i got this at this
25:55 - point
25:56 - um that's not an issue so now i think i
25:59 - got it at this point
26:00 - all right let's go ahead and remove this
26:01 - i don't think this is needed at this
26:02 - point this will not
26:03 - ruin my day but it did so close okay
26:07 - so look we're starting to get it look at
26:09 - that bro
26:11 - easy peasy lemon squeezy all right let's
26:14 - do this span
26:15 - inline block i'm curious if it will
26:17 - actually
26:18 - go in the position that i want it to go
26:20 - because if it's 100 pixels i guess no it
26:22 - does not so
26:23 - um can we do display flex on it but
26:26 - we do flex wrap oh
26:30 - whoa no
26:33 - way check this out oh
26:36 - we got it let's go
26:42 - we got it it's beautiful
26:45 - so thanks for watching the css battle
26:47 - hope you had fun
26:48 - we're definitely gonna try to do more of
26:50 - these you know we enjoyed it and that's
26:52 - it
26:53 - we'll see you in the next video
27:07 - [Music]
27:21 - you

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys today we are going to be doing a css battle we got inspired by web dev simplify and we thought hey we should be doing this too now i'm going to be battling nas who's one of the instructors here at clever programmer alright so now we are going to battle kazi the man himself the python king the python papa as we like to say we're going to see just how good his css skills against the javascript python that could be an interesting situation that we're going to test out today with this css battle right here and my goal is to absolutely smash his face in and just destroy him and wreck him like literally it's gonna be crazy okay you're gonna watch this happen i was the king of python and now i'm about to become the king of css so if you're ready to watch some ass whooping let's get straight into it i'm very curious i've done css for quite a while now right and i have some good knowledge of that but the issue with me personally is the fact that well you know i don't know any of those like really fancy css i know how to build websites with css but when it comes to crazy css i'm not good at that all right just a little tiny disclaimer i absolutely um suck at css i'm hoping that nas doesn't hear this but um i have zero yeah i'm ready of course i'm ready dude what the is he talking about of course i'm ready you're ready bro all righty let's go okay let's go alright guys so here's what's gonna happen now we're gonna put a 10minute timer and how are we need to make this this is our target okay so however close we get to it that's it whoever gets closer in 10 minutes wins so at 4 37 p.m we're gonna put a stop and see how close we got hopefully we'll be able to get it hopefully i'll be able to get it and hopefully cause it doesn't you know with that said let's just jump straight into it hey siri set a timer for 10 minutes hey siri said it time for 10 minutes give the time okay seriously think a lot come on any day now all right 10 minute timer on the clock boom let's go we're in okay this is going to be wild i'm excited okay i'm oscar wilde here all right so holy crap only thing i know here right now is my background color needs to be freaking my background color needs to be whatever that freaking color is okay it's right there that's the color so i copied it okay let's zoom in a lot more so you guys can view it a little bit easier all right there we go so style we're styling a div here okay it's this div right here can right inside of it okay great uh okay so can we grab the body actually and can i change its color this can i go background background give it that color nice okay it's crazy my css skills are so bad i'm even surprised and blown away by this i'm absolutely baffled i'm like wow holy did not know that was possible okay so um let's keep going well looks like we have one div with a width and so forth and then we have um basically a circle so the first thing i want to figure out is well how do we make a circle that's the first thing i think i want to figure out so let's do circle with css right here i'm not really sure sometimes how to do all these shapes of css so but right here rectangle circle shape okay so width height background right border waves okay now actually no i don't know with that so let's do um border border radius radius of 50 percent right here all right so we got ourselves a circle let's make sure the background color of the whole uh body how to do the do i just do body body right here background of that is gonna be this right here so i'm gonna do here copy that top of that right here boom beautiful awesome next so what i'm thinking the way i want to do it is kind of like huh how do you the way it sees like almost like four circles on top of each other with a box hmm ah that might be interesting so that might be interesting so or maybe it's four squares maybe it's like four squares okay okay actually i think i think i got it because here things right it's like four squares with a circle a transparent circle got it all right i got it all right so hopefully i'm not i'm curious how kazzy thinks about it so let's go ahead we'll create another div here we actually will create four divs four divs so let's do one no four more dips so div div bum pum right here i'm gonna give it a um id equals equals let's see one um one dash block okay i'll do the same thing for oh bomb all right bun all right two dash block three dash block three and then four dash block okay so the way i see it here okay so we got we got that that's good now what is happening here these are um let me just start off with four box squares okay or three box squares that do that let me try to let me see if i can even do that okay so let's grab this color here and let's give our square that color this okay now um can i do margin can we do margin left uh 3 em oh nice that works four five i can't believe i'm able to do this that's great okay now let's give a margin top of two yeah three why am i doing this this is a terrible idea okay gotta act professional all right so we got the square oh squirt kind of like lines up perfectly holy i just got i guess i must have pixel perfect eyes all right so let's make two more divs which will give us two more squares that's a bad idea isn't it can i give a class name of um what's a good way of doing this i'm gonna give this a class of yellow okay let's just call that yellow and let's go div and i'll go yellow i can do this right okay so i'm grabbing the yellow class inside of the div can i um let me remove this div here for now let's just drop that in right there oh i mean to do that okay let's see if i can give it this yellowish color so let's go right there oh that did not do okay cool um yeah i just had to grab that class the yellow class okay so now i got my yellow square we're gonna probably position it a line somehow so okay so i'm gonna give it also a class of block i'm doing that so that i can go ahead and actually target all them together but also have the author to target them individually for color purposes all right that's so good maybe i can zoom in a little bit people you guys can see that better boom all right that's awesome so now that way i see i'm for the body i'm actually going to i think this div right here is actually going to be the main diff this would be the circle class class is equal to circle i'm going to give this one so div dot circle that's the one the other divs i'm going to go ahead and say display flex and then flex wrap and then let's go ahead and do the block so what i'm going to do here is you'll start to see basically me create four squares to create those screens i'm just i'm going to give it a class let me see the block and i'm going to say width is 70 with it width is 50 boom we are going to it's a whole thing um let's go position absolute and maybe this one as well position absolute okay great uh and now we're gonna go 9 am to the left 10 15 12 13 12 12.5 12.4 12.3 12.2 perfect okay so now we got two squares all right so far i'm not doing so bad i'm gonna have a really crappy solution to this but hey so far i'm making progress i'm actually really really surprised i was able to do this like i'm not gonna lie that's it's already got kind of mind blown right now what is what is that what is this crappy color even called oh we only got a couple of minutes right i'm gonna give for example then i'm gonna give let's see so div uh let's just see let's give each one a color so the one block this is gonna be one dash block tata that one's gonna have a color of this background boom that's gonna be that right there that's the first div the second block is going to be second tube dash block pom pom that's gonna be the orange right here what only a couple of minutes left five minutes okay i know five minutes left okay background even if we go over time continue on all right so um you know you know what let's just destroy him i don't know where he's at but we're gonna freaking crush him you guys i'm excited all right so um what is that color i don't know what that color is called it's like a shitty yellow like what is this um i'm gonna call it poop hopefully i can call a class that gonna grab poop dot poop and then go like this and uh give it the styling oh i actually can i did not know you could do that oh my god i'm having so much fun coding it should be illegal background let's just see a second buzz would be this orange one boom okay third block let's see three three dash block okay through that's block okay three dash block is gonna be that right there uh that one okay so background yes i am recording so that's background that and then the fourth dash block dash four dash block um is going to be this right here right so background again i'm trying to do is four squares because i said the way i see it is four squares with the transparent circle in the middle that's what i'm saying right i think that's how i want to think about it right here and then for every single block on your width and then the height is going to be 50vh okay for some reason i don't see any of those i'm sure why why it doesn't have those specific blocks oh because there's margin oh my god really so body i'm gonna give margin of zero that's part one and then let's go and remove this circle for now okay and this background color let's remove that for now too right uh i don't understand why the blocks are not showing up so i'm giving it a 53 and then 50 vertical height i think it's height is 50 as well let's do a height of like see c30 pixels let's see what happens now anything come on there it is what about the background color background is it because i cannot use dashes in the id not now use dashes i think i can oh forgot this okay so margin i'm actually going to give it the same margin as my cyan green one okay so same margin so it should overlap on that but now margin top is going to be more on this one let's give it like a eight and like that shitty yellow let's give it that let's go ten nine ten nine point five nine point four nine point three nine point two nine point three nine two perfect okay i work with position absolutes i'm a real developer uh 9.02 9.01 9.2 that's fine okay so i have squares now what i want to do is i'm going to like put the the background colored rect like squares on top of these like right here right here and right there i mean that's already right there so that's good but um yeah how am i gonna do how how do i make it a circle like i actually don't know how to make it a freaking circle i was talking about making the triangle but i don't know how to make a freaking triangle so holy crap i got one minute left um okay so this is the shape that we're going after i don't know how to do that i don't know how to do that okay the little like curve i can put like a square over this and that could give it like a circle type of shape so let's actually try that so i'm going to take this paste i'll call it red and i'll make another one oops let's copy this yellow one let's go like this let's call it red let's give it that color boom right there margin left 15 19 um i think i got to give it more margin top i don't know what's happening anymore let's give it a different color so i can like see it um let's just give it this like greenish color oh that's where it's at um just makes it on top of it so i don't really think that's really what i want um background dash color come on give me something give me like any beckham color anything whatsoever come on anything come on come on why is there no what does this say let me see what's it telling me right there height okay oh it's not given an id i cannot use ids can i not use ids here oh border radius right i can have border radius like this oh um but how do i add four radius it's like only on one side so let's try uh oh interesting okay okay ah okay so what happens when i make this zero damn it ah geez all right so maybe i can't let's see we'll all got that in 10 minutes a lot till let's continue till we get it all right guys so this is where i got to in this challenge okay this is where i'm at this is where i'm at 10 minutes in i'm just gonna hit submit uh let's see what i get submit boom you scored 46 468 something i had a 93.5 match you guys your boy is officially a css god aka css daddy aka css granddaddy guys give it up for your boy the css master the css aficionado you saw my skills in action you are welcome for letting you see my skills in action so with that said i mean i have zero doubt that we absolutely crushed our competition i got that in 10 minutes a lot i think we dominated the competition i mean how is he gonna get better than a 93 match in 10 minutes he's not right that's not gonna happen i'm very proud oh you guys can actually see this 93 match right there okay i'm very proud of what we got accomplished together i'm really i'm genuinely surprised i was able to make those squares i've never done i'd do so little with css it's kind of crazy i am mostly developing back end stuff sometimes fun and stuff but most of the times i stay away from front end but it was fun i hope you had a lot of fun and now i'm just for fun gonna go ahead and just keep going and see how far i get and let's see if i actually do the whole thing so let's just go all right so here's what i got to so far a white page oh my god oh my god okay let's go ahead and target our how to target one block right here so let's see all right well i mean i've got i can do a few ways maybe i'll just do a set of ids i'm going to block one like this that one block two blocks let's continue on so we're going to continue on okay here one dash block how about now oh i think it's actually because of this whole thing what did i completely forget how to do things in in css how about this like really what the heck how the heck do i not what what do i do here why isn't the background color not showing up background color give me something look it's not giving me a background color that makes no sense i'm sorry for cussing okay come on hold on okay okay so why would that would not give me a background color i can get i can get the child or something i'm just kidding like how do i get how do you do like the nth child you can do a front child so hard i think it's first dash child yeah it's just the one colon back on red oh that was there oh oh okay so i can do that okay okay so i'm thinking i can i can have is that a border radius is that what that is is that what i can add let's go here let's go border radius em and let's go 4 am so that's not what i want i don't want it curving from that side so let's keep this at zero let's go here i also don't want it curving from that side let's go there let's make that bigger oh it is border radius guys it's i don't figure it out i figured it out yo i think i got this i think i got this wait i actually started off around and joking and now i actually think i might destroy him um let's give a border radius to this div as well but uh for this we're not gonna give it on the right hand side we're gonna give it on the left hand side so let's try it oh it worked it freaking worked beautiful beautiful uh why is the poop one changing interesting i changed the top div alright you know what let's just give it a class name let's give this a class of green and let's just call this dot green like that and let's go six beautiful okay and now let's make the bottom one let's uh add border radius to that let's go here and go i don't understand why that was the case but apparently that's that's the case okay so that okay so that's better so that that makes me happy so apparently i can't target directly which is dumb that makes no sense whatsoever like why like why what does it make me faster like literally makes me nothing faster it just decreases it might make me fresh give me more frustration which i don't like um because i can do that by adding child so i could do block um and dash child and we'll do the second one the number two and then so then now we can do okay so nth child right here and let's do a background color of a different which could be the orange one that's gonna be now yeah good okay next okay all right come on really you can like really see us as battle you're gonna do this to me like what the heck block and shovels do three okay that one's gonna be this one i realized that my strategy might not actually be the best strategy honestly because there are so many layers to this it's that it's crazy like i realized that might not be the strategy as like as as i'm more looking into this it might not be the best strategy like this hey this is literally perfect i'm just gonna hit submit let's see what we get let's go you guys 97 match and in all fairness it's only 4 42 p.m so this is 15 minutes in 15 minutes in your boy did this your boy is so excited guys give it up smash the thumbs up button subscribe to the freaking channel okay because i put it out on the line for you this was some like jake paul versus ben askren he was ben askren i was jake paul this was some floyd mayweather versus logan paul actually that fight's gonna happen on june 6th and i don't know how that's gonna go down so weird reference okay i can't believe i came in with the attitude to crush and i did and i think i mean i don't know oh the only thing that's not pixel perfect is because i was using ems and i think i should have just used pixels because it's not pixel perfect right so that is just like a little off compared to this so that's where i'm probably not on a 100 match but in my eyes guys this is as good as it gets this is my high score i'm at a 97 match let's look at leaderboards let's look at all players i don't know exactly how to read this leaderboard or where i'm at but i'm freaking happy and that's it okay okay this is interesting this is interesting okay so maybe let's do 100 i think it's um what was it before 120 uh was it 50 60 50 was it like i forgot what number it was it was like 100 pixels okay so i like that let's go ahead and make another what yeah what's up continue or not no let's continue bro let's continue that's fun yeah let's continue i'm still recording wow guys i'm just gonna have to say i think nas won this one but you know i did what i could with what little i know it's actually really hard but i think we can do it yeah yeah i think we can yeah yeah yeah i really want to know yeah i really want to know how this works i think i'll get it yeah because i think the way we can do it is if i create like a square if i create okay i got if i could create a square right and i can put those inside there i create a square so here let's do this so we'll do div right i'm gonna create a yes and i'm gonna align down the center okay perfect yes i'm gonna line down the center that's just gonna it's gonna be interesting so this block number two let's just say the second child right and this one is also with 100 pixels by 100 pixels this div right here this span okay that way i just i'm surrounding myself around that so we'll do span i'm gonna do display block now check this out i'm gonna do width it's gonna be um what's this width is gonna be uh let's just say 100 pixels and i'll just say 200 pixels and a height off of 200 pixels i literally have like like 10 minutes i think i got this i can do in 10 minutes honestly i think i got this so and then we'll do a background color please tell them i can do this too as well by the way background orange i would say maybe it's more on the side of like 100 pixels 200 pixels all right so now i'm going to center this by just doing display flex on the body so display flex on the body and then justify content oh align items center okay that is that is good so you see that that means the height is okay so that's good so i've got that thing let's do the whole background is this one let's just do actually i think it's gonna be a third block that needs needs this this type of stuff so let's do the first child you see that right there so that's gonna be perfect so that's the third the first out okay great i feel i'm so close it's okay oh let's go oh come on you really is that what you're gonna do for me is that what you're gonna do for me really top right bottoms that's the bottom ones everything else is zero to get this one 100 okay so that's not that one that's not the one i want i want a different one which i want is this one which is going to be which the naming is wrong just that one so it's the first number i don't really i still i'll figure out what those numbers mean in a second because i think it's like so the second one is gonna be that one so we'll do it like this so that's gonna be that the top right which looks like this one this green one which is this one perfect again we're not copying we're just learning okay all right so that's gonna be the second one which is gonna be this right here again i'm also gonna do it with 100 pixels with height as well that's gonna be a big deal nice okay that's getting somewhere for sure okay and then of course give me the last was also gonna be with and then i have a few ways in which i can align them that's not an issue whatsoever i can use the split slate likes to align them as well i think i got this at this point um that's not an issue so now i think i got it at this point all right let's go ahead and remove this i don't think this is needed at this point this will not ruin my day but it did so close okay so look we're starting to get it look at that bro easy peasy lemon squeezy all right let's do this span inline block i'm curious if it will actually go in the position that i want it to go because if it's 100 pixels i guess no it does not so um can we do display flex on it but we do flex wrap oh whoa no way check this out oh we got it let's go we got it it's beautiful so thanks for watching the css battle hope you had fun we're definitely gonna try to do more of these you know we enjoyed it and that's it we'll see you in the next video you
