00:00 - yo what is up guys how's it going
00:02 - frankie here from cleverprogrammer
00:04 - so we were actually in the middle of the
00:07 - livestream when it just kind of cut down
00:09 - man
00:09 - that's pretty insane what i did want to
00:12 - talk about guys
00:13 - is the fact that you know
00:16 - i think we should still continue
00:18 - everything from where i left off
00:20 - just so you guys can have an idea of
00:21 - what is going on
00:23 - and so give me one second here guys let
00:26 - me
00:26 - actually double check what's going on
00:29 - here
00:29 - so awesome we left off in the actual
00:33 - ssd i was giving a little bit of
00:37 - of that what people were looking at or
00:40 - people were hearing i could hear it
00:41 - myself so
00:42 - now i believe we're good let me see
00:52 - one second
00:58 - so so we're going to talk about
01:02 - what is going on so best
01:05 - ssds versus the actual
01:09 - give me one second
01:12 - beautiful here we go so we got the best
01:15 - ssds right
01:16 - versus the hard drives and i'm just
01:18 - going to continue from where i left off
01:20 - after the end of this we're going to
01:22 - actually put together the whole video
01:24 - and then share with you guys in a simple
01:26 - format where you can just watch
01:28 - the best laptops for programming in 2020
01:30 - i'm glad you guys are back
01:32 - thank you guys for everything and stick
01:34 - to the end
01:35 - the like i said the other live stream
01:37 - crash crashed now we're gonna
01:39 - go ahead and move forward with the whole
01:40 - teaching because you know i don't want
01:42 - to make any excuses for you guys
01:44 - we're gonna move right ahead so off the
01:46 - bat guys
01:47 - i believe that you know going back to
01:49 - this this is an ssd solid state drive
01:52 - hard drive
01:52 - and a hard drive so let's take drive and
01:54 - a hard drive so
01:55 - hard drives have components on them
01:57 - where they actually move they're
01:59 - physically
02:00 - making movement and off the bat they're
02:02 - making the calculations like that and
02:04 - ssds
02:05 - are just solid state drives so they
02:07 - never really move
02:08 - they're they kind of behave like ram ram
02:10 - is i believe it's a
02:12 - sort of solid state drive but it's
02:14 - actually used in memory
02:15 - so that's why it's not that bad and
02:18 - cool so that is one and then going into
02:21 - the
02:22 - actual differences between ssd and hard
02:24 - drive right now
02:25 - so ssd is awesome because it's like more
02:28 - than 10 times
02:29 - faster a lot of times than the actual
02:31 - hard drive this is an example of a
02:32 - laptop file transfer test rate
02:35 - to copy five gigabytes pretty much in
02:37 - megabytes
02:38 - higher is better so this is 237
02:41 - megabytes this would be
02:43 - i don't know how many gigabytes how much
02:44 - how many gigabytes is that
02:47 - none because one gigabyte would be one
02:49 - thousand so
02:50 - awesome so 237 megabytes versus 33
02:54 - megabytes that's
02:55 - almost what is that that's like eight
02:57 - times
02:58 - that's literally like eight times faster
03:00 - ssd is eight times faster
03:02 - so you're gonna want to have a great ace
03:05 - ssd card if you are programming instead
03:08 - of using a hard drive because
03:10 - hard drives right now actually are a
03:12 - little bit outdated i don't think you
03:13 - should even use them at all
03:14 - and the minimum i'd say for a hard drive
03:16 - or an ssd right now to be honest with
03:18 - you guys would be 500 gigabytes
03:20 - unless you're not doing anything
03:21 - important on your computer if you're
03:22 - doing
03:23 - something that's like it doesn't really
03:25 - matter then 256
03:27 - you know gigabytes might be okay for you
03:30 - but at the same time you know you can
03:31 - always get
03:32 - external ssds external hard drives um
03:35 - i believe that you know it's better for
03:37 - you to just get 500 off to start if you
03:39 - can do
03:40 - 1000 ssd 1000 terabyte ssd
03:43 - so going into another thing that's
03:46 - important for you if you are going to
03:48 - start coding is going to be the laptop
03:50 - keyboards
03:51 - so off the batman laptop keyboards are
03:53 - really really important
03:54 - because of the fact that you're going to
03:55 - be typing all day
03:57 - and so we got jim carrey here just you
03:59 - know snapping at the keys just clicking
04:01 - everything
04:03 - and honestly everybody has a different
04:04 - preference on keyboards right now
04:07 - and the thing about it is that you know
04:09 - there's keyboards that have
04:10 - no travel whatsoever to them like the
04:13 - butterfly keyboard
04:14 - on the mac on the macbook um
04:17 - computers or laptops or whatever but
04:19 - they recently changed them i believe in
04:21 - 2020 they believed
04:22 - they changed the butterfly keyboard
04:25 - because it had no travel that was pretty
04:27 - insane i didn't like it i used to have
04:28 - that laptop i didn't like it
04:30 - so this is you know an example of other
04:32 - hard other
04:33 - laptops keyboards and this is what i'm
04:36 - talking about with the
04:37 - butterfly keyboard so butterfly keyboard
04:39 - had no travel the thing about this
04:41 - is that you're typing you want to make
04:42 - sure that you're typing on the actual
04:44 - button
04:45 - and sometimes with some keyboards it
04:47 - feels like you're not typing into
04:48 - anything
04:49 - it's a little bit insane so what are we
04:51 - going to do
04:52 - like if a little bit of debris goes in
04:54 - inside of the keyboard the key
04:56 - then you're gonna have to fix your whole
04:58 - keyboard again and that's pretty crazy
05:00 - so i mean it really doesn't make sense
05:02 - to me to be a programmer somebody that's
05:04 - typing all day and have these type of
05:06 - keyboards although i do love
05:07 - max and i i am very thankful for them
05:10 - that
05:11 - they actually just you know change the
05:13 - way that they
05:14 - they do their keyboards because of this
05:16 - specific thing this is a mechanical
05:17 - keyboard here
05:18 - a lot of people that love gaming
05:21 - specifically
05:21 - love mechanical keyboards i like them
05:23 - but they make so much noise i think it's
05:26 - annoying you know
05:27 - some people i think it's a little bit
05:28 - pretentious too like some people just go
05:30 - like crazy like
05:32 - it's like bro just chill just kind of
05:34 - just type you know beautifully
05:36 - like uh you know like a butterfly sting
05:39 - like a bee muhammad ali
05:40 - but that's kind of what i think about
05:42 - keyboards to be honest with you
05:43 - and mechanical keyboards are king logan
05:45 - says hell yeah man i mean i kind of like
05:47 - them i honestly like them
05:48 - more than how they specifically function
05:52 - they're pretty cool in my opinion but i
05:54 - hate
05:55 - the sounds that come with them i don't
05:57 - like them so
05:59 - one of the important things off the bat
06:01 - that i feel are
06:02 - going to be the most important things
06:04 - whether you use keyboards or not
06:06 - is going to be in the actual programming
06:09 - on your computers is going to be the
06:10 - operating system
06:11 - so off the batman there's three main
06:13 - operating systems
06:14 - right now in the market and it's very
06:18 - important for you to know which one
06:19 - you're going to use so for example like
06:21 - i said in the beginning of my slides
06:23 - i said that you know whether you want to
06:26 - make
06:26 - swift apps or you want to make you know
06:29 - android apps or you want to use unity or
06:31 - you want to use xcode or you want to use
06:34 - you know all of these different types of
06:36 - ids they're going to require for you to
06:37 - have different systems if you want to do
06:40 - apple product you know software then
06:43 - you're going to have to use apple and
06:44 - there's no other way around it
06:46 - i guess you can use you know virtual
06:48 - machines on windows or unix using apple
06:50 - but i wouldn't recommend that just
06:51 - because it's way way slower
06:54 - but you know off the batman the the
06:58 - we are very kind of biased in the fact
07:01 - that i think
07:02 - mac is pretty much might be the best
07:05 - laptop for programming in 2020 not just
07:08 - because of its amazing build
07:10 - and the way that it just moves it's so
07:12 - fast even if you have eight gigabyte ram
07:15 - and if you have 16 gigabytes you're all
07:16 - set but if you have 32 gigabytes of ram
07:18 - on your macbook
07:20 - that's insane bro you're set for a few
07:22 - years for now
07:24 - and what i do want to say is that i mean
07:26 - one of the biggest problems that people
07:28 - have
07:29 - with macbooks is going to be the price
07:31 - so
07:32 - if price is not a concern for you mac is
07:34 - the way to go
07:35 - and i'll go deeper into that in a few of
07:38 - my other slides
07:39 - but i know for a fact that windows gives
07:42 - you more bang for your buck and i grew
07:44 - up using windows i used to fix windows
07:46 - computers
07:46 - i think it's so awesome that they have
07:48 - most of their
07:49 - software is free there's so many options
07:52 - of software you can also do
07:53 - gaming really really comfortably and
07:55 - it's going to be
07:56 - you know really cool for you to to be
07:59 - able to choose whether you want mac
08:01 - or windows all of them are great the
08:03 - cool thing about this is that i'd say if
08:05 - you don't have the money for mac
08:06 - then go into windows and use a dual boot
08:09 - between windows
08:10 - and linux ubuntu because
08:13 - right now linux is really cool like
08:15 - logan is saying he says
08:16 - linux is wicked cool everything free and
08:18 - fast yes it's really cool but at the
08:20 - same time it's
08:21 - super duper duper limited i mean have
08:23 - you guys ever used an ubuntu
08:25 - operating system it's cool it looks
08:27 - beautiful it's so customizable
08:29 - but really bro like how many
08:30 - customizations are you gonna do to it
08:32 - it's awesome but you can't even download
08:34 - you know basic things like
08:36 - vlc like vlc player and other or i don't
08:40 - know if vlc is now for you for unix
08:42 - for linux sorry but my point is that
08:45 - there's so
08:46 - little software for unix and if that's
08:48 - your primary machine then you're just
08:50 - going to be so limited not only as a
08:52 - developer
08:53 - but as a human so don't go into that
08:56 - route of
08:56 - just using ubuntu trying to be a hipster
08:59 - just because
09:00 - you think that nobody uses it i mean
09:02 - honestly i'd say use windows if you're
09:04 - gonna have that
09:05 - and then download ubuntu as a dual boot
09:07 - you know
09:08 - software so off the bat here we go with
09:10 - the first
09:11 - actual recommendation that i will give
09:13 - you guys for these
09:14 - laptops i think the dell xps if you're
09:17 - using windows
09:18 - is a great great laptop and people have
09:21 - gone crazy with it just because it's a
09:23 - great
09:24 - laptop for gaming it's uh one of dell's
09:27 - you know flagship products it's been
09:29 - going it's been you know
09:31 - delivering these specific series for i
09:33 - think like since 2010 or 13
09:36 - it's beautiful because it's very
09:38 - lightweight all dell computers in my
09:40 - opinion have very
09:41 - good um very good build and they also
09:44 - last a few years but
09:46 - what i do want to say is that you know
09:48 - now more than ever their screens are
09:50 - starting to become really good
09:52 - and that's something that i like about
09:54 - mac is that their screens are very good
09:55 - you know
09:56 - coming up with a retina display in 2015
09:59 - it just kind of changed the game man
10:00 - so off the bat dell xps i'm saying bro
10:03 - if you use windows
10:04 - get try to get at least 16 gigabytes of
10:07 - ram don't try to use
10:08 - or get you know freaking let me see if i
10:12 - can pull this up here
10:14 - if i can let's see screen brush here we
10:18 - go
10:18 - so in my opinion guys i mean if you are
10:22 - using
10:23 - dell and windows have a 16 gigabytes
10:27 - 16 gig gigabytes of ram okay
10:31 - and if you can't do that then at least
10:34 - do 8 gigabytes of ram so
10:39 - i mean you're not spending that much
10:40 - money i think that's going to be very
10:42 - important right now i believe that i7
10:44 - processors
10:46 - give me one minute here guys let me
10:50 - bust out of here go deep into this again
10:53 - and actually let me see cool
10:58 - so awesome there we go so
11:01 - if you are using this
11:05 - dell as your thing then you're going to
11:08 - want to get 60 gigabytes of ram
11:10 - and then you're going to want to get at
11:11 - least an i7 processor
11:13 - if you're using if you're using intel
11:16 - but if you're using amd
11:17 - then i'd say get at least a quad core
11:21 - quad-core processor or maybe even a six
11:25 - core six core
11:28 - and i'd say that the specifications as
11:30 - long as they're higher than
11:32 - 2.0 2.0 gigahertz
11:36 - on the processor then you're good so
11:39 - this is going to be kind of my
11:41 - recommendation for you guys if you guys
11:43 - you know are going to use windows i
11:45 - believe 16 gigabytes is the way to go an
11:47 - i7 maybe even a 99
11:50 - i9 is going to be better for you and
11:53 - then if you're using amd
11:56 - then get a quad core or get a 6 core
11:59 - with amd's i don't remember what they're
12:00 - called
12:01 - but all of them should be at least
12:03 - higher than 2.0 gigahertz
12:05 - per second so that's my recommendation
12:08 - with the dell
12:09 - xps i believe it's a great computer and
12:12 - now going up to the runner-ups
12:14 - let's see what's next so let me get out
12:18 - of there
12:18 - here we go we got the microsoft surface
12:21 - it's not the three let's actually
12:23 - switch that now it's not the three
12:26 - because right now we're at
12:27 - you know model seven but microsoft
12:30 - surface
12:31 - edition is a really really good
12:33 - microsoft uh
12:35 - alternative for programming just because
12:38 - they try to get
12:39 - that feel of you know the macbooks but
12:42 - the cool thing about this is that
12:43 - it's a two in one computer so that's
12:45 - pretty freaking awesome guys
12:47 - and the cool thing about microsoft
12:48 - surface is that you can either
12:50 - use it with the keyboard or not i mean
12:53 - obviously if your programming you might
12:54 - want to use it with a keyboard it's
12:56 - going to be hard for you to type on the
12:57 - screen
12:58 - but it's cool to know that you have at
12:59 - least that option but the cool thing
13:00 - about microsoft surface
13:02 - is that it doesn't require anything too
13:04 - fancy and yet
13:05 - it's a really fast computer and you can
13:07 - do very lightweight
13:09 - you know things with it as in you can
13:11 - emit weight
13:12 - things with it because it doesn't have
13:13 - an integrated video card i think some do
13:16 - the pros too i believe but even then
13:19 - they're very limited
13:20 - i don't see any of these having a four
13:22 - gigabyte you know video card
13:24 - and even though that might not be so
13:26 - important for your programming
13:27 - i think it's important for the way that
13:28 - you use computers so if you're
13:30 - programming you're going to be doing
13:31 - other things in the background that are
13:32 - going to affect your code it's not just
13:34 - about
13:34 - where the code runs i know that you know
13:37 - video cards are very important for you
13:38 - if you're doing deep learning
13:40 - but at the same time they're they're
13:42 - important for everything
13:43 - so and something that i say is if you
13:46 - can pretty much
13:47 - edit a video on a computer you can
13:48 - pretty much code with it really well
13:50 - most of the time at least so that's a
13:52 - good one so you guys know that razer has
13:54 - been going
13:55 - crazy on the laptop game on these last
13:58 - years
13:58 - people you know are going to razer as
14:01 - one of the the biggest like the
14:02 - best flagship products for windows just
14:05 - because of their build quality
14:06 - and it's something that windows was
14:08 - missing from its market so i'm glad the
14:10 - razer was able to actually bring it
14:11 - here for you guys and so let me see what
14:14 - what other things do i want to mention
14:16 - about razer
14:17 - it is good for gaming and another
14:20 - awesome thing
14:20 - about it is that it's very lightweight
14:22 - so you can carry it around everywhere
14:24 - the 15-inch model is my favorite in my
14:27 - opinion
14:28 - i think they even have the 14 inch
14:30 - models but i mean from 14 to 15 just get
14:32 - 15 guys come on
14:34 - i think the bigger screen for you guys
14:35 - are get is going to be the most
14:37 - important just because you're looking at
14:39 - code every single day guys
14:41 - so here too you know if i was getting a
14:44 - razor
14:45 - i try to say at least 16 gigabytes ram
14:47 - let's
14:48 - let's do that so it stays 16 gigabytes
14:50 - ram
14:51 - at least a two gigabyte
14:54 - two gigabyte dc video card
14:58 - two gigabyte video card and then an i7
15:04 - processor so
15:07 - we got this and obviously you need that
15:10 - ssd
15:11 - so i would say get an ssd of
15:15 - 500 gigabytes so
15:18 - guys you are going you know you are
15:21 - going the windows route
15:23 - it might not be that that expensive for
15:26 - you guys
15:26 - but if you're doing this on a mac this
15:29 - this would probably cost you around
15:30 - two to three k to get on a mac but if
15:33 - you're doing it on the windows it might
15:34 - just
15:35 - cost you even 800 bucks or less so
15:38 - that's the cool thing about going into
15:40 - windows you can actually do this
15:41 - for the for your budget you know
15:44 - so those are great builds i think it's
15:46 - it's not bad if you choose them
15:48 - i just want to mention that there's
15:50 - going to be a few things and i'm going
15:51 - to mention it on the other slides if you
15:53 - do use windows you're going to be very
15:55 - very limited
15:56 - but other than that i feel like it's a
15:58 - great you know
15:59 - type of alternative if you don't have
16:01 - the money for a macbook pro
16:03 - so you know going a little bit deeper
16:05 - into everything else we can do
16:07 - i feel like and give me one second here
16:10 - guys i wanna
16:11 - get out of this and then start moving
16:13 - this an hp spectre
16:15 - is gonna be another good good option for
16:17 - you i know the hp spectre has been
16:20 - on going on for a few years now probably
16:22 - about four or five years
16:24 - and it's it's kind of like the razer of
16:26 - hp so
16:27 - they went deep into the build quality
16:29 - they have amazing
16:31 - you know keyboards i really like them
16:32 - the screens is something that i want to
16:34 - emphasize you guys are looking at code
16:35 - every day so make sure
16:36 - that you're able to see the most amount
16:38 - of code on that screen
16:40 - so that's why i say choose the 15 inch
16:42 - also make sure to
16:44 - get very good um screen to pixel ratio i
16:47 - don't remember what
16:48 - what it's called specifically but make
16:50 - sure that your screen it has very good
16:52 - legibility so you can actually
16:54 - read from it okay so a lot of windows
16:57 - computers i can see a lot of pixels in
16:59 - them even to this date
17:01 - they're trying to you know maybe
17:04 - skip this skim themselves out a little
17:06 - bit on the actual screen
17:08 - but i feel like that just changes the
17:10 - whole experience of
17:12 - that computer so hp spectre is going to
17:15 - be a good other option
17:17 - and in my opinion i i was going to add
17:18 - the pixel book but i decided to add this
17:20 - instead just because i think it's a
17:22 - little bit more of a powerhouse
17:23 - it's been proven through time i'd say
17:25 - still get
17:26 - at least eight gigabytes to 16 gigabytes
17:28 - on the hp spectre
17:30 - 16 gigabytes to be honest if you can get
17:32 - that ssd the i7
17:34 - processor or i9 nowadays and please you
17:38 - know don't
17:38 - in my opinion if this is your build uh
17:42 - and you're using a windows let's say you
17:43 - have an i3 processor let's actually open
17:46 - it up
17:47 - so let's say you have an i let's say
17:50 - i 3 processor
17:53 - and you have a 250
17:58 - gigabyte
18:01 - and then it's going to be a hard drive
18:03 - not even not not even a
18:05 - not even a what's it called an ssd it's
18:07 - a hard drive
18:08 - you got this this and then let's say you
18:11 - got
18:12 - six gigabytes of ram
18:18 - this is actually a pretty normal build
18:21 - for very economic computers i'd say
18:23 - so most people that end up you know
18:25 - buying their first computer they have
18:26 - something similar to this
18:28 - they have in either i3 or a dual core
18:31 - dual core with amd
18:36 - amd right so i3 or dual core with amd
18:40 - uh 250 gigabytes or 500 gigabytes hard
18:44 - drive
18:44 - not an ssd then six gigabytes of ram if
18:46 - you have
18:47 - this type of build for your computer
18:49 - you're gonna run into a lot of problems
18:51 - so at least
18:52 - i'd say try to get an i
18:56 - i five let me actually leave it on
18:58 - screen so
19:00 - damn it let me see okay there we go
19:03 - i clicked it again but there we go so i
19:07 - i5 and then get maybe a 250
19:11 - gigabyte you know ssd
19:16 - and then get at least eight
19:20 - gigabytes of ram
19:24 - and this is my example for low budget
19:28 - computers so if you have
19:31 - this at least you're not going to be
19:33 - that bad and if you can get a video card
19:36 - of at least 1.5
19:39 - gigabytes of video card
19:43 - i think you're set if you have this this
19:45 - is pretty decent you might not need
19:46 - anything
19:47 - else if you're doing very lightweight
19:49 - tasks like maybe using visual studio
19:51 - code
19:51 - running javascript or something like
19:52 - that i think this is
19:54 - okay but this is for the low budget
19:56 - built i would
19:57 - not really recommend this if you can go
20:00 - maybe i7 i89
20:02 - 500 gigabytes ssd and then 16 gigabytes
20:04 - of ram with a 2
20:06 - gigabytes plus video card of ram
20:09 - so that would be my example another good
20:11 - one is the zen book
20:12 - zen book is awesome they're coming up
20:14 - with different styles nowadays for all
20:16 - of these
20:16 - you know years it's been kind of crazy i
20:19 - like their build quality it's amazing
20:21 - i also like the keyboards how they have
20:23 - them i mean i think it's it kind of
20:24 - sucks that i don't have every computer
20:26 - here with me so that you guys can
20:27 - actually check it out
20:28 - but i think that would be actually
20:29 - really dope but asus is really cool
20:32 - because they used to make
20:33 - motherboards they were kind of like on
20:34 - the background making motherboards
20:36 - but now they're using computers that
20:37 - look very aesthetically pleasing
20:39 - and are actually very reliable the cool
20:42 - thing about them is that they're
20:43 - actually very fast so i'd say the same
20:45 - thing 16 gigabytes ram
20:47 - minimum with at least two gigabytes of
20:49 - video card you know memory
20:51 - and i think that would be a great
20:54 - option for it but now we're gonna we're
20:57 - gonna show you guys the macbook pro
20:59 - 16 inches within in my opinion it's
21:01 - going to be the best laptop for you to
21:03 - use
21:03 - in programming hands down hands down i
21:06 - think it even deserves a freaking
21:11 - so you know i feel like this computer
21:14 - right now is a great
21:16 - computer because one i love that they
21:19 - added the escape button
21:20 - because i hated the fact that the bar
21:23 - was just
21:24 - so touch you know what i mean like it
21:26 - was just touch it was just like
21:27 - kind of if you're using your phone but
21:29 - it felt kind of like
21:30 - so less somebody's saying windows 12 is
21:33 - best
21:34 - i'm gonna block you guys if you guys
21:36 - keep on just repeating something
21:38 - you know please keep it clean we're all
21:39 - trying to learn here and
21:41 - talking about macbook pro man macbooks
21:43 - are insane in my opinion i
21:45 - like i said i was using windows my whole
21:47 - life let's actually take
21:49 - this off i was using windows my whole
21:51 - life but then decided to go into mac
21:54 - and it really did change everything and
21:56 - if you're
21:57 - using a mac surprisingly you might need
21:59 - a little bit less specs to run your code
22:01 - because mac
22:02 - is actually very fast it's clean the way
22:04 - that it runs
22:05 - so in my opinion if you're using i mean
22:08 - the macbook pro
22:09 - i'll go deeper into what what you should
22:11 - run with it i think
22:12 - you know at least 16 to 32 gigabytes of
22:14 - ram would be insane
22:16 - let's let's actually go into that a
22:17 - little bit faster so
22:19 - 16 gigabytes of ram for this one
22:22 - 232 gigabytes i'm using right now the 32
22:25 - gigabytes
22:26 - one and it's amazing guys and also at
22:29 - least 2.5
22:31 - if you can gigabytes of
22:35 - video card so this one has intel video
22:39 - cards with amd video card put together
22:41 - so intel
22:42 - graphics integrated with uh it's i think
22:45 - it's 1.5
22:46 - gigabytes of integrated video graphics
22:49 - of intel
22:49 - and then a 1.5 or 2.5
22:53 - of amd video card uh and this is a
22:56 - dedicated video card
22:57 - and this is going to be important
22:58 - important for your build like right now
23:00 - you know most of the time we're coding
23:01 - and we're actually building stuff
23:03 - but at the same time we're also live
23:05 - streaming with you guys so we need
23:06 - machines that can withstand that amount
23:08 - of power to do this
23:10 - and this one has an i9 processor so
23:13 - i believe this is this is either a six
23:15 - core and eight core processor
23:17 - but it's amazing and then it obviously
23:19 - has an ssd
23:20 - of one terabyte you can get it two
23:23 - terabytes whatever i mean after one
23:25 - terabyte i think
23:26 - you're pretty much good so this is
23:29 - pretty much
23:30 - i think in my opinion the perfect
23:31 - perfect model that you can use
23:34 - for you know the specs that you can use
23:36 - for your macbook
23:38 - if you're using a macbook because in my
23:41 - opinion like i said macbooks are
23:42 - the best laptops for programming hands
23:46 - down just because it's gonna
23:47 - make everything so so much less
23:50 - complicated
23:51 - and so you know i'll give you guys this
23:54 - is an example of one that you can build
23:56 - very well
23:57 - and would actually stand the test of
23:59 - time you can probably have this for at
24:01 - least
24:01 - three even maybe even four years
24:03 - actually if you have this type of build
24:06 - 16 gigabytes it's a little bit outdated
24:08 - in my opinion you should be going to 32
24:10 - already because 16 is kind of like
24:14 - i think i think it's fine to be honest
24:15 - with you i think it's fine you're
24:16 - probably not going to need anything more
24:18 - than that
24:18 - but if you want that's probably going to
24:19 - last you maybe like two more years or
24:21 - something like that in my opinion
24:22 - but let's say you have a little bit less
24:24 - money and you still want to
24:27 - you know use the macbook i'd say a good
24:30 - build for macbooks
24:32 - would be maybe you know the eight
24:35 - gigabyte
24:36 - let me actually keep it there so eight
24:39 - gigabytes with a laptop with a macbook
24:42 - sorry
24:43 - and run maybe an i5 processor
24:46 - i think that's good and then also the
24:49 - video card for it to be
24:51 - 1.5 and i even think that's a little bit
24:55 - small video card
24:59 - a dedicated video card okay not an
25:01 - integrated video card
25:02 - you know if you have a macbook air
25:03 - macbook airs do have
25:06 - integrated cards which is not the same
25:08 - integrated graphics it's not the same as
25:10 - a dedicated
25:11 - video card so eight gigabytes this this
25:14 - i would still suggest an ssd so i'd say
25:16 - 500 gigabyte
25:20 - ssd so if you have this or if you have
25:24 - an i7
25:25 - i believe this build for max is gonna be
25:28 - insane for you
25:29 - it's gonna be really really good so if
25:31 - you're coming from windows and
25:33 - and you're like damn i really wanna code
25:36 - in mac
25:37 - what do i wanna do mac also have heating
25:38 - issues no they don't
25:40 - max don't really have heating issues man
25:42 - if you're building your own pcs
25:44 - that's when you're going to have a lot
25:45 - of heating issues raul mandal says that
25:48 - and no bro you know if you're most most
25:51 - desktops have bad heating issues if
25:54 - you're using a windows
25:56 - desktop that you built if you're using a
25:58 - mac
25:59 - heating issues are even getting better
26:01 - in in the 2013 to 2015 models
26:06 - or 2012 to 2015 models the
26:09 - fan would get on would turn on really
26:11 - fast and try to you know
26:13 - it would make a lot of sound i didn't
26:14 - like it but after the 2016 model
26:17 - they started getting you know their heat
26:19 - maintained very very well
26:21 - so the fans on the 16 2016
26:25 - up versions of the macbooks are insane
26:27 - they're really really good
26:28 - you know right now i'm using a macbook
26:30 - to run this whole live stream and it's
26:32 - pretty good it's very buttery so it's
26:35 - amazing
26:37 - and like i say this is the one that i
26:39 - would suggest if you
26:40 - have a budget for macbook so guys i know
26:44 - maybe macbooks might be expensive for
26:46 - you but at the same time guys
26:47 - you know save up some money i think a
26:49 - good good good way to
26:51 - buy a macbook would be buy a refurbished
26:53 - one so don't buy a new one
26:54 - buy a refurbished one you'll save
26:56 - yourself hundreds of dollars
26:58 - for the same thing you'll also you can
27:00 - also buy used ones so
27:02 - if you don't buy a refurbished one buy a
27:04 - used mac and that's gonna be better for
27:06 - you than some other windows
27:07 - products and that's not me hitting on
27:09 - windows that's literally just my
27:11 - experience i love windows computers
27:13 - especially for gaming man but if you're
27:15 - trying to code if you're trying to do
27:16 - something sleek with with your time and
27:18 - also your code
27:19 - then go with those specific things on
27:21 - the macbook
27:22 - and like i said macbook in my opinion
27:24 - would be the best bet
27:26 - as computer as a laptop to use for
27:28 - programming
27:29 - but let's say that you weren't able to
27:32 - have a macbook for whatever reason
27:34 - then for you your best bet would be
27:36 - definitely use a windows
27:38 - computer but use ubuntu as a dual boot
27:42 - okay a dual boot so what you're gonna do
27:45 - is you're gonna buy a windows pc because
27:47 - they normally don't sell ubuntu pcs
27:49 - ubuntu is a type of
27:50 - it's a version of using linux right
27:53 - so so what's cool about this is that you
27:57 - can have your windows pc you can buy you
27:59 - know the whole setup with windows even
28:00 - build your own pc and ubuntu
28:02 - is free so just install it as a dual
28:04 - boot in your computer
28:05 - you can have best of both worlds and
28:06 - once you start you know coding you can
28:08 - just use ubuntu but once you're using
28:10 - your computers like normal
28:11 - then you just use windows and that's
28:12 - totally fine too i've had experience
28:14 - doing that running it myself
28:16 - it's actually really enjoyable i like it
28:17 - man i like ubuntu a little bit but like
28:19 - i said it's very very limited in terms
28:20 - of the software that it provides for the
28:22 - users
28:23 - and so that's why i wouldn't use it in
28:24 - the long term but at the same time i
28:26 - mean i know that a lot of companies use
28:27 - ubuntu
28:28 - as their go to you know os
28:31 - and they actually use them on virtual
28:34 - machines so they have it on windows but
28:36 - they run it on virtual machine instead
28:37 - of windows
28:38 - which literally just means that you're
28:39 - running an operating system instead of
28:41 - another operating system and that's okay
28:43 - but i'd say use the dual boot option
28:45 - with ubuntu and windows
28:47 - and here i kind of i just put pixel
28:50 - versus surface versus
28:51 - then it's a macbook my opinion i just
28:53 - like this photo i mean i didn't put the
28:55 - pixel i was going to put it but then i
28:56 - decided to put the hp spectre
28:58 - using all of these this is the the
29:00 - surface book
29:01 - in my opinion between these three the
29:03 - macbook is just
29:04 - the winner you know without a single
29:07 - doubt
29:08 - in my mind the macbook is just the
29:09 - winner i mean whatever you want to say
29:12 - man like at the end of the day it's all
29:14 - about efficiency reliability
29:16 - and quality in my opinion so you know if
29:19 - you're gonna get
29:20 - better overall in almost everything just
29:22 - invest a little bit more money into the
29:24 - macbook pro
29:25 - and i wouldn't suggest the macbook air
29:27 - just because i don't like the fact that
29:29 - it doesn't have
29:30 - that it doesn't have dedicated graphics
29:32 - it has integrated graphics and that's
29:34 - going to slow down
29:35 - the way that you use your computer a lot
29:37 - even if you're just using chrome or
29:39 - doing something very very you know
29:42 - not as demanding as as maybe i don't
29:45 - know running a
29:46 - high definition video or something like
29:48 - that so one of the biggest
29:50 - important things about mac is that you
29:53 - know i do want to explain about
29:55 - the display differences in mac so after
29:58 - the retina
29:59 - the retina display came out right in the
30:01 - display came out i think in 2015
30:04 - with that was the first model man it
30:07 - just changed completely
30:09 - everything it's like you can see things
30:11 - in 1080p
30:12 - that and this is this is how it looked
30:15 - like the size that it would look like
30:16 - the screen resolution how it would look
30:18 - like
30:18 - and then the retina display just makes
30:21 - it so much
30:22 - crispier now you don't have to see the
30:25 - pixels on each text
30:26 - so this text rendering on screens on mac
30:29 - is
30:30 - just amazing and that's a huge part of
30:32 - coding
30:33 - definitely so you know one of the
30:35 - biggest things about it
30:37 - is that you're going to be looking at
30:38 - text your whole freaking day
30:40 - so you don't want to be looking at text
30:42 - that looks very pixely it's going to
30:43 - hurt your eyes
30:44 - plus it's going to be harder for you to
30:46 - read plus then all of that gets
30:48 - compounded and you're spending more time
30:49 - looking at code
30:50 - more time thinking about things you have
30:52 - less energy it all compounds and makes
30:54 - it
30:55 - harder for you to keep using that
30:57 - computer and i
30:58 - i know for a fact from my own experience
31:00 - i was using this hp
31:02 - what was it it was an hp envy computer
31:06 - very recently that was another that was
31:08 - another one of the options that i
31:10 - thought of putting in here
31:11 - but i decided not to just because i
31:12 - thought it was like way too economic
31:14 - and you guys can you know using what i
31:17 - just taught you guys
31:18 - about what i think a decent build would
31:20 - be for computers
31:21 - but in my opinion you know most of those
31:23 - screens just look a little bit like this
31:26 - and i cannot
31:27 - stare at them for long periods of time
31:29 - so
31:30 - one of the biggest things about the
31:32 - macbook is the fact that
31:33 - you know everything is so much easier on
31:36 - macbook you're not going to be able to
31:38 - follow
31:38 - you know some tutorials that you see on
31:40 - the web another thing is that
31:42 - the command line with macbook is using
31:44 - unix
31:45 - and windows is not using unix i believe
31:48 - they said that they had
31:49 - now bash in the new windows but at the
31:52 - same time it's not
31:53 - the same as using this specific command
31:55 - line so
31:56 - here i put a little part of an article
31:58 - it says macs
31:59 - run full-time on unix-based operating
32:01 - system and they are thus
32:03 - more developer friendly this explains
32:06 - why macs are the way to go for many
32:07 - developers
32:08 - with the unix-based command line
32:10 - programming is easier as you're able to
32:12 - run programs in almost any
32:14 - language so you can just install python
32:16 - like nothing on mac
32:18 - and it's gonna be very very hard for you
32:19 - to do that on another
32:21 - programming language i mean sorry
32:22 - another operating system and
32:25 - man it's just gonna save you so much
32:27 - time let's say you're following somebody
32:28 - else's tutorials let's say you're in
32:30 - school and
32:31 - you don't wanna spend so much time
32:32 - setting things up mac
32:34 - is gonna be the way to go another thing
32:36 - is that unix is also
32:38 - more secure by default compared to
32:40 - windows
32:41 - this is the reason why mags tend to be
32:44 - safer against the tools that hackers
32:46 - use such as malwares trojan horses and
32:48 - viruses
32:49 - and the reason because the reason why
32:50 - that is is because
32:52 - most of the people in the world use
32:54 - windows so
32:55 - there's a bigger pool of people using
32:57 - windows so
32:58 - obviously if you're a hacker then you
33:00 - know you're going to want to target
33:02 - windows because so many more people use
33:04 - windows
33:04 - and mac and because of that reason
33:07 - there's more malicious
33:08 - softwares and hackers in these platforms
33:11 - such as windows
33:12 - and ubuntu well i mean nobody has that
33:14 - so nobody wants to target that to be
33:15 - honest with you or unix i mean
33:17 - or linux is nobody's going to want to
33:19 - target that because nobody really uses
33:21 - linux and linux sorry
33:24 - so that's a little bit about that but in
33:27 - my opinion i mean if you're into cyber
33:28 - security if you're into
33:30 - those type of you know professions then
33:33 - i'd say use windows because that's
33:34 - probably the
33:35 - command line that you're going to be
33:36 - using that's really why people want to
33:40 - you know hire you so that you can either
33:41 - develop antivirus software or just
33:44 - you know anti anti-malicious software or
33:47 - just protocols and things like that so
33:49 - if you're having any of those type of
33:51 - careers then i'd say use windows but if
33:53 - not if you're just doing
33:54 - software development use macs and this
33:57 - is kind of just you know the
33:59 - the command line on mac right now so
34:00 - let's see what you guys are saying
34:02 - at least the macbook pro yep so
34:07 - which os is most used in it professional
34:10 - work
34:11 - nicoon asks and so in it in my opinion
34:15 - the most use is going to be windows
34:17 - there's a lot of
34:18 - softwares like wireshark that you would
34:20 - use on windows i think it's
34:22 - it's also on mac but everything is done
34:24 - on windows man because you're
34:25 - trying to you know work with networks
34:27 - and windows has a very good
34:30 - um you know latch on that they can
34:32 - actually
34:33 - work very well with with specific you
34:36 - know
34:37 - software i mean um network type of of
34:40 - work
34:41 - so like i said if you guys are following
34:44 - any tutorial this is
34:45 - an example of an xcode tutorial that
34:47 - somebody's following
34:48 - and they're making an app here off the
34:50 - bat to begin with
34:52 - you guys are just going to see so many
34:54 - more lines of code
34:56 - even if you're using you know mac versus
34:59 - windows
35:00 - because the way that they
35:03 - the way that they you know tend to have
35:06 - their screen resolution is just gonna be
35:08 - a little bit bigger their screens have
35:10 - better quality
35:11 - and the 16 by nine ratio is
35:14 - really really nice on these but the fact
35:16 - that you can look at
35:17 - these words without them being very
35:19 - pixel it's going to be great for you
35:21 - plus the the whole development
35:23 - environment is going to be insane on the
35:24 - macbook pro
35:25 - just because like i said python can run
35:28 - on it like nothing
35:29 - almost by default and other things like
35:33 - just installing for example visual
35:35 - studio code your developer
35:37 - environment is going to be way way
35:39 - easier to have it set up there
35:40 - in windows you have to move all these
35:43 - knobs all these things like you have to
35:45 - download so many packages for you
35:47 - it's always telling you to get updated
35:50 - then you got to make sure that your
35:51 - drivers are on point
35:53 - and you got to make sure that you know
35:54 - it's so many things and then mac makes
35:56 - it so easy for you to just
35:58 - be ready with everything so macbook pro
36:01 - is going to be the way to go if you do
36:03 - have the money for that if you don't
36:04 - like i said use windows with
36:06 - ubuntu as dual boot but you know in
36:08 - conclusion guys
36:09 - like you guys might have seen right now
36:10 - because i just clicked it we got to this
36:12 - little monkey right here and this is
36:13 - how you don't want to feel when choosing
36:16 - your
36:17 - laptop for programming in 2020 guys just
36:19 - because of the fact that like i said
36:21 - guys it's going to take us
36:22 - all the way to the to the beginning
36:25 - obviously think about your endpoint what
36:26 - do you want to do with programming if
36:28 - you're going to be doing
36:29 - software for macs then you're going to
36:30 - need a mac computer if you're going to
36:32 - do
36:33 - other things that don't require anything
36:34 - related to the macbook developer
36:36 - environment then you can use windows but
36:40 - think about it as well so then be like
36:42 - okay so what's the budget that i want to
36:44 - think of
36:44 - if you're trying to do 800 giga 800 or
36:47 - less with a budget
36:49 - i'd say try to get an ssd and try to
36:51 - make it eight gigabytes of
36:53 - ram at least if you can do a little bit
36:56 - more of money than that
36:57 - then i'd say you know obviously get the
37:00 - 16 gigabytes ram
37:01 - get the 500 gigabyte ssd and try to get
37:04 - a dedicated video card
37:06 - don't be using integrated video cards
37:08 - not only because
37:09 - maybe the code doesn't use the video
37:11 - card the fact of
37:13 - the matter the fact is gonna be that
37:14 - you're gonna be doing other things on
37:15 - your computer
37:16 - while doing the code so you don't wanna
37:18 - limit yourself just by thinking like oh
37:20 - i'm gonna use my whole computer for
37:22 - code nope everything like really affects
37:24 - the way that you code
37:25 - so you know let's say you're doing a
37:28 - design on the other screen
37:29 - then you're gonna want a computer that
37:31 - has very good screens so that you can
37:33 - see the pixels and
37:35 - actually see the spacing make sure the
37:36 - proportions are good all of these things
37:39 - are going to be part of
37:40 - this so off the back guys i do want to
37:42 - say
37:43 - thank you so much like i said macbook
37:45 - pro would be the best
37:47 - and ideal way to go if you want to get a
37:50 - really killer computer in 2024
37:53 - programming specifically
37:54 - it's going to be easier for you to set
37:56 - up your your developer environment it's
37:58 - going to be
37:59 - easier for you to see on the screen just
38:01 - because of the
38:02 - good screen ratio that it has the 16 by
38:05 - nine ratio
38:06 - together with the great quality displays
38:08 - that mac
38:09 - has for you guys whether that's the
38:10 - retina display or even the newer lcd
38:12 - displays that they're doing
38:14 - they have really good backlight another
38:16 - thing is going to be their keyboards
38:17 - they used to have the
38:18 - butterfly keyboard it's not that great
38:20 - in my opinion but now after the 2020
38:22 - model
38:23 - and i believe the 2019 16 inch one then
38:26 - the keyboard started to be very very
38:28 - decent so that's going to be awesome
38:30 - so remember guys that if you can do 16
38:33 - gigabytes ram
38:34 - at least on ram because it's gonna
38:37 - affect the way that you move around your
38:39 - computer
38:39 - eight gigabytes for a mac is okay but
38:42 - i'd say
38:43 - still you know push to get the 16
38:44 - gigabytes also
38:46 - another thing i want to mention is the
38:48 - fact that you know command line
38:50 - on mac is like i said unix based
38:53 - and not and windows is not so that's
38:55 - going to save you a lot of time in
38:56 - running your apps pushing them to github
38:58 - all of these things and like i mentioned
39:00 - the quality
39:01 - and then just following the tutorials
39:03 - it's going to be so much more easier for
39:04 - you to pick up a language if you can
39:06 - just really
39:07 - forget about everything that is around
39:09 - you and you just don't have to worry
39:11 - about the environment
39:12 - of your of your programming that much
39:14 - you know you don't have to worry about
39:15 - downloading a bunch of packages for you
39:17 - to start coding
39:18 - if you can just do it pretty much out of
39:19 - the box then your skill set is just
39:21 - going to go from here to here
39:22 - that much more faster so make sure to
39:25 - not only invest
39:27 - in you know maybe how you think a
39:29 - machine will
39:30 - will end up you know costing and how
39:33 - much you're going to be using it think
39:34 - about
39:35 - the fact of the quality of
39:38 - the everyday usage of it so you know
39:41 - maybe you're gonna be thinking like oh
39:43 - damn like
39:44 - i want to save a little bit of money but
39:46 - at the same time i'm losing a lot of
39:48 - time
39:48 - because i cannot even read the code on
39:50 - my screen so don't think like that guys
39:52 - you know really make an investment
39:54 - a laptop is a really great investment if
39:56 - you're doing programming it's going to
39:58 - be one of
39:58 - your most important investments so make
40:00 - sure that not only do you get
40:01 - a computer that can actually run your
40:03 - code very well but it helps you do other
40:05 - things on the site like watch videos
40:07 - look at designs
40:08 - because in videos you're going to see
40:09 - tutorials because in designs it's going
40:11 - to help you build your projects and then
40:12 - render projects you know maybe even push
40:14 - projects to
40:15 - to a git repository or anything like
40:17 - that so all of those things are going to
40:18 - be part that
40:19 - make up the requirements for your
40:21 - computer
40:23 - but like i said guys those pretty much
40:25 - are the things that i would recommend
40:26 - for you guys
40:27 - you guys can get anything you want but
40:29 - macbook pro is going to be the best bet
40:32 - the best bang for your buck ultimately
40:34 - for most development
40:35 - you know environments careers and things
40:38 - of the sort
40:38 - so with that said guys you know if you
40:41 - guys are really enjoying this content if
40:43 - you guys want to keep
40:44 - up to date with what we're putting out
40:46 - on the daily because it is really
40:48 - fire content we're making a bunch of
40:50 - clones whether that's
40:52 - you know the hula clone youtube clone
40:54 - tinder clones all of these clones we're
40:55 - putting them together for you guys
40:57 - in the next weeks we're gonna actually
40:59 - drop a react
41:01 - video and you guys should very much stay
41:03 - tuned for it and also
41:05 - if you guys are enjoying this type of
41:06 - content and you want to learn a little
41:08 - bit more about
41:09 - how to become a profitable javascript
41:11 - developer go into our free training down
41:13 - below on the description
41:15 - and you're going to see that we have a
41:16 - webinar for you that kazi did with a lot
41:18 - of a lot of love and it's going to teach
41:20 - you exactly how to
41:21 - start from the beginning to become a
41:23 - profitable javascript developer
41:25 - and also you know check out profit with
41:28 - javascript as well if you guys
41:30 - want to do the same thing this is our
41:32 - course our flagship course that teaches
41:34 - you
41:34 - just that so with that said guys it was
41:37 - a pleasure to be with you guys
41:39 - uh the first thing got actually cut off
41:42 - so i'm gonna put together the video so
41:44 - you guys can actually see it in one
41:46 - specific take so i do apologize because
41:49 - of that we got a bunch of technical
41:51 - issues some days some days it's perfect
41:53 - but with that said
41:54 - macbook pro number one as the best
41:57 - laptop
41:58 - for programming in 2020 other than that
42:00 - there's a few other options that i
42:02 - listed for you guys and make sure to
42:03 - check out those specs that i'm telling
42:05 - you
42:05 - make them the minimum that you can get
42:07 - and if you can invest a little bit more
42:09 - money
42:09 - do it it's going to be very very worth
42:11 - it all right guys this was frankie for
42:13 - y'all
42:13 - take it easy much love peace bye

Cleaned transcript:

yo what is up guys how's it going frankie here from cleverprogrammer so we were actually in the middle of the livestream when it just kind of cut down man that's pretty insane what i did want to talk about guys is the fact that you know i think we should still continue everything from where i left off just so you guys can have an idea of what is going on and so give me one second here guys let me actually double check what's going on here so awesome we left off in the actual ssd i was giving a little bit of of that what people were looking at or people were hearing i could hear it myself so now i believe we're good let me see one second so so we're going to talk about what is going on so best ssds versus the actual give me one second beautiful here we go so we got the best ssds right versus the hard drives and i'm just going to continue from where i left off after the end of this we're going to actually put together the whole video and then share with you guys in a simple format where you can just watch the best laptops for programming in 2020 i'm glad you guys are back thank you guys for everything and stick to the end the like i said the other live stream crash crashed now we're gonna go ahead and move forward with the whole teaching because you know i don't want to make any excuses for you guys we're gonna move right ahead so off the bat guys i believe that you know going back to this this is an ssd solid state drive hard drive and a hard drive so let's take drive and a hard drive so hard drives have components on them where they actually move they're physically making movement and off the bat they're making the calculations like that and ssds are just solid state drives so they never really move they're they kind of behave like ram ram is i believe it's a sort of solid state drive but it's actually used in memory so that's why it's not that bad and cool so that is one and then going into the actual differences between ssd and hard drive right now so ssd is awesome because it's like more than 10 times faster a lot of times than the actual hard drive this is an example of a laptop file transfer test rate to copy five gigabytes pretty much in megabytes higher is better so this is 237 megabytes this would be i don't know how many gigabytes how much how many gigabytes is that none because one gigabyte would be one thousand so awesome so 237 megabytes versus 33 megabytes that's almost what is that that's like eight times that's literally like eight times faster ssd is eight times faster so you're gonna want to have a great ace ssd card if you are programming instead of using a hard drive because hard drives right now actually are a little bit outdated i don't think you should even use them at all and the minimum i'd say for a hard drive or an ssd right now to be honest with you guys would be 500 gigabytes unless you're not doing anything important on your computer if you're doing something that's like it doesn't really matter then 256 you know gigabytes might be okay for you but at the same time you know you can always get external ssds external hard drives um i believe that you know it's better for you to just get 500 off to start if you can do 1000 ssd 1000 terabyte ssd so going into another thing that's important for you if you are going to start coding is going to be the laptop keyboards so off the batman laptop keyboards are really really important because of the fact that you're going to be typing all day and so we got jim carrey here just you know snapping at the keys just clicking everything and honestly everybody has a different preference on keyboards right now and the thing about it is that you know there's keyboards that have no travel whatsoever to them like the butterfly keyboard on the mac on the macbook um computers or laptops or whatever but they recently changed them i believe in 2020 they believed they changed the butterfly keyboard because it had no travel that was pretty insane i didn't like it i used to have that laptop i didn't like it so this is you know an example of other hard other laptops keyboards and this is what i'm talking about with the butterfly keyboard so butterfly keyboard had no travel the thing about this is that you're typing you want to make sure that you're typing on the actual button and sometimes with some keyboards it feels like you're not typing into anything it's a little bit insane so what are we going to do like if a little bit of debris goes in inside of the keyboard the key then you're gonna have to fix your whole keyboard again and that's pretty crazy so i mean it really doesn't make sense to me to be a programmer somebody that's typing all day and have these type of keyboards although i do love max and i i am very thankful for them that they actually just you know change the way that they they do their keyboards because of this specific thing this is a mechanical keyboard here a lot of people that love gaming specifically love mechanical keyboards i like them but they make so much noise i think it's annoying you know some people i think it's a little bit pretentious too like some people just go like crazy like it's like bro just chill just kind of just type you know beautifully like uh you know like a butterfly sting like a bee muhammad ali but that's kind of what i think about keyboards to be honest with you and mechanical keyboards are king logan says hell yeah man i mean i kind of like them i honestly like them more than how they specifically function they're pretty cool in my opinion but i hate the sounds that come with them i don't like them so one of the important things off the bat that i feel are going to be the most important things whether you use keyboards or not is going to be in the actual programming on your computers is going to be the operating system so off the batman there's three main operating systems right now in the market and it's very important for you to know which one you're going to use so for example like i said in the beginning of my slides i said that you know whether you want to make swift apps or you want to make you know android apps or you want to use unity or you want to use xcode or you want to use you know all of these different types of ids they're going to require for you to have different systems if you want to do apple product you know software then you're going to have to use apple and there's no other way around it i guess you can use you know virtual machines on windows or unix using apple but i wouldn't recommend that just because it's way way slower but you know off the batman the the we are very kind of biased in the fact that i think mac is pretty much might be the best laptop for programming in 2020 not just because of its amazing build and the way that it just moves it's so fast even if you have eight gigabyte ram and if you have 16 gigabytes you're all set but if you have 32 gigabytes of ram on your macbook that's insane bro you're set for a few years for now and what i do want to say is that i mean one of the biggest problems that people have with macbooks is going to be the price so if price is not a concern for you mac is the way to go and i'll go deeper into that in a few of my other slides but i know for a fact that windows gives you more bang for your buck and i grew up using windows i used to fix windows computers i think it's so awesome that they have most of their software is free there's so many options of software you can also do gaming really really comfortably and it's going to be you know really cool for you to to be able to choose whether you want mac or windows all of them are great the cool thing about this is that i'd say if you don't have the money for mac then go into windows and use a dual boot between windows and linux ubuntu because right now linux is really cool like logan is saying he says linux is wicked cool everything free and fast yes it's really cool but at the same time it's super duper duper limited i mean have you guys ever used an ubuntu operating system it's cool it looks beautiful it's so customizable but really bro like how many customizations are you gonna do to it it's awesome but you can't even download you know basic things like vlc like vlc player and other or i don't know if vlc is now for you for unix for linux sorry but my point is that there's so little software for unix and if that's your primary machine then you're just going to be so limited not only as a developer but as a human so don't go into that route of just using ubuntu trying to be a hipster just because you think that nobody uses it i mean honestly i'd say use windows if you're gonna have that and then download ubuntu as a dual boot you know software so off the bat here we go with the first actual recommendation that i will give you guys for these laptops i think the dell xps if you're using windows is a great great laptop and people have gone crazy with it just because it's a great laptop for gaming it's uh one of dell's you know flagship products it's been going it's been you know delivering these specific series for i think like since 2010 or 13 it's beautiful because it's very lightweight all dell computers in my opinion have very good um very good build and they also last a few years but what i do want to say is that you know now more than ever their screens are starting to become really good and that's something that i like about mac is that their screens are very good you know coming up with a retina display in 2015 it just kind of changed the game man so off the bat dell xps i'm saying bro if you use windows get try to get at least 16 gigabytes of ram don't try to use or get you know freaking let me see if i can pull this up here if i can let's see screen brush here we go so in my opinion guys i mean if you are using dell and windows have a 16 gigabytes 16 gig gigabytes of ram okay and if you can't do that then at least do 8 gigabytes of ram so i mean you're not spending that much money i think that's going to be very important right now i believe that i7 processors give me one minute here guys let me bust out of here go deep into this again and actually let me see cool so awesome there we go so if you are using this dell as your thing then you're going to want to get 60 gigabytes of ram and then you're going to want to get at least an i7 processor if you're using if you're using intel but if you're using amd then i'd say get at least a quad core quadcore processor or maybe even a six core six core and i'd say that the specifications as long as they're higher than 2.0 2.0 gigahertz on the processor then you're good so this is going to be kind of my recommendation for you guys if you guys you know are going to use windows i believe 16 gigabytes is the way to go an i7 maybe even a 99 i9 is going to be better for you and then if you're using amd then get a quad core or get a 6 core with amd's i don't remember what they're called but all of them should be at least higher than 2.0 gigahertz per second so that's my recommendation with the dell xps i believe it's a great computer and now going up to the runnerups let's see what's next so let me get out of there here we go we got the microsoft surface it's not the three let's actually switch that now it's not the three because right now we're at you know model seven but microsoft surface edition is a really really good microsoft uh alternative for programming just because they try to get that feel of you know the macbooks but the cool thing about this is that it's a two in one computer so that's pretty freaking awesome guys and the cool thing about microsoft surface is that you can either use it with the keyboard or not i mean obviously if your programming you might want to use it with a keyboard it's going to be hard for you to type on the screen but it's cool to know that you have at least that option but the cool thing about microsoft surface is that it doesn't require anything too fancy and yet it's a really fast computer and you can do very lightweight you know things with it as in you can emit weight things with it because it doesn't have an integrated video card i think some do the pros too i believe but even then they're very limited i don't see any of these having a four gigabyte you know video card and even though that might not be so important for your programming i think it's important for the way that you use computers so if you're programming you're going to be doing other things in the background that are going to affect your code it's not just about where the code runs i know that you know video cards are very important for you if you're doing deep learning but at the same time they're they're important for everything so and something that i say is if you can pretty much edit a video on a computer you can pretty much code with it really well most of the time at least so that's a good one so you guys know that razer has been going crazy on the laptop game on these last years people you know are going to razer as one of the the biggest like the best flagship products for windows just because of their build quality and it's something that windows was missing from its market so i'm glad the razer was able to actually bring it here for you guys and so let me see what what other things do i want to mention about razer it is good for gaming and another awesome thing about it is that it's very lightweight so you can carry it around everywhere the 15inch model is my favorite in my opinion i think they even have the 14 inch models but i mean from 14 to 15 just get 15 guys come on i think the bigger screen for you guys are get is going to be the most important just because you're looking at code every single day guys so here too you know if i was getting a razor i try to say at least 16 gigabytes ram let's let's do that so it stays 16 gigabytes ram at least a two gigabyte two gigabyte dc video card two gigabyte video card and then an i7 processor so we got this and obviously you need that ssd so i would say get an ssd of 500 gigabytes so guys you are going you know you are going the windows route it might not be that that expensive for you guys but if you're doing this on a mac this this would probably cost you around two to three k to get on a mac but if you're doing it on the windows it might just cost you even 800 bucks or less so that's the cool thing about going into windows you can actually do this for the for your budget you know so those are great builds i think it's it's not bad if you choose them i just want to mention that there's going to be a few things and i'm going to mention it on the other slides if you do use windows you're going to be very very limited but other than that i feel like it's a great you know type of alternative if you don't have the money for a macbook pro so you know going a little bit deeper into everything else we can do i feel like and give me one second here guys i wanna get out of this and then start moving this an hp spectre is gonna be another good good option for you i know the hp spectre has been on going on for a few years now probably about four or five years and it's it's kind of like the razer of hp so they went deep into the build quality they have amazing you know keyboards i really like them the screens is something that i want to emphasize you guys are looking at code every day so make sure that you're able to see the most amount of code on that screen so that's why i say choose the 15 inch also make sure to get very good um screen to pixel ratio i don't remember what what it's called specifically but make sure that your screen it has very good legibility so you can actually read from it okay so a lot of windows computers i can see a lot of pixels in them even to this date they're trying to you know maybe skip this skim themselves out a little bit on the actual screen but i feel like that just changes the whole experience of that computer so hp spectre is going to be a good other option and in my opinion i i was going to add the pixel book but i decided to add this instead just because i think it's a little bit more of a powerhouse it's been proven through time i'd say still get at least eight gigabytes to 16 gigabytes on the hp spectre 16 gigabytes to be honest if you can get that ssd the i7 processor or i9 nowadays and please you know don't in my opinion if this is your build uh and you're using a windows let's say you have an i3 processor let's actually open it up so let's say you have an i let's say i 3 processor and you have a 250 gigabyte and then it's going to be a hard drive not even not not even a not even a what's it called an ssd it's a hard drive you got this this and then let's say you got six gigabytes of ram this is actually a pretty normal build for very economic computers i'd say so most people that end up you know buying their first computer they have something similar to this they have in either i3 or a dual core dual core with amd amd right so i3 or dual core with amd uh 250 gigabytes or 500 gigabytes hard drive not an ssd then six gigabytes of ram if you have this type of build for your computer you're gonna run into a lot of problems so at least i'd say try to get an i i five let me actually leave it on screen so damn it let me see okay there we go i clicked it again but there we go so i i5 and then get maybe a 250 gigabyte you know ssd and then get at least eight gigabytes of ram and this is my example for low budget computers so if you have this at least you're not going to be that bad and if you can get a video card of at least 1.5 gigabytes of video card i think you're set if you have this this is pretty decent you might not need anything else if you're doing very lightweight tasks like maybe using visual studio code running javascript or something like that i think this is okay but this is for the low budget built i would not really recommend this if you can go maybe i7 i89 500 gigabytes ssd and then 16 gigabytes of ram with a 2 gigabytes plus video card of ram so that would be my example another good one is the zen book zen book is awesome they're coming up with different styles nowadays for all of these you know years it's been kind of crazy i like their build quality it's amazing i also like the keyboards how they have them i mean i think it's it kind of sucks that i don't have every computer here with me so that you guys can actually check it out but i think that would be actually really dope but asus is really cool because they used to make motherboards they were kind of like on the background making motherboards but now they're using computers that look very aesthetically pleasing and are actually very reliable the cool thing about them is that they're actually very fast so i'd say the same thing 16 gigabytes ram minimum with at least two gigabytes of video card you know memory and i think that would be a great option for it but now we're gonna we're gonna show you guys the macbook pro 16 inches within in my opinion it's going to be the best laptop for you to use in programming hands down hands down i think it even deserves a freaking so you know i feel like this computer right now is a great computer because one i love that they added the escape button because i hated the fact that the bar was just so touch you know what i mean like it was just touch it was just like kind of if you're using your phone but it felt kind of like so less somebody's saying windows 12 is best i'm gonna block you guys if you guys keep on just repeating something you know please keep it clean we're all trying to learn here and talking about macbook pro man macbooks are insane in my opinion i like i said i was using windows my whole life let's actually take this off i was using windows my whole life but then decided to go into mac and it really did change everything and if you're using a mac surprisingly you might need a little bit less specs to run your code because mac is actually very fast it's clean the way that it runs so in my opinion if you're using i mean the macbook pro i'll go deeper into what what you should run with it i think you know at least 16 to 32 gigabytes of ram would be insane let's let's actually go into that a little bit faster so 16 gigabytes of ram for this one 232 gigabytes i'm using right now the 32 gigabytes one and it's amazing guys and also at least 2.5 if you can gigabytes of video card so this one has intel video cards with amd video card put together so intel graphics integrated with uh it's i think it's 1.5 gigabytes of integrated video graphics of intel and then a 1.5 or 2.5 of amd video card uh and this is a dedicated video card and this is going to be important important for your build like right now you know most of the time we're coding and we're actually building stuff but at the same time we're also live streaming with you guys so we need machines that can withstand that amount of power to do this and this one has an i9 processor so i believe this is this is either a six core and eight core processor but it's amazing and then it obviously has an ssd of one terabyte you can get it two terabytes whatever i mean after one terabyte i think you're pretty much good so this is pretty much i think in my opinion the perfect perfect model that you can use for you know the specs that you can use for your macbook if you're using a macbook because in my opinion like i said macbooks are the best laptops for programming hands down just because it's gonna make everything so so much less complicated and so you know i'll give you guys this is an example of one that you can build very well and would actually stand the test of time you can probably have this for at least three even maybe even four years actually if you have this type of build 16 gigabytes it's a little bit outdated in my opinion you should be going to 32 already because 16 is kind of like i think i think it's fine to be honest with you i think it's fine you're probably not going to need anything more than that but if you want that's probably going to last you maybe like two more years or something like that in my opinion but let's say you have a little bit less money and you still want to you know use the macbook i'd say a good build for macbooks would be maybe you know the eight gigabyte let me actually keep it there so eight gigabytes with a laptop with a macbook sorry and run maybe an i5 processor i think that's good and then also the video card for it to be 1.5 and i even think that's a little bit small video card a dedicated video card okay not an integrated video card you know if you have a macbook air macbook airs do have integrated cards which is not the same integrated graphics it's not the same as a dedicated video card so eight gigabytes this this i would still suggest an ssd so i'd say 500 gigabyte ssd so if you have this or if you have an i7 i believe this build for max is gonna be insane for you it's gonna be really really good so if you're coming from windows and and you're like damn i really wanna code in mac what do i wanna do mac also have heating issues no they don't max don't really have heating issues man if you're building your own pcs that's when you're going to have a lot of heating issues raul mandal says that and no bro you know if you're most most desktops have bad heating issues if you're using a windows desktop that you built if you're using a mac heating issues are even getting better in in the 2013 to 2015 models or 2012 to 2015 models the fan would get on would turn on really fast and try to you know it would make a lot of sound i didn't like it but after the 2016 model they started getting you know their heat maintained very very well so the fans on the 16 2016 up versions of the macbooks are insane they're really really good you know right now i'm using a macbook to run this whole live stream and it's pretty good it's very buttery so it's amazing and like i say this is the one that i would suggest if you have a budget for macbook so guys i know maybe macbooks might be expensive for you but at the same time guys you know save up some money i think a good good good way to buy a macbook would be buy a refurbished one so don't buy a new one buy a refurbished one you'll save yourself hundreds of dollars for the same thing you'll also you can also buy used ones so if you don't buy a refurbished one buy a used mac and that's gonna be better for you than some other windows products and that's not me hitting on windows that's literally just my experience i love windows computers especially for gaming man but if you're trying to code if you're trying to do something sleek with with your time and also your code then go with those specific things on the macbook and like i said macbook in my opinion would be the best bet as computer as a laptop to use for programming but let's say that you weren't able to have a macbook for whatever reason then for you your best bet would be definitely use a windows computer but use ubuntu as a dual boot okay a dual boot so what you're gonna do is you're gonna buy a windows pc because they normally don't sell ubuntu pcs ubuntu is a type of it's a version of using linux right so so what's cool about this is that you can have your windows pc you can buy you know the whole setup with windows even build your own pc and ubuntu is free so just install it as a dual boot in your computer you can have best of both worlds and once you start you know coding you can just use ubuntu but once you're using your computers like normal then you just use windows and that's totally fine too i've had experience doing that running it myself it's actually really enjoyable i like it man i like ubuntu a little bit but like i said it's very very limited in terms of the software that it provides for the users and so that's why i wouldn't use it in the long term but at the same time i mean i know that a lot of companies use ubuntu as their go to you know os and they actually use them on virtual machines so they have it on windows but they run it on virtual machine instead of windows which literally just means that you're running an operating system instead of another operating system and that's okay but i'd say use the dual boot option with ubuntu and windows and here i kind of i just put pixel versus surface versus then it's a macbook my opinion i just like this photo i mean i didn't put the pixel i was going to put it but then i decided to put the hp spectre using all of these this is the the surface book in my opinion between these three the macbook is just the winner you know without a single doubt in my mind the macbook is just the winner i mean whatever you want to say man like at the end of the day it's all about efficiency reliability and quality in my opinion so you know if you're gonna get better overall in almost everything just invest a little bit more money into the macbook pro and i wouldn't suggest the macbook air just because i don't like the fact that it doesn't have that it doesn't have dedicated graphics it has integrated graphics and that's going to slow down the way that you use your computer a lot even if you're just using chrome or doing something very very you know not as demanding as as maybe i don't know running a high definition video or something like that so one of the biggest important things about mac is that you know i do want to explain about the display differences in mac so after the retina the retina display came out right in the display came out i think in 2015 with that was the first model man it just changed completely everything it's like you can see things in 1080p that and this is this is how it looked like the size that it would look like the screen resolution how it would look like and then the retina display just makes it so much crispier now you don't have to see the pixels on each text so this text rendering on screens on mac is just amazing and that's a huge part of coding definitely so you know one of the biggest things about it is that you're going to be looking at text your whole freaking day so you don't want to be looking at text that looks very pixely it's going to hurt your eyes plus it's going to be harder for you to read plus then all of that gets compounded and you're spending more time looking at code more time thinking about things you have less energy it all compounds and makes it harder for you to keep using that computer and i i know for a fact from my own experience i was using this hp what was it it was an hp envy computer very recently that was another that was another one of the options that i thought of putting in here but i decided not to just because i thought it was like way too economic and you guys can you know using what i just taught you guys about what i think a decent build would be for computers but in my opinion you know most of those screens just look a little bit like this and i cannot stare at them for long periods of time so one of the biggest things about the macbook is the fact that you know everything is so much easier on macbook you're not going to be able to follow you know some tutorials that you see on the web another thing is that the command line with macbook is using unix and windows is not using unix i believe they said that they had now bash in the new windows but at the same time it's not the same as using this specific command line so here i put a little part of an article it says macs run fulltime on unixbased operating system and they are thus more developer friendly this explains why macs are the way to go for many developers with the unixbased command line programming is easier as you're able to run programs in almost any language so you can just install python like nothing on mac and it's gonna be very very hard for you to do that on another programming language i mean sorry another operating system and man it's just gonna save you so much time let's say you're following somebody else's tutorials let's say you're in school and you don't wanna spend so much time setting things up mac is gonna be the way to go another thing is that unix is also more secure by default compared to windows this is the reason why mags tend to be safer against the tools that hackers use such as malwares trojan horses and viruses and the reason because the reason why that is is because most of the people in the world use windows so there's a bigger pool of people using windows so obviously if you're a hacker then you know you're going to want to target windows because so many more people use windows and mac and because of that reason there's more malicious softwares and hackers in these platforms such as windows and ubuntu well i mean nobody has that so nobody wants to target that to be honest with you or unix i mean or linux is nobody's going to want to target that because nobody really uses linux and linux sorry so that's a little bit about that but in my opinion i mean if you're into cyber security if you're into those type of you know professions then i'd say use windows because that's probably the command line that you're going to be using that's really why people want to you know hire you so that you can either develop antivirus software or just you know anti antimalicious software or just protocols and things like that so if you're having any of those type of careers then i'd say use windows but if not if you're just doing software development use macs and this is kind of just you know the the command line on mac right now so let's see what you guys are saying at least the macbook pro yep so which os is most used in it professional work nicoon asks and so in it in my opinion the most use is going to be windows there's a lot of softwares like wireshark that you would use on windows i think it's it's also on mac but everything is done on windows man because you're trying to you know work with networks and windows has a very good um you know latch on that they can actually work very well with with specific you know software i mean um network type of of work so like i said if you guys are following any tutorial this is an example of an xcode tutorial that somebody's following and they're making an app here off the bat to begin with you guys are just going to see so many more lines of code even if you're using you know mac versus windows because the way that they the way that they you know tend to have their screen resolution is just gonna be a little bit bigger their screens have better quality and the 16 by nine ratio is really really nice on these but the fact that you can look at these words without them being very pixel it's going to be great for you plus the the whole development environment is going to be insane on the macbook pro just because like i said python can run on it like nothing almost by default and other things like just installing for example visual studio code your developer environment is going to be way way easier to have it set up there in windows you have to move all these knobs all these things like you have to download so many packages for you it's always telling you to get updated then you got to make sure that your drivers are on point and you got to make sure that you know it's so many things and then mac makes it so easy for you to just be ready with everything so macbook pro is going to be the way to go if you do have the money for that if you don't like i said use windows with ubuntu as dual boot but you know in conclusion guys like you guys might have seen right now because i just clicked it we got to this little monkey right here and this is how you don't want to feel when choosing your laptop for programming in 2020 guys just because of the fact that like i said guys it's going to take us all the way to the to the beginning obviously think about your endpoint what do you want to do with programming if you're going to be doing software for macs then you're going to need a mac computer if you're going to do other things that don't require anything related to the macbook developer environment then you can use windows but think about it as well so then be like okay so what's the budget that i want to think of if you're trying to do 800 giga 800 or less with a budget i'd say try to get an ssd and try to make it eight gigabytes of ram at least if you can do a little bit more of money than that then i'd say you know obviously get the 16 gigabytes ram get the 500 gigabyte ssd and try to get a dedicated video card don't be using integrated video cards not only because maybe the code doesn't use the video card the fact of the matter the fact is gonna be that you're gonna be doing other things on your computer while doing the code so you don't wanna limit yourself just by thinking like oh i'm gonna use my whole computer for code nope everything like really affects the way that you code so you know let's say you're doing a design on the other screen then you're gonna want a computer that has very good screens so that you can see the pixels and actually see the spacing make sure the proportions are good all of these things are going to be part of this so off the back guys i do want to say thank you so much like i said macbook pro would be the best and ideal way to go if you want to get a really killer computer in 2024 programming specifically it's going to be easier for you to set up your your developer environment it's going to be easier for you to see on the screen just because of the good screen ratio that it has the 16 by nine ratio together with the great quality displays that mac has for you guys whether that's the retina display or even the newer lcd displays that they're doing they have really good backlight another thing is going to be their keyboards they used to have the butterfly keyboard it's not that great in my opinion but now after the 2020 model and i believe the 2019 16 inch one then the keyboard started to be very very decent so that's going to be awesome so remember guys that if you can do 16 gigabytes ram at least on ram because it's gonna affect the way that you move around your computer eight gigabytes for a mac is okay but i'd say still you know push to get the 16 gigabytes also another thing i want to mention is the fact that you know command line on mac is like i said unix based and not and windows is not so that's going to save you a lot of time in running your apps pushing them to github all of these things and like i mentioned the quality and then just following the tutorials it's going to be so much more easier for you to pick up a language if you can just really forget about everything that is around you and you just don't have to worry about the environment of your of your programming that much you know you don't have to worry about downloading a bunch of packages for you to start coding if you can just do it pretty much out of the box then your skill set is just going to go from here to here that much more faster so make sure to not only invest in you know maybe how you think a machine will will end up you know costing and how much you're going to be using it think about the fact of the quality of the everyday usage of it so you know maybe you're gonna be thinking like oh damn like i want to save a little bit of money but at the same time i'm losing a lot of time because i cannot even read the code on my screen so don't think like that guys you know really make an investment a laptop is a really great investment if you're doing programming it's going to be one of your most important investments so make sure that not only do you get a computer that can actually run your code very well but it helps you do other things on the site like watch videos look at designs because in videos you're going to see tutorials because in designs it's going to help you build your projects and then render projects you know maybe even push projects to to a git repository or anything like that so all of those things are going to be part that make up the requirements for your computer but like i said guys those pretty much are the things that i would recommend for you guys you guys can get anything you want but macbook pro is going to be the best bet the best bang for your buck ultimately for most development you know environments careers and things of the sort so with that said guys you know if you guys are really enjoying this content if you guys want to keep up to date with what we're putting out on the daily because it is really fire content we're making a bunch of clones whether that's you know the hula clone youtube clone tinder clones all of these clones we're putting them together for you guys in the next weeks we're gonna actually drop a react video and you guys should very much stay tuned for it and also if you guys are enjoying this type of content and you want to learn a little bit more about how to become a profitable javascript developer go into our free training down below on the description and you're going to see that we have a webinar for you that kazi did with a lot of a lot of love and it's going to teach you exactly how to start from the beginning to become a profitable javascript developer and also you know check out profit with javascript as well if you guys want to do the same thing this is our course our flagship course that teaches you just that so with that said guys it was a pleasure to be with you guys uh the first thing got actually cut off so i'm gonna put together the video so you guys can actually see it in one specific take so i do apologize because of that we got a bunch of technical issues some days some days it's perfect but with that said macbook pro number one as the best laptop for programming in 2020 other than that there's a few other options that i listed for you guys and make sure to check out those specs that i'm telling you make them the minimum that you can get and if you can invest a little bit more money do it it's going to be very very worth it all right guys this was frankie for y'all take it easy much love peace bye
