00:00 - sup guys this is konzi here from clever
00:02 - programmer calm I'm here with Erin and
00:05 - today we got a lot of cool stuff for you
00:07 - so why is Python
00:10 - beating out JavaScript when it comes to
00:13 - Google Trends we're gonna be talking
00:15 - about that and we're gonna be talking
00:16 - about quite a few things as you can see
00:19 - here we've got some jokes for you today
00:20 - we got what can you do with Python and
00:22 - we'll also be doing a lot of Q&A because
00:24 - this is live to keep dropping your
00:26 - questions we'll take some in the start
00:28 - some in the middle some at the end at
00:30 - the end for sure so without any further
00:33 - ado what do you say iron shall we jump
00:36 - right into it music here we go so as you
00:49 - can see over here JavaScript and Python
00:51 - programming languages from 2004 to
00:54 - present right now right what do we have
00:57 - over here javascript was super popular
00:59 - highly highly searched and it still is
01:02 - popular don't get me wrong but as you
01:04 - sort of see this line like a snake that
01:06 - Python is around 2017 right around 2016
01:11 - and 2017 right when I our channel
01:14 - started growing right it started beating
01:17 - out job JavaScript and in terms of its
01:22 - interest rate on Google Trends it's
01:24 - actually beat it out okay and we'll turn
01:30 - off the music now and actually in stack
01:33 - overflow job Python is actually the
01:36 - number one now most questioned language
01:40 - the language that asking the most
01:42 - questions for Python yep which shows
01:45 - which tells me that the trend for this
01:48 - language is actually really really
01:49 - really high okay we have some people
01:53 - jumping in
01:54 - what is up gene my man what's going on
01:59 - what is up jinsa what is up spider
02:03 - what is up Hudson what is up who saw how
02:06 - is it going okay so now we're gonna jump
02:10 - into our next segment which is
02:13 - this is a great blog post that I was
02:15 - going through by promote and it's a
02:17 - Python or JavaScript which one should I
02:19 - choose and you know the TLDR
02:22 - are both are really good but we're gonna
02:24 - talk a little bit about things that
02:26 - people kind of overlook and don't talk
02:28 - as much about okay so first of all we're
02:31 - not we're not gonna go through every
02:32 - single one of these but some of these I
02:34 - definitely want to hit on so let's talk
02:36 - about the ease of use and the beginner
02:39 - how friendly something is right so when
02:45 - it comes to when it comes to the ease of
02:47 - use and how friendly something is Python
02:51 - you have JavaScript and then you have
02:53 - Python and I think in my opinion Python
02:56 - is much more beginner friendly and the
03:00 - reason for that is you don't have to
03:01 - deal with the complexity of things being
03:03 - online things are hard enough already
03:05 - when you're coding as a beginner to deal
03:08 - with the complexity of the online it
03:10 - gets even more difficult and here is
03:15 - something that we prepared for you to
03:19 - show you right I have a new framework
03:24 - down here Johnny
03:26 - and then everybody JavaScript developer
03:29 - ever jumps down there okay that is one
03:33 - example of why JavaScript is super
03:36 - complicated here's another example of
03:39 - why JavaScript might be a little bit
03:41 - complicated okay hopefully our buttons
03:45 - work there we go cool sometimes when
03:48 - programming in JavaScript I just want to
03:50 - yell this but I can't remember what
03:54 - this refers to so the object-oriented
03:59 - portion of JavaScript is also a little
04:02 - bit confusing and then the new things
04:04 - that introduce with each new launch of
04:06 - es6 it only gets more and more complex
04:10 - so if you are a beginner or even
04:12 - intermediate or even advanced you
04:15 - constantly have to keep learning new
04:16 - things right which is which is what most
04:18 - developers should do but if you're a
04:21 - beginner intermediate it can really hurt
04:23 - your learning
04:25 - okay then we get into versatility and
04:29 - uncertain one of these right so for
04:30 - example with versatility they're both
04:32 - pretty good when it comes to web
04:34 - development or you have enterprise when
04:37 - you have versatility right here right
04:39 - when you have web development or
04:40 - Enterprise development or when it comes
04:43 - to machine learning and data science
04:45 - JavaScript and Python blows goal kind of
04:48 - hand-in-hand they got the they both do a
04:50 - little bit of a combat here right but
04:52 - when it comes to machine learning and
04:55 - data science Java Python is definitely
04:58 - taking the cake and with most things
05:01 - going to machine learning and a lot of
05:03 - things going to data science it's very
05:06 - important to catch the trends while
05:10 - they're happening because the people
05:12 - like Columbus are probably not Columbus
05:15 - but people who discovered the transfers
05:18 - are usually the people who are on the
05:20 - winning side if you got into blockchain
05:24 - or I'm sorry Bitcoin very early on which
05:28 - I did but my family freaked out
05:31 - otherwise we would have been
05:32 - millionaires right now which would have
05:34 - been really cool but if you got into
05:38 - Bitcoin early on you would make a lot of
05:41 - money shit-ton right yeah if you got
05:44 - into Apple stock early or something like
05:45 - that when it was little yeah
05:51 - fidget spinners yeah jump on that leg
05:55 - right away right need a lot of money and
05:57 - not everybody just like lagging behind
05:58 - those spinners the dropshipping on
06:04 - fidget spinner was probably really hot
06:05 - too so if you catch on to these trends
06:09 - when they're happening and you catch
06:11 - that wave it's really really powerful
06:14 - for example there's an article by Forbes
06:16 - that talks about 800 million jobs right
06:21 - let me go see if I can find it drop in
06:23 - the Forbes 30 ok so let's see over here
06:26 - so this article actually talks about how
06:30 - what kind of ad is that
06:32 - music yeah no no no cuz I'm pretty good
06:35 - I want to look at that a new study by
06:39 - McKinsey Global Institute estimates that
06:41 - between 400 million and 800 million of
06:45 - today's jobs will be automated by 2030
06:49 - and which means that a lot of jobs are
06:52 - gonna be automated by a machine a lot of
06:54 - things that people are doing manual
06:56 - labor for currently ok so check out
07:00 - services like scan and go already in
07:02 - Walmart it's like replacing it cashiers
07:05 - are going on a business right apparently
07:07 - helicopter helicopter drivers not - oh
07:09 - yeah drivers are going out of business
07:12 - right lyft and uber are already like
07:14 - doing self-driving cars and so uber
07:18 - copters are going to be coming out maybe
07:20 - they're gonna be self-driving too and so
07:22 - the things that are doing data science
07:23 - and machine learning which are gonna be
07:25 - super hot those are gonna be the things
07:27 - that are gonna have the trend and one of
07:30 - the reasons we believe Python is going
07:32 - really really far in this is because
07:34 - precisely because of its capability to
07:38 - do machine learning and data science so
07:41 - let's go forward into our beautiful
07:44 - graphs that beautiful pictures that we
07:46 - have here prepared for you guys learning
07:50 - C in college never gonna move oh cool I
07:54 - want to give a shout out to all types of
07:57 - Najma who was on my Instagram and she
08:01 - did an internship in Chicago also this
08:06 - is what she did was super cool she
08:08 - joined one of my courses called Python
08:10 - oo Pete recently and while she was
08:13 - actually driving
08:15 - she was coding and then she sent me the
08:18 - screenshot of going through the course
08:20 - so we thought that was pretty
08:21 - awesome because what is your Excuse now
08:26 - - not code right it can be driving and
08:29 - coding at the same time let's keep going
08:33 - through much support my bro hey William
08:37 - Kirk what is going on Darrell guys keep
08:39 - asking your questions we're gonna be
08:40 - taking their questions at the end and
08:42 - answering them at the same time so
08:43 - Hudson we're gonna take your question
08:44 - right
08:45 - second okay and what I'm gonna do is I'm
08:47 - gonna bring your question in so
08:48 - everybody else can see it as well all
08:51 - right here we go
08:52 - hey why they're always keen on money's
08:55 - are trying people to learn some
08:56 - programming language I think he's
08:58 - talking about us Aaron I think so too it
09:01 - I think he's insulting I think he's
09:03 - pointing fingers pointing fingers
09:06 - pointing fingers man why they always
09:08 - keen on money to attract people to learn
09:11 - some programs yeah well because you know
09:17 - you know money is cool man money is kind
09:19 - of important look at what - yeah look at
09:21 - languages that don't make any money you
09:24 - can do that too if you want how can I
09:27 - get a remote job with Python is a
09:29 - back-end developer so what I recommend
09:31 - is to go on up work and to actually
09:34 - apply to places that like literally
09:39 - start finding jobs related to Python
09:42 - whether they're a back-end or front-end
09:44 - or whatever end right need quick help
09:46 - with a Django project there's a user and
09:49 - product model in my jingle there's your
09:51 - back-end job I found you your
09:53 - back-end job here it is 14 minutes ago
09:55 - entry-level right talk at the top this
09:58 - is it this is your job go and apply for
10:00 - it right now okay this guy needs some
10:02 - basic stuff user and a product model
10:05 - this is how you start applying to jobs
10:07 - to keep building that experience and
10:09 - then you can go for sure this is a 30
10:11 - minute job but if you keep applying and
10:13 - landing these you're gonna be doing the
10:14 - much bigger jobs that are available here
10:17 - on up work check this out it says I need
10:19 - someone who is available to start right
10:20 - now and finish it within the next one to
10:22 - two hours there you go do it now go
10:25 - literally do it right now yeah okay so
10:28 - there you go man I always have such an
10:30 - easy time finding these guys a back-end
10:33 - question boom found is a back-end answer
10:35 - yeah there you go you just got back
10:38 - ended okay so hopefully that answers
10:43 - your question excuses are pushing you
10:45 - back that is correct
10:47 - always how many days can I become a full
10:49 - stack developer please reply it depends
10:52 - on the amount of hours you code if you
10:54 - code between hundred thousand hours
10:56 - that's pretty decent amount of hours to
10:59 - become a full stack developer and to be
11:01 - able to get these jobs the one I just
11:02 - showed on up work for example is a very
11:05 - possible job that you can do within one
11:08 - month of learning Python and Django
11:10 - literally one month you can make a first
11:13 - 30 dollars from coding you make your
11:15 - first 30 dollars then you can make you
11:16 - 100 first hundred dollars from coding
11:17 - with Python you can make your first
11:19 - thousand dollars and make your first ten
11:21 - thousand dollars and maybe being on your
11:24 - way to making 10 20 30 40 thousand
11:26 - dollars that year from just coding from
11:30 - these side projects ok so it really
11:33 - depends first of all how many hours you
11:35 - put in what made it easy for me to code
11:37 - and learn was I was putting in about 15
11:39 - to 18 hours a day the more time you put
11:41 - in upfront the more days you'll save
11:43 - from the back end can Julia replace
11:49 - Python what is Julia I'll have to look
11:53 - it up it's a machine learning thing I
11:55 - think crashing into everything coding
11:58 - Waialae driving no she was not driving
12:02 - Mark Austin she was a passenger there's
12:05 - always somebody who's like bringing that
12:07 - up or any coding while you're driving
12:09 - why are you listening to audible while
12:11 - driving you can crash a car I'm pretty
12:15 - young but I could still do any projects
12:17 - Python good job jinsa amalah eyah
12:21 - hey Malaya thank you love you too my
12:23 - friend
12:24 - programming wood project says javascript
12:27 - has front-end framework Python has no
12:29 - front-end framework sure so why don't
12:32 - you do what developer builds this thing
12:34 - and do Python and Django you get full
12:36 - back-end and then on top of that slap
12:39 - JavaScript so what I like to do is I
12:41 - like to do Python and Django and then
12:44 - using Django rest framework create a API
12:49 - and then just use JavaScript from there
12:51 - to do my front-end stuff so you can use
12:53 - view j/s if you wanted to you can use
12:55 - angular you can use react use use
12:57 - whatever you want but whichever part I
13:00 - can do it
13:00 - in Django I'll do because it just makes
13:02 - my life a lot easier okay please explain
13:07 - I don't understand it can we use
13:10 - JavaScript for mobile applications
13:12 - development what we recommend you do is
13:15 - actually look into flutter it's a thing
13:17 - made at language made by Google is being
13:19 - popularized and there are a lot of
13:21 - developers in demand for flutter and
13:24 - it's developed by Google okay flutter is
13:27 - developed by Google and another another
13:30 - great thing about flutter is that you
13:33 - can do it's one language Dart and it
13:36 - allows you to build applications for
13:38 - both iOS and Android so you don't need
13:42 - to learn Android development and then
13:43 - you don't need to learn to make an
13:45 - Android app and then you don't and then
13:46 - you don't have to learn iOS to make iOS
13:48 - app wow we're getting a lot of viewers
13:52 - this is amazing seventy-three concurrent
13:54 - viewers okay awesome guys we're gonna
13:58 - keep going with this okay so learn
14:01 - flutter flutter is gonna be unbelievable
14:04 - for you movie when it comes to
14:06 - development and we'll make a clever
14:08 - programmer app and share it with you
14:10 - guys that's gonna be really exciting
14:12 - okay can I start learning Python as an
14:16 - absolute beginner from code Academy and
14:18 - YouTube that is a great question in the
14:20 - description below I have my free
14:23 - five-day Python course if you put in
14:27 - your thing click it and put in your
14:29 - email so for example I'll show you okay
14:32 - clever programmer dot-com slash learn
14:36 - Python if you go here and you put in
14:41 - your name like this and you put in your
14:43 - email address like this and you hit free
14:47 - course it will give you a free Python
14:50 - course that's really really unbelievable
14:52 - that you're gonna enjoy you're gonna get
14:53 - massive value out of this has 40,000
14:56 - students I think at this point would
14:58 - probably have 80 to 90 plus thousand
15:01 - students who have gone through our free
15:03 - course for Python so definitely go ahead
15:08 - and you in the description below
15:10 - weathering on Facebook or YouTube and
15:12 - sign up
15:13 - for that let's go back here we go cool
15:22 - what else is kind of it's Python simple
15:25 - enough to make a side hustle what do you
15:27 - say my friend come on
15:28 - spit some truth yes yes it is bottle
15:34 - okay I get simple can be okay talk to
15:37 - you talk to us like yes Python
15:39 - definitely cabbies the side hustle but
15:41 - not just because it's simple more just
15:43 - because it's powerful you can do a lot
15:45 - of stuff I mean like a lot of things are
15:47 - simple I don't know why I use that that
15:49 - word something doesn't have to be simple
15:50 - to be a side hustle that's why is it a
15:52 - that was a bit confused but Python
15:53 - definitely side hustle it's not the best
15:56 - phrased question I guess yeah I was
15:59 - confused I was like confused about how
16:01 - he was trying to ask but it's simple
16:03 - enough simple enough as in computer code
16:07 - 15 hours a day for three months but
16:11 - here's what you should do right don't
16:14 - just randomly code if you want to
16:15 - actually start getting freelancing job
16:18 - opportunities don't just start coding
16:21 - randomly here's what I recommend
16:24 - okay what did it go so go to jobs and
16:28 - type in Python and then learn specific
16:32 - skill sets that would is what I would
16:34 - recommend so there's a Django Chuck job
16:37 - available right this is the one we just
16:39 - looked at and this guy wants some basic
16:42 - models made and he needs to use a repo
16:46 - which requires you to learn git and
16:47 - github so I would say go ahead and this
16:51 - is an entry level so this means if you
16:54 - spent two weeks hardcore into learning
16:58 - Python and Django you will be able to
17:02 - get this job for $30 and actually put it
17:08 - on your portfolio that you actually
17:09 - helped somebody do a job and build out
17:11 - your profile on up work you will get a
17:13 - five-star rating you will get $30 and
17:16 - you are much more likely to then get a
17:19 - bigger job if you need to learn Django
17:22 - I'm making a bunch of stuff on it but
17:25 - you can do Python
17:26 - Django clever programmer and I have a
17:29 - lot of great stuff for Python Django
17:33 - yeah I have a series on this python
17:37 - tutorial 2018 for beginners and you can
17:40 - essentially go through this okay
17:42 - this is gonna help you with your denier
17:45 - go look up the jobs then go learn those
17:48 - skills and then go apply for those jobs
17:51 - okay and that way you are doing you are
17:55 - practicing the correct skills that are
17:59 - currently paying in the job market or
18:05 - you could go to college spend eight
18:07 - years learn a lot of theory and then you
18:10 - go to a job and they actually are doing
18:12 - none of that stuff and there's a new
18:14 - JavaScript framework that's actually
18:16 - doing what you need it to do right so
18:20 - you know don't do that don't become an
18:23 - irrelevant dinosaur because because you
18:27 - know that's what you feel like we makes
18:29 - that noise okay cool so let's hide my
18:34 - slideshow can't show all of it and let's
18:38 - go back okay the heat DBZ says I started
18:46 - learning how much would I have to scroll
18:49 - for this alright
18:53 - I started learning Python a month ago I
18:56 - recently graduated I'm I'm trying to see
18:58 - if I can find it no no hold on that'll
19:02 - be too much mijita Vegeta okay let's
19:07 - answer this one do I need a background
19:09 - in CS or a degree in computer science
19:11 - like a bachelor's undergrad to get an
19:14 - entry-level job that guy asked about
19:16 - back-end but in general to enter the
19:19 - field do I need to showcase projects or
19:22 - cut off cut off the answer is that it is
19:27 - not true anymore in today's world that
19:30 - you need a computer science degree to
19:34 - get a job especially to get an
19:36 - entry-level job okay it's
19:39 - that's not true anymore so I would not
19:43 - wreck
19:44 - if you want to go and learn theory or
19:46 - you have a very specific reason you want
19:48 - to become a doctor and you want to go to
19:50 - code like a coding school cool if you
19:53 - have extra money and you want to go to
19:54 - coding school cool but if you need to
19:56 - get jobs or you don't want to get
19:58 - freelancing work I don't think it's
20:00 - necessary no it definitely it gives you
20:04 - an edge a little bit I mean like they
20:06 - look you somebody who has a degree over
20:07 - somebody who doesn't but putting four
20:09 - years and all that money into a degree
20:11 - um I feel like you would get the same
20:14 - amount of edge in probably six months or
20:17 - less if you were smart about it like
20:19 - work on a lot of open source projects
20:21 - just find some open source projects on
20:22 - github and go work on them and get some
20:24 - experience because like even for me I
20:26 - already have a Bachelor ISM partway
20:29 - through my master's and no matter what
20:31 - like most positions they want you to
20:34 - have like years of experience was like
20:37 - Oh minimum two years middle and three
20:39 - years of experience before will even
20:40 - like consider hiring you which sucks
20:42 - because I only have like six or eight
20:44 - months of it and so it just wasn't
20:46 - enough
20:46 - but if you have enough like projects in
20:49 - your portfolio and things to back you up
20:52 - and you I guess you kind of say like
20:53 - working on open source project could be
20:54 - considered experience or if you have
20:56 - like some internships or something
20:57 - anything like that that will actually do
20:59 - much better than having a degree so if
21:01 - you can like get your chops up and then
21:02 - like leverage some connections you have
21:04 - ask some people maybe get like the
21:05 - internship try to something for free
21:08 - just to get your experience first that
21:10 - might actually help you a lot more
21:11 - getting an entry-level job than a than a
21:14 - degree would because they want to see
21:17 - what you have and they want experience
21:18 - and like having a degree late they kind
21:20 - of know it so it's not actual experience
21:22 - so if you can just shortcut that and
21:23 - just get some experience right off the
21:24 - bat that's I sure your best best bet
21:27 - kind of a catch-22 because you need
21:29 - experience to get experience but that's
21:31 - why I said you should try to get some
21:32 - free internships to work on some open
21:33 - source projects or something like that
21:34 - and I think that's actually a very very
21:36 - valid um plan of action to take and I
21:40 - kind of wish I did that I didn't know
21:41 - that I just kind of barley took the
21:43 - college route but yeah unless you want
21:46 - to go to something very very specific
21:47 - and be like eh
21:48 - academic in some topic then college is
21:52 - kind of all I feel like it's not worth
21:55 - four years for a degree right not worth
21:57 - four you know and the money you know and
22:00 - another thing is that you need to get
22:02 - smarter about how you're applying to all
22:04 - of these places so for example what I
22:06 - recommend is hit up start-up CEOs or
22:11 - people who are like have a startup and
22:13 - send them one-minute personalized video
22:16 - message that I will do the work I'll
22:18 - help you yeah send them a video message
22:20 - use something like drop ler or a service
22:23 - like use loom yeah okay even go to like
22:27 - just a random idea kind of generally
22:30 - related right you could go around to
22:31 - like small businesses and offer to make
22:33 - them websites for free and you can
22:34 - consider that actual experience she's
22:36 - put it on your resume be like oh yeah
22:38 - four six and then go from yeah go from
22:40 - free to actually start charging them be
22:42 - like hey look at what I can do for you
22:44 - give me a week give me a chance and then
22:46 - if you want to work with me cool but
22:48 - like literally send them a personal
22:49 - video screen recording like hey look
22:52 - this is your project it requires you to
22:54 - build this and this here's a blog post
22:57 - that I have built and using news loom
22:59 - you can actually screenshot or
23:01 - screencast what you are showing them on
23:04 - your screen and send a one-minute
23:06 - message right everybody you should apply
23:09 - to you should send them a personalized
23:11 - message and the more personal you can
23:13 - get with a video or with audio the more
23:16 - powerful your outreach is gonna be the
23:19 - more likely you are to actually speak
23:20 - with the person once you're face-to-face
23:22 - with a person your chances of landing
23:25 - that job go up by like 300% it's crazy
23:27 - so like a lot of those people were
23:28 - asking like oh we need three years of
23:30 - minimum experience but if I could if I
23:32 - could have just gotten in front of their
23:33 - faces it would have been a lot easier
23:35 - they could I could have been like
23:36 - I only have nine muscle experience but I
23:38 - did this this and this this is my skill
23:40 - set I feel like I'm a good fit here I
23:41 - provide this for the team blah blah blah
23:43 - and that'll actually do you much better
23:45 - because when you're just a resume in the
23:47 - stack if you have a degree in no
23:49 - experience you're not gonna get any more
23:50 - yeah well you need to like really use
23:53 - these soft skills to get in front of
23:54 - people and the best way to do that is
23:56 - actually just go go to places in person
23:57 - like literally like Netflix's across the
23:59 - street and down the street from us we
24:00 - can just walk right in and acts you know
24:03 - be like hey is there somebody out here I
24:04 - can talk to maybe I can work for free or
24:07 - looking for an internship or something
24:08 - like that and just kind of use these I
24:11 - mean like it might not work with Netflix
24:13 - girls are so big but who knows you might
24:14 - get lucky but smaller companies might be
24:16 - easier but the point is just keep trying
24:18 - until you get some experience and you
24:20 - get something you like yeah but Swedes
24:21 - so public tutorials a bit shaky actually
24:24 - says can you help me to point finger to
24:28 - the real life problem which uses machine
24:30 - learning and artificial intelligence so
24:33 - that is a great question here I have
24:37 - something for you guys let me let me
24:42 - show you what I got any Rick and Morty
24:46 - defense oh god I just
24:52 - there we go okay so here's you know you
24:55 - can do a lot with Python but there's
24:57 - something you can't still do with Python
24:59 - which is reversing the back reversing
25:02 - the digits of pi however loose carrion
25:05 - tried all right so let's go back it's
25:10 - pretty funny I guess I mean that what's
25:12 - the word because in the computer you
25:13 - can't have an infinite number so it
25:15 - would still print something so let me
25:16 - show you some examples some fun examples
25:18 - and they could eventually turn into be
25:21 - real life and having a camera that can
25:25 - detect people and what's happening here
25:28 - these machine learning algorithms you
25:30 - know they they have machine learning
25:31 - algorithms in cameras now where it can
25:34 - detect suspicious activity right so how
25:37 - insane is that
25:38 - that's real-world applications right but
25:42 - we got some more real-world applications
25:44 - for you right over here okay so here are
25:46 - some fun ones that we recently came
25:48 - across on reddit
25:49 - so this dude on the right hand side gave
25:52 - an image to the computer and with the
25:54 - Python code
25:56 - what Python did is on the left hand side
25:58 - drew that image using Microsoft Paint
26:01 - that's pretty cool
26:03 - okay next one this guy says he worked on
26:08 - this project and now his thing what it
26:11 - can do is they can do arrow and color
26:13 - detection at the right spot which can be
26:17 - implemented in self-driving Rover so
26:20 - here is an example of what this guy is
26:23 - talking about
26:26 - so look nothing red and then up red when
26:29 - he turns it to the right it goes right
26:31 - red and when he turns it to the left it
26:33 - goes left red how freaking sick is that
26:36 - right there's a lot you can do with
26:38 - Python now here's some other things that
26:43 - you can also do with Python these might
26:45 - be more obvious to you guys but this was
26:47 - cool to see that somebody did build this
26:49 - so somebody built a point-of-sale system
26:52 - in a store so if I go over here you have
26:55 - a point-of-sale system you guys are all
26:57 - familiar with this right nothing new
26:59 - here and look at this this is actually
27:01 - built using the tech inter module
27:04 - TK int II Arctic inter module in Python
27:07 - this dude built out the entire GUI he
27:11 - can remove things he has a button that
27:13 - removes items he can open a window to
27:16 - add options I'm getting hungry I'm
27:18 - getting concrete to my freedom system
27:20 - sitting over there all right he has what
27:22 - are the available options can you get
27:24 - coffee what size is hamburgers what
27:27 - sizes can you get them in right so it
27:29 - can do all of these things and then if I
27:31 - go over here this is what it looks like
27:34 - okay whoops so the applications of what
27:41 - you can do are vast it's up to you how
27:44 - you decide to actually use them yeah
27:47 - that's the creative part that's the
27:49 - actual hard part is like here's here's
27:51 - some here are some other examples right
27:54 - remember when I don't know if you ever
27:57 - got checks but when you get checks
28:00 - remember we used to
28:02 - walk to the bank to deposit the cheque
28:05 - well now you can take your cheque and
28:08 - take an image right and your bank will
28:11 - deposit it for you and how it does it is
28:13 - uses something called edge detection
28:16 - right and you you know what I'm talking
28:18 - about when you hover over your camera it
28:20 - edge detects the cheque and it'll
28:22 - automatically submit it yeah yeah you
28:24 - can crop sit it crops it right you can
28:26 - scan your card and it can edge detect
28:28 - that it's a card or it's a credit card
28:30 - and it'll pull out the numbers from
28:31 - there you know what I'm talking about
28:32 - right so you can do all those things
28:36 - that's powered with machine learning
28:37 - right and in artificial intelligence
28:41 - okay what's going on here Google slit a
28:44 - slit 34 says Google also heavily
28:46 - promotes and provides training on
28:48 - progressive web apps which is the best
28:49 - of desktop web app and best of mobile
28:52 - app combined in one awesome
28:54 - mark Austin says very helpful course I
28:57 - use it to get a job
28:58 - yo what that's awesome our course which
29:02 - course would did use profitable
29:04 - programmer to get a job marked and if
29:06 - yes man I want to bring you on to our
29:09 - livestream next tomorrow ok anybody
29:12 - who's in profitable programmer our
29:15 - course a very helpful course I use it to
29:17 - get a job who instances are there any
29:20 - autumn or there any products I can do
29:23 - even though I'm young yeah there are a
29:24 - lot of projects just look them up you go
29:26 - to my youtube ok you that program
29:28 - connect floor there go do that I just
29:30 - gave you one for program connect for it
29:33 - and come back on a future livestream
29:35 - jump in the comment in the what will
29:37 - demo your app or something yeah I just
29:40 - came from a Chicago full-stack Academy
29:41 - session where we discussed this very
29:43 - topic that's awesome my man which very
29:46 - topic because I don't know at this point
29:47 - what they're talking about but
29:49 - full-stack Academy is pretty awesome and
29:51 - no one I don't know if you know Nick
29:53 - drain but Nick drain was my original
29:55 - mentor who actually taught a full-stack
29:58 - Academy I don't know if he still teaches
30:00 - there that insomniac that's that's
30:02 - awesome a man can I learn flutter
30:05 - without feet or did Google ever shut
30:07 - down this project
30:09 - oh we never did there are flutter
30:11 - we're supposed to do so you can learn
30:14 - flutter without fear my friend there is
30:16 - no need for fear to learn flutter like
30:20 - it's pretty simple
30:22 - this shit's pretty basic you don't need
30:24 - to be very smart to be able to learn it
30:27 - you definitely don't need a college
30:29 - degree you can learn flutter any day
30:31 - like blood blood er flutter we don't
30:35 - stutter clutter hater me mother change
30:44 - the shuddered alright cool man that was
30:49 - a nice DJing on our end I'm sure that we
30:52 - should put it probably higher so no
30:55 - don't worry about it man Google is
30:57 - pushing it pretty hard flutters becoming
30:59 - pretty popular it's not going away
31:01 - anywhere well that's what we thought
31:04 - about Google lens yeah
31:07 - tell it vanish Google enter Google glass
31:09 - you'll be fine because the perfect
31:12 - google lens go Google in Google glass
31:14 - yeah the lens Google glass yeah how can
31:20 - I stay on the grind well do stuff that
31:23 - feeds you and surround yourself with
31:25 - people who are passionate and love um
31:28 - you know that's the only way is your
31:30 - environment in your environment
31:32 - about coding you need to put yourself in
31:34 - an environment where you can stay on the
31:35 - ground that's that's literally that's
31:38 - there you find people move get rid of
31:41 - distractions have like code stuff in
31:43 - your room all the time and have your
31:44 - plate just create environment for you
31:47 - where you can drive and if you don't
31:49 - know what that is and you got to figure
31:49 - it out if you can't do that we got to
31:51 - figure out how to do that yeah you going
31:52 - back until you do know how to do
31:54 - something and then just figure it out
31:57 - hi says Kazi let's be honest here you
32:00 - have absolutely no idea how to code let
32:03 - me see let me put the brightness up a
32:04 - little bit here absolutely no idea how
32:07 - to code you're repeating the same stuff
32:09 - every single day and sell BS to the
32:11 - beginners if you want to prove yourself
32:13 - how about coding now a live look dang I
32:18 - think this guy didn't see our
32:20 - our app livestream ah last week right
32:23 - where we coded a full stack when app
32:27 - Craigslist front-end badassery well yeah
32:34 - man you got me man I'm just sitting here
32:35 - I don't know how to code and just
32:38 - spewing stuff but how high if you do get
32:41 - a chance you know what
32:44 - oh I don't know how to code
32:46 - I got something for you
32:48 - watch this hold on we got it hold
32:52 - on hold on I got
32:54 - we are going to be making a Craigslist
32:57 - app clone we're gonna be doing it with
32:59 - Python and Django we're gonna be using
33:01 - beautifulsoup and web scraping and the
33:03 - end result when you type in something
33:05 - like Python tutor it looks like this not
33:08 - very pretty here when you type in a
33:10 - Python tutor like this so which one do
33:12 - you prefer this one or this one I'll
33:14 - explain it as I go I'll put one just so
33:17 - you can get the idea for this what we're
33:20 - using is something called flexbox
33:21 - so I added all of those in none of those
33:24 - refresh now what we need is the search
33:26 - bar value search so now search with the
33:30 - placeholder let's just make sure that
33:31 - it's working let's go Network hit this
33:35 - we can add some dummy images in so we're
33:39 - gonna go here paste it and delete it so
33:41 - now when we go back we refresh we're
33:44 - gonna host it on Heroku asked for if you
33:48 - click into it it'll be $360 app guys is
33:51 - actually live on Heroku
33:59 - all right there we go
34:02 - okay we just coat it right in your face
34:04 - bro right in your face okay
34:09 - cause the REO episode are software
34:11 - developer what software developer anti
34:13 - website developer but most importantly
34:15 - I'm a money developer I focus on making
34:17 - money as a developer Lucy a hot chick
34:19 - developer but I guess yeah yeah money
34:22 - developer there you go okay what if I
34:25 - just know Python as the only programming
34:28 - language watch would I do to get money
34:32 - building projects and solving problems
34:35 - is how you make money it's not related
34:37 - to your programming language it's not
34:39 - related to your ethnicity it's not
34:41 - related to what country you live in
34:43 - it's related to you solving the real
34:47 - problems that exist in the real
34:49 - marketplace next question a 17 late for
34:58 - coding you are give up now yeah
35:02 - we started here six man
35:04 - I started out of the womb why don't my
35:07 - mother's womb you got the laptop came
35:09 - out first yeah look this laptop is
35:11 - actually attached to my body look at
35:14 - look at this it's actually attached to
35:16 - my body nah man you're not late
35:20 - I didn't start coding until I was 18
35:23 - yeah I started coding when I was like
35:26 - four five years ago so like 20 or 21
35:29 - something like that literally you're
35:35 - fine man just learn from this guy
35:36 - they're from Austin you'll be good don't
35:37 - learn from my shitty college professor
35:39 - Real Talk videos promoter you're at a
35:43 - good age take advantage of it you're
35:47 - very young you have multiple multiple
35:49 - lifetimes ahead of you I also have
35:51 - multiple lifetimes ahead of me I'm only
35:53 - 25 so if you're 17 you can spend three
35:56 - years learning like one thing get really
35:59 - good at it and keep applying for work
36:01 - and you still have
36:02 - stay close to the money like six months
36:06 - and start applying three to six months
36:09 - in of coding start applying to platforms
36:11 - like wise ant take lessons and up not up
36:14 - work your won't mean you might not be
36:16 - ready for up work at that point maybe
36:17 - you might be but start applying two
36:19 - platforms you can teach other people
36:20 - coding okay so I'm talking about wise
36:24 - ant
36:25 - I'm talking about take lessons okay this
36:28 - is wise ant learn from your tutors from
36:32 - an expert tutor you can be charging like
36:34 - thirty five to fifty dollars an hour
36:36 - here okay
36:37 - between a wise ant and take lessons I
36:39 - was making over eighty thousand dollars
36:41 - a year as a developer okay holy
36:47 - take lessons live the hostess that's
36:52 - pretty cool so yeah take advantage of
36:56 - this applied these types of platforms if
36:58 - you're in a different country and you
37:00 - can't get them well just use an
37:01 - equivalent like people per hour people
37:05 - per hour okay or freelancer calm or
37:10 - fiverr.com use the equivalents and start
37:14 - applying to coding Java and start
37:20 - teaching people how to code who are
37:21 - behind you okay so if somebody is behind
37:24 - you you can teach them how to code and
37:26 - charge them thirty five to fifty dollars
37:28 - an hour or more to help them learn
37:30 - programming okay now we can start learn
37:32 - earning an income and then you can focus
37:34 - going full-time into coding having a
37:39 - master in computer science will have the
37:40 - same benefit of going to computer
37:41 - science collage yeah I mean it depends
37:46 - what you're trying to do I would say
37:47 - learn on your own
37:49 - don't get into sixty thousand dollars a
37:51 - debt and go to a coding bootcamp instead
37:55 - where it's super focused and they
37:57 - actually help you with job placement and
37:59 - interview skills and all of that that's
38:03 - what I would recommend if you have to
38:04 - spend some money
38:05 - seventeen years early as yep we are
38:10 - gonna make it active
38:16 - but all types of Najma says but if
38:19 - you're in school for computer science
38:20 - definitely work on your own personal
38:22 - projects shout out to all types of Najma
38:25 - from our instagram and she's like if
38:30 - you're in school for she has definitely
38:31 - work on her it looks better on your
38:33 - resident instead of showing your school
38:34 - projects yes yeah please work on your
38:36 - passion projects things that you
38:38 - actually enjoy doing and then build them
38:41 - you know what I mean right because if
38:45 - you just do school projects those
38:46 - projects are not gonna be good and
38:48 - they're not gonna actually help you that
38:50 - much or like find an open source project
38:52 - that you really care about and like put
38:54 - some meaningful work into it and have
38:57 - like tangible results for that that
38:58 - works too so yes do something you care
39:00 - about something that's cool there's so
39:01 - many open-source projects just google it
39:03 - yep there's a lot you can do or start
39:05 - from scratch how many interviews did you
39:07 - do before feeling comfortable okay so
39:10 - that's a good question you just do a lot
39:13 - of interviews and you feel comfortable
39:15 - with the more you do okay livestreams
39:17 - used to freak me out now the more I do
39:19 - them the more I actually enjoy them and
39:21 - I do them interviews now don't freak me
39:23 - out these guys just saw me close a
39:25 - person right now on the phone right I
39:28 - got on another call you guys remember
39:31 - when I was doing a YouTube accelerator
39:32 - program and I sold you know one of my
39:35 - people on it right on the call I'm doing
39:39 - live calls in front of everybody and I'm
39:41 - closing clients between five hundred ten
39:44 - thousand to twenty thousand dollars when
39:47 - we flew to Vegas and we closed the
39:48 - client right so those things aren't
39:52 - happening and there's a lot of pressure
39:53 - than in those situations right there's a
39:55 - lot of tension the number one thing
39:57 - you've got to deal with this pressure
39:58 - and tension if you can hold the pressure
40:00 - in tension that's where you can win if
40:03 - you come in to do a negotiation pressure
40:06 - and tension is what is one of the things
40:08 - that you have to actually be able to
40:09 - withstand so if you come in with like
40:12 - you know what price you want and you
40:15 - want seventy-five thousand dollars from
40:17 - the job and they say you know we can get
40:19 - started for fifty thousand what do you
40:21 - say
40:23 - right max we can do is 50,000 so you
40:26 - want to get started everybody and their
40:29 - mother would probably be like yes right
40:31 - but then that's why it takes you forever
40:33 - to get to 60,000 like four years later
40:35 - you have a $10,000 raise and you're so
40:37 - happy about it when if you just
40:40 - withstood those twenty minutes to zero
40:46 - 20 minutes of pressure you could have
40:49 - changed a huge aspect of your life
40:52 - instead of making 50,000 as a dis offer
40:54 - developer you oughta make and you would
40:56 - have been making $75,000 a software
40:58 - developer so my recommendation for
41:01 - interviews is go to as met fail as many
41:05 - interviews as you possibly humanly can
41:08 - go with the intention to burn out like
41:13 - get destroyed in an interview okay this
41:15 - is the only way you'll move past the
41:17 - fear and you'll actually start improving
41:19 - okay when something is making you afraid
41:21 - go right into it fear is fear nowadays
41:27 - is actually should be your GPS if public
41:30 - speaking scares you do it if interview
41:33 - scare you
41:34 - go do them it's people scare you go do
41:37 - that
41:38 - right so go do the thing that actually
41:40 - scares you is gonna help you out that's
41:42 - how you would improve your interviewing
41:44 - skills as a developer and land jobs
41:45 - Travis is providing values the key for
41:48 - sure you're not late just started at 24
41:53 - I'm 19
41:54 - awesome nathan is html/css mandatory to
41:59 - know before learning Python nope they're
42:04 - not okay you can learn them after
42:07 - learning Python cool Guana I'm 15
42:11 - learning coding that's awesome de varios
42:13 - says yes if you want to be a web dev
42:15 - okay go lay
42:21 - okay their block user a goodbye it's
42:27 - just interesting about your opinion what
42:29 - do you guess about gold Lang is that a
42:31 - great idea it's a great idea to create
42:33 - server with help of go I don't know
42:38 - anything about go so I don't I'm not
42:40 - gonna answer something I don't know
42:42 - about spam scam guys keep it clean I'm
42:49 - just gonna start deleting everyone
42:51 - that's not keeping it clean because I
42:54 - want to make sure that the community is
42:56 - made up of clean people because when you
42:58 - have one toxic person it starts to
43:00 - spread very quickly and that's a last
43:02 - thing we want because what happens with
43:04 - us is then we don't want to do it
43:07 - anymore you know and then you guys don't
43:08 - want to be in the community anymore so
43:10 - let's please focus on keeping it clean
43:12 - maybe some people in here if they want
43:14 - to become moderators they can become
43:15 - moderators and they can kick somebody
43:17 - out and produce panels definitely be
43:19 - your moderator I'm surprised anyone
43:42 - buying into just watch some of these
43:46 - videos the quota says take the courses
43:49 - perhaps Thank You Dakota okay Dakota is
43:54 - actually standing up for us so I really
43:55 - appreciate that
43:56 - Arlen says begin flutter is extremely
43:59 - powerful technology which definitely
44:00 - will be supported by Google yep agreed
44:03 - agreed
44:06 - cool he's just not shelling it for us
44:08 - because most people starting out coding
44:10 - don't know most things about it yes my
44:12 - friend thank you
44:13 - because when we create so here's what's
44:15 - going on right our YouTube channel has
44:16 - been on the decline it's dying
44:18 - we are happy creating technical
44:21 - tutorials but we created one that was
44:23 - three hours long okay one two and three
44:30 - okay three hours long and what ended up
44:34 - happening was it's getting it gets very
44:37 - little views and you get very little I'm
44:40 - also so technical there were actually
44:42 - very few people viewing it more surface
44:45 - level content actually gets more views
44:47 - that's why CSS crash course will get
44:50 - more views and HTML crash course will
44:51 - get more views and so that's where the
44:53 - problem comes in right content creators
44:55 - we can spend a lot of time creating
44:57 - something days weeks that's our
45:00 - livelihood
45:01 - then it gets no results and so we need
45:04 - to create self that's easily digestible
45:06 - for you entertaining for the viewer and
45:10 - at the same time helps our channel
45:12 - survive and not die right because our
45:14 - channel is you know some weird way at
45:16 - the verge of dying which text editor is
45:21 - best when learning to PI to beginning to
45:24 - learn Python so there are a lot of
45:25 - different ones you can use Visual Studio
45:28 - code is definitely my one of my favorite
45:31 - text editors if you want to graduate
45:34 - into becoming a big boy then I recommend
45:38 - using pycharm
45:40 - alright which is not a text editor which
45:42 - is the integrated development
45:44 - environment but it's super powerful it
45:47 - understands a lot about what's happening
45:50 - with your code and it's pretty badass so
45:53 - I recommend using a integrated
45:58 - development environment because what's
46:00 - cool about this is you can set up your
46:02 - virtual environments inside of this you
46:04 - can set up your databases inside of this
46:07 - once you install packages it can
46:10 - understand that for you if you're
46:12 - building a project in Django or
46:14 - JavaScript or whatever it can actually
46:17 - understand how your MVC framework is
46:19 - working it can understand how your model
46:21 - is related to your template and how that
46:24 - are related to your view and you can go
46:27 - in between and it can figure out a lot
46:29 - of things for you such that it's almost
46:30 - like having an intelligent human
46:32 - software developer on your shoulder not
46:36 - just a person who's looking for grammar
46:37 - errors kind of like vs code and how its
46:40 - using the linting and it's like oh the
46:42 - styling is
46:43 - or maybe you should style it like this
46:45 - not those errors this is actually like a
46:48 - intelligent software developer that's
46:50 - sitting hands like buddy buddy buddy
46:52 - buddy listen you're up man
46:55 - do it right you know what I'm saying
46:57 - that's the idea here so let's go back
47:01 - today to the shat as one might say Lord
47:07 - yeah but just standard idle will not be
47:10 - a bad idea but you can also use pie
47:12 - chart from JetBrains yeah there you go
47:13 - somebody answered for you how is Python
47:16 - be t.j.s
47:17 - how is Python beating Jay as though
47:19 - that's a great question so that's not
47:21 - that's not clickbait we actually have a
47:25 - thing whoa what is happening let's go
47:32 - here let me show you we got show me so I
47:37 - got show you what we got so python is
47:40 - beating out JavaScript in the trends
47:43 - over here as you can see right python is
47:46 - eating javascript for breakfast because
47:49 - python is a snake okay
47:52 - Python is Python most what's questions
47:58 - asked
47:59 - Stack Overflow why JavaScript was going
48:02 - down though
48:03 - pythons obviously going up but I'm
48:06 - wondering why javascript is going down
48:07 - right so python has officially overtaken
48:11 - will we ever be able to see this image
48:14 - copy the image address paste on Python
48:19 - is actually beating it out and it's on
48:22 - the upward trend really aggressively so
48:26 - this is what we mean by pythons
48:30 - interests and trends are showing signs
48:32 - of crazy growth as we go forward
48:35 - especially with the machine learning and
48:36 - data machine learning and data science
48:38 - and AI there's a huge market with this
48:41 - stuff okay so actually let's just leave
48:46 - that screen right there in the back so
48:48 - when people also when people join in
48:51 - they can actually
48:52 - see that nothing nice job it's good all
48:58 - right
48:58 - that's pretty cool actually anybody who
49:00 - joins will be like oh that's yeah
49:01 - they're on the graphs yeah Google Trends
49:04 - okay it's a new thing to just love just
49:06 - some specific language to know it's not
49:08 - like you have to learn what the project
49:10 - requires even if it is assembly language
49:12 - okay great point real Islam yeah so yeah
49:17 - again languages don't matter as much you
49:20 - have to see what each project requires
49:22 - okay that's definitely very very
49:24 - important yeah there's no beyond in all
49:26 - programming language like Python is
49:27 - great and very versatile but if you want
49:29 - to do mobile you're not gonna use Python
49:31 - okay
49:31 - do you want to do like operating
49:33 - system-level stuff like hyper on steam
49:34 - computing stuff you're not gonna use
49:36 - Python so obviously some jobs are gonna
49:37 - require other languages but python is
49:40 - very good to get a lot of jobs done but
49:42 - obviously there are jobs that yep
49:44 - Python companies and there sometimes you
49:46 - do need assembly that's true but I mean
49:47 - that's only if you want to do assembly
49:49 - job yeah I want to do with sembly jobs I
49:51 - know it's kind of fun sometimes but yeah
49:54 - it's fun for like little big this guy
49:56 - goes to rip h14 w oh yeah yeah
50:02 - all right this the next question I gotta
50:04 - leave after this you guys I have
50:05 - interview four policemen three days I
50:07 - don't have any project what's happening
50:08 - here there's lots of same questions
50:10 - being copied pasted kind of fell behind
50:13 - forty seventeen minutes behind ah okay
50:15 - okay so let's keep going my thoughts
50:17 - exactly
50:17 - I started coding at 32 that's awesome my
50:20 - man yeah so you see it's still young
50:24 - Shafi says can you give me some
50:26 - information about up work I have done a
50:28 - little bit of C++ and C just need some
50:30 - advice to stick to code and improve so
50:32 - what the information I will give you
50:34 - right is similar to what I was saying
50:36 - earlier so if I go to opera calm or
50:38 - sorry here I'll go and I'll type in c
50:41 - plus plus let's see if I get anything
50:44 - for it right so I'll go to jobs and I'll
50:47 - see what kind of jobs are people posting
50:51 - here so if there are any C++ type of
50:54 - jobs then I will recommend you apply for
50:57 - that right seeking C++ developer apply
51:00 - within entry-level job
51:04 - create a job board scraper and it
51:07 - requires C++ okay
51:09 - so look at upward for what jobs are
51:13 - available and then kind of work your way
51:15 - back to learning those technologies and
51:17 - continuously applying to them and if you
51:20 - can send all of these people a video
51:21 - message
51:22 - that's even better all right I'm a huge
51:24 - believer in video messaging okay let's
51:32 - see what's going on
51:39 - started coding at nineteen one I've
51:42 - given myself one year to become a full
51:44 - stack developer how can I become a pro
51:47 - in that time okay
51:51 - becoming a pro is a matter of how many
51:53 - hours you put in so if you put thousand
51:56 - or more hours you're gonna be pretty
51:57 - damn good so if you're coding ten hours
52:01 - a day five to ten hours a day you are
52:03 - gonna be well on your way to become a
52:05 - pro you'll be pretty damn good where
52:08 - your strengths aren't an income well
52:10 - before one year okay okay that's a
52:18 - family in town so this guy will take
52:19 - care of you mr. Cozzi as he always does
52:22 - peace out thank you for being in the
52:23 - live stream all right Aaron take care
52:25 - you guys yep peace out enjoy family
52:30 - let's be real here I'm learning Python
52:33 - and flutter I haven't seen any language
52:35 - cooler than Python really you guys are
52:36 - great both great tutors this teacher day
52:38 - today in Nepal happy teachers day to the
52:41 - whole team a hell yeah awesome man so
52:44 - that is amazing videos promotor yeah
52:47 - Python and flutter is fun with Python I
52:50 - would created a Django rest framework
52:52 - and then I would actually just code that
52:54 - the app up and flutter and then just
52:57 - combine the two that'd be fun
53:00 - hello bless from Cameroon awesome Java
53:03 - core line is Java core language also
53:05 - required in today's freelance market to
53:07 - be relevant or Python and Django is more
53:09 - than sufficient Java I'm sure you can
53:12 - find freelancing jobs for Java there's
53:14 - no shortage of that Python and Django is
53:16 - something that I personally prefer the
53:19 - reason why I push for Python so much is
53:21 - because of the trend of the data science
53:24 - and machine learning so if you're good
53:26 - with this language and you have your
53:28 - fundamentals strong yo can we not wash
53:30 - anything right now so this guy's like
53:34 - just crazy just washing stuff all the
53:36 - time
53:38 - so if we have pas if you have Python
53:42 - right then in the data science trend is
53:44 - going higher in the data and analytics
53:46 - is going higher I just think it's a
53:47 - great place to be playing at
53:53 - Python is my first language but I left
53:55 - it because school wasn't teaching it a
53:57 - lot of schools are now actually starting
53:59 - to teach Python now I use JavaScript a
54:03 - lot do you suggest I move on or just go
54:06 - with Python if you're using one language
54:08 - already keep going with this for
54:09 - building projects okay if you're stuck
54:12 - in beginner phase still with JavaScript
54:14 - then sure switch to Python so you don't
54:17 - have to deal with all the complexity you
54:18 - can just get to actually building
54:20 - and then you can go back to doing
54:21 - JavaScript what I figured was like some
54:25 - a crazy epiphany that I had was I
54:28 - started actually becoming a lot better
54:31 - than a lot of JavaScript developers by
54:32 - going deep into Python in my early
54:35 - learning stages because nothing got in
54:37 - my way I kept being able to learn things
54:39 - quickly and build things quickly Python
54:42 - never got in my way so I was very
54:44 - productive with my development and I was
54:46 - able to solve difficult problems not get
54:49 - stuck in the syntactical issues not get
54:52 - stuck in the asynchronous programming
54:54 - issues that you'll have with web
54:56 - development some weird esoteric problems
54:59 - I was spending my time fundamentals down
55:02 - so if you're a beginner I would say
55:04 - learn Python to get your fundamentals
55:06 - down and then you can switch to
55:08 - JavaScript right after yeah rick and
55:10 - morty hell yeah hi this is what book
55:12 - should I learned to learn Python a great
55:14 - book that I actually recommend for all
55:16 - of you guys if you go on Amazon's called
55:18 - learn Python by John Zell or not learn
55:23 - Python I'm sorry I'm sorry it's called
55:25 - computer science by Johns L so this is a
55:31 - very very good book that I recommend to
55:35 - every single person even if you're not a
55:37 - Python developer I recommend it it's a
55:41 - great book and it really helps you learn
55:42 - a lot of like programming concepts I
55:44 - don't know it just did the trick for me
55:46 - okay did the trick for me that's all
55:48 - that's all I can say
55:51 - - courses in community colleges they
55:53 - started adding them way faster than in
55:56 - universities just because we say that
55:57 - again say it louder so people that want
56:00 - to flatter people that want to start
56:01 - taking Python classes can actually go to
56:04 - community colleges because they're
56:06 - easier they're like wait faster to adapt
56:08 - new technologies compared to
56:10 - universities because they they take too
56:12 - long to take to change curriculums so if
56:15 - you want to take a Python fast like
56:16 - right now you can go to your local
56:17 - community college and actually just you
56:20 - know oh so you can actually take lots of
56:24 - classes with Python from their local
56:27 - community colleges that's amazing yeah
56:30 - so you don't have to you can skip out on
56:31 - the University in that case and just
56:33 - like specialize in Python Zul fee says
56:37 - yo yo what's up people tag everything as
56:39 - scam if they can't do it for sure that's
56:40 - you know definitely true like if people
56:42 - can do it or they can't wrap their mind
56:44 - around you have to put in some kind of
56:46 - box and so they're just like okay we're
56:47 - just gonna call it scam that makes our
56:50 - job a lot easier what are the different
56:52 - types of development of Python like
56:54 - webdirect and ooh with Python right you
56:57 - can do data analysis you could do web
57:01 - development you could do machine
57:03 - learning where you can do like image
57:05 - detection you can detect faces you can
57:07 - detect credit cards you could detect
57:09 - suspicious behavior you could detect
57:11 - moving objects there's a lot of things
57:14 - that you can do in the field of Python
57:18 - okay
57:18 - so I would definitely say that let me
57:23 - see if I can pull up my Instagram video
57:25 - that talks about this cuz it's pretty
57:27 - good and it'll give you guys some
57:29 - insight in a quick fashion into what are
57:34 - some of the things that you can do with
57:36 - Python so I'll put the volume up of it
57:42 - three reasons like you should become a
57:44 - better developer actually down one is
57:50 - more focused on why should I become a
57:52 - web developer let me see if where I have
57:54 - the one which goes three reason why you
57:56 - should learn Python here's here's a good
57:58 - one
58:01 - and refill would you believe it it's
58:05 - actually powered by Python Netflix is
58:07 - power about Python did you know that
58:10 - Netflix was powered by the Python a lot
58:15 - of people don't know that software
58:17 - driven networking is actually a huge
58:19 - thing data analysis software never
58:24 - networking a Python juice take photo
58:40 - block whole stack development do that
58:43 - with a time this is powered by power but
58:48 - I thought Google's YouTube Instagram
58:50 - reddit Dropbox Pinterest Eventbrite and
58:53 - Spotify
58:54 - [Music]
59:00 - okay so there you have it those are some
59:03 - of the things you can do with Python
59:06 - hopefully that gives you a little bit of
59:08 - insight into it let us go back and watch
59:13 - our tutorials what do you think is
59:23 - possible to land a job if you only know
59:25 - in the basic fundamentals of Python you
59:27 - have to know more than just the
59:28 - fundamentals you have to know how to
59:31 - problem-solve in coding you have to be
59:33 - able to think at a deeper level and
59:35 - understand what are the actual problems
59:37 - that are trying to solve then you got to
59:39 - be creating a below for the solves the
59:41 - problem okay so it's not just the
59:44 - fundamentals of Python that'll help you
59:46 - get a job you gotta understand how do
59:49 - you actually go about solving somebody's
59:52 - specific problem coding horror I wrote a
59:54 - great blog on like should you learn let
59:58 - me see if I can find it coding horror
60:03 - why don't become a programmer or
60:09 - something like that I think you've wrote
60:10 - something please don't learn to code and
60:12 - he said something really great okay let
60:21 - me find it
60:43 - if we if we don't learn to plum we risk
60:47 - being plumbed ourselves plum bow or be
60:50 - plumped so he says I love programming
60:52 - also love I also believe programming is
60:54 - important in the right context for some
60:56 - people but so are a lot of skills I
60:59 - would no more urge everyone to learn
61:01 - programming then I would urge to learn
61:03 - plumbing right here's the thing that he
61:06 - says about lines of code okay this one
61:12 - this is where I think I got it yeah he
61:17 - goes it's is as soon as a more code in
61:20 - the world is an inherently desirable
61:22 - thing in my 30-year career as a
61:25 - programmer I have found this not to be
61:27 - the case should you learn to write code
61:29 - no I can't get behind that you should be
61:33 - learning to write as little code as
61:35 - possible it assumes that coding is the
61:38 - goal software developers tend to be
61:40 - software addicts who think their job is
61:42 - to write code but it's not their job is
61:46 - to solve problems
61:48 - don't celebrate the creation of code
61:50 - celebrate the creation of solutions we
61:53 - have way too many coders addicted to
61:55 - doing just one more line of code already
62:01 - so this is why I say that just the
62:08 - fundamentals of Python aren't gonna help
62:10 - you really understand how to solve
62:13 - problems and then actually try to code
62:15 - it as little as possible and focus on
62:17 - solving the problem learn JavaScript
62:19 - first or framework can you tell about it
62:21 - yep you can do either or just learn job
62:24 - sorry learn JavaScript first get the
62:26 - fundamentals right then learn frameworks
62:28 - on top of it more Rick and Morty Chris
62:31 - says also Charlie says that was a great
62:33 - impression whoo Rick thanks charlie
62:35 - that's awesome
62:39 - today what about data scientists after
62:41 - three years is it still most wanted yes
62:43 - data science is only gonna be growing
62:45 - till now I busted almost 50 times an
62:47 - interview but still not giving up
62:49 - looking for Python job opportunities in
62:50 - Tokyo since January 2019
62:52 - beautiful keep going Jeep get more
62:55 - intelligent about how you're applying
62:57 - but keep going as of now you should
63:00 - start applying to teaching coding to
63:02 - people on platforms like wise ant and
63:04 - take lessons so you can actually start
63:06 - generating an income from coding as of
63:09 - now you should do whatever he wants man
63:14 - ok should do both do you think a
63:23 - beginner in Python can learn web develop
63:25 - a wet web scraping filing a directories
63:27 - or should you start from the basics
63:28 - first you can learn web scraping filing
63:30 - in directories you should okay here's a
63:34 - real answer learn the basics first learn
63:38 - the fundamentals first so I have my free
63:41 - course in the description below you can
63:43 - actually click on it's a 5 day free
63:45 - Python course it's pretty amazing we
63:47 - have a lot of 70,000 plus students
63:49 - enrolled in it at this point that's
63:51 - gonna teach you a lot of the basics but
63:53 - here's me here's how I'm gonna answer
63:58 - this right if you are somebody who has
64:01 - little motivation you want to do a
64:04 - project to keep you motivated so you
64:06 - don't quit then go and do the
64:09 - directories and filing and direct and
64:12 - web scraping right now follow somebody's
64:14 - tutorial and just do that right now
64:15 - maybe that'll just keep you in the game
64:16 - longer but if you want to do it
64:18 - correctly learn the basics first because
64:21 - when you're doing web scraping right
64:22 - you're gonna need to know how classes
64:24 - and objects work you're gonna need to
64:28 - know how modules work you're gonna need
64:29 - to import beautifulsoup and requests
64:31 - right then you're gonna need to create a
64:33 - request object and a beautiful soup
64:35 - object those require you to actually
64:38 - know how classes and python work then on
64:42 - top of that you're gonna need to build
64:43 - out when you scrape the data you're
64:46 - gonna get back some file type what is
64:48 - that file type ok is it text is a JSON
64:53 - it's really like weird right when you
64:55 - have to drill down into the a tags and
64:57 - the classes and you're drilling down
65:00 - into those elements on a page well how
65:03 - are you gonna deal with that if you
65:05 - don't understand how data structure is
65:06 - like lists and dictionaries work at a
65:10 - pretty deep level so what I will say to
65:15 - you is the correct way is really learn
65:18 - the fundamentals and basics and problem
65:20 - solving first and then go for it but if
65:22 - it means you're gonna quit programming
65:24 - then do the thing that makes it fun for
65:25 - you so you can keep doing it for a long
65:27 - period of time PyCharm can do basic
65:29 - sequel queries for you true okay I can
65:36 - use Python to hack you can use Python to
65:37 - hack for sure concerned citizen says so
65:43 - two days ago I got introduced to you
65:45 - very interested in coding I'm 46 years
65:46 - old I would like to be able to work from
65:48 - home is this possible here's the answer
65:52 - this is very possible that's the short
65:56 - answer
65:57 - the long answer is do it if it excites
66:01 - you and if it interests you because it's
66:04 - hard but it's also very enjoyable okay
66:08 - it's contagious coding it literally
66:09 - feels like playing a video game if you
66:12 - enjoy it
66:14 - okay so if you're 46 you can be spending
66:18 - a lot of hours in a day learning coding
66:21 - and by the time you're 46 and a half or
66:23 - by the time you're 47 you should already
66:26 - be earning an income right so here's how
66:28 - I would lay down the road map for you if
66:30 - I was concerned citizen concerned
66:33 - citizen who is 46 years old and I want
66:36 - to be able to work from home here's
66:39 - exactly what I would do I would start
66:42 - watching tutorials and learning coding
66:45 - at the same time I would be on up work a
66:48 - lot and I would be typing in and looking
66:51 - for any kind of jobs I could apply for
66:53 - write Python related so I'd be looking
66:55 - at seeking web scraping specialists okay
66:58 - so I'd be like cool I'm gonna be working
67:00 - on my web scraping skills because
67:02 - there's a demand for it in the market
67:03 - I'm gonna help
67:05 - working on Django because people are
67:07 - talking about Django cool but in order
67:10 - to be able to do that I'm gonna reverse
67:11 - engineer that and I'm gonna learn the
67:13 - basics of Python first and really get
67:15 - them on point so one once I learn my
67:19 - Python fundamentals two I start moving
67:22 - on to web development okay while you are
67:25 - moving on to learning web development
67:27 - skills here's what I would recommend for
67:29 - your concerned citizens there you go two
67:31 - platforms likewise ant and take lessons
67:33 - comm and you start actually tutoring
67:37 - others in Python and in coding and you
67:40 - should start charging these people
67:42 - thirty five to fifty dollars an hour
67:44 - within a few months of aggressively
67:47 - reaching out to 30 to 50 people a day
67:49 - you should be able to get your income to
67:52 - one to three thousand dollars a month
67:54 - without too much effort once you can do
67:57 - that you're already working from home
67:59 - teaching other people coding you're
68:01 - already making an income you can do
68:03 - online lessons here okay you can do
68:06 - online lessons training people in coding
68:08 - making between 35 to 75 or a hundred
68:11 - dollars an hour depending on your skill
68:13 - the reviews you have the testimonials
68:16 - you have all of those things and then
68:19 - you can go on to start once you know you
68:24 - do that for like six months to a year
68:25 - and then you can go on to just go
68:28 - full-time on the freelancing okay
68:31 - meaning start applying to lots of friend
68:33 - Lansing opportunities and you can be
68:35 - apply trying to get you know skill your
68:39 - income between one to five thousand
68:41 - dollars extra per month from freelancing
68:45 - job opportunities for Python the best
68:48 - job opportunities you're not gonna find
68:49 - on upwork.com or wherever go to meetups
68:53 - and start going today so you can build
68:57 - and cultivate those relationships in the
68:59 - community use Instagram really
69:01 - intelligently and find other developers
69:04 - and build relationships with them get on
69:05 - calls with them go out and have coffee
69:07 - with them because when you're ready
69:11 - these people will have job opportunities
69:14 - lined up for you for days that is by far
69:17 - the number one
69:18 - way to get job opportunities okay you
69:21 - can use LinkedIn for this and build
69:23 - relationships with software developers
69:25 - you can email developers who work at
69:27 - Google and Netflix and literally ask to
69:30 - speak with them get a coffee with them
69:32 - ask them questions interview them or
69:34 - become their students and there are a
69:37 - lot of developers who would be more than
69:39 - happy to take you on and actually teach
69:42 - you coding even without you having to
69:44 - pay them so you build those
69:45 - relationships and you build your skill
69:48 - at the same time it's almost impossible
69:51 - they're gonna be out of you're not gonna
69:53 - have opportunities you're actually gonna
69:54 - be flooded with the amount of
69:56 - opportunities you're gonna have you're
69:57 - gonna have to turn a lot of these
69:59 - opportunities down okay thanks for
70:06 - considering my point cause II later hey
70:08 - Ron what's the best way to study from a
70:14 - book McCulloch
70:15 - that's a good question best way to study
70:18 - from a book my friend I say is really
70:22 - spend a lot of time coding alongside the
70:26 - book have your computer or laptop or
70:29 - whatever open and be coding the entire
70:32 - time right alongside the book that you
70:35 - are reading consumption should be 15% of
70:40 - your time or 10% of your time creation
70:42 - should be 90 to 85 to 90 percent of your
70:45 - time and then you will do really well in
70:47 - anything especially coding I think your
70:50 - channel is awesome I used flutter and
70:51 - Python two great languages real code
70:53 - that's amazing if you want to teach me
70:55 - flutter because I want to learn flutter
70:57 - that would be amazing how to really
70:58 - appreciate it reach out to me on
71:01 - instagram at clever cause ii okay and
71:05 - just drop it in context what you're
71:07 - doing clever cause he's like spell like
71:09 - that on instagram and i would love to
71:13 - learn flutter okay because i have been
71:14 - spent any time learning it so if
71:16 - somebody knows that in the community
71:18 - just get on a call and teach me and then
71:20 - i can help you with whatever you know
71:22 - getting clients and stuff
71:28 - carlos goes can we not wash anything
71:31 - right now google ever shut down ah there
71:37 - one not shut it down okay I will at some
71:43 - point depending on what the demand there
71:46 - is for it but I think that actually
71:47 - could be a pretty great opportunity
71:53 - Kevin yeah I learned Java after after
71:58 - Python and that really really helped me
72:00 - actually learn Java I learned it a lot
72:01 - faster because of that oh wow I have
72:04 - that book Charlie says that's awesome
72:05 - the Python the computer science by john
72:08 - zell jason says python can create a
72:10 - system like payroll system yep
72:12 - I've actually built a payroll system
72:13 - with Python will I be only building
72:16 - recipe as a Django dev not really but
72:19 - that's part of it I think you should
72:23 - check out and give feedback or promote
72:25 - Python course of best Python course and
72:26 - tutorial on YouTube this guy is amazing
72:28 - check it out I promise you would love it
72:31 - ok
72:32 - is that my course because my once my
72:35 - thing is called best Python course so
72:39 - yeah thank you if that's for me I am
72:44 - working in a tech support but have basic
72:46 - knowledge only in Java can I switch to
72:49 - Python and learn and do project and
72:51 - Python search for a job what do you
72:52 - recommend to me
72:53 - for sure if you already know a
72:54 - programming language guys changing
72:56 - languages is like changing diapers you
72:58 - can change it so fast ok or clothes
73:02 - that's a better example you can learn a
73:04 - language really fast if you know one if
73:08 - you as long as you know the concepts in
73:09 - one so yeah you can switch to Python and
73:11 - search for a job but like you can also
73:13 - just be in Java and search for a job ok
73:15 - you're not Java is not like going
73:18 - anywhere we can we can type in Java here
73:20 - as well
73:26 - right so Java is pretty popular it's
73:28 - right next to all of these it's not
73:30 - going anywhere so if you already know it
73:33 - and if you already enjoy it and there's
73:35 - no reason for you to go and learn Python
73:37 - then don't learn Python but if you want
73:40 - to learn Python then learn it
73:56 - there we go
73:58 - there we go there's no world out there
74:05 - that we I want to make a web application
74:09 - which is based on data science and
74:11 - machine learning so what should I add or
74:14 - merge with Python tensorflow matplotlib
74:16 - or something else yep
74:17 - all of the above so tensorflow I think
74:20 - you would need to add in you would need
74:21 - to add in there's like some other
74:23 - libraries I haven't done too much with
74:25 - machine learning so I'm not gonna steer
74:27 - you wrong but look up some Django
74:29 - tutorials with some kind of machine
74:31 - learning and I bet you'll pull something
74:34 - up dude Django devs also work on views
74:40 - and templates or front-end frameworks
74:42 - have taken over you could do both my
74:43 - friend you could work on views and
74:45 - templates or you can use front-end
74:47 - frameworks as well I mean it's it's
74:49 - really up to you for an and what the
74:51 - project requires but if the project
74:53 - requires like having a really incredible
74:56 - front-end then yeah you're not gonna use
74:58 - Django for your front-end you're gonna
75:00 - use something else but if you're gonna
75:02 - be fine with the project and they don't
75:05 - care as much and it's more just for the
75:07 - internal business then you can use
75:08 - Django and be fine I want to make a
75:12 - decentralized app which requires
75:13 - JavaScript and Python that's great I
75:15 - have a friend his name is he has a
75:19 - channel called DAP University and he
75:22 - teaches you how to do blockchain apps
75:24 - and so he's pretty good for that I would
75:27 - highly recommend actually looking his
75:29 - channel up let's vlog you yesterday
75:31 - coding that's great what do you think
75:33 - about coding boot camps I think that
75:34 - coding boot camps are great you should
75:38 - definitely look into them I think
75:40 - they're great
75:41 - anything that requires intensive
75:43 - learning over a focused period of time
75:48 - that's incredible oh okay
75:54 - it's and things were the answer you got
75:56 - it my man
75:57 - oh yeah I'm gonna think about making a
76:00 - digital course for sure when you think
76:03 - that I shouldn't mention I love to
76:05 - problem-solve and love to learn you know
76:07 - so I got interested that's amazing
76:10 - oh you're gonna if you want to compile
76:14 - that'd be great Kazi is amazing thank
76:18 - you
76:19 - videos promoter diapers well tell that
76:21 - to my one-year-old John Harmon yep you
76:24 - got it I will
76:26 - and also if you're interested in
76:28 - mentoring with me what I help you either
76:32 - with getting clients starting your own

Cleaned transcript:

sup guys this is konzi here from clever programmer calm I'm here with Erin and today we got a lot of cool stuff for you so why is Python beating out JavaScript when it comes to Google Trends we're gonna be talking about that and we're gonna be talking about quite a few things as you can see here we've got some jokes for you today we got what can you do with Python and we'll also be doing a lot of Q&A because this is live to keep dropping your questions we'll take some in the start some in the middle some at the end at the end for sure so without any further ado what do you say iron shall we jump right into it music here we go so as you can see over here JavaScript and Python programming languages from 2004 to present right now right what do we have over here javascript was super popular highly highly searched and it still is popular don't get me wrong but as you sort of see this line like a snake that Python is around 2017 right around 2016 and 2017 right when I our channel started growing right it started beating out job JavaScript and in terms of its interest rate on Google Trends it's actually beat it out okay and we'll turn off the music now and actually in stack overflow job Python is actually the number one now most questioned language the language that asking the most questions for Python yep which shows which tells me that the trend for this language is actually really really really high okay we have some people jumping in what is up gene my man what's going on what is up jinsa what is up spider what is up Hudson what is up who saw how is it going okay so now we're gonna jump into our next segment which is this is a great blog post that I was going through by promote and it's a Python or JavaScript which one should I choose and you know the TLDR are both are really good but we're gonna talk a little bit about things that people kind of overlook and don't talk as much about okay so first of all we're not we're not gonna go through every single one of these but some of these I definitely want to hit on so let's talk about the ease of use and the beginner how friendly something is right so when it comes to when it comes to the ease of use and how friendly something is Python you have JavaScript and then you have Python and I think in my opinion Python is much more beginner friendly and the reason for that is you don't have to deal with the complexity of things being online things are hard enough already when you're coding as a beginner to deal with the complexity of the online it gets even more difficult and here is something that we prepared for you to show you right I have a new framework down here Johnny and then everybody JavaScript developer ever jumps down there okay that is one example of why JavaScript is super complicated here's another example of why JavaScript might be a little bit complicated okay hopefully our buttons work there we go cool sometimes when programming in JavaScript I just want to yell this but I can't remember what this refers to so the objectoriented portion of JavaScript is also a little bit confusing and then the new things that introduce with each new launch of es6 it only gets more and more complex so if you are a beginner or even intermediate or even advanced you constantly have to keep learning new things right which is which is what most developers should do but if you're a beginner intermediate it can really hurt your learning okay then we get into versatility and uncertain one of these right so for example with versatility they're both pretty good when it comes to web development or you have enterprise when you have versatility right here right when you have web development or Enterprise development or when it comes to machine learning and data science JavaScript and Python blows goal kind of handinhand they got the they both do a little bit of a combat here right but when it comes to machine learning and data science Java Python is definitely taking the cake and with most things going to machine learning and a lot of things going to data science it's very important to catch the trends while they're happening because the people like Columbus are probably not Columbus but people who discovered the transfers are usually the people who are on the winning side if you got into blockchain or I'm sorry Bitcoin very early on which I did but my family freaked out otherwise we would have been millionaires right now which would have been really cool but if you got into Bitcoin early on you would make a lot of money shitton right yeah if you got into Apple stock early or something like that when it was little yeah fidget spinners yeah jump on that leg right away right need a lot of money and not everybody just like lagging behind those spinners the dropshipping on fidget spinner was probably really hot too so if you catch on to these trends when they're happening and you catch that wave it's really really powerful for example there's an article by Forbes that talks about 800 million jobs right let me go see if I can find it drop in the Forbes 30 ok so let's see over here so this article actually talks about how what kind of ad is that music yeah no no no cuz I'm pretty good I want to look at that a new study by McKinsey Global Institute estimates that between 400 million and 800 million of today's jobs will be automated by 2030 and which means that a lot of jobs are gonna be automated by a machine a lot of things that people are doing manual labor for currently ok so check out services like scan and go already in Walmart it's like replacing it cashiers are going on a business right apparently helicopter helicopter drivers not oh yeah drivers are going out of business right lyft and uber are already like doing selfdriving cars and so uber copters are going to be coming out maybe they're gonna be selfdriving too and so the things that are doing data science and machine learning which are gonna be super hot those are gonna be the things that are gonna have the trend and one of the reasons we believe Python is going really really far in this is because precisely because of its capability to do machine learning and data science so let's go forward into our beautiful graphs that beautiful pictures that we have here prepared for you guys learning C in college never gonna move oh cool I want to give a shout out to all types of Najma who was on my Instagram and she did an internship in Chicago also this is what she did was super cool she joined one of my courses called Python oo Pete recently and while she was actually driving she was coding and then she sent me the screenshot of going through the course so we thought that was pretty awesome because what is your Excuse now not code right it can be driving and coding at the same time let's keep going through much support my bro hey William Kirk what is going on Darrell guys keep asking your questions we're gonna be taking their questions at the end and answering them at the same time so Hudson we're gonna take your question right second okay and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring your question in so everybody else can see it as well all right here we go hey why they're always keen on money's are trying people to learn some programming language I think he's talking about us Aaron I think so too it I think he's insulting I think he's pointing fingers pointing fingers pointing fingers man why they always keen on money to attract people to learn some programs yeah well because you know you know money is cool man money is kind of important look at what yeah look at languages that don't make any money you can do that too if you want how can I get a remote job with Python is a backend developer so what I recommend is to go on up work and to actually apply to places that like literally start finding jobs related to Python whether they're a backend or frontend or whatever end right need quick help with a Django project there's a user and product model in my jingle there's your backend job I found you your backend job here it is 14 minutes ago entrylevel right talk at the top this is it this is your job go and apply for it right now okay this guy needs some basic stuff user and a product model this is how you start applying to jobs to keep building that experience and then you can go for sure this is a 30 minute job but if you keep applying and landing these you're gonna be doing the much bigger jobs that are available here on up work check this out it says I need someone who is available to start right now and finish it within the next one to two hours there you go do it now go literally do it right now yeah okay so there you go man I always have such an easy time finding these guys a backend question boom found is a backend answer yeah there you go you just got back ended okay so hopefully that answers your question excuses are pushing you back that is correct always how many days can I become a full stack developer please reply it depends on the amount of hours you code if you code between hundred thousand hours that's pretty decent amount of hours to become a full stack developer and to be able to get these jobs the one I just showed on up work for example is a very possible job that you can do within one month of learning Python and Django literally one month you can make a first 30 dollars from coding you make your first 30 dollars then you can make you 100 first hundred dollars from coding with Python you can make your first thousand dollars and make your first ten thousand dollars and maybe being on your way to making 10 20 30 40 thousand dollars that year from just coding from these side projects ok so it really depends first of all how many hours you put in what made it easy for me to code and learn was I was putting in about 15 to 18 hours a day the more time you put in upfront the more days you'll save from the back end can Julia replace Python what is Julia I'll have to look it up it's a machine learning thing I think crashing into everything coding Waialae driving no she was not driving Mark Austin she was a passenger there's always somebody who's like bringing that up or any coding while you're driving why are you listening to audible while driving you can crash a car I'm pretty young but I could still do any projects Python good job jinsa amalah eyah hey Malaya thank you love you too my friend programming wood project says javascript has frontend framework Python has no frontend framework sure so why don't you do what developer builds this thing and do Python and Django you get full backend and then on top of that slap JavaScript so what I like to do is I like to do Python and Django and then using Django rest framework create a API and then just use JavaScript from there to do my frontend stuff so you can use view j/s if you wanted to you can use angular you can use react use use whatever you want but whichever part I can do it in Django I'll do because it just makes my life a lot easier okay please explain I don't understand it can we use JavaScript for mobile applications development what we recommend you do is actually look into flutter it's a thing made at language made by Google is being popularized and there are a lot of developers in demand for flutter and it's developed by Google okay flutter is developed by Google and another another great thing about flutter is that you can do it's one language Dart and it allows you to build applications for both iOS and Android so you don't need to learn Android development and then you don't need to learn to make an Android app and then you don't and then you don't have to learn iOS to make iOS app wow we're getting a lot of viewers this is amazing seventythree concurrent viewers okay awesome guys we're gonna keep going with this okay so learn flutter flutter is gonna be unbelievable for you movie when it comes to development and we'll make a clever programmer app and share it with you guys that's gonna be really exciting okay can I start learning Python as an absolute beginner from code Academy and YouTube that is a great question in the description below I have my free fiveday Python course if you put in your thing click it and put in your email so for example I'll show you okay clever programmer dotcom slash learn Python if you go here and you put in your name like this and you put in your email address like this and you hit free course it will give you a free Python course that's really really unbelievable that you're gonna enjoy you're gonna get massive value out of this has 40,000 students I think at this point would probably have 80 to 90 plus thousand students who have gone through our free course for Python so definitely go ahead and you in the description below weathering on Facebook or YouTube and sign up for that let's go back here we go cool what else is kind of it's Python simple enough to make a side hustle what do you say my friend come on spit some truth yes yes it is bottle okay I get simple can be okay talk to you talk to us like yes Python definitely cabbies the side hustle but not just because it's simple more just because it's powerful you can do a lot of stuff I mean like a lot of things are simple I don't know why I use that that word something doesn't have to be simple to be a side hustle that's why is it a that was a bit confused but Python definitely side hustle it's not the best phrased question I guess yeah I was confused I was like confused about how he was trying to ask but it's simple enough simple enough as in computer code 15 hours a day for three months but here's what you should do right don't just randomly code if you want to actually start getting freelancing job opportunities don't just start coding randomly here's what I recommend okay what did it go so go to jobs and type in Python and then learn specific skill sets that would is what I would recommend so there's a Django Chuck job available right this is the one we just looked at and this guy wants some basic models made and he needs to use a repo which requires you to learn git and github so I would say go ahead and this is an entry level so this means if you spent two weeks hardcore into learning Python and Django you will be able to get this job for $30 and actually put it on your portfolio that you actually helped somebody do a job and build out your profile on up work you will get a fivestar rating you will get $30 and you are much more likely to then get a bigger job if you need to learn Django I'm making a bunch of stuff on it but you can do Python Django clever programmer and I have a lot of great stuff for Python Django yeah I have a series on this python tutorial 2018 for beginners and you can essentially go through this okay this is gonna help you with your denier go look up the jobs then go learn those skills and then go apply for those jobs okay and that way you are doing you are practicing the correct skills that are currently paying in the job market or you could go to college spend eight years learn a lot of theory and then you go to a job and they actually are doing none of that stuff and there's a new JavaScript framework that's actually doing what you need it to do right so you know don't do that don't become an irrelevant dinosaur because because you know that's what you feel like we makes that noise okay cool so let's hide my slideshow can't show all of it and let's go back okay the heat DBZ says I started learning how much would I have to scroll for this alright I started learning Python a month ago I recently graduated I'm I'm trying to see if I can find it no no hold on that'll be too much mijita Vegeta okay let's answer this one do I need a background in CS or a degree in computer science like a bachelor's undergrad to get an entrylevel job that guy asked about backend but in general to enter the field do I need to showcase projects or cut off cut off the answer is that it is not true anymore in today's world that you need a computer science degree to get a job especially to get an entrylevel job okay it's that's not true anymore so I would not wreck if you want to go and learn theory or you have a very specific reason you want to become a doctor and you want to go to code like a coding school cool if you have extra money and you want to go to coding school cool but if you need to get jobs or you don't want to get freelancing work I don't think it's necessary no it definitely it gives you an edge a little bit I mean like they look you somebody who has a degree over somebody who doesn't but putting four years and all that money into a degree um I feel like you would get the same amount of edge in probably six months or less if you were smart about it like work on a lot of open source projects just find some open source projects on github and go work on them and get some experience because like even for me I already have a Bachelor ISM partway through my master's and no matter what like most positions they want you to have like years of experience was like Oh minimum two years middle and three years of experience before will even like consider hiring you which sucks because I only have like six or eight months of it and so it just wasn't enough but if you have enough like projects in your portfolio and things to back you up and you I guess you kind of say like working on open source project could be considered experience or if you have like some internships or something anything like that that will actually do much better than having a degree so if you can like get your chops up and then like leverage some connections you have ask some people maybe get like the internship try to something for free just to get your experience first that might actually help you a lot more getting an entrylevel job than a than a degree would because they want to see what you have and they want experience and like having a degree late they kind of know it so it's not actual experience so if you can just shortcut that and just get some experience right off the bat that's I sure your best best bet kind of a catch22 because you need experience to get experience but that's why I said you should try to get some free internships to work on some open source projects or something like that and I think that's actually a very very valid um plan of action to take and I kind of wish I did that I didn't know that I just kind of barley took the college route but yeah unless you want to go to something very very specific and be like eh academic in some topic then college is kind of all I feel like it's not worth four years for a degree right not worth four you know and the money you know and another thing is that you need to get smarter about how you're applying to all of these places so for example what I recommend is hit up startup CEOs or people who are like have a startup and send them oneminute personalized video message that I will do the work I'll help you yeah send them a video message use something like drop ler or a service like use loom yeah okay even go to like just a random idea kind of generally related right you could go around to like small businesses and offer to make them websites for free and you can consider that actual experience she's put it on your resume be like oh yeah four six and then go from yeah go from free to actually start charging them be like hey look at what I can do for you give me a week give me a chance and then if you want to work with me cool but like literally send them a personal video screen recording like hey look this is your project it requires you to build this and this here's a blog post that I have built and using news loom you can actually screenshot or screencast what you are showing them on your screen and send a oneminute message right everybody you should apply to you should send them a personalized message and the more personal you can get with a video or with audio the more powerful your outreach is gonna be the more likely you are to actually speak with the person once you're facetoface with a person your chances of landing that job go up by like 300% it's crazy so like a lot of those people were asking like oh we need three years of minimum experience but if I could if I could have just gotten in front of their faces it would have been a lot easier they could I could have been like I only have nine muscle experience but I did this this and this this is my skill set I feel like I'm a good fit here I provide this for the team blah blah blah and that'll actually do you much better because when you're just a resume in the stack if you have a degree in no experience you're not gonna get any more yeah well you need to like really use these soft skills to get in front of people and the best way to do that is actually just go go to places in person like literally like Netflix's across the street and down the street from us we can just walk right in and acts you know be like hey is there somebody out here I can talk to maybe I can work for free or looking for an internship or something like that and just kind of use these I mean like it might not work with Netflix girls are so big but who knows you might get lucky but smaller companies might be easier but the point is just keep trying until you get some experience and you get something you like yeah but Swedes so public tutorials a bit shaky actually says can you help me to point finger to the real life problem which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence so that is a great question here I have something for you guys let me let me show you what I got any Rick and Morty defense oh god I just there we go okay so here's you know you can do a lot with Python but there's something you can't still do with Python which is reversing the back reversing the digits of pi however loose carrion tried all right so let's go back it's pretty funny I guess I mean that what's the word because in the computer you can't have an infinite number so it would still print something so let me show you some examples some fun examples and they could eventually turn into be real life and having a camera that can detect people and what's happening here these machine learning algorithms you know they they have machine learning algorithms in cameras now where it can detect suspicious activity right so how insane is that that's realworld applications right but we got some more realworld applications for you right over here okay so here are some fun ones that we recently came across on reddit so this dude on the right hand side gave an image to the computer and with the Python code what Python did is on the left hand side drew that image using Microsoft Paint that's pretty cool okay next one this guy says he worked on this project and now his thing what it can do is they can do arrow and color detection at the right spot which can be implemented in selfdriving Rover so here is an example of what this guy is talking about so look nothing red and then up red when he turns it to the right it goes right red and when he turns it to the left it goes left red how freaking sick is that right there's a lot you can do with Python now here's some other things that you can also do with Python these might be more obvious to you guys but this was cool to see that somebody did build this so somebody built a pointofsale system in a store so if I go over here you have a pointofsale system you guys are all familiar with this right nothing new here and look at this this is actually built using the tech inter module TK int II Arctic inter module in Python this dude built out the entire GUI he can remove things he has a button that removes items he can open a window to add options I'm getting hungry I'm getting concrete to my freedom system sitting over there all right he has what are the available options can you get coffee what size is hamburgers what sizes can you get them in right so it can do all of these things and then if I go over here this is what it looks like okay whoops so the applications of what you can do are vast it's up to you how you decide to actually use them yeah that's the creative part that's the actual hard part is like here's here's some here are some other examples right remember when I don't know if you ever got checks but when you get checks remember we used to walk to the bank to deposit the cheque well now you can take your cheque and take an image right and your bank will deposit it for you and how it does it is uses something called edge detection right and you you know what I'm talking about when you hover over your camera it edge detects the cheque and it'll automatically submit it yeah yeah you can crop sit it crops it right you can scan your card and it can edge detect that it's a card or it's a credit card and it'll pull out the numbers from there you know what I'm talking about right so you can do all those things that's powered with machine learning right and in artificial intelligence okay what's going on here Google slit a slit 34 says Google also heavily promotes and provides training on progressive web apps which is the best of desktop web app and best of mobile app combined in one awesome mark Austin says very helpful course I use it to get a job yo what that's awesome our course which course would did use profitable programmer to get a job marked and if yes man I want to bring you on to our livestream next tomorrow ok anybody who's in profitable programmer our course a very helpful course I use it to get a job who instances are there any autumn or there any products I can do even though I'm young yeah there are a lot of projects just look them up you go to my youtube ok you that program connect floor there go do that I just gave you one for program connect for it and come back on a future livestream jump in the comment in the what will demo your app or something yeah I just came from a Chicago fullstack Academy session where we discussed this very topic that's awesome my man which very topic because I don't know at this point what they're talking about but fullstack Academy is pretty awesome and no one I don't know if you know Nick drain but Nick drain was my original mentor who actually taught a fullstack Academy I don't know if he still teaches there that insomniac that's that's awesome a man can I learn flutter without feet or did Google ever shut down this project oh we never did there are flutter we're supposed to do so you can learn flutter without fear my friend there is no need for fear to learn flutter like it's pretty simple this shit's pretty basic you don't need to be very smart to be able to learn it you definitely don't need a college degree you can learn flutter any day like blood blood er flutter we don't stutter clutter hater me mother change the shuddered alright cool man that was a nice DJing on our end I'm sure that we should put it probably higher so no don't worry about it man Google is pushing it pretty hard flutters becoming pretty popular it's not going away anywhere well that's what we thought about Google lens yeah tell it vanish Google enter Google glass you'll be fine because the perfect google lens go Google in Google glass yeah the lens Google glass yeah how can I stay on the grind well do stuff that feeds you and surround yourself with people who are passionate and love um you know that's the only way is your environment in your environment about coding you need to put yourself in an environment where you can stay on the ground that's that's literally that's there you find people move get rid of distractions have like code stuff in your room all the time and have your plate just create environment for you where you can drive and if you don't know what that is and you got to figure it out if you can't do that we got to figure out how to do that yeah you going back until you do know how to do something and then just figure it out hi says Kazi let's be honest here you have absolutely no idea how to code let me see let me put the brightness up a little bit here absolutely no idea how to code you're repeating the same stuff every single day and sell BS to the beginners if you want to prove yourself how about coding now a live look dang I think this guy didn't see our our app livestream ah last week right where we coded a full stack when app Craigslist frontend badassery well yeah man you got me man I'm just sitting here I don't know how to code and just spewing stuff but how high if you do get a chance you know what oh I don't know how to code I got something for you watch this hold on we got it hold on hold on I got we are going to be making a Craigslist app clone we're gonna be doing it with Python and Django we're gonna be using beautifulsoup and web scraping and the end result when you type in something like Python tutor it looks like this not very pretty here when you type in a Python tutor like this so which one do you prefer this one or this one I'll explain it as I go I'll put one just so you can get the idea for this what we're using is something called flexbox so I added all of those in none of those refresh now what we need is the search bar value search so now search with the placeholder let's just make sure that it's working let's go Network hit this we can add some dummy images in so we're gonna go here paste it and delete it so now when we go back we refresh we're gonna host it on Heroku asked for if you click into it it'll be $360 app guys is actually live on Heroku all right there we go okay we just coat it right in your face bro right in your face okay cause the REO episode are software developer what software developer anti website developer but most importantly I'm a money developer I focus on making money as a developer Lucy a hot chick developer but I guess yeah yeah money developer there you go okay what if I just know Python as the only programming language watch would I do to get money building projects and solving problems is how you make money it's not related to your programming language it's not related to your ethnicity it's not related to what country you live in it's related to you solving the real problems that exist in the real marketplace next question a 17 late for coding you are give up now yeah we started here six man I started out of the womb why don't my mother's womb you got the laptop came out first yeah look this laptop is actually attached to my body look at look at this it's actually attached to my body nah man you're not late I didn't start coding until I was 18 yeah I started coding when I was like four five years ago so like 20 or 21 something like that literally you're fine man just learn from this guy they're from Austin you'll be good don't learn from my shitty college professor Real Talk videos promoter you're at a good age take advantage of it you're very young you have multiple multiple lifetimes ahead of you I also have multiple lifetimes ahead of me I'm only 25 so if you're 17 you can spend three years learning like one thing get really good at it and keep applying for work and you still have stay close to the money like six months and start applying three to six months in of coding start applying to platforms like wise ant take lessons and up not up work your won't mean you might not be ready for up work at that point maybe you might be but start applying two platforms you can teach other people coding okay so I'm talking about wise ant I'm talking about take lessons okay this is wise ant learn from your tutors from an expert tutor you can be charging like thirty five to fifty dollars an hour here okay between a wise ant and take lessons I was making over eighty thousand dollars a year as a developer okay holy take lessons live the hostess that's pretty cool so yeah take advantage of this applied these types of platforms if you're in a different country and you can't get them well just use an equivalent like people per hour people per hour okay or freelancer calm or fiverr.com use the equivalents and start applying to coding Java and start teaching people how to code who are behind you okay so if somebody is behind you you can teach them how to code and charge them thirty five to fifty dollars an hour or more to help them learn programming okay now we can start learn earning an income and then you can focus going fulltime into coding having a master in computer science will have the same benefit of going to computer science collage yeah I mean it depends what you're trying to do I would say learn on your own don't get into sixty thousand dollars a debt and go to a coding bootcamp instead where it's super focused and they actually help you with job placement and interview skills and all of that that's what I would recommend if you have to spend some money seventeen years early as yep we are gonna make it active but all types of Najma says but if you're in school for computer science definitely work on your own personal projects shout out to all types of Najma from our instagram and she's like if you're in school for she has definitely work on her it looks better on your resident instead of showing your school projects yes yeah please work on your passion projects things that you actually enjoy doing and then build them you know what I mean right because if you just do school projects those projects are not gonna be good and they're not gonna actually help you that much or like find an open source project that you really care about and like put some meaningful work into it and have like tangible results for that that works too so yes do something you care about something that's cool there's so many opensource projects just google it yep there's a lot you can do or start from scratch how many interviews did you do before feeling comfortable okay so that's a good question you just do a lot of interviews and you feel comfortable with the more you do okay livestreams used to freak me out now the more I do them the more I actually enjoy them and I do them interviews now don't freak me out these guys just saw me close a person right now on the phone right I got on another call you guys remember when I was doing a YouTube accelerator program and I sold you know one of my people on it right on the call I'm doing live calls in front of everybody and I'm closing clients between five hundred ten thousand to twenty thousand dollars when we flew to Vegas and we closed the client right so those things aren't happening and there's a lot of pressure than in those situations right there's a lot of tension the number one thing you've got to deal with this pressure and tension if you can hold the pressure in tension that's where you can win if you come in to do a negotiation pressure and tension is what is one of the things that you have to actually be able to withstand so if you come in with like you know what price you want and you want seventyfive thousand dollars from the job and they say you know we can get started for fifty thousand what do you say right max we can do is 50,000 so you want to get started everybody and their mother would probably be like yes right but then that's why it takes you forever to get to 60,000 like four years later you have a $10,000 raise and you're so happy about it when if you just withstood those twenty minutes to zero 20 minutes of pressure you could have changed a huge aspect of your life instead of making 50,000 as a dis offer developer you oughta make and you would have been making $75,000 a software developer so my recommendation for interviews is go to as met fail as many interviews as you possibly humanly can go with the intention to burn out like get destroyed in an interview okay this is the only way you'll move past the fear and you'll actually start improving okay when something is making you afraid go right into it fear is fear nowadays is actually should be your GPS if public speaking scares you do it if interview scare you go do them it's people scare you go do that right so go do the thing that actually scares you is gonna help you out that's how you would improve your interviewing skills as a developer and land jobs Travis is providing values the key for sure you're not late just started at 24 I'm 19 awesome nathan is html/css mandatory to know before learning Python nope they're not okay you can learn them after learning Python cool Guana I'm 15 learning coding that's awesome de varios says yes if you want to be a web dev okay go lay okay their block user a goodbye it's just interesting about your opinion what do you guess about gold Lang is that a great idea it's a great idea to create server with help of go I don't know anything about go so I don't I'm not gonna answer something I don't know about spam scam guys keep it clean I'm just gonna start deleting everyone that's not keeping it clean because I want to make sure that the community is made up of clean people because when you have one toxic person it starts to spread very quickly and that's a last thing we want because what happens with us is then we don't want to do it anymore you know and then you guys don't want to be in the community anymore so let's please focus on keeping it clean maybe some people in here if they want to become moderators they can become moderators and they can kick somebody out and produce panels definitely be your moderator I'm surprised anyone buying into just watch some of these videos the quota says take the courses perhaps Thank You Dakota okay Dakota is actually standing up for us so I really appreciate that Arlen says begin flutter is extremely powerful technology which definitely will be supported by Google yep agreed agreed cool he's just not shelling it for us because most people starting out coding don't know most things about it yes my friend thank you because when we create so here's what's going on right our YouTube channel has been on the decline it's dying we are happy creating technical tutorials but we created one that was three hours long okay one two and three okay three hours long and what ended up happening was it's getting it gets very little views and you get very little I'm also so technical there were actually very few people viewing it more surface level content actually gets more views that's why CSS crash course will get more views and HTML crash course will get more views and so that's where the problem comes in right content creators we can spend a lot of time creating something days weeks that's our livelihood then it gets no results and so we need to create self that's easily digestible for you entertaining for the viewer and at the same time helps our channel survive and not die right because our channel is you know some weird way at the verge of dying which text editor is best when learning to PI to beginning to learn Python so there are a lot of different ones you can use Visual Studio code is definitely my one of my favorite text editors if you want to graduate into becoming a big boy then I recommend using pycharm alright which is not a text editor which is the integrated development environment but it's super powerful it understands a lot about what's happening with your code and it's pretty badass so I recommend using a integrated development environment because what's cool about this is you can set up your virtual environments inside of this you can set up your databases inside of this once you install packages it can understand that for you if you're building a project in Django or JavaScript or whatever it can actually understand how your MVC framework is working it can understand how your model is related to your template and how that are related to your view and you can go in between and it can figure out a lot of things for you such that it's almost like having an intelligent human software developer on your shoulder not just a person who's looking for grammar errors kind of like vs code and how its using the linting and it's like oh the styling is or maybe you should style it like this not those errors this is actually like a intelligent software developer that's sitting hands like buddy buddy buddy buddy listen you're up man do it right you know what I'm saying that's the idea here so let's go back today to the shat as one might say Lord yeah but just standard idle will not be a bad idea but you can also use pie chart from JetBrains yeah there you go somebody answered for you how is Python be t.j.s how is Python beating Jay as though that's a great question so that's not that's not clickbait we actually have a thing whoa what is happening let's go here let me show you we got show me so I got show you what we got so python is beating out JavaScript in the trends over here as you can see right python is eating javascript for breakfast because python is a snake okay Python is Python most what's questions asked Stack Overflow why JavaScript was going down though pythons obviously going up but I'm wondering why javascript is going down right so python has officially overtaken will we ever be able to see this image copy the image address paste on Python is actually beating it out and it's on the upward trend really aggressively so this is what we mean by pythons interests and trends are showing signs of crazy growth as we go forward especially with the machine learning and data machine learning and data science and AI there's a huge market with this stuff okay so actually let's just leave that screen right there in the back so when people also when people join in they can actually see that nothing nice job it's good all right that's pretty cool actually anybody who joins will be like oh that's yeah they're on the graphs yeah Google Trends okay it's a new thing to just love just some specific language to know it's not like you have to learn what the project requires even if it is assembly language okay great point real Islam yeah so yeah again languages don't matter as much you have to see what each project requires okay that's definitely very very important yeah there's no beyond in all programming language like Python is great and very versatile but if you want to do mobile you're not gonna use Python okay do you want to do like operating systemlevel stuff like hyper on steam computing stuff you're not gonna use Python so obviously some jobs are gonna require other languages but python is very good to get a lot of jobs done but obviously there are jobs that yep Python companies and there sometimes you do need assembly that's true but I mean that's only if you want to do assembly job yeah I want to do with sembly jobs I know it's kind of fun sometimes but yeah it's fun for like little big this guy goes to rip h14 w oh yeah yeah all right this the next question I gotta leave after this you guys I have interview four policemen three days I don't have any project what's happening here there's lots of same questions being copied pasted kind of fell behind forty seventeen minutes behind ah okay okay so let's keep going my thoughts exactly I started coding at 32 that's awesome my man yeah so you see it's still young Shafi says can you give me some information about up work I have done a little bit of C++ and C just need some advice to stick to code and improve so what the information I will give you right is similar to what I was saying earlier so if I go to opera calm or sorry here I'll go and I'll type in c plus plus let's see if I get anything for it right so I'll go to jobs and I'll see what kind of jobs are people posting here so if there are any C++ type of jobs then I will recommend you apply for that right seeking C++ developer apply within entrylevel job create a job board scraper and it requires C++ okay so look at upward for what jobs are available and then kind of work your way back to learning those technologies and continuously applying to them and if you can send all of these people a video message that's even better all right I'm a huge believer in video messaging okay let's see what's going on started coding at nineteen one I've given myself one year to become a full stack developer how can I become a pro in that time okay becoming a pro is a matter of how many hours you put in so if you put thousand or more hours you're gonna be pretty damn good so if you're coding ten hours a day five to ten hours a day you are gonna be well on your way to become a pro you'll be pretty damn good where your strengths aren't an income well before one year okay okay that's a family in town so this guy will take care of you mr. Cozzi as he always does peace out thank you for being in the live stream all right Aaron take care you guys yep peace out enjoy family let's be real here I'm learning Python and flutter I haven't seen any language cooler than Python really you guys are great both great tutors this teacher day today in Nepal happy teachers day to the whole team a hell yeah awesome man so that is amazing videos promotor yeah Python and flutter is fun with Python I would created a Django rest framework and then I would actually just code that the app up and flutter and then just combine the two that'd be fun hello bless from Cameroon awesome Java core line is Java core language also required in today's freelance market to be relevant or Python and Django is more than sufficient Java I'm sure you can find freelancing jobs for Java there's no shortage of that Python and Django is something that I personally prefer the reason why I push for Python so much is because of the trend of the data science and machine learning so if you're good with this language and you have your fundamentals strong yo can we not wash anything right now so this guy's like just crazy just washing stuff all the time so if we have pas if you have Python right then in the data science trend is going higher in the data and analytics is going higher I just think it's a great place to be playing at Python is my first language but I left it because school wasn't teaching it a lot of schools are now actually starting to teach Python now I use JavaScript a lot do you suggest I move on or just go with Python if you're using one language already keep going with this for building projects okay if you're stuck in beginner phase still with JavaScript then sure switch to Python so you don't have to deal with all the complexity you can just get to actually building and then you can go back to doing JavaScript what I figured was like some a crazy epiphany that I had was I started actually becoming a lot better than a lot of JavaScript developers by going deep into Python in my early learning stages because nothing got in my way I kept being able to learn things quickly and build things quickly Python never got in my way so I was very productive with my development and I was able to solve difficult problems not get stuck in the syntactical issues not get stuck in the asynchronous programming issues that you'll have with web development some weird esoteric problems I was spending my time fundamentals down so if you're a beginner I would say learn Python to get your fundamentals down and then you can switch to JavaScript right after yeah rick and morty hell yeah hi this is what book should I learned to learn Python a great book that I actually recommend for all of you guys if you go on Amazon's called learn Python by John Zell or not learn Python I'm sorry I'm sorry it's called computer science by Johns L so this is a very very good book that I recommend to every single person even if you're not a Python developer I recommend it it's a great book and it really helps you learn a lot of like programming concepts I don't know it just did the trick for me okay did the trick for me that's all that's all I can say courses in community colleges they started adding them way faster than in universities just because we say that again say it louder so people that want to flatter people that want to start taking Python classes can actually go to community colleges because they're easier they're like wait faster to adapt new technologies compared to universities because they they take too long to take to change curriculums so if you want to take a Python fast like right now you can go to your local community college and actually just you know oh so you can actually take lots of classes with Python from their local community colleges that's amazing yeah so you don't have to you can skip out on the University in that case and just like specialize in Python Zul fee says yo yo what's up people tag everything as scam if they can't do it for sure that's you know definitely true like if people can do it or they can't wrap their mind around you have to put in some kind of box and so they're just like okay we're just gonna call it scam that makes our job a lot easier what are the different types of development of Python like webdirect and ooh with Python right you can do data analysis you could do web development you could do machine learning where you can do like image detection you can detect faces you can detect credit cards you could detect suspicious behavior you could detect moving objects there's a lot of things that you can do in the field of Python okay so I would definitely say that let me see if I can pull up my Instagram video that talks about this cuz it's pretty good and it'll give you guys some insight in a quick fashion into what are some of the things that you can do with Python so I'll put the volume up of it three reasons like you should become a better developer actually down one is more focused on why should I become a web developer let me see if where I have the one which goes three reason why you should learn Python here's here's a good one and refill would you believe it it's actually powered by Python Netflix is power about Python did you know that Netflix was powered by the Python a lot of people don't know that software driven networking is actually a huge thing data analysis software never networking a Python juice take photo block whole stack development do that with a time this is powered by power but I thought Google's YouTube Instagram reddit Dropbox Pinterest Eventbrite and Spotify okay so there you have it those are some of the things you can do with Python hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight into it let us go back and watch our tutorials what do you think is possible to land a job if you only know in the basic fundamentals of Python you have to know more than just the fundamentals you have to know how to problemsolve in coding you have to be able to think at a deeper level and understand what are the actual problems that are trying to solve then you got to be creating a below for the solves the problem okay so it's not just the fundamentals of Python that'll help you get a job you gotta understand how do you actually go about solving somebody's specific problem coding horror I wrote a great blog on like should you learn let me see if I can find it coding horror why don't become a programmer or something like that I think you've wrote something please don't learn to code and he said something really great okay let me find it if we if we don't learn to plum we risk being plumbed ourselves plum bow or be plumped so he says I love programming also love I also believe programming is important in the right context for some people but so are a lot of skills I would no more urge everyone to learn programming then I would urge to learn plumbing right here's the thing that he says about lines of code okay this one this is where I think I got it yeah he goes it's is as soon as a more code in the world is an inherently desirable thing in my 30year career as a programmer I have found this not to be the case should you learn to write code no I can't get behind that you should be learning to write as little code as possible it assumes that coding is the goal software developers tend to be software addicts who think their job is to write code but it's not their job is to solve problems don't celebrate the creation of code celebrate the creation of solutions we have way too many coders addicted to doing just one more line of code already so this is why I say that just the fundamentals of Python aren't gonna help you really understand how to solve problems and then actually try to code it as little as possible and focus on solving the problem learn JavaScript first or framework can you tell about it yep you can do either or just learn job sorry learn JavaScript first get the fundamentals right then learn frameworks on top of it more Rick and Morty Chris says also Charlie says that was a great impression whoo Rick thanks charlie that's awesome today what about data scientists after three years is it still most wanted yes data science is only gonna be growing till now I busted almost 50 times an interview but still not giving up looking for Python job opportunities in Tokyo since January 2019 beautiful keep going Jeep get more intelligent about how you're applying but keep going as of now you should start applying to teaching coding to people on platforms like wise ant and take lessons so you can actually start generating an income from coding as of now you should do whatever he wants man ok should do both do you think a beginner in Python can learn web develop a wet web scraping filing a directories or should you start from the basics first you can learn web scraping filing in directories you should okay here's a real answer learn the basics first learn the fundamentals first so I have my free course in the description below you can actually click on it's a 5 day free Python course it's pretty amazing we have a lot of 70,000 plus students enrolled in it at this point that's gonna teach you a lot of the basics but here's me here's how I'm gonna answer this right if you are somebody who has little motivation you want to do a project to keep you motivated so you don't quit then go and do the directories and filing and direct and web scraping right now follow somebody's tutorial and just do that right now maybe that'll just keep you in the game longer but if you want to do it correctly learn the basics first because when you're doing web scraping right you're gonna need to know how classes and objects work you're gonna need to know how modules work you're gonna need to import beautifulsoup and requests right then you're gonna need to create a request object and a beautiful soup object those require you to actually know how classes and python work then on top of that you're gonna need to build out when you scrape the data you're gonna get back some file type what is that file type ok is it text is a JSON it's really like weird right when you have to drill down into the a tags and the classes and you're drilling down into those elements on a page well how are you gonna deal with that if you don't understand how data structure is like lists and dictionaries work at a pretty deep level so what I will say to you is the correct way is really learn the fundamentals and basics and problem solving first and then go for it but if it means you're gonna quit programming then do the thing that makes it fun for you so you can keep doing it for a long period of time PyCharm can do basic sequel queries for you true okay I can use Python to hack you can use Python to hack for sure concerned citizen says so two days ago I got introduced to you very interested in coding I'm 46 years old I would like to be able to work from home is this possible here's the answer this is very possible that's the short answer the long answer is do it if it excites you and if it interests you because it's hard but it's also very enjoyable okay it's contagious coding it literally feels like playing a video game if you enjoy it okay so if you're 46 you can be spending a lot of hours in a day learning coding and by the time you're 46 and a half or by the time you're 47 you should already be earning an income right so here's how I would lay down the road map for you if I was concerned citizen concerned citizen who is 46 years old and I want to be able to work from home here's exactly what I would do I would start watching tutorials and learning coding at the same time I would be on up work a lot and I would be typing in and looking for any kind of jobs I could apply for write Python related so I'd be looking at seeking web scraping specialists okay so I'd be like cool I'm gonna be working on my web scraping skills because there's a demand for it in the market I'm gonna help working on Django because people are talking about Django cool but in order to be able to do that I'm gonna reverse engineer that and I'm gonna learn the basics of Python first and really get them on point so one once I learn my Python fundamentals two I start moving on to web development okay while you are moving on to learning web development skills here's what I would recommend for your concerned citizens there you go two platforms likewise ant and take lessons comm and you start actually tutoring others in Python and in coding and you should start charging these people thirty five to fifty dollars an hour within a few months of aggressively reaching out to 30 to 50 people a day you should be able to get your income to one to three thousand dollars a month without too much effort once you can do that you're already working from home teaching other people coding you're already making an income you can do online lessons here okay you can do online lessons training people in coding making between 35 to 75 or a hundred dollars an hour depending on your skill the reviews you have the testimonials you have all of those things and then you can go on to start once you know you do that for like six months to a year and then you can go on to just go fulltime on the freelancing okay meaning start applying to lots of friend Lansing opportunities and you can be apply trying to get you know skill your income between one to five thousand dollars extra per month from freelancing job opportunities for Python the best job opportunities you're not gonna find on upwork.com or wherever go to meetups and start going today so you can build and cultivate those relationships in the community use Instagram really intelligently and find other developers and build relationships with them get on calls with them go out and have coffee with them because when you're ready these people will have job opportunities lined up for you for days that is by far the number one way to get job opportunities okay you can use LinkedIn for this and build relationships with software developers you can email developers who work at Google and Netflix and literally ask to speak with them get a coffee with them ask them questions interview them or become their students and there are a lot of developers who would be more than happy to take you on and actually teach you coding even without you having to pay them so you build those relationships and you build your skill at the same time it's almost impossible they're gonna be out of you're not gonna have opportunities you're actually gonna be flooded with the amount of opportunities you're gonna have you're gonna have to turn a lot of these opportunities down okay thanks for considering my point cause II later hey Ron what's the best way to study from a book McCulloch that's a good question best way to study from a book my friend I say is really spend a lot of time coding alongside the book have your computer or laptop or whatever open and be coding the entire time right alongside the book that you are reading consumption should be 15% of your time or 10% of your time creation should be 90 to 85 to 90 percent of your time and then you will do really well in anything especially coding I think your channel is awesome I used flutter and Python two great languages real code that's amazing if you want to teach me flutter because I want to learn flutter that would be amazing how to really appreciate it reach out to me on instagram at clever cause ii okay and just drop it in context what you're doing clever cause he's like spell like that on instagram and i would love to learn flutter okay because i have been spent any time learning it so if somebody knows that in the community just get on a call and teach me and then i can help you with whatever you know getting clients and stuff carlos goes can we not wash anything right now google ever shut down ah there one not shut it down okay I will at some point depending on what the demand there is for it but I think that actually could be a pretty great opportunity Kevin yeah I learned Java after after Python and that really really helped me actually learn Java I learned it a lot faster because of that oh wow I have that book Charlie says that's awesome the Python the computer science by john zell jason says python can create a system like payroll system yep I've actually built a payroll system with Python will I be only building recipe as a Django dev not really but that's part of it I think you should check out and give feedback or promote Python course of best Python course and tutorial on YouTube this guy is amazing check it out I promise you would love it ok is that my course because my once my thing is called best Python course so yeah thank you if that's for me I am working in a tech support but have basic knowledge only in Java can I switch to Python and learn and do project and Python search for a job what do you recommend to me for sure if you already know a programming language guys changing languages is like changing diapers you can change it so fast ok or clothes that's a better example you can learn a language really fast if you know one if you as long as you know the concepts in one so yeah you can switch to Python and search for a job but like you can also just be in Java and search for a job ok you're not Java is not like going anywhere we can we can type in Java here as well right so Java is pretty popular it's right next to all of these it's not going anywhere so if you already know it and if you already enjoy it and there's no reason for you to go and learn Python then don't learn Python but if you want to learn Python then learn it there we go there we go there's no world out there that we I want to make a web application which is based on data science and machine learning so what should I add or merge with Python tensorflow matplotlib or something else yep all of the above so tensorflow I think you would need to add in you would need to add in there's like some other libraries I haven't done too much with machine learning so I'm not gonna steer you wrong but look up some Django tutorials with some kind of machine learning and I bet you'll pull something up dude Django devs also work on views and templates or frontend frameworks have taken over you could do both my friend you could work on views and templates or you can use frontend frameworks as well I mean it's it's really up to you for an and what the project requires but if the project requires like having a really incredible frontend then yeah you're not gonna use Django for your frontend you're gonna use something else but if you're gonna be fine with the project and they don't care as much and it's more just for the internal business then you can use Django and be fine I want to make a decentralized app which requires JavaScript and Python that's great I have a friend his name is he has a channel called DAP University and he teaches you how to do blockchain apps and so he's pretty good for that I would highly recommend actually looking his channel up let's vlog you yesterday coding that's great what do you think about coding boot camps I think that coding boot camps are great you should definitely look into them I think they're great anything that requires intensive learning over a focused period of time that's incredible oh okay it's and things were the answer you got it my man oh yeah I'm gonna think about making a digital course for sure when you think that I shouldn't mention I love to problemsolve and love to learn you know so I got interested that's amazing oh you're gonna if you want to compile that'd be great Kazi is amazing thank you videos promoter diapers well tell that to my oneyearold John Harmon yep you got it I will and also if you're interested in mentoring with me what I help you either with getting clients starting your own business breaking out of your 9 to 5 and having freedom in your life as a developer especially or maybe you want to do some digital marketing stuff honor I would recommend click the in the description below i have a link to sign up for an application where you can work with me as in development or if you want to do something like digital marketing or something too if you fill out that application we'll talk about digital marketing they're totally Wow totally entering yep you got it clever programmer make me fall in love with Python dad is amazing I'm glad that out that was possible thing for me to do okay guys thank you so much for being on here I think this was really really fun we went for one hour and 18 minutes we will be doing a lot more live streams I hope you enjoyed today's show this is cause II Frankie please jump in my man guys this is Frankie he's the guy behind the scenes who makes all of these things happen alright guys this is Frankie what is up people Frankie cover program alright tell us what you do I am the video producer and content producer for a lot of things Instagram YouTube and a couple of courses right AWP with Aaron that was us team working yeah but thank you guys for joining if you guys want to work more with causing the mentoring program is really amazing we actually brought a lot of people about two weeks ago people from all over the fool who is watching he's from Hong Kong some people from from New Mexico so people from San Francisco it was I was kind of like a master class mastermind type of thing we had a student come in to Hollywood from Florida as well exactly it was fun so you know Kazi here does great work we'd be happy to actually teach you what we know and yeah thank you guys yeah and drop some of our business knowledge on your face have fun at the same time yeah it's kind of what we do Wow all right guys thank you so much we love your face this is cozy and this is Frankie and we'll see you in the next video not stop
