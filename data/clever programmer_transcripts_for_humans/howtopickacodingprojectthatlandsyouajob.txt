With timestamps:

00:01 - - So the question is,
I want to start coding
00:05 - but I don't want to waste
time on doing something
00:08 - that won't get me a job.
00:10 - This my friend is what I
call 'Analysis Paralysis'.
00:15 - This was a question I
got on one of my recent
00:17 - YouTube videos, and it makes
me go crazy, this type of stuff
00:22 - but this type of stuff is what
99% of the world deal with.
00:25 - And what I wanna tell
you on that is you would
00:27 - much rather make the wrong decision,
00:32 - and get started
00:33 - than make the right decision
00:35 - but wait for a really long time.
00:37 - You see, life is made
up of not one decision
00:40 - but the sum of all of
your decisions, combined.
00:44 - The only way to improve
your decision making ability
00:48 - and the path you choose, is
through making decisions.
00:52 - Just the same way that I got
better at public speaking
00:56 - or making videos, or programing.
00:59 - You want to get better at
whatever it is that you're doing
01:02 - by doing it a lot.
01:03 - I like to say, the only way
to get to quality is quantity.
01:08 - And this is a concept I
actually call 'Quan-lity'.
01:13 - And what this essentially means is,
01:15 - do a lot of what you're doing
01:17 - and then you're gonna start improving it.
01:19 - The only way to get to
quality is through quantity.
01:23 - The only way is through.
01:25 - When I am faced with a problem,
01:27 - lets say public speaking.
01:28 - The way I get better at
it's by doing a lot of it.
01:31 - Whether its making videos or
maybe I wanna improve in coding
01:34 - the only that is happen is
through me coding a lot.
01:37 - Me making a lot of (mumbles)
commits on my GitHub.
01:40 - Everyday putting in the time,
the effort and the energy
01:43 - to do that.
01:44 - So for you, what I recommend,
is see life is a sum
01:49 - of all of your decisions,
not just a few decisions
01:52 - and your only way to
improve (mumbles) quality
01:53 - of your decisions is through
making lots of decisions.
01:56 - The only way I improve
through programming is
01:58 - through making tons of
mistakes and failing fast.
02:02 - Now I know more than a
lot of people, is exactly
02:05 - what will be wrong with my code,
02:07 - if I do things a certain way.
02:09 - That actually helps me
become a better programmer.
02:11 - The same thing comes to
making decisions in life.
02:14 - You would rather make wrong
decisions really, really fast
02:18 - make lots of them, then you're
ability to make decision
02:23 - will improve, your quality
of decisions will improve
02:26 - and by you making tons of
decisions, you will cut down
02:29 - your decision making abilities
time from a decade to a year.
02:33 - You will be as killed at making decisions
02:35 - as you would be if you waited
10 years to make a decision.
02:40 - I'll give you, a analogy.
02:42 - Most people think if they
just think long enough
02:44 - they'll come up with a right solution.
02:46 - Absolutely fucking wrong!
02:49 - Where this became very
clear for me, was in chess.
02:52 - Chess is not a physical
sport, chess is a mental sport
02:56 - and chess is all about
having perfect information.
03:00 - There's 16 pieces that I
have, there's 16 that you have
03:03 - and we both have perfect information.
03:05 - Meaning that every single move,
its 100% possible (chuckles)
03:10 - that you can make the best
move in every position
03:13 - because you have perfect information.
03:14 - You could look at it, you
could take one day to think
03:17 - about your next move,
you could take two days,
03:19 - you could take five days, 50
hours, you could take a month
03:23 - a year, or five years.
03:24 - But, the interesting thing
is, that you will still
03:28 - not make the best moves every move.
03:31 - Even if you took one
to two years per move.
03:34 - This is when you realize, that
you're not hindered by time.
03:39 - Time is not what will help you improve.
03:41 - You have to play more chess
games, you have to learn more
03:44 - about chess to actually improve.
03:47 - Then, even in the future,
even in five minutes
03:50 - you could find a pretty good quality move.
03:51 - Grandmasters can find way
better moves than you can
03:54 - in probably 20 seconds
, than even if you spent
03:57 - a month on a move, to figure it out.
04:00 - With that said, the same
applies to your real life.
04:04 - If you don't make a lot of
decisions, you don't fuck up
04:07 - in coding and programming
a lot, really, really fast
04:11 - you're gonna be stuck at
exactly where you're at
04:14 - and this is the concept
of 'Analysis Paralysis'.
04:17 - Most people either stuck
in coding and not improving
04:19 - is 'cause they're trying to
find the perfect resource,
04:21 - the prefect tutorial, the perfect
guide, the perfect project
04:27 - the perfect place to
apply, whatever it may be
04:30 - and that's why they either never improve,
04:31 - they never get a job,
they never get a client
04:33 - because they haven't even
take those fucking shots!
04:38 - Its one thing to take a
shot, and then miss it
04:42 - versus never taking a shot, then you have
04:44 - a hundred percent chance of missing it.
04:45 - Forget about this bullshit
of making the best decision
04:48 - or there's a best coding
project, or there is a best way
04:51 - to not waste time coding.
04:55 - What else are you gonna be doing anyway?
04:56 - You're gonna be wasting
time doing something
04:57 - also stupid.
04:58 - Might as well waste time while
coding, working on a project
05:02 - you'd think is not
correct, then finding out
05:05 - why it wasn't correct
a few days into it it
05:08 - or a few weeks into it, then
course, correct and move on.
05:12 - But you have to make wrong
decisions really, really fast.
05:15 - This year, the clever
programmer business is gonna
05:17 - grow like crazy!
05:19 - The audience is gonna grow like
crazy because you know why?
05:22 - In 2018 I tried to be a
big time perfectionist,
05:25 - plan everything out, make it
so planned out and everything.
05:28 - And that I realized is that,
05:30 - that's actually slowing us down.
05:31 - So this year ...
05:32 - 'Cause I was like, what is
gonna be the perfect course
05:35 - that I can make for everybody?
05:36 - Now I don't care about
perfect, I'm gonna keep making
05:40 - what I believe in and I'll keep going,
05:42 - and I'll keep failing fucking fast.
05:44 - I'll fail faster than almost
anybody, which will make
05:47 - this company 'Clever
Programmer' grow a lot faster
05:49 - than everybody else (mumbles) too.
05:50 - Its gonna make the subscribers grow more,
05:53 - its gonna help you more,
and its gonna allow
05:55 - the business to grow faster.
05:57 - We're gonna produce more
courses than we've ever had
06:00 - we're gonna produce more video
than we (mumbles) ever had
06:02 - and we're just gonna be
stronger and winners!
06:07 - Even in the last few weeks,
06:08 - we've been getting incredible
results, by students
06:10 - and they're hitting us up and they're like
06:11 - "We're winning, we're
winning. We're winning!"
06:13 - Ant those are the action takers we need.
06:16 - Jubara Abdullah messages me, he's like,
06:18 - "you're changing my life, I'm
getting high level mentorship
06:21 - from your earn 1K program
and I did not even think
06:24 - this was possible."
06:25 - I'm surrounded by fucking
geniuses, so he's getting a win.
06:28 - (mumbles) Getting a win.
06:29 - This one girl, her name is
Hager Mahmoud I believe,
06:33 - I hope I didn't butcher it.
06:34 - But she's on her Instagram,
we'll put her link here
06:37 - or whatever, you can
check out her profile.
06:38 - But she's been doing a coding
challenge, she's on day five
06:42 - and she's doing a double 39
day challenge, which means
06:44 - she's doing (mumbles) exercise,
everyday and she is coding
06:47 - every single day.
06:50 - And she's currently on day
five, tomorrow will be day six.
06:52 - (weights dropped) Everyday I go to her IG
06:54 - and when she posts that she
did it, I go and support her
06:57 - I tag some of my teammates,
like Rachel or Frankie or Aron
07:00 - in the post and (mumbles)
we all push her and hold her
07:03 - accountable to these results.
07:04 - Those are the winners and
action takers we want to build
07:08 - at Clever Programmer, we
want to be surrounded by
07:12 - and that we want to become.
07:14 - You need to become a action taker,
07:15 - quit dilly-dallying and
thinking ... there is a best
07:19 - way to go about something.
07:20 - There is no best way,
just do the wrong way
07:22 - as fast as possible.
07:24 - And that's really what's exciting, right?
07:25 - Because if you knew in the
ending, it would not be fun.
07:28 - Its like knowing the ending to a movie.
07:30 - You wanna go down a
path, maybe a dark path,
07:32 - maybe a path, a road, not traveled enough,
07:35 - go and discover it, figure
it out, see what's going on.
07:37 - And then comeback, lesson
learned, improve from there.
07:41 - So don't be scared of wasting
time, just get in there
07:44 - start coding today, and actually join us
07:45 - in the 30 day challenge of Instagram.
07:48 - And you can actually put me
in your story, make a story,
07:51 - you code, take a picture of
it from your Instagram story,
07:53 - tag me @cleverqazi.
07:55 - Say something like "30
day coding challenge"
07:57 - I'll blast you on my story,
I'll probably put you
07:59 - on this YouTube channel as well but
08:01 - lets put the Instagram
thing right over here
08:02 - @cleverqazi
08:05 - And this way you could
hold yourself accountable
08:06 - and actually get shit done, become a part
08:09 - of all of the action takers.
08:12 - That's what I want for
you, I love your face.
08:13 - As always, this is Qazi and I'll see 'you'
08:16 - in the next video
08:18 - (punching speed bag)
08:21 - (Hip Hip music)

Cleaned transcript:

So the question is, I want to start coding but I don't want to waste time on doing something that won't get me a job. This my friend is what I call 'Analysis Paralysis'. This was a question I got on one of my recent YouTube videos, and it makes me go crazy, this type of stuff but this type of stuff is what 99% of the world deal with.
