00:00 - is free code Camp worth it I came across
00:04 - an interesting video that I'm actually
00:05 - watching right now and I will break this
00:07 - down with you live and I'm going to have
00:09 - a lot of thoughts on it and this
00:10 - gentleman uh is also going to have lots
00:12 - of thoughts on it so let's go I say
00:15 - extrem is critical um of it and but I I
00:18 - want to back it up um so this all right
00:21 - so he's about to drop some critical
00:22 - facts on free code Camp let's get into
00:24 - it so there's a bit where he kind of
00:26 - rambles on for a while but his point was
00:28 - that he took 45 students that were his
00:31 - through free code camp and this is what
00:35 - he says their skills were like after he
00:37 - put his students through that course so
00:39 - I want you to just hear it yourself uh
00:42 - in my experience more education tools
00:45 - suck they totally suck and they don't
00:48 - teach you actual skills they teach you
00:50 - the theory or they get you to do a thing
00:52 - but they they didn't even know what
00:53 - index on HTML I'm not even kidding my
00:55 - friends my friends I am not making this
00:56 - up so that's pretty frustrating but it
00:59 - makes sense if you only learn on free
01:00 - code Camp you haven't even created a
01:03 - HTML file you don't know where it on
01:05 - your computer it goes so those things I
01:07 - do agree with let's keep hearing him and
01:08 - then I'll share more of my thoughts
01:11 - later not none of these people none of
01:14 - these people knew what to name the file
01:16 - they didn't even know what the file was
01:18 - or where it would go or why is it ending
01:20 - with HTML they may have known one or two
01:22 - or three or the tags that was in this
01:25 - was in
01:26 - 2019 that was in
01:28 - 2019 yep
01:31 - they was set up to go do this and then
01:32 - do this and then do this and all of the
01:34 - online for Education things like the
01:35 - gamified education and there's a bun I'm
01:37 - not even going to say there's a bunch of
01:38 - gamified Education right now regarding
01:40 - these kinds of things and the thing I
01:41 - worry about the most um is if someone's
01:43 - going to finish enough to do the thing
01:44 - another good example is vim Adventures
01:45 - Vim adventurers teaches you how to win
01:47 - the game so a couple of things I agree
01:50 - with him couple of things I don't agree
01:52 - with him he kind of gives me like
01:55 - the professor who's like kind of
01:58 - isolated himself under a rock type of
02:00 - Vibes like I understand his point
02:03 - of there's some parts I skipped but in
02:06 - the video you know if you watch it
02:07 - yourself he talks about like kind of
02:09 - memorizing certain things and and really
02:12 - understanding them so how does the
02:13 - structure of the HTML page work like the
02:15 - body and then the tags and where the
02:17 - head tag goes and script tag and um
02:21 - Etc but there are Parts where he's
02:23 - talking about gamification and I do
02:24 - think gamification is important and I do
02:26 - think those coding environments are
02:28 - important and code academy you know he
02:32 - he takes a stab at code academy and he
02:33 - took a stab at free code camp and my
02:36 - argument would be this did it help more
02:38 - people than it hurt that's one question
02:40 - the other question is if these tools
02:42 - didn't exist would there be more
02:43 - developers today or less developers
02:45 - today that would be another question and
02:47 - so when you look at it as a net was it a
02:49 - net positive or a net negative I would
02:52 - argue very strongly that it's a net
02:54 - positive now is everybody coming out
02:57 - like ninja [ __ ] Warrior level
02:59 - Developers black belts out of this no
03:02 - and does that also make sense where he's
03:04 - like they don't even know how to set up
03:06 - their own HTML files yes most likely but
03:09 - I'll also tell you this take somebody
03:11 - like my brother who has no interest in
03:13 - coding if I started having him set up an
03:15 - HTML file and then he had a Windows
03:17 - computer versus a Mac computer versus a
03:19 - Chromebook and he couldn't follow the
03:21 - tutorial or whatever if he's already
03:23 - scared of numbers and math stuff and
03:26 - he's a very creative smart person by the
03:28 - way I mean he has been doing a very high
03:29 - paying job for a very long time in a
03:31 - creative sector and but you know
03:34 - programming is not really his cup of tea
03:36 - so if I'm showing him that and he's
03:38 - doing that and he can't follow along he
03:39 - will just quit he will not want to do it
03:42 - you understand what I'm saying like he
03:43 - will not want to code whereas when I put
03:46 - him on something like code academy free
03:48 - code camp or you know any of these
03:50 - online for Education tools that he he's
03:52 - bashing
03:53 - on he will just continuously write the
03:56 - thing that they're telling him he'll
03:57 - make progress he'll feel like he's
03:59 - moving forward the gamification actually
04:01 - makes it fun a funny example my
04:03 - ex-girlfriend was a pro boxer a pro
04:06 - synchronized swimmer and just like a uh
04:09 - an athlete an Olympic level athlete her
04:11 - whole life now when I was teaching her
04:13 - coding when I was trying to teach her
04:14 - normally she was like she hated that
04:16 - right but then I found this game called
04:18 - code
04:20 - combat and code combat is basically and
04:24 - how I got her into it was I showed her
04:27 - code combat and code combat is a gam
04:31 - it's a game a video game based on with
04:34 - coding and so you know if there's an
04:36 - enemy you would say if enemy then attack
04:41 - and so she would write that and then she
04:43 - would attack the enemy and she would
04:45 - pick her syntax was whether it was
04:46 - JavaScript or python so the difference
04:48 - would be in Python she would use Whit
04:50 - spacing and indentation whereas in
04:53 - JavaScript she would do the semicolon
04:55 - and the closed pen and open pen and
04:57 - squigglies and
04:59 - and she started actually picking up
05:02 - programming that way because she was
05:03 - just solving puzzles and it was fun and
05:06 - she was starting to understand the
05:07 - logical part of how programming works
05:09 - and then later we could slowly start
05:12 - once her level of interest and
05:13 - excitement hers or my brothers is
05:15 - increased right take the average
05:17 - population not everybody's a hardcore
05:19 - wannabe programmer and just love
05:21 - everything about it once that starts to
05:23 - get increased then you start to
05:24 - incrementally introduce more and more
05:27 - complexity so like this guy is testing
05:29 - them for [ __ ] wrong things like if
05:31 - you're coming off of purely the
05:33 - simulation world like free code camp or
05:36 - whatever of course you're not going to
05:37 - know how to make a file on your computer
05:39 - cuz they've not done that so what is he
05:41 - getting out of testing that of course
05:44 - you're not going to know how to do that
05:45 - then you need an additional resource
05:47 - that then teaches you hey here's how you
05:50 - make a file on your computer here's how
05:52 - you do
05:53 - XYZ um and I also I want to hear him out
05:57 - but I also don't know what his like
05:59 - argument will be but you know just by
06:02 - feeling his vibe off of this video I
06:04 - feel like his argument would be like
06:06 - just shut everything out and uh you know
06:10 - uh live under a rock and just forget
06:12 - about these online simulations memorize
06:14 - code because that's what actually takes
06:16 - you to the next [ __ ] level I don't
06:17 - know I'm going to hear him out but I
06:21 - feel like if he had where I would be
06:23 - less pissed off because the reason why
06:25 - I'm pissed off is cuz
06:27 - like I want more people to learn and I
06:29 - want learning to become easier it's
06:31 - because of professors like these that
06:33 - try to make it hard just for the sake of
06:35 - it being
06:36 - hard and make the experience more on
06:39 - memorization which is a word that was
06:40 - used in the video it took out the fun of
06:44 - coding for people like me I didn't want
06:47 - to code for those reasons I wanted to do
06:49 - it because it was fun I was solving new
06:51 - problems and that was exciting it wasn't
06:53 - because here's how you make an exact
06:54 - HTML file and if you don't put HTML and
06:57 - you put hmtl the file breaks that stuff
07:01 - I learned later and I cared about all
07:03 - the technical stuff
07:04 - later using the command line to then
07:07 - make a file and touch a file and Etc and
07:09 - whatnot learning how to use Vim all
07:12 - those things I honestly cared about
07:13 - later once I discovered that programming
07:16 - was something even fun that I would I
07:17 - would even want to do so I did learn
07:19 - from corsera and Udacity and a lot of
07:22 - their platforms were just online
07:24 - education platforms and I did problem
07:26 - solve right within there but I still
07:28 - improved my problem solving skills and
07:29 - I'm badass today at programming but
07:32 - let's keep going I want to hear the
07:33 - gentleman out fully Adventures it
07:35 - doesn't teach you MIM and kids that had
07:37 - gone through Vim Adventures did not know
07:39 - how to edit a file using Vim in the
07:40 - terminal they had no idea because they
07:41 - never Associated the act of editing a
07:43 - file with the keystrokes that were
07:45 - happening from Bim adventures and the
07:46 - idea the idea the hypothesis behind a
07:48 - thing like Bim Adventures is oh these
07:49 - kids are going to master all these
07:50 - really great you know command line
07:51 - things the problem is that's not how
07:52 - your brain works your brain works by
07:54 - associating the task at hand with what
07:55 - you seeing that means you're looking at
07:56 - a terminal and you have a text file that
07:58 - needs to be edited what are the command
08:00 - okay so some points of agreement that I
08:02 - want to say there yes you're right if
08:04 - you are
08:05 - not using Vim on your command line
08:09 - you're not actually going to learn how
08:10 - to use it from playing that game I
08:13 - understand that that's a good point but
08:16 - here's what I will tell you the first
08:18 - time I was fascinated by vim and that
08:20 - made me want to learn Vim was because
08:23 - somebody sat me down I was at
08:26 - a co-working spot in Chicago it's called
08:28 - pumping St 1 PS1 I don't know if it
08:31 - still exists today or not great
08:33 - co-working spot and when I was there
08:35 - there was somebody that met me and was
08:36 - like yo you should learn them he was a
08:39 - senior developer he's like he going to
08:40 - Skyrock your ability Etc I thought I
08:42 - thought that was freaking cool I'm like
08:43 - I want to learn it so he brought me
08:46 - aside and he said I want you to learn
08:48 - Vim but check out this Vim Adventures
08:50 - play it for a day and then talk to me
08:52 - tomorrow and I just played Vim
08:53 - Adventures for a day and it was how to
08:56 - move my character with like a jkl
09:00 - um and or jkl sorry like how to move my
09:02 - character and basically just moving up
09:04 - and down left and right and Vim has its
09:07 - own set of um keys right how you move
09:10 - around and um I learned how to use move
09:13 - my character in that game and once I did
09:16 - I actually learned how to move around um
09:19 - and got comfortable with those
09:20 - keys then when I moved to an actual
09:24 - Visual Studio code it didn't translate
09:26 - over perfectly but one I was already
09:28 - introduced to the concept of how to move
09:30 - up down left and right without having to
09:32 - use arrows or something else uh the
09:34 - second thing I was already introduced to
09:36 - was like the fun aspect of it I was like
09:37 - this is actually fun I remember playing
09:39 - a game so I had positive emotions
09:41 - associated with Vim so before teaching
09:44 - and somebody learning something they
09:45 - have to be sold on learning that thing
09:47 - they have to actually want to do that
09:49 - thing so the first step to learning is
09:51 - building a desire you can't just start
09:53 - learning stuff that you don't have
09:54 - desire for and if you do it's a weak
09:56 - Foundation eventually you'll quit and
09:58 - you won't want to do that thing okay so
10:01 - that's an important thing to understand
10:03 - so when I'm learning vim and Vim
10:05 - Adventures while you're right it doesn't
10:08 - translate over one to
10:10 - one the first step you're actually doing
10:12 - with that is building the desire and the
10:14 - excitement for somebody and then you
10:16 - move them over into the command line the
10:19 - dark side of the you know the the
10:21 - programming world and then you you sneak
10:24 - them in it's kind of like if I was to
10:25 - introduce you to anime I won't be like
10:28 - bro let's sit down and watch parasite or
10:31 - some one of those crazy animes with like
10:33 - 15 freaking Seasons right code gas with
10:36 - like nine Seasons or whatnot the first
10:38 - thing I would do is be like let's watch
10:42 - uh Death Note you know let's watch like
10:44 - one of those mainstream anime so you can
10:46 - just kind of get into it Attack on
10:48 - Titans maybe and then you start watching
10:51 - like the crazier
10:53 - stuff so that's the way I think about it
10:57 - your fingers become associated with the
10:58 - movements and stuff to do that and that
11:00 - is exactly the same thing for web
11:01 - development if they had learned how to
11:03 - make a very simple web page and if I had
11:05 - walked them through using vs code or
11:06 - whatever to make an actual web page the
11:07 - same way an actual professional
11:08 - developer would do it then they would be
11:10 - building on actual skills using real
11:12 - tools and I cannot overstate how
11:14 - valuable that is because even if you
11:16 - learn the skill completely and you're
11:18 - doing it in the cloud on some
11:19 - educational website and you're not
11:20 - actually logging into a system where
11:22 - every single thing is the same then the
11:23 - pneumatic path the pneumatic yes that I
11:27 - agree with um I'm sorry I yeah sharing
11:29 - the screen okay good that I agree with
11:32 - yes if you don't do it in Visual Studio
11:34 - code at some point you know you have to
11:35 - switch over at some point and if you're
11:37 - not doing it at any point then yes those
11:39 - Pathways won't exist and you will be
11:41 - very confused when you actually go to
11:42 - the real grow so I 100% agree with that
11:44 - Pathways in your brain the neural
11:46 - Pathways and the neumatic uh pneumonic
11:47 - methods and stuff like that they're not
11:48 - going to work because your your brain is
11:50 - is used to associating all of this stuff
11:52 - the entire experience it's not just
11:54 - about knowing how to do X and Y command
11:56 - it's about having all the pieces be in
11:58 - sync so that when when you are put in a
11:59 - similar situation things there are a
12:01 - couple of areas where I've seen it more
12:02 - productive than others for example um
12:03 - code combat
12:05 - uh nice okay we agree on the code combat
12:08 - one that was something I was talking
12:10 - about earlier so thank you for bringing
12:11 - that up yes it is effective on the code
12:14 - combat and we are in agreement there
12:16 - that's cool that because they were doing
12:18 - coding and they had you know the actual
12:19 - syntax of the code that they were
12:20 - writing um you know they got they got
12:21 - better at writing that syntax but but
12:23 - they weren't solving real world problems
12:24 - they were solving you know a problem to
12:25 - help them beat beat the the monster so
12:27 - maybe correct that's true learn how to
12:28 - do recursion or something but it wasn't
12:30 - as effective in my opinion had they been
12:33 - you know solving their own problems I
12:34 - want to make a story game I want to make
12:36 - a something that accomplishes a
12:37 - particular goal of mine and and I agree
12:40 - with that too H if you associate it with
12:42 - your own problem you will learn more you
12:44 - will learn
12:46 - faster and you will retain the knowledge
12:50 - way more because it will be emotionally
12:52 - connected now with that said playing it
12:54 - as a game is the next closest thing to
12:57 - that because on one end you have a
13:00 - teacher handing you down a task and you
13:02 - have to do and that's one extreme of
13:04 - like you're forced to do
13:07 - something on the other end you have the
13:10 - Other Extreme which is you figuring out
13:12 - your own goal and your own desire so
13:14 - these are two extremes okay uh the
13:17 - teacher extreme is like you're feeling
13:19 - like you're forced to do stuff doesn't
13:20 - really feel good and then your extreme
13:22 - is the one that feels the best cuz you
13:23 - feel like you're coming up with it but
13:25 - it's really hard to come up with
13:26 - something in between that is something
13:29 - that makes it fun it feels like a game
13:31 - and you do it so when you're playing
13:33 - heads up with your friends imagine how
13:35 - motivated you are or when you're playing
13:37 - charades or when you're playing
13:38 - something like draw something and one
13:40 - person draws and the other person
13:41 - guesses what that thing
13:43 - is even though it's not a thing you came
13:46 - up with yourself you're very excited to
13:48 - play that game because of how that game
13:50 - works and it's giving you very
13:51 - interesting things to play off of so
13:53 - you're very motivated so I would say
13:56 - that it's better than learning in class
13:57 - because even the game gives you a task
14:00 - like hey defeat this enemy you're
14:02 - actually pretty motivated to defeat that
14:03 - enemy cuz you're like that is kind of
14:05 - aligned with my goal so it does build
14:08 - like an emotional connection though the
14:10 - strongest one would be if you fully came
14:11 - up with your own problem to solve and
14:14 - that just it's just much more visceral
14:15 - it's much more real it just tends to
14:16 - stick better so that's the end of the
14:17 - video really um I it's not to throw
14:19 - freeo Camp under the bus I understand
14:20 - that they've changed a lot but um the
14:21 - takeaway was I sent 45 people through
14:23 - free C Camp and only two of them could
14:24 - build a website afterwards a web page
14:25 - and those two had already learned how to
14:26 - do it before that that's the
14:30 - I don't know why you sound so defeated
14:32 - bro when you say that and the reason why
14:34 - I say that is because they're not
14:36 - supposed to have learned that like that
14:39 - is crazy that's like if I was like okay
14:43 - I want you to become a better
14:45 - fighter and I'm like but first you need
14:47 - to get your Jabs right so then I trained
14:50 - him I took him let's say I take you okay
14:54 - um and I'm like come on here you can
14:56 - leave your hoodie on cuz you already
14:57 - look so badass and I'm sure you're going
14:59 - to be good at fighting I put a punching
15:01 - bag in front of you and then I'm like
15:03 - okay throw your jab and throw your so
15:04 - you start throwing your Jabs and you
15:06 - start throwing your hooks like okay cool
15:09 - and I have you just train that for like
15:11 - two weeks 3 weeks four weeks and then
15:15 - the next day I just go all right son uh
15:18 - put on your gloves I'm going to put on
15:20 - my gloves let's Spar or I bring another
15:22 - fighter and I go okay you guys just Spar
15:25 - bro what do you think is going to happen
15:26 - you're going to get [ __ ] knocked on
15:27 - your ass you're going to gas out you're
15:31 - not even going to last a minute but are
15:33 - you going to be like I didn't get better
15:35 - at boxing no but you just didn't train
15:38 - for that environment so how do you
15:40 - expect to survive in the real
15:41 - environment but
15:43 - also you need to hit the bags too to
15:46 - actually improve your skill set to
15:48 - improve how you fight you can't not do
15:51 - bag work and so when you're looking at
15:54 - free code camp and other online
15:56 - resources they're very helpful cuz they
15:58 - strip away a lot out of the sparring
16:00 - right cuz in sparring I got to put my um
16:04 - the the I forget what what it's called
16:06 - but like the teeth thing we put right so
16:08 - you got to protect your teeth you got to
16:10 - put your head gear you got to put your
16:12 - gloves you got to wrap and you got to
16:15 - like you got to do all these things you
16:17 - got to warm up beforehand you can get
16:19 - too tired so there's a lot of this extra
16:21 - stuff so when you're coding on your own
16:23 - environment you got to set up your
16:24 - coding project you got to set up your
16:26 - folder structures you got to like set up
16:28 - whereas like if you're like dude I just
16:30 - want to solve a particular problem you
16:33 - free code Cam and these they just get
16:34 - you into the meat and potato of the
16:36 - problem so think of that as like hitting
16:39 - the bags or improving in chess for
16:41 - example right like I play chess I'm top
16:44 - 1% in chess and how I got good at it is
16:46 - by playing it of course and get and
16:49 - feedback over my games but I also got
16:51 - better because I do chess puzzles and so
16:53 - chess puzzles are like somebody else's
16:55 - game I solve that situation and then I
16:58 - just move on and sometimes it's not even
16:59 - somebody else's game and that pattern
17:02 - recognition comes into my own games and
17:05 - it helps me and then I can solve those
17:07 - tactics and like have a crushing
17:08 - combination that I can find because I I
17:10 - had done all these tactics beforehand
17:13 - that's how I think of like these online
17:15 - tools they're like helping you solve
17:16 - these tactics and they might not carry
17:19 - over 100% to the full game but these
17:22 - patterns do come into play so testing
17:25 - them on how to make a file and how to
17:27 - set up a folder structure when they did
17:29 - that zero times cuz they did free code
17:30 - Camp I think it's testing for the wrong
17:32 - thing but once the file structure is set
17:34 - up and once it start coding and once
17:36 - there is stuff and they have to add
17:38 - stuff or remove stuff or change stuff
17:40 - stuff that they have learned I bet you
17:42 - that that will still kick in and they'll
17:44 - still be able to do those things so
17:46 - those are just my thoughts I thought it
17:48 - was very entertaining I loved everything
17:50 - you said um even with the things I
17:53 - disagreed I respectfully disagree and uh
17:57 - the things that I agreed you know um I
17:59 - 100% agree so you know if you watched it
18:02 - would love to even have a chat with you
18:03 - you know comment on it but yeah guys
18:05 - thank you so much for watching I
18:06 - appreciate you like the video subscribe
18:08 - to the channel and with that said I love
18:09 - your beautiful face this is ky and I'll
18:11 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

is free code Camp worth it I came across an interesting video that I'm actually watching right now and I will break this down with you live and I'm going to have a lot of thoughts on it and this gentleman uh is also going to have lots of thoughts on it so let's go I say extrem is critical um of it and but I I want to back it up um so this all right so he's about to drop some critical facts on free code Camp let's get into it so there's a bit where he kind of rambles on for a while but his point was that he took 45 students that were his through free code camp and this is what he says their skills were like after he put his students through that course so I want you to just hear it yourself uh in my experience more education tools suck they totally suck and they don't teach you actual skills they teach you the theory or they get you to do a thing but they they didn't even know what index on HTML I'm not even kidding my friends my friends I am not making this up so that's pretty frustrating but it makes sense if you only learn on free code Camp you haven't even created a HTML file you don't know where it on your computer it goes so those things I do agree with let's keep hearing him and then I'll share more of my thoughts later not none of these people none of these people knew what to name the file they didn't even know what the file was or where it would go or why is it ending with HTML they may have known one or two or three or the tags that was in this was in 2019 that was in 2019 yep they was set up to go do this and then do this and then do this and all of the online for Education things like the gamified education and there's a bun I'm not even going to say there's a bunch of gamified Education right now regarding these kinds of things and the thing I worry about the most um is if someone's going to finish enough to do the thing another good example is vim Adventures Vim adventurers teaches you how to win the game so a couple of things I agree with him couple of things I don't agree with him he kind of gives me like the professor who's like kind of isolated himself under a rock type of Vibes like I understand his point of there's some parts I skipped but in the video you know if you watch it yourself he talks about like kind of memorizing certain things and and really understanding them so how does the structure of the HTML page work like the body and then the tags and where the head tag goes and script tag and um Etc but there are Parts where he's talking about gamification and I do think gamification is important and I do think those coding environments are important and code academy you know he he takes a stab at code academy and he took a stab at free code camp and my argument would be this did it help more people than it hurt that's one question the other question is if these tools didn't exist would there be more developers today or less developers today that would be another question and so when you look at it as a net was it a net positive or a net negative I would argue very strongly that it's a net positive now is everybody coming out like ninja [ __ ] Warrior level Developers black belts out of this no and does that also make sense where he's like they don't even know how to set up their own HTML files yes most likely but I'll also tell you this take somebody like my brother who has no interest in coding if I started having him set up an HTML file and then he had a Windows computer versus a Mac computer versus a Chromebook and he couldn't follow the tutorial or whatever if he's already scared of numbers and math stuff and he's a very creative smart person by the way I mean he has been doing a very high paying job for a very long time in a creative sector and but you know programming is not really his cup of tea so if I'm showing him that and he's doing that and he can't follow along he will just quit he will not want to do it you understand what I'm saying like he will not want to code whereas when I put him on something like code academy free code camp or you know any of these online for Education tools that he he's bashing on he will just continuously write the thing that they're telling him he'll make progress he'll feel like he's moving forward the gamification actually makes it fun a funny example my exgirlfriend was a pro boxer a pro synchronized swimmer and just like a uh an athlete an Olympic level athlete her whole life now when I was teaching her coding when I was trying to teach her normally she was like she hated that right but then I found this game called code combat and code combat is basically and how I got her into it was I showed her code combat and code combat is a gam it's a game a video game based on with coding and so you know if there's an enemy you would say if enemy then attack and so she would write that and then she would attack the enemy and she would pick her syntax was whether it was JavaScript or python so the difference would be in Python she would use Whit spacing and indentation whereas in JavaScript she would do the semicolon and the closed pen and open pen and squigglies and and she started actually picking up programming that way because she was just solving puzzles and it was fun and she was starting to understand the logical part of how programming works and then later we could slowly start once her level of interest and excitement hers or my brothers is increased right take the average population not everybody's a hardcore wannabe programmer and just love everything about it once that starts to get increased then you start to incrementally introduce more and more complexity so like this guy is testing them for [ __ ] wrong things like if you're coming off of purely the simulation world like free code camp or whatever of course you're not going to know how to make a file on your computer cuz they've not done that so what is he getting out of testing that of course you're not going to know how to do that then you need an additional resource that then teaches you hey here's how you make a file on your computer here's how you do XYZ um and I also I want to hear him out but I also don't know what his like argument will be but you know just by feeling his vibe off of this video I feel like his argument would be like just shut everything out and uh you know uh live under a rock and just forget about these online simulations memorize code because that's what actually takes you to the next [ __ ] level I don't know I'm going to hear him out but I feel like if he had where I would be less pissed off because the reason why I'm pissed off is cuz like I want more people to learn and I want learning to become easier it's because of professors like these that try to make it hard just for the sake of it being hard and make the experience more on memorization which is a word that was used in the video it took out the fun of coding for people like me I didn't want to code for those reasons I wanted to do it because it was fun I was solving new problems and that was exciting it wasn't because here's how you make an exact HTML file and if you don't put HTML and you put hmtl the file breaks that stuff I learned later and I cared about all the technical stuff later using the command line to then make a file and touch a file and Etc and whatnot learning how to use Vim all those things I honestly cared about later once I discovered that programming was something even fun that I would I would even want to do so I did learn from corsera and Udacity and a lot of their platforms were just online education platforms and I did problem solve right within there but I still improved my problem solving skills and I'm badass today at programming but let's keep going I want to hear the gentleman out fully Adventures it doesn't teach you MIM and kids that had gone through Vim Adventures did not know how to edit a file using Vim in the terminal they had no idea because they never Associated the act of editing a file with the keystrokes that were happening from Bim adventures and the idea the idea the hypothesis behind a thing like Bim Adventures is oh these kids are going to master all these really great you know command line things the problem is that's not how your brain works your brain works by associating the task at hand with what you seeing that means you're looking at a terminal and you have a text file that needs to be edited what are the command okay so some points of agreement that I want to say there yes you're right if you are not using Vim on your command line you're not actually going to learn how to use it from playing that game I understand that that's a good point but here's what I will tell you the first time I was fascinated by vim and that made me want to learn Vim was because somebody sat me down I was at a coworking spot in Chicago it's called pumping St 1 PS1 I don't know if it still exists today or not great coworking spot and when I was there there was somebody that met me and was like yo you should learn them he was a senior developer he's like he going to Skyrock your ability Etc I thought I thought that was freaking cool I'm like I want to learn it so he brought me aside and he said I want you to learn Vim but check out this Vim Adventures play it for a day and then talk to me tomorrow and I just played Vim Adventures for a day and it was how to move my character with like a jkl um and or jkl sorry like how to move my character and basically just moving up and down left and right and Vim has its own set of um keys right how you move around and um I learned how to use move my character in that game and once I did I actually learned how to move around um and got comfortable with those keys then when I moved to an actual Visual Studio code it didn't translate over perfectly but one I was already introduced to the concept of how to move up down left and right without having to use arrows or something else uh the second thing I was already introduced to was like the fun aspect of it I was like this is actually fun I remember playing a game so I had positive emotions associated with Vim so before teaching and somebody learning something they have to be sold on learning that thing they have to actually want to do that thing so the first step to learning is building a desire you can't just start learning stuff that you don't have desire for and if you do it's a weak Foundation eventually you'll quit and you won't want to do that thing okay so that's an important thing to understand so when I'm learning vim and Vim Adventures while you're right it doesn't translate over one to one the first step you're actually doing with that is building the desire and the excitement for somebody and then you move them over into the command line the dark side of the you know the the programming world and then you you sneak them in it's kind of like if I was to introduce you to anime I won't be like bro let's sit down and watch parasite or some one of those crazy animes with like 15 freaking Seasons right code gas with like nine Seasons or whatnot the first thing I would do is be like let's watch uh Death Note you know let's watch like one of those mainstream anime so you can just kind of get into it Attack on Titans maybe and then you start watching like the crazier stuff so that's the way I think about it your fingers become associated with the movements and stuff to do that and that is exactly the same thing for web development if they had learned how to make a very simple web page and if I had walked them through using vs code or whatever to make an actual web page the same way an actual professional developer would do it then they would be building on actual skills using real tools and I cannot overstate how valuable that is because even if you learn the skill completely and you're doing it in the cloud on some educational website and you're not actually logging into a system where every single thing is the same then the pneumatic path the pneumatic yes that I agree with um I'm sorry I yeah sharing the screen okay good that I agree with yes if you don't do it in Visual Studio code at some point you know you have to switch over at some point and if you're not doing it at any point then yes those Pathways won't exist and you will be very confused when you actually go to the real grow so I 100% agree with that Pathways in your brain the neural Pathways and the neumatic uh pneumonic methods and stuff like that they're not going to work because your your brain is is used to associating all of this stuff the entire experience it's not just about knowing how to do X and Y command it's about having all the pieces be in sync so that when when you are put in a similar situation things there are a couple of areas where I've seen it more productive than others for example um code combat uh nice okay we agree on the code combat one that was something I was talking about earlier so thank you for bringing that up yes it is effective on the code combat and we are in agreement there that's cool that because they were doing coding and they had you know the actual syntax of the code that they were writing um you know they got they got better at writing that syntax but but they weren't solving real world problems they were solving you know a problem to help them beat beat the the monster so maybe correct that's true learn how to do recursion or something but it wasn't as effective in my opinion had they been you know solving their own problems I want to make a story game I want to make a something that accomplishes a particular goal of mine and and I agree with that too H if you associate it with your own problem you will learn more you will learn faster and you will retain the knowledge way more because it will be emotionally connected now with that said playing it as a game is the next closest thing to that because on one end you have a teacher handing you down a task and you have to do and that's one extreme of like you're forced to do something on the other end you have the Other Extreme which is you figuring out your own goal and your own desire so these are two extremes okay uh the teacher extreme is like you're feeling like you're forced to do stuff doesn't really feel good and then your extreme is the one that feels the best cuz you feel like you're coming up with it but it's really hard to come up with something in between that is something that makes it fun it feels like a game and you do it so when you're playing heads up with your friends imagine how motivated you are or when you're playing charades or when you're playing something like draw something and one person draws and the other person guesses what that thing is even though it's not a thing you came up with yourself you're very excited to play that game because of how that game works and it's giving you very interesting things to play off of so you're very motivated so I would say that it's better than learning in class because even the game gives you a task like hey defeat this enemy you're actually pretty motivated to defeat that enemy cuz you're like that is kind of aligned with my goal so it does build like an emotional connection though the strongest one would be if you fully came up with your own problem to solve and that just it's just much more visceral it's much more real it just tends to stick better so that's the end of the video really um I it's not to throw freeo Camp under the bus I understand that they've changed a lot but um the takeaway was I sent 45 people through free C Camp and only two of them could build a website afterwards a web page and those two had already learned how to do it before that that's the I don't know why you sound so defeated bro when you say that and the reason why I say that is because they're not supposed to have learned that like that is crazy that's like if I was like okay I want you to become a better fighter and I'm like but first you need to get your Jabs right so then I trained him I took him let's say I take you okay um and I'm like come on here you can leave your hoodie on cuz you already look so badass and I'm sure you're going to be good at fighting I put a punching bag in front of you and then I'm like okay throw your jab and throw your so you start throwing your Jabs and you start throwing your hooks like okay cool and I have you just train that for like two weeks 3 weeks four weeks and then the next day I just go all right son uh put on your gloves I'm going to put on my gloves let's Spar or I bring another fighter and I go okay you guys just Spar bro what do you think is going to happen you're going to get [ __ ] knocked on your ass you're going to gas out you're not even going to last a minute but are you going to be like I didn't get better at boxing no but you just didn't train for that environment so how do you expect to survive in the real environment but also you need to hit the bags too to actually improve your skill set to improve how you fight you can't not do bag work and so when you're looking at free code camp and other online resources they're very helpful cuz they strip away a lot out of the sparring right cuz in sparring I got to put my um the the I forget what what it's called but like the teeth thing we put right so you got to protect your teeth you got to put your head gear you got to put your gloves you got to wrap and you got to like you got to do all these things you got to warm up beforehand you can get too tired so there's a lot of this extra stuff so when you're coding on your own environment you got to set up your coding project you got to set up your folder structures you got to like set up whereas like if you're like dude I just want to solve a particular problem you free code Cam and these they just get you into the meat and potato of the problem so think of that as like hitting the bags or improving in chess for example right like I play chess I'm top 1% in chess and how I got good at it is by playing it of course and get and feedback over my games but I also got better because I do chess puzzles and so chess puzzles are like somebody else's game I solve that situation and then I just move on and sometimes it's not even somebody else's game and that pattern recognition comes into my own games and it helps me and then I can solve those tactics and like have a crushing combination that I can find because I I had done all these tactics beforehand that's how I think of like these online tools they're like helping you solve these tactics and they might not carry over 100% to the full game but these patterns do come into play so testing them on how to make a file and how to set up a folder structure when they did that zero times cuz they did free code Camp I think it's testing for the wrong thing but once the file structure is set up and once it start coding and once there is stuff and they have to add stuff or remove stuff or change stuff stuff that they have learned I bet you that that will still kick in and they'll still be able to do those things so those are just my thoughts I thought it was very entertaining I loved everything you said um even with the things I disagreed I respectfully disagree and uh the things that I agreed you know um I 100% agree so you know if you watched it would love to even have a chat with you you know comment on it but yeah guys thank you so much for watching I appreciate you like the video subscribe to the channel and with that said I love your beautiful face this is ky and I'll see you in the next video
