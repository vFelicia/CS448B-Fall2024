01:54 - still in the process right you can see
01:56 - the kind of tv in the back
01:58 - uh right there that tv is not
02:01 - uh hooked up yet so we have to set it up
02:04 - because i got a new apartment so i moved
02:06 - to a brand new place
02:08 - and setting it up i wanted to make this
02:10 - studio look a lot better than all the
02:12 - previous studios i've had so the
02:15 - lighting setup is pretty cool i got two
02:17 - lights
02:18 - in the back
02:20 - i put some trees so it feels like i'm in
02:23 - a i'm in a jungle it doesn't just feel
02:25 - like i'm in this barren land
02:28 - um and then you know the
02:30 - the white board in the back of course yo
02:32 - what's up guys we got 140 people here
02:35 - what's up rnj communications joseph joe
02:38 - hey aryan how are you doing hi marouf hi
02:41 - jay communications
02:43 - yeah um it's hard for me to show the
02:46 - exact setup because my camera is right
02:49 - there
02:50 - right so let me actually figure
02:52 - something out and see if i can
02:55 - see if i can connect to my phone
02:57 - and show you guys from my phone so we'll
03:00 - take a we'll take a look real quick
03:02 - let's see if i can connect my phone as a
03:05 - source
03:08 - okay does that work
03:10 - oh that actually works beautiful
03:13 - beautiful beautiful beautiful
03:15 - so i can actually show you guys a setup
03:17 - now let me see if i can go
03:20 - this way
03:23 - oh unfortunately that does not work like
03:26 - i expected it to work okay
03:28 - so
03:31 - let me do this
03:32 - let me stay here
03:34 - and let's see if i can add a
03:38 - give me one second i apologize guys
03:40 - we're we're doing this live
03:43 - so my apologies okay
03:45 - whoops
03:48 - let's see can i switch this camera
03:51 - to
03:52 - the phone
03:54 - perfect
03:56 - let's go
03:58 - oh that allowed us to go wide on it too
04:00 - perfect
04:03 - all right
04:05 - that is a terrible view i'll just show
04:07 - it like this let's take this off i
04:09 - apologize so this is the setup right now
04:11 - that i have
04:13 - i got one light over here
04:16 - i have another light over there i got
04:18 - the camera
04:19 - right
04:20 - uh my second monitor where all the chats
04:23 - and kind of everything is coming in that
04:24 - i'm seeing my stream deck is right here
04:26 - stream deck allows me to control the
04:28 - lights if i press this button the lights
04:30 - go off press this button the lights come
04:32 - on right all of these lights right there
04:35 - i got the speakers set up
04:38 - and then what's cool about this monitor
04:40 - right here is it can tilt so when i'm
04:43 - coding i like to code on a like vertical
04:47 - monitor setup instead of like a
04:51 - um
04:52 - instead of a sideways setup you know
04:54 - how do you guys like the code by the way
04:56 - have you guys tried any vertical
04:57 - monitors because they're really really
04:59 - really cool like if you ever try a
05:01 - vertical monitor it's really cool by the
05:03 - way it's sachin's birthday so happy
05:05 - birthday sachin happy birthday
05:09 - yeah so vertical monitor like i can code
05:12 - all along and i don't have to scroll as
05:14 - much i can see the context of the entire
05:17 - like
05:18 - app in one go so if my coding
05:20 - productivity improves a lot when i have
05:22 - a vertical monitor set up it's
05:25 - planted there as you can see
05:28 - um clean setup yeah it's not super clean
05:31 - yet i'm working on making it clean
05:34 - uh it's it's decent it's decent it's
05:35 - definitely a decent setup but we've got
05:38 - to do a lot of improvement on it
05:41 - so let's see if i can switch my camera
05:44 - back here perfect
05:46 - okay
05:47 - so
05:48 - that wasn't too bad it wasn't too bad
05:50 - we
05:52 - we made it we made it work yeah
05:56 - all right what's going on why don't you
05:58 - make videos on data science kafka hadoop
06:02 - yeah that would actually be a fun idea i
06:04 - am not very good at data science so if i
06:06 - were to make videos they would be kind
06:08 - of from scratch
06:10 - and so it'd be like newbie videos if you
06:12 - guys are cool with that
06:13 - hey i'm down that would be fun
06:18 - um do you guys by the way do you guys do
06:22 - clean setup yeah you're an inspiration

08:32 - it
08:33 - most definitely
08:35 - what's up yo front
08:38 - forum focus what is up
08:44 - um
08:45 - we definitely have a lot of react on the
08:47 - channel like every video has react
08:49 - i can't remember the last video that
08:51 - didn't have react except for this one
08:53 - right this one is not going to have that
08:54 - much react
08:57 - dope programmer says hey i got a chance
08:59 - to build social media because if you
09:00 - thank you thanks qazi i appreciate you
09:02 - as well thank you
09:04 - i'm happy that you're working on it
09:07 - i just completed your amazon clone it's
09:09 - so amazing 100 you got it
09:16 - yeah those react videos are a lot of fun
09:18 - honestly they're a lot of fun but every
09:19 - video that we do even if we're doing if
09:21 - even if we're doing these web 3 videos
09:24 - they are very heavily focused on react
09:27 - there's a lot of react in there so
09:30 - we're definitely not by any means
09:33 - cutting out react or doing less of it i
09:35 - think that we're doing even more of it
09:36 - because these projects are
09:38 - massive and then there's ton of react
09:40 - work that's happening in there
09:45 - oh some coding news that actually would
09:47 - be fun that's actually a great idea
09:50 - coding news like kind of what's new
09:52 - do you guys know any good websites for
09:54 - that um
09:56 - because
09:57 - there was something
10:00 - there's this blog app that's like pretty
10:02 - good or
10:03 - i forget what it's called but it like
10:05 - you go there and it shows you
10:07 - like a couple of trending blogs or
10:09 - what's going on in the developer world
10:17 - by the way i noticed your courses are
10:18 - very practical oriented have you
10:20 - considered covering some more of the
10:21 - academic stuff like data structures and
10:24 - algorithms
10:25 - yes so
10:27 - uh that is actually a really good idea
10:29 - we definitely have
10:31 - uh we're definitely that's something
10:33 - we're actually thinking about data
10:34 - structures and algorithms lance who's
10:36 - new on our team well he's not new
10:38 - anymore he's been
10:40 - working with us for over six months now
10:42 - but
10:43 - lance he's one of our bootcamp
10:45 - instructors and he is really good at
10:47 - data structures and algorithms so
10:50 - we've been thinking about him teaching
10:52 - some data structures and algorithm stuff
10:54 - on this
10:56 - channel that would be really really cool
11:00 - next js with typescript yep we're
11:02 - definitely doing we've done some
11:04 - typescript but yeah we're definitely
11:06 - doing a lot of next.js
11:12 - thank you for your react videos i
11:14 - recently got an internship as a react
11:16 - developer brilliant that makes me so
11:18 - happy to hear that is awesome
11:20 - really proud of you for that yo david
11:23 - what is up broski david is like cause
11:26 - he's flexing that uh
11:28 - because he's flexing the studio yeah
11:31 - yeah a little bit i'm flexing it and i'm
11:33 - also sharing with everybody the studio
11:35 - and uh
11:36 - you know just kind of showed them what i
11:38 - have in here
11:41 - would you guys want to know how much the
11:42 - studio costs
11:45 - or does anybody want to take a guess how
11:47 - much the studio costs
11:48 - let's see
11:50 - can i do a poll
11:54 - uh i can only add yes or no
11:58 - options
12:00 - it's kind of boring
12:02 - yeah take a guess
12:04 - i don't actually know at the top of my
12:05 - head how much it costs so i'll have to
12:07 - think about it
12:09 - but yeah take a guess and uh i'll let
12:12 - you guys know if you guys are in the
12:13 - right direction or not
12:16 - the person that gets guesses the closest
12:20 - how about this i'll paypal you
12:22 - i'll pay pal you uh fifty dollars okay
12:26 - how about that we'll keep it simple
12:35 - oh webassembly stuff
12:36 - zacky man i'm staying away from that
12:39 - webassembly bro aryan says 8 thousand
12:42 - dollars
12:45 - jj trent says 200 000
12:50 - 60
12:51 - ten thousand dollars hmm interesting
12:53 - fifty thousand
12:55 - man you guys are uh
12:58 - you guys are guessing some
13:00 - massive numbers you could be right or
13:03 - you could be wrong
13:07 - i don't know
13:08 - david do you want to like
13:10 - calculate how much my studio is like
13:14 - roughly even if it's not exact and just
13:16 - text it to me don't post it in youtube
13:18 - chat but text it to me
13:21 - and i'll take a look at it
13:25 - 20k okay between one and two million
13:28 - dollars yeah that would be a really nice
13:30 - studio huh
13:38 - one trillion dollars
13:42 - no audio you guys should be able to hear
13:44 - my audio right
13:48 - i hope so
13:50 - i hope so
13:51 - my keyboard is a very simple keyboard
13:54 - this my keyboard is just the apple
13:56 - keyboard regular one
14:02 - it's very dirty but it's the apple
14:04 - keyboard as you can see
14:09 - right regular keyboard
14:12 - i used to have a mechanical keyboard but
14:14 - then i decided to not use a mechanical
14:17 - keyboard anymore because
14:20 - it has a windows key most of the times
14:22 - and it's kind of annoying because
14:24 - apple you don't have that key and then
14:26 - there's
14:27 - alt and
14:28 - apple doesn't have alt apple has like
14:30 - option and control and so then
14:32 - it doesn't really work and then
14:34 - my f3 and my f4 buttons
14:38 - and my brightness buttons like they
14:40 - don't really work as normally as you
14:42 - would expect
14:45 - 7200
14:47 - boom
14:49 - let's see
14:53 - um
15:03 - all right david is uh david is giving me
15:07 - kind of some guesses hey i've already
15:09 - shown my board buddy maybe you wanna
15:13 - thank you amanath i appreciate that good
15:16 - work
15:17 - good work good work
15:19 - uh if anybody wants to jump on the
15:22 - stream to do an interview or something
15:23 - do let me know that could be cool
15:25 - because we could definitely set that up
15:29 - tried any functional programming stuff
15:34 - yeah functional programming is a lot of
15:35 - fun but i haven't been trying anything
15:37 - functional programming
15:38 - recently except i'm just doing a lot of
15:40 - functional programming
15:42 - in javascript but yeah i was doing
15:44 - closure and things of that nature
15:47 - audio is good right can somebody
15:48 - communicate yeah yeah people are saying
15:49 - good audio
15:51 - but some people are saying no audio
15:53 - but then some people saying audio is
15:54 - gucci
15:57 - hmm
15:58 - that is confusing man
16:01 - matec
16:02 - matex says it is where's my tech montage
16:07 - my bad my touch says it's nine
16:10 - k my studio setup nine thousand dollars
16:14 - and then i'll put on some guesses
16:21 - all right i'll i'll put up some guesses
16:23 - at this point
16:25 - and you guys pick
16:27 - honestly guys i apologize i don't even
16:30 - know who's the closest one oh wait i
16:32 - know
16:33 - [Music]
16:34 - there's a few people who are pretty
16:35 - close actually
16:39 - um
16:42 - there's one person
16:44 - that got it exact
16:46 - like on the dot
16:52 - a few people that got on the dot so i
16:53 - apologize i'll have to pick one person
16:56 - kind of randomly
16:57 - even if multiple people got it
17:00 - but if you took multiple guesses
17:03 - and they were different
17:05 - i don't think i'll count you
17:07 - you have to pick one and stick with it
17:10 - there's some people who are guessing
17:11 - everything and
17:13 - no that's not happening
17:16 - that is not happening you have to pick
17:17 - one guess and stick with it
17:22 - uh david can you write down the names of
17:26 - everybody who's like either got it or is
17:28 - extremely close and just like write down
17:30 - those names not in the chat not in the
17:32 - chat not in youtube chat but like just
17:35 - text me on my phone that'd be great
17:41 - yo
17:42 - another thing i got i got a freaking
17:44 - green screen you guys want to see the
17:46 - green screen i've never used a green
17:48 - screen before
17:50 - ever
17:51 - ever because i always thought it was so
17:53 - much work to set up the damn thing and
17:55 - it would take forever oh by the way i'm
17:57 - also training for a marathon so that's
17:59 - crazy
18:00 - if any of you are runners you should add
18:02 - me on strava
18:06 - you should add me on strava app i'd love
18:09 - to see your runs and push you and
18:12 - selfishly you'll push me and then i'll
18:15 - keep running and then i'll do my
18:16 - marathon my marathon is happening
18:18 - october
18:21 - 9th i believe october 9th so it's in
18:24 - 15 weeks less than four months so pretty
18:27 - scary
18:28 - pretty scary
18:30 - all right so my boy is collecting names
18:33 - now david
18:34 - and he'll find whoever is the closest
18:36 - and then one person wins and i'll send
18:39 - send you money through their paypal or
18:40 - crypto whatever is easiest for you well
18:43 - like we'll pick one person and you get
18:45 - 50 bucks okay
18:49 - all right guys we're now going to stop
18:52 - taking more answers
18:54 - for the studio after this point okay so
18:58 - amanath anything that's after the
18:59 - timestamp of 9 17 a.m
19:04 - pacific time
19:05 - don't take that anymore
19:07 - but the correct
19:09 - answer
19:14 - let me put up a poll
19:16 - let's put up a poll
19:18 - i'll add a few options okay a lot of few
19:20 - options
19:24 - boom
19:24 - let's go here and we'll say
19:29 - twenty thousand we'll say
19:31 - a hundred thousand we'll say five
19:34 - thousand
19:48 - all right
19:51 - so i'm gonna put this poll
19:54 - and uh
19:56 - you guys can take a guess
19:58 - on this poll as well
20:01 - all right
20:02 - let's see those answers coming in
20:04 - hot let's see what people are guessing
20:09 - some people are guessing 20k nice
20:14 - soon we'll do the reveal of how much
20:16 - this entire studio setup costs
20:32 - all right we'll announce the winner
20:35 - soon or probably later in the stream so
20:37 - stick around okay gives you another
20:39 - reason to stick around
20:41 - but uh
20:43 - there are some there are
20:45 - there are some people who guessed it
20:48 - very very accurate and uh
20:52 - we'll be picking you we'll be picking
20:53 - yeah
20:54 - yeah so that's what's going on um
20:57 - let me let me go
21:00 - here oh oh yeah did you guys say you
21:03 - wanted to see the green screen
21:05 - yeah
21:06 - no i can't remember well i don't care
21:08 - i'm gonna pop up the green screen
21:10 - because i never had it before so let me
21:12 - give me one second here
21:28 - there we go
21:30 - and
21:32 - i know it's not really doing anything
21:34 - right now
21:36 - but
21:37 - it does something
21:39 - once i start moving it closer to me
21:42 - okay so
21:44 - once i move the camera closer to me
21:46 - that's when it does something so take a
21:47 - look at this
21:49 - now
21:50 - i can be just chilling here
21:53 - right
21:54 - and
21:56 - i'm in the freaking screen yo like what
22:01 - that is so cool
22:03 - i don't know about you guys
22:04 - but i definitely
22:06 - find this setup
22:08 - really really cool being able to like
22:10 - kind of merge in and then if we're
22:12 - coding
22:14 - right like if there's some kind of
22:16 - coding going on
22:18 - it looks so much better coding like this
22:21 - so like in my new tutorials
22:23 - you know i definitely want to have
22:26 - um
22:27 - i definitely want to have some action
22:30 - like this right
22:32 - like isn't this a lot better
22:34 - instead of
22:35 - instead of like my screen before my
22:38 - screen was like so stupid it was i would
22:39 - do this
22:41 - do this right and it takes up like look
22:44 - at that that stupid square is blocking
22:46 - so much of the code
22:49 - and boom now there's like very little
22:51 - code that's being blocked or i could
22:52 - even like put myself on the other side
22:55 - and flip flip the camera or whatever
22:57 - right and then that gives
23:02 - that gives like even more space and just
23:04 - chill here
23:05 - right and then boom we're going through
23:06 - the code
23:08 - and it's like all right guys we're
23:10 - importing a bunch of stuff
23:13 - and then we're creating
23:14 - sidebar we have our sidebar option
23:16 - component
23:18 - and then it does stuff and let's check
23:19 - out our modal component
23:21 - [Music]
23:24 - big brains
23:28 - so
23:29 - yeah
23:31 - this just looks so much better
23:33 - so much better
23:36 - she's
23:37 - says your studio is lit thank you i
23:39 - appreciate it
23:40 - i appreciate it
23:43 - and as soon as i start dropping a green
23:45 - screen down
23:46 - it's gonna start showing the background
23:48 - behind me
23:49 - hey look at my hand
23:52 - oh and and one of the most awesome parts
23:55 - now i can point somebody said this in my
23:57 - team meeting yesterday i'm going to
23:58 - point to stuff so check it out
24:00 - this is my favorite part
24:03 - so like if i'm like trying to teach you
24:04 - something right for example
24:06 - you know what is this slicing business
24:08 - that's happening
24:09 - right over there
24:11 - let me let me uh
24:13 - let me mirror myself so i can like point
24:15 - accurately
24:16 - right so it's like hey what is that
24:18 - slicing stuff that's actually happening
24:20 - over there the slice of 39
24:22 - or
24:23 - what are we doing here slicing from zero
24:25 - to six well what we're doing here is
24:27 - we're getting the first six strings of
24:30 - current
24:30 - account right and then we're getting the
24:34 - pretty much the last
24:36 - like from 39 on
24:39 - and i can i can literally move around
24:42 - like this and point to
24:44 - stuff and i don't know in my mind i feel
24:47 - like that'll make understanding what's
24:50 - going on actually a lot easier
24:52 - for you right so then that way i can
24:55 - like literally show you like
24:57 - this is the div that's doing the thing
25:00 - right this is the current user
25:03 - dot name that we need access to so i
25:05 - kind of love that and i can do that in
25:07 - my live streams i could do that
25:09 - you know when i'm recording a video
25:12 - um
25:14 - part says why are you not streaming a
25:16 - game i mean i think i would love to
25:18 - stream chess
25:19 - if you guys would want to watch because
25:21 - like i play chess competitively and i
25:23 - enjoy it a lot
25:25 - um so that's definitely something cool
25:30 - yeah programmer marine says that's a lot
25:32 - better
25:34 - yeah we have a lot of people saying
25:35 - aaron says yo that's a lot better
25:38 - uh mattel says yes it looks amazing
25:41 - thank you guys i appreciate that that
25:43 - looks so much better
25:46 - appreciate it appreciate it thank you
25:50 - aaron says big thank you story web 3 and
25:52 - react starting from your videos i
25:55 - appreciate you thank you so much
25:58 - yeah so this
26:01 - this setup is definitely pretty cool
26:03 - [Music]
26:05 - i mean i could even this is kind of cool
26:07 - like i could do my videos like this to
26:10 - show off that i'm a i'm a coder
26:12 - right like
26:14 - everything i do just has like this is
26:16 - probably how people just imagine me they
26:18 - just imagine that i just have like code
26:20 - in the background all the time just
26:22 - like oh must code
26:27 - just
26:28 - 24 7.
26:31 - i mean
26:32 - i kind of do so
26:35 - i kind of do code a lot
26:37 - all right so uh this is what's happening
26:39 - here and then going back to
26:42 - where we were
26:43 - yeah so add me on strava you guys
26:46 - add me on strava if anybody's using this
26:49 - app
26:50 - add me here i don't know what my
26:51 - username is
26:55 - but i think if you type in rafikaze
26:58 - you'll probably find me i'm not
27:01 - not exactly sure
27:03 - all right and yeah i'm a beginner runner
27:06 - pretty beginner very very newbie have
27:09 - terrible
27:10 - times at least for myself like
27:12 - 11 minute is fast for me i'm like dying
27:15 - at a oh you can't see anything
27:18 - oops sorry let me get out of your way
27:21 - so yeah like at 11 minutes i'm like kind
27:23 - of dying
27:25 - uh not very good so if i could use your
27:27 - help with that
27:29 - that'd be great
27:30 - my screen is moving at 20 frame rates
27:32 - per second is that true is my screen
27:34 - moving that slow
27:38 - i hope not i hope not
27:42 - the green screen is reducing the
27:44 - blocking of the code that's pretty good
27:46 - yeah because that used to be one of the
27:48 - very common complaints right every time
27:50 - somebody would be like
27:52 - you're blocking the code
27:55 - just so much anger and hate
27:58 - but
27:59 - we can avoid all that anger and hate by
28:02 - by just simply
28:04 - using a green screen in the back
28:07 - i'm surprised how good a green screen
28:09 - actually is like it's it's kind of
28:11 - mind-blowing that it works
28:13 - as well as it does
28:15 - a strava is just a running app
28:18 - right here this right there just a
28:20 - running app
28:21 - and like you could use it to run
28:25 - and uh
28:26 - track
28:27 - stuff and like you could you could add
28:29 - friends on here and send friend requests
28:32 - and stuff like that so i don't know if
28:33 - anybody runs here at all but if you do
28:36 - feel free to add me on here
28:38 - let's go look at some coding news with
28:40 - this new setup
28:44 - hmm that's a good point real programming
28:47 - is an elitist myth
28:51 - i kind of like this because even without
28:54 - re
28:54 - oh my god is this one of those websites
28:57 - that begs you to pay them
29:00 - if you're even looking at it for one
29:01 - second
29:03 - seems like it
29:05 - but
29:06 - stop bothering us now so that's good
29:09 - we'll zoom in
29:10 - here look at this i'm in the freaking
29:14 - screen
29:15 - this is sick
29:17 - just my arm looks a little bit cut off
29:19 - but who cares who cares right this is
29:21 - fine
29:22 - it's not that bad
29:26 - um
29:28 - okay i
29:30 - have to do
29:35 - let's move it up a little bit so it
29:37 - doesn't cut my head off all the time
29:41 - there we go now i have headspace
29:43 - perfect
29:45 - yeah so i let me know what you guys
29:47 - think about this right real real
29:49 - programming is an elitist myth and
29:52 - i don't know about you guys but i kind
29:54 - of agree with this because um
29:58 - a lot of people will tell you
30:00 - hey pro there's real programming this is
30:03 - what a real programmer does a real
30:05 - programmer uses vim
30:11 - or a real programmer
30:13 - a real programmer uses the command line
30:17 - they don't use a gui to push their code
30:20 - they don't use a gui
30:22 - to use git
30:24 - and version control
30:26 - they use the command line
30:29 - oh you used an extension from vs code
30:34 - you are a noob you need to be using the
30:36 - command line more
30:37 - like that type of stuff right is just
30:40 - total
30:42 - [ __ ] because that's not true like
30:44 - you can code
30:46 - however you want and there are plenty of
30:49 - incredible programmers who are still
30:51 - using sublime text
30:53 - so blind text
30:54 - those days are gone you should just use
30:57 - either vs code or if you're going to use
30:59 - an online tool then use an online tool
31:01 - like replit or whatever but like don't
31:04 - use
31:07 - don't use sublime text guys i mean
31:09 - that's been that's it's over
31:11 - if you use sublime text you're not a
31:13 - real programmer you're a fake programmer
31:16 - but
31:17 - yeah like most things you guys are
31:19 - totally fine right like most
31:22 - whatever way that you code is your way
31:24 - of coding and it's okay like it's
31:26 - totally fine you don't have to freak out
31:28 - about it
31:29 - um
31:31 - going to come after you if you're using
31:33 - i mean you know some there's like some
31:35 - developers i know that we're using like
31:37 - notepad and text edit and like weird
31:40 - stuff to code and they're phenomenal
31:42 - developers so it's whatever your flow is
31:46 - you're gonna be fine
31:48 - and everybody codes in different ways
31:50 - for example i was never really good at
31:51 - data structures and algorithms yet i
31:53 - could build a ton of stuff so it does it
31:55 - didn't matter that i never got good at
31:57 - it or
31:58 - wasn't super interested in all the
32:01 - nerdy intricacies
32:03 - it's
32:04 - it's um
32:05 - coding is a there's a lot of creativity
32:08 - involved and i think people often forget
32:10 - that
32:11 - i use the regular default notepad
32:14 - because i'm godly aaron says
32:17 - i mean yo props to you man if you can
32:20 - pull that off
32:21 - that's huge you don't even need anything
32:26 - david says you can use a you can code
32:29 - however you want unless you use a gui
32:30 - that's for fake programmers only
32:34 - there you go you should
32:36 - i love this
32:39 - david says you should code on paper
32:42 - agreed
32:43 - if you want to be a real programmer
32:50 - i i definitely hate all that scrum solid
32:54 - agile uncle bob crap yeah i'm not a huge
32:56 - fan of uncle bob like that stuff was
32:58 - weird like when i was even watching that
33:00 - video just so long and this guy just
33:03 - thinks like he knows everything and it's
33:05 - just
33:07 - oh
33:07 - so frustrating like i can't even imagine
33:10 - being his wife like jesus christ man
33:13 - [ __ ]
33:14 - that is uh uncle bob is a
33:17 - interesting cat
33:19 - but yeah i watched a video a bunch and
33:21 - i'm just like this is
33:23 - this is crazy i'm not sure what's
33:24 - happening here
33:27 - yeah colorized theme yeah you're you're
33:31 - you're not a real developer
33:34 - alejandro says stop blocking the code
33:37 - hey i got this freaking green screen
33:39 - just so i
33:41 - oh
33:42 - i wasn't
33:43 - so i was blocking the code because there
33:46 - wasn't anything happening with the code
33:47 - earlier
33:51 - uh my chest elo is like
33:53 - 2000 to 2200
33:56 - depending on the day time
33:59 - whether
34:02 - um
34:03 - my head being in the right place and me
34:05 - not being an idiot
34:07 - things like that
34:10 - yep so
34:12 - there is some programming news for you
34:15 - hopefully that was pretty good
34:22 - let's see what other things will catch
34:23 - our eyes
34:25 - the new startup no code no problem
34:28 - interesting so yeah there's this whole
34:30 - no code movement going on
34:32 - i am a big
34:35 - proponent of it i support it
34:38 - um
34:40 - jeez man
34:42 - pegging me for freaking
34:44 - [Music]
34:47 - emails
34:50 - no do not email me
34:54 - all right
34:55 - continue reading there we go
34:59 - that was
35:00 - easy you now you don't need to know any
35:04 - programming to launch a company we've
35:05 - been approaching this moment for years
35:08 - so basically what they're saying is
35:10 - there are tools like
35:12 - webflow
35:17 - zapier that allow you to like
35:20 - automate a bunch of stuff which yeah
35:22 - there is there's parts of it that are
35:23 - pretty true because you can you can glue
35:26 - together a lot of clever logic using
35:28 - zapier which makes sense right like so
35:31 - if you have an automation somebody opts
35:33 - into your email and then it sends them
35:35 - this thing and it sends them the next
35:36 - thing and then
35:38 - you can do a lot of that with zapier
35:41 - her company
35:42 - scribbly.io let's take a look at this
35:46 - let's look at this
35:53 - unbeatable content marketing services to
35:56 - grow your business book a strategy call
35:58 - tell us your goals and put your content
36:00 - on autopilot
36:05 - wow
36:07 - definitely looks really cool actually
36:10 - i would be interested in actually
36:12 - hitting them up so this looks super cool
36:14 - scribbly dot io
36:20 - i mean yeah so it looks like it's a
36:22 - basic website uh air table and online
36:24 - spreadsheet letter sort details about
36:26 - each job yep airtable is very very
36:28 - powerful tool if you use air table and
36:31 - use zapier and you use webflow you could
36:33 - do a lot of automation there
36:36 - yes that is
36:37 - that that is true
36:39 - uh she has 23 clients and was doing 25
36:42 - 000 in recurring business so basically
36:46 - at the time that this article was
36:47 - written
36:48 - the owner of this website was doing
36:50 - about 23 to 25 000 a month which is
36:52 - pretty good
36:56 - especially if you're a new business
36:57 - owner it's like really really good
37:00 - and i imagine you know you have a couple
37:02 - of people who are paying you this much
37:04 - and you're writing content for them and
37:06 - then they're just recurring customers
37:08 - so
37:10 - that's pretty good
37:12 - but
37:14 - here's the thing
37:17 - majority of this no code stuff will get
37:20 - you really far really really far but
37:23 - what i realized is even with the no code
37:25 - stuff
37:26 - you will still need to know some
37:28 - programming concepts actually pull it
37:30 - off like even with webflow and even with
37:33 - like cms's if you know some programming
37:36 - stuff
37:37 - it really benefits you and you build
37:40 - things a lot faster
37:42 - and
37:43 - why i like a lot of no code stuff is if
37:45 - you have an idea or you want to mvp you
37:48 - can do really really quick
37:50 - and just test it out and if you like it
37:52 - then you can spend the next few weeks
37:55 - coding it up because often times when
37:58 - you're coding something up
38:00 - the performance of that thing is going
38:02 - to be really really sharp and you're
38:03 - going to have a lot of fine-tuned
38:06 - control over it if you don't care about
38:08 - that much fine-tuned control over every
38:10 - single little aspect
38:12 - then yeah i recommend if you're building
38:14 - a sas or you're building something just
38:16 - use tools put it together
38:18 - but
38:19 - if you're
38:20 - at a job and you're at a company working
38:24 - and they have built something with react
38:26 - then you'll need to know react or if
38:28 - they have built something in web3 then
38:30 - you'll need to know wep3 in order to
38:32 - continue building on top of their
38:34 - software and to continue growing their
38:37 - software and to continue
38:39 - making that software more robust over
38:41 - time
38:50 - by the way on the topic of controversial
38:52 - opinions how do you feel about open
38:53 - source software in the fsf especially
38:56 - some of those extreme richard stallman
38:58 - stuff i haven't followed any of the
39:03 - fsf stuff i don't even know what that is
39:05 - or who richard
39:07 - stallman is
39:09 - but i know that
39:12 - linus torvals is a huge proponent of
39:14 - open software
39:16 - i am not against it i think it's really
39:19 - cool
39:20 - i was thinking about what open source
39:22 - software's i know that are
39:24 - really prominent and one of them that
39:26 - comes to my mind that i use pretty much
39:28 - every day is actually leeches
39:30 - leaches.org
39:35 - this thing
39:37 - and this is open source and this has
39:38 - like so much traffic i like this more
39:41 - than chess.com
39:43 - and
39:44 - most of the great players that i know
39:46 - actually play on here and the experience
39:48 - is
39:49 - awesome like
39:51 - playing here the experience is just so
39:52 - good
39:54 - i'll try not to play the entire game
39:57 - here
39:58 - but
39:59 - like the the entire experience of
40:01 - leaches is just in my opinion
40:04 - a lot better okay let's close out of it
40:06 - so it doesn't turn into a chess game
40:09 - and that's open source
40:11 - and uh if i go to if i go back to
40:14 - leaches
40:16 - you can see that it's open source where
40:18 - does it say again
40:20 - usually says on the home page that it's
40:22 - free let me go as incognito yep
40:26 - so lead chess is a free
40:28 - libre no ads open source chess server
40:33 - right and if i go to
40:38 - are github
40:39 - they often allow you to
40:41 - link you to their github
40:44 - twitch
40:45 - source code there we go
40:48 - source code and
40:53 - main backend and front end scala okay
40:56 - let's click that
41:01 - right boom there we go
41:03 - so
41:04 - all of the code is here
41:07 - for elite chess
41:09 - that is
41:11 - that is really phenomenal
41:14 - and you have
41:16 - 303 contributors
41:18 - helping make this a reality
41:21 - that is really really cool that you know
41:24 - that's something that would be really
41:25 - hard to pull off outside of something
41:27 - like this but you just have all these
41:29 - people coming in building it together
41:31 - and then they're really listening to the
41:32 - community and they're just making this
41:34 - phenomenal product
41:36 - and anybody that needs to add anything
41:37 - can just go ahead and code it up and
41:39 - actually help out
41:41 - an end result is such a brilliant and
41:44 - phenomenal product that leeches is and
41:46 - even their app is really really amazing
41:48 - so
41:50 - yeah i mean hats off to them for being
41:52 - able to pull this off and the whole
41:54 - interface just clean
41:56 - no ads nothing
41:58 - so i i like the open source movement i
42:00 - think it's great
42:03 - i also see the point of
42:05 - not open source right because that's
42:07 - also something i was thinking about on
42:08 - my run yesterday which is
42:11 - who's gonna pay for these people to be
42:14 - thinking about the thing 24 7 because
42:17 - they at some point need to do other
42:19 - things in their life right so open
42:20 - source yeah you'll code it up but then
42:21 - you need to actually put food on the
42:23 - table
42:24 - so then you're going to go do your job
42:26 - but with a job if you're working at
42:28 - microsoft or whatever you're making a
42:30 - hundred two hundred thousand dollars you
42:31 - can just fully focus and not worry about
42:34 - anything else and like literally do that
42:37 - for
42:37 - 10 12 hours a day
42:41 - that is a lot more fun
42:44 - and then you can build something really
42:46 - really great because you're obsessed
42:48 - about that thing and you're doing that
42:50 - thing every single day
42:52 - so within six months a year two years
42:54 - three years four years five years you're
42:55 - gonna build a better product that's why
42:57 - i think vs code
42:59 - is one of the best products out there
43:01 - and it's a private you know it's it's by
43:04 - microsoft it's not an open source
43:07 - software
43:09 - and
43:10 - um you know the best operating systems
43:14 - are not like
43:15 - i wouldn't use linux
43:17 - i tried linux it sucks i will never use
43:19 - it it's awful you can barely play a
43:21 - freaking normal video on there you don't
43:24 - have any editing tools you can barely
43:26 - even use the computer your email clients
43:28 - suck everything sucks
43:31 - like everything sucks zoom doesn't work
43:33 - properly
43:34 - it's it's trash
43:37 - um
43:39 - i honestly don't know why people use it
43:41 - they're like oh you could do sudo
43:42 - apt-get who cares there's homebrew
43:46 - and there's all this other stuff that
43:48 - makes things easier so why are you
43:50 - sitting here and using
43:52 - linux like i don't know like i i just
43:55 - feel like it's people just being extra
43:56 - nerdy and just like oh i have a linux
43:59 - setup ah that's so cool like good for
44:02 - you
44:03 - but
44:04 - you know
44:06 - i don't know it's just
44:08 - um i i think either pick windows or pick
44:11 - mac
44:12 - and they're like mature operating
44:14 - systems they have actual support you can
44:17 - call support they'll help you
44:20 - and they have you know they're just very
44:22 - mature and then the whole native
44:24 - ecosystem syncs in and my imessages show
44:28 - up on my
44:29 - computer and they're synced with my
44:30 - phone and like my notifications work the
44:33 - right way and when i turn on focus mode
44:35 - it puts me on focus mode on my phone
44:37 - like the whole thing works right
44:39 - you know i personally think mac is the
44:42 - best of both worlds because you have
44:44 - this
44:45 - delicious gooey yummy
44:48 - native world
44:49 - along and then high performance along
44:52 - with like
44:53 - all the command line benefits you know
44:56 - so as a developer
44:58 - i that's one of the reasons i never go
45:00 - to windows because like
45:03 - first of all text rendering resolution i
45:04 - needed to be 5k i'm so used to it now
45:07 - that i need my text to render in 5k and
45:10 - i can tell when the text isn't rendering
45:12 - in 5k like and it doesn't look
45:15 - as good and so i've i avoid
45:18 - um anything
45:20 - like that and so yeah until windows has
45:23 - 5k monitors that's definitely one thing
45:27 - uh the other thing is
45:29 - just getting the whole command line and
45:30 - everything set up is always a pain with
45:32 - windows and there's always
45:35 - more annoying steps to do than if you're
45:37 - doing it just in plain mac or linux
45:40 - there's always like extra stuff that you
45:43 - have to do or there'll always be a
45:44 - tutorial they'll be like here's how to
45:46 - do this thing in five easy steps
45:50 - um
45:52 - but if you have a windows here's this
45:54 - other like sadistic complicated guide
45:57 - [ __ ] off like click this and just like
46:00 - figure it out yourself
46:02 - i'm not even gonna write the guide for
46:04 - you just like click this and and go
46:06 - somewhere else and figure it out
46:08 - so
46:09 - i feel like
46:12 - yeah
46:13 - window stuff is uh
46:16 - i don't know just makes me kind of
46:18 - like vomit a little in my mouth but you
46:21 - know
46:22 - you can still code on there like you'll
46:24 - be fine
46:28 - uh
46:32 - yeah muhammad says um i use windows but
46:35 - i have to admit that the windows command
46:37 - line sucks and it's worse than bash yeah
46:40 - that's that's all i'm saying like for
46:42 - coding and stuff it's always a problem
46:43 - to install stuff it's kind of a problem
46:46 - and i wish that they had a better
46:48 - command line system
46:51 - uh going on there
46:54 - um
46:55 - uh yeah zacky says hey i disagree with
46:57 - you derek qazi linux has its own place i
47:00 - use arch myself and i'll admit that
47:01 - windows and mac os is more friendly for
47:03 - the average user but calling linux trash
47:05 - flat out is
47:07 - so
47:08 - here's what i'll say if you're not
47:10 - if your main purpose is like just
47:12 - developing i think it's
47:16 - good
47:18 - you know i don't even know that vs code
47:20 - dude i don't know what they have
47:22 - like i'm not sure i don't even want to
47:24 - find out and like things are not even
47:26 - built for them properly but yeah like i
47:28 - think for coding
47:30 - it's probably good
47:31 - but then you have to have a zoom meeting
47:34 - and then like you have to
47:35 - share your screen and like zoom doesn't
47:37 - work properly and then sharing your
47:39 - screen
47:40 - like still shows all the people and it's
47:43 - kind of like annoying and it's like
47:47 - as a developer unfortunately you'll have
47:49 - more meetings then you'll get the right
47:52 - code
47:53 - and so i feel like all of those things
47:55 - work properly i wouldn't [ __ ] on linux
47:58 - this hard
47:59 - if
48:01 - they just build proper support for
48:03 - everything like for at least for like
48:05 - normal things like slack
48:07 - zoom
48:09 - like normal simple things that the whole
48:12 - world uses unless they build that
48:15 - i am just like it's trash and i want to
48:17 - run away and i also respect your opinion
48:20 - that you don't think it's trash you use
48:21 - it that's totally fine
48:30 - um i'll i can i could have gone full
48:32 - screen a while ago
48:36 - [Music]
48:43 - my bad that that rant who cares about
48:46 - pseudo
48:47 - that rant went on longer than i had
48:50 - expected my
48:51 - apologies
48:54 - where did my
48:56 - youtube studio go ah there it is
49:01 - that rant went on forever huh
49:09 - let's see did everybody go crazy in the
49:10 - comments was there a war
49:15 - yes some someone asked do you know the
49:17 - bota sisters yes i do know them not
49:20 - personally although i did run into the
49:23 - bodhis sisters
49:25 - um at the las vegas nationals uh no not
49:29 - nationals las vegas chess tournament
49:33 - and i saw
49:35 - botest there
49:36 - and she was playing she was playing
49:38 - pretty well
49:41 - and then i and she she i think she was a
49:44 - younger sister
49:45 - or older sister i don't know whichever
49:47 - one is like slightly
49:48 - weaker in chess like so around
49:51 - 19 2000 but she had a phenomenal
49:53 - tournament
49:55 - and uh yeah so they're super cool
49:59 - and then i ran into eric rosen there too
50:01 - if you guys know him he's a big youtuber
50:03 - in chess
50:05 - and i'm just
50:06 - catching up with him because we're we've
50:07 - been good friends from a long time
50:12 - see it varies from this redistro but
50:15 - here on arch i use discord and zoom and
50:17 - it works totally fine installation is
50:18 - easy as blah blah not dealing with other
50:20 - installers like other os
50:22 - okay that's pretty cool zach i did not
50:25 - know that
50:26 - those things are working perfectly that
50:28 - is super cool
50:32 - i'm also a linux user but i use macbook
50:34 - air too they are both
50:37 - awesome
50:40 - see if i can pop them up
50:42 - they are both awesome os's linux has
50:45 - some free alternatives a paid mac os
50:47 - offer which are many times better than
50:48 - the paid one oh yeah so here's what i
50:50 - will say
50:52 - i think that if you can have both then
50:55 - that's really solid that is like the
50:58 - best system because then you can have
51:00 - like a legendary coding environment
51:03 - with linux
51:05 - and then you have your mac or you have
51:06 - your windows and then your gucci so if
51:08 - you're gonna have multiple i mean then
51:10 - yeah then there's no problem because
51:11 - like
51:12 - i was thinking about getting a windows
51:14 - but mostly for gaming stuff so
51:18 - yeah
51:26 - my dad taught me
51:28 - lunia says
51:31 - my dad taught me chess i love it random
51:34 - question how do i secure a mirn stack do
51:37 - you have a video
51:38 - secure as an add security to your murder
51:41 - stack
51:42 - i don't think we have videos on doing
51:45 - too much security honestly so
51:48 - we don't have something on it right now
51:50 - i don't think
51:54 - 456 votes
51:56 - and 32 percent of you said this studio
51:59 - that we have here costs 20 grand
52:06 - the right answer
52:08 - i'm going to say the right answer right
52:10 - now you guys ready
52:11 - the right answer
52:13 - the correct answer
52:17 - is
52:20 - let's see if i can pop it up here
52:28 - the correct answer
52:30 - is
52:32 - how can i turn this text white
52:37 - whites please give me white
52:41 - data
52:44 - this studio costs
52:47 - roughly around 30 000
52:50 - probably a little bit more
52:56 - especially with with getting more stuff
52:58 - so it's going to be a little bit more
53:00 - but yeah around there so
53:04 - you know
53:05 - not the most expensive studio by any
53:07 - means because it's like still relatively
53:09 - simple
53:10 - but like if you take the mac the mac is
53:13 - like eight grand
53:15 - and then you take the monitor that i
53:17 - just got on the side that i'm gonna put
53:19 - vertical is around three grand so a dell
53:23 - ultra fine 32 inch something
53:27 - if you combine all the license a couple
53:28 - of grand
53:30 - speakers
53:31 - grant
53:32 - camera a couple of grand
53:36 - road caster pro stream deck
53:39 - a bunch of other accessory stuff green
53:42 - screen gonna get
53:43 - bookshelves on the back
53:46 - plants
53:47 - white board
53:49 - photo tube lights
53:51 - and then
53:52 - some stuff that you guys can't even see
53:53 - yet honestly so maybe this wasn't
53:55 - totally fair
53:57 - but yeah if you add all that up
54:00 - you get
54:01 - something like this
54:04 - maybe i should make this a thumbnail huh
54:06 - this would actually be a lot better as a
54:07 - thumbnail
54:09 - what do you guys think should this be
54:10 - the thumbnail
54:13 - all right if we're gonna make this a
54:14 - thumbnail then uh
54:17 - let's see if we can add can we add drop
54:19 - shadow i mean it all i guess it already
54:21 - has drop shadow so that's good
54:27 - all right let's switch to
54:36 - here we go thumbnail time
54:41 - let's move this a little bit over
54:43 - actually
54:44 - right there
54:53 - i think it'd be better if i hit the
54:55 - green screen
54:56 - the thumbnail would look better without
54:58 - the green screen let me hide the green
55:00 - screen that's silly
55:13 - all right
55:15 - there we go green screen hidden
55:17 - now let's go here
55:34 - perfect there we go now you guys see how
55:38 - in the back end we get our thumbnails
55:41 - set up
55:42 - it's as easy as that
55:44 - that's it it's done
55:45 - we got the
55:46 - thumbnail yo what is up francisco
55:51 - michelle says wow that is a lot
55:55 - essential what is going on man nice to
55:58 - have you in here what is up frankie nice
56:01 - to see you brother
56:03 - strava clone that'd be fun to make
56:06 - will you build something
56:08 - you're awesome thank you michelle
56:09 - appreciate it
56:12 - um let me do another poll actually let's
56:15 - end this poll
56:16 - so 27 of you were roughly right good job
56:21 - let's do another poll
56:23 - content

56:58 - all right here we go
57:01 - uh
57:04 - so content you want to see next so let's
57:06 - go view js that's something completely
57:09 - wild let's go solidity let's go
57:13 - python as an option and let's go
57:17 - more react slash next gs
57:22 - and let's hit it and let's see what you
57:24 - guys want to see more of next
57:28 - and we could do tutorials we could do
57:30 - projects so
57:32 - we'll i'll kind of ask about that too
57:34 - after
57:35 - hey lance is here he goes wiggle wiggle
57:39 - what is up lancy

58:00 - crazy
58:01 - it falls there
58:04 - yo you guys are
58:06 - legit
58:08 - this gang is legit
58:29 - all right
58:32 - going through your guys's
58:34 - comments
58:38 - yeah
58:39 - i'm not sure how the quality is coming
58:40 - on acro on the stream
58:43 - looks good on my end but i think it
58:45 - should be i think it should be good
58:48 - um
58:49 - all right so the poll is getting some
58:51 - answers let's take a look at the poll
58:54 - oh heavy heavy
58:58 - you guys are asking for the react and
59:00 - next js stuff but let's see if the
59:02 - tides are going to turn
59:04 - soon
59:08 - aaron says i sing that song every day
59:11 - that's funny
59:13 - yeah that song is very addictive
59:16 - and like you can you can also hear the
59:18 - auto-tune in the back right
59:23 - whenever you sing that song you hear
59:25 - that auto-tune in the back
59:33 - awesome react native content appr yeah
59:36 - that definitely makes sense you guys
59:38 - want to see some good react native
59:40 - content
59:41 - yeah there's definitely a big delay oh
59:44 - crap i don't know it was a two minute
59:45 - delay uh
59:47 - i didn't want to do low latency because
59:49 - i wasn't sure what the late low latency
59:52 - does i wasn't sure if it like
59:57 - lowers the quality of my video and so
59:59 - like i don't want to take the chance
60:08 - awesome
60:10 - all right guys
60:11 - thank you so much for being on here i
60:14 - think we're gonna
60:16 - be wrapping it up
60:20 - jiggle no i'm kidding we're not gonna
60:21 - actually wrap i'm gonna wrap it up with
60:24 - a
60:25 - like wrapped eath okay
60:28 - i'm gonna wrap this up
60:30 - and then
60:31 - we'll
60:32 - catch up in the next one
60:34 - but so far i can see the poll you guys
60:37 - are looking for more react content and
60:39 - then i also see some python requests
60:41 - coming in hot
60:42 - so we might have
60:44 - python coming up soon too
60:48 - um
60:49 - i will not be teaching you guys how to
60:51 - code i mainframes in cobalt
60:56 - zacky
60:57 - just made me
60:58 - do a little uh
61:00 - little gag reflex action some acid
61:03 - reflux just
61:06 - going like this
61:12 - all right
61:13 - i thank you guys for being on here i
61:15 - appreciate the

is mainly to connect with you and so if you're in the chat or you're around definitely throw in some ideas or you know throw in some chats and i think what i would love to do as well with this is brainstorm and come up with a couple of you know different ideas with you as well about what type of content you would love to see on this channel hey how's it going hi sachin how are you doing nice to have you on here we have hairy minnie in the house let's go we got magesh magesh i see you on on the instagram i see on instagram so good to have you in here yo what is up zaki we got zaki vt it's been a while it's been a while what is up zzz hello what now hi gaming world hi cult patil hey jj trends hey ahmed raza hey jakka hi lawrence yeah finally a new video programmer marine says let me actually pop that up if i can show the setup yeah so there's a lot going on with this new studio i mean let me know how you guys like it as well but you know it's still in the process right you can see the kind of tv in the back uh right there that tv is not uh hooked up yet so we have to set it up because i got a new apartment so i moved to a brand new place and setting it up i wanted to make this studio look a lot better than all the previous studios i've had so the lighting setup is pretty cool i got two lights in the back i put some trees so it feels like i'm in a i'm in a jungle it doesn't just feel like i'm in this barren land um and then you know the the white board in the back of course yo what's up guys we got 140 people here what's up rnj communications joseph joe hey aryan how are you doing hi marouf hi jay communications yeah um it's hard for me to show the exact setup because my camera is right there right so let me actually figure something out and see if i can see if i can connect to my phone and show you guys from my phone so we'll take a we'll take a look real quick let's see if i can connect my phone as a source okay does that work oh that actually works beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so i can actually show you guys a setup now let me see if i can go this way oh unfortunately that does not work like i expected it to work okay so let me do this let me stay here and let's see if i can add a give me one second i apologize guys we're we're doing this live so my apologies okay whoops let's see can i switch this camera to the phone perfect let's go oh that allowed us to go wide on it too perfect all right that is a terrible view i'll just show it like this let's take this off i apologize so this is the setup right now that i have i got one light over here i have another light over there i got the camera right uh my second monitor where all the chats and kind of everything is coming in that i'm seeing my stream deck is right here stream deck allows me to control the lights if i press this button the lights go off press this button the lights come on right all of these lights right there i got the speakers set up and then what's cool about this monitor right here is it can tilt so when i'm coding i like to code on a like vertical monitor setup instead of like a um instead of a sideways setup you know how do you guys like the code by the way have you guys tried any vertical monitors because they're really really really cool like if you ever try a vertical monitor it's really cool by the way it's sachin's birthday so happy birthday sachin happy birthday yeah so vertical monitor like i can code all along and i don't have to scroll as much i can see the context of the entire like app in one go so if my coding productivity improves a lot when i have a vertical monitor set up it's planted there as you can see um clean setup yeah it's not super clean yet i'm working on making it clean uh it's it's decent it's decent it's definitely a decent setup but we've got to do a lot of improvement on it so let's see if i can switch my camera back here perfect okay so that wasn't too bad it wasn't too bad we we made it we made it work yeah all right what's going on why don't you make videos on data science kafka hadoop yeah that would actually be a fun idea i am not very good at data science so if i were to make videos they would be kind of from scratch and so it'd be like newbie videos if you guys are cool with that hey i'm down that would be fun um do you guys by the way do you guys do clean setup yeah you're an inspiration thank you man i appreciate that your phone's wallpaper is matt matt cute oh you guys saw that that's funny probably when i was locking it huh let's see man the frame behind is awesome you guys like that frame in the back yeah it's pretty dope right she's wearing um that's my girlfriend she's wearing boxing gloves because she's a pro boxer and now she's a pro wrestler so that's pretty cool and um i'm the dude with the laptop i just took on so i'm gonna also be kind of sharing life updates right like like i said in the start uh just because i haven't seen you guys in a while and i would love to kind of connect with every single person here you know it's been it's been a minute i've missed you guys honestly i've been doing too many recorded videos and i missed the thing about live streams hey jj trends just said hey i got my first fiverr order on javascript it's a 500 project that i learned by javascript in your videos let's go jj that is awesome man that is so cool let me pop that up on the screen that is awesome let's give that a big highlight right there let's see if i can still play my sounds okay there we go that's the clapping you guys let me know if you guys heard the sound of the clapping that'd be great awesome job jj real real proud of you man that is really cool super happy to hear that um aaron is um aaron is out doing his stuff he is you know uh yeah he's like killing it in everything that he's doing in life so aaron is not here right now yeah my gesh it's been it's been a while especially doing these lives man i missed this aryan says i watch a lot of your videos thank you aryan i appreciate it most definitely what's up yo front forum focus what is up um we definitely have a lot of react on the channel like every video has react i can't remember the last video that didn't have react except for this one right this one is not going to have that much react dope programmer says hey i got a chance to build social media because if you thank you thanks qazi i appreciate you as well thank you i'm happy that you're working on it i just completed your amazon clone it's so amazing 100 you got it yeah those react videos are a lot of fun honestly they're a lot of fun but every video that we do even if we're doing if even if we're doing these web 3 videos they are very heavily focused on react there's a lot of react in there so we're definitely not by any means cutting out react or doing less of it i think that we're doing even more of it because these projects are massive and then there's ton of react work that's happening in there oh some coding news that actually would be fun that's actually a great idea coding news like kind of what's new do you guys know any good websites for that um because there was something there's this blog app that's like pretty good or i forget what it's called but it like you go there and it shows you like a couple of trending blogs or what's going on in the developer world by the way i noticed your courses are very practical oriented have you considered covering some more of the academic stuff like data structures and algorithms yes so uh that is actually a really good idea we definitely have uh we're definitely that's something we're actually thinking about data structures and algorithms lance who's new on our team well he's not new anymore he's been working with us for over six months now but lance he's one of our bootcamp instructors and he is really good at data structures and algorithms so we've been thinking about him teaching some data structures and algorithm stuff on this channel that would be really really cool next js with typescript yep we're definitely doing we've done some typescript but yeah we're definitely doing a lot of next.js thank you for your react videos i recently got an internship as a react developer brilliant that makes me so happy to hear that is awesome really proud of you for that yo david what is up broski david is like cause he's flexing that uh because he's flexing the studio yeah yeah a little bit i'm flexing it and i'm also sharing with everybody the studio and uh you know just kind of showed them what i have in here would you guys want to know how much the studio costs or does anybody want to take a guess how much the studio costs let's see can i do a poll uh i can only add yes or no options it's kind of boring yeah take a guess i don't actually know at the top of my head how much it costs so i'll have to think about it but yeah take a guess and uh i'll let you guys know if you guys are in the right direction or not the person that gets guesses the closest how about this i'll paypal you i'll pay pal you uh fifty dollars okay how about that we'll keep it simple oh webassembly stuff zacky man i'm staying away from that webassembly bro aryan says 8 thousand dollars jj trent says 200 000 60 ten thousand dollars hmm interesting fifty thousand man you guys are uh you guys are guessing some massive numbers you could be right or you could be wrong i don't know david do you want to like calculate how much my studio is like roughly even if it's not exact and just text it to me don't post it in youtube chat but text it to me and i'll take a look at it 20k okay between one and two million dollars yeah that would be a really nice studio huh one trillion dollars no audio you guys should be able to hear my audio right i hope so i hope so my keyboard is a very simple keyboard this my keyboard is just the apple keyboard regular one it's very dirty but it's the apple keyboard as you can see right regular keyboard i used to have a mechanical keyboard but then i decided to not use a mechanical keyboard anymore because it has a windows key most of the times and it's kind of annoying because apple you don't have that key and then there's alt and apple doesn't have alt apple has like option and control and so then it doesn't really work and then my f3 and my f4 buttons and my brightness buttons like they don't really work as normally as you would expect 7200 boom let's see um all right david is uh david is giving me kind of some guesses hey i've already shown my board buddy maybe you wanna thank you amanath i appreciate that good work good work good work uh if anybody wants to jump on the stream to do an interview or something do let me know that could be cool because we could definitely set that up tried any functional programming stuff yeah functional programming is a lot of fun but i haven't been trying anything functional programming recently except i'm just doing a lot of functional programming in javascript but yeah i was doing closure and things of that nature audio is good right can somebody communicate yeah yeah people are saying good audio but some people are saying no audio but then some people saying audio is gucci hmm that is confusing man matec matex says it is where's my tech montage my bad my touch says it's nine k my studio setup nine thousand dollars and then i'll put on some guesses all right i'll i'll put up some guesses at this point and you guys pick honestly guys i apologize i don't even know who's the closest one oh wait i know there's a few people who are pretty close actually um there's one person that got it exact like on the dot a few people that got on the dot so i apologize i'll have to pick one person kind of randomly even if multiple people got it but if you took multiple guesses and they were different i don't think i'll count you you have to pick one and stick with it there's some people who are guessing everything and no that's not happening that is not happening you have to pick one guess and stick with it uh david can you write down the names of everybody who's like either got it or is extremely close and just like write down those names not in the chat not in the chat not in youtube chat but like just text me on my phone that'd be great yo another thing i got i got a freaking green screen you guys want to see the green screen i've never used a green screen before ever ever because i always thought it was so much work to set up the damn thing and it would take forever oh by the way i'm also training for a marathon so that's crazy if any of you are runners you should add me on strava you should add me on strava app i'd love to see your runs and push you and selfishly you'll push me and then i'll keep running and then i'll do my marathon my marathon is happening october 9th i believe october 9th so it's in 15 weeks less than four months so pretty scary pretty scary all right so my boy is collecting names now david and he'll find whoever is the closest and then one person wins and i'll send send you money through their paypal or crypto whatever is easiest for you well like we'll pick one person and you get 50 bucks okay all right guys we're now going to stop taking more answers for the studio after this point okay so amanath anything that's after the timestamp of 9 17 a.m pacific time don't take that anymore but the correct answer let me put up a poll let's put up a poll i'll add a few options okay a lot of few options boom let's go here and we'll say twenty thousand we'll say a hundred thousand we'll say five thousand all right so i'm gonna put this poll and uh you guys can take a guess on this poll as well all right let's see those answers coming in hot let's see what people are guessing some people are guessing 20k nice soon we'll do the reveal of how much this entire studio setup costs all right we'll announce the winner soon or probably later in the stream so stick around okay gives you another reason to stick around but uh there are some there are there are some people who guessed it very very accurate and uh we'll be picking you we'll be picking yeah yeah so that's what's going on um let me let me go here oh oh yeah did you guys say you wanted to see the green screen yeah no i can't remember well i don't care i'm gonna pop up the green screen because i never had it before so let me give me one second here there we go and i know it's not really doing anything right now but it does something once i start moving it closer to me okay so once i move the camera closer to me that's when it does something so take a look at this now i can be just chilling here right and i'm in the freaking screen yo like what that is so cool i don't know about you guys but i definitely find this setup really really cool being able to like kind of merge in and then if we're coding right like if there's some kind of coding going on it looks so much better coding like this so like in my new tutorials you know i definitely want to have um i definitely want to have some action like this right like isn't this a lot better instead of instead of like my screen before my screen was like so stupid it was i would do this do this right and it takes up like look at that that stupid square is blocking so much of the code and boom now there's like very little code that's being blocked or i could even like put myself on the other side and flip flip the camera or whatever right and then that gives that gives like even more space and just chill here right and then boom we're going through the code and it's like all right guys we're importing a bunch of stuff and then we're creating sidebar we have our sidebar option component and then it does stuff and let's check out our modal component big brains so yeah this just looks so much better so much better she's says your studio is lit thank you i appreciate it i appreciate it and as soon as i start dropping a green screen down it's gonna start showing the background behind me hey look at my hand oh and and one of the most awesome parts now i can point somebody said this in my team meeting yesterday i'm going to point to stuff so check it out this is my favorite part so like if i'm like trying to teach you something right for example you know what is this slicing business that's happening right over there let me let me uh let me mirror myself so i can like point accurately right so it's like hey what is that slicing stuff that's actually happening over there the slice of 39 or what are we doing here slicing from zero to six well what we're doing here is we're getting the first six strings of current account right and then we're getting the pretty much the last like from 39 on and i can i can literally move around like this and point to stuff and i don't know in my mind i feel like that'll make understanding what's going on actually a lot easier for you right so then that way i can like literally show you like this is the div that's doing the thing right this is the current user dot name that we need access to so i kind of love that and i can do that in my live streams i could do that you know when i'm recording a video um part says why are you not streaming a game i mean i think i would love to stream chess if you guys would want to watch because like i play chess competitively and i enjoy it a lot um so that's definitely something cool yeah programmer marine says that's a lot better yeah we have a lot of people saying aaron says yo that's a lot better uh mattel says yes it looks amazing thank you guys i appreciate that that looks so much better appreciate it appreciate it thank you aaron says big thank you story web 3 and react starting from your videos i appreciate you thank you so much yeah so this this setup is definitely pretty cool i mean i could even this is kind of cool like i could do my videos like this to show off that i'm a i'm a coder right like everything i do just has like this is probably how people just imagine me they just imagine that i just have like code in the background all the time just like oh must code just 24 7. i mean i kind of do so i kind of do code a lot all right so uh this is what's happening here and then going back to where we were yeah so add me on strava you guys add me on strava if anybody's using this app add me here i don't know what my username is but i think if you type in rafikaze you'll probably find me i'm not not exactly sure all right and yeah i'm a beginner runner pretty beginner very very newbie have terrible times at least for myself like 11 minute is fast for me i'm like dying at a oh you can't see anything oops sorry let me get out of your way so yeah like at 11 minutes i'm like kind of dying uh not very good so if i could use your help with that that'd be great my screen is moving at 20 frame rates per second is that true is my screen moving that slow i hope not i hope not the green screen is reducing the blocking of the code that's pretty good yeah because that used to be one of the very common complaints right every time somebody would be like you're blocking the code just so much anger and hate but we can avoid all that anger and hate by by just simply using a green screen in the back i'm surprised how good a green screen actually is like it's it's kind of mindblowing that it works as well as it does a strava is just a running app right here this right there just a running app and like you could use it to run and uh track stuff and like you could you could add friends on here and send friend requests and stuff like that so i don't know if anybody runs here at all but if you do feel free to add me on here let's go look at some coding news with this new setup hmm that's a good point real programming is an elitist myth i kind of like this because even without re oh my god is this one of those websites that begs you to pay them if you're even looking at it for one second seems like it but stop bothering us now so that's good we'll zoom in here look at this i'm in the freaking screen this is sick just my arm looks a little bit cut off but who cares who cares right this is fine it's not that bad um okay i have to do let's move it up a little bit so it doesn't cut my head off all the time there we go now i have headspace perfect yeah so i let me know what you guys think about this right real real programming is an elitist myth and i don't know about you guys but i kind of agree with this because um a lot of people will tell you hey pro there's real programming this is what a real programmer does a real programmer uses vim or a real programmer a real programmer uses the command line they don't use a gui to push their code they don't use a gui to use git and version control they use the command line oh you used an extension from vs code you are a noob you need to be using the command line more like that type of stuff right is just total [ __ ] because that's not true like you can code however you want and there are plenty of incredible programmers who are still using sublime text so blind text those days are gone you should just use either vs code or if you're going to use an online tool then use an online tool like replit or whatever but like don't use don't use sublime text guys i mean that's been that's it's over if you use sublime text you're not a real programmer you're a fake programmer but yeah like most things you guys are totally fine right like most whatever way that you code is your way of coding and it's okay like it's totally fine you don't have to freak out about it um going to come after you if you're using i mean you know some there's like some developers i know that we're using like notepad and text edit and like weird stuff to code and they're phenomenal developers so it's whatever your flow is you're gonna be fine and everybody codes in different ways for example i was never really good at data structures and algorithms yet i could build a ton of stuff so it does it didn't matter that i never got good at it or wasn't super interested in all the nerdy intricacies it's it's um coding is a there's a lot of creativity involved and i think people often forget that i use the regular default notepad because i'm godly aaron says i mean yo props to you man if you can pull that off that's huge you don't even need anything david says you can use a you can code however you want unless you use a gui that's for fake programmers only there you go you should i love this david says you should code on paper agreed if you want to be a real programmer i i definitely hate all that scrum solid agile uncle bob crap yeah i'm not a huge fan of uncle bob like that stuff was weird like when i was even watching that video just so long and this guy just thinks like he knows everything and it's just oh so frustrating like i can't even imagine being his wife like jesus christ man [ __ ] that is uh uncle bob is a interesting cat but yeah i watched a video a bunch and i'm just like this is this is crazy i'm not sure what's happening here yeah colorized theme yeah you're you're you're not a real developer alejandro says stop blocking the code hey i got this freaking green screen just so i oh i wasn't so i was blocking the code because there wasn't anything happening with the code earlier uh my chest elo is like 2000 to 2200 depending on the day time whether um my head being in the right place and me not being an idiot things like that yep so there is some programming news for you hopefully that was pretty good let's see what other things will catch our eyes the new startup no code no problem interesting so yeah there's this whole no code movement going on i am a big proponent of it i support it um jeez man pegging me for freaking emails no do not email me all right continue reading there we go that was easy you now you don't need to know any programming to launch a company we've been approaching this moment for years so basically what they're saying is there are tools like webflow zapier that allow you to like automate a bunch of stuff which yeah there is there's parts of it that are pretty true because you can you can glue together a lot of clever logic using zapier which makes sense right like so if you have an automation somebody opts into your email and then it sends them this thing and it sends them the next thing and then you can do a lot of that with zapier her company scribbly.io let's take a look at this let's look at this unbeatable content marketing services to grow your business book a strategy call tell us your goals and put your content on autopilot wow definitely looks really cool actually i would be interested in actually hitting them up so this looks super cool scribbly dot io i mean yeah so it looks like it's a basic website uh air table and online spreadsheet letter sort details about each job yep airtable is very very powerful tool if you use air table and use zapier and you use webflow you could do a lot of automation there yes that is that that is true uh she has 23 clients and was doing 25 000 in recurring business so basically at the time that this article was written the owner of this website was doing about 23 to 25 000 a month which is pretty good especially if you're a new business owner it's like really really good and i imagine you know you have a couple of people who are paying you this much and you're writing content for them and then they're just recurring customers so that's pretty good but here's the thing majority of this no code stuff will get you really far really really far but what i realized is even with the no code stuff you will still need to know some programming concepts actually pull it off like even with webflow and even with like cms's if you know some programming stuff it really benefits you and you build things a lot faster and why i like a lot of no code stuff is if you have an idea or you want to mvp you can do really really quick and just test it out and if you like it then you can spend the next few weeks coding it up because often times when you're coding something up the performance of that thing is going to be really really sharp and you're going to have a lot of finetuned control over it if you don't care about that much finetuned control over every single little aspect then yeah i recommend if you're building a sas or you're building something just use tools put it together but if you're at a job and you're at a company working and they have built something with react then you'll need to know react or if they have built something in web3 then you'll need to know wep3 in order to continue building on top of their software and to continue growing their software and to continue making that software more robust over time by the way on the topic of controversial opinions how do you feel about open source software in the fsf especially some of those extreme richard stallman stuff i haven't followed any of the fsf stuff i don't even know what that is or who richard stallman is but i know that linus torvals is a huge proponent of open software i am not against it i think it's really cool i was thinking about what open source software's i know that are really prominent and one of them that comes to my mind that i use pretty much every day is actually leeches leaches.org this thing and this is open source and this has like so much traffic i like this more than chess.com and most of the great players that i know actually play on here and the experience is awesome like playing here the experience is just so good i'll try not to play the entire game here but like the the entire experience of leaches is just in my opinion a lot better okay let's close out of it so it doesn't turn into a chess game and that's open source and uh if i go to if i go back to leaches you can see that it's open source where does it say again usually says on the home page that it's free let me go as incognito yep so lead chess is a free libre no ads open source chess server right and if i go to are github they often allow you to link you to their github twitch source code there we go source code and main backend and front end scala okay let's click that right boom there we go so all of the code is here for elite chess that is that is really phenomenal and you have 303 contributors helping make this a reality that is really really cool that you know that's something that would be really hard to pull off outside of something like this but you just have all these people coming in building it together and then they're really listening to the community and they're just making this phenomenal product and anybody that needs to add anything can just go ahead and code it up and actually help out an end result is such a brilliant and phenomenal product that leeches is and even their app is really really amazing so yeah i mean hats off to them for being able to pull this off and the whole interface just clean no ads nothing so i i like the open source movement i think it's great i also see the point of not open source right because that's also something i was thinking about on my run yesterday which is who's gonna pay for these people to be thinking about the thing 24 7 because they at some point need to do other things in their life right so open source yeah you'll code it up but then you need to actually put food on the table so then you're going to go do your job but with a job if you're working at microsoft or whatever you're making a hundred two hundred thousand dollars you can just fully focus and not worry about anything else and like literally do that for 10 12 hours a day that is a lot more fun and then you can build something really really great because you're obsessed about that thing and you're doing that thing every single day so within six months a year two years three years four years five years you're gonna build a better product that's why i think vs code is one of the best products out there and it's a private you know it's it's by microsoft it's not an open source software and um you know the best operating systems are not like i wouldn't use linux i tried linux it sucks i will never use it it's awful you can barely play a freaking normal video on there you don't have any editing tools you can barely even use the computer your email clients suck everything sucks like everything sucks zoom doesn't work properly it's it's trash um i honestly don't know why people use it they're like oh you could do sudo aptget who cares there's homebrew and there's all this other stuff that makes things easier so why are you sitting here and using linux like i don't know like i i just feel like it's people just being extra nerdy and just like oh i have a linux setup ah that's so cool like good for you but you know i don't know it's just um i i think either pick windows or pick mac and they're like mature operating systems they have actual support you can call support they'll help you and they have you know they're just very mature and then the whole native ecosystem syncs in and my imessages show up on my computer and they're synced with my phone and like my notifications work the right way and when i turn on focus mode it puts me on focus mode on my phone like the whole thing works right you know i personally think mac is the best of both worlds because you have this delicious gooey yummy native world along and then high performance along with like all the command line benefits you know so as a developer i that's one of the reasons i never go to windows because like first of all text rendering resolution i needed to be 5k i'm so used to it now that i need my text to render in 5k and i can tell when the text isn't rendering in 5k like and it doesn't look as good and so i've i avoid um anything like that and so yeah until windows has 5k monitors that's definitely one thing uh the other thing is just getting the whole command line and everything set up is always a pain with windows and there's always more annoying steps to do than if you're doing it just in plain mac or linux there's always like extra stuff that you have to do or there'll always be a tutorial they'll be like here's how to do this thing in five easy steps um but if you have a windows here's this other like sadistic complicated guide [ __ ] off like click this and just like figure it out yourself i'm not even gonna write the guide for you just like click this and and go somewhere else and figure it out so i feel like yeah window stuff is uh i don't know just makes me kind of like vomit a little in my mouth but you know you can still code on there like you'll be fine uh yeah muhammad says um i use windows but i have to admit that the windows command line sucks and it's worse than bash yeah that's that's all i'm saying like for coding and stuff it's always a problem to install stuff it's kind of a problem and i wish that they had a better command line system uh going on there um uh yeah zacky says hey i disagree with you derek qazi linux has its own place i use arch myself and i'll admit that windows and mac os is more friendly for the average user but calling linux trash flat out is so here's what i'll say if you're not if your main purpose is like just developing i think it's good you know i don't even know that vs code dude i don't know what they have like i'm not sure i don't even want to find out and like things are not even built for them properly but yeah like i think for coding it's probably good but then you have to have a zoom meeting and then like you have to share your screen and like zoom doesn't work properly and then sharing your screen like still shows all the people and it's kind of like annoying and it's like as a developer unfortunately you'll have more meetings then you'll get the right code and so i feel like all of those things work properly i wouldn't [ __ ] on linux this hard if they just build proper support for everything like for at least for like normal things like slack zoom like normal simple things that the whole world uses unless they build that i am just like it's trash and i want to run away and i also respect your opinion that you don't think it's trash you use it that's totally fine um i'll i can i could have gone full screen a while ago my bad that that rant who cares about pseudo that rant went on longer than i had expected my apologies where did my youtube studio go ah there it is that rant went on forever huh let's see did everybody go crazy in the comments was there a war yes some someone asked do you know the bota sisters yes i do know them not personally although i did run into the bodhis sisters um at the las vegas nationals uh no not nationals las vegas chess tournament and i saw botest there and she was playing she was playing pretty well and then i and she she i think she was a younger sister or older sister i don't know whichever one is like slightly weaker in chess like so around 19 2000 but she had a phenomenal tournament and uh yeah so they're super cool and then i ran into eric rosen there too if you guys know him he's a big youtuber in chess and i'm just catching up with him because we're we've been good friends from a long time see it varies from this redistro but here on arch i use discord and zoom and it works totally fine installation is easy as blah blah not dealing with other installers like other os okay that's pretty cool zach i did not know that those things are working perfectly that is super cool i'm also a linux user but i use macbook air too they are both awesome see if i can pop them up they are both awesome os's linux has some free alternatives a paid mac os offer which are many times better than the paid one oh yeah so here's what i will say i think that if you can have both then that's really solid that is like the best system because then you can have like a legendary coding environment with linux and then you have your mac or you have your windows and then your gucci so if you're gonna have multiple i mean then yeah then there's no problem because like i was thinking about getting a windows but mostly for gaming stuff so yeah my dad taught me lunia says my dad taught me chess i love it random question how do i secure a mirn stack do you have a video secure as an add security to your murder stack i don't think we have videos on doing too much security honestly so we don't have something on it right now i don't think 456 votes and 32 percent of you said this studio that we have here costs 20 grand the right answer i'm going to say the right answer right now you guys ready the right answer the correct answer is let's see if i can pop it up here the correct answer is how can i turn this text white whites please give me white data this studio costs roughly around 30 000 probably a little bit more especially with with getting more stuff so it's going to be a little bit more but yeah around there so you know not the most expensive studio by any means because it's like still relatively simple but like if you take the mac the mac is like eight grand and then you take the monitor that i just got on the side that i'm gonna put vertical is around three grand so a dell ultra fine 32 inch something if you combine all the license a couple of grand speakers grant camera a couple of grand road caster pro stream deck a bunch of other accessory stuff green screen gonna get bookshelves on the back plants white board photo tube lights and then some stuff that you guys can't even see yet honestly so maybe this wasn't totally fair but yeah if you add all that up you get something like this maybe i should make this a thumbnail huh this would actually be a lot better as a thumbnail what do you guys think should this be the thumbnail all right if we're gonna make this a thumbnail then uh let's see if we can add can we add drop shadow i mean it all i guess it already has drop shadow so that's good all right let's switch to here we go thumbnail time let's move this a little bit over actually right there i think it'd be better if i hit the green screen the thumbnail would look better without the green screen let me hide the green screen that's silly all right there we go green screen hidden now let's go here perfect there we go now you guys see how in the back end we get our thumbnails set up it's as easy as that that's it it's done we got the thumbnail yo what is up francisco michelle says wow that is a lot essential what is going on man nice to have you in here what is up frankie nice to see you brother strava clone that'd be fun to make will you build

and next js stuff but let's see if the tides are going to turn soon aaron says i sing that song every day that's funny yeah that song is very addictive and like you can you can also hear the autotune

yeah there's definitely a big delay oh crap i don't know it was a two minute delay uh i didn't want to do low latency because i wasn't sure what the late low latency does i wasn't sure if it like
