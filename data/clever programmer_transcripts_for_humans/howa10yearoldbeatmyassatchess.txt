00:00 - - Why and how can a 10-year-old
beat my ass at chess?
00:06 - I am top 1% in the world, I been doing it
00:09 - for over a decade, the
kid hasn't been doing it
00:11 - for a decade, what is going on?
00:13 - I wanna share that with
you, and I also wanna share
00:15 - from a perspective of how does that relate
00:18 - to your life as a developer,
as a Python developer,
00:21 - and how you can be that
kid who's 10 years old
00:26 - and beating all these
other developers' ass
00:30 - at programming, at earning
a high level income,
00:32 - at being irreplaceable, and at even
00:36 - getting these job opportunities.
00:38 - So with that said, let's
jump right into it.
00:41 - Hey guys, this is Papa Python,
also known as Rafeh Qazi,
00:46 - or Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:49 - Let's talk about this topic.
00:50 - How did a 10-year-old kid beat my ass
00:54 - at chess, beat me at chess, okay?
00:56 - And this kid, his name is
Awonder, he's not 10 any more,
01:00 - he's probably 12 now,
and he's a grand master,
01:03 - he's really good now, but
when he was playing me,
01:06 - he was so little that he
actually had to stand up on
01:09 - his table to move his
queen to actually deliver
01:12 - checkmate against me, and I
was super strong at that time.
01:16 - I was highly rated and I was playing
01:18 - at a competitive tournament,
so it just blew my mind
01:21 - how such a young kid could
actually accomplish this feat.
01:25 - And I wasn't joking around
either when I said I was good
01:28 - because I was putting in
about four hours a day
01:30 - since I was 14 into
chess until I was 19, 20.
01:37 - So, how does this kid be able to beat me?
01:41 - How does this kid do this, okay?
01:43 - Well, when you look past the
surface level, one is maybe
01:48 - he put in more hours than
me, which could be possible,
01:51 - but I kinda doubt it 'cause
he has so many other things
01:54 - he's doing and he's just a kid, right?
01:55 - But what is it that is actually going on?
01:59 - I think what's going
on is that he's working
02:01 - with his dad, all right, who
is pretty good chess player.
02:05 - And his dad is coaching him,
and what is his dad doing?
02:09 - His dad was able to
install these frameworks
02:12 - and strategies in his brain that allow him
02:15 - to learn at a much more rapid pace,
02:19 - that allowed him to excel
and improve his skillset
02:22 - at a much, much, much faster pace
02:24 - than anybody else, including myself.
02:26 - That's how this kid was
able to actually get better
02:30 - than me without actually
spending more time into chess.
02:33 - Whereas I might have been
doing the wrong things,
02:36 - practicing and learning the wrong things,
02:38 - he was practicing the right things.
02:40 - When we come to the world
of coding and programming,
02:43 - this is what happens
when people spend decades
02:46 - and they have all this
information on Google,
02:48 - like this is what it
takes to be a developer
02:50 - and this is how much
money they're earning.
02:52 - A lot of the times, the people
who can't get these jobs
02:55 - or the people who are giving
you advice that might be wrong,
02:58 - the reason is that they
might be more like me.
03:01 - They might be good, but they don't have
03:02 - the best strategies and
frameworks that help them excel.
03:06 - They basically have a poor framework,
03:09 - and they're too focused on
being self taught, okay?
03:13 - I was focused on being
self taught and even though
03:16 - I learned pretty fast, it
still wasn't that great
03:20 - and I didn't make that much of a progress
03:21 - and now I'm stalled at my rating,
03:23 - whereas this kid is now about to get
03:26 - grand master pretty soon
if he isn't already.
03:28 - So, what is the point?
03:30 - The point is if you are
looking to become an amazing
03:33 - developer, earn a higher income,
you don't necessarily need
03:38 - a decade of experience
to be able to do that.
03:41 - You don't necessarily need a high
03:43 - level degree to be able to do that.
03:46 - But, what you do need
is a right framework,
03:50 - right strategy, to actually
be able to learn these skills
03:54 - so that you can improve at a fast pace,
03:57 - not spend years, sometimes even decades,
04:00 - making these mistakes that stall people,
04:03 - make them earn a low income, or sometimes
04:06 - not even be able to get their first job,
04:07 - because I imagine most of you are trying
04:10 - to break in and get your
first job, all right?
04:15 - So, what you need to
understand from this video is
04:17 - what you need to focus on,
all right, is being able
04:22 - to get the right strategies and framework
04:25 - that allow you to learn at a faster pace.
04:27 - What makes a developer
an amazing developer
04:30 - are not actually the
skills that they know,
04:32 - though those are helpful, is their ability
04:35 - to learn new technologies, frameworks,
04:37 - and learn them really, really fast.
04:40 - So if you are a developer
and you go to a job,
04:42 - your roll is gonna change,
you're gonna be required
04:44 - to do new things, and you
have to figure them out quick.
04:48 - How do you actually
develop that, all right?
04:51 - What are the things you
need to do to be able
04:52 - to build that strong foundation,
04:54 - where you can learn any new challenge
04:56 - that's thrown at you, you
can learn those things.
04:58 - For example, when people
are looking to hire,
05:00 - they might look at a
project, your Python project,
05:02 - but the job actually might
be a Java language job,
05:06 - but they see that you
understand the concepts
05:08 - so they bring you in
and they're like okay,
05:10 - we imagine you could learn this job
05:12 - and then we imagine you
could do this project,
05:14 - how fast would you be able to do it?
05:15 - So, focus on developing
those tools and strategies
05:18 - for yourself and focus on
increasing your ability
05:24 - to actually learn things
and learn things faster
05:27 - so if there's a system that
you could develop, right,
05:30 - it would be, I would
suggest for you to focus
05:33 - on your problem solving
ability and your ability
05:36 - to develop a framework
for learning much faster.
05:39 - And one of the ways to do
that is to find outside help
05:42 - and to get mentors in your life.
05:45 - You can even do that
through local meet ups
05:47 - and find mentors who can
help you, who can see
05:51 - your weaknesses and they're
essentially like coaches, right?
05:53 - A boxing coach can be watching a fighter
05:56 - from the outside, and you know
it's like if you're throwing
05:58 - punches, to you they look
normal, but to the coach
06:03 - he can actually spot, and you're like hey,
06:05 - you're telegraphing, you're
throwing your right hand
06:07 - down as you throw your left, okay?
06:09 - So they can look from the outside
06:13 - and find what's wrong and help you fix it,
06:16 - that's essentially what you need.
06:17 - So make a note of that, and I do wanna say
06:21 - that in the next few days, oh, also,
06:23 - this is video nine, day
nine of the challenge
06:26 - that I have been doing,
which is super cool,
06:28 - so again if you wanna keep
up that 30 day challenge
06:31 - with me, you could choose to
code for 30 days in a row,
06:34 - you can follow all of my
behind the scenes action
06:37 - on Instagram, my handle is cleverqazi,
06:40 - so that would be super cool, you could
06:41 - do this challenge with
me, and with that said,
06:43 - I also did wanna let you know
that my Earn 1K with Python
06:49 - course will be coming out very soon.
06:52 - And in that course, what I wanna show you
06:55 - is how can you go from
being a complete zero
06:58 - to earning your first 1K,
and with your first 1K
07:01 - I wanna help you focus on
building a strong foundation
07:04 - where you could go on to
become a six figure developer.
07:08 - This is gonna be a shorter
course, but it's again
07:10 - focused on more transformation
rather than information
07:14 - so it's very simple and
it has the eight steps
07:17 - that I used and I leverage to become
07:20 - a software developer in a
very short amount of time
07:23 - and started getting freelancing clients
07:25 - and be able to eventually be able to hire
07:27 - other developers to work for me.
07:30 - It's not easy but it is simple
07:32 - and it is very step-by-step,
and for example,
07:35 - in one of the weeks, I
do give you a challenge
07:38 - and a task to go and find a mentor.
07:41 - And I even show where you can
go and what you need to do.
07:44 - There is an action step, there is a group
07:46 - that will hold you accountable,
as well, alongside you,
07:50 - and you go week by week, all right?
07:52 - So hopefully the eight steps
you're gonna do in eight weeks.
07:55 - So, with that said, thank
you so much for watching.
07:59 - Lastly, go below and click on the links,
08:02 - either cleverprogrammer.com or
08:04 - the Earn 1K course page if we
have made it by that point.
08:08 - Pop in your email and I
will not only send you
08:12 - this epic master class I
have, I will also send you,
08:16 - as soon as that course opens up,
08:18 - you will be the first one to know, okay?
08:21 - So again, thank you so much for watching.
08:23 - I love your beautiful face.
08:25 - We're gonna keep going as always.
08:28 - I'll see you in the next video.
